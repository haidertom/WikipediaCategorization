Herbert's vision of a people forced by circumstance into total ecological awareness is worked out in convincing details ... What sets these books apart from their competitors is the obsessive quality of Herbert's imagination ... To read the ''Dune'' trilogy is to plunge into someone else's obsession ... Virtually every page in the trilogy contains a sentence that hints at the momentousness of the events being described. This is where the religiosity comes in. Herbert keeps interrupting the action with quotes from made-up sources that reinforce the atmosphere of millennial conflict and resolution. Taken out of context, these passages sound silly, like the words of wisdom spoken by Oriental sages on a TV sound stage ... But the whole point of an obsession is that it cannot be criticized from the outside; what distinguishes a successful obsessional tale from a failure that the reader is held, like Coleridge's Wedding Guest, so that 'he cannot choose but hear', no matter what his other faculties tell him.

His vision of peace is corrupted by dogmatic religious bureaucrats, and his once-noble desert tribes, the Fremen, grow fat and wealthy on the spoils of war and the de-desertification of Dune.\n\n==Synopsis==\nNine years after Emperor Paul Muad'Dib walked into the desert, blind, the ecological transformation of [[Arrakis|Dune]] has reached the point where some Fremen are living without [[stillsuit]]s in the less arid climate and have started to move out of the sietches and into the villages and cities. As the old ways erode, more and more pilgrims arrive to experience the planet of Muad'Dib. The Imperial high council has lost its political might and is powerless to control the Jihad.\n\nPaul's young twin children, Leto II and Ghanima, have concluded that their guardian Alia has succumbed to [[abomination (Dune)|abomination]]\u2014the possession by one of her ancestors\u2014and fear that a similar fate awaits them. They (and Alia) also realize that the [[terraforming]] of Dune will kill all the [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]], thus destroying the source of the spice, but the thing which has possessed Alia desires this outcome. Leto also fears that, like his father, he will be trapped by his prescience.\n\nPossessed by the persona of her grandfather [[Vladimir Harkonnen|Baron Vladimir Harkonnen]], Alia fears that her mother [[Lady Jessica]], about to return to Arrakis, will recognize her abomination. Meanwhile, a new religious figure called \"The Preacher\" has risen in the desert, railing against the religious government's injustices and the changes among the Fremen. Some Fremen believe he is Paul Atreides. Princess [[Wensicia]] of the fallen House Corrino on [[Salusa Secundus]] plots to assassinate the twins and regain power.\n\nJessica returns to Arrakis and recognizes that her daughter has been possessed, but finds no signs of abomination in the twins. Leto arranges for Fremen leader [[Stilgar]] to protect his sister if there is an attempt on their lives. The Preacher journeys to Salusa Secundus to meet Wensicia's son [[Farad'n]], and in return pledges [[Duncan Idaho]] as an agent of House Corrino. Alia attempts to assassinate Jessica, who escapes into the desert with Duncan's help, precipitating a rebellion among the Fremen. The twins anticipate and survive the Corrino assassination plot. Leto leaves to seek out the Preacher while Ghanima, masking her memory with self-hypnosis, reports falsely that her brother had been murdered. Duncan and Jessica flee to Salusa Secundus where Jessica begins to mentor the Corrino heir. He seizes power from his regent mother Wensicia and allies with the [[Bene Gesserit]], who promise to marry him to Ghanima and support his bid for coronation as Emperor.\n\nA band of Fremen outlaws capture Leto and force him to undergo the spice trance at the suggestion of [[Gurney Halleck]], who has infiltrated the group on Jessica's orders. His spice-induced visions show him a myriad of possible futures where humanity has become extinct and only one where humanity survives. He names this future \"The [[Golden Path (Dune)|Golden Path]]\" and resolves to bring it to fruition\u2014something that his father, who had already glimpsed this future, refused to do. He escapes his captors and sacrifices his humanity in pursuit of the Golden Path by physically fusing with a school of sandtrout, gaining superhuman strength and near-invulnerability. He travels across the desert and confronts the Preacher who does, in fact, prove to be Paul.\n\nDuncan returns to Arrakis and provokes Stilgar into killing him. With Stilgar's neutrality now untenable, he seizes Ghanima and flees. Alia recaptures Ghanima and arranges her marriage to Farad'n, planning to exploit the expected chaos when Ghanima kills him to avenge her brother's murder. The Preacher and Leto return to the capital to confront Alia, who has the Preacher murdered, revealing his true identity. Leto reveals himself in a display of superhuman strength and triggers the return of Ghanima's genuine memories. He confronts Alia and offers to help her overcome her possession, but she is overwhelmed by her ancestral personae and elects to commit suicide.\n\nLeto declares himself Emperor and asserts control over the Fremen. Farad'n enlists in his service and delivers control of the Corrino armies. The seemingly immortal and omnipotent Leto is left as Emperor of the Known Universe, with Ghanima at his side. Leto symbolically marries her, but allows her to take Farad'n (renamed Harq al-Ada, \"Breaking of Habit\", and appointed Royal Scribe) as her consort so the Atreides line can continue.\n\n==Reception==\nInitially selling over 75,000 copies, ''Children of Dune'' became the first hardcover best-seller ever in the science fiction field.<ref name=\"Touponce 119\"/> The novel was critically well-received for its gripping plot, action, and atmosphere,<ref name=\"NYT 1976\"/> and was nominated for the [[Hugo Award]] for [[Hugo Award for Best Novel|Best Novel]] in 1977.<ref name=\"Hugo77\"/>\n\nIn a 1976 review, [[Spider Robinson]] found ''Children of Dune'' unsatisfying, faulting the ending as unconvincing and thematically overfamiliar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Galaxy Bookshelf |first=Spider |last=Robinson |authorlink=Spider Robinson|work=[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]|date=September 1976|pages=111\u201313}}</ref> The novel is referenced in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980) by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Deleuze, Gilles |author2=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1993 |pages=390, 559 |isbn=0-8166-1402-4 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nReviewing ''Children of Dune'', [[David Pringle]] gave the novel a rating of two stars out of four and described the novel as \"dark and convoluted stuff.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=David |last=Pringle |authorlink=David Pringle |title=The Ultimate Guide To Science Fiction |location=New York |publisher=Pharos Books: [[St. Martin's Press]] |date=1990 |isbn=0886875374 |page=58 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{isfdb title|id=2247}}\n\n{{Dune franchise}}\n{{Frank Herbert}}\n\n[[Category:1976 American novels]]\n[[Category:1976 science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Frank Herbert]]\n[[Category:Dune novels]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Analog Science Fiction and Fact]]\n[[Category:Novels first published in serial form]]\n[[Category:Novels set on fictional planets]]\n[[Category:G.

Voltaire concludes with Candide, if not rejecting Leibnizian optimism outright, advocating a deeply practical precept, \"we must cultivate our garden\", in lieu of the Leibnizian mantra of Pangloss, \"all is for the best\" in the \"[[best of all possible worlds]]\".\n\n''Candide'' is characterized by its  tone as well as by its erratic, fantastical, and fast-moving plot. A [[picaresque novel]] with a story similar to that of a more serious coming-of-age narrative (''[[Bildungsroman]]''), it parodies many adventure and romance clich\u00e9s, the struggles of which are caricatured in a tone that is bitter and matter-of-fact. Still, the events discussed are often based on historical happenings, such as the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].<ref name=mason10>Mason (1992), p. 10</ref> As philosophers of Voltaire's day contended with the [[problem of evil]], so does Candide in this short novel, albeit more directly and humorously. Voltaire ridicules religion, theologians, governments, armies, philosophies, and philosophers. Through [[allegory|Candide]], he assaults [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and his optimism.<ref name = davidson54/><ref name=aldridge260>Aldridge (1975), p. 260</ref><!--aldridge sources \"insight into the human condition\" -->\n\n''Candide'' has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, the book was widely banned to the public because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition, and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of na\u00efvet\u00e9.<ref name = davidson54/> However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, ''Candide'' is recognized as Voltaire's ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]''<ref name = davidson54/> and is often listed as part of the [[Western canon]]. It is among the most frequently taught works of [[French literature]].<ref>Waldinger (1987), p. ix</ref> The British poet and literary critic [[Martin Seymour-Smith]] listed ''Candide'' as one of the [[The 100 Most Influential Books Ever Written|100 most influential books ever written]].\n\n== Historical and literary background ==\nA number of historical events inspired Voltaire to write ''Candide'', most notably the publication of Leibniz's \"[[Monadology]]\", a short metaphysical treatise, the [[Seven Years' War]], and the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]].  Both of the latter catastrophes are frequently referred to in ''Candide'' and are cited by scholars as reasons for its composition.<ref name=wade1959b88>Wade (1959b), p. 88</ref> The 1755 Lisbon earthquake, tsunami, and resulting fires of [[All Saints' Day]], had a strong influence on theologians of the day and on Voltaire, who was himself disillusioned by them. The earthquake had an especially large effect on the contemporary doctrine of optimism, a philosophical system which implies that such events should not occur. Optimism is founded on the [[theodicy]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and says all is for the best because God is a benevolent deity. This concept is often put into the form, \"all is for the best in the best of all possible worlds\" ({{lang-fr|Tout est pour le mieux dans le meilleur des mondes possibles}}). Philosophers had trouble fitting the horrors of this earthquake into their optimistic [[world view]].<ref name=radner669>Radner & Radner (1998), pp. 669\u2013686</ref>\n\n[[File:1755 Lisbon earthquake.jpg|thumb|left|350px|This 1755 copper engraving shows the ruins of [[Lisbon]] in flames and a [[tsunami]] overwhelming the ships in the harbour.]]\nVoltaire actively rejected Leibnizian optimism after the natural disaster, convinced that if this were the best possible world, it should surely be better than it is.<ref name=mason4>Mason (1992), p. 4</ref> In both ''Candide'' and {{lang|fr|[[Po\u00e8me sur le d\u00e9sastre de Lisbonne]]}} (\"Poem on the Lisbon Disaster\"), Voltaire attacks this optimist belief.<ref name=radner669/> He makes use of the Lisbon earthquake in both ''Candide'' and his {{lang|fr|Po\u00e8me}} to argue this point, sarcastically describing the catastrophe as one of the most horrible disasters \"in the best of all possible worlds\".<ref name=wade1959b93>Wade (1959b), p. 93</ref> Immediately after the earthquake, unreliable rumours circulated around Europe, sometimes overestimating the severity of the event. Ira Wade, a noted expert on Voltaire and ''Candide'', has analyzed which sources Voltaire might have referenced in learning of the event. Wade speculates that Voltaire's primary source for information on the Lisbon earthquake was the 1755 work {{lang|fr|Relation historique du Tremblement de Terre survenu \u00e0 Lisbonne}} by Ange Goudar.<ref name=\"wade1959b 88, 93\">Wade (1959b), pp. 88, 93</ref>\n\nApart from such events, contemporaneous stereotypes of the German personality may have been a source of inspiration for the text, as they were for {{lang|la|[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]}},{{sfn|Grimmelshausen|1669}} a 1669 satirical picaresque novel written by [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen]] and inspired by the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The protagonist of this novel, who was supposed to embody stereotypically German characteristics, is quite similar to the protagonist of ''Candide''.<ref name = aldridge251254/> These stereotypes, according to Voltaire biographer [[Alfred Owen Aldridge]], include \"extreme credulousness or sentimental simplicity\", two of Candide's and Simplicius's defining qualities. Aldridge writes, \"Since Voltaire admitted familiarity with fifteenth-century German authors who used a bold and buffoonish style, it is quite possible that he knew {{lang|la|Simplicissimus}} as well.\"<ref name = aldridge251254/>\n\nA satirical and parodic precursor of ''Candide'', [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726) is one of ''Candide''{{'}}s closest literary relatives. This satire tells the story of \"a gullible ingenue\", Gulliver, who (like Candide) travels to several \"remote nations\" and is hardened by the many misfortunes which befall him. As evidenced by similarities between the two books, Voltaire probably drew upon ''Gulliver's Travels'' for inspiration while writing ''Candide''.<ref>Havens (1973), pp. 844\u2013845</ref> Other probable sources of inspiration for ''Candide'' are {{lang|fr|[[Les Aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque|T\u00e9l\u00e9maque]]}} (1699) by [[Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9nelon]] and {{lang|fr|Cosmopolite}} (1753) by Louis-Charles Fougeret de Monbron. ''Candide''{{'}}s parody of the {{lang|de|Bildungsroman}} is probably based on {{lang|fr|T\u00e9l\u00e9maque}}, which includes the prototypical parody of the tutor on whom Pangloss may have been partly based. Likewise, Monbron's protagonist undergoes a disillusioning series of travels similar to those of Candide.<ref name = aldridge251254/><ref>Wade (1959b), p. 296</ref><ref>Broome (1960), p. 510</ref><!--SOURCE for more info on the connection to Monbron, see:\n* Voltaire and Fougeret de Monbron a \"Candide\" Problem Reconsidered\n* J.

He had been made a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]] in 1746. He was a [[deist]], a strong proponent of religious freedom, and a critic of [[tyranny|tyrannical]] governments. ''Candide'' became part of his large, diverse body of philosophical, political and artistic works expressing these views.<ref name=means>Means (2006), pp. 1\u20133</ref><ref name=Gopnik>Gopnik (2005)</ref> More specifically, it was a model for the eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century novels called the ''[[Philosophical novel|contes philosophiques]]''.

Despite solid evidence for these claims, a popular legend persists that Voltaire wrote ''Candide'' in three days. This idea is probably based on a misreading of the 1885 work {{lang|fr|La Vie intime de Voltaire aux D\u00e9lices et \u00e0 Ferney}} by [[Lucien Perey]] (real name: Clara Ad\u00e8le Luce Herpin) and Gaston Maugras.<ref name=\"wade1956\" /><ref>Havens (1932), p. 225</ref> The evidence indicates strongly that Voltaire did not rush or improvise ''Candide'', but worked on it over a significant period of time, possibly even a whole year.

By the former scheme, the first half of ''Candide'' constitutes the [[rising action]] and the last part the [[falling action|resolution]]. This view is supported by the strong theme of travel and quest, reminiscent of adventure and [[picaresque]] novels, which tend to employ such a [[dramatic structure]].<ref name=williams2627>Williams (1997), pp. 26\u201327</ref> By the latter scheme, the thirty chapters may be grouped into three parts each comprising ten chapters and defined by locale: I\u2013X are set in Europe, XI\u2013XX are set in the [[Americas]], and XXI\u2013XXX are set in Europe and the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=Beck203>Beck (1999), p. 203</ref><ref>Leister (1985), pp. 32\u201333</ref> The plot summary that follows uses this second format and includes Voltaire's additions of 1761.\n\n=== Chapters I\u2013X ===\nThe tale of ''Candide'' begins in the castle of the Baron Thunder-ten-Tronckh in [[Westphalia]], home to: the Baron's daughter, Lady Cun\u00e9gonde; his [[Illegitimacy|bastard]] nephew, Candide; a tutor, Pangloss; a [[maid|chambermaid]], Paquette; and the rest of the Baron's family. The [[protagonist]], Candide, is romantically attracted to Cun\u00e9gonde. He is a young man of \"the most unaffected simplicity\" ({{lang|fr|l'esprit le plus simple}}), whose face is \"the true index of his mind\" ({{lang|fr|sa physionomie annon\u00e7ait son \u00e2me}}).<ref name = aldridge251254/> Dr. Pangloss, professor of \"{{lang|fr|m\u00e9taphysico-th\u00e9ologo-cosmolonigologie}}\" (English: \"[[Metaphysics|metaphysico]]-[[Theology|theologo]]-cosmoronology\") and self-proclaimed optimist, teaches his pupils that they live in the \"[[best of all possible worlds]]\" and that \"all is for the best\".\n\n[[File:VoltaireCandidFrontis+Chap01-1762.jpg|thumb|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] and first page of chapter one of an early English translation by T. Smollett et al. of [[Voltaire]]'s ''Candide'', printed by [[John Newbery]], 1762]]\nAll is well in the castle until Cun\u00e9gonde sees Pangloss sexually engaged with Paquette in some bushes. Encouraged by this show of affection, Cun\u00e9gonde drops her handkerchief next to Candide, enticing him to kiss her. For this infraction, Candide is evicted from the castle, at which point he is captured by [[Bulgars|Bulgar]] ([[Prussia]]n) recruiters and coerced into military service, where he is [[Flagellation|flogged]], nearly executed, and forced to participate in a major battle between the Bulgars and the [[Avars (Caucasus)|Avars]] (an [[allegory]] representing the Prussians and the French). Candide eventually escapes the army and makes his way to Holland where he is given aid by Jacques, an [[Anabaptist]], who strengthens Candide's optimism. Soon after, Candide finds his master Pangloss, now a beggar with [[syphilis]]. Pangloss reveals he was infected with this disease by Paquette and shocks Candide by relating how Castle Thunder-ten-Tronckh was destroyed by Bulgars, that Cun\u00e9gonde and her whole family were killed, and that Cun\u00e9gonde was [[rape]]d before her death. Pangloss is cured of his illness by Jacques, losing one eye and one ear in the process, and the three set sail to [[Lisbon]].\n\nIn Lisbon's harbor, they are overtaken by a vicious storm which destroys the boat. Jacques attempts to save a sailor, and in the process is thrown overboard. The sailor makes no move to help the drowning Jacques, and Candide is in a state of despair until Pangloss explains to him that Lisbon harbor was created in order for Jacques to drown. Only Pangloss, Candide, and the \"brutish sailor\" who let Jacques drown<ref name=\"Smollett 2008, Ch. 4\">Smollett (2008), Ch. 4. (\"{{lang|fr|matelot furieux}}\")</ref> survive the wreck and reach Lisbon, which is promptly hit by [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|an earthquake, tsunami and fire]] that kill tens of thousands. The sailor leaves in order to loot the rubble while Candide, injured and begging for help, is lectured on the optimistic view of the situation by Pangloss.\n\nThe next day, Pangloss discusses his optimistic philosophy with a member of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]], and he and Candide are arrested for heresy, set to be tortured and killed in an \"{{lang|pt|[[auto-da-f\u00e9]]}}\" set up to appease God and prevent another disaster. Candide is flogged and sees Pangloss hanged, but another earthquake intervenes and he escapes. He is approached by an old woman,<ref>Ch. 7. ({{lang|fr|la vieille}}\")</ref> who leads him to a house where Lady Cun\u00e9gonde waits, alive. Candide is surprised: Pangloss had told him that Cun\u00e9gonde had been raped and disemboweled. She had been, but Cun\u00e9gonde points out that people survive such things. However, her rescuer sold her to a Jewish merchant, Don Issachar, who was then threatened by a corrupt [[Grand Inquisitor]] into sharing her (Don Issachar gets Cun\u00e9gonde on Mondays, Wednesdays, and the [[Shabbat|sabbath day]]). Her owners arrive, find her with another man, and Candide kills them both. Candide and the two women flee the city, heading to the Americas.<ref name = ayer143145/> Along the way, Cun\u00e9gonde falls into self-pity, complaining of all the misfortunes that have befallen her. The old woman reciprocates by revealing her own tragic life: born the daughter of [[Pope Urban X]] and the Princess of [[Palestrina]], she was raped and enslaved by African pirates, witnessed violent civil wars in Morocco under the bloodthirsty King [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Moulay Isma\u00efl]] (during which her mother was [[dismemberment|drawn and quartered]]), suffered further slavery and famine, nearly died from a plague in Algiers, and had a buttock cut off to feed starving [[Janissaries]] during the [[Azov campaigns (1695\u201396)|Russian siege of Azov]]. After traversing all the [[Russian Empire]], she eventually became a servant of Don Issachar and met Cun\u00e9gonde.\n\n=== Chapters XI\u2013XX ===\nThe trio arrives in [[Buenos Aires]], where Governor Don Fernando d'Ibarra y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza asks to marry Cun\u00e9gonde. Just then, an [[alcalde]] (a Spanish fortress commander) arrives, pursuing Candide for killing the Grand Inquisitor. Leaving the women behind, Candide flees to [[Paraguay]] with his practical and heretofore unmentioned manservant, Cacambo.\n\n[[File:Moreau Sucre crop.jpg|left|thumb|1787 illustration of Candide and Cacambo meeting a maimed slave of the sugar mill near [[Suriname]] ]]\nAt a [[border post]] on the way to Paraguay, Cacambo and Candide speak to the [[commandant]], who turns out to be Cun\u00e9gonde's unnamed brother. He explains that after his family was slaughtered, the [[Jesuit]]s' preparation for his burial revived him, and he has since joined the order.<ref name = ayer143145/> When Candide proclaims he intends to marry Cun\u00e9gonde, her brother attacks him, and Candide runs him through with his rapier. After lamenting all the people (mainly priests) he has killed, he and Cacambo flee. In their flight, Candide and Cacambo come across two naked women being chased and bitten by a pair of monkeys. Candide, seeking to protect the women, shoots and kills the monkeys, but is informed by Cacambo that the monkeys and women were probably lovers.\n\nCacambo and Candide are captured by Oreillons, or Orejones; members of the [[Inca Empire|Inca]] nobility who widened the lobes of their ears, and are depicted here as the fictional inhabitants of the area. Mistaking Candide for a [[Jesuit]] by his robes, the Oreillons prepare to cook Candide and Cacambo; however, Cacambo convinces the Oreillons that Candide killed a Jesuit to procure the robe. Cacambo and Candide are released and travel for a month on foot and then down a river by canoe, living on fruits and berries.<ref name=\"genius.com\">https://genius.com/Voltaire-candide-xviii-annotated</ref>\n\nAfter a few more adventures, Candide and Cacambo wander into [[El Dorado]], a geographically isolated [[utopia]] where the streets are covered with precious stones, there exist no priests, and all of the king's jokes are funny.<ref>Aldridge (1975), p. 254</ref> Candide and Cacambo stay a month in El Dorado, but Candide is still in pain without Cun\u00e9gonde, and expresses to the king his wish to leave. The king points out that this is a foolish idea, but generously helps them do so. The pair continue their journey, now accompanied by one hundred red pack sheep carrying provisions and incredible sums of money, which they slowly lose or have stolen over the next few adventures.\n\nCandide and Cacambo eventually reach [[Suriname]], where they split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cun\u00e9gonde, while Candide prepares to travel to Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local men who have been through various ill-fortunes and settles on a man named Martin.\n\n=== Chapters XXI\u2013XXX ===\nThis companion, Martin, is a [[Manichaean]] [[scholar]] based on the real-life pessimist [[Pierre Bayle]], who was a chief opponent of Leibniz.<ref>Wootton (2000), p. xvii</ref> For the remainder of the voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it is all he knows. After a detour to [[Bordeaux]] and [[Paris]], they arrive in England and see an admiral (based on [[John Byng|Admiral Byng]]) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time \"''pour l'encouragement des autres''\" (to encourage the others).<ref>This is one of the most famous quotes from the novel.

Upon their arrival in [[Venice]], Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis, in Venice. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with a [[Theatines|Theatine]] monk, Brother Girofl\u00e9e. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousand [[piastre]]s to Paquette and one thousand to Brother Girofl\u00e9e.\n\nCandide and Martin visit the Lord Pococurante, a noble Venetian. That evening, Cacambo\u2014now a slave\u2014arrives and informs Candide that Cun\u00e9gonde is in [[Constantinople]]. Prior to their departure, Candide and Martin dine with six strangers who had come for [[Carnival of Venice]]. These strangers are revealed to be dethroned kings: the Ottoman Sultan [[Ahmed III]], Emperor [[Ivan VI of Russia]], [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (an unsuccessful pretender to the English throne), [[Augustus III of Poland]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], and [[Theodore of Corsica]].\n\nOn the way to Constantinople, Cacambo reveals that Cun\u00e9gonde\u2014now horribly ugly\u2014currently washes dishes on the banks of the [[Sea of Marmara|Propontis]] as a slave for a [[Transylvania]]n prince by the name of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]. After arriving at the [[Bosphorus]], they board a [[galley]] where, to Candide's surprise, he finds Pangloss and Cun\u00e9gonde's brother among the rowers. Candide buys their freedom and further passage at steep prices.<ref name=ayer143145>Ayer (1986), pp. 143\u2013145</ref> The baron and Pangloss relate how they survived, but despite the horrors he has been through, Pangloss's optimism remains unshaken: \"I still hold to my original opinions, because, after all, I'm a philosopher, and it wouldn't be proper for me to recant, since Leibniz cannot be wrong, and since [[pre-established harmony]] is the most beautiful thing in the world, along with the [[Plenism|plenum]] and [[Subtle body|subtle matter]].\"<ref name=bair107108>Voltaire [1759] (1959), pp. 107\u2013108</ref>\n\nCandide, the baron, Pangloss, Martin, and Cacambo arrive at the banks of the Propontis, where they rejoin Cun\u00e9gonde and the old woman. Cun\u00e9gonde has indeed become hideously ugly, but Candide nevertheless buys their freedom and marries Cun\u00e9gonde to spite her brother, who forbids Cun\u00e9gonde from marrying anyone but a baron of the Empire (he is secretly sold back into slavery). Paquette and Brother Girofl\u00e9e\u2014having squandered their three thousand piastres\u2014are reconciled with Candide on a small farm ({{lang|fr|une petite m\u00e9tairie}}) which he just bought with the last of his finances.\n\nOne day, the protagonists seek out a [[dervish]] known as a great philosopher of the land. Pangloss asks him why Man is made to suffer so, and what they all ought to do. The dervish responds by asking rhetorically why Pangloss is concerned about the existence of evil and good. The dervish describes human beings as mice on a ship sent by a king to Egypt; their comfort does not matter to the king. The dervish then slams his door on the group. Returning to their farm, Candide, Pangloss, and Martin meet a [[Turkish people|Turk]] whose philosophy is to devote his life only to simple work and not concern himself with external affairs. He and his four children cultivate a small area of land, and the work keeps them \"free of three great evils: boredom, vice, and poverty.\"<ref name=bair113>Voltaire [1759] (1959), p. 112,113</ref> Candide, Pangloss, Martin, Cun\u00e9gonde, Paquette, Cacambo, the old woman, and Brother Girofl\u00e9e all set to work on this \"commendable plan\" ({{lang|fr|louable dessein}}) on their farm, each exercising his or her own talents. Candide ignores Pangloss's insistence that all turned out for the best by necessity, instead telling him \"we must cultivate our garden\" ({{lang|fr|il faut cultiver notre jardin}}).<ref name=\"bair113\" />\n\n== Style ==\nAs Voltaire himself described it, the purpose of ''Candide'' was to \"bring amusement to a small number of men of wit\".<ref name = aldridge251254/> The author achieves this goal by combining his sharp wit with a fun parody of the classic adventure-romance plot. Candide is confronted with horrible events described in painstaking detail so often that it becomes humorous. Literary theorist Frances K. Barasch described Voltaire's matter-of-fact narrative as treating topics such as mass death \"as coolly as a weather report\".<ref name=barasch3>Barasch (1985), p. 3</ref> The fast-paced and improbable plot\u2014in which characters narrowly escape death repeatedly, for instance\u2014allows for compounding tragedies to befall the same characters over and over again.<ref name=starobinski194>Starobinski (1976), p. 194</ref> In the end, ''Candide'' is primarily, as described by Voltaire's biographer Ian Davidson, \"short, light, rapid and humorous\".<ref name = davidson54/><ref name=wade1959b133>Wade (1959b), p. 133</ref>\n\nBehind the playful fa\u00e7ade of ''Candide'' which has amused so many, there lies very harsh criticism of contemporary European civilization which angered many others. European governments such as France, Prussia, Portugal and England are each attacked ruthlessly by the author: the French and Prussians for the Seven Years' War, the Portuguese for their [[Portuguese Inquisition|Inquisition]], and the British for the execution of [[John Byng]]. Organised religion, too, is harshly treated in ''Candide''. For example, Voltaire mocks the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Aldridge provides a characteristic example of such anti-clerical passages for which the work was banned: while in [[Paraguay]], Cacambo remarks, \"[The Jesuits] are masters of everything, and the people have no money at all&nbsp;\u2026\". Here, Voltaire suggests the [[Jesuit reduction|Christian mission in Paraguay]] is taking advantage of the local population. Voltaire depicts the Jesuits holding the indigenous peoples as slaves while they claim to be helping them.<ref>Aldridge (1975), p. 255</ref><ref name=\"ayer139\" />\n\n=== Satire ===\nThe main method of ''Candide''{{'}}s satire is to contrast ironically great tragedy and comedy.<ref name = davidson54/> The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world\u2014it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire to simplify subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws.<ref name=\"starobinski194\" /> Thus ''Candide'' derides optimism, for instance, with a deluge of horrible, historical (or at least plausible) events with no apparent redeeming qualities.<ref name = aldridge251254/><ref name=barasch3/>\n\nA simple example of the satire of ''Candide'' is seen in the treatment of the historic event witnessed by Candide and Martin in [[Portsmouth]] harbour. There, the duo spy an anonymous admiral, supposed to represent [[John Byng]], being executed for failing to properly engage a French fleet. The admiral is blindfolded and shot on the deck of his own ship, merely \"to encourage the others\" ({{lang-fr|pour encourager les autres}}). This depiction of military punishment trivializes Byng's death. The dry, pithy explanation \"to encourage the others\" thus satirises a serious historical event in characteristically Voltairian fashion. For its classic wit, this phrase has become one of the more often quoted from ''Candide''.<ref name=davidson54/><ref name=havens843>Havens (1973), p. 843</ref>\n\nVoltaire depicts the worst of the world and his pathetic hero's desperate effort to fit it into an optimistic outlook. Almost all of ''Candide'' is a discussion of various forms of evil: its characters rarely find even temporary respite. There is at least one notable exception: the episode of [[El Dorado]], a fantastic village in which the inhabitants are simply rational, and their society is just and reasonable. The positivity of El Dorado may be contrasted with the pessimistic attitude of most of the book. Even in this case, the bliss of El Dorado is fleeting: Candide soon leaves the village to seek Cun\u00e9gonde, whom he eventually marries only out of a sense of obligation.<ref name = aldridge251254/><ref name=barasch3/>\n<!--\n==== Picaresque ====-->\n\nAnother element of the satire focuses on what William F. Bottiglia, author of many published works on ''Candide'', calls the \"sentimental foibles of the age\" and Voltaire's attack on them.<ref name=bottiglia8992>Bottiglia (1968), pp. 89\u201392</ref> Flaws in European culture are highlighted as ''Candide'' parodies adventure and romance clich\u00e9s, mimicking the style of a [[picaresque novel]].<ref name=bottiglia8992/><ref>Vannini (2011), pp. 106\u2013107</ref> A number of archetypal characters thus have recognisable manifestations in Voltaire's work: Candide is supposed to be the drifting [[rogue (vagrant)|rogue]] of low [[class structure|social class]], Cun\u00e9gonde the sex interest, Pangloss the knowledgeable mentor and Cacambo the skilful valet.<ref name=aldridge251254>Aldridge (1975), pp. 251\u2013254</ref> As the plot unfolds, readers find that Candide is no rogue, Cun\u00e9gonde becomes ugly and Pangloss is a stubborn fool. The characters of ''Candide'' are unrealistic, two-dimensional, mechanical, and even [[marionette]]-like; they are simplistic and stereotypical.<ref name=wade1959b303>Wade (1959b), pp. 303\u2013305</ref> As the initially na\u00efve protagonist eventually comes to a mature conclusion\u2014however noncommittal\u2014the novella is a ''[[bildungsroman]]'', if not a very serious one.<ref name = aldridge251254/><ref>Waldinger (1987), p. 20</ref>\n\n=== Garden motif ===\nGardens are thought by many critics to play a critical symbolic role in ''Candide''. The first location commonly identified as a garden is the castle of the Baron, from which Candide and Cun\u00e9gonde are evicted much in the same fashion as [[Adam and Eve]] are evicted from the [[Garden of Eden]] in the [[Book of Genesis]]. Cyclically, the main characters of ''Candide'' conclude the novel in a garden of their own making, one which might represent celestial paradise. The third most prominent \"garden\" is [[El Dorado]], which may be a false Eden.<ref>''Readings on Candide'' (2001), p. 92</ref> Other possibly symbolic gardens include the [[Jesuit]] pavilion, the garden of Pococurante, Cacambo's garden, and the Turk's garden.<ref name=bottiglia727>Bottiglia (1951), pp. 727, 731</ref>\n\nThese gardens are probably references to the Garden of Eden, but it has also been proposed, by Bottiglia, for example, that the gardens refer also to the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'', and that Candide's conclusion to cultivate \"his garden\" symbolises Voltaire's great support for this endeavour. Candide and his companions, as they find themselves at the end of the novella, are in a very similar position to Voltaire's tightly knit philosophical circle which supported the {{lang|fr|Encyclop\u00e9die}}: the main characters of ''Candide'' live in seclusion to \"cultivate [their] garden\", just as Voltaire suggested his colleagues leave society to write. In addition, there is evidence in the [[epistle|epistolary]] correspondence of Voltaire that he had elsewhere used the metaphor of gardening to describe writing the {{lang|fr|Encyclop\u00e9die}}.<ref name=bottiglia727/> Another interpretative possibility is that Candide cultivating \"his garden\" suggests his engaging in only necessary occupations, such as feeding oneself and fighting boredom. This is analogous to Voltaire's own view on gardening: he was himself a gardener at his estates in [[Les D\u00e9lices]] and [[Ferney]], and he often wrote in his correspondence that gardening was an important pastime of his own, it being an extraordinarily effective way to keep busy.<ref>Davidson (2005), p. 55</ref><ref name=scherr>Scherr (1993)</ref><ref>Aldridge (1975), p. 258</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n\n=== Optimism ===\n''Candide'' satirises various philosophical and religious theories that Voltaire had previously criticised. Primary among these is [[Gottfried Leibniz#Theodicy and optimism|Leibnizian optimism]] (sometimes called ''Panglossianism'' after its fictional proponent), which Voltaire ridicules with descriptions of seemingly endless calamity.<ref name=davidson54>Davidson (2005), p. 54</ref> Voltaire demonstrates a variety of irredeemable evils in the world, leading many critics to contend that Voltaire's treatment of evil\u2014specifically the theological problem of\nits existence\u2014is the focus of the work.<ref>''Readings on Candide'' (2001), p. 121</ref> Heavily referenced in the text are the Lisbon earthquake, disease, and the sinking of ships in storms. Also, war, thievery, and murder\u2014evils of human design\u2014are explored as extensively in ''Candide'' as are environmental ills. Bottiglia notes Voltaire is \"comprehensive\" in his enumeration of the world's evils. He is unrelenting in attacking Leibnizian optimism.<ref>Bottiglia (1951), p. 720</ref>\n\nFundamental to Voltaire's attack is Candide's tutor Pangloss, a self-proclaimed follower of Leibniz and a teacher of his doctrine. Ridicule of Pangloss's theories thus ridicules Leibniz himself, and Pangloss's reasoning is silly at best. For example, Pangloss's first teachings of the narrative absurdly mix up cause and effect:\n\n{{quote|text={{lang|fr|Il est d\u00e9montr\u00e9, disait-il, que les choses ne peuvent \u00eatre autrement; car tout \u00e9tant fait pour une fin, tout est n\u00e9cessairement pour la meilleure fin. Remarquez bien que les nez ont \u00e9t\u00e9 faits pour porter des lunettes; aussi avons-nous des lunettes.}}}}\n\n{{quote|text=It is demonstrable that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for as all things have been created for some end, they must necessarily be created for the best end. Observe, for instance, the nose is formed for spectacles, therefore we wear spectacles.<ref>Smollett (2008), Ch. 1</ref>}}\n\nFollowing such flawed reasoning even more doggedly than Candide, Pangloss defends optimism. Whatever their horrendous fortune, Pangloss reiterates \"all is for the best\" (\"{{lang|fr|Tout est pour le mieux}}\") and proceeds to \"justify\" the evil event's occurrence. A characteristic example of such [[theodicy]] is found in Pangloss's explanation of why it is good that [[syphilis]] exists:\n\n{{quote|text={{lang|fr|c'\u00e9tait une chose indispensable dans le meilleur des mondes, un ingr\u00e9dient n\u00e9cessaire; car si Colomb n'avait pas attrap\u00e9 dans une \u00eele de l'Am\u00e9rique cette maladie qui empoisonne la source de la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, qui souvent m\u00eame emp\u00eache la g\u00e9n\u00e9ration, et qui est \u00e9videmment l'oppos\u00e9 du grand but de la nature, nous n'aurions ni le chocolat ni la cochenille;}}}}\n\n{{quote|text=it was a thing unavoidable, a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if Columbus had not caught in an island in America this disease, which contaminates the source of generation, and frequently impedes propagation itself, and is evidently opposed to the great end of nature, we should have had neither chocolate nor cochineal.<ref name=\"Smollett 2008, Ch. 4\" />}}\n\nCandide, the impressionable and incompetent student of Pangloss, often tries to justify evil, fails, invokes his mentor and eventually despairs. It is by these failures that Candide is painfully cured (as Voltaire would see it) of his optimism.\n\nThis critique of Voltaire's seems to be directed almost exclusively at Leibnizian optimism. ''Candide'' does not ridicule Voltaire's contemporary [[Alexander Pope]], a later optimist of slightly different convictions. ''Candide'' does not discuss Pope's optimistic principle that \"all is right\", but Leibniz's that states, \"this is the best of all possible worlds\". However subtle the difference between the two, ''Candide'' is unambiguous as to which is its subject. Some critics conjecture that Voltaire meant to spare Pope this ridicule out of respect, although Voltaire's ''Po\u00e8me'' may have been written as a more direct response to Pope's theories. This work is similar to ''Candide'' in subject matter, but very different from it in style: the ''Po\u00e8me'' embodies a more serious philosophical argument than ''Candide''.<ref name=\"aldridge 251\u2013254, 361\">Aldridge (1975), pp. 251\u2013254, 361</ref><!--Temmer, I think, disagrees with this. However, he is in the minority, and is not primarily a Voltaire scholar\u2026 see:\n\nVoltaire and Samuel Beckett: A Comparative Study of Candide and The\nUnnamable By: Ludlow, Gregory; Comparatist: Journal of the Southern\nComparative Literature Association, 1978; 2: 1\u201310. (journal article)\nISSN: 0195-7678 Sequence number: 1979-2-1786 Accession number:\n1979201786 -->\n\n=== Conclusion ===\nThe conclusion of the novel, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor's optimism, leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead. This element of ''Candide'' has been written about voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious.<ref>Leister (1985), p. 29</ref>\n\nVoltaire develops no formal, systematic philosophy for the characters to adopt.<ref name=bottiglia2324>Bottiglia (1951), pp. 723\u2013724</ref> The conclusion of the novel may be thought of not as a philosophical alternative to optimism, but as a prescribed practical outlook (though {{em|what}} it prescribes is in dispute). Many critics have concluded that one minor character or another is portrayed as having the right philosophy. For instance, a number believe that Martin is treated sympathetically, and that his character holds Voltaire's ideal philosophy\u2014pessimism. Others disagree, citing Voltaire's negative descriptions of Martin's principles and the conclusion of the work in which Martin plays little part.<ref name=bottiglia726>Bottiglia (1951), p. 726</ref>\n\nWithin debates attempting to decipher the conclusion of ''Candide'' lies another primary ''Candide'' debate. This one concerns the degree to which Voltaire was advocating a pessimistic philosophy, by which Candide and his companions give up hope for a better world. Critics argue that the group's reclusion on the farm signifies Candide and his companions' loss of hope for the rest of the human race. This view is to be compared to a reading that presents Voltaire as advocating a [[meliorism|melioristic]] philosophy and a precept committing the travellers to improving the world through metaphorical gardening. This debate, and others, focuses on the question of whether or not Voltaire was prescribing passive retreat from society, or active industrious contribution to it.<ref>Leister (1985), p. 26</ref>\n\n=== Inside vs. outside interpretations ===\nSeparate from the debate about the text's conclusion is the \"inside/outside\" controversy. This argument centers on the matter of whether or not Voltaire was actually prescribing anything. Roy Wolper, professor emeritus of English, argues in a revolutionary 1969 paper that ''Candide'' does not necessarily speak for its author; that the work should be viewed as a narrative independent of Voltaire's history; and that its message is entirely (or mostly) {{em|inside}} it. This point of view, the \"inside\", specifically rejects attempts to find Voltaire's \"voice\" in the many characters of ''Candide'' and his other works. Indeed, writers have seen Voltaire as speaking through at least Candide, Martin, and the Turk. Wolper argues that ''Candide'' should be read with a minimum of speculation as to its meaning in Voltaire's personal life. His article ushered in a new era of Voltaire studies, causing many scholars to look at the novel differently.<ref>Braun, Sturzer, Meyer (1988)</ref><ref>Wolper (1969), pp. 265\u2013277</ref> <!-- this may be usable for beefing up the \"inside\" perspective -->\n\nCritics such as Lester Crocker, Henry Stavan, and Vivienne Mylne find too many similarities between ''Candide''{{'}}s point of view and that of Voltaire to accept the \"inside\" view; they support the \"outside\" interpretation. They believe that Candide's final decision is the same as Voltaire's, and see a strong connection between the development of the protagonist and his author.<ref name=bottiglia719>Bottiglia (1951), pp. 719\u2013720</ref> Some scholars who support the \"outside\" view also believe that the isolationist philosophy of the Old Turk closely mirrors that of Voltaire.

Of course Voltaire denied his authorship: \"people must have lost their senses,\" he wrote to a friendly pastor in Geneva, \"to attribute to me that pack of nonsense. I have, thank God, better occupations.\" But France was unanimous: no other man could have written ''Candide''. Here was that deceptively simple, smoothly flowing, lightly prancing, impishly ironic prose that only he could write; here and there a little obscenity, a little scatology; everywhere a playful, darting, lethal irreverence; if the style is the man, this had to be Voltaire.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Civilization Volume 9:The Age of Voltaire|author=Will Durant|publisher=Simon&Schuster|pages=724|year=1965}}</ref>}}<!--END OF NOTE-->}}\n\nImmediately after publication, the work and its author were denounced by both secular and religious authorities, because the book openly derides government and church alike. It was because of such polemics that Omer-Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Joly de Fleury, who was [[Advocate General]] to the Parisian [[parliament]] when ''Candide'' was published, found parts of ''Candide'' to be \"contrary to religion and morals\".<ref name=mason1315/>\n\nDespite much official indictment, soon after its publication, ''Candide''{{'}}s irreverent prose was being quoted. \"Let us eat a Jesuit\", for instance, became a popular phrase for its reference to a humorous passage in ''Candide''.<ref name=mason3>Mason (1992), ch. 3</ref> By the end of February 1759, the [[Grand Council of Geneva]] and the administrators of Paris had banned ''Candide''.<ref name = williams123/> ''Candide'' nevertheless succeeded in selling twenty thousand to thirty thousand copies by the end of the year in over twenty editions, making it a best seller. The Duke de La Valli\u00e8re speculated near the end of January 1759 that ''Candide'' might have been the fastest-selling book ever.<ref name=mason1315>Mason (1992), pp. 13\u201315</ref> In 1762, ''Candide'' was listed in the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'', the Roman Catholic Church's list of prohibited books.<ref name=williams123>Williams (1997), pp. 1\u20133</ref>\n\nBannings of ''Candide'' lasted into the twentieth century in the United States, where it has long been considered a seminal work of Western literature. At least once, ''Candide'' was temporarily barred from entering America: in February 1929, a US [[customs]] official in [[Boston]] prevented a number of copies of the book, deemed \"obscene\",<ref name=haight>Haight (1970), p. 33</ref> from reaching a [[Harvard University]] French class. ''Candide'' was admitted in August of the same year; however by that time the class was over.<ref name=haight/> In an interview soon after ''Candide''{{'}}s detention, the official who confiscated the book explained the office's decision to ban it, \"But about 'Candide,' I'll tell you. For years we've been letting that book get by. There were so many different editions, all sizes and kinds, some illustrated and some plain, that we figured the book must be all right. Then one of us happened to read it.

According to Bottiglia, \"The physical size of ''Candide'', as well as Voltaire's attitude toward his fiction, precludes the achievement of artistic dimension through plenitude, autonomous '3D' vitality, emotional resonance, or poetic exaltation. ''Candide'', then, cannot in quantity or quality, measure up to the supreme classics.\"<ref name=bott247>Bottiglia (1959), p. 247</ref> Bottiglia instead calls it a miniature classic, though others are more forgiving of its size.<ref name=aldridge260/><ref name=bott247/> As the only work of Voltaire which has remained popular up to the present day,<ref name=mason2>Mason (1992), ch. 2</ref> ''Candide'' is listed in [[Harold Bloom]]'s ''[[The Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages]]''. It is included in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] collection ''[[Great Books of the Western World]]''.<ref>Britannica (2008)</ref> ''Candide'' has influenced modern writers of [[black comedy|black humour]] such as [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line|C\u00e9line]], [[Joseph Heller]], [[John Barth]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], and [[Terry Southern]]. Its parody and picaresque methods have become favourites of black humorists.<ref>''Readings on Candide'' (2001), pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\n[[Charles Brockden Brown]], an early American novelist, may have been directly affected by Voltaire, whose work he knew well. Mark Kamrath, professor of English, describes the strength of the connection between ''Candide'' and ''[[Edgar Huntly; or, Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker]]'' (1799): \"An unusually large number of parallels...crop up in the two novels, particularly in terms of characters and plot.\" For instance, the protagonists of both novels are romantically involved with a recently orphaned young woman. Furthermore, in both works the brothers of the female lovers are Jesuits, and each is murdered (although under different circumstances).<ref name=kamrath>Kamrath (1991), pp. 5\u201314</ref> Some twentieth-century novels that may have been influenced by ''Candide'' are [[dystopia]]n [[science-fiction]] works. [[Armand Mattelart]], a French critic, sees ''Candide'' in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', three canonical works of the genre. Specifically, Mattelart writes that in each of these works, there exist references to ''Candide''{{'}}s popularisation of the phrase \"the best of all possible worlds\". He cites as evidence, for example, that the French version of ''Brave New World'' was entitled {{lang|fr|Le Meilleur des mondes}} ({{literal translation|\"The best of worlds\"|lk=on}}).<ref name=monty5>Monty (2006), p. 5</ref>\n\nReaders of ''Candide'' often compare it with certain works of the modern genre the [[Theatre of the Absurd]]. Haydn Mason, a Voltaire scholar, sees in ''Candide'' a few similarities to this brand of literature. For instance, he notes commonalities of ''Candide'' and ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' (1952). In both of these works, and in a similar manner, friendship provides emotional support for characters when they are confronted with harshness of their existences.<ref name=mason3337>Mason (1992), pp. 33, 37</ref> However, Mason qualifies, \"the {{lang|fr|conte}} must not be seen as a forerunner of the 'absurd' in modern fiction. Candide's world has many ridiculous and meaningless elements, but human beings are not totally deprived of the ability to make sense out of it.\"<ref name=mason98>Mason (1992), p. 98</ref> [[John Pilling]], biographer of Beckett, does state that ''Candide'' was an early and powerful influence on Beckett's thinking.<ref name=monty151>Monty (2006), p. 151</ref><!--if necessary, this source includes another, perhaps stronger, example of an intertexutal reference by Beckett to ''Candide''--> [[Rosa Luxemburg]], in the aftermath of the First World War, remarked upon re-reading ''Candide'': \"Before the war, I would have thought this wicked compilation of all human misery a caricature.

''Part II'' has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of ''Candide'', but is almost certainly [[apocrypha]]l.<ref name=\"astbury503\" /> In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of ''Candide'' or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.<ref name=mason1315/>\n[[File:Leonard Bernstein NYWTS 1955.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Leonard Bernstein]] in 1955]]\n\nThe operetta ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]'' was originally conceived by playwright [[Lillian Hellman]], as a play with incidental music.

A number of theories on the matter have been proposed. Proponents of one say that {{lang|it|Candido}} is very similar to ''Candide'', only with a happy ending; supporters of another claim that Voltaire provided Sciascia with only a starting point from which to work, that the two books are quite distinct.<ref name=morrison59>Morrison (2002), p. 59</ref><ref>Burns (2000), p. 992</ref>\n\nThe BBC produced a television adaptation in 1973, with [[Ian Ogilvy]] as Candide, [[Emrys James]] as Dr. Pangloss, and [[Frank Finlay]] as Voltaire himself, acting as the narrator.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceFilmWorks/150024120 |title=Candide |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=Collections Search |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=23 July 2018 }}</ref>\n\n[[Nedim G\u00fcrsel]] wrote his 2001 novel ''Le voyage de Candide \u00e0 Istanbul'' about a minor passage in ''Candide'' during which its protagonist meets [[Ahmed III]], the deposed [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[sultan]].

Anderson]], published two [[sequel]]s \u2013 ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' (2006) and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]'' (2007) \u2013 based in part on notes left behind by Frank Herbert for what he referred to as ''Dune 7'', his own planned seventh novel in the ''Dune'' series.\n\n==Plot==\nThe situation is desperate for the Bene Gesserit as they find themselves the targets of the Honored Matres, whose conquest of the Old Empire is almost complete. The Matres are seeking to assimilate the technology and developed methods of the Bene Gesserit and exterminate the Sisterhood itself. Now in command of the Bene Gesserit, Mother Superior [[Darwi Odrade]] continues to develop her drastic, secret plan to overcome the Honored Matres. The Bene Gesserit are also terraforming the planet [[Chapterhouse (Dune)|Chapterhouse]] to accommodate the all-important [[Sandworm (Dune)|sandworms]], whose native planet [[Arrakis|Dune]] had been destroyed by the Matres. [[Sheeana]], in charge of the project, expects sandworms to appear soon. The Honored Matres have also destroyed the entire [[Bene Tleilax]] civilization, with Tleilaxu Master [[Scytale (Dune)|Scytale]] the only one of his kind left alive. In Bene Gesserit captivity, Scytale possesses the Tleilaxu secret of [[ghola]] production, which he has reluctantly traded for the Sisterhood's protection. The first ghola produced is that of their recently deceased military genius, [[Miles Teg]]. The Bene Gesserit have two other prisoners on Chapterhouse: the latest [[Duncan Idaho]] ghola, and former Honored Matre [[Murbella]], whom they have accepted as a novice despite their suspicion that she intends to escape back to the Honored Matres.\n\n[[Lampadas]], a center for Bene Gesserit education, has been destroyed by the Honored Matres. The planet's Chancellor, [[Reverend Mother (Dune)|Reverend Mother]] [[Lucilla (Dune)|Lucilla]], manages to escape carrying the shared-minds of millions of Reverend Mothers. Lucilla is forced to land on [[Giedi Prime|Gammu]] where she seeks refuge with an underground group of [[Jews]]. The Rabbi gives Lucilla sanctuary, but to save his organization he must deliver her to the Matres. Before doing so, he reveals [[Rebecca (Dune)|Rebecca]], a \"wild\" Reverend Mother who has gained her [[Other Memory]] without Bene Gesserit training. Lucilla shares minds with Rebecca, who promises to take the memories of Lampadas safely back to the Sisterhood. Lucilla is then \"betrayed\", and taken before the [[Great Honored Matre]] [[Dama (Dune)|Dama]], who tries to persuade her to join the Honored Matres, preserving her life in exchange for Bene Gesserit secrets. Lucilla refuses, and Dama ultimately kills her.\n\nBack on Chapterhouse, Odrade confronts Duncan and forces him to admit that he is a [[Mentat]], proving that he retains the memories of his many ghola lives. He does not reveal his mysterious visions of two people. Meanwhile, Murbella collapses under the pressure of Bene Gesserit training, giving in to \"word weapons\" that the Bene Gesserit had planted to undermine her earlier Honored Matre identity. Murbella realizes that she wants to be Bene Gesserit. Odrade believes that the Bene Gesserit made a mistake in fearing emotion, and that in order to evolve, the Bene Gesserit must learn to accept emotions. Odrade permits Duncan to watch Murbella undergo the [[spice agony]], making him the first man ever to do so. Murbella survives the ordeal and becomes a Reverend Mother.\n\nOdrade then confronts Sheeana, discovering that Duncan and Sheeana have been allied together for some time. Sheeana does not reveal that they have been considering the option of reawakening Teg's memory through [[Imprinting (psychology)|Imprinting]], nor does Odrade discover that Sheeana has the keys to Duncan's no-ship prison. Odrade continues molding Scytale, with Sheeana showing him a baby sandworm, the Bene Gesserit's own long term supply of spice, and destroying Scytale's main bargaining card. Finally, Teg is awakened by Sheeana using imprinting techniques. Odrade appoints him again as [[Bashar (Dune)|Bashar]] of the military forces of the Sisterhood for the assault on the Honored Matres.\n\nOdrade next calls a meeting of all the Bene Gesserit, announcing her plan to attack the Honored Matres. She tells them that this attack will be led by Teg. She also announces candidates to succeed her as Mother Superior; she will share her memories with Murbella and Sheeana before she leaves. Odrade then goes to meet the Great Honored Matre. Under cover of Odrade's diplomacy, the Bene Gesserit forces under Teg attack Gammu with tremendous force. Teg uses his secret ability to see no-ships to secure control of the system. Survivors of the attack flee to Junction, and Teg follows them there and carries all with him. Victory for the Bene Gesserit seems inevitable. In the midst of this battle, the Jews (including Rebecca with her precious memories) take refuge with the Bene Gesserit fleet.\n\n[[Logno]] \u2014 chief advisor to Dama \u2014 assassinates Dama with poison and assumes control of the Honored Matres. Her first act surprises Odrade greatly. Too late, Odrade and Teg realize they have fallen into a trap, and the Honored Matres use a mysterious weapon to turn defeat into victory, as well as capturing Odrade. Murbella saves as much of the Bene Gesserit force as she can and they begin to withdraw to Chapterhouse. Odrade, however, had planned for the possible failure of the Bene Gesserit attack and left Murbella instructions for a last desperate gamble. Murbella pilots a small craft down to the surface, announcing herself as an Honored Matre who, in the confusion, has managed to escape the Bene Gesserit with all their secrets. She arrives on the planet and is taken to the Great Honored Matre. Unable to control her anger, Logno attacks but is killed by Murbella. Awed by her physical prowess, the remaining Honored Matres are forced to accept her as their new leader. Odrade is also killed in the melee and Murbella shares with Odrade to absorb her newest memories, as they had already shared prior to the battle.\n\nMurbella's ascension to leadership is not accepted as victory by all the Bene Gesserit. Some flee Chapterhouse, notably Sheeana, who has a vision of her own, and arranges to have some of the new worms that have emerged in the Chapterhouse desert brought aboard the no-ship. Sheeana is joined by Duncan. The two escape in the giant no-ship, with Scytale, Teg and the Jews. Murbella recognizes their plan at the last minute, but is powerless to stop them. Watching this escape with interest are [[Daniel and Marty]], the observers of whom Duncan had been having visions. The story ends on a cliffhanger with several questions left unanswered regarding the merging of the Honored Matres and Bene Gesserit, the fates of those on the escaped no-ship (including the role of Scytale, the development of Idaho and Teg, and the role of the Jews), the identity of the god-like characters in the book's final chapter and the ultimate mystery of what chased the Honored Matres back into the Old Empire.\n\n==Reception==\n''Chapterhouse: Dune'' debuted at #5 and rose to #2 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].<ref name=NYTBS/> Gerald Jonas of ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that \"Against all odds, the universe of ''Dune'' keeps getting richer in texture, more challenging in its moral dilemmas.\"<ref name=\"NYT 1985\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/06/16/books/science-fiction.html?scp=3&sq=chapterhouse%20dune&st=cse|title=Science Fiction (Review)|last=Jonas|first=Gerald|date=June 16, 1985|work=The New York Times|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Sequels==\nTwo decades after Frank Herbert's death, his son [[Brian Herbert]], along with [[Kevin J.

Modern computer buses can use both [[parallel communication|parallel]] and [[bit serial]] connections, and can be wired in either a [[multidrop]] (electrical parallel) or [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] topology, or connected by switched hubs, as in the case of [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].\n\n==Background and nomenclature==\nComputer systems generally consist of three main parts: the [[central processing unit]] (CPU) that processes data, [[main memory|memory]] that holds the programs and data to be processed, and I/O (input/output) devices as [[peripherals]] that communicate with the outside world. An early computer might contain a hand-wired CPU of [[vacuum tube]]s, a [[magnetic drum]] for main memory, and a [[punch tape]] and [[Printer (computing)|printer]] for reading and writing data respectively. A modern system might have a [[multi-core CPU]], [[DDR4 SDRAM]] for memory, a [[solid-state drive]] for [[secondary storage]], a [[graphics card]] and [[LCD]] as a display system, a [[computer mouse|mouse]] and [[computer keyboard|keyboard]] for interaction, and a [[Wi-Fi]] connection for [[computer network|networking]]. In both examples, computer buses of one form or another move data between all of these devices.\n\nIn most traditional [[computer architecture]]s, the CPU and main memory tend to be tightly coupled. A [[microprocessor]] conventionally is a single chip which has a number of electrical connections on its pins that can be used to select an [[Memory address|\"address\"]] in the main memory and another set of pins to read and write the data stored at that location. In most cases, the CPU and memory share signalling characteristics and operate in [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchrony]]. The bus connecting the CPU and memory is one of the defining characteristics of the system, and often referred to simply as the [[system bus]].\n\nIt is possible to allow peripherals to communicate with memory in the same fashion, attaching adaptors in the form of [[expansion card]]s directly to the system bus. This is commonly accomplished through some sort of standardized electrical connector, several of these forming the [[expansion bus]] or [[local bus]]. However, as the performance differences between the CPU and peripherals varies widely, some solution is generally needed to ensure that peripherals do not slow overall system performance. Many CPUs feature a second set of pins similar to those for communicating with memory, but able to operate at very different speeds and using different protocols. Others use smart controllers to place the data directly in memory, a concept known as [[direct memory access]]. Most modern systems combine both solutions, where appropriate.\n\nAs the number of potential peripherals grew, using an expansion card for every peripheral became increasingly untenable. This has led to the introduction of bus systems designed specifically to support multiple peripherals. Common examples are the [[SATA]] ports in modern computers, which allow a number of hard drives to be connected without the need for a card. However, these high-performance systems are generally too expensive to implement in low-end devices, like a mouse. This has led to the parallel development of a number of low-performance bus systems for these solutions, the most common example being the standardized '''[[Universal Serial Bus]] (USB).''' All such examples may be referred to as [[peripheral bus]]es, although this terminology is not universal.\n\nIn modern systems the performance difference between the CPU and main memory has grown so great that increasing amounts of high-speed memory is built directly into the CPU, known as a [[CPU cache|cache]]. In such systems, CPUs communicate using high-performance buses that operate at speeds much greater than memory, and communicate with memory using protocols similar to those used solely for peripherals in the past. These system buses are also used to communicate with most (or all) other peripherals, through adaptors, which in turn talk to other peripherals and controllers. Such systems are architecturally more similar to [[Distributed computing|multicomputers]], communicating over a bus rather than a network. In these cases, expansion buses are entirely separate and no longer share any architecture with their host CPU (and may in fact support many different CPUs, as is the case with [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]]). What would have formerly been a system bus is now often known as a [[front-side bus]].\n\nGiven these changes, the classical terms \"system\", \"expansion\" and \"peripheral\" no longer have the same connotations. Other common categorization systems are based on the bus's primary role, connecting devices internally or externally, PCI vs. [[SCSI]] for instance. However, many common modern bus systems can be used for both; [[SATA]] and the associated [[eSATA]] are one example of a system that would formerly be described as internal, while certain automotive applications use the primarily external [[IEEE 1394]] in a fashion more similar to a system bus. Other examples, like [[InfiniBand]] and [[I\u00b2C]] were designed from the start to be used both internally and externally.\n\n===Internal buses===\nThe internal bus, also known as internal data bus, memory bus, system bus or Front-Side-Bus, connects all the internal components of a computer, such as CPU and memory, to the motherboard. Internal data buses are also referred to as a local bus, because they are intended to connect to local devices. This bus is typically rather quick and is independent of the rest of the computer operations.\n\n===External buses===\nThe external bus, or [[expansion bus]], is made up of the electronic pathways that connect the different external devices, such as printer etc., to the computer.\n\n==Implementation details==\nBuses can be [[parallel communications|parallel bus]]es, which carry [[computer word|data words]] in parallel on multiple wires, or [[serial bus]]es, which carry data in bit-serial form. The addition of extra power and control connections, [[differential signaling|differential driver]]s, and data connections in each direction usually means that most serial buses have more conductors than the minimum of one used in [[1-Wire]] and [[UNI/O]]. As data rates increase, the problems of [[timing skew]], power consumption, electromagnetic interference and [[crosstalk]] across parallel buses become more and more difficult to circumvent. One partial solution to this problem has been to [[double pumped|double pump]] the bus. Often, a serial bus can be operated at higher overall data rates than a parallel bus, despite having fewer electrical connections, because a serial bus inherently has no timing skew or crosstalk. [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[FireWire]], and [[Serial ATA]] are examples of this. [[Multidrop]] connections do not work well for fast serial buses, so most modern serial buses use [[Daisy chain (information technology)#Computer hardware|daisy-chain]] or hub designs.\n\n[[computer network|Network]] connections such as [[Ethernet]] are not generally regarded as buses, although the difference is largely conceptual rather than practical. An attribute generally used to characterize a bus is that power is provided by the bus for the connected hardware. This emphasizes the [[busbar]] origins of bus architecture as supplying switched or distributed power. This excludes, as buses, schemes such as serial [[RS-232]], parallel [[Centronics]], [[IEEE 1284]] interfaces and Ethernet, since these devices also needed separate power supplies. [[Universal Serial Bus]] devices may use the bus supplied power, but often use a separate power source. This distinction is exemplified by a [[Plain old telephone service|telephone]] system with a connected [[modem]], where the [[RJ11]] connection and associated modulated signalling scheme is not considered a bus, and is analogous to an [[Ethernet]] connection. A phone line connection scheme is not considered to be a bus with respect to signals, but the [[telephone exchange|Central Office]] uses buses with [[cross-bar switch]]es for connections between phones.\n\nHowever, this distinction{{mdashb}}that power is provided by the bus{{mdashb}}is not the case in many [[avionics|avionic systems]], where data connections such as [[ARINC 429]], [[ARINC 629]], [[MIL-STD-1553B]] (STANAG 3838), and EFABus ([[STANAG 3910]]) are commonly referred to as \u201cdata buses\u201d or, sometimes, \"databuses\". Such [[avionics#Aircraft networks|avionic data buses]] are usually characterized by having several equipments or [[Line-replaceable unit|Line Replaceable Items/Units]] (LRI/LRUs) connected to a common, shared [[Media (communication)|media]]. They may, as with ARINC 429, be [[Simplex communication|simplex]], i.e. have a single source LRI/LRU or, as with ARINC 629, MIL-STD-1553B, and STANAG 3910, be [[Duplex (telecommunications)|duplex]], allow all the connected LRI/LRUs to act, at different times ([[half duplex]]), as transmitters and receivers of data.<ref name = \"ASSC 2003\">Avionic Systems Standardisation Committee, ''Guide to Digital Interface Standards For Military Avionic Applications'', ASSC/110/6/2, Issue 2, September 2003</ref>\n\n==History==\nOver time, several groups of people worked on various computer bus standards, including the IEEE Bus Architecture Standards Committee (BASC), the IEEE \"Superbus\" study group, the open microprocessor initiative (OMI), the open microsystems initiative (OMI), the \"Gang of Nine\" that developed [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]], etc.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n===First generation===\nEarly [[computer]] buses were bundles of wire that attached [[computer memory]] and peripherals. Anecdotally termed the \"''digit trunk''\",<ref>See the early Australian [[CSIRAC]] computer</ref> they were named after electrical power buses, or [[busbar]]s. Almost always, there was one bus for memory, and one or more separate buses for peripherals. These were accessed by separate instructions, with completely different timings and protocols.\n\nOne of the first complications was the use of [[interrupt]]s. Early computer programs performed [[Input/output|I/O]] by [[Busy waiting|waiting in a loop]] for the peripheral to become ready. This was a waste of time for programs that had other tasks to do. Also, if the program attempted to perform those other tasks, it might take too long for the program to check again, resulting in loss of data. Engineers thus arranged for the peripherals to interrupt the CPU. The interrupts had to be prioritized, because the CPU can only execute code for one peripheral at a time, and some devices are more time-critical than others.\n\nHigh-end systems introduced the idea of [[Channel I/O|channel controller]]s, which were essentially small computers dedicated to handling the input and output of a given bus. [[IBM]] introduced these on the [[IBM 709]] in 1958, and they became a common feature of their platforms. Other high-performance vendors like [[Control Data Corporation]] implemented similar designs. Generally, the channel controllers would do their best to run all of the bus operations internally, moving data when the CPU was known to be busy elsewhere if possible, and only using interrupts when necessary. This greatly reduced CPU load, and provided better overall system performance.\n\n[[Image:Computer system bus.svg|thumb|right|400px |Single [[system bus]] ]]\nTo provide modularity, memory and I/O buses can be combined into a unified [[system bus]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The essentials of computer organization and architecture |author1=Linda Null |author2=Julia Lobur |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-7637-3769-6 |edition=2nd |pages=33,179\u2013181 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QGPHAl9GE-IC&pg=PA33 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117151308/https://books.google.com/books?id=QGPHAl9GE-IC&pg=PA33 |archivedate=2018-01-17 |df= }}</ref> In this case, a single mechanical and electrical system can be used to connect together many of the system components, or in some cases, all of them.\n\nLater computer programs began to share memory common to several CPUs. Access to this memory bus had to be prioritized, as well. The simple way to prioritize interrupts or bus access was with a [[Daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]]. In this case signals will naturally flow through the bus in physical or logical order, eliminating the need for complex scheduling.\n\n===Minis and micros===\n[[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) further reduced cost for mass-produced [[minicomputer]]s, and [[Memory-mapped I/O|mapped peripherals]] into the memory bus, so that the input and output devices appeared to be memory locations.  This was implemented in the [[Unibus]] of the [[PDP-11]] around 1969.<ref>{{cite journal |title= A New Architecture for Mini-Computers\u2014The DEC PDP-11 |author1= C. Gordon Bell |author2= R.

Memory and other devices would be added to the bus using the same address and data pins as the CPU itself used, connected in parallel.  Communication was controlled by the CPU, which read and wrote data from the devices as if they are blocks of memory, using the same instructions, all timed by a central clock controlling the speed of the CPU. Still, devices [[interrupt]]ed the CPU by signaling on separate CPU pins.\n\nFor instance, a [[disk drive]] controller would signal the CPU that new data was ready to be read, at which point the CPU would move the data by reading the \"memory location\" that corresponded to the disk drive. Almost all early microcomputers were built in this fashion, starting with the [[S-100 bus]] in the [[Altair 8800]] computer system.\n\nIn some instances, most notably in the [[IBM PC]], although similar physical architecture can be employed, instructions to access peripherals (<code>in</code> and <code>out</code>) and memory (<code>mov</code> and others) have not been made uniform at all, and still generate distinct CPU signals, that could be used to implement a separate I/O bus.\n\nThese simple bus systems had a serious drawback when used for general-purpose computers.  All the equipment on the bus had to talk at the same speed, as it shared a single clock.\n\nIncreasing the speed of the CPU becomes harder, because the speed of all the devices must increase as well. When it is not practical or economical to have all devices as fast as the CPU, the CPU must either enter a [[wait state]], or work at a slower clock frequency temporarily,<ref name=\"bray-aug\">{{cite book|last= Bray|first= Andrew C.|author2= Dickens, Adrian C.|author3= Holmes, Mark A.|title= The Advanced User Guide for the BBC Microcomputer|url= http://www.nvg.org/bbc/doc/BBCAdvancedUserGuide-PDF.zip|format= zipped PDF|accessdate= 2008-03-28|year= 1983|publisher= Cambridge Microcomputer Centre|location= Cambridge, UK|isbn= 0-946827-00-1|pages= 442\u2013443|chapter= 28.

While acceptable in [[embedded systems]], this problem was not tolerated for long in general-purpose, user-expandable computers.\n\nSuch bus systems are also difficult to configure when constructed from common off-the-shelf equipment.  Typically each added [[expansion card]] requires many [[Jumper (computing)|jumpers]] in order to set memory addresses, I/O addresses, interrupt priorities, and interrupt numbers.\n\n===Second generation===\n\"Second generation\" bus systems like [[NuBus]] addressed some of these problems. They typically separated the computer into two \"worlds\", the CPU and memory on one side, and the various devices on the other. A ''bus controller'' accepted data from the CPU side to be moved to the peripherals side, thus shifting the communications protocol burden from the CPU itself. This allowed the CPU and memory side to evolve separately from the device bus, or just \"bus\". Devices on the bus could talk to each other with no CPU intervention. This led to much better \"real world\" performance, but also required the cards to be much more complex. These buses also often addressed speed issues by being \"bigger\" in terms of the size of the data path, moving from 8-bit [[parallel bus]]es in the first generation, to 16 or 32-bit in the second, as well as adding software setup (now standardised as [[Plug-n-play]]) to supplant or replace the jumpers.\n\nHowever these newer systems shared one quality with their earlier cousins, in that everyone on the bus had to talk at the same speed. While the CPU was now isolated and could increase speed, CPUs and memory continued to increase in speed much faster than the buses they talked to. The result was that the bus speeds were now very much slower than what a modern system needed, and the machines were left starved for data. A particularly common example of this problem was that [[video card]]s quickly outran even the newer bus systems like [[PCI Local Bus|PCI]], and computers began to include [[Accelerated Graphics Port|AGP]] just to drive the video card. By 2004 AGP was outgrown again by high-end video cards and other peripherals and has been replaced by the new [[PCI Express]] bus.\n\nAn increasing number of external devices started employing their own bus systems as well. When disk drives were first introduced, they would be added to the machine with a card plugged into the bus, which is why computers have so many slots on the bus. But through the 1980s and 1990s, new systems like [[SCSI]] and [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] were introduced to serve this need, leaving most slots in modern systems empty. Today there are likely to be about five different buses in the typical machine, supporting various devices.\n\n===Third generation===\n{{See also|Bus network}}\n\n\"Third generation\" buses have been emerging into the market since about 2001, including [[HyperTransport]] and [[InfiniBand]]. They also tend to be very flexible in terms of their physical connections, allowing them to be used both as internal buses, as well as connecting different machines together. This can lead to complex problems when trying to service different requests, so much of the work on these systems concerns software design, as opposed to the hardware itself. In general, these third generation buses tend to look more like a [[Computer network|network]] than the original concept of a bus, with a higher protocol overhead needed than early systems, while also allowing multiple devices to use the bus at once.\n\nBuses such as [[Wishbone (computer bus)|Wishbone]] have been developed by the [[open source hardware]] movement in an attempt to further remove legal and patent constraints from computer design.\n\n==Examples of internal computer buses==\n\n===Parallel===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[ASUS Media Bus]] proprietary, used on some [[ASUS]]

Doubleday Publishing (1981). {{ISBN|0-385-14143-2}}</ref> The \"Stern\" (German for ''star'') refers to the board's star shape (in contrast to the square board used in Halma). \n\nThe name \"Chinese Checkers\" originated in the United States as a marketing scheme by Bill and Jack Pressman in 1928. The [[Pressman Toy Corporation|Pressman company's]] game was originally called \"Hop Ching Checkers\".<ref name=\"EoPiTS137\">Rodney P. Carlisle: Encyclopedia of Play in Today\u2019s Society, Band 1, SAGE, 2009, p. 137.</ref>\n\nThe game was introduced to Chinese-speaking regions mostly by the Japanese.<ref name=\"Johns\" />\n\n==Rules==\n[[Image:Chinese checkers jump.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A single move can consist of multiple hops; each piece hopped must be directly adjacent, and hops can be in any direction.]]\nThe aim is to race all one's pieces into the star corner on the opposite side of the board before opponents do the same. The destination corner is called ''home''. Each player has 10 pieces, except in games between two players when 15 are used.<ref>Parlett (1999), p. 135.</ref> (On bigger star boards, 15 or 21 pieces are used.<ref>Mohr (1997), p. 76.</ref>)\n\nIn \"hop across\", the most popular variation, each player starts with their colored pieces on one of the six points or corners of the star and attempts to race them all home into the opposite corner. Players take turns moving a single piece, either by moving one step in any direction to an adjacent empty space, or by jumping in one or any number of available consecutive hops over other single pieces. A player may not combine hopping with a single-step move&nbsp;\u2013 a move consists of one or the other. There is no capturing in Chinese Checkers, so hopped pieces remain active and in play. Turns proceed clockwise around the board.<ref name=\"Bell\"/>\n\nIn the diagram, Green might move the topmost piece one space diagonally forward as shown. A ''hop'' consists of jumping over a single adjacent piece, either one's own or an opponent's, to the empty space directly beyond it in the same line of direction. Red might advance the indicated piece by a chain of three hops in a single move. It is not mandatory to make the most number of hops possible. (In some instances a player may choose to stop the jumping sequence part way in order to impede the opponent's progress, or to align pieces for planned future moves.)\n\n===Starting layouts===\n\n====Six players====\nCan be played \"all versus all\", or three teams of two. When playing teams, teammates usually sit at opposite corners of the star, with each team member controlling their own colored set of pieces. The first team to advance both sets to their home destination corners is the winner. The remaining players usually continue play to determine second- and third-place finishers, etc.\n\n====Four players====\nThe four-player game is the same as the game for six players, except that two opposite corners will be unused.\n\n====Three players====\n[[Image:160327 Chinese checkers 02.jpg|thumb|A three-player game]]\nIn a three-player game, all players control either one or two sets of pieces each. If one set is used, pieces race across the board into empty, opposite corners. If two sets are used, each player controls two differently colored sets of pieces at opposite corners of the star.\n\n====Two players====\nIn a two-player game, each player plays one, two, or three sets of pieces. If one set is played, the pieces usually go into the opponent's starting corner, and the number of pieces per side is increased to 15 (instead of the usual 10). If two sets are played, the pieces can either go into the opponent's starting corners, or one of the players' two sets can go into an opposite empty corner. If three sets are played, the pieces usually go into the opponent's starting corners.\n\n==Strategy==\nA basic strategy is to create or find the longest hopping path that leads closest to home, or immediately into it. (Multiple-jump moves are obviously faster to advance pieces than step-by-step moves.) Since either player can make use of any hopping 'ladder' or 'chain' created, a more advanced strategy involves hindering an opposing player in addition to helping oneself make jumps across the board. Of equal importance are the players' strategies for emptying and filling their starting and home corners. Games between top players are rarely decided by more than a couple of moves.\n\nDiffering numbers of players result in different starting layouts, in turn imposing different best-game strategies. For example, if a player's home destination corner starts empty (i.e. is not an opponent's starting corner), the player can freely build a 'ladder' or 'bridge' with their pieces between the two opposite ends. But if a player's opponent occupies the home corner, the player may need to wait for opponent pieces to clear before filling the home vacancies.\n\n==Variants==\n\n===Fast-paced or Super Chinese Checkers===\nWhile the standard rules allow hopping over only a single adjacent occupied position at a time (as in checkers), this version of the game allows pieces to catapult over multiple adjacent occupied positions in a line when hopping.\n\nIn the ''fast-paced'' or ''Super Chinese Checkers'' variant popular in France,<ref>Schmittberger (1992), p. 8.</ref> a piece may hop over a ''non-adjacent'' piece. A hop consists of jumping over a distant piece (friendly or enemy) to a symmetrical position on the opposite side, in the same line of direction. (For example, if there are two empty positions between the jumping piece and the piece being jumped, the jumping piece lands leaving exactly two empty positions immediately beyond the jumped piece.) As in the standard rules, a jumping move may consist of any number of a chain of hops. (When making a chain of hops, a piece is usually allowed to enter an empty corner, as long as it hops out again before the move is completed.)\n\nJumping over two or more pieces in a hop is not allowed. Therefore, in this variant even more than in the standard version, it is sometimes strategically important to keep one's pieces bunched in order to prevent a long opposing hop.\n\nAn alternative variant allows hops over ''any'' symmetrical arrangement, including pairs of pieces, pieces separated by empty positions, and so on.\n\n===Capture===\nIn the ''capture'' variant, all sixty game pieces start out in the [[hexagon]]al field in the center of the gameboard. The center position is left unoccupied, so pieces form a symmetric hexagonal pattern. Color is irrelevant in this variant, so players take turns hopping any game piece over any other eligible game piece(s) on the board. The hopped-over pieces are captured (retired from the game, as in [[English draughts]]) and collected in the capturing player's bin. Only jumping moves are allowed; the game ends when no further jumps are possible. The player with the most captured pieces is the winner.\n\nThe board is tightly packed at the start of the game; as more pieces are captured, the board frees up, often allowing multiple captures to take place in a single move.\n\nTwo or more players can compete in this variant, but if there are more than six players, not everyone will get a fair turn.\n\nThis variant resembles the game [[Leap Frog (board game)|Leap Frog]].<ref>{{bgg|35722|Leapfrog}}</ref> The main difference being that in Leap Frog the board is a square board.\n\n===Diamond game===\n[[File:Diamond Game.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|'''Diamond game''' board with 73 playing spaces]]\n\nDiamond game is a variant of Chinese Checkers played in South Korea and Japan. It uses the same jump rule as in Chinese Checkers. The aim of the game is to enter all one's pieces into the star corner on the opposite side of the board, before opponents do the same.  Each player has ten or fifteen pieces.  Ten-piece diamond uses a smaller gameboard than Chinese Checkers, with 73 spaces.

It is the world's largest toad. It is a member of the genus ''[[Rhinella]]'', but was formerly in the genus ''[[Bufo]]'', which includes many different true toad [[species]] found throughout Central and South America. The cane toad is a prolific breeder; females lay single-clump [[spawn (biology)|spawns]] with thousands of [[egg (biology)|eggs]]. Its reproductive success is partly because of opportunistic feeding: it has a diet, unusual among [[Frog|anurans]], of both dead and living matter. Adults average {{convert|10|\u2013|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length; the largest recorded specimen had a snout-vent length of {{convert|24|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"ufwildlife.ifas.ufl.edu\">http://ufwildlife.ifas.ufl.edu/frogs/canetoad.shtml</ref>\n\nThe cane toad is an old species.

Because of its voracious appetite, the cane toad has been introduced to many regions of the Pacific and the Caribbean islands as a method of agricultural [[pest control]]. The species derives its common name from its use against the [[cane beetle]] (''Dermolepida albohirtum''). The cane toad is now considered a pest and an [[invasive species]] in many of its introduced regions; of particular concern is its toxic skin, which kills many animals, both wild and domesticated. Cane toads are particularly dangerous to dogs.<ref>[http://www.petmd.com/dog/conditions/toxicity/c_dg_toad_venom_toxicosis# Toad Venom Toxicosis in Dogs]</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\nHistorically, the cane toads were used to eradicate pests from [[sugarcane]], giving rise to their common name. The cane toad has many other common names, including \"giant  toad\" and \"marine toad\"; the former refers to its size, and the latter to the [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]], ''R. marina''. It was one of many species described by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th-century work ''[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|Systema Naturae]]'' (1758).<ref name=\"Linnaeus1758p824\">{{Harvnb|Linnaeus|1758|p=824}}</ref> Linnaeus based the [[specific name (zoology)|specific epithet]] ''marina'' on an illustration by Dutch zoologist [[Albertus Seba]], who mistakenly believed the cane toad to inhabit both terrestrial and marine environments.<ref name=\"beltz2007\">{{Harvnb|Beltz|2007}}</ref> Other common names include \"giant neotropical toad\",<ref name=\"Easteal1985p185\">{{Harvnb|Easteal|van Beurden|Floyd|Sabath|1985|p=185}}</ref> \"Dominican toad\",<ref name=\"InvasiveSpeciesInfo\">{{cite web | title = Cane Toad (Bufo marinus) | work = National Invasive Species Information Center | publisher = [[United States Department of Agriculture]] | date = June 15, 2009 | url = http://www.invasivespeciesinfo.gov/animals/canetoad.shtml | accessdate = June 17, 2009 }}</ref> \"giant marine toad\",<ref name=\"Caughley1996\">{{Harvnb|Caughley|Gunn|1996|p=140}}</ref> and \"South American cane toad\".<ref name=\"CSIROBiodiversity\">{{Harvnb|Australian State of the Environment Committee|2002|p=107}}</ref> In [[Trinidad]]ian English, they are commonly called ''crapaud'', the French word for toad.<ref name=\"Kenny2008\">{{Harvnb|Kenny|2008|p=35}}</ref>\n\nThe genus ''Rhinella'' is considered to constitute a distinct [[genus]] of its own, thus changing the [[scientific name]] of the cane toad.

Tadpoles typically hatch within 48&nbsp;hours, but the period can vary from 14&nbsp;hours to almost a week.<ref name=\"Tyler1989p116\" /> This process usually involves thousands of tadpoles\u2014which are small, black, and have short tails\u2014forming into groups.

Classified as an invasive species in over 20 countries, there are multiple reports of the cane toad moving into a new area to be followed by a decline in the biodiversity in that region. The most documented region of the cane toad's invasion and subsequent effect on native species is [[Cane toads in Australia|Australia]], where multiple surveys and observations of the toad's conquest have been completed. The best way to illustrate this effect is through the plight of the [[northern quoll]], as well as [[Mertens' water monitor]], a large lizard native to South and Southeast Asia.\n\nTwo sites were chosen to study the effects of cane toads on the northern quoll, one of which was at Mary River ranger station, which is located in the southern region of [[Kakadu National Park]]. The other site was located at the north end of the park. In addition to these two sites, there was a third site located at the East Alligator ranger station, and this site was used as a control site, where the cane toads would not interact with the northern quoll population. Monitoring of the quoll population began at the Mary River ranger station using radio tracking in 2002, months before the first cane toads arrived at the site. After the arrival of the cane toads, the population of northern quolls in the Mary River site plummeted between October and December 2002, and by March 2003, the northern quoll appeared to be extinct in this section of the park,<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/key-threatening-processes/biological-effects-cane-toads|title = The biological effects, including lethal toxic ingestion, caused by Cane Toads (Bufo marinus).|date = April 12, 2005|accessdate = October 29, 2015|website = www.environment.gov.au|publisher = }}</ref> as there were no northern quolls caught in the trapping trips in the following two months. In contrast, the population of northern quolls in the control site at the East Alligator ranger station remained relatively constant, not showing any symptoms of declining. The evidence from the Kakadu National Park is compelling not only because of the timing of the population of northern quolls plummeting just months after the arrival of the cane toad, but also because in the Mary River region 31% of mortalities within the quoll population were attributed to lethal toxic ingestion, as there were no signs of disease, parasite infestation, or any other obvious changes at the site that could have caused such a rapid decline.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/key-threatening-processes/biological-effects-cane-toads|title = The biological effects, including lethal toxic ingestion, caused by cane toads (Bufo marinus)|date = April 12, 2005|accessdate = October 29, 2015|website = www.environment.gov.au|publisher = }}</ref> The most obvious piece of evidence which supports the hypothesis that the invasion of the cane toads caused the [[local extinction]] of the northern quoll is that the closely monitored population of the control group, in the absence of cane toads, showed no signs of decline.\n\nIn the case of the [[Mertens' water monitor]], there was only one region that was monitored, but over the course of 18 months. This region is located 70 kilometers south of [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], at the Manton Dam Recreation Area.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cane Toads reduce the abundance and site occupancy of Mertens' water monitor (''Varanus mertensi'')|last = Griffiths|first = Anthony|date = 2007|journal = Wildlife Research|doi = 10.1071/wr07024 |pmid = |access-date = |volume=34 |pages=609}}</ref>  Within the Manton Dam Recreation Area, there were 14 sites set up to survey the population of water monitors, measuring abundance and site occupancy at each one. Seven surveys were conducted, each of which ran for four weeks and included 16 site visits, where each site was sampled twice per day for two consecutive days throughout the 4 weeks. Each site visit occurred between 7:30\u201310:30 AM,  and 4:00\u20137:00 PM, when ''Varanus mertensi'' can be viewed sunbathing on the shore or wrapped around a tree branch close to shore. The whole project lasted from December 2004 to May 2006, and unveiled a total of 194 sightings of ''Varanus mertensi'' in 1568 site visits. Of the seven surveys, abundance was highest during the second survey, which took place in February 2005, two months into the project. Following this measurement, the abundance declined in the next 4 surveys, before declining sharply after the second to last survey in February 2006. In the final survey taken in May 2006, there were only two ''Varanus mertensi'' observed. Cane toads were first recorded in the region of study during the second survey during February 2005, also when the water monitor abundance was at its highest over the course of the study. Numbers of the cane toad population stayed low for the next year after introduction, and then skyrocketed to its peak in the last survey during May 2006. When you compare the two populations side by side one can see clearly that the onset of the cane toads had an immediate negative impact on the ''Varanus mertensi'', as their population began to drop in February 2005, which was when the first cane toads entered the Manton Dam Recreation Area.  At the end of the study, some scattered population of water monitors remained in the upper sites of the Manton Dam, which suggests that local extinctions occurred at certain shoreline sites within Manton Dam, but a complete extinction of the population did not occur.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cane toads reduce the abundance and site occupancy of Mertens' water monitor (''Varanus mertensi'')|last = Griffiths|first = Anthony|date = 2007|journal = Wildlife Research|doi = 10.1071/wr07024 |pmid = |access-date = |volume=34 |pages=609}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Footnotes===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite journal|url = |title = Cane toads reduce the abundance and site occupancy of Merten's water monitor (Varanus Mertensi)|last = Griffiths|first = Anthony|date = 2007|journal = Wildlife Research|doi =10.1071/wr07024  |pmid = |access-date = |volume=34 |pages=609}}\n* {{Cite web|url = https://www.environment.gov.au/biodiversity/threatened/key-threatening-processes/biological-effects-cane-toads|title = The biological effects, including lethal toxic ingestion, caused by cane toads (Bufo marinus)|date = April 12, 2005|accessdate = October 29, 2015|website = Australian Government|publisher = |last =Australian Government |first =Department of the Environment }}\n* {{cite journal | last = Alcala | first = A.

This record is now in the [[Public Record Office]]. In 1868, the first croquet all-comers meet was held at [[Moreton-in-Marsh]], [[Gloucestershire]] and in the same year the All England Croquet Club was formed at [[Wimbledon, London]].\n\nRegardless when and by what route it reached [[England]] and the [[British Empire|British colonies]] in its recognizable form, croquet is, like [[golf]], [[pall-mall]], [[trucco]], and [[Kolven#History|kolven]], among the later forms of [[ground billiards]], which as a class have been popular in Western Europe back to at least the [[Late Middle Ages]], with roots in [[classical antiquity]], including sometimes the use of arches and pegs along with [[Ball (sports)|balls]] and [[mallet]]s or other striking sticks (some more akin to modern [[field hockey]] sticks).<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999|117}}</ref><ref name=\"Clare\">{{Cite book\n|title=Billiards and Snooker Bygones |last=Clare |first=Norman |publisher=Shire Publications |location=Princes Risborough, England |year=1996 |origyear=1985 |page=5 |edition=amended |isbn=0-85263-730-6}}</ref><ref name=\"Stein & Rubino 2008\">{{Stein & Rubino 2008| 2, 4, 5, 14, 27}}</ref>  By the 12th century, a team ball game called ''{{lang|frm|la soule}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|choule}}'', akin to a chaotic version of hockey or football (depending on whether sticks were used), was regularly played in France and southern Britain between villages or parishes; it was attested in [[Cornwall]] as early as 1283.<ref>{{cite book |title=Medieval Cornwall |author-link=Leonard Elliott Elliot-Binns |first=L. E. |last=Elliot-Binns |publisher=Methuen & Co. |location=London}}</ref>{{page needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nIn the book ''Queen of Games: The History of Croquet'',<ref>{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Nicky |title=Queen of Games: The History of Croquet |publisher=George Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=1991 |isbn=0-297-81176-2}}</ref> Nicky Smith presents two theories of the origin of the modern game of croquet, which took England by storm in the 1860s and then spread overseas.\n\nThe first explanation is that the ancestral game was introduced to [[Great Britain|Britain]] from [[France]] during the 1630\u20131685 reign of [[Charles II of England]], and was played under the name of ''{{lang|enm|paille-maille}}'' (among other spellings, today usually ''pall-mall''), derived ultimately from Latin words for 'ball and mallet' (the latter also found in the name of the earlier French game, ''{{lang|frm|[[jeu de mail]]}}'').  This was the explanation given in the ninth edition of ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', dated 1877.  \n\nIn his 1810 book ''The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England'', Joseph Strutt described the way pall-mall was played in England at the time: \"Pale-maille is a game wherein a round [[Boxwood|box&#91;wood&#93;]] ball is struck with a mallet through a high arch of iron, which he that can do at the fewest blows, or at the number agreed upon, wins.  It is to be observed, that there are two of these arches, that is one at either end of the alley. The game of mall was a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles the Second, and the walk in Saint James's Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been appropriated to the purpose of playing at mall, where Charles himself and his courtiers frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sports and Pastimes of the People of England |first= Joseph |last=Strutt |page=96 |date=1810 |via=Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nSKFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA96 |access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nWhile the name ''pall-mall'' and various games bearing this name also appeared elsewhere (France and Italy), the description above suggests that the croquet-like games in particular were popular in England by the early 17th century.  Some other [[Early modern era|early modern]] sources refer to pall-mall being played over a large distance (as in golf); however, an image in Strutt's 1801 book shows a croquet-like ground billiards game (balls on ground, hoop, bats and peg) being played over a {{em|short}}, garden-sized distance.  The image's caption describes the game as \"a curious ancient pastime\", confirming that croquet games were not new in early nineteenth century England.\n[[File:EarlyCroquetSportsofPeopleofEnglandStrutt.jpg|thumb|Early croquet-like game from ''The Sports and Pastimes of the People of England'', first published 1801. Hoop, peg and two players with balls clearly shown.  Such implements in [[ground billiards]] games date to [[classical antiquity]].]]\n\nIn [[Samuel Johnson]]'s 1755 dictionary, his definition of \"pall-mall\" clearly describes a game with similarities to modern croquet: \"A play in which the ball is struck with a mallet through an iron ring\".<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=z3kKAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA2-PA519&dq=pelmel#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title= A dictionary of the English language |first1= Samuel | first2= John |last2= Walker |first3= Robert S. |last3= Jameson |page=519 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |year= 1828|author1= Johnson }}</ref> However, there is no evidence that pall-mall involved the croquet stroke which is the distinguishing characteristic of the modern game.\n\nThe second theory is that the rules of the modern game of croquet arrived from [[Ireland]] during the 1850s, perhaps after being brought there from [[Brittany]] where a similar game was played on the beaches. Regular contact between Ireland and France had continued since the [[Norman invasion of Ireland]] in 1169. By no later than the early 15th century, the game ''{{lang|frm|jeu de mail}}'' (itself ancestral to pall-mall and perhaps to indoor [[Cue sports#History|billiards]]) was popular in France, including in the courts of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] in the 16th century and [[Louis XIV]] of the 17th. \n\nAt least one version of it, ''{{lang|frm|rou\u00ebt}}'' ('wheel') was a multi-ball lawn game.  Records show a game called \"crookey\", similar to croquet, being played at [[Castlebellingham]] in County Louth, Ireland, in 1834, which was introduced to [[Galway]] in 1835 and played on the bishop's palace garden, and in the same year to the genteel Dublin suburb of Kingstown (today [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]]) where it was first spelt as \"croquet\".<ref>''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'', 8 August 2009, p. 50.</ref> There is, however, no pre-1858 Irish document that describes the way game was played, in particular there is no reference to the distinctive croquet stroke.<ref name=\"prichard\">{{cite book |last=Prichard |first=D.

What is this stroke, and what is distinctive about it?}} The noted croquet historian Dr Prior, in his book of 1872, makes the categoric statement \"One thing only is certain: it is from Ireland that croquet came to England and it was on the lawn of the late Lord Lonsdale that it was first played in this country.\" This was about 1851.<ref>{{cite book| title=A Brief History of Croquet in Ireland |first1=Clive |last1=Martin |first2=Simon |last2=Williams |year=2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eglington1.JPG|thumb|left|A game of Croquet being played at [[Eglinton Country Park|Eglinton Castle]], North Ayrshire, in the early 1860s]]\nJohn Jaques apparently claimed in a letter to [[Arthur Lillie]] in 1873 that he had himself seen the game played in Ireland, writing \"I made the implements and published directions (such as they were) before Mr. Spratt [mentioned above] introduced the subject to me.\"<ref>{{Cite book |title=Croquet: Its History, Rules, and Secrets |first= Arthur |last=Lillie |page=29 |publisher=Longmans, Green |date=1897 |via=Google Books |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=irBDAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA29&lpg=PA29 |access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> Whatever the truth of the matter, Jaques certainly played an important role in popularising the game, producing editions of the rules in 1857, 1860, and 1864.\n\nCroquet became highly popular as a social pastime in England during the 1860s. It was enthusiastically adopted and promoted by the [[Arthur Algernon Capell, 6th Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] who held lavish croquet parties at [[Cassiobury House]], his stately home in [[Watford]], [[Hertfordshire]], and the Earl even launched his own ''Cassiobury'' brand croquet set.<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url= http://www.watfordcroquet.org.uk/history.php |work=WatfordCroquet.org.uk |publisher=Watford Cassiobury Croquet Club |access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Reid |first1=Mayne |title=Croquet, etc |date=1869 |page=46 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bxVdAAAAcAAJ&dq=Croquet%2C%20etc.&pg=PA46#v=onepage&q&f=false |access-date=7 December 2014}}</ref> By 1867, Jaques had printed 65,000 copies of his ''Laws and Regulations'' of the game. It quickly spread to other [[English language|Anglophone]] countries, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Africa]], and the [[United States]]. No doubt one of the attractions was that the game could be played by both sexes; this also ensured a certain amount of adverse comment.\n\n[[File:M\u00e4n och kvinnor spelar krocket framf\u00f6r hus p\u00e5 Liding\u00f6 - Nordiska Museet - NMA.0040765.jpg|thumb|Croquet players in Sweden, early 20th century.]]\nBy the late 1870s, however, croquet had been eclipsed by another fashionable game, [[tennis|lawn tennis]], and many of the newly created croquet clubs, including the All England Club at Wimbledon, converted some or all of their lawns into [[tennis court]]s. There was a revival in the 1890s, but from then onwards, croquet was always a minority sport, with national individual participation amounting to a few thousand players. The [[All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club]] still has a croquet lawn, but has not hosted any significant tournaments. The English headquarters for the game is now in [[Cheltenham]].\n\n\nThe earliest known reference to croquet in Scotland is the booklet ''The Game of Croquet, its Laws and Regulations'' which was published in the mid-1860s for the proprietor of Eglinton Castle, the [[Earl of Eglinton]]. On the page facing the title page is a picture of Eglinton Castle with a game of \"croquet\" in full swing.<ref name=\"C\">{{Cite book |chapter=Introduction |url=http://www.edinburghcroquetclub.com/intro.html |title=Edinburgh Croquet Club |accessdate=4 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710171159/http://www.edinburghcroquetclub.com/intro.html |archive-date=10 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe croquet lawn existed on the northern terrace, between [[Eglinton Castle]] and the Lugton Water. The 13th Earl developed a variation on croquet named Captain Moreton's Eglinton Castle croquet, which had small bells on the eight hoops \"to ring the changes\", two pegs, a double hoop with a bell and two tunnels for the ball to pass through. In 1865 the 'Rules of the Eglinton Castle and Cassiobury Croquet' was published by [[Edmund Routledge]].  Several incomplete sets of this form of croquet are known to exist, and one complete set is still used for demonstration games in the West of Scotland.<ref name=\"C\"/>\n\n==Competitive variations==\nThere are several variations of croquet currently played, differing in the scoring systems, order of shots, and layout (particularly in social games where play must be adapted to smaller-than-standard playing courts). Two forms of the game, association croquet and golf croquet, have rules that are agreed internationally and are played in many countries around the world. The United States has its own set of rules for domestic games. [[Gateball]], a sport originated in Japan under the influence of croquet, is played mainly in [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and [[Western Hemisphere|the Americas]] and can also be regarded as a croquet variant.\n\nAs well as club-level games, there are regular world championships and international matches between croquet-playing countries. The sport has particularly strong followings in the UK, US, New Zealand and Australia; every four years, these countries play the [[MacRobertson International Croquet Shield|MacRobertson Shield]] tournament. Many other countries also play.

However, purely negative play is rarely a winning strategy: successful players (in all versions other than golf croquet) will use all four balls to set up a break for themselves, rather than simply making the game as difficult as possible for their opponents. At championship-standard association croquet, players can often make all 26 points (13 for each ball) in two turns.\n\nCroquet [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|was an event]] at the [[1900 Summer Olympics]]. [[Roque]], an American variation on croquet, [[Roque at the 1904 Summer Olympics|was an event]] at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]].\n\n==Pronunciation==\nAs with similar words with a French derivation, the final 't' is silent. British pronunciation puts the accent on the first syllable, American on the second: {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|r|o\u028a|k|e\u026a}} versus {{IPAc-en|k|r|o\u028a|\u02c8|k|e\u026a}}.\n\n==Variations==\n\n===Association===\n[[File:Croquetplayers.jpg|thumb|Croquet being played at a club in the UK. (Four balls are visible on the lawn, showing that two games are in progress (\"double-banking\"): red and black belong to one game, green and brown to the other)]]\nAssociation croquet is the name of an advanced game of croquet, played at international level. It involves four balls teamed in pairs, with both balls going through every hoop for one pair to win. The game's distinguishing feature is the \"croquet\" shot: when certain balls hit other balls, extra shots are allowed. The six hoops are arranged three at each end of the court, with a centre peg.\n\nIn association croquet one side takes the black and blue balls, the other takes red and yellow. At each turn, players can choose to play with either of their balls for that turn.\nAt the start of a turn, the player plays a stroke. If the player either hits the ball through the correct hoop (\"runs\" the hoop), or hits another ball (a \"roquet\"), the turn continues.\n\nFollowing a roquet, the player picks up his or her own ball and puts it down next to the ball that it hit. The next shot is played with the two balls touching: this is the \"croquet stroke\" from which the game takes its name. By varying the speed and angle at which the mallet hits the striker's ball, a good player can control the final position of both balls: the horizontal angle determines how much the balls diverge in direction, while the vertical angle and the amount of follow-through determine the relative distance that the two balls travel.\n\nAfter the croquet stroke, the player plays a \"continuation\" stroke, during which the player may again attempt to make a roquet or run a hoop. Each of the other three balls may be roqueted once in a turn before a hoop is run, after which they become available to be roqueted again.\n\nThe winner of the game is the team who completes the set circuit of six hoops (and then back again the other way), with both balls, and then strikes the centre peg (making a total of 13 points per ball = 26).\n\nGood players may make \"breaks\" of several hoops in a single turn.  The best players may take a ball round a full circuit in one turn. \"Advanced play\" (a variant of association play for expert players) gives penalties to a player who runs certain hoops in a turn, to allow the opponent a chance of getting back into the game; feats of skill such as triple peels or better, in which the partner ball (or occasionally an opponent ball) is caused to run a number of hoops in a turn by the striker's ball help avoid these penalties.\n\nA handicap system ('bisques') provides less experienced players a chance of winning against more formidable opponents. Players of all ages and both sexes compete on level terms.\n\nThe World Championships are organised by the [[World Croquet Federation]] (WCF)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wcfcroquet.org/ |title=WFC News |date=9 September 2010 |publisher=World Croquet Federation |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722003255/http://www.wcfcroquet.org/ |archivedate=22 July 2010 }}</ref> and usually take place every 2 or 3 years. The 2018 championships took place in Wellington, New Zealand, the winner being Paddy Chapman of New Zealand. The current Women's Association Croquet World Champion (2015) is Miranda Chapman of England.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.croquetrecords.com/records/womensworlds/worlds2015.htm |title=Women's World Championship| date=1 August 2015 |publisher=Croquet Records Website|accessdate=1 August 2015}}</ref> Paddy and Miranda are married.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Croquet Gazette|issue=373|date=April 2018|title=Paddy Chapman wins the AC World Championship}}</ref> \n\nThe Australian team won the last [[MacRobertson International Croquet Shield]] tournament, which is the major international test tour trophy in association croquet. It is contested every three to four years between Australia, England, the United States and New Zealand. Historically the British have been the dominant force, winning 14 times out of the twenty two times that the event has been held. In individual competition, the UK is often divided by subnational country (England, Scotland and [[Wales]]), while Northern Ireland joins with the republic in an All Ireland association (as it does in other sports).\n\nThe world's top 10 association croquet players as of February 2018 were Robert Fletcher (Australia), [[Reg Bamford (croquet player)|Reg Bamford]] (South Africa), [[Robert Fulford (croquet player)|Robert Fulford]] (England), Paddy Chapman (New Zealand), [[Ben Rothman]] (USA), Malcolm Fletcher (Australia), Jamie Burch (England), Jose Riva (Spain), [[Stephen Mulliner]] (England), Greg Bryant (New Zealand), .<ref name=\"Chris Williams\">{{cite web |url= http://butedock.demon.co.uk/cgs/rank.php |title=Croquet Grading System |first= Chris |last= Williams |accessdate=11 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nUnlike most sports, men and women compete and are ranked together. Three women have won the British Open Championship: [[Lily Gower]] in 1905, Dorothy Steel in 1925, 1933, 1935 and 1936, and Hope Rotherham in 1960. While male players are in the majority at club level in the UK, the opposite is the case in Australia and New Zealand.<ref name=\"Chris Williams\"/>\n\nThe governing body in England is The [[Croquet Association]], which has been the driving force of the development of the game. The rules and tournament regulations are now maintained by the International Laws Committee, established by the croquet associations of England and Wales (CA), Australia (ACA), New Zealand (CNZ) and the United States (USCA).\n\n===Golf===\nIn golf croquet, a hoop is won by the first ball to go through each hoop. Unlike association croquet, there are no additional turns for hitting other balls.\n\nEach player takes a stroke in turn, each trying to hit a ball through the same hoop. The sequence of play is blue, red, black, yellow. Blue and black balls play against red and yellow. When a hoop is won, the sequence of play continues as before. The winner of the game is the player/team who wins the most hoops.\n\nGolf croquet is the fastest-growing version of the game,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.croquet.org.uk/ca/survey/2007/survey.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101121030026/http://croquet.org.uk/ca/survey/2007/survey.htm | archivedate= 21 November 2010 | title=Older, Wealthier and with a bit to Think about |first= Kevin |last= Carter |year=2007 |publisher= The Croquet Association| accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref> owing largely to its simplicity and competitiveness.

The rules are easy to learn and the game can be played on lawns of almost any size but usually around {{convert|32|ft|m|disp=x| wide (|)}} by {{convert|40|ft|m|disp=x| long (|)|abbr=on}}. The rules are similar to those described above for Association Croquet with three major differences:\n\n# The starting point for all balls is a spot {{Convert|3|ft|spell = in}} in from the boundary directly in front of hoop 1.\n# If a striker's ball goes off, there is no penalty, it comes back on {{Convert|3|ft|spell = in}} and the turn continues.\n# In a croquet stroke the croqueted ball does not have to move when the striker's ball is struck.\n\nThis version of the game is easy for beginners to learn. The main Garden Croquet Club in the UK is the Bygrave Croquet Club which is a private club with five lawns. Other clubs also use garden croquet as an introduction to the game, notably the Hampstead Heath Croquet Club and the Watford Croquet Club.\n\n[[File:TwilightCroquet4034.JPG|thumb|upright|left|An American game of croquet at twilight]]\n\n===American six-wicket===\nThe American rules version of croquet, another six-hoop game, is the dominant version of the game in the United States and is also widely played in [[Canada]]. It is [[Sports governing body|governed]] by the [[United States Croquet Association]]. Its genesis is mostly in association croquet, but it differs in a number of important ways that reflect the home-grown traditions of American \"backyard\" croquet.\n\nTwo of the most notable differences are that the balls are always played in the same sequence (blue, red, black, yellow) throughout the game, and that a ball's \"deadness\" on other balls is carried over from turn to turn until the ball has been \"cleared\" by scoring its next hoop. A Deadness Board is used to keep track of deadness on all four balls.  Tactics are simplified on the one hand by the strict sequence of play, and complicated on the other hand by the continuation of deadness. A further difference is the more restrictive boundary-line rules of American croquet.<ref name=\"Ian Plummer\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordcroquet.com/laws/usca/index.asp |title=Association vs US (6-wicket) Rules Croquet |first= Ian |last= Plummer |date=1 January 2011 |publisher=Oxford Croquet  |accessdate=22 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn the American game, roqueting a ball out of bounds or running a hoop out of bounds causes the turn to end, and balls that go out of bounds are replaced only {{convert|9|in|spell=in|cm}} from the boundary rather than {{Convert|1|yd|cm|spell = in}} as in association croquet.<ref name=\"Ian Plummer\"/> \"Attacking\" balls on the boundary line to bring them into play is thus far more challenging.\n\n===Nine-wicket===\nNine-wicket croquet, sometimes called \"backyard croquet\", is played mainly in Canada and the United States, and is the game most recreational players in those countries call simply \"croquet\".  In this version of croquet there are nine wickets, two stakes, and up to six balls.  The course is arranged in a double-diamond pattern, with one stake at each end of the course.  Players start at one stake, navigate one side of the double diamond, hit the turning stake, then navigate the opposite side of the double diamond and hit the starting stake to end.  If playing individually (''Cutthroat''), the first player to stake out is the winner.  In partnership play, all members of a team must stake out, and a player might choose to avoid staking out (becoming a ''Rover'') in order to help a lagging teammate.\n\nEach time a ball is roqueted, the striker gets two bonus shots.\nFor the first bonus shot, the player has four options:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.9wicketcroquet.com/rules/26/backyard-croquet-basic-rules|title=9-Wicket Croquet: Backyard Croquet: Basic Rules|author=|date=|website=www.9wicketcroquet.com}}</ref>\n* From a mallet-head distance or less away from the ball that was hit (\"taking a mallet-head\")\n* From a position in contact with the ball that was hit, with the striker ball held steady by the striker's foot or hand (a \"foot shot\" or \"hand shot\")\n* From a position in contact with the ball that was hit, with the striker ball not held by foot or hand (a \"croquet shot\")\n* From where the striker ball stopped after the roquet.\nThe second bonus shot (\"continuation shot\") is an ordinary shot played from where the striker ball came to rest.\n\nAn alternate endgame is \"poison\": in this variant, a player who has scored the last wicket but not hit the starting stake becomes a \"poison ball\", which may eliminate other balls from the game by roqueting them.  A non-poison ball that roquets a poison ball has the normal options.  A poison ball that hits a stake or passes through any wicket (possibly by the action of a non-poison player) is eliminated.  The last person remaining is the winner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.9wicketcroquet.com/rules/28/backyard-croquet-challenging-options#option6|title=9-Wicket Croquet: Backyard Croquet: Challenging Options|author=|date=|website=www.9wicketcroquet.com}}</ref>\n\n===Ricochet===\nThis version of the game was invented by John Riches of [[Adelaide, Australia]] with help from Tom Armstrong in the 1980s. The game can be played by up to six people and is very easy to learn. For this reason it is often used as a stepping stone to association croquet. \n\nRicochet has similar rules to association and garden croquet, except that when a ball is roqueted, the striker's ball remains live and two free shots are earned. This enables strikers to play their ball near to another opponent ball and ricochet that too thus earning two more free shots. Running a hoop earns one free shot.\n\n==Glossary of terms==\n[[File:CroquetConverse4037.JPG|thumb|Backyard croquet being played in rough grass with inexpensive equipment, United States, 2009]]\n* '''Backward ball''': The ball of a side that has scored fewer hoops (compare with 'forward ball').<ref name=\"Hawkins\">{{cite book|title=Complete Croquet: A Guide to Skills, Tactics, and Strategy|first= James |last= Hawkins|publisher=Crowood Press|isbn=978-1-84797-168-5|year=2010}}</ref>\n* '''Ball-in-hand''': A ball that the striker can pick up to change its position, for example:\n*# any ball when it leaves the court has to be replaced on the yard-line\n*# the striker\u2019s ball after making a roquet must be placed in contact with the roqueted ball\n*# the striker\u2019s ball when the striker is entitled to a lift.<ref name=\"laws\">''[http://www.croquet.org.uk/association/laws/6th/laws_6th.htm Laws of Association Croquet]'', 6th Edition, amended 2008, Croquet Association.</ref>\n* '''Ball in play''': A ball after it has been played into the game, which is not a ball in hand or pegged out.<ref name=\"laws\" />\n* '''Baulk''': An imaginary line on which a ball is placed for its first shot in the game, or when taking a lift.

It is related to [[bowls]], [[boules]] and [[shuffleboard]]. Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished [[granite]] stones, also called ''rocks'', across the ice ''curling sheet'' towards the ''house'', a circular target marked on the ice.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wetzel |first=Dan |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/vancouver/curling/news?slug=dw-curling021810&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Don't take curling for granite |work=Yahoo!

The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a ''game''; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each ''end'', which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones. A game usually consists of eight or ten ends.\n\nThe curler can induce a curved path by causing the stone to slowly turn as it slides, and the path of the rock may be further influenced by two sweepers with brooms who accompany it as it slides down the sheet, using the brooms to alter the state of the ice in front of the stone. Sweeping a rock makes it curl less, and decreases the friction that slows the rock down. A great deal of strategy and teamwork go into choosing the ideal path and placement of a stone for each situation, and the skills of the curlers determine the degree to which the stone will achieve the desired result. This gives curling its nickname of \"[[chess]] on ice\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/01/28/pages/5296/index.xml |title='Chess on ice' |work=Princeton Allumni Weekly |date=28 January 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723010531/http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/01/28/pages/5296/index.xml |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://curlnews.blogspot.com/2007/06/chess-on-ice.html |title=Chess on ice |work=The Curling News |date=22 June 2007 |accessdate=10 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515190240/http://curlnews.blogspot.com/2007/06/chess-on-ice.html |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pieter Brueghel de Jonge - Winterlandschap met vogelval (Brukenthal Museum) (curling crop).jpg|thumb|Detail from a reproduction of ''Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap'' (Bruegel, 1565)]]\n\nEvidence that curling existed in Scotland in the early 16th century includes a curling stone inscribed with the date 1511 uncovered (along with another bearing the date 1551) when an old pond was drained at Dunblane, Scotland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/002022.asp |title=Wooden Curling Stone |publisher=[[Wisconsin Historical Society]] |date=23 February 2006 |accessdate=14 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105084908/http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/002022.asp |archivedate=5 November 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The world's oldest curling stone and the world's oldest football are now kept in the same museum (the [[Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum]]) in [[Stirling]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The world's oldest curling stone |url=http://www.smithartgalleryandmuseum.co.uk/about/the-collection/ |website=The Stirling Smith Art Gallery and Museum |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> The first written reference to a contest using stones on ice coming from the records of [[Paisley Abbey]], [[Renfrewshire]], in February 1541.<ref name=\"Scottish Curling\">{{cite web |title=History of the Game |url=http://www.scottishcurling.org/curling-history/history-of-the-game/ |website=Scottish Curling |accessdate=14 February 2018}}</ref> Two paintings, \"[[:File:Pieter Bruegel d. \u00c4. 093.jpg|Winter Landscape with a Bird Trap]]\" and \"[[The Hunters in the Snow]]\" (both dated 1565) by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] depict [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[peasant]]s curling, albeit without brooms; Scotland and the [[Low Countries]] had strong trading and cultural links during this period, which is also evident in the [[history of golf]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eberlin |first1=Amy |title=The Flemish and the game of \u2018curling\u2019 |url=http://flemish.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/2016/02/15/613/ |website=Scotland and the Flemish People |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Curling at Eglinton castle, Ayrshire, Scotland.jpg|thumb|left|A curling match at [[Eglinton Castle]], Ayrshire, Scotland in 1860.

The shorter borders of the sheet are called the backboards. Because of the elongated shape, several sheets may be laid out side by side in the same arena, allowing multiple games to be played simultaneously.\n\nA target, the ''house'', is centred on the intersection of the ''centre line'', drawn lengthwise down the centre of the sheet and the ''tee line'', drawn {{convert|16|ft|m}} from, and parallel to, the backboard. These lines divide the house into quarters. The house consists of a centre circle (the ''button'') and three concentric rings, of diameters 4, 8 and 12 feet, formed by painting or laying coloured [[Vinyl composition tile|vinyl]] sheet under the ice and are usually distinguished by colour. A stone must at least touch the outer ring in order to score (see [[#Scoring|Scoring]] below); otherwise the rings are merely a visual aid for aiming and judging which stone is closer to the button.\nTwo ''hog lines'' are drawn {{convert|37|ft|m}} from, and parallel to, the backboard.\n\nThe ''hacks'' are fixed {{convert|12|ft|m}} behind each button; a hack gives the thrower something to push against when making the throw. On indoor rinks, there are usually two fixed hacks, rubber-lined holes, one on each side of the centre line, with the inside edge no more than {{convert|3|in|mm}} from the centre line and the front edge on the hack line. A single moveable hack may also be used.\n\nThe ice may be natural but is usually frozen by a refrigeration plant pumping a brine solution through numerous pipes fixed lengthwise at the bottom of a shallow pan of water. Most curling clubs have an ice maker whose main job is to care for the ice. At the major curling championships, ice maintenance is extremely important. Large events, such as the [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]] or other national/international championships, are typically held in an arena that presents a challenge to the ice maker, who must constantly monitor and adjust the ice and air temperatures as well as air humidity levels to ensure a consistent playing surface. It is common for each sheet of ice to have multiple sensors embedded in order to monitor surface temperature, as well as probes set up in the seating area (to monitor humidity) and in the compressor room (to monitor brine supply and return temperatures). The surface of the ice is maintained at a temperature of around {{convert|23|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}.<ref name=\"branch\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/sports/17curling.html |last=Branch |first=John |title=Curlers Are Finicky When It Comes to Their Olympic Ice |work=The New York Times |date=17 August 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006062707/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/17/sports/17curling.html |archivedate=6 October 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA key part of the preparation of the playing surface is the spraying of water droplets onto the ice, which form ''pebble'' on freezing.

The handle allows the stone to be gripped and rotated upon release; on properly prepared ice the rotation will bend (''curl'') the path of the stone in the direction in which the front edge of the stone is turning, especially as the stone slows. Handles are coloured to identify each team, two popular colours in major tournaments being red and yellow.\nIn competition, an electronic handle known as the ''eye on the hog'' may be fitted to detect hog line violations. This electronically detects whether the thrower's hand is in contact with the handle as it passes the hog line and indicates a violation by lights at the base of the handle. The ''eye on the hog'' eliminates human error and the need for hog line officials. It is mandatory in high-level national and international competition, but its cost, around [[United States dollar|US$]]650 each, currently puts it beyond the reach of most club curling.\n\n=== Curling broom ===\n{{refimprove section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:Curling broom.png|thumb|left|Curling broom]]\nThe ''curling broom'', or ''brush'', is used to sweep the ice surface in the path of the stone (see ''[[#Sweeping|sweeping]]'') and is also often used as a balancing aid during delivery of the stone.\n\nPrior to the 1950s, most curling brooms were made of corn strands and were similar to household brooms of the day. In 1958, Fern Marchessault of Montreal inverted the corn straw in the centre of the broom. This style of corn broom was referred to as ''the Blackjack''.<ref name=\"curling.ca\">{{cite web |url=http://www.curling.ca/start-curling/the-history-of-curling/ |title=The History of Curling |publisher=[[Canadian Curling Association]] |date=18 January 2013 |accessdate=10 February 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210004409/http://www.curling.ca/start-curling/the-history-of-curling/ |archivedate=10 February 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nArtificial brooms made from man-made fabrics rather than corn, such as the ''Rink Rat'', also became common later during this time period. Prior to the late sixties, ''Scottish'' curling brushes were used primarily by some of the Scots, as well as by recreational and elderly curlers, as a substitute for corn brooms, since the technique was easier to learn. In the late sixties, competitive curlers from [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], such as John Mayer, Bruce Stewart, and, later, the world junior championship teams skipped by [[Paul Gowsell]], proved that the curling brush could be just as (or more) effective without all the blisters common to corn broom use.<ref name=\"curling.ca\"/> During that time period, there was much debate in competitive curling circles as to which sweeping device was more effective: brush or broom. Eventually, the brush won out with the majority of curlers making the switch to the less costly and more efficient brush. Today, brushes have replaced traditional corn brooms at every level of curling; it is rare now to see a curler using a corn broom on a regular basis.\n\nCurling brushes may have fabric, hog hair, or horsehair heads. Modern curling brush handles are usually hollow tubes made of [[fiberglass|fibreglass]] or [[carbon fiber|carbon fibre]] instead of a solid length of wooden [[dowel]]. These hollow tube handles are lighter and stronger than wooden handles, allowing faster sweeping and also enabling more downward force to be applied to the broom head with reduced shaft flex.  New, \"directional fabric\" brooms, which players are worried will alter the fundamentals of the sport by reducing the level of skill required, have been accused of giving players an unfair advantage.<ref>{{cite news |title=Top curling teams say they won't use high-tech brooms |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/top-curling-teams-say-they-won-t-use-high-tech-brooms-1.3274903 |accessdate=21 October 2015 |work=[[CBC News]] |date=16 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022035711/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/top-curling-teams-say-they-won-t-use-high-tech-brooms-1.3274903 |archivedate=22 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The new brooms were temporarily banned by the [[World Curling Federation]] and [[Curling Canada]]<ref name=\"MyUser_Ctvnews.ca_January_7_2016c\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/curling-canada-bans-broom-heads-with-directional-fabric-1.2677653 |title=Curling Canada bans broom heads with 'directional fabric' |newspaper=Ctvnews.ca |date= |author= |accessdate=7 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101232900/http://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/curling-canada-bans-broom-heads-with-directional-fabric-1.2677653 |archivedate=1 January 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> for the 2015\u20132016 season.

It is worn by the thrower during delivery from the hack and by sweepers or the skip to glide down the ice when sweeping or otherwise traveling down the sheet quickly. Stainless steel was once common for slider soles, and \"red brick\" sliders with lateral blocks of [[PVC]] on the sole are also available. Most shoes have a full-sole sliding surface, but some shoes have a sliding surface covering only the outline of the shoe and other enhancements with the full-sole slider. Some shoes have small disc sliders covering the front and heel portions or only the front portion of the foot, which allow more flexibility in the sliding foot for curlers playing with tuck deliveries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://glennpaulley.ca/curling/2011/05/22/curling-shoes-choosing-a-slider/ |title=Curling Shoes:Choosing a Slider |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418161202/http://glennpaulley.ca/curling/2011/05/22/curling-shoes-choosing-a-slider/ |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> When a player is not throwing, the player's slider shoe can be temporarily rendered non-slippery by using a slip-on gripper. Ordinary athletic shoes may be converted to sliders by using a step-on or slip-on Teflon slider or by applying electrical or gaffer tape directly to the sole or over a piece of cardboard. This arrangement often suits casual or beginning players.\n\nThe ''gripper'' is worn by the thrower on the hack foot during delivery and is designed to grip the ice. It may have a normal athletic shoe sole or a special layer of rubbery material applied to the sole of a thickness to match the sliding shoe. The toe of the hack foot shoe may also have a rubberised coating on the top surface or a flap that hangs over the toe to reduce wear on the top of the shoe as it drags on the ice behind the thrower.\n\n=== Other equipment ===\nOther types of equipment include:\n\n* Curling pants, made to be stretchy to accommodate the curling delivery.\n* A stopwatch to time the stones over a fixed distance to calculate their speed. Stopwatches can be attached either to clothing or the broom.\n* Curling gloves and mittens, to keep the hands warm and improve grip on the broom.{{clear}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Curling Canada Torino 2006.jpg|thumb|At the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], [[Mark Nichols (curler)|Mark Nichols]] from Team Canada delivers a stone while his teammates look on, ready to begin sweeping.

The winner is the team with the highest score after all ends have been completed (see [[#Scoring|Scoring]] below). A game may be conceded if considered unwinnable.\n\nInternational competitive games are generally ten ends, so most of the national championships that send a representative to the World Championships or Olympics also play ten ends. However, there is a movement on the [[World Curling Tour]] to make the games only eight ends.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eight is Great!

If extra ends are required, each team is allowed 10 minutes of playing time to complete its throws and one added 60-second timeout for each extra end. However, the \"thinking time\" system, in which the delivering team's game timer stops as soon as the shooter's rock crosses the t-line during the delivery, is becoming more popular, especially in Canada. This system allows each team 38 minutes per 10 ends, or 30 minutes per 8 ends, to make strategic and tactical decisions, with 4 minutes and 30 seconds an end for extra ends.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curling.ca/about-the-sport-of-curling/getting-started-in-curling/rules-of-curling-for-general-play/ |title=Rules of Curling for General Play |work=Canadian Curling Association |date=October 2014 |accessdate=20 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129140619/http://www.curling.ca/about-the-sport-of-curling/getting-started-in-curling/rules-of-curling-for-general-play/ |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The \"thinking time\" system was implemented after it was recognized that teams playing aggressively (using draws and other low-weight shots which take more time for the stones to come to rest) were essentially being penalized in terms of the time they had available compared to teams which primarily use hits which require far less time per shot.\n\n=== Delivery ===\n{{refimprove section|date=February 2018}}\nThe process of sliding a stone down the sheet is known as the ''delivery''.\n\nThe ''[[Skip (curling)|skip]]'', or the captain of the team, will usually determine the required ''weight'', ''turn'', and ''line'' of the stone. These will be influenced by the tactics at this point in the game, which may involve taking out, blocking or tapping another stone.\n* The ''weight'' of the stone is its velocity, which depends on the leg drive of the delivery rather than the arm.\n* The ''turn'' or ''curl'' is the rotation of the stone, which gives it a curved trajectory.\n* The ''line'' is the direction of the throw ignoring the effect of the ''turn''.\n\nThe skip may communicate the ''weight'', ''turn'', ''line,'' and other tactics by calling or tapping a broom on the ice. In the case of a takeout, guard, or a tap, the skip will indicate the stones involved.\n\nBefore delivery, the running surface of the stone is wiped clean and the path across the ice swept with the broom if necessary, because any dirt on the bottom of a stone or in its path can alter the trajectory and ruin the shot. Intrusion by a foreign object is called a ''pick-up'' or ''pick''.\n\n[[File:hack.jpg|thumb|left|Players must push out of the ''hack'' to deliver their stones. 95% of hacks in use around the world are Marco Hacks, which were invented in the 1980s by [[Marco Ferraro]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20100326/285164354536152 |title=Ferraro's hack innovation remains curling standard |work=Ottawa Citizen |publisher=Pressreader.com |first=Darren |last=DeSaulniers |page=B5 |date=26 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904020234/https://www.pressreader.com/canada/ottawa-citizen/20100326/285164354536152 |archivedate=4 September 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Outdoor curling on Stormont Loch - geograph.org.uk - 1655114.jpg|thumb|right|Outdoor curling on Stormont Loch.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bannerman |first1=Gordon |title=Curling: Stormont Loch hosts outdoor bonspiel |url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/sport/local-sport/curling-stormont-loch-hosts-outdoor-2747742 |accessdate=20 February 2018 |agency=Daily Record |date=11 November 2013}}</ref> The stone is delivered from an iron crampit<ref>{{cite book |last1=Syers |first1=Edgar and Madge |title=The book of winter sports |date=1908 |publisher=Edward Arnold |location=London |page=29 |url=https://archive.org/stream/bookofwinterspor00syer#page/28/mode/2up/search/crampit |accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref> rather than the hack used indoors]]\n\nThe thrower throws from the ''hack''. Another player, usually the skip, is stationed behind the ''button'' to determine the tactics, ''weight'', ''turn'', and ''line'', and the other two may sweep in front of the stone to influence the trajectory (see [[#Sweeping|Sweeping]], below). The players, with the exception of the skip, take turns throwing and sweeping; when one player (e.g., the [[Lead (curling)|lead]]) throws, the players not throwing (the [[Second (curling)|second]] and [[Third (curling)|third]]) sweep. When the skip throws, the third, or vice-skip, takes his role.\n\nThe thrower's ''gripper'' shoe (with the non-slippery sole) is positioned against one of the hacks; for a right-handed curler the right foot is placed against the left hack and vice versa for a left-hander. The thrower, now ''in the hack'', lines the body up with shoulders square to the skip's broom at the far end for ''line''.\n\nThe stone is placed in front of the foot now in the hack. Rising slightly from the hack, the thrower pulls the stone back (some older curlers may actually raise the stone in this backward movement) then lunges smoothly out from the hack pushing the stone ahead while the slider foot is moved in front of the gripper foot, which trails behind. The thrust from this lunge determines the ''weight'' and hence the distance the stone will travel. While not compulsory, most curlers deliver the stone while sliding out from the hack. Balance may be assisted by a broom held in the free hand with the back of the broom down so that it slides. One older writer suggests the player keep \"a basilisk glance\" at the mark.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kerr |first1=John |title=History of curling, Scotland's ain game, and fifty years of the Royal Caledonian Curling Club |date=1890 |publisher=David Douglas |location=Edinburgh |page=402 |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofcurling00kerruoft#page/n433/mode/2up/search/a+basilisk+glance |accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThere are two current types of delivery, the common flat-foot deliver as well as the [[Manitoba tuck]] delivery where the curler slides on the front ball of his foot.<ref name=tuckers>{{cite news |title=Team of 'tuckers' |url=http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/curling/team-of-tuckers-371331851.html |author=Paul Wiecek |publisher=''[[Winnipeg Free Press]]'' |date=7 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308115915/http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/sports/curling/team-of-tuckers-371331851.html |archivedate=8 March 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe stone is released as the thrower approaches the hog line, at which point the ''turn'' is imparted by a slight clockwise or counter-clockwise twist of the handle from around the two or ten o'clock position to the twelve o'clock on release. A typical rate of turn is about {{frac|2|1|2}} rotations before coming to a rest.\n\nThe stone must be released before its front edge crosses the near hog line, and it must clear the far hog line or else be removed from play (''hogged''); an exception is made if a stone fails to come to rest beyond the far hog line after rebounding from a stone in play just past the hog line. The release rule is rarely enforced in club play unless abuse is suspected. However, in major tournaments it is strictly enforced; the \"eye on the hog\" sensor in the stone will indicate whether the stone has been legally thrown or not. The lights on the stone handle will either light up green, indicating that the stone has been legally thrown, or red, in which case the illegally thrown stone will be immediately pulled from play instead of waiting for the stone to come to rest.\n\n=== Sweeping ===\n{{refimprove section|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Olympic Curling, Vancouver 2010 crop sweeping.jpg|thumb|The skip of Team Sweden joins the front end in sweeping a stone into the house at the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver]]\n\nAfter the stone is delivered, its trajectory is still influenced by the two sweepers under instruction from the skip. Sweeping is done for several reasons: to reduce friction underneath the stone, to decrease the amount of curl, and to clean debris from the stone's path.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/why-curlers-sweep-the-ice-2014-2 |title=\"Why Curlers Sweep the Ice\" |publisher=[[Business Insider]] |date=14 February 2014 |accessdate=20 August 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170820010904/http://www.businessinsider.com/why-curlers-sweep-the-ice-2014-2 |archivedate=20 August 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The stones curl more as they slow down, so sweeping early in travel tends to increase distance as well as straighten the path, and sweeping after sideways motion is established can increase the sideways distance. When sweeping, pressure and speed of the brush head are key in slightly increasing the layer of moisture that builds up under the stone.\n\nOne of the basic technical aspects of curling is knowing when to sweep. When the ice in front of the stone is swept, a stone will usually travel both farther and straighter. In some situations, one of the two alterations in path is not desirable. For example, a stone may have too much weight, but require sweeping to prevent curling into a guard. The team must decide which is better: getting by the guard but traveling too far, or hitting the guard.\n\nMuch of the yelling that goes on during a curling game is the skip calling the ''line'' of the shot and the sweepers calling the ''weight''. The skip evaluates the path of the stone and calls to the sweepers to sweep as necessary to maintain the intended track. The sweepers themselves are responsible for judging the weight of the stone, ensuring the length of travel is correct and communicating the weight of the stone back to the skip. Some teams use stopwatch timing, from back line to the nearest hog line as a sweeping aid. Many teams use the ''[[Glossary of curling|Number System]]'' to communicate in which of 10 playable zones it is estimated the stone will stop.\n\nUsually, the two sweepers will be on opposite sides of the stone's path, although depending on which side the sweepers' strengths lie this may not always be the case. Speed and pressure are vital to sweeping. In gripping the broom, one hand should be one third of the way from the top (non-brush end) of the handle while the other hand should be one third of the way from the head of the broom. The angle of the broom to the ice should be so that the most force possible can be exerted on the ice. The precise amount of pressure may vary from relatively light brushing (\"just cleaning\" - to ensure debris will not alter the stone's path) to maximum-pressure scrubbing.\n\nSweeping is allowed anywhere on the ice up to the ''tee line'', as long as it is only for one's own team stones. Once the leading edge of a team stone crosses the tee line only one player may sweep it. Additionally, when a stone crosses the tee line, one player from the other team is allowed to sweep it. This is the only case that a stone may be swept by an opposing team member. In international rules, this player must be the skip; or if the skip is throwing, then the sweeping player must be the third.\n\n=== ''Burning'' a stone ===\nOccasionally, players may accidentally touch a stone with their broom or a body part. This is often referred to as ''burning'' a stone. Players touching a stone in such a manner are expected to call their own infraction as a matter of [[#Good sportsmanship|good sportsmanship]]. Touching a stationary stone when no stones are in motion (there is no delivery in progress) is not an infraction (unless the stationary stone is struck in such a manner that its position is altered), and is a common way for the skip to indicate a stone that is to be taken out.\n\nWhen a stone is touched when stones are in play, the remedies vary<ref name=\"worldcurlingrules\"/><ref name=\"canadiancurlingrules\">{{cite web |url=http://media.curling.ca/contentImages/File/2007-2008%20General%20Rules%20of%20Play.pdf |title=Rules of Curling for General Play |publisher=Canadian Curling Association |date=September 2007 |accessdate=7 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523150948/http://media.curling.ca/contentImages/File/2007-2008%20General%20Rules%20of%20Play.pdf |archivedate=23 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> between placing the stones as they end up after the touch, replacing the stones as they would have been if no stone were touched, or removal of the touched stone from play. In non-officiated league play, the skip of the non-offending team has the final say on where the stones are placed after the infraction.\n\n=== Types of shots ===\n[[File:CurlingLastStone.svg|thumb|Two ways to get the button with the last stone: a draw on the left (outturn for right-handed delivery), and a hit and roll on the right.]]\nMany different types of shots are used to carefully place stones for strategic or tactical reasons; they fall into three fundamental categories as follows:\n\n'''''Guards''''' are thrown in front of the house in the ''free guard zone'', usually to protect the ''shot-rock'' (the stone closest to the button at the time) or to make the opposing team's shot difficult. Guard shots include the ''centre-guard'', on the centreline and the ''corner-guards'' to the left or right sides of the centre line. See ''Free Guard Zone'' below.\n\n'''''Draws''''' are thrown only to reach the house. Draw shots include ''raise'' and ''angle-raise'', ''come-around'', and ''freeze'' shots.\n\n'''''Takeouts''''' are intended to remove stones from play and include the ''peel'', ''hit-and-roll'' and ''double'' shots.\n\nFor a more complete listing, see [[Glossary of curling terms]].\n\n=== Free guard zone ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nUntil five stones have been played (three from the side without hammer, and two from the side with hammer), stones in the ''free guard zone'' (stones left in the area between the hog and tee lines, excluding the house) may not be removed by an opponent's stone, although they can be moved as long as they are not taken out of play. These are known as ''guard rocks''. If a guard rock is removed under this rule, it is placed back in the positions it was in  before the shot was thrown, and the opponent's stone is removed from play and cannot be replayed. This rule is known as the ''five-rock rule'' or the ''free guard zone rule'' (previous versions of the free guard zone rule only limited removing guards from play in the first three or four rocks, known as the \"three-rock rule\" and \"four-rock rule\" respectively).\n\nThis rule, a relatively recent addition to curling, was added in response to a strategy of \"peeling\" opponents' guard stones (knocking them out of play at an angle that caused the shooter's stone to also roll out of play, leaving no stones on the ice). A team in the lead would often employ this strategy during the game. By knocking all stones out, the opponents could at best score one point (if they had the [[Hammer (curling)|hammer]]). Alternatively, the team with the hammer could peel rock after rock, which would blank the end, keeping the last rock advantage for another end. This strategy had developed (mostly in Canada) as ice-makers had become skilled at creating a predictable ice surface and the adoption of brushes allowed greater control over the rock. While a sound strategy, this made for an unexciting game. Observers at the time noted that if two teams equally skilled in the peel game faced each other on good ice, the outcome of the game would be predictable from who won the coin flip to have last rock (or had earned it in the schedule) at the beginning of the game. The 1990 [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]] was considered by many curling fans as boring to watch because of the amount of peeling and the quick adoption of the Free Guard Zone the following year reflected how disliked this aspect of the game had become.\n\nThe free guard zone was originally called the Modified Moncton Rule and was developed from a suggestion made by [[Russ Howard]] for the Moncton 100 cashspiel (with the richest prize ever awarded at the time in a tournament) in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]], in January 1990. \"Howard's Rule\" (later known as the Moncton Rule), used for the tournament and based on a practice drill his team used, had the first four rocks in play unable to be removed no matter where they were at any time during the end. This method of play was altered by restricting the area in which a stone was protected to the free guard zone only for the first four rocks thrown and adopted as a Four-rock Free Guard Zone for international competition shortly after. Canada kept to the traditional rules until a three-rock Free Guard Zone rule was adopted for the 1993\u201394 season. After several years of having the three-rock rule used for the Canadian championships and the winners then having to adjust to the four-rock rule in the World Championships, the [[Canadian Curling Association]] adopted the four-rock Free Guard Zone in the 2002\u20132003 season.\n\nOne strategy that has been developed by curlers in response to the Free Guard Zone ([[Kevin Martin (curler)|Kevin Martin]] from Alberta is one of the best examples) is the \"tick\" game, where a shot is made attempting to knock (tick) the guard to the side, far enough that it is difficult or impossible to use but still remaining in play while the shot itself goes out of play. The effect is functionally identical to peeling the guard but significantly harder, as a shot that hits the guard too hard (knocking it out of play) results in its being replaced, while not hitting it hard enough can result in its still being tactically useful for the opposition. There is also a greater chance that the shot will miss the guard entirely because of the greater accuracy required to make the shot. Because of the difficulty of making this type of shot, only the best teams will normally attempt it, and it does not dominate the game the way the peel formerly did. [[Steve Gould (curler)|Steve Gould]] from Manitoba popularized ticks played across the face. These are easier to make because they impart less speed on the object stone, therefore increasing the chance that it remains in play even if a bigger chunk of it is hit.\n\nWith the tick shot reducing the effectiveness of the four-rock rule, the [[Grand Slam of Curling]] series of bonspiels adopted a five-rock rule in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thegrandslamofcurling.com/curling/what-is-the-five-rock-rule/ |title=What is the five-rock rule? |publisher=Grand Slam of Curling |date=19 September 2017 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref> In 2017, the five-rock rule was adopted by the World Curling Federation and member organizations for official play, beginning in the 2018-19 season.<ref name=\"natpost20180203\">{{cite news |url=https://nationalpost.com/sports/curling/curlings-new-five-rock-free-guard-zone-rule-designed-to-generate-offence |title=Curling's new five-rock free guard zone rule designed to generate offence |work=National Post |first=Murray |last=McCormick |date=3 February 2018 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"curlcan20180615\">{{cite web |url=https://www.curling.ca/blog/2018/06/15/thiessen-blog-five-rock-fgz-a-positive-change-for-curling/ |title=Thiessen Blog: Five-rock FGZ a Positive Change for Curling |publisher=Curling Canada |first=Nolan |last=Thiessen |date=15 June 2018 |accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Hammer === <!-- This section is linked from [[Hammer (disambiguation)]] -->\nLast-rock or last-stone advantage in an end is called the ''hammer''. Before the game, teams typically decide who gets the hammer in the first end either by chance (such as a coin toss), by a \"draw-to-the-button\" contest, where a representative of each team shoots to see who gets closer to the centre of the rings, or, particularly in tournament settings like the Winter Olympics, by a comparison of each team's win-loss record. In all subsequent ends, the hammer belongs to the team that did not score in the preceding end. In the event that neither team scores, the hammer remains with the same team. Naturally, it is easier to score points with the hammer than without; in tournament play, the team with the hammer generally tries to score two or more points. If only one point is possible, the skip will often try to avoid scoring at all in order to retain the hammer until the next end, when two or more points may lie. This is called a ''blank end''. Scoring without the hammer is commonly referred to as ''stealing'', or ''a steal'', and is much more difficult.\n\n=== Strategy ===\n[[File:Curlingdiagram.svg|thumb|upright|Diagram of the play area in curling, showing the four-foot zone, corner guard, and centre line guard]]\n\nCurling is a game of strategy, tactics and skill. The strategy depends on the team's skill, the opponent's skill, the conditions of the ice, the score of the game, how many ends remain and whether the team has last-stone advantage (the ''hammer''). A team may play an end aggressively or defensively. Aggressive playing will put a lot of stones in play by throwing mostly draws; this makes for an exciting game and is very risky but the reward can be very great. Defensive playing will throw a lot of hits preventing a lot of stones in play; this tends to be less exciting and less risky. A good drawing team will usually opt to play aggressively, while a good hitting team will opt to play defensively.\n\nIf a team does not have the hammer in an end, it will opt to try to clog up the four-foot zone in the house to deny the opposing team access to the button. This can be done by throwing \"centre line\" guards in front of the house on the centre line, which can be tapped into the house later or drawn around. If a team has the hammer, they will try to keep this four-foot zone free so that they have access to the button area at all times. A team with the hammer may throw a ''corner guard'' as their first stone of an end placed in front of the house but outside the four-foot zone to utilize the free guard zone. Corner guards are key for a team to score two points in an end, because they can either draw around it later or hit and roll behind it, making the opposing team's shot to remove it more difficult.\n\nIdeally, the strategy in an end for a team with the hammer is to score two points or more. Scoring one point is often a wasted opportunity, as they will then lose last-rock advantage for the next end. If a team cannot score two points, they will often attempt to \"blank an end\" by removing any leftover opposition rocks and rolling out; or, if there are no opposition rocks, just throwing the rock through the house so that no team scores any points, and the team with the hammer can try again the next end to score two or more with it. Generally, a team without the hammer would want to either force the team with the hammer to only one point (so that they can get the hammer back) or \"steal\" the end by scoring one or more points of their own.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 7 Basic Strategy |url=http://www.curlingschool.com/manual2007/Section7.html |website=The Curling Manual |accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the larger the lead a team will have in a game, the more defensively they should play. By hitting all of the opponent's stones, it removes opportunities for their getting multiple points, therefore defending the lead. If the leading team is quite comfortable, leaving their own stones in play can also be dangerous. Guards can be drawn around by the other team, and stones in the house can be tapped back (if they are in front of the tee line) or frozen onto (if they are behind the tee line). A frozen stone is difficult to remove, because it is \"frozen\" (in front of and touching) to the opponents stone. At this point, a team will opt for \"peels\", meaning that the stones they throw will be to not only hit their opposition stones, but to roll out of play as well. Peels are hits that are thrown with the most amount of power.{{clear}}\n\n=== Conceding a game ===\nIt is not uncommon at any level for a losing team to terminate the match before all ends are completed if it believes it no longer has a realistic chance of winning. Competitive games end once the losing team has \"run out of rocks\"\u2014that is, once it has fewer stones in play and available for play than the number of points needed to tie the game.\n\n=== Dispute resolution ===\n[[File:Curling metering.jpg|thumb|Measuring which stone is closest to the centre of the house]]\n\nMost decisions about rules are left to the skips, although in official tournaments, decisions may be left to the officials. However, all scoring disputes are handled by the vice skip. No players other than the vice skip from each team should be in the house while score is being determined. In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than the vice skip is the failure of the vice skips to agree on which stone is closest to the button. An independent official (supervisor at Canadian and World championships) then measures the distances using a specially designed device that pivots at the centre of the button. When no independent officials are available, the vice skips measure the distances.\n\n== Scoring ==\n[[File:curlingscore.jpg|thumb|left|A typical curling scoreboard used at clubs, which use a method of scoring different from the ones used on television]]\nThe winner is the team having the highest number of accumulated points at the completion of ten ends. Points are scored at the conclusion of each of these ends as follows: when each team has thrown its eight stones, the team with the stone closest to the button wins that end; the winning team is then awarded one point for each of its own stones lying closer to the button than the opponent's closest stone.\n\nOnly stones that are ''in the house'' are considered in the scoring. A stone is in the house if it lies within the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} zone or any portion of its edge lies over the edge of the ring. Since the bottom of the stone is rounded, a stone just barely in the house will not have any actual contact with the ring, which will pass under the rounded edge of the stone, but it still counts. This type of stone is known as a ''biter''.\n\nIt may not be obvious to the eye which of two rocks is closer to the button (centre) or if a rock is actually biting or not. There are specialized devices to make these determinations, but these cannot be brought out until after an end is completed. Therefore, a team may make strategic decisions during an end based on assumptions of rock position that turn out to be incorrect.\n\nThe score is marked on a [[scoreboard]], of which there are two types; the baseball type and the club scoreboard.\n\n'''The baseball-style scoreboard''' was created for televised games for audiences not familiar with the club scoreboard. The ''ends'' are marked by columns 1 through 10 (or 11 for the possibility of an extra end to break ties) plus an additional column for the total. Below this are two rows, one for each team, containing the team's score for that end and their total score in the right hand column.\n\n'''The club scoreboard''' is traditional and used in most curling clubs. Scoring on this board only requires the use of (up to) 11 digit cards, whereas with baseball-type scoring an unknown number of multiples of the digits (especially low digits like ''1'') may be needed. The numbered centre row represents all possible accumulated scores, and the numbers placed in the team rows represent the end in which that team achieved that cumulative score. If the red team scores three points in the first end (called a ''three-ender''), then a 1 (indicating the first end) is placed beside the number 3 in the red row. If they score two more in the second end, then a 2 will be placed beside the 5 in the red row, indicating that the red team has five points in total (3+2). This scoreboard works because only one team can get points in an end. However, some confusion may arise if neither team scores points in an end, this is called a ''blank end''.  The blank end numbers are usually listed in the farthest column on the right in the row of the team that has the ''hammer'' (last rock advantage), or on a special spot for blank ends.\n\nThe following example illustrates the difference between the two types. The example illustrates the men's final at the [[Curling at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympics]].\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Baseball-style scoreboard\n|- style=\"background:#ffc; font-weight:bold;\"\n| Team\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 1\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 2\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 3\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 4\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 5\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 6\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 7\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 8\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 9\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 10\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| Final\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| align=\"left\" nowrap| {{CAN}}\n| 0\n| 2\n| 1\n| 1\n| 0\n| 6\n| 0\n| 0\n| x\n| x\n| '''10'''\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| align=\"left\" nowrap| {{FIN}}\n| 2\n| 0\n| 0\n| 0\n| 1\n| 0\n| 0\n| 1\n| x\n| x\n| '''4'''\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Curling club-style scoreboard\n|- style=\"background:#f00;\"\n| align=\"left\" nowrap| {{CAN}}\n|\n| 2\n| 3\n| 4\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 6\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|- style=\"background:#fff; font-weight:bold;\"\n| Points\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 1\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 2\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 3\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 4\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 5\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 6\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 7\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 8\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 9\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 10\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 11\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 12\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 13\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 14\n| style=\"width:12px;\"| 15\n| Blank ends\n|- style=\"background:#add8e6;\"\n| align=\"left\" nowrap| {{FIN}}\n|\n| 1\n| 5\n| 8\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|\n| 7\n|}\n\n</div>\n\nEight points \u2013 all the rocks thrown by one team counting \u2013 is the highest score possible in an end, and is known as an \"[[eight-ender]]\" or \"snowman\". Scoring an eight-ender against a relatively competent team is very difficult; in curling, it is considered the equivalent of pitching a [[perfect game]] in baseball. Probably the best-known snowman came at the 2006 [[Players' Championships]]. Future (2007) World Champion [[Kelly Scott]] scored eight points in one of her games against 1998 World bronze medalist [[Cathy King]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.curlingzone.com/forums/scores/index.php?tournamentgameid=48621&tournamentid=1309 |title=Shooting Percentages |work=CurlingZone |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041440/http://www.curlingzone.com/forums/scores/index.php?tournamentgameid=48621&tournamentid=1309 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC6Dap35B_Y |title=Curling 8 Ender |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=20 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110922092400/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC6Dap35B_Y |archivedate=22 September 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Curling culture ==\n[[File:The Curlers by Sir George Harvey.jpg|thumb|''The Curlers'' (1835) by Sir [[George Harvey (painter)|George Harvey]]]]\n[[File:John George Brown - Curling;--a Scottish Game, at Central Park - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Curling;\u2014a Scottish Game, at [[Central Park]]'' (1862) by [[John George Brown]]]]\n[[File:Charles Martin Hardie - Curling at Carsebreck - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Grand Match|Curling at Carsebreck]]'' (1899) by Charles Martin Hardie]]\n\nCompetition teams are normally named after the skip, for example, Team Martin after skip Kevin Martin. Amateur league players can (and do) creatively name their teams, but when in competition (a bonspiel) the official team will have a standard name.\n\nTop curling championships are typically played by all-male or all-female teams. It is known as [[mixed curling]] when a team consists of two men and two women. For many years, in the absence of world championship or Olympic mixed curling events, national championships (of which the [[Canadian Mixed Curling Championship]] was the most prominent) were the highest-level mixed curling competitions. However, a [[European Mixed Curling Championship]] was inaugurated in 2005, a [[World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship]] was established in 2008, and the European Mixed Championship was replaced with the [[World Mixed Curling Championship]] in 2015. A [[Curling at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Mixed doubles tournament|mixed tournament]] was held at the Olympic level for the first time in [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018]], although it was a doubles tournament, not a four-person.\n\nCurling tournaments may use the [[Schenkel system]] for determining the participants in matches.\n\nCurling is played in many countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom (especially Scotland), the United States, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Finland and Japan, all of which compete in the world championships.\n\nCurling has been depicted by many artists including: [[George Harvey (painter)|George Harvey]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harvey |first1=George |title=The Curlers |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-curlers-210179/view_as/grid/search/keyword:curlers-1543116/page/1 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Harvey |first1=George |title=The Curlers |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-curlers-210171/view_as/grid/search/keyword:curlers-1543116/page/1 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> John Levack,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Levack |first1=John |title=The Curlers at Rawyards |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-curlers-at-rawyards-189706/view_as/grid/search/keyword:curlers-1543116/page/1 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> The Dutch School,<ref>{{cite web |title=Dutch School |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/curling-208735/view_as/grid/search/keyword:curling/page/1 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> Charles Martin Hardie,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hardie |first1=Charles Martin |title=Curling at Carsebreck |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/curling-at-carsebreck-212455/view_as/grid/search/keyword:curling/page/1 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> John Elliot Maguire,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maguire |first1=John Elliot |title=Curling Stone Workshop |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/curling-stone-workshop-183133/view_as/grid/search/keyword:curling/page/1 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> John McGhie,<ref>{{cite web |last1=McGhie |first1=John |title=The Curlers |url=https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-curlers-124756/view_as/grid/search/keyword:curling/page/1 |website=ArtUK |accessdate=15 February 2018}}</ref> and [[John George Brown]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Curling;\u2014a Scottish Game, at Central Park |url=https://www.mfah.org/art/detail/50564 |website=The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston |accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nCurling is particularly popular in Canada. Improvements in ice making and changes in the rules to increase scoring and promote complex strategy have increased the already high popularity of the sport in Canada, and large television audiences watch annual curling telecasts, especially the [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] (the national championship for women), the [[Tim Hortons Brier]] (the national championship for men), and the women's and men's world championships.\n\nDespite the Canadian province of [[Manitoba]]'s small population (ranked 5th of 10 Canadian provinces), Manitoban teams have won the Brier more times than teams from any other province. The Tournament of Hearts and the Brier are contested by [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provincial and territorial]] champions, and the world championships by national champions.\n\nCurling is the provincial sport of Saskatchewan. From there [[Ernie Richardson (curler)|Ernie Richardson]] and his family team dominated Canadian and international curling during the late 1950s and early 1960s and have been considered to be the best male curlers of all time.<ref>{{cite news |publisher=CBC Television |url=http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/curlingrichardsons.html |title=Kings of the World: The Curling Richardsons |date=13 March 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428013412/http://www.cbc.ca/documentaries/curlingrichardsons.html |archivedate=28 April 2007}}</ref> [[Sandra Schmirler]] led her team to the first ever gold medal in women's curling in the [[1998 Winter Olympics]]. When she died two years later from [[cancer]], over 15,000 people attended her funeral, and it was broadcast on national television.\n\n=== Good sportsmanship ===<!-- This section is linked from Curling -->\nMore so than in many other team sports, good sportsmanship, often referred to as the \"Spirit of Curling\", is an integral part of curling. In the United States there was even a theology of curling.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rossiter |first1=S. B |title=Curler's sermons : preached before the Grand National Curling Club |date=1898 |publisher=Bonnell, Silver & Co. |location=New York |url=https://archive.org/stream/curlerssermonspr00ross#page/102/mode/2up/search/praise |accessdate=16 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Spirit of Curling also leads teams to congratulate their opponents for making a good shot, strong sweeping or spectacular form. Perhaps most importantly, the Spirit of Curling dictates that one never cheers mistakes, misses or gaffes by one's opponent (unlike most team sports) and one should not celebrate one's own good shots during the game beyond modest acknowledgement of the shot such as a head nod, fist bump or thumbs-up gesture.  Modest congratulation, however, may be exchanged between winning team members after the match.  On-the-ice celebration is usually reserved for the winners of a major tournament after winning the final game of the championship. It is completely unacceptable to attempt to throw opposing players off their game by way of negative comment, distraction or heckling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcmpcc.ca/web/cccntnt.asp?app=116 |title=Spirit of Curling |publisher=RCMP Curling Club, Ottawa |accessdate=23 March 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517162908/http://www.rcmpcc.ca/web/cccntnt.asp?app=116 |archivedate=17 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA match traditionally begins with players shaking hands with and saying \"good curling\" or \"have a pleasant game\" to each member of the opposing team. It is also traditional in some areas for the winning team to buy the losing team a drink after the game.<ref name=\"besthealth\">{{cite web |url=http://www.besthealthmag.ca/get-healthy/fitness/how-one-woman-fell-in-love-with-curling |title=How one woman fell in love with curling |last=Pearson |first=Patricia |date=March\u2013April 2009 |work=Best Health |accessdate=1 February 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209085048/http://www.besthealthmag.ca/get-healthy/fitness/how-one-woman-fell-in-love-with-curling |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Even at the highest levels of play, players are expected to call their own fouls.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a team to concede a curling match after it believes it no longer has any hope of winning. Concession is an honourable act and does not carry the stigma associated with quitting, and also allows for more socializing. To concede a match, members of the losing team offer congratulatory handshakes to the winning team. Thanks, wishes of future good luck and hugs are usually exchanged between the teams. To continue playing when a team has no realistic chance of winning can be seen as a breach of etiquette.\n\n=== Accessibility in curling ===\n{{Main|Wheelchair curling}}\n[[File:WWHCC 2009 - Team China.jpg|thumb|Team China at WWHCC 2009]]\nCurling has been adapted for wheelchair users and people otherwise unable to throw the stone from the hack. These curlers may use a device known as a \"delivery stick\". The cue holds on to the handle of the stone and is then pushed along by the curler. At the end of delivery, the curler pulls back on the cue, which releases it from the stone.<ref>{{cite web |title=Section 4 - Using a Throwing Device |url=http://www.curlingschool.com/manual2007/Section4.html |website=The Curling School |publisher=Curltech |accessdate=16 December 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116162200/http://www.curlingschool.com/manual2007/Section4.html |archivedate=16 January 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Canadian Curling Association]] ''Rules of Curling'' allows the use of a delivery stick in club play but does not permit it in championships.\n\nThe delivery stick was specifically invented for elderly curlers in Canada in 1999. In early 2016 an international initiative started to allow use of the delivery sticks by players over 60 years of age in World Curling Federation Senior Championships, as well as in any projected Masters (60+) Championship that develops in the future.<ref>World Masters Curling [http://achievementinage.blogspot.co.uk/ World Masters Curling]| {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110055810/http://achievementinage.blogspot.co.uk/ |date=10 January 2016 }}</ref>\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{For|an extensive glossary of terminology|Glossary of curling}}\n\nTerms used to describe the game include:\n\nThe ice in the game may be ''fast (keen)'' or ''slow''. If the ice is keen, a rock will travel farther with a given amount of weight (throwing force) on it. The speed of the ice is measured in seconds. One such measure, known as \"hog-to-hog\" time, is the speed of the stone and is the time in seconds the rock takes from the moment it crosses the near hog line until it crosses the far hog line. If this number is lower, the rock is moving faster, so again low numbers mean more speed. The ice in a match will be somewhat consistent and thus this measure of speed can also be used to measure how far down the ice the rock will travel. Once it is determined that a rock taking (for example) 13 seconds to go from hog line to hog line will stop on the tee line, the curler can know that if the hog-to-hog time is matched by a future stone, that stone will likely stop at approximately the same location. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 16 seconds for guards, 14 seconds for draws, and 8 seconds for peel weight.\n\n''The back line to hog line speed'' is used principally by sweepers to get an initial sense of the weight of a stone. As an example, on keen ice, common times might be 4.0 seconds for guards, 3.8 seconds for draws, 3.2 for normal hit weight, and 2.9 seconds for peel weight. Especially at the club level, this metric can be misleading, due to amateurs sometimes pushing stones on release, causing the stone to travel faster than the back-to-hog speed.\n\n== Champions and major championships ==\n[[File:Worldwomenschampionshiptrophy.JPG|thumb|upright|World Women's Championship trophy]]\n{{col-begin|width=auto}}\n{{col-break}}\n* [[Curling at the Winter Olympics]]\n* [[World Curling Championships]]\n* [[World Junior Curling Championships]]\n* [[World Senior Curling Championships]]\n* [[World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship]]\n* [[European Curling Championships]]\n* [[Continental Cup of Curling]]\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Tim Hortons Brier]]\n* [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts]]\n* [[United States Men's Curling Championship]]\n* [[United States Women's Curling Championship]]\n* [[Canada Cup of Curling]]\n* [[European Mixed Curling Championship]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Notable curling clubs ==\n{{Main|List of curling clubs}}\n\n{{hidden top|border = #aaa solid 1px|titlestyle=text-align: center;|title=Notable curling clubs}}\n* [[Bemidji Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Bemidji, Minnesota]], Home of the 2006 United States Men's & Women's Olympic Curling Teams\n* [[Broomstones Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Wayland, Massachusetts]]\n* [[Chicago Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]\n* [[Dakota Curling Club]] \u2013 Burnsville, Minnesota \u2013 a leading example of the development of new curling clubs on arena ice in the USA\n* [[Detroit Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Ferndale, Michigan]]\n* [[Duluth Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Duluth, Minnesota]] \u2013 Home of the 2018 United States Men's Gold Medal Olympic Curling Team\n* [[Garrison Golf and Curling Club]], Kingston, Ontario\n* [[Grand National Curling Club]] \u2013 Organization in the United States covering clubs on the east coast\n* [[Granite Curling Club (Winnipeg)|Granite Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]]\n* [[Granite Curling Club (Seattle)|Granite Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Seattle, Washington]], the only dedicated curling facility on the west coast of the United States\n* [[Ice Melters Curling Club]] \u2013 [[England]]\n* [[Markinch Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Fife, Scotland]]\n* [[Mayflower Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Halifax, Nova Scotia]]\n* [[Milwaukee Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Mequon, Wisconsin]] \u2014 The oldest curling club in the U.S. \u2013 Since 1845\n* [[Ottawa Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Ottawa, Ontario]]\n* [[Potomac Curling Club]] \u2013 Laurel, [[Maryland]] \u2013 Near Washington, D.C\n* [[Pittsburgh Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] \u2013 Established in 2002\n* [[Plainfield Curling Club]] \u2013 [[South Plainfield, New Jersey|South Plainfield]], [[New Jersey]]\n* [[Rideau Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Ottawa, Ontario]]\n* [[Royal Caledonian Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Scotland]], the official Mother Club of curling\n* [[Royal Montreal Curling Club]] \u2013 [[Montreal, Quebec]], the oldest active athletic club in North America\n* [[Royal City Curling Club]] \u2013 [[New Westminster, British Columbia]]\n* [[Saint Paul Curling Club]] \u2013 [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] \u2013 Founded in 1885.

These plans never materialised mainly due to the [[Great Depression]].\n\nOn 8 October 1938, 49,335 spectators watched Fulham play [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref name=\"ESPN\" /> The reason for this exceptionally large crowd was that the game at Stamford Bridge had suddenly been cancelled and so a lot of people made their way west to the Cottage that afternoon instead. It was the largest attendance ever at Craven Cottage and the record remains today, unlikely to be bettered as it is now an all-seater stadium with currently no room for more than 25,700. During the 1930-60's era, Fulham often averaged over 25,000. However, the official attendances can be considered somewhat dubious in this era as many fans would get in by climbing over the fence from Bishops Park into the Putney End. As at many other grounds, fans would sometimes pay at the turnstiles but not be counted.  This [[Boot money scandal|boot money]] would be given to the players (stuffed in their boots) and would not be counted in the gate money.

It was originally named '''Sturgis Falls''', for the first family who settled the site.  The Sturgis family lived in Sturgis Falls for years until the city was merged with Cedar City, another city on the other side of the Cedar River creating Cedar Falls. The city's founders are honored each year with a week long community-wide celebration named in their honor \u2013 the Sturgis Falls Celebration.<ref>http://www.sturgisfalls.org/history</ref>\n\nBecause of the availability of water power, Cedar Falls developed as a milling and industrial center prior to the Civil War.  The establishment of the Civil War Soldiers' Orphans Home in Cedar Falls changed the direction in which the city developed when, following the war, it became the first building on the campus of the Iowa State Normal School (now the University of Northern Iowa).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.library.uni.edu/collections/special-collections/university-archives/building-histories/central-hall|title=Central Hall|last=|first=|date=|website=www.library.uni.edu|publisher=Rod Library|language=en|access-date=January 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nCedar Falls is located at {{coord|42|31|24|N|92|26|45|W}} (42.523520, \u221292.446402).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|29.61|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|28.75|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/64vfLAeJ2?url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=January 24, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nNatural forest, prairie and wetland areas are found within the city limits at the [[Hartman Reserve Nature Center]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|align=right\n|1870= 3070\n|1880= 3020\n|1890= 3459\n|1900= 5319\n|1910= 5012\n|1920= 6316\n|1930= 7362\n|1940= 9349\n|1950= 14334\n|1960= 21195\n|1970= 29597\n|1980= 36322\n|1990= 34298\n|2000= 36145\n|2010= 39260\n|estyear=2016\n|estimate=41390\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2016\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2016.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=[https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/decennial/ U.S. Decennial Census]<ref name=IADC/>\n}}\nCedar Falls is part of the [[Waterloo-Cedar Falls metropolitan area]].\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the census<ref name =\"FactFinder\">{{cite web|title=American FactFinder|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=May 11, 2012}}</ref> of 2010, there were 39,260 people, 14,608 households, and 8,091 families residing in the city.

On January 17, two Cleveland newspapers (''The Leader'' and ''The Plain Dealer'') reported that Indians had been chosen to replace Naps. ''The Plain Dealer'' said, \"President Somers invited the Cleveland baseball writers to make the selection. The title of Indians was their choice, it having been one of the names applied to the old National League club of Cleveland many years ago.\" When Chief Sockalexis first arrived, baseball in Cleveland suffered an abrupt downturn in fortune.

The team then relocated to Cleveland in 1900 and changed its name to the Cleveland Lake Shores. The Western League itself changed its name to the American League while continuing its minor league status. One of the American League's eight charter franchises, the major league incarnation of the club was founded in Cleveland in [[1901 Major League Baseball season|1901]]. Originally called the Cleveland Bluebirds, the team played in [[League Park]] until moving permanently to [[Cleveland Stadium]] in [[1946 Major League Baseball season|1946]]. At the end of the 2018 season, they had a regular season franchise record of {{Win-loss record|w=9,384|l=8,968}} ({{winpct|9384|8968}}).

The Cleveland Forest Citys baseball team was then re-created. The National League required distinct colors for the 1882 season, so the Cleveland Forest Citys became the [[Cleveland Blues (NL)|Cleveland Blues]].

The fence moved as much as {{convert|15|ft|m|0}} between series opponents. Following the 1947 season, the American League countered with a rule change that fixed the distance of an outfield wall for the duration of a season.  The massive stadium did, however, permit the Indians to set the then record for the largest crowd to see a Major League baseball game.  On October 10, 1948, Game 5 of the [[1948 World Series|World Series]] against the [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] drew over 84,000.

[[Jim Thome]] left after the season, going to the Phillies for a larger contract.\n\nYoung Indians teams finished far out of contention in 2002 and {{MLBy|2003}} under new manager [[Eric Wedge]]. They posted strong offensive numbers in {{MLBy|2004}}, but continued to struggle with a bullpen that blew more than 20 saves. A highlight of the season was a 22\u20130 victory over the [[2004 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] on August 31, one of the worst defeats suffered by the Yankees in team history.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=240831110 |title=Vizquel's six hits tie AL record |accessdate=2008-06-08 |publisher=ESPN |date=2004-08-31}}</ref>\n\nIn early {{MLBy|2005}}, the offense got off to a poor start.

A total of eight Ohio Cup games were played, with the Indians winning six of them. It ended with the start of [[interleague play]] in 1997.

The rivalry intensified when both clubs were moved to the new AL Central in 1994.  During the 1994 season, the two teams challenged for the division title, with the Indians one game back of Chicago when the strike began in August. During a game in Chicago, the White Sox confiscated [[Albert Belle]]'s corked bat, followed by an attempt by Indians pitcher [[Jason Grimsley]] to crawl through the [[Comiskey Park II|Comiskey Park]] clubhouse ceiling to retrieve it.

[[Jan van Riebeeck]]'s arrival on 6 April 1652 established [[Dutch Cape Colony]], the first permanent European settlement in South Africa. Cape Town outgrew its original purpose as the first European outpost at the [[Castle of Good Hope]], becoming the economic and cultural hub of the [[Cape Colony]].

It was later renamed by John II of Portugal as \"Cape of Good Hope\" (Cabo da Boa Esperan\u00e7a) because of the great optimism engendered by the opening of a sea route to India and the East. [[Vasco da Gama]] recorded a sighting of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1497. In the late 16th century, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and English but mainly Portuguese ships regularly stopped over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper and iron with the [[Khoikhoi]] in exchange for fresh meat.\n\nIn 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and other employees of the [[Dutch East India Company]] ({{lang-nl|Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie}}, VOC) were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and the [[Fort de Goede Hoop]] (later replaced by the [[Castle of Good Hope]]). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the authorities to import slaves from [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]]. Many of these became ancestors of the first [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/2009/05/01/coloured-people-of-the-western-cape-have-the-most-diverse-ancestry-in-the-world/ |title=Cape-Slavery-Heritage \" Coloured People of the Western Cape have the most Diverse Ancestry in the World :: iBlog |publisher=Cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |title=Slavery and early colonisation, South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date=22 September 1927 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref> Under Van Riebeeck and his successors as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape, an impressive range of useful plants were introduced to the Cape \u2013 in the process changing the natural environment forever.

Britain captured Cape Town in 1795, but the Cape was returned to the Dutch by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]]. In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Cape Town was permanently ceded to Britain. It became the capital of the newly formed [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s. With expansion came calls for greater independence from Britain, with the Cape attaining [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|its own parliament]] (1854) and a locally accountable Prime Minister (1872).

In 1910, Britain established the [[Union of South Africa]], which unified the Cape Colony with the two defeated Boer Republics and the British [[colony of Natal]]. Cape Town became the legislative capital of the Union, and later of the [[Republic of South Africa]].\n\nIn the 1948 national elections, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] won on a platform of ''[[apartheid]]'' (racial segregation) under the slogan of \"[[swart gevaar]]\". This led to the erosion and eventual abolition of the Cape's multiracial franchise, as well as to the [[Group Areas Act]], which classified all areas according to race. Formerly multi-racial suburbs of Cape Town were either purged of unlawful residents or demolished. The most infamous example of this in Cape Town was [[District Six, Cape Town|District Six]]. After it was declared a whites-only region in 1965, all housing there was demolished and over 60,000 residents were forcibly removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/ess_info/sa_glance/history/districtsix.htm|publisher=SouthAfrica.info|title=Recalling District Six|date=19 August 2003}}</ref> Many of these residents were relocated to the [[Cape Flats]] and Lavender Hill. Under apartheid, the Cape was considered a \"[[Coloured]] labour preference area\", to the exclusion of \"[[Bantu-speaking peoples of South Africa|Bantus]]\", i.e. Africans.\n\nSchool students from Langa, Gugulethu and Nyanga in Cape Town reacted to the news of protests against [[Bantu Education Act, 1953|Bantu Education]] in Soweto in June 1976 and organised gatherings and marches which were met with resistance from the police.

On [[Robben Island]], a former penitentiary island {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=off}} from the city, many famous political prisoners were held for years. In one of the most famous moments marking the end of apartheid, [[Nelson Mandela]] made his first public speech since his imprisonment,  from the balcony of [[Cape Town City Hall]] hours after being released on 11 February 1990. His speech heralded the beginning of a new era for the country, and the first [[South African general election, 1994|democratic election]], was held four years later, on 27 April 1994. Nobel Square in the [[Victoria & Alfred Waterfront]] features statues of South Africa's four [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winners: [[Albert Luthuli]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[F. W. de Klerk]] and [[Nelson Mandela]]. Since 1994, the city has struggled with problems such as [[drugs]], a surge in violent [[drug-related crime]] and more recently gang violence. In the [[Cape Flats]] alone, there are approximately 100,000 people in over 130 different gangs in 2018.

From the 1950s the area became home to people the [[apartheid]] government designated as non-White and has been described by some as 'Apartheid's dumping ground'. Race-based legislation such as the [[Group Areas Act]] and [[pass laws]] either forced non-white people out of more central urban areas designated for white people and into government-built townships in the Flats or made living in the area illegal, forcing many people designated as [[Black people#South Africa|Black]] and Coloured into informal settlements elsewhere in the Flats.\n\nSince then the Flats have been home to much of the population of Greater Cape Town. This area includes the neighbourhoods of [[Mitchell's Plain]], [[Athlone, Cape Town|Athlone]],  [[Elsie's River]], [[Hanover Park, Cape Town|Hanover Park]], [[Bishop Lavis]], [[Manenberg]], [[Strandfontein, Cape Town|Strandfontein]], [[Gugulethu]], [[Nyanga, Cape Town|Nyanga]], [[Langa, Cape Town|Langa]], and [[Khayelitsha]].\n\n=== Helderberg ===\n{{Main|Helderberg}}The Helderberg consists of [[Somerset West]], [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]], [[Gordons Bay]] and a few other towns.

Beaches located on the Atlantic Coast tend to have very cold water due to the [[Benguela current]] which originates from the [[Southern Ocean]], whilst the water at [[False Bay]] beaches may be warmer by up to {{convert|10|C-change|0}} at the same moment due to the influence of the warm [[Agulhas Current|Agulhas current]], and the surface warming effects of the South Easter wind.<ref name=\"CTbeaches\"/> It is a common misconception that False Bay is part of the Indian Ocean, with Cape Point being both the meeting point of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, and the southernmost tip of Africa. The oceans in fact meet at the actual southernmost tip, [[Cape Agulhas]], which lies approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the south east. The misconception is fuelled by the relative warmth of the False Bay water to the Atlantic Seaboard water, and the many confusing instances of \"Two Oceans\" in names synonymous with Cape Town, such as the [[Two Oceans Marathon]], the [[Two Oceans Aquarium]], and places such as Two Oceans wine farm.\n\n[[File:View of Lion's Head from Camps Bay.JPG|thumb|View of [[Lion's Head (Cape Town)|Lion's Head]] from Camps Bay]]\nBoth coasts are equally popular, although the beaches in affluent [[Clifton, Cape Town|Clifton]] and elsewhere on the Atlantic Coast are better developed with restaurants and caf\u00e9s, with a strip of restaurants and bars accessible to the beach at [[Camps Bay]].

The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.\n\n=== Road ===\nCape Town is the origin of three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]]. The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] and [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] begin in the foreshore area near the city centre.\n\nThe N1 runs ENE as a highway through [[Edgemead, Cape Town|Edgemead]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], and [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]]. It connects Cape Town to [[Paarl, Western Cape|Paarl]] and the major cities in the interior - [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville.\n\nThe N2 runs ESE as a highway through [[Rondebosch]], [[Guguletu]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]] to [[Somerset West]]. It becomes a multiple-carriageway at-grade road from the intersection with  the [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] onwards. The N2 continues east along the coast, linking Cape Town to the coastal cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R102 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the suburbs of [[Kuils River]] and [[Eerste River, Western Cape|Eerste River]].\n\nThe [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Edgemead. It runs north, initially as a highway, but becoming an at-grade road from the  intersection with the M5 (Potsdam Rd) onwards. It links Cape Town with the [[Northern Cape Province]] and [[Namibia]].\n\nThere are also a number of two- and three-digit [[Provincial route (South Africa)|regional routes]] linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The  [[R27 road (South Africa)|R27]] originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Table View, Cape Town|Table View]] and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]] and links the City to the West Coast, ending at the town of [[Velddrif]]. The [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] enters the east of the metro from the north, from [[Stellenbosch]]. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]]. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of [[Betty's Bay]] and [[Kleinmond]].\n\nOf the three-digit routes, the [[R300 road (South Africa)|R300]], which is informally known as the ''Cape Flats Freeway'', is a highway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near [[Mitchells Plain]] and the [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The [[R302 road (South Africa)|R302]] runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through [[Durbanville]] leaving the metro to [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]. The [[R304 road (South Africa)|R304]] enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at [[Philadelphia, Western Cape|Philadelphia]] to end at [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] at a junction with the\\s[[R307 road (South Africa)|R307]]. This R307 starts north of [[Koeberg]] from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]. The [[R310 road (South Africa)|R310]] originates from [[Muizenberg]] and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.\n\nCape Town, like most South African cities, uses [[Metropolitan Routes in Cape Town|Metropolitan]] or \"M\" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. However, the [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road.\n\nCape Town suffers from the worst traffic congestion in South Africa.<ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=R750 million to fight traffic in SA\u2019s most congested city|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|accessdate=29 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TomTom congestion Index.png|500px]]\n\n=== Buses ===\n[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services throughout the Cape Town metropolitan area.

This is known as the ''MyCiTi'' service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myciti.org.za/en/home/|title=MyCiTi|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nMyCiTi Phase 1 includes services linking the Airport to the Cape Town inner city, as well as the following areas: [[Bloubergstrand|Blouberg]] / [[Table View]], [[Dunoon, Cape Town|Dunoon]], [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] and [[Melkbosstrand]], [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], Paarden Eiland, [[Century City, Cape Town|Century City]],  [[Salt River, Cape Town|Salt River]] and [[Walmer Estate, Cape Town|Walmer Estate]], and all suburbs of the [[City Bowl]] and [[Cape Town#Atlantic Seaboard|Atlantic Seaboard]] all the way to [[Llandudno, Cape Town|Llandudno]] and [[Hout Bay, Cape Town|Hout Bay]].\n\nThe MyCiTi N2 Express service consists of two routes each linking the Cape Town inner city and [[Khayelitsha]] and [[Mitchells Plain]] on the [[Cape Flats]].\n\nThe service use high floor articulated and standard size buses in dedicated busways, low floor articulated and standard size buses on the N2 Express service, and smaller {{convert|9|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[Optare]] buses in suburban and inner city areas. It offers [[Accessibility#Transportation|universal access]] through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the [[EMV]] compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from 3 mins to 20 mins in peak times to 60 minutes during quiet off-peak periods.\n\n=== Taxis ===\nCape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.\n\nCape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and [[Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]]. There are about one thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre. The larger taxi companies in Cape Town are Excite Taxis, Cabnet and Intercab and single operators are reachable by cellular phone. The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.\n\nMinibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |publisher=CapeTown.org |title=Transport |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184051/http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |archivedate=28 November 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy.

Owner [[William Hulbert]] signed multiple star players, such as pitcher [[Albert Spalding]] and infielders [[Ross Barnes]], [[Deacon White]], and [[Cap Anson|Adrian \"Cap\" Anson]], to join the team prior to the N.L.'s first season. The White Stockings played their home games at [[West Side Grounds]] and quickly established themselves as one of the new league's top teams. Spalding won forty-seven games and Barnes led the league in hitting at .429 as Chicago won the first ever National League [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]], which at the time was the game's top prize.\n\nAfter back-to-back pennants in 1880 and 1881, Hulbert died, and Spalding, who had retired to start [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] sporting goods, assumed ownership of the club. The White Stockings, with Anson acting as player-manager, captured their third consecutive pennant in 1882, and Anson established himself as the game's first true superstar. In 1885 and '86, after winning N.L. pennants, the White Stockings met the champions of the short-lived [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in that era's version of a World Series. Both seasons resulted in matchups with the [[St. Louis Cardinals|St. Louis Brown Stockings]], with the clubs tying in 1885 and with St. Louis winning in 1886. This was the genesis of what would eventually become one of the greatest [[Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry|rivalries]] in sports. In all, the Anson-led Chicago Base Ball Club won six National League pennants between 1876 and 1886. As a result, Chicago's club nickname transitioned, and by [[1890 in baseball|1890]] they had become known as the '''Chicago Colts''',<ref name=\"1890colts\">{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1890.shtml |title = 1890 Chicago Colts |publisher = baseball-reference.com |access-date = August 16, 2008 }}</ref> or sometimes \"Anson's Colts\", referring to Cap's influence within the club.

With Chance acting as player-manager from 1905 to 1912, the Cubs won four pennants and two World Series titles over a five-year span. Although they fell to the \"Hitless Wonders\" White Sox in the [[1906 World Series]], the Cubs recorded a record 116 victories and the [[List of best MLB season records|best winning percentage]] (.763) in Major League history. With mostly the same roster, Chicago won back-to-back World Series championships in [[1907 World Series|1907]] and [[1908 World Series|1908]], becoming the first Major League club to play three times in the Fall Classic and the first to win it twice. However, the Cubs would not win another World Series until [[2016 World Series|2016]]; this remains the longest championship drought in North American professional sports.\n\n[[File:1913 Chicago Cubs.jpg|thumb|right|<div style=\"text-align: center;\">1913 Chicago Cubs</div>]]\nThe next season, veteran catcher [[Johnny Kling]] left the team to become a professional [[pocket billiards]] player. Some historians think Kling's absence was significant enough to prevent the Cubs from also winning a third straight title in 1909, as they finished 6 games out of first place.<ref>{{cite book |title = Three Finger |first = Cindy |last = Thomson |first2 = Scott |last2 = Brown |publisher = University of Nebraska Press |isbn = 0-8032-4448-7 |pages = 88\u201389 }}</ref> When Kling returned the next year, the Cubs won the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] again, but lost to the Philadelphia Athletics in the [[1910 World Series]].\n\nIn 1914, advertising executive [[Albert Lasker]] obtained a large block of the club's shares and before the 1916 season assumed majority ownership of the franchise. Lasker brought in a wealthy partner, [[Charles Weeghman]], the proprietor of a popular chain of lunch counters who had previously owned the [[Chicago Whales]] of the short-lived [[Federal League]]. As principal owners, the pair moved the club from the West Side Grounds to the much newer [[Weeghman Park]], which had been constructed for the Whales only two years earlier, where they remain to this day. The Cubs responded by winning a pennant in the war-shortened season of 1918, where they played a part in [[Curse of the Bambino|another team's curse]]: the [[Boston Red Sox]] defeated [[Grover Cleveland Alexander]]'s Cubs four games to two in the [[1918 World Series]], Boston's last Series championship until 2004.\n\nBeginning in 1916, [[William Wrigley, Jr.|Bill Wrigley]] of chewing-gum fame acquired an increasing quantity of stock in the Cubs. By 1921 he was the majority owner, maintaining that status into the 1930s.\n\nMeanwhile, the year 1919 saw the start of the tenure of [[William Veeck, Sr.|Bill Veeck, Sr.]] as team president. Veeck would hold that post throughout the 1920s and into the 30s. The management team of Wrigley and Veeck came to be known as the \"double-Bills.\"\n\n===The Wrigley years (1921\u20131945)===\n\n====1929\u20131938: Every three years====\n[[File:1920 cub logo.svg|thumb|left|120px|Club logo 1927\u20131936<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sportslogos.net/logos/list_by_team/54 |title = Chicago Cubs Logos }}</ref>]]Near the end of the first decade of the double-Bills' guidance, the Cubs won the NL pennant in 1929 and then achieved the unusual feat of winning a pennant every three years, following up the 1929 flag with league titles in 1932, 1935, and 1938. Unfortunately, their success did not extend to the [[List of baseball jargon (F)|Fall Classic]], as they fell to their [[American League|AL]] rivals each time. The [[1932 World Series|'32 series]] against the [[1932 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] featured Babe Ruth's \"[[Babe Ruth's called shot|called shot]]\" at Wrigley Field in game three. There were some historic moments for the Cubs as well; In 1930, [[Hack Wilson]], one of the top home run hitters in the game, had one of the most impressive seasons in MLB history, hitting 56 home runs and establishing the current runs-batted-in record of 191. That 1930 club, which boasted six eventual hall of fame members (Wilson, [[Gabby Hartnett]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[George Kelly (baseball)|George \"High Pockets\" Kelly]], [[Kiki Cuyler]] and manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]]) established the current team batting average record of .309. In 1935 the Cubs claimed the pennant in thrilling fashion, winning a record 21 games in a row in September. The [[1938 Chicago Cubs season|'38 club]] saw [[Dizzy Dean]] lead the team's pitching staff and provided a historic moment when they won a crucial late-season game at Wrigley Field over the [[1938 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] with a [[walk-off home run]] by Gabby Hartnett, which became known in baseball [[folklore|lore]] as \"[[The Homer in the Gloamin']]\".<ref>{{cite news |first = Marc |last = Zarefsky |title = 'Homer in the Gloamin' most memorable |date = August 8, 2007 |publisher = MLB.com |url = http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/content/printer_friendly/chc/y2007/m07/d20/c2099223.jsp |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAfter the \"double-Bills\" (Wrigley and Veeck) died in 1932 and 1933 respectively, [[P.K.

Due to the wartime travel restrictions, the first three games of the [[1945 World Series]] were played in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Detroit]], where the Cubs won two games, including a one-hitter by [[Claude Passeau]], and the final four were played at Wrigley. The Cubs lost the series, and did not return until the [[2016 World Series]]. After losing the 1945 World Series to the [[Detroit Tigers]], the Cubs finished with a respectable 82-71 record in the following year, but this was only good enough for third place.\n\nIn the following two decades, the Cubs played mostly forgettable baseball, finishing among the worst teams in the National League on an almost annual basis. From 1947 to 1966, they only notched one winning season. Longtime infielder-manager [[Phil Cavarretta]], who had been a key player during the 1945 season, was fired during spring training in 1954 after admitting the team was unlikely to finish above fifth place. Although shortstop [[Ernie Banks]] would become one of the star players in the league during the next decade, finding help for him proved a difficult task, as quality players such as [[Hank Sauer]] were few and far between. This, combined with poor ownership decisions such as the [[College of Coaches]], and the ill-fated trade of future [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] member [[Lou Brock]] to the Cardinals for pitcher [[Ernie Broglio]] (who won only seven games over the next three seasons), hampered on-field performance.\n\n====1969: Fall of '69====\n{{Main article|1969 Chicago Cubs season}}\nThe late-1960s brought hope of a renaissance, with third baseman [[Ron Santo]], pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]], and outfielder [[Billy Williams (left fielder)|Billy Williams]] joining Banks. After losing a dismal 103 games in 1966, the Cubs brought home consecutive winning records in [[1967 Major League Baseball season|'67]] and [[1968 Major League Baseball season|'68]], marking the first time a Cub team had accomplished that feat in over two decades.\n\nIn {{mlby|1969}} the Cubs, managed by [[Leo Durocher]], built a substantial lead in the newly created [[National League East]]ern Division by mid-August. [[Ken Holtzman]] pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 {{frac|1|2}} games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 {{frac|1|2}} games over the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]]. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a two-out, two-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings.[6]\nBurdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1\u20442 game in front. More of the same followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally.\nAfter that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.[1] The Mets (who had lost a record 120 games 7 years earlier), would go on to win the World Series. The Cubs, despite a respectable 92-70 record, would be remembered for having lost a remarkable 17\u00bd games in the standings to the Mets in the last quarter of the season.\n\n====1977\u20131979: June Swoon====\n{{Main article|1977 Chicago Cubs season}}\nFollowing the 1969 season, the club posted winning records for the next few seasons, but no playoff action. After the core players of those teams started to move on, the 70s got worse for the team, and they became known as \"the Loveable Losers.\" In {{mlby|1977}}, the team found some life, but ultimately experienced one of its [https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1977.shtml biggest collapses.] The Cubs hit a high-water mark on June 28 at 47\u201322, boasting an {{frac|8|1|2}} game NL East lead, as they were led by [[Bobby Murcer]] (27 HR/89 RBI), and [[Rick Reuschel]] (20\u201310). However, the [[1977 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] cut the lead to two by the All-star break, as the Cubs sat 19 games over .500, but they swooned late in the season, going 20\u201340 after July 31. The Cubs finished in fourth place at 81\u201381, while Philadelphia surged, finishing with 101 wins. The following two seasons also saw the Cubs get off to a fast start, as the team rallied to over 10 games above .500 well into both seasons, only to again wear down and play poorly later on, and ultimately settling back to mediocrity. This trait became known as the \"June Swoon\". Again, the Cubs' unusually high number of day games is often pointed to as one reason for the team's inconsistent late season play.\n\nWrigley died in 1977. The Wrigley family sold the team to the [[Chicago Tribune]] in 1981, ending a 65-year family relationship with the Cubs.\n\n===Tribune Company years (1981\u20132008)===\n\n====1984: Heartbreak====\n{{Main article|1984 Chicago Cubs season}}\n[[File:Pic of ryne sandberg from the early 90's.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ryne Sandberg set numerous league and club records in his career and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2005.]]After over a dozen more subpar seasons, in 1981 the Cubs hired GM [[Dallas Green (baseball)|Dallas Green]] from Philadelphia to turn around the franchise. Green had managed the 1980 Phillies to the World Series title. One of his early GM moves brought in a young Phillies minor-league 3rd baseman named Ryne Sandberg, along with Larry Bowa for Iv\u00e1n DeJes\u00fas. The 1983 Cubs had finished 71\u201391 under Lee Elia, who was fired before the season ended by Green. Green continued the culture of change and overhauled the Cubs roster, front-office and coaching staff prior to 1984. [[Jim Frey]] was hired to manage the 1984 Cubs, with [[Don Zimmer]] coaching 3rd base and [[Billy Connors]] serving as pitching coach.\n\nGreen shored<ref name=1984Cubs/> up the 1984 roster with a series of transactions. In December, 1983 [[Scott Sanderson (baseball)|Scott Sanderson]] was acquired from Montreal in a three-team deal with San Diego for [[Carmelo Mart\u00ednez]]. Pinch hitter [[Richie Hebner]] (.333 BA in 1984) was signed as a free-agent. In spring training, moves continued: LF [[Gary Matthews]] and CF [[Bobby Dernier]] came from Philadelphia on March 26, for [[Bill Campbell (baseball)|Bill Campbell]] and a minor leaguer. Reliever Tim Stoddard (10\u20136 3.82, 7 saves) was acquired the same day for a minor leaguer; veteran pitcher [[Ferguson Jenkins]] was released.\n\nThe team's commitment to contend was complete when Green made a midseason deal on June 15 to shore up the starting rotation due to injuries to [[Rick Reuschel]] (5\u20135) and Sanderson. The deal brought 1979 NL Rookie of the Year pitcher [[Rick Sutcliffe]] from the Cleveland Indians. [[Joe Carter]] (who was with the Triple-A [[Iowa Cubs]] at the time) and right fielder [[Mel Hall]] were sent to Cleveland for Sutcliffe and back-up catcher Ron Hassey (.333 with Cubs in 1984). Sutcliffe (5\u20135 with the Indians) immediately joined Sanderson (8\u20135 3.14), Eckersley (10\u20138 3.03), [[Steve Trout]] (13\u20137 3.41) and [[Dick Ruthven]] (6\u201310 5.04) in the starting rotation. Sutcliffe proceeded to go 16\u20131 for Cubs and capture the [[Cy Young Award]].<ref name=1984Cubs/>\n\nThe Cubs 1984 starting lineup was very strong.<ref name=1984Cubs/> It consisted of LF Matthews (.291 14\u201382 101 runs 17 SB), C [[Jody Davis (baseball)|Jody Davis]] (.256 19\u201394), RF [[Keith Moreland]] (.279 16\u201380), SS [[Larry Bowa]] (.223 10 SB), 1B [[Leon \"Bull\" Durham]] (.279 23\u201396 16SB), CF Dernier (.278 45 SB), 3B [[Ron Cey]] (.240 25\u201397), Closer [[Lee Smith (baseball)|Lee Smith]](9\u20137 3.65 33 saves) and 1984 NL MVP [[Ryne Sandberg]] (.314 19\u201384 114 runs, 19 triples,32 SB).<ref name=1984Cubs>{{cite web |url = https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1984.shtml |title = 1984 Chicago Cubs Batting, Pitching, & Fielding Statistics |work = Baseball-Reference.com |access-date = August 12, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nReserve players Hebner, [[Thad Bosley]], [[Henry Cotto]], Hassey and [[Dave Owen (baseball)|Dave Owen]] produced exciting moments. The bullpen depth of [[Rich Bordi]], [[George Frazier (pitcher)|George Frazier]], [[Warren Brusstar]] and [[Dickie Noles]] did their job in getting the game to Smith or Stoddard.\n\nAt the top of the order, Dernier and Sandberg were exciting, aptly coined \"the Daily Double\" by [[Harry Caray]]. With strong defense \u2013 Dernier CF and Sandberg 2B, won the NL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove]]- solid pitching and clutch hitting, the Cubs were a well balanced team. Following the \"Daily Double\", Matthews, Durham, Cey, Moreland and Davis gave the Cubs an order with no gaps to pitch around. Sutcliffe anchored a strong top-to-bottom rotation, and Smith was one of the top closers in the game.\n\nThe shift in the Cubs' fortunes was characterized June 23 on the \"NBC Saturday Game of the Week\" contest against the St. Louis Cardinals; it has since been dubbed simply \"[[The Sandberg Game]].\" With the nation watching and Wrigley Field packed, Sandberg emerged as a superstar with not one, but two game-tying home runs against Cardinals closer [[Bruce Sutter]]. With his shots in the 9th and 10th innings Wrigley Field erupted and Sandberg set the stage for a comeback win that cemented the Cubs as the team to beat in the East. No one would catch them.\n\nIn early August the Cubs swept the Mets in a 4-game home series that further distanced them from the pack. An infamous Keith Moreland-[[Ed Lynch (baseball)|Ed Lynch]] fight erupted after Lynch hit Moreland with a pitch, perhaps forgetting Moreland was once a linebacker at the University of Texas. It was the second game of a double header and the Cubs had won the first game in part due to a three run home run by Moreland. After the bench-clearing fight the Cubs won the second game, and the sweep put the Cubs at 68\u201345.\n\nIn 1984, each league had two divisions, East and West. The divisional winners met in a best-of-5 series to advance to the World Series, in a \"2\u20133\" format, first two games were played at the home of the team who did not have home field advantage. Then the last three games were played at the home of the team, with home field advantage. Thus the first two games were played at Wrigley Field and the next three at the home of their opponents, San Diego. A common and unfounded myth is that since Wrigley Field did not have lights at that time the National League decided to give the home field advantage to the winner of the NL West. In fact, home field advantage had rotated between the winners of the East and West since 1969 when the league expanded. In even numbered years, the NL West had home field advantage. In odd numbered years, the NL East had home field advantage. Since the NL East winners had had home field advantage in 1983, the NL West winners were entitled to it.\n\nThe confusion may stem from the fact that Major League Baseball did decide that, should the Cubs make it to the World Series, the American League winner would have home field advantage unless the Cubs hosted home games at an alternate site since the Cubs home field of Wrigley Field did not yet have lights. Rumor was the Cubs could hold home games across town at Comiskey Park, home of the American League's Chicago White Sox. Rather than hold any games in the cross town rival Sox Park, the Cubs made arrangements with the August A. Busch, owner of the St. Louis Cardinals, to use Busch Stadium in St. Louis as the Cubs \"home field\" for the World Series. This was approved by Major League Baseball and would have enabled the Cubs to host games 1 and 2, along with games 6 and 7 if necessary. At the time home field advantage was rotated between each league. Odd numbered years the AL had home field advantage. Even numbered years the NL had home field advantage. In the 1982 World Series the St. Louis Cardinals of the NL had home field advantage. In the 1983 World Series the Baltimore Orioles of the AL had home field advantage.\n\nIn the [[1984 National League Championship Series|NLCS]], the Cubs easily won the first two games at Wrigley Field against the [[1984 San Diego Padres season|San Diego Padres]]. The Padres were the winners of the Western Division with [[Steve Garvey]], [[Tony Gwynn]], [[Eric Show]], [[Goose Gossage]] and [[Alan Wiggins]]. With wins of 13\u20130 and 4\u20132, the Cubs needed to win only one game of the next three in San Diego to make it to the World Series. After being beaten in Game 3 7\u20131, the Cubs lost Game 4 when Smith, with the game tied 5\u20135, allowed a game-winning home run to Garvey in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 5 the Cubs took a 3\u20130 lead into the 6th inning, and a 3\u20132 lead into the seventh with Sutcliffe (who won the [[Cy Young Award]] that year) still on the mound. Then, Leon Durham had a sharp grounder go under his glove. This critical error helped the Padres win the game 6\u20133, with a 4-run 7th inning and keep Chicago out of the [[1984 World Series]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]]. The loss ended a spectacular season for the Cubs, one that brought alive a slumbering franchise and made the Cubs relevant for a whole new generation of Cubs fans.\n\nThe Padres would be defeated in 5 games by Sparky Anderson's Tigers in the World Series.\n\n[[File:Shawon Dunston.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Shawon Dunston was the Cubs shortstop for 10 years.]]The 1985 season brought high hopes. The club started out well, going 35\u201319 through mid-June, but injuries to Sutcliffe and others in the pitching staff contributed to a 13-game losing streak that pushed the Cubs out of contention.\n\n====1989: NL East division championship====\n{{Main article|1989 Chicago Cubs season}}\nIn 1989, the first full season with night baseball at Wrigley Field, [[Don Zimmer]]'s Cubs were led by a core group of veterans in [[Ryne Sandberg]], [[Rick Sutcliffe]] and [[Andre Dawson]], who were boosted by a crop of youngsters such as [[Mark Grace]], [[Shawon Dunston]], [[Greg Maddux]], Rookie of the Year [[Jerome Walton]], and Rookie of the Year Runner-Up Dwight Smith. The Cubs won the NL East once again that season winning 93 games. This time the Cubs met the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the [[1989 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. After splitting the first two games at home, the Cubs headed to the Bay Area, where despite holding a lead at some point in each of the next three games, bullpen meltdowns and managerial blunders ultimately led to three straight losses. The Cubs couldn't overcome the efforts of Will Clark, whose home run off Maddux, just after a managerial visit to the mound, led Maddux to think Clark knew what pitch was coming. Afterward, Maddux would speak into his glove during any mound conversation, beginning what is a norm today. Mark Grace was 11\u201317 in the series with 8 RBI. Eventually, the Giants lost to the \"[[Bash Brothers]]\" and the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the famous \"''[[1989 World Series|Earthquake Series]]''.\"\n\n====1998: Wild card race and home run chase====\n[[File:Howmanyout.JPG|thumb|left|170px|Sammy Sosa was the captain of the Chicago Cubs during his tenure with the team.]]\n{{Main article|1998 Chicago Cubs season|1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase}}\nThe 1998 season would begin on a somber note with the death of legendary broadcaster [[Harry Caray]]. After the retirement of Sandberg and the trade of Dunston, the Cubs had holes to fill, and the signing of [[Henry Rodr\u00edguez (outfielder)|Henry Rodr\u00edguez]] to bat cleanup provided protection for [[Sammy Sosa]] in the lineup, as Rodriguez slugged 31 round-trippers in his first season in Chicago. [[Kevin Tapani]] led the club with a career high 19 wins while [[Rod Beck]] anchored a strong bullpen and [[Mark Grace]] turned in one of his best seasons. The Cubs were swamped by media attention in 1998, and the team's two biggest headliners were Sosa and rookie flamethrower [[Kerry Wood]]. Wood's signature performance was one-hitting the [[1998 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], a game in which he tied the major league record of 20 strikeouts in nine innings. His torrid strikeout numbers earned Wood the nickname ''\"Kid K,\"'' and ultimately earned him the 1998 [[NL Rookie of the Year]] award. Sosa caught fire in June, hitting a major league record 20 home runs in the month, and his home run race with Cardinals slugger [[Mark McGwire]] transformed the pair into international superstars in a matter of weeks. McGwire finished the season with a new major league record of 70 home runs, but Sosa's .308 average and 66 homers earned him the [[National League MVP Award]]. After a down-to-the-wire [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]] chase with the [[1998 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], Chicago and San Francisco ended the regular season tied, and thus squared off in a one-game playoff at Wrigley Field. Third baseman [[Gary Gaetti]] hit the eventual game winning homer in the playoff game. The win propelled the Cubs into the postseason for the first time since 1989 with a 90\u201373 regular season record. Unfortunately, the bats went cold in October, as manager [[Jim Riggleman]]'s club batted .183 and scored only four runs en route to being swept by [[1998 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta]] in the [[1998 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.mlb.com/news/article/3375336|title=1998 marked banner year for Cubs|website=Major League Baseball|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-20}}</ref> The home run chase between Sosa, McGwire and [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] helped professional baseball to bring in a new crop of fans as well as bringing back some fans who had been disillusioned by the [[1994\u201395 Major League Baseball strike|1994 strike]].<ref>{{cite news |title = Sosa discusses future, McGwire's Hall chances |date = December 4, 2006 |publisher = [[ESPN]] |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2683234 |agency = Associated Press |access-date = June 11, 2008 }}</ref> The Cubs retained many players who experienced career years in 1998, but, after a fast start in 1999, they collapsed again (starting with being swept at the hands of the cross-town [[1998 Chicago White Sox season|White Sox]] in mid-June) and finished in the bottom of the division for the next two seasons.\n\n====2001: Playoff push====\n{{Main article|2001 Chicago Cubs season}}\nDespite losing fan favorite Grace to free agency and the lack of production from newcomer [[Todd Hundley]], skipper [[Don Baylor]]'s Cubs put together a good season in 2001.

Apparently handcuffed by the Tribune's bankruptcy and the sale of the club to the Ricketts siblings, led by chairman [[Thomas S.

The Cubs were plagued by injuries in 2009, and were only able to field their Opening Day starting lineup three times the entire season. Third baseman Aramis Ram\u00edrez injured his throwing shoulder in an early May game against the Milwaukee Brewers, sidelining him until early July and forcing journeyman players like [[Mike Fontenot]] and [[Aaron Miles]] into more prominent roles. Additionally, key players like Derrek Lee (who still managed to hit .306 with 35 HR and 111 RBI that season), Alfonso Soriano, and Geovany Soto also nursed nagging injuries. The Cubs posted a winning record (83\u201378) for the third consecutive season, the first time the club had done so since [[1972 Chicago Cubs season|1972]], and a new era of ownership under the Ricketts family was approved by MLB owners in early October.\n\n====2010\u20132014: The decline and rebuild====\n{{Main article|2010 Chicago Cubs season|2011 Chicago Cubs season|2012 Chicago Cubs season|2013 Chicago Cubs season|2014 Chicago Cubs season}}\n[[File:Starlin Castro 09-05-2010.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Starlin Castro during his 2010 rookie season.]]Rookie [[Starlin Castro]] debuted in early May (2010) as the starting shortstop.

In addition, long-time ace Carlos Zambrano was pulled from a game against the White Sox on June 25 after a tirade and shoving match with Derrek Lee, and was suspended indefinitely by Jim Hendry, who called the conduct \"unacceptable.\" On August 22, Lou Piniella, who had already announced his retirement at the end of the season, announced that he would leave the Cubs prematurely to take care of his sick mother.

Although the team had a dismal 2012 season, losing 101 games (the worst record since 1966), it was largely expected. The youth movement ushered in by Epstein and Hoyer began as longtime fan favorite Kerry Wood retired in May, followed by [[Ryan Dempster]] and [[Geovany Soto]] being traded to [[2012 Texas Rangers season|Texas]] at the All-Star break for a group of minor league prospects headlined by [[Christian Villanueva]], but also included little thought of [[Kyle Hendricks]].

It was built in 1914 as '''Weeghman Park''' for the [[Chicago Whales]], a [[Federal League]] baseball team. The Cubs also shared the park with the [[Chicago Bears]] of the NFL for 50 years. The ballpark includes a manual scoreboard, ivy-covered brick walls, and relatively small dimensions.\n\nLocated in Chicago's [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View]] neighborhood, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular block bounded by Clark and Addison Streets and Waveland and Sheffield Avenues. The area surrounding the ballpark is typically referred to as Wrigleyville. There is a dense collection of sports bars and restaurants in the area, most with baseball inspired themes, including Sluggers, Murphy's Bleachers and [[The Cubby Bear]]. Many of the apartment buildings surrounding Wrigley Field on Waveland and Sheffield Avenues have built bleachers on their [[Wrigley Rooftops|rooftops]] for fans to view games and other sell space for advertisement. One building on Sheffield Avenue has a sign atop its roof which says \"Eamus Catuli!\" which is [[Latin]] for \"Let's Go Cubs!\" and another chronicles the time since the last Division title, pennant, and World Series championship. The 00 denotes the 2016 NL Central title, NL pennant, and the World Series championship. On game days, many residents rent out their yards and driveways to people looking for parking spots. The uniqueness of the neighborhood itself has ingrained itself into the culture of the Chicago Cubs as well as the Wrigleyville neighborhood, and has led to being used for concerts and other sporting events, such as the 2010 [[NHL Winter Classic]] between the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] and [[Detroit Red Wings]], as well as a 2010 [[NCAA]] men's football game between the [[Northwestern Wildcats]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini]].\n\nIn 2013, Tom Ricketts and team president Crane Kenney unveiled plans for a five-year, $575 million privately funded renovation of Wrigley Field.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2013/05/01/photos-of-planned-wrigley-renovations-revealed/ |title = Photos Of Planned Wrigley Renovation Revealed |work = CBS Chicago |location = Chicago |publisher = WBBM-TV |date = May 1, 2013 |access-date = July 7, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title = Cubs Hint at Paying for Renovations |first = Ben |last = Strauss |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/baseball/cubs-unveil-wrigley-field-plans-hinting-at-picking-up-tab.html |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = January 20, 2013 |access-date = January 23, 2013 }}</ref> Called the 1060 Project, the proposed plans included vast improvements to the stadium's facade, infrastructure, restrooms, concourses, suites, [[press box]], [[bullpen]]s, and clubhouses, as well as a {{convert|6,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}}t [[jumbotron]] to be added in the left field bleachers, [[Batting cage|batting tunnels]], a {{convert|3,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} video board in right field, and, eventually, an adjacent hotel, plaza, and office-retail complex.<ref>{{cite news |title = Selling of Wrigley Field Renovation Plan Begins |first = Paul |last = Sullivan |url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-01-20/sports/chi-wrigley-20130120_1_cubs-plan-wrigley-field-president-crane-kenney |newspaper = [[Chicago Tribune]] |date = January 20, 2013 |access-date = January 23, 2013 }}</ref> In previous years mostly all efforts to conduct any large-scale renovations to the field had been opposed by the city, former mayor [[Richard M.

Wrigley and the 1937 bleacher/scoreboard reconstruction, and prior to modern media saturation, a flag with either a \"W\" or an \"L\" has flown from atop the scoreboard masthead, indicating the day's result(s) when baseball was played at Wrigley. In case of a split [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]], both the \"W\" and \"L\" flags are flown.\n\nPast Cubs media guides show that originally the flags were blue with a white \"W\" and white with a blue \"L\". In 1978, consistent with the dominant colors of the flags, blue and white lights were mounted atop the scoreboard, denoting \"win\" and \"loss\" respectively for the benefit of nighttime passers-by.\n\nThe flags were replaced by 1990, the first year in which the Cubs media guide reports the switch to the now familiar colors of the flags: White with blue \"W\" and blue with white \"L\". In addition to needing to replace the worn-out flags, by then the retired numbers of Banks and Williams were flying on the foul poles, as white with blue numbers; so the \"good\" flag was switched to match that scheme.\n\nThis long-established tradition has evolved to fans carrying the white-with-blue-W flags to both home and away games, and displaying them after a Cub win. The flags have become more and more popular each season since 1998, and are now even sold as T-shirts with the same layout. In 2009, the tradition spilled over to the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] as [[Chicago Blackhawks]] fans adopted a red and black \"W\" flag of their own.\n\nDuring the early and mid-2000s, Chip Caray usually declared that a Cubs win at home meant it was ''\"White flag time at Wrigley!\"''  More recently, the Cubs have promoted the phrase \"Fly the W!\" among fans and on social media.\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/mets/index.ssf/2015/10/celebrities_mets_players_go_crazy_on_twitter_after.html|title=Mets' Noah Syndergaard mocks Cubs' 'Fly the W' on Twitter after NLCS win|last=Curtis|first=Charles|publisher=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=2015-10-22}}</ref>\n\n=== Mascots ===\n[[File:Clark-the-Cub-01.jpg|thumb|right|Clark (left) with the Oriole Bird]]\n{{See also|Clark (mascot)}}\nThe official Cubs team [[mascot]] is a young bear cub, named [[Clark (mascot)|Clark]], described by the team's press release as a young and friendly Cub.

There is no record of whether or not he was just a fan in a costume or employed by the club.  Through the 2013 season, there were \"Cubbie-bear\" mascots outside of Wrigley on game day, but none were employed by the team. They pose for pictures with fans for tips. The most notable of these was \"Billy Cub\" who worked outside of the stadium for over six years until July 2013, when the club asked him to stop. Billy Cub, who is played by fan John Paul Weier, had unsuccessfully petitioned the team to become the official mascot.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=9181458 |title = Chicago Cubs tell unofficial 'Billy Cub' mascot to stop &#124; abc7chicago.com |publisher = Abclocal.go.com |date = 2013-07-22 |access-date = August 1, 2014 }}</ref>\n\nAnother unofficial but much more well-known mascot is [[Ronnie Woo Woo|Ronnie \"Woo Woo\" Wickers]]<ref name=A>{{cite news |first = William |last = Hageman |title = A Fan in Winter |work = Chicago Tribune |date = February 27, 2004 }}</ref> who is a longtime fan and local celebrity in the Chicago area.

He is largely allowed to roam the park and interact with fans by Wrigley Field security.\n\n=== Music ===\nDuring the summer of 1969, a Chicago studio group produced a single record called \"Hey Hey! Holy Mackerel! (The Cubs Song)\" whose title and lyrics incorporated the catch-phrases of the respective TV and radio announcers for the Cubs, [[Jack Brickhouse]] and [[Vince Lloyd]]. Several members of the Cubs recorded an album called ''Cub Power'' which contained a cover of the song. The song received a good deal of local airplay that summer, associating it very strongly with that bittersweet season. It was played much less frequently thereafter, although it remained an unofficial Cubs theme song for some years after.\n\nFor many years, Cubs radio broadcasts started with \"It's a Beautiful Day for a Ball Game\" by the Harry Simeone Chorale. In 1979, Roger Bain released a 45 rpm record of his song \"Thanks Mr. Banks\", to honor \"Mr. Cub\" Ernie Banks.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://rogerbaindemo.com/ |title = RogerBaindemo.com |publisher = rogerbaindemo.com |access-date = August 31, 2009 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090529040804/http://rogerbaindemo.com/ |archivedate = May 29, 2009 |df =  }}</ref>\n\nThe song \"[[Go, Cubs, Go|Go, Cubs, Go!]]\" by [[Steve Goodman]] was recorded early in the 1984 season, and was heard frequently during that season. Goodman died in September of that year, four days before the Cubs clinched the National League Eastern Division title, their first title in 39 years. Since 1984, the song started being played from time to time at [[Wrigley Field]]; since 2007, the song has been played over the loudspeakers following each Cubs home victory.\n\n[[The Mountain Goats]] recorded a song entitled \"Cubs in Five\" on its 1995 EP [[Nine Black Poppies]] which refers to the seeming impossibility of the Cubs winning a World Series in both its title and Chorus.\n\nIn 2007, [[Pearl Jam]] frontman [[Eddie Vedder]] composed a song dedicated to the team called \"[[All the Way (Eddie Vedder song)|All the Way]]\".

The poem is presented as a single, rueful stanza from the point of view of a [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]] fan seeing the talented Chicago Cubs infield of [[shortstop]] [[Joe Tinker]], [[second baseman]] [[Johnny Evers]], and [[first baseman]] [[Frank Chance]] complete a [[double play]]. The trio began playing together with the Cubs in 1902, and formed a double play combination that lasted through April 1912. The Cubs won the pennant four times between 1906 and 1910, often defeating the Giants en route to the [[World Series]].{{multiple image\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer    = Joe Tinker, Johnny Evers, and Frank Chance are the three Cubs described in the poem.\n | footer_align = center\n\n | image1    = Tinker baseball card.jpg\n | alt1      =\n | width1    = 75\n\n | image2    = Evers baseball card.jpg\n | alt2      =\n | width2    = 75\n\n | image3    = Frank Chance Baseball Card.jpg\n | alt3      =\n | width3    = 75\n}}\n<blockquote>\n:These are the saddest of possible words:\n:\"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\"\n:Trio of bear cubs, and fleeter than birds,\n:Tinker and Evers and Chance.\n:Ruthlessly pricking our gonfalon bubble,\n:Making a Giant hit into a double \u2013\n:Words that are heavy with nothing but trouble:\n:\"Tinker to Evers to Chance.\"\n</blockquote>\n\nThe poem was first published in the ''[[New York Evening Mail]]'' on July 12, 1912. Popular among [[sportswriter]]s, numerous additional verses were written. The poem gave Tinker, Evers, and Chance increased popularity and has been credited with their elections to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1946.\n\n== Playoffs/Championships ==\n{{See

The park seats 15,000, making it Major League baseball's largest spring training facility by capacity. The Cubs annually sell out most of their games both at home and on the road. Before Sloan Park opened in 2014, the team played games at [[HoHoKam Park]] \u2013 Dwight Patterson Field from 1979. \"HoHoKam\" is literally translated from Native American as \"those who vanished.\" The North Siders have called Mesa their spring home for most seasons since 1952.\n\nIn addition to Mesa, the club has held spring training in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] (1886, 1896\u20131900), (1909\u20131910) [[Sports in New Orleans#Baseball|New Orleans]] (1870, 1907, 1911\u20131912); [[Champaign, Illinois]] (1901\u201302, 1906); Los Angeles (1903\u201304, 1948\u20131949), [[Santa Monica, California]] (1905); [[French Lick, Indiana]] (1908, 1943\u20131945); [[Tampa, Florida]] (1913\u20131916); [[Pasadena, California]] (1917\u20131921); [[Santa Catalina Island, California]] (1922\u20131942, 1946\u20131947, 1950\u20131951); Rendezvous Park in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] (1952\u20131965); [[Blair Field]] in [[Long Beach, California]] (1966); and [[Scottsdale, Arizona]] (1967\u20131978).\n\nThe curious location on Catalina Island stemmed from Cubs owner William Wrigley Jr.'s then-majority interest in the island in 1919. Wrigley constructed a ballpark on the island to house the Cubs in spring training: it was built to the same dimensions as Wrigley Field.

More also DJed on [[pirate radio]], hosting the ''Meltdown Show'' on [[Kiss 100 London|Kiss FM]] and worked at the Reckless Records store on [[Berwick Street]], [[London]] where Black visited as a customer. The first collaboration between the two artists was \"[[Say Kids What Time Is It?]]\" on a [[white label]] in January 1987, which mixed [[Jungle Book]]'s \"King of the Swingers\" with the break from [[James Brown]]'s \"Funky Drummer\". The innovation of \"Say Kids...\" caused More and Black to be heralded by SPIN as \"the first Brit artists to really get hip-hop's class-cutup aesthetic\".<ref>{{cite book |title=SPIN |url=https://books.google.com/?id=X1aghtVf0GEC&pg=PA48&dq=coldcut+%22Say+Kids+What+Time+Is+It%3F%22&q=coldcut+%22Say+Kids+What+Time+Is+It%3F%22#v=snippet&q=coldcut%20%22Say%20Kids%20What%20Time%20Is%20It%3F%22&f=false |date= December 1996 |last=Media |first1=Spin L.L.C. }}</ref> It is regarded as the UK's first breaks record,<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">{{cite book |title= All Music Guide to Electronica: The Definitive Guide to Electronic Music |url= https://books.google.com/?id=GJNXLSBlL7IC&pg=PT50&dq=coldcut+%22solid+steel%22+kiss&q=coldcut+%22solid+steel%22+kiss#v=snippet&q=coldcut%20%22solid%20steel%22%20kiss&f=false |agency=2001 |isbn= 9780879306281 |author1= Bogdanov |first1=Vladimir |year=2001}}</ref> the first UK record to be built entirely of samples<ref>{{cite book |title=Brit Cult: An A-z of British Pop Culture |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9FwsAAAAYAAJ&q=coldcut+%22Doctorin%27+the+House%22&dq=coldcut+%22Doctorin%27+the+House%22 |agency=2001 |isbn= 9780809293247 |author1=Calcutt |first1=Andrew |year=2001}}</ref> and \"the final link in the chain connecting European collage-experiment with the dance-remix-scratch edit\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Invisible jukebox |url= https://books.google.com/?id=7xPmAAAAMAAJ&q=coldcut+%22queen+latifah%22&dq=coldcut+%22queen+latifah%22|accessdate=26 November 2013 |author1= Herrington |first1=Tony |year=1998}}</ref> This was later sampled in \"[[Pump Up the Volume (song)|Pump Up the Volume]]\" by [[MARRS]], a single that reached #1 in the UK in October 1987.\n\nThough Black had joined Kiss FM with his own mix-based show, the pair eventually joined forces on its own show later in 1987 called ''[[Solid Steel]]''. The eclectic show became a unifying force in underground experimental electronic music<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/> and is still running, celebrating 25 years in 2013.\n\nThe duo adopted the name \"Coldcut\" and set up a record label called Ahead Of Our Time to release the single \"[[Beats + Pieces]]\" (one of the formats also included \"That Greedy Beat\") in 1987. All of these tracks were assembled using cassette pause button edits and later spliced tape edits that would sometimes run \"all over the room\". The duo used sampling from [[Led Zeppelin]] to [[James Brown]]. Electronic act [[The Chemical Brothers]] have described \"Beats + Pieces\" as the \"first [[bigbeat]] record\", a style which appeared in the mid-1990s.\n\nColdcut's first mainstream success came when Julian Palmer from [[Island Records]] asked them to remix [[Eric B. & Rakim]]'s \"[[Paid in Full (Eric B. & Rakim song)|Paid in Full]]\". Released in October 1987, the landmark remix <ref>{{cite web |title= After 200bpm, your heart blows up |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jan/18/popandrock |work= The Guardian |accessdate= 18 January 2006}}</ref> is said to have \"laid the groundwork for hip hop's entry into the UK mainstream\",<ref>{{cite book |title= Invisible jukebox |url= https://books.google.com/?id=7xPmAAAAMAAJ&q=coldcut+%22queen+latifah%22&dq=coldcut+%22queen+latifah%22 |agency=1998 |author1=Herrington |first1=Tony |year=1998}}</ref> becoming a breakthrough hit for Eric B & Rakim outside the U.S., reaching #15 in the UK <ref>[[Eric B. & Rakim discography]]</ref> and the top 20 in a number of European countries. It featured a prominent [[Ofra Haza]] sample and many other vocal cut ups as well as a looped rhythm which later, when speeded up, proved popular in the [[breakbeat|Breakbeat genre]]. Off the back of its success in clubs, the Coldcut \"Seven Minutes of Madness\" remix ended up being promoted as the single in the UK.\n\nIn 1988, More and Black formed [[Hex (VJ group)|Hex]], a self-titled \"multimedia pop group\", with Mile Visman and Rob Pepperell. While working on videos for artists such as [[Kevin Saunderson]], Queen Latifah and [[Spiritualized]], Hex's collaborative work went on to incorporate 3D modelling, punk video art, and algorithmic visuals on desktop machines. The video for Coldcut's 'Christmas Break' in 1989 is arguably one of the first pop promos produced entirely on microcomputers.\n\nIn 1988, Coldcut released ''Out To Lunch With Ahead Of Our Time'', a double LP of Coldcut productions and re-cuts, and the various aliases under which the duo had recorded. This continued the duo's tradition of releasing limited available vinyl.<ref>{{cite book |title= Blues & Soul |url= https://books.google.com/?id=ui9LAAAAYAAJ&q=%22Out+To+Lunch+With+Ahead+Of+Our+Time%22&dq=%22Out+To+Lunch+With+Ahead+Of+Our+Time%22 |agency=1988 |date=June 1988 }}</ref>\n\nThe next Coldcut single, released in February 1988, moved towards a more house-influenced style.<ref>{{cite book |title= Last Night a Dj Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Np3dpRhTsxQC&pg=PA350&dq=coldcut+yazz&q=coldcut+yazz |agency= 1999}}</ref> \"[[Doctorin' the House]]\", which debuted singer [[Yazz]],<ref name=\"http\">{{cite book|title=The Guinness who's who of rap, dance & techno |url= https://books.google.com/?id=kmgZAQAAIAAJ&q=coldcut+yazz&dq=coldcut+yazz |agency=1994}}</ref> became a top ten hit, and peaked at #6.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Ultimate 80's Music Book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=pjLy95O2ILYC&pg=PA62&dq=coldcut+yazz&q=coldcut+yazz#v=snippet&q=coldcut%20yazz&f=false|accessdate=2008}}</ref> In the same year, under the guise Yazz and the Plastic Population, they produced \"[[The Only Way Is Up]]\", a cover of a [[Northern Soul]] song.

''What's That Noise?'' reached the Top 20 in the UK and was certified Silver.\n\n===1990s===\n\nColdcut's second album, ''Some Like It Cold'', released in 1990 on Ahead Of Our Time, featured a collaboration with [[Queen Latifah]] on the single \"Find a Way\". Though \"Find a Way\" was a minor hit in the UK, no more singles were released from the album. The duo was given the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]] \"Producer of the Year Award\" in 1990. Hex - alongside some other London visual experimenters such as iE - produced a series of videos for a longform [[VHS]] version of the album. This continued Coldcut and Hex's pioneering of the use of [[microcomputers]] to synthesize electronic music visuals.\n\nAfter their success with Lisa Stansfield, Coldcut signed with her label, [[Arista Records|Arista]]. Conflicts arose with the major label, as Coldcut's \"vision extended beyond the formulae of house and techno\" and mainstream pop culture (CITATION: The Virgin Encyclopedia Of Nineties Music, 2000). Eventually, the duo's album [[Philosophy (album)|Philosophy]] emerged in 1993. Singles \"Dreamer\" and \"[[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|Autumn Leaves]]\" (1994) sung by vocalist Janis Alexander were both minor hits but the album did not chart.\n\n\"Autumn Leaves\" had strings recorded at [[Abbey Road]], with a 30-piece string section and an arrangement by film composer [[Ed Shearmur]]. The leader of the string section was [[Simon Jeffes]] of [[Penguin Cafe Orchestra]]. Coldcut's insistence on their friend [[Mixmaster Morris]] to remix \"Autumn Leaves\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Larkin |first=Colin |title= The Virgin encyclopedia of nineties music |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=crs7AQAAIAAJ&q=coldcut+%22Some+Like+It+Cold%22&dq=coldcut+%22Some+Like+It+Cold%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cJwpUtelEOO52QXMkoGQDw&redir_esc=y |work=Virgin |agency=2000}}</ref> led to one of Morris' most celebrated remixes,<ref>{{cite book |title= Crossfade: a big chill anthology |url= https://books.google.com/?id=pBcJAQAAMAAJ&q=mixmaster+morris+%22autumn+leaves%22&dq=mixmaster+morris+%22autumn+leaves%22 |accessdate= 15 November 2004}}</ref> which became a minor legend <ref>{{cite book |title= All Music Guide to Electronica: The Definitive Guide to Electronic Music |url= https://books.google.com/?id=GJNXLSBlL7IC&pg=PT50&dq=mixmaster+morris+%22autumn+leaves%22#v=onepage&q=mixmaster%20morris%20%22autumn%20leaves%22&f=false |agency=2001}}</ref> in ambient music. It has appeared on numerous compilations.\n\nIn 1990, whilst on their first tour in Japan (which also featured Norman Cook, who later became [[Fatboy Slim]]), Matt and Jon formed their second [[record label]], [[Ninja Tune]], as a self-titled \"technocoloured escape pod\", and a way to escape the creative control of major labels.<ref>{{cite web |title= Billboard |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vgcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA28&dq=Arista+coldcut&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vbMwUvOtLs6CrQHQYQ&q=Arista+coldcut&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=Arista%20coldcut&f=false |work=Billboard |page=28 |date=7 September 1996}}</ref> The label enabled them to release music under different aliases (e.g. Bogus Order, DJ Food), which also helped them to avoid pigeonholing as producers. Ninja Tune's first release was Bogus Order's \"Zen Brakes\". The name Coldcut stayed with Arista so there were no official Coldcut releases for the next three years.\n\nDuring this time, Coldcut still produced for artists on their new label, releasing a flood of material under different names and continuing to work with young groups.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> They additionally kept on with ''[[Solid Steel]]'' on Kiss FM and running the night club Stealth (Club of the Year in the [[NME]], [[The Face magazine|''The Face'']], and ''[[Mixmag]]'' in 1996).\n\nIn 1991, Hex released their first video game, ''[[Top Banana (video game)|Top Banana]]'', which was included on a Hex release for the [[Commodore CDTV]] machine in 1992, arguably the first complete purpose-designed multimedia system.<ref>{{cite book |last=Cawkell |first=Tony |title= The Multimedia Handbook |url= https://books.google.com/?id=j4JjoLzoJLQC&pg=PA121&dq=Commodore+CDTV+machine#v=onepage&q=Commodore%20CDTV%20machine&f=false |accessdate= 18 May 2004}}</ref> ''Top Banana'' was innovative in that it used sampled graphics, contained an ecological theme and a female lead character (dubbed \"KT\"), and its music changed through random processes. Coldcut and Hex presented this multimedia project as an example of the forthcoming convergence of pop music and computer-game characters.\n\nIn 1992, Hex's first single - \"Global Chaos\" / \"Digital Love Opus 1\" - combined rave visuals with techno and ambient interactive visuals.<ref>{{cite web |title= Billboard |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IA8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA66&dq=Arista+coldcut&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vbMwUvOtLs6CrQHQYQ&q=Arista+coldcut&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=Arista%20coldcut&f=false |work=Billboard |date= 18 January 1997}}</ref>\nIn November of that year, Hex released Global Chaos CDTV, which took advantage of the possibilities of the new CD-ROM medium.

''[[i-D Magazine]]'' was quoted as saying, \"It's like your TV tripping\".\n\nColdcut videos were made for most songs, often by [[Hexstatic]], and used a lot of stock and sampled footage.

Playtime followed on from Coldcut and Hex's Synopticon installation, developing the auto-cutup algorhythm, and using other random processes to generate surprising combinations. Coldcut and Hex performed live using Playtime at the 1st [[S\u00f3nar|Sonar Festival]] in 1994. Playtime was also used to generate the backing track for Coldcut's collaboration with [[Jello Biafra]], \"Every Home a Prison\".\n\nIn 1994 Coldcut and Hex contributed an installation to the [[Glasgow Gallery of Modern Art]]. The piece, called ''Generator'' was installed in the Fire Gallery. ''Generator'' was an interactive installation which allowed users to mix sound, video, text and graphics and make their own audio-visual mix, modelled on the techniques and technology used by Coldcut in clubs and live performance events. It consisted of two consoles: the left controlling how the sounds are played, the right controlling how the images are played.\n\nAs part of the JAM exhibition of \"Style, Music and Media\" at the [[Barbican Art Gallery]] in 1996, Coldcut and Hex were commissioned to produce an interactive audiovisual piece called Synopticon. Conceived and designed by Robert Pepperell and Matt Black, the digital culture synthesiser allows users to \"remix\" sounds, images, text and music in a partially random, partially controlled way.\n\nThe year 1996 also brought the Coldcut name back to More and Black, and the pair celebrated with ''70 Minutes of Madness'', a mix CD that became part of the [[Journeys by DJ]] series. The release was credited with \"bringing to wider attention the sort of freestyle mixing the pair were always known for through their radio show on KISS FM, Solid Steel, and their steady club dates\".<ref>{{cite book|title=All Music Guide to Hip-hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap & Hip-hop|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wr1lmklsD8QC&pg=PT69&dq=Arista+coldcut&q=Arista+coldcut#v=snippet&q=Arista%20coldcut&f=false|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> It was voted \"Best Compilation of All Time\" by [[Jockey Slut]] in 1998.\n\nIn February 1997, they released a double pack single \"Atomic Moog 2000\" / \"Boot the System\", the first Coldcut release on Ninja Tune. This was not eligible for the UK chart because time and format restrictions prevented the inclusion of the \"Natural Rhythm\" video on the CD. In August 1997, a reworking of the early track \"More Beats + Pieces\" gave them their first UK Top 40 hit since 1989.\n\nThe album ''[[Let Us Play!]]'' followed in September and also made the Top 40.

With \"Space Journey\", Coldcut were arguably the first group to give fans access to the multitrack parts, or \"stems\" of their songs, building on the idea of interactivity and sharing from ''Let Us Play''.\n\nIn 2001, Coldcut produced tracks for the [[Sega]] music video game ''[[Rez (video game)|Rez]]''. ''Rez'' replaced typical video-game sound effects with electronic music; the player created sounds and melodies, intended to simulate a form of synesthesia. The soundtrack also featured [[Adam Freeland]] and [[Oval (musical project)|Oval]].\n\nIn 2002, while utilizing VJamm and Detraktor, Coldcut and Juxta remixed [[Herbie Hancock]]'s classic \"[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]\", creating both an audio and video remix.\n\nWorking with Marcus Clements in 2002, Coldcut released the sample manipulation algorhythm from their DJamm software as a standalone VST plugin that could be used in other software, naming it the \"Coldcutter\".\n\nAlso in 2002, Coldcut with UK VJs Headspace (now mainly performing as the VJamm Allstars developed Gridio, an interactive, immersive audio-visual installation for the [[Pompidou Centre]] as part of the \u2018'Sonic Process'' exhibition.<ref>{{cite web |title= Volumes 200-202 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=qEA4AQAAIAAJ&q=coldcut+gridio+pompidou&dq=coldcut+gridio+pompidou&hl=en&sa=X&ei=EdM9Upu6G4KXqAGvsoGgBg&redir_esc=y |work=Blueprint|accessdate= 26 November 2013}}</ref> The ''Sonic Process'' exhibition was launched at the [[MACBA]] in Barcelona in conjunction with [[S\u00f3nar]], featuring Gridio as its centerpiece.

The tribute featured graphic novel writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Bill Drummond]] and a performance by experimental theatre legend [[Ken Campbell]]. Coldcut and Morris' hour and a half performance resembled a documentary being remixed on the fly, cutting up nearly 15 hours' worth of Wilson's lectures.\n\nIn 2008, an international group of party organisers, activists and artists including Coldcut received a grant from the Intelligent Energy Department of the European Union, to create a project that promoted intelligent energy and environmental awareness to the youth of Europe. The result was Energy Union, a piece of VJ cinema, political campaign, music tour, party, art exhibition and social media hub. Energy Union toured 12 EU countries throughout 2009 and 2010, completing 24 events in total. Coldcut created the Energy Union show for the tour, a one-hour Audio/Visual montage on the theme of Intelligent Energy. In presenting new ideas for climate, environmental and energy communication strategies, the Energy Union tour was well received, and reached a widespread audience in cities across the UK, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands, Croatia, Slovenia, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Spain and the Czech Republic.\n\nAlso in 2008, Coldcut was asked to remix the theme song for British cult TV show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' for the program's 40th anniversary.<ref>{{cite book|title=CMJ New Music Report|url=https://books.google.com/?id=B3LxC-059_QC&pg=PA29&dq=coldcut+%22dr+who%22#v=onepage&q=coldcut%20%22dr%20who%22&f=false|accessdate=26 November 2013}}</ref> In October 2008, Coldcut celebrated the legacy of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (the place where the Doctor Who theme was created) with a live DJ mix at London's legendary Roundhouse.

This mix was included on the album ''[[Ayu-mi-x 6: Gold]]''.\n\nStarting in 2009, Matt Black, with musician/artist/coder Paul Miller (creator of the TX Modular Open Source synth), developed Granul8, a new type of visual fx/source Black termed a \"granular video synthesiser\". Granul8 allows the use of realtime VJ techniques including video feedback combined with VDMX [[VJing|VJ]] software.\n\nFrom 2009 onwards, Black has been collaborating with coder and psychedelic mathematician William Rood to create a forthcoming project called Liveloom, a social media AV mixer.\n\n==Recent work==\n\nIn 2010, Coldcut celebrated 20 years of releasing music with its label, Ninja Tune. A book entitled ''Ninja Tune: 20 Years of Beats and Pieces'' was released on 12 August 2010, and an exhibition was held at [[Black Dog Publishing]]'s Black Dog Space in London, showcasing artwork, design and photography from the label's 20-year history. A compilation album was released on 20 September in two formats: a regular version consisting of two 2-disc volumes, and a limited edition which contained six CDs, six 7\" vinyl singles, a hardback copy of the book, a poster and additional items.

The following month, in August, Coldcut produced a new soundtrack for a section of Andr\u00e9 Sauvage's classic film ''\u00c9tudes sur Paris'', which was shown as part of Noise of Art at the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] in London, which celebrated 100 years of electronic music and silent cinema. Coldcut put new music to films from the [[Luigi Russolo|Russolo]] era, incorporating original recordings of Russolo's proto-synths.\n\nIn 2014 Coldcut did 3 soundtracks as part of the project New City, a series of animated skylines of the near future developed by Tomorrow's Thought Today's [[Liam Young]], with accompanying writing from sci-fi authors [[Jeff Noon]], [[Pat Cadigan]] and [[Tim Maughan]].\n\nMost recently, Coldcut released Ninja Jamm, a music making [[App (iPhone)|app]], for Android and iOS, in collaboration with London-based arts and technology firm Seeper.

A cuisine is primarily influenced by the ingredients that are available locally or through trade. [[Religion|Religious]] food laws, such as [[Diet in Hinduism|Hindu]], [[Islamic dietary laws|Islamic]] and [[Kashrut|Jewish dietary laws]], can also exercise a strong influence on cuisine. Regional [[food]] preparation traditions, customs and ingredients often combine to create dishes unique to a particular region.<ref>[http://whatscookingamerica.net/AmericanRegionalFoods/RegionalAmericanIndex.htm \"Rediscover the flavors and traditions of true American cuisine!\"] [http://whatscookingamerica.net Whatscookingamerica.net]. Accessed June 2011.</ref>\n\n==Factors that affect a cuisine==\nSome factors that have an influence on a region's cuisine include the area's [[climate]], the trade among different countries, [[Religious law|religiousness]] or [[sumptuary]] laws and culinary culture exchange. For example, a [[Tropical]] diet may be based more on fruits and vegetables, while a polar diet might rely more on meat and fish.\n\nThe area's climate, in large measure, determines the native foods that are available. In addition, climate influences food preservation. For example, foods preserved for winter consumption by [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]], [[Curing (food preservation)|curing]], and [[pickling]] have remained significant in [[List of cuisines|world cuisines]] for their altered gustatory properties.\n\nThe trade among different countries also largely affects a region's cuisine. Dating back to the ancient spice trade''',''' seasonings such as [[cinnamon]], [[cassia bark|cassia]], [[cardamom]], [[ginger]], and [[turmeric]] were important items of commerce in the earliest evolution of trade. Cinnamon and cassia found their way to the [[Middle East]] at least 4,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/spice-trade|title=spice trade|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=23 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nCertain foods and food preparations are required or proscribed by the religiousness or sumptuary laws, such as Islamic dietary laws and Jewish dietary laws.\n\nCulinary culture exchange is also an important factor for cuisine in many regions: Japan\u2019s first substantial and direct exposure to the West came with the arrival of European missionaries in the second half of the 16th century. At that time, the combination of Spanish and Portuguese game frying techniques with a Chinese method for cooking vegetables in oil led to the development of ''[[tempura]]'', the popular Japanese dish in which seafood and many different types of vegetables are coated with batter and deep fried.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/36JapFoodCulture.pdf|title=web-japan.org/factsheet/en/pdf/36JapFoodCulture.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{further|List of historical cuisines}}\nCuisine dates back to the [[Ancient history|Antiquity]].

In northern Europe, [[wheat]], [[rye]], and fats of animal origin predominate, while in southern Europe [[olive oil]] is ubiquitous and [[rice]] is more prevalent. In Italy the cuisine of the north, featuring [[butter]] and rice, stands in contrast to that of the south, with its wheat [[pasta]] and olive oil.

Throughout the Middle East and Mediterranean there is a common thread marking the use of [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], olive oil, [[lemon]]s, [[chili pepper|peppers]], and rice.

In some parts of the continent, the traditional diet features a preponderance of milk, [[curd]] and [[whey]] products.

Codecs are used in [[Video teleconference|videoconferencing]], [[streaming media]], and [[video editing]] applications.\n\n== Related concepts ==\nIn the mid 20th century, a codec was a device that coded analog signals into digital form using [[pulse-code modulation]] (PCM).  Later, the name was also applied to software for converting between digital signal formats, including [[compander]] functions.\n\nA [[modem]] is a contraction of ''modulator-demodulator''. The [[Telecommunications company|telecommunications industry]] referred to the device as a ''dataset''. It converts digital data from computers to analog signals for transmission over telephone lines. On the receiving end the analog signal is converted back to digital data.\n\nAn [[audio codec]] converts analog audio signals into digital signals for transmission or encodes them for storage. A receiving device converts the digital signals back to analog form using an audio decoder for playback. An example of this are the codecs used in the sound cards of personal computers. A [[video codec]] accomplishes the same task for video signals.\n\n== Compression ==\nIn addition to encoding a signal, a codec may also compress the data to reduce transmission bandwidth or storage space. Compression codecs are classified primarily into ''lossy'' codecs and ''lossless'' codecs.\n\n[[Lossless]] codecs are often used for archiving data in a compressed form while retaining all information present in the original stream. If preserving the original quality of the stream is more important than eliminating the correspondingly larger data sizes, lossless codecs are preferred. This is especially true if the data is to undergo further processing (for example [[editing]]) in which case the repeated application of processing (encoding and decoding) on lossy codecs will degrade the quality of the resulting data such that it is no longer identifiable (visually, audibly or both). Using more than one codec or encoding scheme successively can also degrade quality significantly. The decreasing cost of storage capacity and network bandwidth has a tendency to reduce the need for lossy codecs for some media.\n\nMany popular codecs are [[lossy]]. They reduce quality in order to maximize compression. Often, this type of compression is virtually indistinguishable from the original uncompressed sound or images, depending on the codec and the settings used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Audio quality of aac vs. mp3 vs. wma vs. ogg encoders |publisher=SoundExpert |url=http://soundexpert.org/ |accessdate=2010-07-25 |quote=above 5.0 \u2013 all sound artifacts will be beyond threshold of human perception with corresponding perception margin}}</ref> Smaller data sets ease the strain on relatively expensive storage sub-systems such as [[non-volatile memory]] and [[hard disk]], as well as [[write once read many|write-once-read-many]] formats such as [[CD-ROM]], [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]]. Lower data rates also reduce cost and improve performance when the data is transmitted.\n\n=== Media codecs ===\nTwo principal techniques are used in codecs, [[pulse-code modulation]] and [[delta modulation]]. Codecs are often designed to emphasize certain aspects of the media to be encoded.  For example, a digital video (using a [[DV]] codec) of a sports event needs to encode motion well but not necessarily exact colors, while a video of an art exhibit needs to encode color and surface texture well.\n\nAudio codecs for cell phones need to have very low [[Latency (audio)|latency]] between source encoding and playback. In contrast, audio codecs for recording or broadcast can use high-latency [[audio compression (data)|audio compression]] techniques to achieve higher fidelity at a lower bit-rate.\n\nThere are thousands of audio and video codecs, ranging in cost from free to hundreds of dollars or more. This variety of codecs can create compatibility and obsolescence issues. The impact is lessened for older formats, for which free or nearly-free codecs have existed for a long time. The older formats are often ill-suited to modern applications, however, such as playback in small portable devices. For example, raw uncompressed [[PCM audio]] (44.1&nbsp;kHz, 16 bit stereo, as represented on an audio CD or in a .wav or .aiff file) has long been a standard across multiple platforms, but its transmission over networks is slow and expensive compared with more modern compressed formats, such as [[Opus (audio format)|Opus]] and [[MP3]].\n\nMany [[multimedia]] data streams contain both [[Sound|audio]] and [[video]], and often some metadata that permit synchronization of audio and video. Each of these three streams may be handled by different programs, processes, or hardware; but for the multimedia data streams to be useful in stored or transmitted form, they must be encapsulated together in a [[container format (digital)|container format]].\n\nLower [[bitrate]] codecs allow more users, but they also have more distortion. Beyond the initial increase in distortion, lower bit rate codecs also achieve their lower bit rates by using more complex algorithms that make certain assumptions, such as those about the media and the packet loss rate. Other codecs may not make those same assumptions. When a user with a low bitrate codec talks to a user with another codec, additional distortion is introduced by each transcoding.\n\n[[Audio Video Interleave|AVI]] is sometimes erroneously described as a codec, but AVI is actually a [[container format (digital)|container format]], while a codec is a software or hardware tool that encodes or decodes audio or video into or from some audio or video format. Audio and video encoded with many codecs might be put into an AVI container, although AVI is not an [[ISO standard]]. There are also other well-known container formats, such as [[Ogg]], [[Advanced Systems Format|ASF]], [[QuickTime]], [[RealMedia]], [[Matroska]], and [[DivX#DivX Media Format .28DMF.29|DivX Media Format]]. Some container formats which are ISO standards are [[MPEG transport stream]], [[MPEG program stream]], [[MP4]] and [[ISO base media file format]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Data/file types|Datatypes (Amiga)]]\n* [[Audio signal processing]]\n* [[Digital signal processing]]\n* [[List of codecs]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Lossless data compression]]\n* [[Lossy compression]]\n* [[List of open source codecs]]\n* [[Transcoding]]\n* [[Video coding]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n=== Comparisons ===\n* [[Comparison of container formats]]\n* [[Comparison of audio coding formats]]\n* [[Comparison of video codecs]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Compression Methods}}\n{{Media player (application software)}}\n{{Audio broadcasting}}\n\n[[Category:Codecs| ]]\n[[Category:Digital signal processing]]\n[[Category:Portmanteaus]]", "sha1": "gacca72s4w4qgst81vvm8mv2z21q167"}}, {"title": "Clyde Tombaugh", "ns": "0", "id": "6663", "revision": {"id": "866520284", "parentid": "866386399", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T20:59:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ruslik0", "id": "1130897"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/73.175.16.214|73.175.16.214]] ([[User talk:73.175.16.214|talk]]) to last version by 73.73.187.99", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Tombaugh}}\n{{Infobox person\n| image             = Clyde W.

He then used a [[blink comparator]] to compare the different images. When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930,<ref name=\"colenc\">{{cite book|last1=|first1=|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia 6th Ed |year=2015|publisher=The Columbia University Press|location=|pages=|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1E1-Tombaugh/tombaugh-clyde-william|accessdate=24 February 2016|subscription=yes|via=[[Questia]]|isbn=}}</ref> using images taken the previous month.<ref>[http://www.kshs.org/portraits/tombaugh_clyde.htm Kansas State Historical Society portrait]</ref> The name \"Pluto\" was suggested by an 11-year-old [[England|English]] schoolgirl, [[Venetia Burney]]. It won out over numerous other suggestions because it was the name of the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Pluto (god)|god of the underworld]], who was able to render himself invisible, and because [[Percival Lowell]]'s initials PL formed the first 2 letters. The name Pluto was officially adopted on May 1, 1930.\n<!--[[File:Pluto discovery plates.png|thumb|The photographic plates that were used to discover [[Pluto]] at [[apparent magnitude]] +15.4]]-->\nFollowing the discovery, starting in the 1990s, of other [[Kuiper belt]] objects, Pluto began to be seen not as a planet orbiting alone at 40 [[Astronomical unit|AU]], but as the largest of a group of icy bodies in that region of space. After it was shown that at least [[Eris (dwarf planet)|one such body]] was more massive than Pluto, on August 24, 2006 the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) reclassified Pluto, grouping it with two similarly sized \"[[dwarf planet]]s\" rather than with the eight \"[[classical planets]]\".\n\nTombaugh's widow Patricia stated after the IAU's decision that while Clyde may have been disappointed with the change, since he had resisted attempts to remove Pluto's planetary status in his lifetime, he would have accepted the decision now if he were alive. She noted that he \"was a scientist.

On August 20, 1949, Tombaugh saw several unidentified objects near [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]]. He described them as six to eight rectangular lights, stating: \"I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, because... nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since... I was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was really petrified with astonishment.\".<ref name=\"Waring2010\">{{cite book|author=Scott C.

He never supported the interpretation as a spaceship that has often been attributed to him.  He considered other possibilities, with a temperature inversion as the most likely cause.<ref>''The World of Flying Saucers: A scientific examination of a major myth of the space age'', by [[Donald H. Menzel]] and Lyle G. Boyd, 1963, Doubleday, pp. 266-70.</ref><blockquote>From my own studies of the solar system I cannot entertain any serious possibility for intelligent life on other planets, not even for Mars... The logistics of visitations from planets revolving around the nearer stars is staggering.  In consideration of the hundreds of millions of years in the geologic time scale when such visits may have possibly occurred, the odds of a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly against such an event.</blockquote><blockquote>\nA much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sightings the faintness of the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it traveled away from the zenith towards the southeastern horizon, is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in refractive index, as in an inversion layer.</blockquote><blockquote>\nI have never seen anything like it before or since, and I have spent a lot of time where the night sky could be seen well.  This suggests that the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an interstellar visitation.</blockquote>\n\nAnother sighting by Tombaugh a year or two later while at a White Sands observatory was of an object of &minus;6 magnitude, four times brighter than Venus at its brightest, going from the zenith to the southern horizon in about 3 seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as in Tombaugh's first sighting.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Brad|title=Project Blue Book|publisher=Ballantine Books|date=1976|page=280|isbn=0-345-34525-8}}</ref>\n\nTombaugh later reported having seen three of the mysterious [[green fireballs]], which suddenly appeared over New Mexico in late 1948 and continued at least through the early 1950s. A researcher on [[Green fireballs#Project Twinkle|Project Twinkle]] reported that Tombaugh \"... never observed an unexplainable aerial object despite his continuous and extensive observations of the sky.\"<ref>[http://www.project1947.com/gfb/twinklereport.htm Final report of Project Twinkle]</ref>\n\nAccording to an entry in \"UFO updates\", Tombaugh said: \"I have seen three objects in the last seven years which defied any explanation of known phenomenon, such as Venus, atmospheric optic, meteors or planes. I am a professional, highly skilled, professional astronomer. In addition I have seen three green fireballs which were unusual in behavior from normal green fireballs...

Races on these worlds may have been able to utilize the tremendous amounts of power required to bridge the space between the stars...\" Tombaugh stated that he had observed celestial phenomena which he could not explain, but had seen none personally since 1951 or 1952. \"These things, which do appear to be directed, are unlike any other phenomena I ever observed. Their apparent lack of obedience to the ordinary laws of celestial motion gives credence.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Jerry|title=UFO Encyclopedia|volume=2|publisher=|date=1997|page=896}}</ref>\n\nIn 1949, Tombaugh had also told the Naval missile director at [[White Sands Missile Range]], Commander Robert McLaughlin, that he had seen a bright flash on Mars on August 27, 1941, which he now attributed to an atomic blast.<ref>{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Robert|title=Letter from Robert McLaughlin to James Van Allen|publisher=Roswell Proof|date=1949-05-12|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/McLaughlin_Van_Allen_letter.html|accessdate=2007-02-28}}</ref> Tombaugh also noted that the first atomic bomb tested in New Mexico would have lit up the dark side of the Earth like a neon sign and that Mars was coincidentally quite close at the time, the implication apparently being that the atomic test would have been visible from Mars.\n\nIn June 1952, Dr. [[J. Allen Hynek]], an astronomer acting as a scientific consultant to the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]] UFO study, secretly conducted a survey of fellow astronomers on UFO sightings and attitudes while attending an astronomy convention. Tombaugh and four other astronomers, including Dr. [[Lincoln LaPaz]] of the University of New Mexico, told Hynek about their sightings. Tombaugh also told Hynek that his telescopes were at the Air Force's disposal for taking photos of UFOs, if he was properly alerted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Steiger|first=Brad|title=Project Blue Book|publisher=Ballantine Books|date=1976|pages=268\u201385|isbn=0-345-34525-8}}</ref>\n\n==Near-Earth satellite search==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Tombaugh Lapaz 3 3 1954.jpg|thumb|Clyde Tombaugh (left) discussing search for near-Earth satellites with [[Lincoln LaPaz]] (right), March 3, 1954.

Another public statement was made on the search in March 1954, emphasizing the rationale that such an orbiting object would serve as a natural [[space station]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Armed Forces Seeks \"Steppingstone to Stars\"|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|pages=|date=1954-03-04|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_LATimes_SciNL_1954.html}}</ref> However, according to [[Donald Keyhoe]], later director of the [[National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena]] (NICAP), the real reason for the sudden search was because two near-Earth orbiting objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in the summer of 1953, according to his [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] source.\n\nBy May 1954, Keyhoe was making public statements that his sources told him the search had indeed been successful, and either one or two objects had been found.<ref>{{Cite news|title=1 or 2 Artificial Satellites Circling Earth, Says Expert|newspaper=San Francisco Examiner|pages=14|date=1954-05-14|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_Keyhoe_May1954.html}}</ref> However, the story did not break until August 23, 1954, when ''[[Aviation Week]]'' magazine stated that two satellites had been found only 400 and 600 miles out. They were termed \"natural satellites\" and implied that they had been recently captured, despite this being a virtual impossibility. The next day, the story was in many major newspapers. Dr. LaPaz was implicated in the discovery in addition to Tombaugh. LaPaz had earlier conducted secret investigations on behalf of the Air Force on the [[green fireballs]] and other unidentified aerial phenomena over New Mexico. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on August 29 that \"a source close to the O. O. R. unit here described as 'quite accurate' the report in the magazine Aviation Week that two previously unobserved satellites had been spotted and identified by Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico as natural and not artificial objects. This source also said there was absolutely no connection between the reported satellites and [[flying saucer]] reports.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Earth 'Satellites' Spur Army Study|newspaper=New York Times|pages=35|date=August 29, 1954|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_NYTIMES_1954.html}}</ref> However, in the October 10th issue, LaPaz said the magazine article was \"false in every particular, in so far as reference to me is concerned.\"<ref>{{Cite news|title=Scientist denies space base find|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 10, 1954|url=http://www.roswellproof.com/Satellites_NYTIMES_1954.html}}</ref>\n\nBoth LaPaz and Tombaugh were to issue public denials that anything had been found. The October 1955 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' magazine reported: \"Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won't say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered.  He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct.

He was a younger son of [[Stephen VIII B\u00e1thory|Stephen B\u00e1thory of Somly\u00f3]]. Christopher's career began during the reign of Queen [[Isabella Jagiellon]], who administered the [[Eastern Hungarian Kingdom|eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary]] on behalf of her son, [[John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya]], from 1556 to 1559. He was one of the commanders of John Sigismund's army in the early 1560s.\n\nChristopher's brother, [[Stephen B\u00e1thory]], who succeeded John Sigismund in 1571, made Christopher captain of V\u00e1rad (now [[Oradea]] in Romania). After being elected [[King of Poland]], Stephen B\u00e1thory adopted the title of [[Prince of Transylvania]] and made Christopher voivode in 1576.

Telegdi]].{{sfn|Horn|2002|p=245}}{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=101}} His father was a supporter of [[John Z\u00e1polya]], [[King of Hungary]], who made him voivode of Transylvania in February 1530.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=101}} Christopher was born in [[\u0218imleu Silvaniei Fort|B\u00e1thorys' castle]] at Szil\u00e1gysomly\u00f3 (now [[\u0218imleu Silvaniei]] in Romania) in the same year.{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}} His father died in 1534.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=282}}\n\nHis brother, Andrew, and their kinsman, [[Tam\u00e1s N\u00e1dasdy]], took charge of Christopher's education.{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}} Christopher visited England, France, Italy, Spain, and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in his youth.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}} He also served as a page in [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]'s court.{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}}\n\n== Career ==\nChristopher entered the service of John Z\u00e1polya's widow, Isabella Jagiellon, in the late 1550s.{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}} At the time, Isabella administered the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary on behalf of her son, John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya.{{sfn|Barta|1994|pp=258\u2013259}} She wanted to persuade [[Henry II of France]] to withdraw his troops from three fortresses that the Ottomans had captured in [[Banat]], so she sent Christopher to France to start negotiations in 1557.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}}\n\nJohn Sigismund took charge of the administration of his realm after his mother died on

the rebellion of [[Melchior Balassa]],{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=259}} Christopher persuaded John Sigismund to fight for his realm instead of fleeing to Poland in 1562.{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}} Christopher was one of the commanders of John Sigismund's troops during the ensuing war against the Habsburg rulers of the western territories of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]] and [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian]], who tried to reunite the kingdom under their rule.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=101}}{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=259}} Christopher defeated Maximilian's commander, [[Lazarus von Schwendi]], forcing him to lift the siege of Huszt (now [[Khust]] in Ukraine) in 1565.{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=101}}\n\nAfter the death of John Sigismund, the [[Diet of Transylvania]] elected Christopher's younger brother, Stephen B\u00e1thory, voivode (or ruler) on 25 May 1571.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}} Stephen made Christopher captain of V\u00e1rad (now Oradea in Romania).{{sfn|Mark\u00f3|2006|p=101}} The following year, the [[Ottoman Sultan]], [[Selim II]] (who was the overlord of Transylvania), acknowledged the hereditary right of the

closely.{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}}\n\n[[Nontrinitarianism|Anti-Trinitarian]] preachers began to condemn the worshiping of Jesus in [[Partium]] and [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]] in 1576, although the Diet had already forbade all doctrinal innovations.{{sfn|Keul|2009|pp=119, 121}} Ferenc D\u00e1vid, the most influential leader of the Unitarian Church of Transylvania, openly joined the dissenters in the autumn of 1578.{{sfn|Keul|2009|p=121}} Christopher invited [[Fausto Sozzini]], a leading Anti-Trinitarian theologian, to Transylvania to convince D\u00e1vid that the new teaching was erroneous.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}} Since D\u00e1vid refused to obey, Christopher held a Diet and the \"[[Unio Trium Nationum|Three Nations]]\" (including the Unitarian delegates) ordered D\u00e1vid's imprisonment.{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}}{{sfn|Szegedi|2009|pp=106\u2013107}} Christopher also supported his brother's attempts to strengthen the position of the Roman Catholic Church in Transylvania.{{sfn|Szab\u00f3|2012|p=182}}{{sfn|Barta|1994|p=260}} He granted estates to the Jesuits to promote the establishment of a college in Kolozsv\u00e1r (now [[Cluj-Napoca]] in Romania) on 5

Perl calls these ''modules''.  [[Perl module]]s are typically installed in one of several [[directory (computing)|directories]] whose [[path (computing)|paths]] are placed in the Perl [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] when it is first [[compiler|compiled]]; on [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, common paths include ''/usr/lib/perl5'', ''/usr/local/lib/perl5'', and several of their subdirectories.\n\nPerl comes with a small set of ''core modules''.  Some of these perform bootstrapping tasks, such as <code>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</code>, which is used for building and installing other extension modules; others, like [[CGI.pm]], are merely commonly used.\n\n==Role==\n\nThe CPAN's main purpose is to help programmers locate modules and programs not included in the Perl standard distribution.  Its structure is decentralized. Authors maintain and improve their own modules. Forking, and creating competing modules for the same task or purpose, is common. There is no formal bug tracking system, but there is a third-party bug tracking system that CPAN designated as the suggested official method of reporting issues with modules. Continuous development on modules is rare; many are abandoned by their authors, or go years between new versions being released. Sometimes a maintainer will be appointed to an abandoned module. They can release new versions of the module, and accept patches from the community to the module as their time permits. CPAN has no [[revision control system]], although the source for the modules is often stored on [[GitHub]]. Also, the complete history of the CPAN and all its modules is available as the GitPAN project,<ref name=\"gitpan-readme\">{{cite web|url=https://github.com/evalEmpire/gitpan/blob/master/README.md|date=2 December 2015|access-date=16 November 2016|title=What is Gitpan?}}</ref> allowing to easily see the complete history for all the modules and for easy maintenance of forks. CPAN is also used to distribute new versions of Perl, as well as related projects, such as [[Parrot virtual machine|Parrot]] and [[Perl 6]].\n\n==Structure==\nFiles on the CPAN are referred to as ''distributions''. A distribution may consist of one or more modules, documentation files, or programs packaged in a common archiving format, such as a [[gzip]]ped [[tar file format|tar]] archive or a [[ZIP file format|ZIP]] file. Distributions will often contain installation scripts (usually called ''Makefile.PL'' or ''Build.PL'') and test scripts which can be run to verify the contents of the distribution are functioning properly. New distributions are uploaded to the Perl Authors Upload Server, or PAUSE (see the section [[#Uploading distributions with PAUSE|Uploading distributions with PAUSE]]).\n\nIn 2003, distributions started to include metadata files, called ''META.[[YAML|yml]]'', indicating the distribution's name, version, dependencies, and other useful information; however, not all distributions contain metadata. When metadata is not present in a distribution, the PAUSE's software will usually try to analyze the code in the distribution to look for the same information; this is not necessarily very reliable.\n\nWith thousands of distributions, CPAN needs to be structured to be useful. Distributions on the CPAN are divided into 24 broad ''chapters'' based on their purpose, such as ''[[Internationalization]] and [[Locale (computer software)|Locale]]''; ''[[Archiving]], [[data compression|Compression]], And [[data conversion|Conversion]]''; and ''[[Mail]] and [[Usenet]] News''. Distributions can also be browsed by author. Finally, the natural hierarchy of Perl module names (such as <code>Apache::DBI</code> or <code>Lingua::EN::Inflect</code>) can sometimes be used to browse modules in the CPAN.\n\nCPAN module distributions usually have names in the form of ''CGI-Application-3.1'' (where the '''::''' used in the module's name has been replaced with a dash, and the version number has been appended to the name), but this is only a convention; many prominent distributions break the convention, especially those that contain multiple modules. Security restrictions prevent a distribution from ever being replaced, so virtually all distribution names do include a [[version number]].\n\n==Components==\n===Mirrors===\n\nThe distribution infrastructure of CPAN consists of its worldwide network of more than 250 mirrors in more than 60 countries.<ref name=\"cpan-SITES\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html|title=CPAN Mirror Network|access-date=16 November 2016}}</ref> Each full mirror hosts around 20 [[gigabyte]]s of data.<ref name=\"mirror-howto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpan.org/misc/how-to-mirror.html|access-date=15 November 2016|title=How to mirror CPAN|publisher=CPAN.org}}</ref>\n\nMost mirrors update themselves hourly, daily or bidaily from the CPAN master site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/stats/mirmon/cpan.html|title=CPAN Status and Statistics|accessdate=2010-05-09}}</ref>  Some sites are major FTP servers which mirror lots of other software, but others are simply servers owned by companies that use Perl heavily. There are at least two mirrors on every continent except Antarctica.\n\n===Search engines===\n\nSeveral search engines have been written to help Perl programmers sort through the CPAN. The official {{url|search.cpan.org}} includes textual search, a browsable index of modules, and extracted copies of all distributions currently on the CPAN. On May 16, 2018, the Perl Foundation announced that search.cpan.org would be shut down on June 29, 2018 (after 19 years of operation), due to its aging codebase and maintenance burden. Users will be transitioned and redirected to the third-party alternative MetaCPAN.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://log.perl.org/2018/05/goodbye-search-dot-cpan-dot-org.html|title=The end of an era: Saying goodbye to search.cpan.org|website=log.perl.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perl.com/article/saying-goodbye-to-search-cpan-org/|title=Saying goodbye to search.cpan.org|website=perl.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref>\n\n===Testers===\n\nCPAN Testers are a group of volunteers, who will download and test distributions as they are uploaded to CPAN. This enables the authors to have their modules tested on many platforms and environments that they would otherwise not have access to, thus helping to promote portability, as well as a degree of quality. Smoke testers send reports, which are then collated and used for a variety of presentation websites, including the main reports site, statistics and dependencies.\n\n===CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS===\n\nThere is also a Perl core module named CPAN; it is usually differentiated from the repository itself by using the name CPAN.pm.  CPAN.pm is mainly an interactive shell which can be used to search for, download, and install distributions.  An interactive shell called <tt>cpan</tt> is also provided in the Perl core, and is the usual way of running CPAN.pm. After a short configuration process and mirror selection, it uses tools available on the user's computer to automatically download, unpack, compile, test, and install modules.  It is also capable of updating itself.\n\nMore recently, an effort to replace CPAN.pm with something cleaner and more modern has resulted in the CPANPLUS (or CPAN++) set of modules.  CPANPLUS separates the back-end work of downloading, compiling, and installing modules from the interactive shell used to issue commands.  It also supports several advanced features, such as cryptographic signature checking and test result reporting.  Finally, CPANPLUS can uninstall a distribution.  CPANPLUS was added to the Perl core in version 5.10.0.\n\nBoth modules can check a distribution's [[coupling (computer science)|dependencies]] and can be set to recursively install any prerequisites, either automatically or with individual user approval.  Both support FTP and HTTP and can work through firewalls and proxies.\n\n===Uploading distributions with PAUSE===\n\nAuthors can upload new distributions to the CPAN through the ''Perl Authors Upload Server'' (PAUSE).  To do so, they must request a PAUSE account.\n\nOnce registered, they may use a web interface at [https://pause.perl.org pause.perl.org], or an [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] interface to upload files to their directory and delete them.  PAUSE will warn an administrator if a user uploads a module that already exists, unless they are listed as a ''co-maintainer''.  This can be specified through PAUSE's web interface.\n\n==Influence==\n\nExperienced Perl programmers often comment that half of Perl's power is in the CPAN. It has been called Perl's [[killer app]].<ref name=\"PERLmonks\">{{cite web |title=Re: Killer Apps in PERL|url=http://www.perlmonks.org/bare/?node_id=187498|accessdate=2013-02-24}}</ref> It is roughly equivalent to the [[PHP Extension Community Library|PECL]] and [[PHP Extension and Application Repository|PEAR]] for [[PHP]]; the [[PyPI]] (Python Package Index) repository for [[Python (programming language)|Python]]; [[RubyGems]] for [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]]; [[CRAN (R programming language)|CRAN]] for [[R (programming language)|R]]; [[npm (software)|npm]] for [[Node.js]]; [[LuaRocks]] for [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]; and [[Hackage]] for [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].  Other major languages, such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C++]], have nothing similar to the CPAN (though for Java there is central [[Apache Maven|Maven]]).\n\nGiven its importance to the Perl developer community, the CPAN both shapes and is shaped by [[Perl#Perl_community|Perl's culture]]. Its \"self-appointed master librarian\", [[Jarkko Hietaniemi]], often takes part in the [[April Fools' Day]] jokes; on 1 April 2002 the site was temporarily named to ''CJAN'', where the \"J\" stood for \"Java\". In 2003, the <code>www.cpan.org</code> domain name was redirected to [[Matt's Script Archive]], a site infamous in the Perl community for having badly written code.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Elements of Programming with Perl\n|url=http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=36308\n|date=2000-10-12\n|accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Exploit this formmail.pl for fun and, well, fun\n|url=http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=102758\n|date=2001-08-07\n|accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|title=Matt's Script Archive Strikes Again!\n|url=http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=93731\n|date=2001-07-04\n|accessdate=2013-04-25}}</ref>\n\nSome of the distributions on the CPAN are distributed as jokes.  The <code>[[Acme Corporation|Acme]]::</code> hierarchy is reserved for joke modules; for instance, <code>Acme::Don't</code> adds a <code>don't</code> function that doesn't run the code given to it (to complement the <code>do</code> built-in, which does).  Even outside the <code>Acme::</code> hierarchy, some modules are still written largely for amusement; one example is <code>Lingua::Romana::Perligata</code>, which can be used to write Perl programs in a subset of Latin.\n\n===Derivative works===\n\nIn 2005, a group of Perl developers who also had an interest in JavaScript got together to create [[JSAN]], the JavaScript Archive Network. The JSAN is a near-direct port of the CPAN infrastructure for use with the JavaScript language, which for most of its lifespan did not have a cohesive \"community\".\n\nIn 2008, after a chance meeting with CPAN admin [[Adam Kennedy (programmer)|Adam Kennedy]] at the Open Source Developers Conference, Linux kernel developer [[Rusty Russell]] created the CCAN, the Comprehensive C Archive Network. The CCAN is a direct port of the CPAN architecture for use with the C language.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n* {{official website|http://www.cpan.org}}\n* [https://metacpan.org MetaCPAN]\n* [http://www.cpan.org/SITES.html List of official CPAN mirrors]\n* [http://www.cpan.org/misc/ZCAN.html ZCAN - \"The Zen of Comprehensive Archive Networks\"] - a document that aims to explain how and why CPAN succeeded and how to duplicate it in similar efforts.

The Rockies compete in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) as a member club of the [[National League]] (NL) [[National League West|West]] division. The team's home venue is [[Coors Field]], located in the [[LoDo, Denver|Lower Downtown]] area of Denver. The Rockies won their first [[List of National League pennant winners|National League championship]] in [[2007 National League Championship Series|2007]], after having won 14 of their final 15 games in order to secure a Wild Card position. In the World Series they were swept by the [[American League]] (AL) champion [[Boston Red Sox]] in four games.\n\n==History==\n{{unsourced section|date=June 2017}}\n{{main article|History of the Colorado Rockies}}\n{{see also|1993 Major League Baseball expansion}}\n\nDenver had long been a hotbed of [[Denver Zephyrs|Denver Bears/Zephyrs]] [[Minor League Baseball|minor league baseball]] and many{{who|date=June 2017}} in the area desired a Major League team.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]], an unsuccessful attempt was made to purchase the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and relocate them. However, in 1991, as part of Major League Baseball's two-team expansion (along with the [[Miami Marlins|Florida (now Miami) Marlins]]), an ownership group representing Denver led by John Antonucci and [[Michael I. Monus]] was granted a franchise; they took the name \"Rockies\" due to Denver's proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]], which is reflected in their logo. Monus and Antonucci were forced to drop out in 1992 after Monus' reputation was ruined by an accounting scandal.{{cn|date=June 2017}} Trucking magnate [[Jerry McMorris]] stepped in at the 11th hour to save the franchise, allowing the team to begin play in 1993. The Rockies shared [[Mile High Stadium]] (which had originally been built for the Bears) with the [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[Denver Broncos]] for their first two seasons while [[Coors Field]] was constructed. It was completed for the [[1995 Major League Baseball season]].\n\nIn [[1993 Major League Baseball season|1993]], they started play in the [[National League West|West division]] of the [[National League]]. The Rockies were MLB's first team based in the Mountain Time Zone. have reached the [[Major League Baseball postseason]] five times, each time as the National League [[wild card (sports)|wild card]] team. Twice ([[1995 Major League Baseball season|1995]] and [[2009 Major League Baseball season|2009]]) they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. In 2007, the Rockies advanced to the [[World Series]], only to be swept by the [[2007 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]].\n\nThe Rockies have played their home games at [[Coors Field]] since 1995. Their newest [[spring training]] home, [[Salt River Fields at Talking Stick]] in Scottsdale, Arizona, opened in March 2011 and is shared with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]].\n\n==Season record==\n{{Main article|List of Colorado Rockies seasons}}\n\n==Uniform==\n{{Further information|Major League Baseball uniforms}}\nAt the start of the 2012 season, the Rockies introduced \"Purple Mondays\" in which the team wears its purple uniform every Monday game day.<ref>{{cite press release|title=Rockies Introduce Purple Mondays Campaign During \u2018Year of the Fan\u2019|url=http://m.rockies.mlb.com/news/article/28024750/rockies-introduce-purple-mondays-campaign-during-8216year-of-the-fan8217/|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|website=Rockies.com|date=April 6, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rockies introduce 'Purple Monday' campaign|url=http://www.kktv.com/sports/headlines/Rockies_introduce_Purple_Monday_campaign_146502835.html|publisher=[[KKTV]]|date=April 6, 2012|accessdate=August 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Baseball Hall of Famers==\nNo inducted members of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] have played for or managed the Rockies.\n\n===Colorado Sports Hall of Fame===\n{{main article|Colorado Sports Hall of Fame}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"{{Baseball primary style|Colorado Rockies}};\"|'''Colorado Rockies in the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame'''\n|-\n! style=\"width:40px;

Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel ([[construction aggregate|aggregate]]) together. Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] for masonry, or with [[sand]] and [[gravel]], produces [[concrete]].\n\nCements used in construction are usually [[inorganic]], often [[lime (material)|lime]] or [[calcium silicate]] based, and can be characterized as either '''hydraulic''' or '''non-hydraulic''', depending on the ability of the cement to set in the presence of water (see [[Lime mortar#Hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime|hydraulic and non-hydraulic lime plaster]]).\n\n'''Non-hydraulic cement''' does not set in wet conditions or under water. Rather, it sets as it dries and reacts with [[carbon dioxide]] in the air. It is resistant to attack by chemicals after setting.\n\n'''Hydraulic cements''' (e.g., [[Portland cement]]) set and become [[adhesive]] due to a [[chemical reaction]] between the dry ingredients and water. The chemical reaction results in mineral [[hydrate]]s that are not very water-soluble and so are quite durable in water and safe from chemical attack. This allows setting in wet conditions or under water and further protects the hardened material from chemical attack. The chemical process for hydraulic cement found by ancient Romans used [[volcanic ash]] ([[pozzolana]]) with added lime (calcium oxide).\n\nThe word \"cement\" can be traced back to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] term ''[[opus caementicium]]'', used to describe [[masonry]] resembling modern [[concrete]] that was made from crushed rock with [[Calcium oxide|burnt lime]] as binder. The volcanic ash and pulverized [[brick]] supplements that were added to the burnt lime, to obtain a [[hydraulic binder]], were later referred to as ''cementum'', ''cimentum'', ''c\u00e4ment'', and ''cement''. In modern times, organic polymers are sometimes used as cements in concrete.\n\n==Chemistry==\n'''Non-hydraulic cement''', such as [[slaked lime]] ([[calcium oxide]] mixed with water), hardens by [[carbonation]] in the presence of [[carbon dioxide]], which is naturally present in the air. First [[calcium oxide]] (lime) is produced from [[calcium carbonate]] (limestone or chalk) by [[calcination]] at temperatures above 825&nbsp;\u00b0C (1,517&nbsp;\u00b0F) for about 10 hours at [[atmospheric pressure]]:\n:CaCO<sub>3</sub> \u2192 CaO + CO<sub>2</sub>\nThe calcium oxide is then ''spent'' (slaked) mixing it with water to make slaked lime (calcium hydroxide):\n:CaO + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>\nOnce the excess water is completely evaporated (this process is technically called ''setting''), the carbonation starts:\n:Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CaCO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThis reaction takes time, because the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the air is low. The carbonation reaction requires that the dry cement be exposed to air, so the slaked lime is a non-hydraulic cement and cannot be used under water. This process is called the ''lime cycle''.\n\nConversely, '''hydraulic cement''' hardens by hydration when water is added. Hydraulic cements (such as [[Portland cement]]) are made of a mixture of silicates and oxides, the four main components being:\n:[[Belite]] (2CaO\u00b7SiO<sub>2</sub>);\n:[[Alite]] (3CaO\u00b7SiO<sub>2</sub>);\n:[[Tricalcium aluminate]] (3CaO\u00b7Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) (historically, and still occasionally, called 'celite');\n:[[Brownmillerite]] (4CaO\u00b7Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>\u00b7Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).\n\nThe silicates are responsible for the cement's mechanical properties\u2014the tricalcium aluminate and brownmillerite are essential for formation of the liquid phase during the kiln sintering (firing). The chemistry of these reactions is not completely clear and is still the object of research.<ref>[http://cee.mit.edu/cee-in-focus/2011/spring/cement-structure Cement's basic molecular structure finally decoded (MIT, 2009)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221105202/http://cee.mit.edu/cee-in-focus/2011/spring/cement-structure |date=21 February 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nPerhaps the earliest known occurrence of cement is from twelve million years ago.

However, Aspdins' cement was nothing like modern Portland cement but was a first step in its development, called a ''proto-Portland cement''.<ref name=\"Blezard\"/> Joseph Aspdins' son [[William Aspdin]] had left his father's company and in his cement manufacturing apparently accidentally produced [[calcium silicate]]s in the 1840s, a middle step in the development of Portland cement. William Aspdin's innovation was counterintuitive for manufacturers of \"artificial cements\", because they required more lime in the mix (a problem for his father), a much higher kiln temperature (and therefore more fuel), and the resulting [[clinker (cement)|clinker]] was very hard and rapidly wore down the [[millstone]]s, which were the only available grinding technology of the time. Manufacturing costs were therefore considerably higher, but the product set reasonably slowly and developed strength quickly, thus opening up a market for use in concrete. The use of concrete in construction grew rapidly from 1850 onward, and was soon the dominant use for cements. Thus Portland cement began its predominant role. [[Isaac Charles Johnson]] further refined the production of ''meso-Portland cement'' (middle stage of development) and claimed he was the real father of Portland cement.<ref>Hahn, Thomas F., and Emory Leland Kemp. ''Cement mills along the Potomac River''. Morgantown, WV: West Virginia University Press, 1994. 16. Print.</ref>\n\nSetting time and \"early strength\" are important characteristics of cements. Hydraulic limes, \"natural\" cements, and \"artificial\" cements all rely on their [[belite]] content for [[Physical strength|strength]] development. Belite develops strength slowly. Because they were burned at temperatures below {{convert|1250|C|F}}, they contained no [[alite]], which is responsible for early strength in modern cements. The first cement to consistently contain alite was made by William Aspdin in the early 1840s: This was what we call today \"modern\" Portland cement. Because of the air of mystery with which William Aspdin surrounded his product, others (''e.g.,'' Vicat and Johnson) have claimed precedence in this invention, but recent analysis<ref>{{cite book|author=Hewlett, Peter|title=Lea's Chemistry of Cement and Concrete|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1JVu4iifnMC|year=2003|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-053541-8|page=Ch. 1|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101041700/https://books.google.com/books?id=v1JVu4iifnMC|archivedate=1 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> of both his concrete and raw cement have shown that William Aspdin's product made at [[Northfleet]], [[Kent]] was a true alite-based cement. However, Aspdin's methods were \"rule-of-thumb\": Vicat is responsible for establishing the chemical basis of these cements, and Johnson established the importance of [[sintering]] the mix in the kiln.\n\nIn the US the first large-scale use of cement was [[Rosendale cement]], a natural cement mined from a massive deposit of a large [[Dolostone|dolostone rock]] deposit discovered in the early 19th century near [[Rosendale, New York]]. Rosendale cement was extremely popular for the foundation of buildings (''e.g.'', [[Statue of Liberty]], [[United States Capitol|Capitol Building]], [[Brooklyn Bridge]]) and lining water pipes.<ref name=\"Natural Cement Comes Back\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=VCcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118 \"Natural Cement Comes Back\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425093525/https://books.google.com/books?id=VCcDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA118 |date=25 April 2016 }}, October 1941, ''Popular Science''</ref>\n\n[[Sorel cement]] was patented in 1867 by Frenchman [[Stanislas Sorel]].

Because of the switch to Portland cement, by the end of the 1920s only one of the 15 Rosendale cement companies had survived. But in the early 1930s, builders discovered that, while Portland cement set faster, it was not as durable, especially for highways\u2014to the point that some states stopped building highways and roads with cement. Bertrain H. Wait, an engineer whose company had helped construct the New York City's [[Catskill Aqueduct]], was impressed with the durability of Rosendale cement, and came up with a blend of both Rosendale and synthetic cements that had the good attributes of both. It was highly durable and had a much faster setting time. Wait convinced the New York Commissioner of Highways to construct an experimental section of highway near [[New Paltz, New York]], using one sack of Rosendale to six sacks of synthetic cement. It was a success, and for decades the Rosendale-synthetic cement blend was used in highway and bridge construction.<ref name=\"Natural Cement Comes Back\"/>\n\n==Modern cements==\nModern hydraulic development began with the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]] (around 1800), driven by three main needs:\n* Hydraulic [[cement render]] ([[stucco]]) for finishing brick buildings in wet climates\n* Hydraulic mortars for masonry construction of harbor works, etc., in contact with sea water\n* Development of strong concretes\n\nModern cements are often [[Portland cement]] or Portland cement blends, but industry also uses other cements.\n{{Components_of_Cement,_Comparison_of_Chemical_and_Physical_Characteristics}}\n<!--[[File:Comparison of Chemical and Physical Characteristics Portland Cement - Fly Ash, Slag Cement, and Silica Fume.jpg|thumb|Comparison of chemical and physical characteristics of Portland, fly ash, slag, and silica fume cements]]-->\n\n=== Portland cement ===\n{{Main|Portland cement}}\nPortland cement is by far the most common type of cement in general use around the world. This cement is made by heating [[limestone]] (calcium carbonate) with other materials (such as [[clay]]) to 1450&nbsp;\u00b0C in a [[kiln]], in a process known as [[calcination]] that liberates a molecule of [[carbon dioxide]] from the calcium carbonate to form [[calcium oxide]], or quicklime\u2014which then chemically combines with the other materials in the mix to form calcium silicates and other cementitious compounds. The resulting hard substance, called 'clinker', is then ground with a small amount of [[gypsum]] into a powder to make ''ordinary Portland cement'', the most commonly used type of cement (often referred to as OPC).\nPortland cement is a basic ingredient of [[concrete]], [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]], and most non-specialty [[grout]]. The most common use for Portland cement is to make concrete. Concrete is a composite material made of [[Construction aggregate|aggregate]] ([[gravel]] and [[sand]]), cement, and [[water]]. As a construction material, concrete can be cast in almost any shape, and once it hardens, can be a structural (load bearing) element. Portland cement may be grey or white.\n\n===Portland cement blends===\n<!--Clinker (cement) links here--->\nPortland cement blends are often available as inter-ground mixtures from cement producers, but similar formulations are often also mixed from the ground components at the concrete mixing plant.<ref>{{cite book | author = Kosmatka, S.H. |author2=Panarese, W.C. | title = Design and Control of Concrete Mixtures | publisher = [[Portland Cement Association]] | year = 1988 | location = Skokie, IL, USA | pages = 17, 42, 70, 184 | isbn = 0-89312-087-1 }}</ref>\n\n'''Portland blast-furnace slag cement, or Blast furnace cement''' (ASTM C595 and EN 197-1 nomenclature respectively), contains up to 95% [[ground granulated blast furnace slag]], with the rest Portland clinker and a little gypsum.

In countries where [[volcanic ash]]es are available (e.g., [[Italy]], [[Chile]], [[Mexico]], the [[Philippines]]), these cements are often the most common form in use. The maximum replacement ratios are generally defined as for Portland-fly ash cement.\n\n'''Portland silica fume cement'''. Addition of [[silica fume]] can yield exceptionally high strengths, and cements containing 5\u201320% silica fume are occasionally produced, with 10% being the maximum allowed addition under EN 197-1. However, silica fume is more usually added to Portland cement at the concrete mixer.<ref>{{cite web | author = U.S. Federal Highway Administration | authorlink = Federal Highway Administration | title = Silica Fume | url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | accessdate = 24 January 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070122022403/http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/silica.htm | archivedate = 22 January 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n'''Masonry cements''' are used for preparing bricklaying [[mortar (masonry)|mortars]] and [[stuccos]], and must not be used in concrete. They are usually complex proprietary formulations containing Portland clinker and a number of other ingredients that may include limestone, hydrated lime, air entrainers, retarders, waterproofers and coloring agents. They are formulated to yield workable mortars that allow rapid and consistent masonry work. Subtle variations of Masonry cement in the US are Plastic Cements and Stucco Cements. These are designed to produce a controlled bond with masonry blocks.\n\n'''Expansive cements''' contain, in addition to Portland clinker, expansive clinkers (usually sulfoaluminate clinkers), and are designed to offset the effects of drying shrinkage normally encountered in hydraulic cements. This cement can make concrete for floor slabs (up to 60&nbsp;m square) without contraction joints.\n\n'''White blended cements''' may be made using white clinker (containing little or no iron) and white supplementary materials such as high-purity [[metakaolin]]. '''Colored cements''' serve decorative purposes. Some standards allow the addition of pigments to produce ''colored Portland cement''. Other standards (e.g., ASTM) don't allow pigments in Portland cement, and colored cements are sold as ''blended hydraulic cements''.\n\n'''Very finely ground cements''' are cement mixed with sand or with slag or other pozzolan type minerals that are extremely finely ground together. Such cements can have the same physical characteristics as normal cement but with 50% less cement, particularly due to their increased surface area for the chemical reaction. Even with intensive grinding they can use up to 50% less energy (and thus less carbon emissions) to fabricate than ordinary Portland cements.<ref name=Justnes>{{cite journal | title = Mechanism for performance of energetically modified cement versus corresponding blended cement | url = http://www.emccement.com/Articles/EMC%20mechanism%20paper.pdf| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110710185446/http://www.emccement.com/Articles/EMC%20mechanism%20paper.pdf| archivedate = 2011-07-10|journal=Cement and Concrete Research |volume=35 |year=2005|pages= 315\u2013323|doi=10.1016/j.cemconres.2004.05.022 | last1 = Justnes | first1 = Harald | last2 = Elfgren | first2 = Lennart | last3 = Ronin | first3 = Vladimir | issue = 2}}</ref>\n\n===Other cements===\n\n''Pozzolan-lime cements'' are mixtures of ground [[pozzolanic ash|pozzolan]] and [[Agricultural lime|lime]]. These are the cements the Romans used, and are present in surviving Roman structures like the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome. They develop strength slowly, but their ultimate strength can be very high. The hydration products that produce strength are essentially the same as those in Portland cement.\n\n''Slag-lime cements''\u2014[[ground granulated blast-furnace slag]] is not hydraulic on its own, but is \"activated\" by addition of alkalis, most economically using lime. They are similar to pozzolan lime cements in their properties. Only granulated slag (i.e., water-quenched, glassy slag) is effective as a cement component.\n\n''Supersulfated cements'' contain about 80% ground granulated blast furnace slag, 15% [[gypsum]] or [[anhydrite]] and a little Portland clinker or lime as an activator. They produce strength by formation of [[ettringite]], with strength growth similar to a slow Portland cement. They exhibit good resistance to aggressive agents, including sulfate.\n[[Calcium aluminate cements]] are hydraulic cements made primarily from [[limestone]] and [[bauxite]]. The active ingredients are monocalcium aluminate CaAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (CaO \u00b7 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> or CA in [[Cement chemist notation]], CCN) and [[mayenite]] Ca<sub>12</sub>Al<sub>14</sub>O<sub>33</sub> (12 CaO \u00b7 7 Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, or C<sub>12</sub>A<sub>7</sub> in CCN). Strength forms by hydration to calcium aluminate hydrates. They are well-adapted for use in refractory (high-temperature resistant) concretes, e.g., for furnace linings.\n\n''Calcium sulfoaluminate cements'' are made from clinkers that include [[ye'elimite]] (Ca<sub>4</sub>(AlO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or C<sub>4</sub>A<sub>3</sub>{{overline|S}} in [[Cement chemist notation|Cement chemist's notation]]) as a primary phase. They are used in expansive cements, in ultra-high early strength cements, and in \"low-energy\" cements. Hydration produces ettringite, and specialized physical properties (such as expansion or rapid reaction) are obtained by adjustment of the availability of calcium and sulfate ions. Their use as a low-energy alternative to Portland cement has been pioneered in China, where several million tonnes per year are produced.<ref>Bye G.C.

In addition, the lower limestone content and lower fuel consumption leads to a CO<sub>2</sub> emission around half that associated with Portland clinker. However, SO<sub>2</sub> emissions are usually significantly higher.\n\n''\"Natural\" cements'' corresponding to certain cements of the pre-Portland era, are produced by burning [[argillaceous minerals|argillaceous limestones]] at moderate temperatures. The level of clay components in the limestone (around 30\u201335%) is such that large amounts of [[belite]] (the low-early strength, high-late strength mineral in Portland cement) are formed without the formation of excessive amounts of free lime. As with any natural material, such cements have highly variable properties.\n\n''[[Geopolymer]] cements'' are made from mixtures of water-soluble alkali metal silicates, and aluminosilicate mineral powders such as [[fly ash]] and [[metakaolin]].\n\n'''Polymer cements''' are made from organic chemicals that polymerise. Producers often use [[thermoset]] materials. While they are often significantly more expensive, they can give a water proof material that has useful tensile strength.\n\n==Setting and curing==\nCement starts to set when mixed with water, which causes a series of hydration chemical reactions. The constituents slowly hydrate and the mineral hydrates solidify. The interlocking of the hydrates gives cement its strength. Contrary to a common belief, hydraulic cement does not set by drying out\u2014proper curing requires maintaining the appropriate moisture content during the curing process. If hydraulic cements dry out during curing, the resulting product can be significantly weakened. Nonetheless, a minimum temperature of 5&nbsp;\u00b0C is recommended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sovchem.co.uk/profile/news/read/id/206/|title=Using cement based products during winter months|last=|first=|date=2018-05-29|website=sovchem.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Safety issues==\nBags of cement routinely have health and safety warnings printed on them because not only is cement highly [[alkali]]ne, but the setting process is [[exothermic]].

The high pH prevailing in the cement porewater (12.5 < pH < 13.5) limits the mobility of many heavy metals by decreasing their solubility and increasing their sorption onto the cement mineral phases. [[Nickel]], [[zinc]] and [[lead]] are commonly found in cement in non-negligible concentrations. [[Chromium]] may also directly arise as natural impurity from the raw materials or as secondary contamination from the abrasion of hard chromium steel alloys used in the ball mills when the clinker is ground. As [[chromate]] (CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>) is toxic and may cause severe skin allergies at trace concentration, it is sometimes reduced into trivalent Cr(III) by addition of [[ferrous sulfate]] (FeSO<sub>4</sub>).\n\n===Use of alternative fuels and by-products materials===\nA cement plant consumes 3 to 6 [[Gigajoule|GJ]] of fuel per tonne of clinker produced, depending on the raw materials and the process used. Most cement kilns today use coal and petroleum coke as primary fuels, and to a lesser extent natural gas and fuel oil. Selected waste and by-products with recoverable calorific value can be used as fuels in a cement kiln (referred to as [[co-processing]]), replacing a portion of conventional fossil fuels, like coal, if they meet strict specifications. Selected waste and by-products containing useful minerals such as calcium, silica, alumina, and iron can be used as raw materials in the kiln, replacing raw materials such as clay, [[shale]], and limestone. Because some materials have both useful mineral content and recoverable calorific value, the distinction between alternative fuels and raw materials is not always clear. For example, sewage sludge has a low but significant calorific value, and burns to give ash containing minerals useful in the clinker matrix.<ref>[http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/Vjft3qGjo1v6HREH7jM6/tf2-guidelines.pdf Guidelines for the Selection and Use of Fuels and Raw Materials in the Cement Manufacturing Process] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910015447/http://www.wbcsd.org/DocRoot/Vjft3qGjo1v6HREH7jM6/tf2-guidelines.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}, ''[[World Business Council for Sustainable Development]]'' (1 June 2005).</ref>\n\nNormal cement kiln operation provides combustion conditions that are more than adequate for the destruction of even the most difficult to destroy organic substances.

The team plays its home games at [[Great American Ball Park]], which opened in 2003 replacing [[Riverfront Stadium]]. [[Bob Castellini]] has been chief executive officer since 2006.\n\n==Franchise history==<!-- This section is linked from [[National League]] -->\n{{Main article|History of the Cincinnati Reds}}\n{{see also|List of Cincinnati Reds seasons}}\n\n===The birth of the Reds and the American Association (1881\u20131889)===\nThe origins of the modern Cincinnati Reds can be traced to the expulsion of an earlier team bearing that name. In 1876, Cincinnati became one of the charter members of the new [[National League]], but the club ran afoul of league organizer and long-time president [[William Hulbert]] for selling beer during games and renting out their ballpark on Sundays. Both were important activities to entice the city's large [[Germans|German]] population. While Hulbert made clear his distaste for both beer and Sunday baseball at the founding of the league, neither practice was actually against league rules in those early years. On October 6, 1880, however, seven of the eight team owners pledged at a special league meeting to formally ban both beer and Sunday baseball at the regular league meeting that December. Only Cincinnati president W. H. Kennett refused to sign the pledge, so the other owners formally expelled Cincinnati for violating a rule that would not actually go into effect for two more months.\n\nCincinnati's expulsion from the National League incensed ''Cincinnati Enquirer'' sports editor [[O. P. Caylor]], who made two attempts to form a new league on behalf of the receivers for the now bankrupt Reds franchise. When these attempts failed, he formed a new independent ballclub known as the Red Stockings in the Spring of 1881, and brought the team to St. Louis for a weekend exhibition. The Reds' first game was a 12\u20133 victory over the St. Louis club. After the 1881 series proved a success, Caylor and a former president of the old Reds named Justus Thorner received an invitation from Philadelphia businessman Horace Phillips to attend a meeting of several clubs in Pittsburgh with the intent of establishing a rival to the National League. Upon arriving in the city, however, Caylor and Thorner discovered that no other owners had decided to accept the invitation, with even Phillips not bothering to attend his own meeting. By chance, the duo met a former pitcher named Al Pratt, who hooked them up with former Pittsburgh Alleghenys president H. Denny McKnight. Together, the three men hatched a scheme to form a new league by sending a telegram to each of the other owners who were supposed to attend the meeting stating that he was the only person who did not attend and that everyone else was enthusiastic about the new venture and eager to attend a second meeting in Cincinnati. The ploy worked, and the American Association was officially formed at the Hotel Gibson in Cincinnati with the new Reds a charter member with Thorner as president.\n\nLed by the hitting of third baseman [[Hick Carpenter]], the defense of future [[Hall of Fame]] second baseman [[Bid McPhee]], and the pitching of 40-game-winner [[Will White]], the Reds won the inaugural AA pennant in 1882. With the establishment of the [[Union Association]] Justus Thorner left the club to finance the [[Cincinnati Outlaw Reds]] and managed to acquire the lease on the Reds Bank Street Grounds playing field, forcing new president Aaron Stern to relocate three blocks away at the hastily built League Park. The club never placed higher than second or lower than fifth for the rest of its tenure in the American Association.\n\n===The National League returns to Cincinnati (1890\u20131911)===\n[[File:Cincinnati Reds.jpg|thumb|left|Cincinnati Reds baseball team in 1909]]\nThe Cincinnati Red Stockings left the American Association on November 14, 1889 and joined the National League along with the Brooklyn Bridegrooms after a dispute with St. Louis Browns owner Chris Von Der Ahe over the selection of a new league president. The National League was happy to accept the teams in part due to the emergence of the new Player's League. This new league, an early failed attempt to break the [[reserve clause]] in baseball, threatened both existing leagues. Because the National League decided to expand while the American Association was weakening, the team accepted an invitation to join the National League. It was also at this time that the team first shortened their name from \"Red Stockings\" to \"Reds\". The Reds wandered through the 1890s signing local stars and aging veterans. During this time, the team never finished above third place (1897) and never closer than 10\u00bd games (1890).\n\nAt the start of the 20th century, the Reds had hitting stars [[Sam Crawford]] and [[Cy Seymour]]. Seymour's .377 average in 1905 was the first individual batting crown won by a Red. In 1911, [[Bob Bescher]] stole 81 bases, which is still a team record. Like the previous decade, the 1900s (decade) were not kind to the Reds, as much of the decade was spent in the league's [[first division (baseball)|second division]].\n\n===Redland Field to the Great Depression (1912\u20131932)===\n[[File:Edd Roush Baseball.jpg|thumb|150px|Hall of famer [[Edd Roush]] led Cincinnati to the 1919 World Series.]]In 1912, the club opened a new steel-and-concrete ballpark, [[Redland Field]] (later to be known as [[Crosley Field]]). The Reds had been playing baseball on that same site, the corner of Findlay and Western Avenues on the city's west side, for 28 years, in wooden structures that had been occasionally damaged by fires. By the late 1910s the Reds began to come out of the second division. The 1918 team finished fourth, and new manager [[Pat Moran]] led the Reds to an NL [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]] in 1919, in what the club advertised as its \"Golden Anniversary\". The 1919 team had hitting stars [[Edd Roush]] and [[Heinie Groh]] while the pitching staff was led by [[Hod Eller]] and left-hander [[Slim Sallee|Harry \"Slim\" Sallee]]. The Reds finished ahead of [[John McGraw (baseball)|John McGraw's]] [[1919 New York Giants season|New York Giants]], and then won the [[world championship]] in eight games over the [[1919 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]].\n\nBy 1920, the [[Black Sox Scandal|\"Black Sox\" scandal]] had brought a taint to the Reds' first championship. After 1926, and well into the 1930s, the Reds were second division dwellers. [[Eppa Rixey]], [[Dolf Luque]] and [[Pete Donohue]] were pitching stars, but the offense never lived up to the pitching. By 1931, the team was bankrupt, the [[Great Depression]] was in full swing and Redland Field was in a state of disrepair.\n\n===Championship baseball and revival (1933\u20131940)===\n[[Powel Crosley, Jr.]], an electronics [[business magnate|magnate]] who, with his brother [[Lewis M. Crosley]], produced radios, refrigerators, and other household items, bought the Reds out of bankruptcy in 1933, and hired [[Larry MacPhail]] to be the General Manager. Crosley had started [[WLW]] radio, the Reds flagship radio broadcaster, and the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] in Cincinnati, where he was also a prominent civic leader. MacPhail began to develop the Reds' [[minor league baseball|minor league system]] and expanded the Reds' fan base. The Reds, throughout the 1930s, became a team of \"firsts\". The now-renamed [[Crosley Field]] became the host of the first night game in 1935, which was also the first baseball fireworks night, the fireworks at the game were shot by Joe Rozzi of Rozzi's Famous Fireworks. [[Johnny Vander Meer]] became the only pitcher in major league history to throw back-to-back no-hitters in 1938. Thanks to Vander Meer, [[Paul Derringer]] and second baseman/third baseman-turned-[[pitcher]] [[Bucky Walters]], the Reds had a solid pitching staff. The offense came around in the late 1930s. By 1938 the Reds, now led by manager [[Bill McKechnie]], were out of the second division finishing fourth. [[Ernie Lombardi]] was named the National League's Most Valuable Player in 1938. By 1939, they were National League champions, but in the World Series, they were swept by the [[New York Yankees]]. In 1940, they repeated as NL Champions, and for the first time in 21 years, the Reds captured a World championship, beating the [[1940 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] 4 games to 3. [[Frank McCormick]] was the 1940 NL MVP. Other position players included [[Harry Craft]], [[Lonny Frey]], [[Ival Goodman]], [[Lew Riggs]] and [[Bill Werber]].\n\n===1941\u20131969===\n[[File:Crosley Field 1969.jpg|thumb|250px|The Reds played at [[Crosley Field]], pictured here in 1969, from 1912 to 1970.]]\nWorld War II and age finally caught up with the Reds. Throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, Cincinnati finished mostly in the second division. In 1944, [[Joe Nuxhall]] (who was later to become part of the radio broadcasting team), at age 15, pitched for the Reds on loan from Wilson Junior High school in Hamilton, Ohio. He became the youngest player ever to appear in a major league game\u2014a record that still stands today. Ewell \"The Whip\" Blackwell was the main pitching stalwart before arm problems cut short his career. [[Ted Kluszewski]] was the NL home run leader in 1954. The rest of the offense was a collection of over-the-hill players and not-ready-for-prime-time youngsters.\n\nIn April 1953, the Reds announced a preference to be called the \"Redlegs\", saying that the name of the club had been \"Red Stockings\" and then \"Redlegs\". A newspaper speculated that it was due to the developing political connotation of the word 'red' to mean [[Communism]].<ref>{{cite news |work=The Day (New London, Connecticut)|title=Ins and Outs |last=DeGange |first=John|page=10|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F-wgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LHIFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1920,2741323&dq=red+legs+name+change&hl=en |date=16 April 1953 |accessdate=27 May 2015}}</ref> From 1956 to 1960, the club's logo was altered to remove the term \"REDS\" from the inside of the \"wishbone ''C''{{-\"}} symbol. The \"REDS\" reappeared on the 1961 uniforms, but the point of the ''C'' was removed, leaving a smooth, non-wishbone curve. The traditional home-uniform logo was restored in 1967.\n\nIn 1956, led by National League [[MLB Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] [[Frank Robinson]], the Redlegs hit 221 HR to tie the NL record. By 1961, Robinson was joined by [[Vada Pinson]], [[Wally Post]], [[Gordy Coleman]], and [[Gene Freese]]. Pitchers [[Joey Jay]], [[Jim O'Toole]], and [[Bob Purkey]] led the staff.\n\nThe Reds captured the 1961 National League pennant, holding off the [[1961 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and the [[1961 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], only to be defeated by the perennially powerful [[1961 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]] in the [[1961 World Series|World Series]].\n\nThe Reds had winning teams during the rest of the 1960s, but did not produce any championships. They won 98 games in 1962, paced by Purkey's 23, but finished third. In 1964, they lost the pennant by one game to the Cardinals after having taken first place when the Phillies collapsed in September. Their beloved manager [[Fred Hutchinson]] died of cancer just weeks after the end of the 1964 season. The failure of the Reds to win the 1964 pennant led to owner [[Bill DeWitt]]'s selling off key components of the team, in anticipation of relocating the franchise. In response to DeWitt's threatened move, the women of Cincinnati banded together to form the [[Rosie Reds]] to urge DeWitt to keep the franchise in Cincinnati. The Rosie Reds are still in existence, and are currently the oldest fan club in Major League Baseball. After the 1965 season he executed what may be the most lopsided trade in baseball history, sending former Most Valuable Player Frank Robinson to the Baltimore Orioles for pitchers [[Milt Pappas]] and [[Jack Baldschun]], and outfielder [[Dick Simpson]]. Robinson went on to win the MVP and triple crown in the American league for 1966, and lead Baltimore to its first ever World Series title in a sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Reds did not recover from this trade until the rise of the \"Big Red Machine\" of the 1970s.\n\nStarting in the early 1960s, the Reds' farm system began producing a series of stars, including [[Jim Maloney]] (the Reds' pitching ace of the 1960s), [[Pete Rose]], [[Tony P\u00e9rez]], [[Johnny Bench]], [[Lee May]], [[Tommy Helms]], [[Bernie Carbo]], [[Hal McRae]], [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]], and [[Gary Nolan (baseball)|Gary Nolan]]. The tipping point came in 1967 with the appointment of [[Bob Howsam]] as general manager. That same year the Reds avoided a move to San Diego when the city of Cincinnati and Hamilton County agreed to build a state of the art, downtown stadium on the edge of the Ohio River. The Reds entered into a 30-year lease in exchange for the stadium commitment keeping the franchise in its original home city. In a series of strategic moves, Howsam brought in key personnel to complement the homegrown talent. The Reds' final game at Crosley Field, home to more than 4,500 baseball games, was played on June 24, 1970, a 5\u20134 victory over the [[1970 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]].\n\nUnder Howsam's administration starting in the late 1960s, the Reds instituted a strict rule barring the team's players from wearing facial hair and long hair. The clean cut look was meant to present the team as wholesome in an era of turmoil. All players coming to the Reds were required to shave and cut their hair for the next three decades. Over the years, the rule was controversial, but persisted well into the ownership of [[Marge Schott]]. On at least one occasion, in the early 1980s, enforcement of this rule lost them the services of star reliever and [[Ohio]] native [[Rollie Fingers]], who would not shave his trademark handlebar mustache in order to join the team.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/22/sports/sports-people-fingers-won-t-conform.html | work=The New York Times | title=Sports People; Fingers Won't Conform | date=February 22, 1986 | accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> The rule was not officially rescinded until 1999 when the Reds traded for slugger [[Greg Vaughn]], who had a goatee. The [[New York Yankees]] continue to have a [[Logos and uniforms of the New York Yankees#Personal appearance|similar rule]] today, though unlike the Reds during this period, Yankees players are permitted to have mustaches. Much like when players leave the Yankees today, players who left the Reds took advantage with their new teams; [[Pete Rose]], for instance, grew his hair out much longer than would be allowed by the Reds once he signed with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in 1979.\n\nThe Reds' rules also included conservative uniforms. In Major League Baseball, a club generally provides most of the equipment and clothing needed for play. However, players are required to supply their gloves and shoes themselves. Many players enter into sponsorship arrangements with shoe manufacturers, but through the mid-1980s, the Reds had a strict rule that players were to wear only plain black shoes with no prominent logo. Reds players decried what they considered to be the boring color choice as well as the denial of the opportunity to earn more money through shoe contracts. A compromise was struck in 1985 in which players could paint red marks on their black shoes, then the following year, they were allowed to wear all-red shoes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/sports/scouting-times-change-but-reds-don-t.html |title=SCOUTING; Times Change, But Reds Don't |last=Rogers |first=Thomas |date=February 28, 1986 |website=New York Times |access-date=April 21, 2018 |quote=For years, the Reds were the only team that permitted no color other than the standard black on their uniform shoes. But last year they allowed the players to paint red stripes on the shoes, and this year they're going to all-red models. ''The shoes are all supposed to match our red stockings,'' says a cautious Mrs. Schott. ''I just hope they don't come out shocking pink.''}}</ref>\n\n===The Big Red Machine (1970\u20131976)===\n[[File:Riverfront stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Riverfront Stadium]], 1992]]\nIn {{baseball year|1970}}, little known [[Sparky Anderson|George \"Sparky\" Anderson]] was hired as manager, and the Reds embarked upon a decade of excellence, with a team that came to be known as \"[[The Big Red Machine]]\". Playing at Crosley Field until June 30, 1970, when the Reds moved into brand-new [[Riverfront Stadium]], a 52,000 seat multi-purpose venue on the shores of the [[Ohio River]], the Reds began the 1970s with a bang by winning 70 of their first 100 games. [[Johnny Bench]], [[Tony P\u00e9rez]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Lee May]] and [[Bobby Tolan]] were the early Red Machine offensive leaders; [[Gary Nolan (baseball)|Gary Nolan]], [[Jim Merritt]], [[Wayne Simpson]] and [[Jim McGlothlin]] led a pitching staff which also contained veterans [[Tony Cloninger]] and [[Clay Carroll]] and youngsters [[Pedro Borb\u00f3n]] and [[Don Gullett]]. The Reds breezed through the 1970 season, winning the NL West and captured the NL pennant by sweeping the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in three games. By the time the club got to the [[1970 World Series|World Series]], however, the Reds pitching staff had run out of gas and the veteran [[Baltimore Orioles]], led by Hall of Fame third baseman and World Series MVP [[Brooks Robinson]], beat the Reds in five games.\n\nAfter the disastrous {{baseball year|1971}} [[1971 Major League Baseball season|season]] (the only season of the 1970s during which the Reds finished with a losing record) the Reds reloaded by trading veterans [[Jimmy Stewart (baseball)|Jimmy Stewart]], May, and [[Tommy Helms]] for [[Joe Morgan]], [[C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo]], [[Jack Billingham]], [[Ed Armbrister]], and [[Denis Menke]]. Meanwhile, [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] blossomed at [[shortstop]]. 1971 was also the year a key component of the future world championships was acquired in [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]] from the San Francisco Giants in a trade for shortstop [[Frank Duffy (baseball)|Frank Duffy]].\n\nThe {{baseball year|1972}} [[1972 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the NL West in baseball's first ever [[1972 Major League Baseball strike|strike-shortened]] [[1972 Major League Baseball season|season]] and defeated the [[1972 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in an exciting [[1972 National League Championship Series|five-game playoff series]]. They then faced the [[1972 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1972 World Series|World Series]]. Six of the seven games were won by one run. With powerful slugger [[Reggie Jackson]] sidelined by an injury incurred during Oakland's [[1972 American League Championship Series|playoff series]], Ohio native [[Gene Tenace]] got a chance to play in the series, delivering four home runs that tied the World Series record for homers, propelling Oakland to a dramatic seven-game series win. This was one of the few World Series in which no starting pitcher for either side pitched a complete game.\n\nThe [[1973 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won a third NL West crown in {{baseball year|1973}} after a dramatic second half comeback, that saw them make up {{frac|10|1|2}} games on the [[1973 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] after the [[1973 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star break]]. However they lost the NL pennant to the [[1973 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] in five games in the [[1973 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. In game one, [[Tom Seaver]] faced Jack Billingham in a classic pitching duel, with all three runs of the 2\u20131 margin being scored on home runs. [[John Milner]] provided New York's run off Billingham, while Pete Rose tied the game in the seventh inning off Seaver, setting the stage for a dramatic game ending home run by Johnny Bench in the bottom of the ninth. The New York series provided plenty of controversy with the riotous behavior of [[Shea Stadium]] fans towards Pete Rose when he and [[Bud Harrelson]] scuffled after a hard slide by Rose into Harrelson at second base during the fifth inning of Game 3. A full bench-clearing fight resulted after Harrelson responded to Rose's aggressive move to prevent him from completing a double play by calling him a name. This also led to two more incidents in which play was stopped. The Reds trailed 9\u20133 and New York's manager, [[Yogi Berra]], and legendary outfielder [[Willie Mays]], at the request of National League president [[Warren Giles]], appealed to fans in left field to restrain themselves. The next day the series was extended to a fifth game when Rose homered in the 12th inning to tie the series at two games each.\n\nThe Reds won 98 games in {{baseball year|1974}} but they finished second to the 102-win [[1974 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]]. The [[1974 Major League Baseball season|1974 season]] started off with much excitement, as the [[1974 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] were in town to open the season with the Reds. [[Hank Aaron]] entered opening day with 713 home runs, one shy of tying Babe Ruth's record of 714. The first pitch Aaron swung at in the 1974 season was the record tying home run off Jack Billingham. The next day the Braves benched Aaron, hoping to save him for his record breaking home run on their season opening homestand. The commissioner of baseball, [[Bowie Kuhn]], ordered Braves management to play Aaron the next day, where he narrowly missed the historic home run in the fifth inning. Aaron went on to set the record in Atlanta two nights later. The 1974 season was also the debut of Hall of Fame radio announcer [[Marty Brennaman]], who replaced [[Al Michaels]], after Michaels left the Reds to broadcast for the [[San Francisco Giants]].\n\nWith 1975, the Big Red Machine lineup solidified with the \"Great Eight\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Kelly|title=Big Red Machine's \"Great Eight\" to reunite at GABP|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/23302499/big-red-machines-great-eight-reuniting-for-joe-morgan-weekend|work=FOX 19|publisher=FOX19-WXIX|accessdate=6 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Pahigian|first=Joshua|title=The Ultimate Baseball Road-Trip: A Fan's Guide to Major League Stadiums|year=2004|publisher=Lyons Press|location=Guilford, Conn|isbn=1592281591|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FM1YtoSZEnAC&lpg=PA208&dq=%22Great%20Eight%22%20reds&pg=PA208#v=onepage&q=%22Great%20Eight%22%20reds&f=false|author2=Kevin O'Connell}}</ref> starting team of [[Johnny Bench]] (catcher), [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] (first base), [[Joe Morgan]] (second base), [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] (shortstop), [[Pete Rose]] (third base), [[Ken Griffey, Sr.|Ken Griffey]] (right field), [[C\u00e9sar Ger\u00f3nimo]] (center field), and [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]] (left field). The starting pitchers included [[Don Gullett]], [[Fred Norman]], [[Gary Nolan (baseball)|Gary Nolan]], [[Jack Billingham]], [[Pat Darcy]], and [[Clay Kirby]]. The bullpen featured [[Rawly Eastwick]] and [[Will McEnaney]] combining for 37 saves, and veterans [[Pedro Borb\u00f3n]] and [[Clay Carroll]]. On Opening Day, Rose still played in left field, Foster was not a starter, while [[John Vukovich]], an off-season acquisition, was the starting third baseman. While Vuckovich was a superb fielder, he was a weak hitter. In May, with the team off to a slow start and trailing the Dodgers, Sparky Anderson made a bold move by moving Rose to third base, a position where he had very little experience, and inserting Foster in left field. This was the jolt that the Reds needed to propel them into first place, with Rose proving to be reliable on defense, while adding Foster to the outfield gave the offense some added punch. During the season, the Reds compiled two notable streaks: (1) by winning 41 out of 50 games in one stretch, and (2) by going a month without committing any errors on defense.\n[[File:Pete rose at bat.jpg|thumb|[[Pete Rose]] at bat in a game at Dodger Stadium during the 1970s]]\n\nIn the [[1975 Major League Baseball season|1975 season]], [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] clinched the NL West with 108 victories, then swept the [[1975 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]] in three games to win the NL pennant. In the [[1975 World Series|World Series]], the [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|Boston Red Sox]] were the opponents. After splitting the first four games, the Reds took Game 5. After a three-day rain delay, the two teams met in Game 6, one of the most memorable baseball games ever played and considered by many to be the best World Series game ever. The Reds were ahead 6\u20133 with 5 outs left, when the Red Sox tied the game on former Red [[Bernie Carbo]]'s three-run [[home run]]. It was Carbo's second pinch-hit three-run homer in the series. After a few close-calls either way, [[Carlton Fisk]] hit a dramatic 12th inning [[home run]] off the [[foul pole]] in left field to give the Red Sox a 7\u20136 win and force a deciding Game 7. Cincinnati prevailed the next day when Morgan's [[run batted in|RBI]] [[single (baseball)|single]] won Game 7 and gave the Reds their first championship in 35 years. The Reds have not lost a World Series game since Carlton Fisk's home run, a span of 9 straight wins.\n\n1976 saw a return of the same starting eight in the field. The starting rotation was again led by Nolan, Gullett, Billingham, and Norman, while the addition of rookies [[Pat Zachry]] and [[Santo Alcal\u00e1]] comprised an underrated staff in which four of the six had ERAs below 3.10. Eastwick, Borbon, and McEnaney shared closer duties, recording 26, 8, and 7 saves respectively. The [[1976 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the NL West by ten games. They went undefeated in the postseason, sweeping the [[1976 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] (winning Game 3 in their final at-bat) to return to the [[1976 World Series|World Series]]. They continued to dominate by sweeping the [[1976 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the newly renovated [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], the first World Series games played in Yankee Stadium since 1964. This was only the second ever sweep of the Yankees in the World Series. In winning the Series, the Reds became the first NL team since the 1921\u201322 [[New York Giants]] to win consecutive World Series championships, and the Big Red Machine of 1975\u201376 is considered one of the best teams ever. So far in MLB history, the 1975 and '76 Reds were the last NL team to [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason streaks|repeat as champions]].\n\nBeginning with the 1970 National League pennant, the Reds beat either of the two Pennsylvania-based clubs, the [[Phillies\u2013Pirates rivalry|Philadelphia Phillies or the Pittsburgh Pirates]] to win their pennants (Pirates in 1970, 1972, 1975, and 1990, Phillies in 1976), making The Big Red Machine part of the rivalry between the two Pennsylvania teams. In 1979, [[Pete Rose]] added further fuel in The Big Red Machine being part of the rivalry when he signed with the Phillies and helped them win their first World Series championship in {{wsy|1980}}.\n\n===The Machine dismantled (1977\u20131989)===\nThe later years of the 1970s brought turmoil and change. Popular [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] was sent to [[Montreal Expos|Montreal]] after the 1976 season, breaking up the Big Red Machine's starting lineup. Manager Sparky Anderson and General Manager [[Bob Howsam]] later considered this trade the biggest mistake of their careers. Starting pitcher [[Don Gullett]] left via free agency and signed with the New York Yankees. In an effort to fill that gap, a trade with the [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]] for starting ace [[Vida Blue]] was arranged during the 1976\u201377 off-season. However, Bowie Kuhn, the Commissioner of Baseball, vetoed the trade for the stated reason of maintaining competitive balance in baseball. Some have suggested that the actual reason had more to due with Kuhn's continued feud with Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley. On June 15, 1977, the Reds acquired Mets' franchise pitcher [[Tom Seaver]] for Pat Zachry, [[Doug Flynn]], Steve Henderson, and Dan Norman. In other deals that proved to be less successful, the Reds traded Gary Nolan to the Angels for Craig Hendrickson, Rawly Eastwick to St. Louis for [[Doug Capilla]] and [[Mike Caldwell (baseball)|Mike Caldwell]] to Milwaukee for Rick O'Keeffe and Garry Pyka, and got [[Rick Auerbach]] from Texas. The end of the Big Red Machine era was heralded by the replacement of General Manager Bob Howsam with [[Dick Wagner (baseball)|Dick Wagner]].\n\nIn Rose's last season as a Red, he gave baseball a thrill as he challenged [[Joe DiMaggio]]'s 56-game hitting streak, tying for the second-longest streak ever at 44 games. The streak came to an end in Atlanta after striking out in his fifth at bat in the game against [[Gene Garber]]. Rose also earned his 3,000th hit that season, on his way to becoming baseball's all-time hits leader when he rejoined the Reds in the mid-1980s. The year also witnessed the only no-hitter of Hall of Fame pitcher Tom Seaver's career, coming against the [[1978 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] on June 16, 1978.\n\nAfter the [[1978 Major League Baseball season|1978 season]] and two straight second-place finishes, Wagner fired manager Anderson\u2014an unpopular move. Pete Rose, who since 1963 had played almost every position for the team except pitcher, shortstop, and catcher, signed with Philadelphia as a free agent. By 1979, the starters were Bench (c), [[Dan Driessen]] (1b), Morgan (2b), Concepci\u00f3n (ss), [[Ray Knight]] (3b), with Griffey, Foster, and Geronimo again in the outfield. The pitching staff had experienced a complete turnover since 1976 except for Fred Norman. In addition to ace starter [[Tom Seaver]]; the remaining starters were [[Mike LaCoss]], [[Bill Bonham]], and [[Paul Moskau]]. In the bullpen, only Borbon had remained. [[Dave Tomlin]] and [[Mario Soto (baseball)|Mario Soto]] worked middle relief with [[Tom Hume]] and [[Doug Bair]] closing. The [[1979 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won the 1979 NL West behind the pitching of Tom Seaver but were dispatched in the [[1979 National League Championship Series|NL playoffs]] by [[1979 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh]]. Game 2 featured a controversial play in which a ball hit by Pittsburgh's [[Phil Garner]] was caught by Cincinnati outfielder [[Dave Collins]] but was ruled a trap, setting the Pirates up to take a 2\u20131 lead. The Pirates swept the series 3 games to 0 and went on to win the World Series against the [[Baltimore Orioles]].\n\nThe [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|1981 team]] fielded a strong lineup, but with only Concepci\u00f3n, Foster, and Griffey retaining their spots from the 1975\u201376 heyday.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1976.shtml |title=1976 Cincinnati Reds Statistics and Roster|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1981.shtml |title=1981 Cincinnati Reds Statistics and Roster|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-30}}</ref> After Johnny Bench was able to play only a few games at catcher each year after 1980 due to ongoing injuries, [[Joe Nolan]] took over as starting catcher. Driessen and Bench shared 1st base, and Knight starred at third. Morgan and Geronimo had been replaced at second base and center field by [[Ron Oester]] and Dave Collins. Mario Soto posted a banner year starting on the mound, only surpassed by the outstanding performance of Seaver's Cy Young runner-up season. La Coss, [[Bruce Berenyi]], and [[Frank Pastore]] rounded out the starting rotation. Hume again led the bullpen as closer, joined by Bair and [[Joe Price (pitcher)|Joe Price]]. In {{baseball year|1981}}, [[1981 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] had the best overall record in baseball, but they finished second in the division in both of the half-seasons that were created after a mid-season players' [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike]], and missed the playoffs. To commemorate this, a team photo was taken, accompanied by a banner that read \"Baseball's Best Record 1981\".\n\nBy {{baseball year|1982}}, the [[1982 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] were a shell of the original Red Machine; they lost 101 games that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CIN/1982_sched.shtml |title=1982 Cincinnati Reds Schedule, Box Scores and Splits|publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=2008-03-30 |work= }}</ref> Johnny Bench, after an unsuccessful transition to 3rd base, retired a year later.\n\nAfter the heartbreak of 1981, General Manager Dick Wagner pursued the strategy of ridding the team of veterans including third-baseman Knight and the entire starting outfield of Griffey, Foster, and Collins. Bench, after being able to catch only seven games in 1981, was moved from platooning at first base to be the starting third baseman; [[Alex Trevi\u00f1o]] became the regular starting catcher. The outfield was staffed with [[Paul Householder]], [[C\u00e9sar Cede\u00f1o]], and future [[Colorado Rockies]] & [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] manager [[Clint Hurdle]] on opening day. Hurdle was an immediate bust, and rookie [[Eddie Milner]] took his place in the starting outfield early in the year. The highly touted Householder struggled throughout the year despite extensive playing time. Cedeno, while providing steady veteran play, was a disappointment, and was unable to recapture his glory days with the Houston Astros. The starting rotation featured the emergence of a dominant Mario Soto, and featured strong years by Pastore and [[Bruce Berenyi]], but Seaver was injured all year, and their efforts were wasted without a strong offensive lineup. Tom Hume still led the bullpen, along with Joe Price. But the colorful [[Brad Lesley|Brad \"The Animal\" Lesley]] was unable to consistently excel, and former all-star [[Jim Kern]] was a big disappointment. Kern was also publicly upset over having to shave off his prominent beard to join the Reds, and helped force the issue of getting traded during mid-season by growing it back.  The season also saw the midseason firing of Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]], who was replaced as skipper by [[Russ Nixon]].\n\nThe Reds fell to the bottom of the Western Division for the next few years. After the 1982 season, Seaver was traded back to the Mets. The year 1983 found [[Dann Bilardello]] behind the plate, Bench returning to part-time duty at first base, rookies [[Nick Esasky]] taking over at third base and [[Gary Redus]] taking over from Cedeno. Tom Hume's effectiveness as a closer had diminished, and no other consistent relievers emerged. Dave Concepci\u00f3n was the sole remaining starter from the Big Red Machine era.\n\nWagner's tenure ended in 1983, when Howsam, the architect of the Big Red Machine, was brought back. The popular Howsam began his second term as Reds' General Manager by signing Cincinnati native [[Dave Parker]] as a free agent from Pittsburgh. In {{baseball year|1984}} the Reds began to move up, depending on trades and some minor leaguers. In that season Dave Parker, [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] and [[Tony P\u00e9rez]] were in Cincinnati uniforms. In August 1984, [[Pete Rose]] was reacquired and hired to be the Reds player-manager. After raising the franchise from the grave, Howsam gave way to the administration of [[Bill Bergesch]], who attempted to build the team around a core of highly regarded young players in addition to veterans like Parker. However, he was unable to capitalize on an excess of young and highly touted position players including [[Kurt Stillwell]], [[Tracy Jones]], and [[Kal Daniels]] by trading them for pitching. Despite the emergence of Tom Browning as rookie of the year in 1985 when he won 20 games, the rotation was devastated by the early demise of Mario Soto's career to arm injury.\n\nUnder Bergesch, from {{baseball year|1985}}\u2013[[1989 in baseball|89]] the Reds finished second four times. Among the highlights, Rose became the all-time hits leader, [[Tom Browning]] threw a [[perfect game]], [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] became the first player in baseball history to hit at least 35 home runs and steal 50 bases, and [[Chris Sabo]] was the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|1988 National League Rookie of the Year]]. The Reds also had a bullpen star in [[John Franco]], who was with the team from 1984 to 1989. Rose once had Concepci\u00f3n pitch late in a game at Dodger Stadium. Following the release of the [[Dowd Report]] which accused Rose for betting on baseball games, in {{baseball year|1989}} Rose was banned from baseball by [[Commissioner of Baseball|Commissioner]] [[A. Bartlett Giamatti|Bart Giamatti]], who declared Rose guilty of \"conduct detrimental to baseball\". Controversy also swirled around Reds owner [[Marge Schott]], who was accused several times of [[List of ethnic slurs|ethnic and racial slurs]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4D61439F934A35751C1A964958260 |title=BASEBALL; Call for Schott to Step Down|work=New York Times|date=December 7, 1992|accessdate=2008-03-30 }}</ref>\n\n===World Championship and the end of an era (1990\u20132002)===\nIn {{baseball year|1987}}, General Manager Bergesch was replaced by [[Murray Cook (baseball)|Murray Cook]], who initiated a series of deals that would finally bring the Reds back to the championship, starting with acquisitions of [[Danny Jackson]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Rijo]]. An aging Dave Parker was let go after a revival of his career in Cincinnati following the [[Pittsburgh drug trials]]. Barry Larkin emerged as the starting shortstop over Kurt Stillwell, who along with reliever [[Ted Power|Power]], was traded for Jackson. In {{baseball year|1989}}, Cook was succeeded by [[Bob Quinn (baseball grandson)|Bob Quinn]], who put the final pieces of the championship puzzle together, with the acquisitions of [[Hal Morris]], [[Billy Hatcher]] and [[Randy Myers]].\n\n[[File:Eric davis.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]] in 1990]]\nIn {{baseball year|1990}}, the [[1990 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] under new manager [[Lou Piniella]] shocked baseball by leading the NL West from wire-to-wire. Winning their first nine games, they started off 33\u201312 and maintained their lead throughout the year. Led by [[Chris Sabo]], [[Barry Larkin]], [[Eric Davis (baseball)|Eric Davis]], [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] and Billy Hatcher in the field, and by [[Jos\u00e9 Rijo]], Tom Browning and the \"Nasty Boys\" of [[Rob Dibble]], [[Norm Charlton]] and [[Randy Myers]] on the mound, the Reds took out the [[1990 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pirates]] in the [[1990 National League Championship Series|NLCS]]. The Reds swept the heavily favored [[Oakland Athletics]] in four straight, and extended a Reds winning streak in the World Series to nine consecutive games. The World Series, however, saw Eric Davis severely bruise a kidney diving for a fly ball in Game 4, and his play was greatly limited the next year. In winning the World Series the Reds became the only National League team to go wire to wire.\n\nIn {{baseball year|1992}}, Quinn was replaced in the front office by [[Jim Bowden]]. On the field, manager Lou Piniella wanted outfielder Paul O'Neill to be a power-hitter to fill the void Eric Davis left when he was traded to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in exchange for [[Tim Belcher]]. However, O'Neill only hit .246 and 14 homers. The Reds returned to winning after a losing season in 1991, but 90 wins was only enough for second place behind the division-winning [[1992 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]. Before the season ended, Piniella got into an altercation with reliever Rob Dibble. In the off season, [[Paul O'Neill (baseball)|Paul O'Neill]] was traded to the [[New York Yankees]] for outfielder [[Roberto Kelly]]. Kelly was a disappointment for the Reds over the next couple of years, while O'Neill blossomed, leading a down-trodden Yankees franchise to a return to glory. Also, the Reds would replace their \"Big Red Machine\" era uniforms in favor of a pinstriped uniform with no sleeves.\n\nFor the [[1993 Cincinnati Reds season|1993 season]] Piniella was replaced by fan favorite [[Tony P\u00e9rez]], but he lasted only 44 games at the helm, replaced by [[Davey Johnson]]. With Johnson steering the team, the Reds made steady progress. In 1994, the Reds were in the newly created [[National League Central Division]] with the [[Chicago Cubs]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], as well as fellow rivals [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Houston Astros]]. By the time the strike hit, the Reds finished a half-game ahead of the Astros for first-place in the NL Central. By {{baseball year|1995}}, the Reds won the division thanks to [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] [[Barry Larkin]]. After defeating the NL West champion Dodgers in the first NLDS since 1981, they lost to the [[Atlanta Braves]].\n\nTeam owner [[Marge Schott]] announced mid-season that Johnson would be gone by the end of the year, regardless of outcome, to be replaced by former Reds third baseman Ray Knight. Johnson and Schott had never gotten along and she did not approve of Johnson living with his fianc\u00e9e before they were married,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/orioles/longterm/memories/davey/articles/poorcomm.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=May 12, 1998 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 | title=Poor Communication at Heart of Feud}}</ref> In contrast, Knight, along with his wife, professional golfer [[Nancy Lopez]], were friends of Schott. The team took a dive under Knight and he was unable to complete two full seasons as manager, subject to complaints in the press about his strict managerial style.\n\nIn {{baseball year|1999}} the [[1999 Cincinnati Reds season|Reds]] won 96 games, led by manager [[Jack McKeon]], but lost to the [[New York Mets]] in a [[1999 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game|one game playoff]]. Earlier that year, Schott sold controlling interest in the Reds to Cincinnati businessman [[Carl Lindner Jr.|Carl Lindner]]. Despite an 85\u201377 finish in 2000, and being named 1999 NL manager of the year, McKeon was fired after the [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000 season]]. The Reds did not have another winning season until 2010.\n\n===Contemporary era (2003\u2013present)===\n[[File:Gabp.jpg|thumb|GABP opened in 2003, becoming the seventh home field for the Reds.]]\n[[Riverfront Stadium]], by then known as Cinergy Field, was demolished in {{baseball year|2002}}. [[Great American Ball Park]] opened in {{baseball year|2003}} with high expectations for a team led by local favorites, including [[outfielder]] [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]], [[shortstop]] [[Barry Larkin]], and [[first baseman]] [[Sean Casey (baseball)|Sean Casey]]. Although attendance improved considerably with the new ballpark, the team continued to lose. Schott had not invested much in the farm system since the early 1990s, leaving the team relatively thin on talent. After years of promises that the club was rebuilding toward the opening of the new ballpark, General Manager [[Jim Bowden]] and manager [[Bob Boone]] were fired on July 28. This broke up the father-son combo of manager Bob Boone and [[third baseman]] [[Aaron Boone]], and Aaron was soon traded to the [[New York Yankees]]. Tragedy struck in November when [[Dernell Stenson]], a promising young outfielder for the Reds, was shot and killed during a carjack. Following the season [[Dan O'Brien (baseball executive)|Dan O'Brien]] was hired as the Reds' 16th General Manager.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\nThe {{baseball year|2004}} and {{baseball year|2005}} seasons continued the trend of big hitting, poor pitching, and poor records. Griffey, Jr. joined the [[500 home run club]] in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/event_hr.cgi?t=b&id=griffke02|title=Ken Griffey Career Home Runs|last=|first=|date=|website=Baseball-Reference.com|publisher=|access-date=January 25, 2017}}</ref> but was again hampered by injuries. [[Adam Dunn]] emerged as consistent home run hitter, including a {{convert|535|ft|m|sing=on}} home run against [[Jos\u00e9 Lima]]. He also broke the major league record for [[strikeouts]] in 2004. Although a number of [[free agent]]s were signed before 2005, the Reds were quickly in last place and manager [[Dave Miley]] was forced out in the [[2005 Major League Baseball season|2005 mid season]] and replaced by [[Jerry Narron]]. Like many other small market clubs, the Reds dispatched some of their veteran players and began entrusting their future to a young nucleus that included [[Adam Dunn]] and [[Austin Kearns]].\n\nLate summer 2004 saw the opening of the [[Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame]] (HOF). The Reds HOF had been in existence in name only since the 1950s, with player plaques, photos and other memorabilia scattered throughout their front offices. Ownership and management desired a stand-alone facility, where the public could walk through inter-active displays, see locker room recreations, watch videos of classic Reds moments and peruse historical items. The first floor houses a movie theater which resembles an older, ivy-covered brick wall ball yard. The hallways contain many vintage photographs. The rear of the building features a three-story wall containing a baseball for every hit [[Pete Rose]] had during his career. The third floor contains interactive exhibits including a pitcher's mound, radio booth, and children's area where the fundamentals of baseball are taught through videos featuring former Reds players.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n[[File:Jeremy Affeldt followthrough 2.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Jeremy Affeldt]] pitching for the Reds in 2008]]\n[[Robert Castellini]] took over as controlling owner from Lindner in 2006. Castellini promptly fired general manager Dan O'Brien and hired [[Wayne Krivsky]]. The Reds made a run at the playoffs but ultimately fell short. The [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]] was again mired in mediocrity. Midway through the season Jerry Narron was fired as manager and replaced by [[Pete Mackanin]]. The Reds ended up posting a winning record under Mackanin, but finished the season in 5th place in the Central Division. Mackanin was manager in an interim capacity only, and the Reds, seeking a big name to fill the spot, ultimately brought in [[Dusty Baker]]. Early in the [[2008 Major League Baseball season|2008 season]], Krivsky was fired and replaced by [[Walt Jocketty]]. Though the Reds did not win under Krivsky, he is credited with revamping the farm system and signing young talent that could potentially lead the Reds to success in the future.\n\nThe Reds failed to post winning records in both 2008 and 2009. In 2010, with [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|NL MVP]] [[Joey Votto]] and [[Gold Glove]]rs [[Brandon Phillips]] and [[Scott Rolen]] the Reds posted a 91-71 record and were NL Central champions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cincinnati.com/blogs/reds/2010/09/28/astros-2-reds-1-after-2/ |title=Reds are NL Central Champs! &#124; Cincinnati Reds |publisher=Cincinnati.com |date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2012-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005022626/http://cincinnati.com/blogs/reds/2010/09/28/astros-2-reds-1-after-2/ |archivedate=2012-10-05 |df= }}</ref> The following week, the Reds became only the second team in MLB history to be no-hit in a postseason game when Philadelphia's [[Roy Halladay]] shut down the National League's number one offense in [[2010 National League Division Series#Game 1, October 6|game one of the NLDS]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/gameday/index.jsp?gid=2010_10_06_cinmlb_phimlb_1&mode=gameday |title=MLB.com At Bat &#124; MLB.com: Gameday |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |date=2010-10-06 |accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref>  The Reds lost in a 3-game sweep of the [[2010 National League Division Series#Philadelphia vs. Cincinnati|NLDS]] to Philadelphia.\n\nAfter coming off their surprising 2010 NL Central Division Title, the Reds fell short of many expectations for the 2011 season. Multiple injuries and inconsistent starting pitching played a big role in their mid-season collapse, along with a less productive offense as compared to the previous year. The Reds ended the season at 79-83. The Reds won the 2012 NL Central Division Title. On September 28, [[Homer Bailey]] threw a 1-0 no-hitter against the Pittsburgh Pirates at PNC Park, this was the first Reds no-hitter since [[Tom Browning's perfect game]] in September of the 1988 season. Finishing with a 97\u201365 record, they earned the second seed in the [[2012 National League Division Series|Division Series]] and a match-up with the eventual World Series champion San Francisco Giants. After taking a 2\u20130 lead with road victories at [[AT&T Park]], they headed home looking to win the series. However, they lost three straight at their home ballpark to become the first National League team since the [[Chicago Cubs|Cubs]] in 1984 to lose a division series after leading 2\u20130.\n\nIn the off-season, the team traded outfielder [[Drew Stubbs]], as part of a three team deal with the [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] and [[Cleveland Indians]], to the Indians, and in turn received right fielder [[Shin-Soo Choo]]. On July 2, 2013, Homer Bailey pitched a no-hitter against the San Francisco Giants for a 4-0 Reds victory, making Bailey the third pitcher in Reds history with two complete game no-hitters in their career.\n\nFollowing six consecutive losses to close out the 2013 season, including a loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, at PNC Park, in the National League wild-card playoff game, the Reds decided to fire Dusty Baker. During his six years as manager, Baker led the Reds to the playoff three times; however, they never advanced beyond the first round.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9767640/dusty-baker-cincinnati-reds-manager-report-says | title=Reds dismiss manager Dusty Baker | publisher=[[ESPN.com]] | date=October 4, 2013 | accessdate=March 11, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn October 22, 2013, the Reds hired pitching coach [[Bryan Price]] to replace Baker as manager.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/10/21/4864796/bryan-price-cincinnati-reds-new-manager|title=Reds set to promote Price to manager|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[Bryan Price]], the Reds were led by pitchers [[Johnny Cueto]] and the hard-throwing Cuban [[Aroldis Chapman]]. While the offense was led by all-star third baseman [[Todd Frazier]], Joey Votto, and Brandon Phillips. Although with plenty of star power, the Reds never got off to a good start and ending the season in lowly fourth place in the division to go along with a 76-86 record. During the offseason, the Reds traded pitchers [[Alfredo Sim\u00f3n]] to the Tigers and [[Mat Latos]] to the Marlins. In return, they acquired young talents such as [[Eugenio Su\u00e1rez]] and [[Anthony DeSclafani]]. They also acquired veteran slugger [[Marlon Byrd]] from the Phillies to play left field.\n\nThe Reds' 2015 season wasn't much better, as they finished with the second worst record in the league with a record of 64-98, their worst finish since 1982. The Reds were forced to trade star pitchers [[Johnny Cueto]] (to the Kansas City Royals) and [[Mike Leake]] (to the San Francisco Giants), receiving minor league pitching prospects for both.  Shortly after the season's end, the Reds traded home run derby champion [[Todd Frazier]] to the Chicago White Sox, and closing pitcher [[Aroldis Chapman]] to the New York Yankees.\n\nIn 2016, the Reds broke the record for home runs allowed during a single season.

The first ballpark the Reds occupied was [[Bank Street Grounds]] from 1882 to 1883 until they moved to [[League Park I (Cincinnati)|League Park I]] in 1884, where they would remain until 1893. Through the late 1890s and early 1900s (decade), the Reds moved to two different parks where they stayed for less than ten years. [[League Park II (Cincinnati)|League Park II]] was the third home field for the Reds from 1894 to 1901, and then moved to the [[Palace of the Fans]] which served as the home of the Reds in the 1910s. It was in 1912 that the Reds moved to [[Crosley Field]] which they called home for fifty-eight years. Crosley served as the home field for the Reds for two [[World Series]] titles and five [[National League]] pennants. Beginning June 30, 1970, and during the dynasty of the Big Red Machine, the Reds played in [[Riverfront Stadium]], appropriately named due to its location right by the [[Ohio River]]. Riverfront saw three World Series titles and five National League pennants. It was in the late 1990s that the city agreed to build two separate stadiums on the riverfront for the Reds and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]]. Thus, in 2003, the Reds began a new era with the opening of the current stadium.\n\nThe Reds hold their spring training in [[Goodyear, Arizona]] at [[Goodyear Ballpark]]. The Reds moved into this stadium and the Cactus League in 2010 after staying in the Grapefruit League for most of their history.

For most of the history of the Reds, especially during the early history, the Reds logo has been simply the wishbone \"C\" with the word \"REDS\" inside, the only colors used being red and white. However, during the 1950s, during the renaming and re-branding of the team as the Cincinnati Redlegs because of the connections to communism of the word 'Reds', the color blue was introduced as part of the Reds color combination.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yglesias |first=Matthew |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/03/communist_bo_xilai_gets_ousted_why_do_communists_like_red_so_much_.html |title=Communist Bo Xilai gets ousted: Why do communists like red so much?|work=Slate Magazine|accessdate=2012-06-19}}</ref> During the 1960s and 1970s the Reds saw a move towards the more traditional colors, abandoning the navy blue. A new logo also appeared with the new era of baseball in 1972, when the team went away from the script \"REDS\" inside of the \"C\", instead, putting their mascot Mr. Redlegs in its place as well as putting the name of the team inside of the wishbone \"C\". In the 1990s the more traditional, early logos of Reds came back with the current logo reflecting more of what the team's logo was when they were first founded.\n\n===Uniform===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header    = \n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer    =\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background = \n | width1    = 160\n | image1    = Scott Rolen on June 25, 2011.jpg\n | caption1  = [[Scott Rolen]] wearing the current Reds away uniform, featuring classic lettering.\n | width2    = 160\n | image2    = \n | caption2  = \n | width3    = \n}}\nAlong with the logo, the Reds' uniforms have been changed many different times throughout their history. Following their departure from being called the \"Redlegs\" in 1956 the Reds made a groundbreaking change to their uniforms with the use of sleeveless jerseys, seen only once before in the Major Leagues by the Chicago Cubs. At home and away, the cap was all-red with a white wishbone C insignia. The long-sleeved undershirts were red. The uniform was plain white with a red wishbone C logo on the left and the uniform number on the right. On the road the wishbone C was replaced by the mustachioed \"Mr. Red\" logo, the pillbox-hat-wearing man with a baseball for a head. The home stockings were red with six white stripes. The away stockings had only three white stripes.\n\nThe Reds changed uniforms again in 1961, when they replaced the traditional wishbone C insignia with an oval C logo, but continued to use the sleeveless jerseys. At home, the Reds wore white caps with the red bill with the oval C in red, white sleeveless jerseys with red pinstripes, with the oval C-REDS logo in black with red lettering on the left breast and the number in red on the right. The gray away uniform included a gray cap with the red oval C and a red bill. Their gray away uniforms, which also included a sleeveless jersey, bore CINCINNATI in an arched block style across with the number below on the left. In 1964, players' last names were placed on the back of each set of uniforms, below the numbers. Those uniforms were scrapped after the 1966 season.\n\nHowever, the Cincinnati uniform design most familiar to baseball enthusiasts is the one whose basic form, with minor variations, held sway for the 26 seasons from 1967 to 1992. Most significantly, the point was restored to the C insignia, making it a wishbone again. During this era, the Reds wore all-red caps both at home and on the road. The caps bore the simple wishbone C insignia in white. The uniforms were standard short-sleeved jerseys and standard trousers\u2014white at home and grey on the road. The home uniform featured the Wishbone C-REDS logo in red with white type on the left breast and the uniform number in red on the right. The away uniform bore CINCINNATI in an arched block style across the front with the uniform number below on the left. Red, long-sleeved undershirts and plain red stirrups over white sanitary stockings completed the basic design.\n\nThe 1993 uniforms (which did away with the pullovers and brought back button-down jerseys) kept white and gray as the base colors for the home and away uniforms, but added red pinstripes. The home jerseys were sleeveless, showing more of the red undershirts. The color scheme of the C-REDS logo on the home uniform was reversed, now red lettering on a white background. A new home cap was created that had a red bill and a white crown with red pinstripes and a red wishbone C insignia. The away uniform kept the all-red cap, but moved the uniform number to the left, to more closely match the home uniform. The only additional change to these uniforms was the introduction of black as a primary color of the Reds in 1999, especially on their road uniforms.\n\nThe Reds latest uniform change came in December 2006 which differed significantly from the uniforms worn during the previous eight seasons. The home caps returned to an all-red design with a white wishbone C, lightly outlined in black. Caps with red crowns and a black bill became the new road caps. Additionally, the sleeveless jersey was abandoned for a more traditional design. The numbers and lettering for the names on the backs of the jerseys were changed to an early-1900s style typeface, and a handlebar mustached \"Mr. Redlegs\" \u2013 reminiscent of the logo used by the Reds in the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 was placed on the left sleeve.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sheldon|first=Mark|title=Reds unveil new-look uniforms|url=http://m.reds.mlb.com/news/article/1749424/|publisher=Major League Baseball Advanced Media|date=December 1, 2006|accessdate=January 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and accolades==\n{{Main article|Cincinnati Reds award winners and league leaders}}\n{{See also|Cincinnati Reds team records}}\n\n===Team captains===\n*[[Jake Daubert]] 1919\u20131924\n*14 [[Pete Rose]] 1970\u20131978\n*13 [[Dave Concepci\u00f3n]] 1983\u20131988\n*11 [[Barry Larkin]] 1997\u20132004\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{{See also|List of Major League Baseball retired numbers}}\nThe Cincinnati Reds have retired ten numbers in franchise history, as well as honoring [[Jackie Robinson]], whose number is retired league-wide around Major League Baseball.\n\nAll of the retired numbers are located at Great American Ball Park behind home-plate on the outside of the press box.

The winner of the game each year was awarded the Ohio Cup in postgame ceremonies. The Ohio Cup was a favorite among baseball fans in Columbus, with attendances regularly topping 15,000.\n\nThe Ohio Cup games ended with the introduction of regular-season [[interleague play]] in 1997. Thereafter, the two teams competed annually in the regular-season Battle of Ohio or Buckeye Series.

Ingredients may include garlic, onions, scotch bonnet peppers, celery, green onions, and herbs like culantro, marjoram, rosemary, tarragon and thyme. This green seasoning is used for a variety of dishes like curries, stews and roasted meats.<ref>[http://latinfood.about.com/od/seasoningmarinade/r/Green-Seasoning.htm Caribbean Green Seasoning Recipe<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nTraditional dishes are so important to regional culture that, for example, the local version of Caribbean goat stew has been chosen as the official national dish of [[Montserrat]] and is also one of the signature dishes of [[St. Kitts and Nevis]].

[[Callaloo]] is a dish containing leafy vegetables[[spinach]] and sometimes [[okra]] amongst others, widely distributed in the Caribbean, with a distinctively mixed African and indigenous character.\n\nThe variety of dessert dishes in the area also reflects the mixed origins of the recipes. In some areas, [[Black Cake]], a derivative of English Christmas pudding may be served, especially on special occasions.\n\nOver time, food from the Caribbean has evolved into a narrative technique through which their culture has been accentuated and promoted. However, by studying Caribbean culture through a literary lens there then runs the risk of generalizing exoticist ideas about food practices from the tropical. Some food theorists argue that this depiction of Caribbean food in various forms of media contributes to the inaccurate conceptions revolving around their culinary practices, which are much more grounded in unpleasant historical events. Therefore, it can be argued that the connection between the idea of the Caribbean being the ultimate paradise and Caribbean food being exotic is based on inaccurate information.<ref>Graziadei, Daniel. \u201cThe Fierce Questioning of Fictional Caribbean Communion in \u00c9douard Glissant\u2019s Ormerod and Fortun\u00e9 Chalumeau\u2019s D\u00e9sirade, \u00f4 Serpente!\u201d In Caribbean Food Cultures: Culinary Practices and Consumption in the Caribbean and Its Diasporas, edited by Wiebke Beuhausen, Anne Br\u00fcske, Ana-Sofia Commichau, Patrick Helber, and Sinah Klo\u00df, 89-96.</ref>\n\n==By location==\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Anguillian cuisine]]\n* [[Antigua and Barbuda cuisine]]\n* [[Barbadian cuisine]]\n* [[Bahamian cuisine]]\n* [[Belizean cuisine]]\n* [[Culture of the Cayman Islands#Cuisine|Cayman Islands cuisine]]\n* [[Colombian cuisine]]\n* [[Costa Rican cuisine]]\n* [[Cuban cuisine]]\n* [[Cura\u00e7ao#Cuisine|Cura\u00e7aoan cuisine]]\n* [[Dominica cuisine]]\n* [[Dominican Republic cuisine]]\n* [[Salvadoran cuisine]]\n* [[French Guianese Cuisine]]\n* [[Culture of Grenada#Cuisine|Grenadan cuisine]]\n* [[Guatemalan cuisine]]\n* [[Guyanese cuisine]]\n* [[Haitian cuisine]]\n* [[Honduran cuisine]]\n* [[Jamaican cuisine]]\n* [[Mexican cuisine]]\n* [[Nicaraguan cuisine]]\n* [[Puerto Rican cuisine]]\n* [[Panamanian cuisine]]\n* [[Culture of Saint Kitts and Nevis#Cuisine|Saint Kitts and Nevis cuisine]]\n* [[Surinamese cuisine]]\n* [[Trinidad and Tobago cuisine|Trinidadian and Tobagonian cuisine]]\n* [[Culture of the Virgin Islands#Cuisine|British Virgin Islands cuisine]]\n* [[Culture of the Virgin Islands#Cuisine|United States Virgin Islands cuisine]]\n* [[Venezuelan cuisine]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Cookbook|Caribbean cuisines}}\n{{Portal|Food|Caribbean}}\n<!-- Please keep list alphabetized -->\n* [[Floribbean cuisine]]\n* [[Ground provisions]]\n* [[List of cuisines]]\n* [[List of street food#Caribbean|Street food]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{cuisine}}\n{{Caribbean topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Caribbean Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Caribbean cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Cuisine of the Americas]]", "sha1": "09g9fb3adyj3z238d9jcrjxgfw3f1kk"}}, {"title": "Central Powers", "ns": "0", "id": "6673", "revision": {"id": "865264708", "parentid": "865264158", "timestamp": "2018-10-22T20:17:41Z", "contributor": {"username": "Brigade Piron", "id": "13068117"}, "comment": "/* Controversial cases */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": " \n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2017}}\n{{distinguish|Axis powers}}\n{{Infobox former country\n|conventional_long_name = Central Powers\n|native_name            = {{native name|de|Mittelm\u00e4chte}}<br />{{native name|hu|K\u00f6zponti hatalmak}}<br />{{native name|tr|\u0130ttifak Devletleri}}<br />{{native name|bg|\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0438\u043b\u0438|italics=no}}\n|common_name            = Central Powers\n|status                 = [[Military alliance]]\n|era                    = World War I\n|date_pre               = 7 October 1879\n|event_pre              = [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]]<br />{{smaller|(Germany{{\\}}Austria-Hungary)}}\n|event_start            =\n|date_start             = 28 June\n|event1                 = {{nowrap|[[Ottoman\u2013German Alliance]]}}\n|date_event1            = 2 August 1914\n|event2                 = [[Bulgaria\u2013Germany treaty (1915)|Bulgaria\u2013Germany treaty]]\n|date_event2            = {{ublist|class=nowrap |6 September 1915 {{smaller|(secret)}} |14 October 1915 {{smaller|(public)}}}}\n|event_end              = [[Dissolution (law)|Dissolved]]\n|date_end               = 11 November\n|year_start             = 1914\n|year_end               = 1918\n|image_map = World War I on 1 August 1914.png\n|loctext =            <!--text description of location of country-->\n|map_caption = Central Powers on 1 August 1914:\n{{legend|Gold|Countries of the Central Powers}}\n{{legend|Yellow|Colonies, protectorates, and territories of the Central Powers}}\n{{legend|GreenYellow|Condominiums between the German Realm and Kingdom of Belgium}}\n|image_map2 = World War I on 11 November 1918.png\n|map_caption2 = Central Powers on 11 November 1918:\n{{legend|Gold|Countries, condominiums, and non-state actors of the Central Powers}}\n{{legend|Yellow|Colonies, occupations, protectorates, and territories of the Central Powers}}\n----\n{{plainlist|style = padding-left: 0.6em;

The Powers' origin was the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary in 1879]]. Despite having joined the alliance before, Italy refused to take part in World War I on the side of the Central Powers; the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria did not join until after World War I had begun, even though the Ottoman Empire had retained close relations with both Germany and Austria-Hungary since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\n== Member states ==\nThe Central Powers consisted of the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] at the beginning of the war. The [[Ottoman Empire]] joined the Central Powers later in 1914. In 1915, the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] joined the alliance. The name \"Central Powers\" is derived from the location of these countries; all four (including the other groups that supported them except for [[Finland]] and [[Lithuania]]) were located between the [[Russian Empire]] in the east and [[French Third Republic|France]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in the west. Finland, [[Azerbaijan]], and Lithuania joined them in 1918 before the war ended and after the Russian Empire collapsed.\n\n[[File:World War 1.gif|thumb|upright=1.3|{{ublist|class=nowrap|item_style=padding-bottom:0.2em; |'''Allied and Central Powers during World War I''' |{{color box|#088A08}} Allied Powers |{{color box|#01DF01}} Allied colonies, dominions, territories or occupations |{{color box|#FE9A2E}} Central Powers |{{color box|#F7BE81}} Central Powers' colonies or occupations |{{color box|#BDBDBD}} Neutral countries}}]]\n[[File:FR-WW1-1914.png|thumb|Europe in 1914.]]\n\nThe Central Powers were composed of the following nations:<ref name=\"meyer\">{{cite book |title=A World Undone: The Story of the Great War, 1914 to 1918 |last=Meyer |first=G.J. |year=2007 |publisher=Delta Trade Paperback |isbn=0-553-38240-3}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable nowrap\"\n!

German History in Modern Times: Four Lives of the Nation. P228.</ref>\n\nAfter Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France.<ref>Tucker, Spencer C. A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East. ABC-CLIO. 2009. P1556.</ref> Germany, facing a two-front war, enacted what was known as the [[Schlieffen Plan]], that involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan was hoped to quickly gain victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This caused [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] to declare war against the German Empire, as the action violated the [[Treaty of London (1839)|Treaty of London]] that both nations signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality and defense of the kingdom if a nation reneged.\n\nSubsequently, several states declared war on Germany in late August 1914, with [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] declaring war on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on 27 August 1916, the [[United States]] declaring war on Germany on 6 April 1917 and [[Kingdom of Greece (Gl\u00fccksburg)|Greece]] declaring war on Germany in July 1917.\n\n==== Colonies and dependencies ====\n{{Main|German colonial empire}}\n; Europe\nUpon its founding in 1871, the German Empire controlled [[Alsace-Lorraine]] as an \"imperial territory\" incorporated from France after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. It was held as part of Germany's sovereign territory.\n\n; Africa\nGermany held multiple African colonies at the time of World War I. All of Germany's African colonies were invaded and occupied by Allied forces during the war.\n\n[[Kamerun|Cameroon]], [[German East Africa]], and [[German Southwest Africa]] were German colonies in Africa. [[Togoland]] was a German protectorate in Africa.\n\n; Asia\n\nThe [[Kiautschou Bay concession]] was a German dependency in East Asia leased from China in 1898. It was occupied by Japanese forces following the [[Siege of Tsingtao]].\n\n; Pacific\n\n[[German New Guinea]] was a German protectorate in the Pacific. It was occupied by Australian forces in 1914.\n\n[[German Samoa]] was a German protectorate following the [[Tripartite Convention]]. It was [[Occupation of German Samoa|occupied]] by the New Zealand Expeditionary Force in 1914.\n\n=== Austria-Hungary ===\n{{Main|Austro-Hungarian entry into World War I|Austria-Hungary}}\n[[File:KuK Stosstruppen.jpg|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers in trench on the Italian front during World War I.]]\n[[File:Austrian troops marching up Mt. Zion, 1916.JPG|thumb|right|Austro-Hungarian soldiers marching up [[Mount Zion]] in [[Jerusalem]] in the Ottoman Empire, during the Middle Eastern campaign.]]\n\n==== War justifications ====\nAustria-Hungary regarded the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] as being orchestrated with the assistance of [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].<ref name=\"Cashman, Greg 2007. P57\" /> The country viewed the assassination as setting a dangerous precedent of encouraging the country's [[South Slavs|South Slav]] population to rebel and threaten to tear apart the multinational country.<ref name=\"Meyer, G.J 1918. P39\" /> Austria-Hungary formally sent an ultimatum to Serbia demanding a full-scale investigation of Serbian government complicity in the assassination, and complete compliance by Serbia in agreeing to the terms demanded by Austria-Hungary.<ref name=\"Cashman, Greg 2007. P57\" /> Serbia submitted to accept most of the demands, however Austria-Hungary viewed this as insufficient and used this lack of full compliance to justify military intervention.<ref name=\"Cashman, Greg 2007. P61\">Cashman, Greg; Robinson, Leonard C. An Introduction to the Causes of War: Patterns of Interstate Conflict from World War I to Iraq. Rowman & Littlefield. 2007. P61</ref> These demands have been viewed as a diplomatic cover for what was going to be an inevitable Austro-Hungarian declaration of war on Serbia.<ref name=\"Cashman, Greg 2007. P61\" />\n\nAustria-Hungary had been warned by Russia that the Russian government would not tolerate Austria-Hungary crushing Serbia.<ref name=\"Cashman, Greg 2007. P61\" /> However, with Germany supporting Austria-Hungary's actions, the Austro-Hungarian government hoped that Russia would not intervene and that the conflict with Serbia would be a regional conflict.<ref name=\"Cashman, Greg 2007. P57\" />\n\nAustria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia resulted in Russia declaring war on the country and Germany in turn declared war on Russia, setting off the beginning of the clash of alliances that resulted in the World War.\n\n; Territory\nAustria-Hungary was internally divided into two states with their own governments, joined in communion through the Habsburg throne. Austrian [[Cisleithania]] contained various duchies and principalities but also the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]]. Hungarian [[Transleithania]] comprised the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] sovereign authority was shared by both Austria and Hungary.\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\n{{Main|Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Muster on the Plain of Esdraelon 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Ottoman soldiers in military preparations for an assault on the [[Suez Canal]] in 1914.]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1981-137-08A, Konstantinopel, Besuch Kaiser Wilhelm II..jpg|thumb|Kaiser Wilhelm II visiting the Turkish cruiser ''Yavuz Sultan Selim'' during his stay in [[Istanbul]] in October 1917 as a guest of Sultan [[Mehmed V]].]]\n\n==== War justifications ====\nThe Ottoman Empire joined the war on the side of the Central Powers in November 1914.

One of the unsuccessful expeditions was led by [[Leo Frobenius]], a celebrated ethnographer and personal friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II.

Thus conservatives from different parts of the world\u2014each upholding their respective traditions\u2014may disagree on a wide range of issues. [[Edmund Burke]], an 18th-century politician who opposed the French Revolution but supported the [[American Revolution]], is credited as one of the main theorists of [[conservatism in the United Kingdom|conservatism in Great Britain in the 1790s]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Frank O'Gorman|title=Edmund Burke: His Political Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U-reNJAnv1oC&pg=PA171|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|page=171|isbn=9780415326841}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]], the chairman of the British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in 1959: \"Conservatism is not so much a philosophy as an attitude, a constant force, performing a timeless function in the development of a free society, and corresponding to a deep and permanent requirement of human nature itself\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Quintin Hogg Baron Hailsham of St. Marylebone|title=The Conservative Case|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=%22+attitude,+a+constant+force,+performing+a+timeless+function+in+the+development+of+a+free+society,+and+corresponding+to+a+deep+and+permanent+requirement+of+human+nature+itself%22&num=10|year=1959|publisher=Penguin Books}}</ref> In contrast to the tradition-based definition of conservatism, some political theorists such as [[Corey Robin]] define conservatism primarily in terms of a general defense of [[Social inequality|social]] and [[economic inequality]].

Individuals should be free to participate in the market and generate wealth without government interference.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} However, individuals cannot be thoroughly depended on to act responsibly in other spheres of life, therefore liberal conservatives believe that a strong state is necessary to ensure law and order and social institutions are needed to nurture a sense of duty and responsibility to the nation.{{sfn|McAnulla|2006|p=71}} Liberal conservatism is a variant of conservatism that is strongly influenced by [[Liberalism|liberal]] stances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xGNRRwkZFysC&pg=PA109|title=Analyzing Politics|last=Grigsby|first=Ellen|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-495-50112-1|location=|pages=108\u201309, 112, 347|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAs these latter two terms have had different meanings over time and across countries, liberal conservatism also has a wide variety of meanings. Historically, the term often referred to the combination of [[Liberal theory of economics|economic liberalism]], which champions ''[[laissez-faire]]'' markets, with the classical conservatism concern for established [[tradition]], respect for authority and religious values. It contrasted itself with [[classical liberalism]], which supported [[Individual freedom|freedom for the individual]] in both the economic and social spheres.\n\nOver time, the general conservative ideology in many countries adopted economic liberal arguments and the term liberal conservatism was replaced with conservatism. This is also the case in countries where liberal economic ideas have been the tradition such as the United States and are thus considered conservative. In other countries where liberal conservative movements have entered the political mainstream, such as [[Italy]] and [[Spain]], the terms liberal and conservative may be synonymous. The liberal conservative tradition in the United States combines the economic [[individualism]] of the classical liberals with a [[Edmund Burke|Burkean]] form of conservatism (which has also become part of the [[American conservatism|American conservative]] tradition, such as in the writings of [[Russell Kirk]]).\n\nA secondary meaning for the term liberal conservatism that has developed in [[Europe]] is a combination of more modern conservative (less traditionalist) views with those of [[social liberalism]]. This has developed as an opposition to the more [[collectivist]] views of [[socialism]]. Often this involves stressing what are now conservative views of [[free market]] economics and belief in individual responsibility, with social liberal views on defence of [[civil rights]], [[environmentalism]] and support for a limited [[welfare state]]. In continental Europe, this is sometimes also translated into [[English language|English]] as social conservatism.\n\n=== Conservative liberalism ===\n{{Main|Conservative liberalism}}\n[[Conservative liberalism]] is a variant of liberalism that combines liberal values and policies with conservative stances, or more simply the right-wing of the liberal movement.<ref>{{fr icon}} [http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm Ipolitique.fr] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319053712/http://www.ipolitique.fr/liberalisme-conservateur.htm |date=March 19, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parties-and-elections.de/contents.html|title=parties-and-elections.de|publisher=}}</ref><ref name=\"Mair\">{{Cite book|title=Representative Government in Europe|last=Gallagher|first=M.|last2=Laver|first2=M.|last3=Mair|first3=P.|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=221|quote=|author-link=Michael Gallagher (academic)|author-link3=Peter Mair|via=}}</ref> The roots of conservative liberalism are found at the beginning of the [[History of liberal thought|history of liberalism]].

As such, national conservatives can be distinguished from economic conservatives, for whom free market economic policies, [[deregulation]] and fiscal conservatism are the main priorities.

Social conservatives may believe that society is built upon a fragile network of relationships which need to be upheld through duty, traditional values and established institutions;{{sfn|Heywood|2017|p=69}} and that the government has a role in encouraging or enforcing traditional values or behaviours.

The right extremists are conservative, not revolutionary. They seek to change political institutions in order to preserve or restore cultural and economic ones, while extremists of the centre and left seek to use political means for cultural and social revolution. The ideal of the right extremist is not a totalitarian ruler, but a monarch, or a traditionalist who acts like one. Many such movements in Spain,  Austria, Hungary, Germany, and Italy-have been explicitly monarchist....The supporters of these movements differ from those of the centrists, tending to be wealthier, and more religious, which is more important in terms of a potential for mass support.<ref>Seymour M.

Toryism supported a hierarchical society with a monarch who ruled by [[Divine right of kings|divine right]]. [[Tories (British political party)|Tories]] opposed the idea that sovereignty derived from the people and rejected the authority of parliament and freedom of religion. [[Robert Filmer]]'s ''Patriarcha: or the Natural Power of Kings'' (published posthumously in 1680, but written before the [[English Civil War]] of 1642\u20131651) became accepted as the statement of their doctrine. However, the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 destroyed this principle to some degree by establishing a constitutional government in England, leading to the hegemony of the Tory-opposed [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] ideology. Faced with defeat, the Tories reformed their movement, now holding that sovereignty was vested in the three estates of Crown, Lords and Commons<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=ix, 21}}</ref> rather than solely in the Crown.

He supported the [[American Revolution]] of 1765\u20131783, but abhorred the violence of the [[French Revolution]] (1789\u20131799). He accepted the liberal ideals of private property and the economics of [[Adam Smith]] (1723\u20131790), but thought that economics should remain subordinate to the conservative social ethic, that capitalism should be subordinate to the medieval social tradition and that the business class should be subordinate to [[aristocracy]]. He insisted on standards of honor derived from the medieval aristocratic tradition and saw the aristocracy as the nation's natural leaders.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=37\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> That meant limits on the powers of the Crown, since he found the institutions of Parliament to be better informed than commissions appointed by the executive.

Despite their influence on future conservative thought, none of these early contributors were explicitly involved in Tory politics. Hooker lived in the 16th century, long before the advent of [[toryism]], whilst Hume was an apolitical philosopher and Halifax similarly politically independent. Burke described himself as a Whig.\n\n===== Revival =====\nShortly after Burke's death in 1797, conservatism revived as a mainstream political force as the Whigs suffered a series of internal divisions. This new generation of conservatives derived their politics not from Burke but from his predecessor, the [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Viscount Bolingbroke]] (1678\u20131751), who was a Jacobite and traditional Tory, lacking Burke's sympathies for Whiggish policies such as [[Catholic emancipation]] and [[American Revolution|American independence]] (famously attacked by [[Samuel Johnson]] in \"Taxation No Tyranny\"). In the first half of the 19th century, many newspapers, magazines and journals promoted loyalist or right-wing attitudes in religion, politics and international affairs. Burke was seldom mentioned, but [[William Pitt the Younger]] (1759\u20131806) became a conspicuous hero. The most prominent journals included ''The Quarterly Review'', founded in 1809 as a counterweight to the Whigs' ''Edinburgh Review'' and the even more conservative ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine''. Sack finds that the ''Quarterly Review'' promoted a balanced Canningite toryism as it was neutral on Catholic emancipation and only mildly critical of Nonconformist Dissent; it opposed slavery and supported the current poor laws; and it was \"aggressively imperialist\". The [[high-church]] clergy of the Church of England read the ''[[Orthodox Churchman's Magazine]]'' which was equally hostile to Jewish, Catholic, [[Jacobin]], [[Methodist]] and [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] spokesmen. Anchoring the ultra Tories, ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' stood firmly against Catholic emancipation and favoured slavery, cheap money, mercantilism, the [[Navigation Acts]] and the [[Holy Alliance]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sack|first=J.

The effect was to significantly strengthen conservatism as a grassroots political force. Conservatism no longer was the philosophical defense of the landed aristocracy, but had been refreshed into redefining its commitment to the ideals of order, both secular and religious, expanding imperialism, strengthened monarchy and a more generous vision of the welfare state as opposed to the punitive vision of the Whigs and liberals.<ref>Gregory Claeys, \"Political Thought,\" in Chris Williams, ed., ''A Companion to 19th-Century Britain'' (2006). p. 195</ref> As early as 1835, Disraeli attacked the Whigs and utilitarians as slavishly devoted to an industrial oligarchy, while he described his fellow Tories as the only \"really democratic party of England\" and devoted to the interests of the whole people.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Charles Richmond|author2=Paul Smith|title=The Self-Fashioning of Disraeli, 1818\u20131851|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jnF3IRJbKR8C&pg=PA162|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=162|isbn=9780521497299}}</ref> Nevertheless, inside the party there was a tension between the growing numbers of wealthy businessmen on the one side and the aristocracy and rural gentry on the other.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Conservative Illusion|last=Auerbach|first=|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=39\u201340|quote=|via=}}</ref> The aristocracy gained strength as businessmen discovered they could use their wealth to buy a peerage and a country estate.\n\nAlthough conservatives opposed attempts to allow greater representation of the middle class in parliament, they conceded that [[electoral reform]] could not be reversed and promised to support further reforms so long as they did not erode the institutions of church and state. These new principles were presented in the [[Tamworth Manifesto]] of 1834, which historians regard as the basic statement of the beliefs of the new Conservative Party.<ref>{{harvnb|Eccleshall|1990|pp=79\u201380}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Peel Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Robert Peel]] (1788\u20131850)]]\nSome conservatives lamented the passing of a pastoral world where the ethos of ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' had promoted respect from the lower classes.

This marked the beginning of the transformation of British conservatism from [[High Tory]] reactionism towards a more modern form based on \"conservation\". The party became known as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] as a result, a name it has retained to this day. However, Peel would also be the root of a split in the party between the traditional Tories (led by the [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]]) and the \"Peelites\" (led first by Peel himself, then by the [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]]). The split occurred in 1846 over the issue of [[free trade]], which Peel supported, versus [[protectionism]], supported by Derby. The majority of the party sided with Derby whilst about a third split away, eventually merging with the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] and the [[radicalism (politics)|radicals]] to form the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. Despite the split, the mainstream Conservative Party accepted the doctrine of free trade in 1852.\n\nIn the second half of the 19th century, the Liberal Party faced political schisms, especially over [[History of Ireland|Irish]] [[Irish Parliamentary Party|Home Rule]]. Leader [[William Gladstone]] (himself a former Peelite) sought to give Ireland a degree of autonomy, a move that elements in both the left and right-wings of his party opposed. These split off to become the [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]] (led by [[Joseph Chamberlain]]), forming a coalition with the Conservatives before merging with them in 1912. The Liberal Unionist influence dragged the Conservative Party towards the left as Conservative governments passing a number of progressive reforms at the turn of the 20th century. By the late 19th century, the traditional business supporters of the Liberal Party had joined the Conservatives, making them the party of [[business]] and [[commerce]].<ref>{{cite book|title=|last=Feuchtwanger|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=273|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAfter a period of Liberal dominance before the [[First World War]], the Conservatives gradually became more influential in government, regaining full control of the cabinet in 1922. In the interwar period, conservatism was the major ideology in Britain<ref>Stuart Ball, \"Baldwin, Stanley, first Earl Baldwin of Bewdley (1867\u20131947)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' 2004.</ref><ref>Ross McKibbin, ''Parties and people: England, 1914\u20131951'' (Oxford, 2010).</ref><ref>Garside, W.R.; Greaves, J.I.

After the [[Second World War]], the first Labour government (1945\u20131951) under [[Clement Attlee]] embarked on a program of nationalization of industry and the promotion of social welfare.

Bismarck's \"balance of power\" model maintained peace in Europe for decades at the end of the 19th century.

[[Liberty]] within the bounds of conformity to Conservatism is a core value, with a particular emphasis on strengthening the [[free market]], limiting the size and scope of government and opposition to high taxes and government or labor union encroachment on the entrepreneur.\n\nThe major conservative party in the United States is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also known as the GOP (Grand Old Party).

Mostly, this has been achieved through control of and support for civil institutions, the church and the armed forces, rather than through party politics.

They developed in the socio-economic and political cleavages that existed during the first three decades of the 19th century and had the support of the business, professional and established Church (Anglican) elites in Ontario and to a lesser extent in Quebec. Holding a monopoly over administrative and judicial offices, they were called the \"[[Family Compact]]\" in Ontario and the \"[[Chateau Clique]]\" in Quebec. [[John A. Macdonald]]'s successful leadership of the movement to confederate the provinces and his subsequent tenure as prime minister for most of the late 19th century rested on his ability to bring together the English-speaking Protestant oligarchy and the [[ultramontane]] Catholic hierarchy of Quebec and to keep them united in a conservative coalition.<ref>Kornberg, Allan and Mishler, William.

While the term \"liberal\" had been used to describe all political forces in Colombia, the conservatives began describing themselves as \"conservative liberals\" and their opponents as \"red liberals\". From the 1860s until the present, the party has supported strong central government; supported the Catholic Church, especially its role as protector of the sanctity of the family; and opposed separation of church and state. Its policies include the legal equality of all men, the citizen's right to own property and opposition to dictatorship. It has usually been Colombia's second largest party, with the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] being the largest.<ref>Osterling, p. 180</ref>\n\n==== Denmark ====\nFounded in 1915, the [[Conservative People's Party (Denmark)|Conservative People's Party of Denmark]]. was the successor of ''H\u00f8jre'' (literally \"[[Right-wing politics|Right\"]]).

The party suffered a major defeat in the parliamentary elections of September 2011 in which the party lost more than half of its seat and also lost governmental power. A liberal cultural policy dominated during the postwar period.

The party was founded in 1918 when several monarchist parties united. Although in the past the party was right-wing, today it is a moderate liberal conservative party. While the party advocates [[economic liberalism]], it is committed to the [[social market economy]].<ref>Siaroff, Alan.

Both it and the Liberal party were suppressed by the authoritarian, arch-conservative and royalist [[4th of August Regime]] of [[Ioannis Metaxas]] in 1936\u20131941. The PP was able to re-group after the Second World War as part of a United Nationalist Front which achieved power campaigning on a simple anticommunist, ultranationalist platform during the [[Greek Civil War]] (1946\u20131949). However, the vote received by the PP declined during the so-called \"Centrist Interlude\" in 1950\u20131952. In 1952, Marshal [[Alexandros Papagos]] created the [[Greek Rally]] as an umbrella for the right-wing forces. The Greek Rally came to power in 1952 and remained the leading party in Greece until 1963\u2014after Papagos' death in 1955 reformed as the [[National Radical Union]] under [[Konstantinos Karamanlis]]. Right-wing governments backed by the palace and the army overthrew the [[Centre Union]] government in 1965 and governed the country until the establishment of the far-right [[Regime of the Colonels]] (1967\u20131974). After the [[metapolitefsi|regime's collapse]] in August 1974, Karamanlis returned from exile to lead the government and founded the [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]] party. The new conservative party had four objectives: to confront [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|Turkish expansionism in Cyprus]], to reestablish and solidify democratic rule, to give the country a strong government and to make a powerful moderate party a force in Greek politics.<ref>Penniman, Howard Rae.

From the beginning, they have been the largest vote-winning party, averaging around 40%. They combined liberalism and conservatism, supported nationalization of infrastructure and opposed class conflict. While mostly in opposition during the 1930s, they embraced [[economic liberalism]], but accepted the welfare state after the war and participated in governments supportive of state intervention and protectionism. Unlike other Scandanivian conservative (and liberal) parties, it has always had a large working-class following.<ref>Grofman, Bernard and Lijpart, Arend, editors.

Officially, DC refused the ideology of conservatism, but in many aspects, for example [[family values]], it was a typical [[social conservative]] party.\n\nIn 1994, the media tycoon and entrepreneur [[Silvio Berlusconi]] founded the [[liberal conservative]] party [[Forza Italia]] (FI). Berlusconi won three elections in [[Italian general election, 1994|1994]], [[Italian general election, 2001|2001]] and [[Italian general election, 2008|2008]], governing the country for almost ten years as [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]].

Alfano was the current [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]].

It formed its first government under parliamentarism in 1889 and continued to alternate in power with the Liberals until the 1930s, when Labour became the dominant political party.

The SVP emphasized agricultural policy and was strong among farmers in German-speaking Protestant areas. As Switzerland considered closer relations with the European Union in the 1990s, the SVP adopted a more militant protectionist and isolationist stance.

Putin has attacked globalism and economic liberalism. Putin has promoted new think tanks that bring together like-minded intellectuals and writers. For example, the Izborsky Club, founded in 2012 by Aleksandr Prokhanov, stresses Russian nationalism, the restoration of Russia's historical greatness and systematic opposition to liberal ideas and policies.<ref>Marlene Laruelle, \"The Izborsky Club, or the New Conservative Avant\u2010Garde in Russia.\" ''Russian Review'' 75.4 (2016): 626\u201344.</ref> [[Vladislav Surkov]], a senior government official, has been one of the key ideologists during Putin's presidency.<ref>Sirke M\u00e4kinen,  \"Surkovian narrative on the future of Russia: making Russia a world leader.\" ''Journal of Communist Studies and Transition Politics'' 27#2 (2011): 143\u201365.</ref>\n\nIn cultural and social affairs, Putin has collaborated closely with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].

First it was the Democratic-Republican Party (1963\u20131980) and its head was [[Park Chung-hee]], who seized power in a 1961 military coup d'\u00e9tat and ruled as an unelected military strongman until his formal election as President in [[South Korean presidential election, 1963|1963]]. He was President for 16 years until his assassination on 26 October 1979. The [[Democratic Justice Party]] inherited the same ideology as the Democratic-Republican Party. Its head, [[Chun Doo-hwan]], also gained power through a coup and his followers called themselves the Hanahae. The Democratic Justice Party changed its form and acted to suppress the opposition party and to follow the people's demand for direct elections. The party's [[Roh Tae-woo]] became the first President who was elected through direct election. The next form of the major conservative party was the Democratic-Liberal Party and again through election its second leader, [[Kim Young-sam]], became the fourteenth President of Korea. When the conservative party was beaten by the opposition party in the general election, it changed its form again to follow the party members' demand for reforms. It became the New Korean Party, but it changed again one year later since the President Kim Young-sam was blamed by the citizen for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{clarify|date=March 2014}} It changed its name to Grand National Party (GNP).

The early studies focused on conservatives, beginning with [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950) based on the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]] personality test. This book has been heavily criticized on theoretical and methodological grounds, but some of its findings have been confirmed by further empirical research.<ref name=\"Jost, J.J 2003\">Jost, J.J, Glaser, J., Kruglanski, A.A., & Sulloway, F.J.

(Ed.)(1973) The Psychology of Conservatism, London: Academic Press.</ref> A meta-analysis of research literature by Jost, Glaser, Kruglanski and Sulloway in 2003 found that many factors, such as [[Ambiguity tolerance|intolerance of ambiguity]] and need for [[Cognitive closure (psychology)|cognitive closure]], contribute to the degree of one's political conservatism.<ref name=\"Jost, J.J 2003\"/> A study by Kathleen Maclay stated these traits \"might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty\". The research also suggested that while most people are resistant to change, liberals are more tolerant of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2003/07/22_politics.shtml|title=Researchers help define what makes a political conservative|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nAccording to psychologist [[Bob Altemeyer]], individuals who are politically conservative tend to rank high in [[right-wing authoritarianism]] (RWA) on his RWA scale.<ref>Altemeyer, B.

Classical liberals believe that individuals are \"egoistic, coldly calculating, essentially inert and atomistic\"{{sfn|Hunt|p=44}} and that society is no more than the sum of its individual members.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=44\u201346}}\n\nClassical liberals agreed with [[Thomas Hobbes]] that government had been created by individuals to protect themselves from each other and that the purpose of government should be to minimize conflict between individuals that would otherwise arise in a [[state of nature]]. These beliefs were complemented by a belief that laborers could be best motivated by financial incentive. This belief led to the passage of the [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]], which limited the provision of social assistance, based on the idea that [[Market (economics)|markets]] are the mechanism that most efficiently leads to wealth. Adopting [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]'s population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nDrawing on ideas of [[Adam Smith]], classical liberals believed that it is in the common interest that all individuals be able to secure their own economic self-interest. They were critical of what would come to be the idea of the [[welfare state]] as interfering in a [[free market]].<ref name=\"Ryan\">Alan Ryan, \"Liberalism\", in ''A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy'', ed.

In a free market, both labor and capital would receive the greatest possible reward while production would be organized efficiently to meet consumer demand.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nClassical liberals argued for what they called a minimal state, limited to the following functions:\n* A government to protect individual rights and to provide services that cannot be provided in a free market.\n* A common national defense to provide protection against foreign invaders.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51\u201353}}\n* Laws to provide protection for citizens from wrongs committed against them by other citizens, which included protection of private property, enforcement of contracts and common law.\n* Building and maintaining public institutions.\n* Public works that included a stable currency, standard weights and measures and building and upkeep of roads, canals, harbors, railways, communications and postal services.{{sfn|Hunt|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nThey asserted that rights are of a [[Negative and positive rights|negative]] nature, which require other individuals (and governments) to refrain from interfering with the free market, opposing social liberals who assert that individuals have positive rights, such as the right to vote, the right to an education, the right to health care and the right to a living wage. For society to guarantee positive rights, it requires taxation over and above the minimum needed to enforce negative rights.<ref name=Cato_Institut_Kelley>[[David Kelley|Kelly, D.]] (1998): ''A Life of One's Own: Individual Rights and the Welfare State'', Washington, DC: [[Cato Institute]].</ref>{{sfn|Richardson|pp=36\u201338}}\n\nCore beliefs of classical liberals did not necessarily include [[democracy]] or government by a majority vote by citizens because \"there is nothing in the bare idea of majority rule to show that majorities will always respect the rights of property or maintain rule of law\".<ref name=\"RyanA_1995\">Ryan, A.

Hayek saw the British philosophers [[Bernard Mandeville]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], [[Adam Ferguson]], [[Josiah Tucker]] and [[William Paley]] as representative of a tradition that articulated beliefs in [[empiricism]], the [[common law]] and in traditions and institutions which had spontaneously evolved but were imperfectly understood. The French tradition included [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Marquis de Condorcet]], the [[Encyclop\u00e9distes|Encyclopedists]] and the [[Physiocrats]]. This tradition believed in rationalism and sometimes showed hostility to tradition and religion. Hayek conceded that the national labels did not exactly correspond to those belonging to each tradition: Hayek saw the Frenchmen [[Montesquieu]], [[Benjamin Constant]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] as belonging to the \"British tradition\" and the British [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Joseph Priestley]], [[Richard Price]] and [[Thomas Paine]] as belonging to the \"French tradition\".<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite book|first = F.

This liberalism had  \"insensibly adapted ancient institutions to modern needs\" and \"instinctively recoiled from all abstract proclamations of principles and rights\".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|p=81}} Ruggiero claimed that this liberalism was challenged by what he called the \"new Liberalism of France\" that was characterised by egalitarianism and a \"rationalistic consciousness\".{{sfn|De Ruggiero|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nIn 1848, [[Francis Lieber]] distinguished between what he called \"Anglican and Gallican Liberty\". Lieber asserted that \"independence in the highest degree, compatible with safety and broad national guarantees of liberty, is the great aim of Anglican liberty, and self-reliance is the chief source from which it draws its strength\".{{sfn|Lieber|p=377}} On the other hand, Gallican liberty \"is sought in government...the French look for the highest degree of political civilization in organizational, that is, in the highest degree of interference by public power\".{{sfn|Lieber|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n== History ==\n=== Great Britain ===\nClassical liberalism in Britain developed from [[Whigs (British political party)|Whiggery]] and [[Radicalism (historical)|radicalism]], was also heavily influenced by French [[physiocracy]] and represented a new political ideology. Whiggery had become a dominant ideology following the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 and was associated with the defence of the British Parliament, upholding the rule of law and defending [[landed property]]. The origins of rights were seen as being in an [[ancient constitution]], which had existed from [[time immemorial]]. These rights, which some Whigs considered to include freedom of the press and freedom of speech, were justified by custom rather than by [[natural rights]]. They believed that the power of the executive had to be constrained. While they supported limited suffrage, they saw voting as a privilege rather than as a right. However, there was no consistency in Whig ideology and diverse writers including [[John Locke]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]] and [[Edmund Burke]] were all influential among Whigs, although none of them was universally accepted.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}}\n\nFrom the 1790s to the 1820s, British radicals concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasising natural rights and popular sovereignty. [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] adapted the language of Locke to the ideology of radicalism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=28-29}} The radicals saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.<ref>{{cite book| first=Michael J. |last=Turner |year=1999 |title=British Politics in an Age of Reform |location=Manchester, England |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-51869 |page=86}}</ref>\n\nThere was greater unity to classical liberalism ideology than there had been with Whiggery. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. They believed that required a free economy with minimal government interference. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, which they saw as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers. Some elements of Whiggery opposed this new thinking and were uncomfortable with the commercial nature of classical liberalism. These elements became associated with conservatism.{{sfn|Vincent|pp=29\u201330}}\n\n[[File:1846 - Anti-Corn Law League Meeting.jpg|thumb|250px|A meeting of the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] in [[Exeter Hall]] in 1846]]\nClassical liberalism was the dominant political theory in Britain from the early 19th century until the First World War. Its notable victories were the [[Catholic Relief Act 1829|Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829]], the [[Reform Act of 1832]] and the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846. The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure. Their policies of low public expenditure and low taxation were adopted by [[William Ewart Gladstone]] when he became [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] and later [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]]. Classical liberalism was often associated with religious dissent and [[nonconformism]].{{sfn|Gray|pp=26\u201327}}\n\nAlthough classical liberals aspired to a minimum of state activity, they accepted the principle of [[government intervention]] in the economy from the early 19th century with passage of the [[Factory Acts]]. From around 1840 to 1860, ''laissez-faire'' advocates of the [[Manchester capitalism|Manchester School]] and writers in ''[[The Economist]]'' were confident that their early victories would lead to a period of expanding economic and personal liberty and world peace, but would face reversals as government intervention and activity continued to expand from the 1850s. [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of ''laissez-faire'', non-intervention in foreign affairs and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[utilitarianism]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] rejected classical liberalism altogether and advocated [[Tory democracy]]. By the 1870s, [[Herbert Spencer]] and other classical liberals concluded that historical development was turning against them.{{sfn|Gray|p=28}} By the First World War, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] had largely abandoned classical liberal principles.{{sfn|Gray|p=32}}\n\nThe changing economic and social conditions of the 19th century led to a division between neo-classical and social (or welfare) liberals, who while agreeing on the importance of individual liberty differed on the role of the state.  Neo-classical liberals, who called themselves \"true liberals\", saw Locke's ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise]]'' as the best guide and emphasised \"limited government\" while social liberals supported government regulation and the welfare state. Herbert Spencer in Britain and [[William Graham Sumner]] were the leading neo-classical liberal theorists of the 19th century.{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=596}} Neo-classical liberalism has continued into the contemporary era, with writers such as [[John Rawls]].{{sfn|Ishiyama|Breuning|p=603}} The evolution from classical to social/welfare liberalism is for example reflected in Britain in the evolution of the thought of [[John Maynard Keynes]].<ref>See the studies of Keynes by [[Roy Harrod]], [[Robert Skidelsky]], [[Donald Moggridge]] and [[Donald Markwell]].</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the United States, liberalism took a strong root because it had little opposition to its ideals, whereas in Europe liberalism was opposed by many reactionary or feudal interests such as the nobility, the aristocracy, the landed gentry, the established church and the aristocratic army officers.<ref>{{cite book|first =Louis|last= Hartz|title=The Liberal Tradition in America|date=1955|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=e1bQY1CDx2IC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA3#v=onepage&q&f=false |chapter = The Concept of a Liberal Society|isbn = 9780156512695|publisher = Houghton Mifflin Harcourt}}</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] adopted many of the ideals of liberalism, but in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] changed Locke's \"life, liberty and property\" to the more [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]] \"[[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness]]\".<ref name=\"Steven M.

Although these writings were considered too radical at the time for Britain's new rulers, they later came to be cited by Whigs, radicals and supporters of the [[American Revolution]].<ref>Steven M. Dworetz, ''The Unvarnished Doctrine: Locke, Liberalism, and the American Revolution'' (1989).</ref> However, much of later liberal thought was absent in Locke's writings or scarcely mentioned and his writings have been subject to various interpretations. For example, there is little mention of [[constitutionalism]], the [[separation of powers]] and [[limited government]].{{sfn|Richardson|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nJames L. Richardson identified five central themes in Locke's writing: [[individualism]], consent, the concepts of the [[rule of law]] and government as trustee, the significance of property and religious toleration. Although Locke did not develop a theory of natural rights, he envisioned individuals in the state of nature as being free and equal. The individual, rather than the community or institutions, was the point of reference. Locke believed that individuals had given consent to government and therefore authority derived from the people rather than from above. This belief would influence later revolutionary movements.{{sfn|Richardson|p=23}}\n\nAs a trustee, government was expected to serve the interests of the people, not the rulers; and rulers were expected to follow the laws enacted by legislatures. Locke also held that the main purpose of men uniting into commonwealths and governments was for the preservation of their property. Despite the ambiguity of Locke's definition of property, which limited property to \"as much land as a man tills, plants, improves, cultivates, and can use the product of\", this principle held great appeal to individuals possessed of great wealth.{{sfn|Richardson|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nLocke held that the individual had the right to follow his own religious beliefs and that the state should not impose a religion against [[Dissenter]]s, but there were limitations. No tolerance should be shown for [[Atheism|atheists]], who were seen as amoral, or to [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], who were seen as owing allegiance to the Pope over their own national government.{{sfn|Richardson|p=24}}\n\n=== Adam Smith ===\n[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|160px|[[Adam Smith]]]]\n[[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' in 1848.{{sfn|Mills|pp=63, 68}} Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth and the policies the state should follow to maximise wealth.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}\n\nSmith wrote that as long as supply, demand, prices and competition were left free of government regulation, the pursuit of material self-interest, rather than altruism, would maximise the wealth of a society<ref name = smith/> through profit-driven production of goods and services. An \"[[invisible hand]]\" directed individuals and firms to work toward the public good as an unintended consequence of efforts to maximise their own gain. This provided a moral justification for the accumulation of wealth, which had previously been viewed by some as sinful.{{sfn|Mills|p=64}}\n\nHe assumed that workers could be paid wages as low as was necessary for their survival, which was later transformed by [[David Ricardo]] and [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] into the \"[[iron law of wages]]\".{{sfn|Mills|p=65}} His main emphasis was on the benefit of free internal and international trade, which he thought could increase wealth through specialisation in production.{{sfn|Mills|p=66}} He also opposed restrictive trade preferences, state grants of monopolies and employers' organisations and trade unions.{{sfn|Mills|p=67}} Government should be limited to defence, public works and the administration of justice, financed by taxes based on income.{{sfn|Mills|p=68}}\n\nSmith's economics was carried into practice in the nineteenth century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}}\n\n=== Classical economics ===\nIn addition to Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], [[Thomas Robert Malthus]]' theories of population and [[David Ricardo]]'s [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of [[classical economics]]. The pessimistic nature of these theories provided a basis for criticism of capitalism by its opponents and helped perpetuate the tradition of calling economics the \"[[dismal science]]\".{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Say]] was a French economist who introduced Smith's economic theories into France and whose commentaries on Smith were read in both France and Britain.{{sfn|Mills|p=69}} Say challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. His most important contribution to economic thinking was Say's law, which was interpreted by classical economists that there could be no overproduction in a market and that there would always be a balance between supply and demand.{{sfn|Mills|p=70}} This general belief influenced government policies until the 1930s. Following this law, since the economic cycle was seen as self-correcting, government did not intervene during periods of economic hardship because it was seen as futile.{{sfn|Mills|p=71}}\n\nMalthus wrote two books, ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' (published in 1798) and ''[[Principles of Political Economy (Malthus)|Principles of Political Economy]]'' (published in 1820). The second book which was a rebuttal of Say's law had little influence on contemporary economists.{{sfn|Mills|pp=71\u201372}} However, his first book became a major influence on classical liberalism. In that book, Malthus claimed that population growth would outstrip food production because population grew geometrically while food production grew arithmetically. As people were provided with food, they would reproduce until their growth outstripped the food supply. Nature would then provide a check to growth in the forms of vice and misery. No gains in income could prevent this and any welfare for the poor would be self-defeating. The poor were in fact responsible for their own problems which could have been avoided through self-restraint.{{sfn|Mills|p=72}}\n\nRicardo, who was an admirer of Smith, covered many of the same topics, but while Smith drew conclusions from broadly empirical observations he used deduction, drawing conclusions by reasoning from basic assumptions {{sfn|Mills|pp=73\u201374}} While Ricardo accepted Smith's [[labour theory of value]], he acknowledged that utility could influence the price of some rare items. Rents on agricultural land were seen as the production that was surplus to the subsistence required by the tenants. Wages were seen as the amount required for workers' subsistence and to maintain current population levels.{{sfn|Mills|pp=74\u201375}} According to his iron law of wages, wages could never rise beyond subsistence levels. Ricardo explained profits as a return on capital, which itself was the product of labour, but a conclusion many drew from his theory was that profit was a surplus appropriated by [[Capitalism|capitalists]] to which they were not entitled.{{sfn|Mills|p=75}}\n\n=== Utilitarianism ===\n[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments, which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and [[John Stuart Mill]]'s later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.{{sfn|Richardson|p=32}}\n\nThe central concept of utilitarianism, which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]], was that public policy should seek to provide \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.{{sfn|Mills|p=76}}\n\n== Political economy ==\nClassical liberals saw utility as the foundation for public policies. This broke both with conservative \"[[Traditionalist conservatism|tradition]]\" and [[Natural rights#John Locke|Lockean \"natural rights\"]], which were seen as irrational. Utility, which emphasises the happiness of individuals, became the central ethical value of all liberalism.{{sfn|Richardson|p=31}} Although utilitarianism inspired wide-ranging reforms, it became primarily a justification for ''laissez-faire'' economics. However, classical liberals rejected Smith's belief that the \"invisible hand\" would lead to general benefits and embraced Malthus' view that population expansion would prevent any general benefit and Ricardo's view of the inevitability of class conflict. ''Laissez-faire'' was seen as the only possible economic approach and any government intervention was seen as useless and harmful. The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834]] was defended on \"scientific or economic principles\" while the authors of the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601|Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601]] were seen as not having had the benefit of reading Malthus.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}\n\nHowever, commitment to ''laissez-faire'' was not uniform and some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]] as Ricardo expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs advocated by [[Richard Cobden]] and the [[Anti-Corn Law League]] would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}}\n\nDespite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].{{sfn|Richardson|p=33}} The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''The Economist'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}}\n\n''The Economist'' also campaigned against the Corn Laws that protected landlords in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland against competition from less expensive foreign imports of cereal products. A rigid belief in ''laissez-faire'' guided the government response in 1846\u20131849 to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in Ireland, during which an estimated 1.5 million people died. The minister responsible for economic and financial affairs, [[Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax|Charles Wood]], expected that private enterprise and free trade, rather than government intervention, would alleviate the famine.{{sfn|Richardson|p=34}} The [[Corn Laws]] were finally repealed in 1846 by the removal of tariffs on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high,<ref>George Miller.

To Cobden and many classical liberals, those who advocated peace must also advocate free markets. The belief that free trade would promote peace was widely shared by English liberals of the 19th and early 20th century, leading the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883\u20131946), who was a classical liberal in his early life, to say that this was a doctrine on which he was \"brought up\" and which he held unquestioned only until the 1920s.<ref>[[Donald Markwell]], [http://global.oup.com/academic/product/john-maynard-keynes-and-international-relations-9780198292364;jsessionid=4B0FEAE67C6CC2944F0147AFD5045F62?cc=au&lang=en& ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace''], Oxford University Press, 2006, ch. 1.</ref> In his review of a book on Keynes, Michael S.

The people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 [[Louis XIV]], crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At [[Metz]] midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in [[wicker]] cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]], in the [[Departments of France|department]] of the [[Hautes-Alpes]], cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.\"<ref>[[James Frazer|Frazer, Sir James George]].

Rodents, for example, are a branch of [[mammal]]s that split off after the end of the period when the clade [[Dinosaur]]ia stopped being the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s 66 million years ago. The original population and all its descendants are a clade. The rodent clade corresponds to the order Rodentia, and insects to the class Insecta. These clades include smaller clades, such as [[chipmunk]] or [[ant]], each of which consists of even smaller clades. The clade \"rodent\" is in turn included in the mammal, [[vertebrate]] and animal clades.\n\n== History of nomenclature and taxonomy ==\n[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|right|Early phylogenetic tree by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1866. Groups once thought to be more advanced, such as birds (\"Aves\"), are placed at the top.]]\n\nThe idea of a clade did not exist in pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[Linnaean taxonomy]], which was based by necessity only on internal or external [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between organisms \u2013 although as it happens, many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original [[Systema Naturae]] (notably among the [[vertebrate]] groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of [[convergent evolution]] is, however, responsible for many cases where there are misleading similarities in the morphology of groups that evolved from different lineages.\n\nWith the increasing realization in the first half of the 19th century that species had changed and split through the ages, classification increasingly came to be seen as branches on the evolutionary [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. The publication of Darwin's [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in 1859 gave this view increasing weight. [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an early advocate of evolutionary theory, proposed a revised taxonomy based on clades.<ref name=\"original text w/ figures\">Huxley, T.H. (1876): Lectures on Evolution.

In the latter, only taxa associated with a [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] can be named, yet there are not enough ranks to name a long series of nested clades; also, taxon names cannot be defined in a way that guarantees them to refer to clades. For these and other reasons, [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has been developed; it is still controversial.\n\n==Definitions==\n[[File:Cladogram Crocodilia NL.PNG|thumb|right|Gavialidae, Crocodylidae and Alligatoridae are clade names that are here applied to a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] tree of crocodylians.]]\n\nA clade is by definition [[monophyletic]], meaning that it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a population, or a species) and all its descendants.<ref group=note>\nA semantic case has been made that the name should be \"holophyletic\", but this term has not acquired widespread use.

The third GSM license was awarded to Areeba in September 2005 for a period of 15 years, and a total license fee of $40.1 million. Areeba was a subsidiary of the Lebanon-based firm Investcom in consortium with Alokozai-FZE. After commencing services in July 2006, Areeba had an estimated subscribership of 200,000 by the end of that year. Areeba was later acquired by the South African-based Mobile Telephone Network (MTN) in mid-2007 as part of a $5.53 billion global merger between the two companies. MTN-Afghanistan is a subsidiary of the South African-based MTN Group, a multinational telecommunications company operating across the Middle East and Africa. MTN is the majority (90%) shareholder, while International Finance Corporation (IFC) at 9% is also a debt and equity shareholder of MTN-Afghanistan. MTN operates at 900-1800 MHZ GSM band, and as of 2012 has 4.5 million subscribers and service coverage in most major cities, 464 districts, and all 34 provincial capitals. With over $400 million in total investment, MTN offers mobile voice, SMS, MMS, SRS, GPRS, fax, voicemail and PCO services through prepaid, postpaid and corporate tariffs.\n\nMTN has interconnection agreements with all national telecom operators and provides international voice and SMS roaming in 121 countries and across 227 operators through prepaid and postpaid roaming tariffs. MTN also has a national ISP license which the company received in November 2008. MTN was the first company to introduce the popular per-second billing system in the country (also known as \u201cpay as you talk\u201d) allowing its subscribers to transparently track their talk-time and receive billing summaries via SMS. The scheme was so popular that other GSM companies quickly adopted this method.\n\n==Internet==\n{{Main article|Internet in Afghanistan}}\n[[File:Afghan man reading Wikipedia article in Kandahar.jpg|thumb|Internet user at [[Kandahar University]]]]\nAfghanistan was given legal control of the \"[[.af]]\" domain in 2003, and the Afghanistan Network Information Center (AFGNIC) was established to administer [[domain name]]s.

Probably as a juvenile he joined the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] Order at newly established [[Ko\u0142bacz]] (''Kolbatz'') Abbey and in 1209 entered [[Oliwa]] Abbey near [[Gda\u0144sk]], founded in 1178 by the [[Samborides|Samboride]] dukes of [[Pomerelia]]. At this time the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]] duke [[Konrad I of Masovia]] with the consent of [[Pope Innocent III]] had started the first of several unsuccessful [[Prussian Crusade]]s into the adjacent [[Che\u0142mno Land]] and Christian acted as a missionary among the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] east of the [[Vistula]] River.\n\n[[File:Prussian clans 13th century.png|thumb|left|Prussian tribes in the 13th century, Che\u0142mno Land (''Kulmerland'') in white]]\nIn 1209, Christian was commissioned by the Pope to be responsible for the Prussian missions between the Vistula and [[Neman River|Neman]] Rivers and in 1212 he was appointed bishop. In 1215 he went to [[Rome]] in order to report to the [[Roman Curia|Curia]] on the condition and prospects of his mission, and was consecrated first \"Bishop of Prussia\" at the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]]. His seat as a bishop remained at Oliwa Abbey on the western side of the Vistula, whereas the pagan Prussian (later [[East Prussia]]n) territory was on the eastern side of it.\n\nThe attempts by Konrad of Masovia to subdue the Prussian lands had picked long-term and intense border quarrels, whereby the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Polish]] lands of [[Duchy of Masovia|Masovia]], [[Kujawy|Cuyavia]] and even Greater Poland became subject to continuous Prussian raids. Bishop Christian asked the new [[Pope Honorius III]] for the consent to start another Crusade, however a first campaign in 1217 proved a failure and even the joint efforts by Duke Konrad with the Polish High Duke [[Leszek I the White]] and Duke [[Henry I the Bearded]] of Silesia in 122/23 only led to the reconquest of Che\u0142mno Land but did not stop the Prussian invasions. At least Christian was able to establish the [[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Diocese of Che\u0142mno]] east of the Vistula, adopting the episcopal rights from the Masovian [[Roman Catholic Diocese of P\u0142ock|Bishop of P\u0142ock]], confirmed by both Duke Konrad and the Pope.\n\nDuke Konrad of Masovia still was not capable to end the Prussian attacks on his territory and in 1224 began to conduct negotiations with the [[Teutonic Knights]] under Grand Master [[Hermann von Salza]] in order to strengthen his forces. As von Salza initially hesitated to offer his services, Christian created the military [[Order of Dobrzy\u0144]] (''Fratres Milites Christi'') in 1228, however to little avail.\n\nMeanwhile, von Salza had to abandon his hope to establish an Order's State in the [[Burzenland]] region of [[Transylvania]], which had led to an \u00e9clat with King [[Andrew II of Hungary]]. He obtained a charter by Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] issued in the 1226 [[Golden Bull of Rimini]], whereby Che\u0142mno Land would be the unshared possession of the Teutonic Knights, which was confirmed by Duke Konrad of Masovia in the 1230 Treaty of Kruszwica. Christian ceded his possessions to the new [[State of the Teutonic Order]] and in turn was appointed Bishop of Che\u0142mno the next year.\n\nBishop Christian continued his mission in [[Sambia Peninsula|Sambia]] (''Samland''), where from 1233 to 1239 he was held captive by pagan Prussians, and freed in trade for five other hostages who then in turn were released for a ransom of 800 [[mark (money)|Marks]], granted to him by [[Pope Gregory IX]]. He had to deal with the constant cut-back of his autonomy by the Knights and asked the Roman Curia for mediation. In 1243, the Papal legate [[William of Modena]] divided the Prussian lands of the Order's State into four dioceses, whereby the bishops retained the secular rule over about on third of the diocesan territory:\n*[[Bishopric of Culm (Che\u0142mno)|Bishopric of Che\u0142mno]] ([[Che\u0142mno Land]], Ziemia Che\u0142minska)\n*[[Bishopric of Pomesania]] ([[Pomesania]])\n*[[Prince-Bishopric of Warmia|Bishopric of Warmia (Ermland)]] (state)/ [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Warmia|Diocese of Warmia]] (ecclesiastical ambit)\n*[[Bishopric of Samland]] (Sambia)\nall [[suffragan diocese]]s under the [[Archbishopric of Riga]]. Christian was supposed to choose one of them, but did not agree to the division. He possibly retired to the [[Cistercians Abbey in Sulej\u00f3w]], where he died before the conflict was solved.\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03704a.htm Article in Catholic Encyclopedia at newadvent.org]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:German Cistercians]]\n[[Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops]]\n[[Category:1245 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Prussia]]\n[[Category:Christians of the Prussian Crusade]]\n[[Category:Year of birth unknown]]", "sha1": "kxr3fe9intmz23j8tg8eo3xv9zcgqf1"}}, {"title": "Coca-Cola", "ns": "0", "id": "6690", "revision": {"id": "864273085", "parentid": "862555122", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T06:28:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kahtar", "id": "19297870"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Repair CS1 error(s), replaced: website=www. \u2192 website=", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the beverage|its manufacturer|The Coca-Cola Company}}\n{{Redirect|Coca-Cola Classic|the college football game|Coca-Cola Classic (college football)}}\n{{Pp-semi-protected|small=yes}}\n{{Pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2018}}\n{{Infobox beverage\n|name = Coca-Cola\n|image = Coca-Cola logo.svg\n|caption =\n|type = [[Cola]]\n|manufacturer = [[The Coca-Cola Company]]\n|origin = United States\n|headquarters = 1 Coca-Cola Plaza [[Atlanta, Georgia]] 30313\n|introduced = {{start date and age|1886|5|8}}\n|color = [[Caramel color|Caramel E-150d]]\n|variants = {{plainlist|\n*[[Diet Coke]]\n*[[Diet Coke Caffeine-Free]]\n*[[Caffeine-Free Coca-Cola]]\n*[[Coca-Cola Zero Sugar]]\n*[[Coca-Cola Cherry]]\n*[[Coca-Cola Vanilla]]\n*[[Coca-Cola Citra]]\n*[[Coca-Cola Life]]\n}}\n|related = [[Pepsi]]<br />[[RC Cola]]<br />[[Afri-Cola]]<br />[[Postob\u00f3n]]<br />[[Inca Kola]]<br />[[Kola Real]]<br />[[Cavan Cola]]\n|website = {{URL|coca-cola.com/}}\n}}\n[[File:Flasche Coca-Cola 0,2 Liter.jpg|thumb|Coca-Cola bottle]]\n\n'''Coca-Cola''', or '''Coke''' is a [[Carbonation|carbonated]] [[soft drink]]<ref>In June 2012, Coca-Cola announced its intentions to begin distributing in [[Myanmar]]. {{cite news|title=Coca-Cola to spend $30 billion to grow globally|first=Leon|last=Stafford|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/business/coca-cola-to-spend-30-billion-to-grow-globally/nR6YS/|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=September 9, 2012|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> manufactured by [[The Coca-Cola Company]].

When Candler had the earliest records of the \"Coca-Cola Company\" burned in 1910, the action was claimed to have been made during a move to new corporation offices around this time.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 49  }}</ref>\n\nAfter Candler had gained a better foothold on Coca-Cola in April 1888, he nevertheless was forced to sell the beverage he produced with the recipe he had under the names \"Yum Yum\" and \"Koke\". This was while Charley Pemberton was selling the elixir, although a cruder mixture, under the name \"Coca-Cola\", all with his father's blessing. After both names failed to catch on for Candler, by the middle of 1888, the Atlanta pharmacist was quite anxious to establish a firmer legal claim to Coca-Cola, and hoped he could force his two competitors, Walker and Dozier, completely out of the business, as well.<ref name=\"ForGodCountryandCocaColapg44-45\" />\n\nOn August 16, 1888, Dr. John Stith Pemberton suddenly died; Asa G. Candler then sought to move swiftly forward to attain his vision of taking full control of the whole Coca-Cola operation.\n\nCharley Pemberton, an alcoholic, was the one obstacle who unnerved Asa Candler more than anyone else. Candler is said to have quickly maneuvered to purchase the exclusive rights to the name \"Coca-Cola\" from Pemberton's son Charley right after Dr. Pemberton's death. One of several stories was that Candler bought the title to the name from Charley's mother for $300; approaching her at Dr. Pemberton's funeral. Eventually, Charley Pemberton was found on June 23, 1894, unconscious, with a stick of opium by his side. Ten days later, Charley died at Atlanta's Grady Hospital at the age of 40.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| pages = 48&nbsp;\u201349}}</ref>\n\nIn Charles Howard Candler's 1950 book about his father, he stated: \"On August 30th [1888], he [Asa Candler] became sole proprietor of Coca-Cola, a fact which was stated on letterheads, invoice blanks and advertising copy.\"<ref>{{cite book | author = Candler, Charles Howard | title = Asa Griggs Candler | year = 1950 | publisher = Emory University | page = 81 | location = Georgia}}</ref>\n\nWith this action on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became technically all true. Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier and her brother Woolfolk Walker a full payment amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off with a series of notes over a specified time span. By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.<ref>{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| title = For God, Country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8| page = 46 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Margaret Dozier, as co-owner of the original Coca-Cola Company in 1888, came forward to claim that her signature on the 1888 Coca-Cola Company bill of sale had been forged.

Root, president of [[the Root Glass Company]] of [[Terre Haute, Indiana]], turned the project over to members of his supervisory staff, including company auditor T. Clyde Edwards, plant superintendent Alexander Samuelsson, and [[Earl R. Dean]], bottle designer and supervisor of the bottle molding room. Root and his subordinates decided to base the bottle's design on one of the soda's two ingredients, the [[coca leaf]] or the [[kola nut]], but were unaware of what either ingredient looked like. Dean and Edwards went to the [[Emeline Fairbanks Memorial Library]] and were unable to find any information about coca or kola. Instead, Dean was inspired by a picture of the gourd-shaped [[cocoa pod]] in the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]. Dean made a rough sketch of the pod and returned to the plant to show Root. He explained to Root how he could transform the shape of the pod into a bottle. Root gave Dean his approval.<ref name=\"vigo.lib.in.us\" />\n\nFaced with the upcoming scheduled maintenance of the mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small number of bottles before the glass-molding machinery was turned off.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Bottle |last=Lundy |first=Betty |year=1986 |publisher=American Heritage Inc. |issn=0002-8738 |pages=98\u2013101 |url=http://contourbottle.angelfire.com/The_Bottle.pdf |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nChapman Root approved the prototype bottle and a [[design patent]] was issued on the bottle in November 1915. The prototype never made it to production since its middle diameter was larger than its base, making it unstable on [[conveyor belt]]s. Dean resolved this issue by decreasing the bottle's middle diameter. During the 1916 bottler's convention, Dean's contour bottle was chosen over other entries and was on the market the same year. By 1920, the contour bottle became the standard for The Coca-Cola Company. A revised version was also patented in 1923. Because the Patent Office releases the ''Patent Gazette'' on Tuesday, the bottle was patented on December 25, 1923, and was nicknamed the \"Christmas bottle.\" Today, the contour Coca-Cola bottle is one of the most recognized packages on the planet...\"even in the dark!\".<ref name=\"history-of-bottling\" />\n\nAs a reward for his efforts, Dean was offered a choice between a $500 bonus or a lifetime job at [[the Root Glass Company]]. He chose the lifetime job and kept it until the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] bought out [[the Root Glass Company]] in the mid-1930s. Dean went on to work in other Midwestern glass factories.{{citation needed|date = May 2014}}\n\nOne alternative depiction has [[Raymond Loewy]] as the inventor of the unique design, but, while Loewy did serve as a designer of Coke cans and bottles in later years, he was in the [[French Army]] the year the bottle was invented and did not emigrate to the United States until 1919.

In addition, Coca-Cola sponsors the annual [[Coca-Cola 600]] and [[Coke Zero 400]] for the [[NASCAR]] [[Sprint Cup Series]] at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]] in [[Concord, North Carolina]] and [[Daytona International Speedway]] in Daytona, Florida.\n\nCoca-Cola has a long history of sports marketing relationships, which over the years have included [[Major League Baseball]], the [[National Football League]], the [[National Basketball Association]], and the [[National Hockey League]], as well as with many teams within those leagues. Coca-Cola has had a longtime relationship with the NFL's [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], due in part to the now-famous [[Hey Kid, Catch!|1979 television commercial]] featuring [[Joe Greene (American football)|\"Mean Joe\" Greene]], leading to the two opening the Coca-Cola Great Hall at [[Heinz Field]] in 2001 and a more recent [[Coca-Cola Zero]] commercial featuring [[Troy Polamalu]].\n\nCoca-Cola is the official soft drink of many [[College football|collegiate football]] teams throughout the nation, partly due to Coca-Cola providing those schools with upgraded athletic facilities in exchange for Coca-Cola's sponsorship. This is especially prevalent at the high school level, which is more dependent on such contracts due to tighter budgets.\n\nCoca-Cola was one of the official sponsors of the [[1996 Cricket World Cup]] held on the [[Indian subcontinent]]. Coca-Cola is also one of the associate sponsors of [[Delhi Daredevils]] in the [[Indian Premier League]].\n\nIn England, Coca-Cola was the main sponsor of [[The Football League]] between 2004 and 2010, a name given to the three professional divisions below the [[Premier League]] in [[association football|soccer]] (football). In 2005, Coca-Cola launched a competition for the 72 clubs of The Football League&nbsp;\u2014 it was called \"Win a Player\". This allowed fans to place one vote per day for their favorite club, with one entry being chosen at random earning \u00a3250,000 for the club; this was repeated in 2006. The \"Win A Player\" competition was very controversial, as at the end of the 2 competitions, [[Leeds United A.F.C.]] had the most votes by more than double, yet they did not win any money to spend on a new player for the club. In 2007, the competition changed to \"Buy a Player\". This competition allowed fans to buy a bottle of Coca-Cola or Coca-Cola Zero and submit the code on the wrapper on the Coca-Cola website. This code could then earn anything from 50p to \u00a3100,000 for a club of their choice. This competition was favored over the old \"Win a Player\" competition, as it allowed all clubs to win some money.  Between 1992 and 1998, Coca-Cola was the title sponsor of the [[Football League Cup]] (Coca-Cola Cup), the secondary cup tournament of England.\n\nBetween 1994 and 1997, Coca-Cola was also the title sponsor of the [[Scottish League Cup]], renaming it the Coca-Cola Cup like its English counterpart.

The cofinality of a partially ordered set ''A'' can alternatively be defined as the least [[ordinal number|ordinal]] ''x'' such that there is a function from ''x'' to ''A'' with cofinal [[Image (mathematics)|image]]. This second definition makes sense without the axiom of choice. If the axiom of choice is assumed, as will be the case in the rest of this article, then the two definitions are equivalent.\n\nCofinality can be similarly defined for a [[directed set]] and is used to generalize the notion of a [[subsequence]] in a [[Net (mathematics)|net]].\n\n== Examples ==\n*  The cofinality of a partially ordered set with [[greatest element]] is 1 as the set consisting only of the greatest element is cofinal (and must be contained in every other cofinal subset).\n** In particular, the cofinality of any nonzero finite ordinal, or indeed any finite directed set, is 1, since such sets have a greatest element.\n* Every cofinal subset of a partially ordered set must contain all [[maximal element]]s of that set. Thus the cofinality of a finite partially ordered set is equal to the number of its maximal elements.\n** In particular, let ''A'' be a set of size ''n'', and consider the set of subsets of ''A'' containing no more than ''m'' elements.  This is partially ordered under inclusion and the subsets with ''m'' elements are maximal.  Thus the cofinality of this poset is ''n'' [[Binomial coefficient|choose]] ''m''.\n* A subset of the natural numbers '''N''' is cofinal in '''N''' if and only if it is infinite, and therefore the cofinality of &alefsym;<sub>0</sub> is &alefsym;<sub>0</sub>. Thus &alefsym;<sub>0</sub> is a [[regular cardinal]].\n* The cofinality of the [[real number]]s with their usual ordering is &alefsym;<sub>0</sub>, since '''N''' is cofinal in '''R'''.  The usual ordering of '''R''' is not [[order isomorphic]] to ''c'', the [[cardinality of the continuum|cardinality of the real numbers]], which has cofinality strictly greater than &alefsym;<sub>0</sub>.  This demonstrates that the cofinality depends on the order; different orders on the same set may have different cofinality.\n\n==Properties==\nIf ''A'' admits a [[total order|totally ordered]] cofinal subset, then we can find a subset ''B'' which is well-ordered and cofinal in ''A''. Any subset of ''B'' is also well-ordered. If two cofinal subsets of ''B'' have minimal cardinality (i.e. their cardinality is the cofinality of ''B''), then they are order isomorphic to each other.\n\n== Cofinality of ordinals and other well-ordered sets ==\nThe '''cofinality of an ordinal''' &alpha; is the smallest ordinal &delta; which is the [[order type]] of a [[cofinal subset]] of &alpha;.  The cofinality of a set of ordinals or any other [[well-ordered set]] is the cofinality of the order type of that set.\n\nThus for a [[limit ordinal]] &alpha;, there exists a &delta;-indexed strictly increasing sequence with limit &alpha;.  For example, the cofinality of \u03c9\u00b2 is \u03c9, because the sequence \u03c9\u00b7''m'' (where ''m'' ranges over the natural numbers) tends to \u03c9\u00b2; but, more generally, any countable limit ordinal has cofinality \u03c9.  An uncountable limit ordinal may have either cofinality \u03c9 as does &omega;<sub>&omega;</sub> or an uncountable cofinality.\n\nThe cofinality of 0 is 0. The cofinality of any [[successor ordinal]] is 1.  The cofinality of any nonzero limit ordinal is an infinite regular cardinal.\n\n== Regular and singular ordinals ==\n{{Main|Regular cardinal}}\nA '''regular ordinal''' is an ordinal which is equal to its cofinality. A '''singular ordinal''' is any ordinal which is not regular.\n\nEvery regular ordinal is the [[initial ordinal]] of a cardinal.  Any limit of regular ordinals is a limit of initial ordinals and thus is also initial but need not be regular. Assuming the axiom of choice, <math>\\omega_{\\alpha+1}</math> is regular for each \u03b1.  In this case, the ordinals 0, 1, <math>\\omega</math>, <math>\\omega_1</math>, and <math>\\omega_2</math> are regular, whereas 2, 3, <math>\\omega_\\omega</math>, and \u03c9<sub>\u03c9\u00b72</sub> are initial ordinals which are not regular.\n\nThe cofinality of any ordinal ''\u03b1'' is a regular ordinal, i.e. the cofinality of the cofinality of ''\u03b1'' is the same as the cofinality of ''\u03b1''.  So the cofinality operation is [[idempotent]].\n\n==Cofinality of cardinals==\nIf \u03ba is an infinite cardinal number, then cf(\u03ba) is the least cardinal such that there is an [[bounded (set theory)|unbounded]] function from cf(\u03ba) to \u03ba; cf(\u03ba) is also the cardinality of the smallest set of strictly smaller cardinals whose sum is \u03ba; more precisely\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{cf}(\\kappa) = \\min \\left\\{ \\mathrm{card}(I)\\ |\\ \\kappa = \\sum_{i \\in I} \\lambda_i\\ \\mathrm{and}\\ (\\forall i)(\\lambda_i < \\kappa)\\right\\}</math>\n\nThat the set above is nonempty comes from the fact that\n\n:<math>\\kappa = \\bigcup_{i \\in \\kappa} \\{i\\}</math>\n\ni.e. the [[disjoint union]] of \u03ba singleton sets. This implies immediately that cf(\u03ba) \u2264 \u03ba.\nThe cofinality of any totally ordered set is regular, so one has cf(\u03ba) = cf(cf(\u03ba)).\n\nUsing [[K\u00f6nig's theorem (set theory)|K\u00f6nig's theorem]], one can prove \u03ba < \u03ba<sup>cf(\u03ba)</sup> and \u03ba < cf(2<sup>\u03ba</sup>) for any infinite cardinal \u03ba.\n\nThe last inequality implies that the cofinality of the cardinality of the continuum must be uncountable. On the other hand,\n\n:<math> \\aleph_\\omega = \\bigcup_{n < \\omega} \\aleph_n </math>.\n\nthe ordinal number \u03c9 being the first infinite ordinal, so that the cofinality of <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> is card(\u03c9) = <math>\\aleph_0</math>.  (In particular, <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> is singular.) Therefore,\n\n:<math>2^{\\aleph_0}\\neq\\aleph_\\omega.</math>\n\n(Compare to the [[continuum hypothesis]], which states <math>2^{\\aleph_0}= \\aleph_1</math>.)\n\nGeneralizing this argument, one can prove that for a limit ordinal \u03b4\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{cf} (\\aleph_\\delta) = \\mathrm{cf} (\\delta) </math>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Initial ordinal]]\n\n==References==\n*Jech, Thomas, 2003.

It may be a [[fortress]], [[castle]], or fortified center. The term is a diminutive of \"city\" and thus means \"little city\", so called because it is a smaller part of the city of which it is the defensive core. [[Ancient Sparta]] had a citadel as did many other [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] cities and towns.\n\nIn a [[fortification]] with [[bastion]]s, the citadel is the strongest part of the system, sometimes well inside the outer walls and bastions, but often forming part of the outer wall for the sake of economy. It is positioned to be the last line of defense, should the enemy breach the other components of the fortification system. A citadel is also a term of the third part of a medieval castle, with higher walls than the rest. It was to be the last line of defense before the [[keep]] itself.\n\n==History==\n===3300\u20131300 BCE===\nSome of the oldest known structures which have served as citadels were built by the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], where the citadel represented a centralised authority.

Though the structures found in the ruins of [[Mohenjo-daro]] were walled, it is far from clear that these structures were defensive against enemy attacks. Rather, they may have been built to divert flood waters.\n\nSeveral settlements in [[Anatolia]], including the Assyrian city of Kane\u0161 in modern-day [[K\u00fcltepe]], featured citadels.

One such incident played an important part in the history of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the [[Seleucid Empire]]. The [[Hellenistic]] [[garrison]] of [[Jerusalem]] and local supporters of the Seleucids held out for many years in the [[Acra (fortress)|Acra]] citadel, making Maccabean rule in the rest of Jerusalem precarious. When finally gaining possession of the place, the Maccabeans pointedly destroyed and razed the Acra, though they constructed another citadel for their own use in a different part of Jerusalem.\n\n===500\u20131600===\n[[File:Si\u00e9ge de la flotte turc.jpg|thumb|Although much of [[Nice]] was ransacked during the 1543 [[Siege of Nice|siege of the city]], [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman]] forces besieging Nice were unable to capture its Citadel. Citadels have often been used as a last defence for a besieged army. ]]\nAt various periods, and particularly during the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], the citadel \u2013 having its own fortifications, independent of the city walls \u2013 was the last defence of a besieged army, often held after the town had been conquered. Locals and defending armies have often held out citadels long after the city had fallen. For example, in the 1543 [[Siege of Nice]] the Ottoman forces led by [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]] conquered and pillaged the town itself and took many captives \u2013 but the citadel itself held out.\n\nIn the [[Philippines]] The Ivatan people of the northern islands of [[Batanes]] often built fortifications to protect themselves during times of war. They built their so-called ''idjangs'' on hills and elevated areas.These fortifications were likened to European castles because of their purpose. Usually, the only entrance to the castles would be via a rope ladder that would only be lowered for the villagers and could be kept away when invaders arrived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filipiknow.net/archaeological-discoveries-in-the-philippines/|title=15 Most Intense Archaeological Discoveries in Philippine History|publisher=Filipknow}}</ref>\n\n===1600\u2013present===\nIn time of war the citadel in many cases afforded retreat to the people living in the areas around the town. However, Citadels were often used also to protect a garrison or political power from the inhabitants of the town where it was located, being designed to ensure loyalty from the town that they defended.\n[[File:Battle-1t.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Americans assault the citadel during the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]], 1968. The battle showcased the effectiveness of citadels in modern warfare.]]\nFor example, during the [[Dutch Wars]] of 1664-67, King [[Charles II of England]] constructed a Royal Citadel at [[Royal Citadel, Plymouth|Plymouth]], an important channel port which needed to be defended from a possible naval attack. However, due to Plymouth's support for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] in the then-recent [[English Civil War]], the Plymouth Citadel was so designed that its guns could fire on the town as well as on the sea approaches.\n\n[[Barcelona]] had a great citadel built in 1714 to intimidate the [[Catalan people|Catalans]] against repeating their mid-17th- and early-18th-century rebellions against the Spanish central government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 19th century, when the political climate had liberalized enough to permit it, the people of Barcelona had the citadel torn down, and replaced it with the city's main central park, the [[Parc de la Ciutadella]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} A similar example is the [[Citadella]] in [[Budapest]], Hungary.\n\nThe attack on the [[Bastille]] in the [[French Revolution]] \u2013 though afterwards remembered mainly for the release of the handful of prisoners incarcerated there \u2013 was to considerable degree motivated by the structure being a Royal citadel in the midst of revolutionary Paris.\n\nSimilarly, after [[Garibaldi]]'s overthrow of [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] rule in [[Palermo]], during the 1860 [[Unification of Italy]], Palermo's Castellamare Citadel \u2013 symbol of the hated and oppressive former rule \u2013 was ceremoniously demolished.\n\nFollowing Belgium declaring independence in 1830, a Dutch garrison under General [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9]] held out in [[Antwerp Citadel]] between 1830 and 1832, while the city itself had already become part of the independent Belgium.\n\nThe [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], in which the Nationalists held out against a much larger Republican force for two months until relieved, shows that in some cases a citadel can be effective even in modern warfare; a similar case is the [[Battle of Hu\u1ebf]] during the [[Vietnam war]], where a [[North Vietnamese Army]] division held the citadel of Hu\u1ebf for 26 days against roughly their own numbers of much better-equipped US and South Vietnamese troops.\n\n===Modern usage===\n[[File:Royal 22e R\u00e9giment - panoramio.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal 22nd Regiment]]'s home garrison is the [[Citadelle of Quebec]] in [[Canada]].

Medieval sources referred to armour of this type simply as ''mail'', however ''chain-mail'' has become a commonly used, if incorrect, [[neologism]] first attested in Sir Walter Scott's 1822 novel ''[[The Fortunes of Nigel]]''.<ref>{{Cite OED|chain-mail}}</ref> Since then the word ''mail'' has been commonly, if incorrectly, applied to other types of armour, such as in ''plate-mail'' (first attested in 1835).<ref>{{Cite OED|plate-mail}}</ref> The more correct term is ''[[plate armour]]''.\n\nCivilizations that used mail invented specific terms for each garment made from it. The standard terms for European mail armour derive from French: leggings are called [[chausses]], a hood is a [[mail coif]], and mittens, [[mitons]]. A mail collar hanging from a helmet is a [[camail]] or [[aventail]]. A shirt made from mail is a [[hauberk]] if knee-length and a [[haubergeon]] if mid-thigh length. A layer (or layers) of mail sandwiched between layers of fabric is called a [[jazerant]].\n\nA waist-length coat in medieval Europe was called a byrnie, although the exact construction of a byrnie is unclear, including whether it was constructed of mail or other armour-types. Noting that the byrnie was the \"most highly valued piece of armour\" to the [[Charlemagne|Carolingian]] soldier, Bennet, Bradbury, DeVries, Dickie, and Jestice<ref>Bennet, M., Bradbury, J., DeVries, K., Dickie, I., & Jestice, P. ''Fighting Techniques of the Medieval World''. Thomas Dunne Books, 2005, p. 82</ref> indicate that:\n\n<blockquote>There is some dispute among historians as to what exactly constituted the Carolingian byrnie. Relying... only on artistic and some literary sources because of the lack of archaeological examples, some believe that it was a heavy leather jacket with metal scales sewn onto it. It was also quite long, reaching below the hips and covering most of the arms. Other historians claim instead that the Carolingian byrnie was nothing more than a coat of mail, but longer and perhaps heavier than traditional early medieval mail. Without more certain evidence, this dispute will continue.</blockquote>\n\n==In Europe==\n[[File:MWP Pancerni 2 polowa 17 wieku.jpg|thumb|right|Mail armour and equipment of Polish medium cavalryman, from the second half of the 17th century]]\nThe use of mail as battlefield armour was common during the [[Iron Age]] and the [[Middle Ages]], becoming less common over the course of the 16th and 17th centuries.

Mail from dead combatants was frequently looted and was used by the new owner or sold for a lucrative price. As time went on and infrastructure improved, it came to be used by more soldiers. Eventually with the rise of the lanced [[cavalry charge]], impact warfare, and high-powered [[crossbows]], mail came to be used as a secondary armour to plate for the mounted nobility.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nBy the 14th century, [[plate armour]] was commonly used to supplement mail. Eventually mail was supplanted by plate for the most part, as it provided greater protection against windlass crossbows, bludgeoning weapons, and lance charges. However, mail was still widely used by many soldiers as well as [[brigandine]]s and [[padded jack]]s. These three types of armour made up the bulk of the equipment used by soldiers, with mail being the most expensive.

Mail was commonly also used as horse armour for [[cataphracts]] and heavy cavalry as well as armour for the soldiers themselves. Asian mail could be just as heavy as the European variety and sometimes had prayer symbols stamped on the rings as a sign of their craftsmanship as well as for divine protection.<ref>David G Alexander, Decorated and inscribed mail shirts in the Metropolitan Museum, Waffen- und Kostumkunde 27 (1985), 29\u201336</ref> Indeed, mail armour is mentioned in the [[Quran]] as being a gift revealed by Allah to David:\n\n<blockquote>21:80 It was We Who taught him the making of coats of mail for your benefit, to guard you from each other's violence: will ye then be grateful? (Yusuf Ali's translation)</blockquote>\n\nFrom the Middle East, mail was quickly adopted in Central Asia by the Sogdians and by India in the South. Mail armour was introduced by the [[Turkish people|turks]]  in late 12th century and commonly used by [[Turkic peoples|Turk]]  and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]  armies  where it eventually became the armour of choice in India. Indian mail was constructed with alternating rows of solid links and round riveted links and it was often integrated with plate protection (mail and plate armour). [[Mail and plate armour]] was commonly used in India until the [[Battle of Plassey]] and the subsequent British conquest of the sub-continent.\n\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] used mail armour as well as mail and plate armour, and it was used in their armies until the 18th century by heavy cavalry and elite units such as the Janissaries. They spread its use into North Africa where it was adopted by [[Mamluk]] Egyptians and the Sudanese who produced it until the early 20th century. Ottoman mail was constructed with alternating rows of solid links and round riveted links. The Persians used mail armour as well as mail and plate armour. Persian mail and Ottoman mail were often quite similar in appearance.\n\nMail was introduced to [[China]] when its allies in Central Asia paid tribute to the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Emperor]] in 718 by giving him a coat of \"link armour\" assumed to be mail. China first encountered the armour in 384 when its allies in the nation of [[Kuchi]] arrived wearing \"armour similar to chains\". Once in China, mail was imported but was not produced widely. Due to its flexibility, comfort, and rarity, it was typically the armour of high-ranking guards and those who could afford the exotic import (to show off their social status) rather than the armor of the rank and file, who used more common brigandine, scale, and [[Lamellar armour|lamellar]] types. However, it was one of the only military products that China imported from foreigners. Mail spread to Korea slightly later where it was imported as the armour of imperial guards and generals.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Japanese mail armour===\n{{Main|Kusari (Japanese mail armour)}}\n[[File:Japanese kusari armor.JPG|thumb|right|Edo period Japanese (samurai) chain armour or kusari gusoku]]\n\nIn [[Japan]] mail is called ''[[Commons:Category:Japanese chain mail|kusari]]'' which means chain.

Mail, if a warrior could afford it, provided a significant advantage when combined with competent fighting techniques. When the mail was not riveted, a thrust from most sharp weapons could penetrate it. However, when mail was riveted, only a strong well-placed thrust from certain spears, or thin or dedicated mail-piercing swords like the [[estoc]] could penetrate, and a [[Pollaxe (polearm)|pollaxe]] or [[halberd]] blow could break through the armour. Strong projectile weapons such as stronger self bows, recurve bows, and crossbows could also penetrate riveted mail.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYsr81y0Aeo</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSL7XApz2s|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223060132/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NGSL7XApz2s|archivedate=2017-12-23|df=|title =Arms & Armor 12th Century Spear VS.

Mail-clad warriors typically wore separate rigid [[helmet|helms]] over their mail coifs for head protection. Likewise, blunt weapons such as [[mace (bludgeon)|maces]] and [[war hammer|warhammers]] could harm the wearer by their impact without penetrating the armour; usually a soft armour, such as [[gambeson]], was worn under the hauberk. Medieval surgeons were very well capable of setting and caring for bone fractures resulting from blunt weapons.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Mitchell, Piers D.

In Europe, the 4-to-1 pattern was completely dominant. Mail was also common in East Asia, primarily Japan, with several more patterns being utilised and an entire nomenclature developing around them.\n\nHistorically, in Europe, from the pre-Roman period on, the rings composing a piece of mail would be [[rivet]]ed closed to reduce the chance of the rings splitting open when subjected to a thrusting attack or a hit by an arrow.\n\nUp until the 14th century European mail was made of alternating rows of round riveted rings and solid rings. Sometime during the 14th century European mail makers started to transition from round rivets to wedge shaped rivets but continued using alternating rows of solid rings. Eventually European mail makers stopped using solid rings and almost all European mail was made from wedge riveted rings only with no solid rings.<ref name=Example2006>{{Cite journal | last1 = Richardson | first1 = T. | title = Armour in England, 1325\u201399 | doi = 10.1016/j.jmedhist.2011.06.001 | journal = Journal of Medieval History | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 304\u2013320 | year = 2011 | pmid =  | pmc = }}</ref> Both were commonly made of [[wrought iron]], but some later pieces were made of heat-treated steel. Wire for the riveted rings was formed by either of two methods. One was to hammer out wrought iron into plates and cut or slit the plates. These thin pieces were then pulled through a [[draw plate]] repeatedly until the desired diameter was achieved. [[Waterwheel]] powered drawing mills are pictured in several period manuscripts. Another method was to simply forge down an iron [[Billet (bar stock)|billet]] into a rod and then proceed to draw it out into wire. The solid links would have been made by punching from a sheet. Guild marks were often stamped on the rings to show their origin and craftsmanship. [[Forge welding]] was also used to create solid links, but there are few possible examples known; the only well documented example from Europe is that of the camail (mail neck-defence) of the 7th century [[Coppergate helmet]].<ref>[[Dominic Tweddle]], The Anglian Helmet from Coppergate, Archaeology of York 17/8, York Archaeological Trust 1992</ref> Outside of Europe this practice was more common such as \"theta\" links from India. Very few examples of historic butted mail have been found and it is generally accepted that butted mail was never in wide use historically except in Japan where mail (''kusari'') was commonly made from ''butted'' links.<ref name=b1/> Butted link mail was also used by the Moros of the Philippines in their mail and plate armors.\n\n==Modern uses==\n\n===Practical uses===\n[[File:Neptunic shark suit 1.jpg|thumb|170px|Neptunic shark suit]]\nMail is used as protective clothing for butchers against meat-packing equipment.

Shark expert and underwater filmmaker [[Ron & Valerie Taylor|Valerie Taylor]] was among the first to develop and test [[shark suit]]s in 1979 while diving with sharks.\n\nMail is widely used in industrial settings as shrapnel guards and splash guards in metal working operations.\n\nElectrical applications for mail include RF leakage testing and being worn as a [[faraday cage]] suit by tesla coil enthusiasts and high voltage electrical workers.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Douglas, David (director)|publisher=Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum|title=Straight Up: Helicopters in Action|date=2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Blake|first=Terry|title=Dr Zeus - Testing of HV Suit w Twin Musical Tesla Coils|url=http://www.dr-zeus.com/|work=Daily Planet Segment 2008|publisher=Discovery Channel|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829073945/http://www.dr-zeus.com/|archivedate=2011-08-29|df=}}</ref>\n\n====Stab-proof vests====\n{{main|Stab vest}}\nConventional textile-based ballistic vests are designed to stop soft-nosed bullets but offer little defense from knife attacks.

Mail is especially popular amongst those groups which use steel weapons. A modern hauberk made from 1.5&nbsp;mm diameter wire with 10&nbsp;mm inner diameter rings weighs roughly {{convert|10|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and contains 15,000\u201345,000 rings.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nOne of the drawbacks of mail is the uneven weight distribution; the stress falls mainly on shoulders. Weight can be better distributed by wearing a belt over the mail, which provides another point of support.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nMail worn today for re-enactment and recreational use can be made in a variety of styles and materials. Most recreational mail today is made of butted links which are galvanized or stainless steel. This is historically inaccurate but is much less expensive to procure and especially to maintain than historically accurate reproductions. Mail can also be made of titanium, aluminium, bronze, or copper. Riveted mail offers significantly better protection ability as well as historical accuracy than mail constructed with butted links. Riveted mail can be more labour-intensive and expensive to manufacture.{{Citation needed|reason=Citation needed for the statement that rivited mail offers \"significantly\" better protection|date=February 2018}} Japanese mail (''kusari'') is one of the few historically correct examples of mail being constructed with such ''butted links''.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Decorative uses===\n[[File:Major's shoulder chains.JPG|thumb|Major's shoulder chains]]\n[[File:ChainMaille Dragon's Back Bracelet or Roundmaille Weave.jpg|150px|thumb|A modern example of the use of ''mail'', a bracelet using the ''roundmaille weave''.]]\nMail remained in use as a decorative and possibly high-status symbol with military overtones long after its practical usefulness had passed. It was frequently used for the [[epaulette]]s of military uniforms. It is still used in this form by the British [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]].\n\nMail has applications in sculpture and jewellery, especially when made out of precious metals or colourful [[anodizing|anodized]] metals. Mail artwork includes headdresses, decorative wall hangings, ornaments, chess sets, macrame, and jewelry. For these non-traditional applications, hundreds of patterns (commonly referred to as 'weaves') have been invented.<ref>[http://rescyou.deviantart.com/gallery/ DeviantArt.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619085702/http://rescyou.deviantart.com/gallery/ |date=2009-06-19 }}</ref>\n\nLarge-linked mail is occasionally used as a fetish clothing material, with the large links intended to reveal \u2013 in part \u2013 the body beneath them.\n\n==In film==\n{{norefs|section|date = May 2018}}\nIn some films, knitted string spray-painted with a metallic paint is used instead of actual mail in order to cut down on cost (an example being ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'', which was filmed on a very small budget). Films more dedicated to costume accuracy often use [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS plastic]] rings, for the lower cost and weight. Such ABS mail coats were made for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], in addition to many metal coats. The metal coats are used rarely because of their weight, except in close-up filming where the appearance of ABS rings is distinguishable. A large scale example of the ABS mail used in the ''Lord of the Rings'' can be seen in the entrance to the [[Royal Armouries]] museum in Leeds in the form of a large curtain bearing the logo of the museum. It was acquired from the makers of the film's armour, [[Weta Workshop]], when the museum hosted an exhibition of WETA armour from their films. For the film ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', Tina Turner is said to have worn actual mail and she complained how heavy this was. Game of Thrones makes use of mail, notably during the \"Red Wedding\" scene.\n<!-- To be relocated: {{cite web |url = http://www.wetanz.com/armour-chainmaille/|title = Weta Workshop Armour & Chainmaille|accessdate = 11 August 2012 }} -->\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=packed style=\"text-align:left\">\nFile:Kusari tabi.JPG|Edo period 1800s Japanese (samurai) mail socks or ''kusari tabi'', butted rings.\nFile:Kusari katabira 6.JPG|Japanese Edo period mail jacket, butted rings ''[[Commons:Category:Japanese chain mail|kusari katabira]]''.\nFile:Kusari kote.JPG|Edo period Japanese (samurai) mail gauntlets ''kusari han kote'', butted rings.\nFile:Rriveted kusari kote.jpg|A rare example of Japanese riveted mail, round riveted rings.\nFile:Kusari examples.JPG|Examples of Edo period Japanese (samurai) mail ''kusari''.\nFile:Riveted armor and plate.JPG|Close up of Mughal riveted mail and plate coat ''zirah Bagtar'', 17th century, alternating rows of solid rings and round riveted rings.\nFile:Eastern riveted hood detail.JPG|Close up detail of Mughal riveted mail hood ''kulah zirah'', 17th century, alternating rows of round riveted rings and solid rings.\nFile:Eastern riveted armor 1.JPG|Mughal riveted mail and plate coat ''zirah Bagtar'', 17th century, alternating rows of round riveted rings and solid rings.\nFile:Eastern riveted armor hood.JPG|Mughal riveted mail hood ''kulah zirah. 17th century, alternating rows of round riveted rings and solid rings.\nFile:Morgan Bible 28r detail.jpg|\"[[David (biblical king)|David]] rejects the unaccustomed armour\" (detail of fol. 28r of the 13th century [[Morgan Bible]]).

Upon his entering the underworld, all the dead flee Heracles except for [[Meleager]] and the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]]. Heracles drew his sword against Medusa, but Hermes told Heracles that the dead are mere \"empty phantoms\". Heracles asked Hades (here called Pluto) for Cerberus, and Hades said that Heracles could take Cerberus provided he was able to subdue him without using weapons. Heracles found Cerberus at the gates of [[Acheron]], and with his arms around Cerberus, though being bitten by Cerberus' serpent tail, Heracles squeezed until Cerberus submitted. Heracles carried Cerberus away, showed him to Eurystheus, then returned Cerberus to the underworld.\n\nIn an apparently unique version of the story, related by the sixth-century AD [[Pseudo-Nonnus]], Heracles descended into Hades to abduct Persephone, and killed Cerberus on his way back up.<ref>[[Pseudo-Nonnus]], 4.51 (Nimmo Smith, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzZnMCP4JRIC&pg=PA37 p. 37]); Ogden 2013a, [https://books.google.com/books?id=FQ2pAK9luwkC&pg=PA114 p. 114].</ref>\n\n== Iconography ==\n[[File:Skyphos aus Argos.JPG|thumb|350px|One of the two earliest depictions of the capture of Cerberus (composed of the last five figures on the right) shows, from right to left: Cerberus, with a single dog head and snakes rising from his body, fleeing right, Hermes, with his characteristic hat (''[[petasos]]'') and [[caduceus]], Heracles, with quiver on his back, stone in left hand, and bow in right, a goddess, standing in front of Hades' throne, facing Heracles, and Hades, with scepter, fleeing left.

Ogden<ref>Ogden 2013a, p. 105.</ref> refers to attempts to establish an Indo-European etymology as \"not yet successful\".  It has been claimed to be related to the [[Sanskrit]] word \u0938\u0930\u094d\u0935\u0930\u093e ''sarvar\u0101'', used as an epithet of one of the dogs of [[Yama]], from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] word *''k\u0311\u00e9rberos'', meaning \"spotted\".<ref>{{cite book\n| last1                 = Mallory\n| first1                = J.

Lincoln notes a similarity between Cerberus and the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] dog [[Garmr]], relating both names to a Proto-Indo-European root ''*ger-'' \"to growl\" (perhaps with the suffixes ''-*m/*b'' and ''-*r''). However, as Ogden observes, this analysis actually requires ''Kerberos'' and ''Garmr'' to be derived from two ''different'' Indo-European roots (*''ker-'' and *''gher-'' respectively), and so does not actually establish a relationship between the two names.\n\nThough probably not Greek, Greek etymologies for Cerberus have been offered.

The serpent was called the \"hound of Hades\" only because anyone bitten by it died immediately, and it was this snake that Heracles brought to Eurystheus. The geographer Pausanias (who preserves for us Hecataeus' version of the story) points out that, since Homer does not describe Cerberus, Hecataeus' account does not necessarily conflict with Homer, since Homer's \"Hound of Hades\" may not in fact refer to an actual dog.<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.25.6 3.25.6].</ref>\n\nOther rationalized accounts make Cerberus out to be a normal dog.

Heracles killed Orthus, and drove away Geryon's cattle, with Cerberus following along behind. Molossus, a Mycenaen, offered to buy Cerberus from Eurystheus (presumably having received the dog, along with the cattle, from Heracles). But when Eurystheus refused, Molossus stole the dog and penned him up in a cave in Tainaron. Eurystheus commanded Heracles to find Cerberus and bring him back. After searching the entire Peloponnesus, Heracles found where it was said Cerberus was being held, went down into the cave, and brought up Cerberus, after which it was said: \"Heracles descended through the cave into Hades and brought up Cerberus.\"\n\nIn the rationalized account of [[Philochorus]], in which Heracles rescues Theseus, Perithous is eaten by Cerberus.<ref>[[Philochorus]], ''FGrH'' 328 F18a (= [[Plutarch]], ''Theseus'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0067%3Achapter%3D35%3Asection%3D1 35.1]), F18b, F18c; Harding, [https://books.google.com/books?id=KH4T9CBXwEEC&pg=PA68 pp. 68\u201370]; Ogden 2013b, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ir5FhAQbcfAC&pg=PA73 p. 73]; Ogden 2013a, p. 109; Gantz, p. 295; Collard and Cropp, [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/euripides-dramatic_fragments/2008/pb_LCL506.637.xml p. 637].

This earth, swallowing up bodies, sends souls to Tartarus.\"<ref>[[Second Vatican Mythographer]], 13 (Pepin, p. 106); [[Third Vatican Mythographer]] 6.22 (Pepin, p. 171). For others who associated Cerberus' three heads with the three continents see Brumble, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6KygKVV5l7YC&pg=PA69 p. 69].</ref>\n\nVirgil described Cerberus as \"ravenous\" (''fame rabida''),<ref>[[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Verg.+A.+6.421 6.421].</ref> and a rapacious Cerberus became proverbial.

Common examples include \"[[iPhone]]\" and \"[[eBay]]\". It is also sometimes used in online usernames such as \"johnSmith\", and to make multi-word [[domain names]] more legible, for example in advertisements.\n\nCamel case is often used for variable names in computer programming.

Some people and organizations, notably [[Microsoft]],<ref name=nfrmwk/> use the term ''camel case'' only for lower camel case.  ''Pascal case'' means only upper camel case.\n\nCamel case is distinct from [[Title Case]], which capitalises all words but retains the spaces between them, and from [[Tall Man lettering]], which uses capitals to emphasize the differences between similar-looking words such as \"predniSONE\" and \"predniSOLONE\". Camel case is also distinct from [[snake case]], which uses [[underscores]] interspersed with lowercase letters (sometimes with the first letter capitalized). The combination of \"upper camel case\" and \"snake case\" is known as \"Darwin case\". Darwin case uses [[underscores]] between words with initial uppercase letters, as in \"Sample_Type\". It has no known conventional use in computer programming but is named after [[Charles Darwin]] because of the way it has \"evolved\" from more traditional conventions.{{citation needed|reason=invented by whom, named by whom, where and when is it used?|date=October 2018}}\n\n== Variations and synonyms ==\nThe original name of the practice, used in [[media studies]], [[grammar]]s and the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', was \"medial capitals\".

However, mid-word capitalisation does not conform to [[German orthography]]; the previous example could be correctly written using [[parentheses]] as ''Student(inn)en'', analogous to \"congress(wo)man\" in English.<ref>{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title= ''Richtiges und gutes Deutsch: Das W\u00f6rterbuch der sprachlichen Zweifelsf\u00e4lle'' |series=Duden |volume=9 |location=Mannheim |publisher=Bibliographisches Institut |page=418 |date=2011 |edition=7th |isbn=978-3411040971 |language=German}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Irish orthography|Irish]], camelcase is used when an inflectional prefix is attached to a proper noun, for example {{lang|ga|i nGaillimh}} (\"in [[Galway]]\"), from {{lang|ga|Gaillimh}} (\"Galway\");  {{lang|ga|an tAlbanach}} (\"the Scottish person\"), from {{lang|ga|Albanach}} (\"Scottish person\"); and {{lang|ga|go h\u00c9irinn}} (\"to [[Ireland]]\"), from {{lang|ga|\u00c9ire}} (\"Ireland\"). In recent [[Scottish Gaelic alphabet|Scots Gaelic orthography]], a hyphen has been inserted: {{lang|ga|an t-Albannach}}.\n\nThis convention is also used by several written [[Bantu languages]] (e.g., ''kiSwahili'', \"[[Swahili language]]\"; ''isiZulu'', \"[[Zulu language]]\") and several indigenous [[languages of Mexico]] (e.g. [[Nahuatl languages|Nahuatl]], [[Totonacan languages|Totonacan]], [[Mixe\u2013Zoque languages|Mixe\u2013Zoque]], and some [[Oto-Manguean languages]]).\n\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]], when capitalizing the digraph ''[[IJ (digraph)|ij]]'', both the letter ''I'' and the letter ''J'' are capitalized, for example in the countryname ''[[Iceland|IJsland]]''.\n\nIn English, medial capitals are usually only found in Scottish or Irish \"Mac-\" or \"Mc-\" names, where for example ''MacDonald, McDonald,'' and ''Macdonald'' are common spelling variants of the same name, and in Anglo-Norman \"Fitz-\" names, where for example both ''FitzGerald'' and ''Fitzgerald'' are found.\n\nIn their English style guide ''[[The King's English]]'', first published in 1906, [[Henry Watson Fowler|H. W.]] and [[Francis George Fowler|F. G. Fowler]] suggested that medial capitals could be used in triple [[compound word]]s where [[hyphen]]s would cause ambiguity\u2014the examples they give are ''KingMark-like'' (as against ''King Mark-like'') and ''Anglo-SouthAmerican'' (as against ''Anglo-South American''). However, they described the system as \"too hopelessly contrary to use at present.\"<ref>\n{{Cite book\n|last1=Fowler\n|first1=Henry W.\n|authorlink1=Henry Watson Fowler\n|last2=Fowler\n|first2=Francis G.\n|authorlink2=Francis George Fowler\n|title=The King's English\n|url=http://www.bartleby.com/116/\n|accessdate=19 December 2009\n|publisher=[[Oxford University Press|Oxford]]\n|edition=2nd\n|year=1908\n|chapter=Chapter IV. Punctuation \u2013 Hyphens\n|chapterurl=http://www.bartleby.com/116/405.html}}\n</ref>\n\n===In transliterations===\n\nIn the scholarly transliteration of languages written in other scripts, medial capitals are used in similar situations. For example, in transliterated [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''ha'<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman\">I</span>vri'' means \"the Hebrew person\" or \"the Jew\" and ''b'Yerushalayim'' means \"in Jerusalem\".  In [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] proper names like ''rLobsang'', the \"r\" stands for a prefix glyph in the original script that functions as [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] marker rather than a normal letter. Another example is ''ts<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman\">I</span>urku'', a Latin transcription of the [[Chechen language|Chechen]] term for the capping stone of the characteristic [[Vainakh medieval towers|Medieval defensive towers]] of [[Chechenia]] and [[Ingushetia]]; the capital letter \"<span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman\">I</span>\" here denoting a [[phoneme]] distinct from the one transcribed as \"i\".\n\n=== In abbreviations ===\nMedial capitals are traditionally used in abbreviations to reflect the capitalization that the words would have when written out in full, for example in the academic titles [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] or [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]]. In German, the names of statutes are abbreviated using embedded capitals, e.g. StGB (Strafgesetzbuch) for Criminal Code, PatG (Patentgesetz) for Patent Act, BVerfG (Bundesverfassungsgericht) for [[Federal Constitutional Court]], or the very common GmbH (Gesellschaft mit beschr\u00e4nkter Haftung) for [[Private limited company|Company with Limited Liability]]. In this context, there can even be three or more \"CamelCase\" capitals, e.g. in TzBfG for Teilzeit- und Befristungsgesetz (Act on Part-Time and Limited Term Occupations). In French, camel case acronyms such as [[Oulipo|OuLiPo]] (1960) were favored for a time as alternatives to initialisms.\n\nCamel case is often used to transliterate initialisms into alphabets where two letters may be required to represent a single character of the original alphabet, e.g., [[DShK]] from [[Cyrillic]] \u0414\u0428\u041a. <!-- Need a real example for the following: In [[Japan]], Camel case is sometimes used when transliterating [[Hiragana]] or [[Katakana]] product names or initialisms into Roman alphabet. -->\n\n== History of modern technical use ==\n\n=== Chemical formulae ===\nThe first systematic and widespread use of medial capitals for technical purposes was the notation for chemical formulae invented by the Swedish chemist [[J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius|Jacob Berzelius]] in 1813. To replace the multitude of naming and symbol conventions used by chemists until that time, he proposed to indicate each chemical element by a symbol of one or two letters, the first one being capitalized. The capitalization allowed formulae like \"NaCl\" to be written without spaces and still be parsed without ambiguity.<ref>[[J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius]] (1813). ''Essay on the Cause of Chemical Proportions and on Some Circumstances Relating to Them: Together with a Short and Easy Method of Expressing Them''. ''[[Annals of Philosophy]]'' 2, 443-454, 3, 51-52; (1814) 93-106, 244-255, 353-364.</ref><ref>Henry M. Leicester & Herbert S. Klickstein, eds. 1952, ''A Source Book in Chemistry, 1400-1900'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard)</ref>\n\nBerzelius' system continues to be used, augmented with three-letter symbols such as \"[[ununennium|Uue]]\" for unconfirmed or unknown elements and abbreviations for some common substituents (especially in the field of organic chemistry, for instance \"[[Ethyl group|Et]]\" for \"ethyl-\"). This has been further extended to describe the [[amino acid]] sequences of [[protein]]s and other similar domains.\n\n=== Early use in trademarks ===\nSince the early 20th century, medial capitals have occasionally been used for [[corporation|corporate]] names and product [[trademark]]s, such as\n* ''DryIce Corporation'' (1925) marketed the solid form of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO\u2082) as \"Dry Ice\", thus leading to its common name.<ref name=\"About Dry ice\">{{Cite book| title=The Trade-mark Reporter| publisher=[[International Trademark Association|United States Trademark Association]]| year=1930| issue=v. 20| isbn=1-59888-091-8}}</ref>\n* [[CinemaScope]] and [[VistaVision]], rival [[widescreen]] [[film|movie]] formats (1953)\n* [[ShopKo Stores Inc.|ShopKo]] (1962)\n* ''MisteRogers'', the [[Canada|Canadian]] version of ''[[Mister Rogers' Neighborhood]]'' (1962)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imdb.com/title/tt0250165/ |title=\"MisteRogers\" (1962) |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=4 January 2014}}</ref>\n* [[AstroTurf]] (1967)<!-- Trademark serial number 72286166 -->\n* [[ConAgra Foods Inc.|ConAgra]], formerly Consolidated Mills (1971).\n* [[MasterCraft Boat Company|MasterCraft]] (1968)\n\n=== Computer programming ===\n{{Original research|section|reason=few citations and internet search shows no original sources, only sources that got it from Wikipedia|date=May 2011}}\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, medial capitals were adopted as a standard or alternative [[naming convention (programming)|naming convention]] for multi-word [[Identifier (computer programming)|identifier]]s in several [[programming language]]s. The precise origin of the convention in computer programming has not yet been settled. A 1954 conference proceedings<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/mit/summer_session_1954/Digital_Computers_Advanced_Coding_Techniques_Summer_1954.pdf |title=\"Resume of Session 8\".

The alternative of running the words together as in <code>endoffile</code> or <code>chartable</code> is difficult to understand and possibly misleading; for example, <code>chartable</code> is an English word (able to be charted).\n\nSome early programming languages, notably [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] (1958) and [[COBOL]] (1959), addressed this problem by allowing a [[hyphen]] (\"-\") to be used between words of compound identifiers, as in \"END-OF-FILE\": Lisp because it worked well with prefix notation (a Lisp parser would not treat a hyphen in the middle of a symbol as a subtraction operator) and COBOL because its operators were individual English words. This convention remains in use in these languages, and is also common in program names entered on a [[command line]], as in Unix.\n\nHowever, this solution was not adequate for mathematically-oriented languages such as [[FORTRAN]] (1955) and [[ALGOL 58|ALGOL]] (1958), which used the hyphen as an infix subtraction operator. These early languages instead allowed identifiers to contain unrestricted embedded spaces, determining the end of the identifier by context. This approach was abandoned in later languages due to the complexity it adds to [[Lexical analysis#Tokenization|tokenization]]. (FORTRAN initially restricted identifiers to no more than six characters, effectively preventing multi-word identifiers except those made of very short words, such as \"GO TO\"=\"GOTO\".)\n\nExacerbating the problem, common [[punched card]] character sets of the time were uppercase only and lacked other special characters. It was only in the late 1960s that the widespread adoption of the [[ASCII]] character set made both lowercase and the [[underscore]] character <code>_</code> universally available. Some languages, notably [[C (programming language)|C]], promptly adopted underscores as word separators, and identifiers such as <code>end_of_file</code> are still prevalent in C programs and libraries (as well as in later languages influenced by C, such as [[Perl]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]). However, some languages and programmers chose to avoid underscores\u2014among other reasons to prevent confusing them with [[Whitespace character|whitespace]]\u2014and adopted camel case instead.\n\n[[Charles Simonyi]], who worked at [[Xerox PARC]] in the 1970s and later oversaw the creation of Microsoft's Office suite of applications, invented and taught the use of [[Hungarian Notation]], one version of which uses the lowercase letter(s) at the start of a (capitalized) variable name to denote its type. One account{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} claims that the camel case style first became popular at Xerox PARC around 1978, with the [[Mesa (programming language)|Mesa programming language]] developed for the [[Xerox Alto]] computer. This machine lacked an underscore key, and the hyphen and space characters were not permitted in identifiers, leaving camel case as the only viable scheme for readable multiword names. The PARC Mesa Language Manual (1979) included a coding standard with specific rules for upper and lower camel case that was strictly followed by the Mesa libraries and the Alto operating system.\n\nThe [[Smalltalk]] language, which was developed originally on the Alto and became quite popular in the early 1980s, may{{according to whom|date=January 2017}} have been instrumental in spreading the style outside PARC. Camel case was also used by convention for many names in the [[PostScript]] page description language (invented by [[Adobe Systems]] founder and ex-PARC scientist [[John Warnock]]), as well as for the language itself. In addition, [[Niklaus Wirth]], the inventor of [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], came to appreciate camel case during a sabbatical at PARC and used it in [[Modula]], his next programming language.\n\n=== Spread to mainstream usage ===\nWhatever its origins within the computing world, the practice spread in the 1980s and 1990s, when the advent of the [[personal computer]] exposed hacker culture to the world. Camel case then became fashionable for corporate [[trade name]]s, initially in technical fields; mainstream usage was well established by 1990:\n<!-- This is documentation of increasing commercial usage, not a complete list.

Such usages erode quickly, so the neighborhoods are now typically rendered as ''Soho'', ''Tribeca'', and ''Soma''.\n\nInternal capitalization has also been used for other technical codes like [[HeLa]] (1983).\n\n== Current usage in computing ==\n\n=== Programming and coding ===\n{{main article|Naming convention (programming)}}\nThe use of medial caps for compound identifiers is recommended by the [[coding style]] guidelines of many organizations or software projects. For some languages (such as [[Mesa (programming language)|Mesa]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Modula]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]]) this practice is recommended by the language developers or by authoritative manuals and has therefore become part of the language's \"culture\".\n\nStyle guidelines often distinguish between upper and lower camel case, typically specifying which variety should be used for specific kinds of entities: [[variable (computer science)|variable]]s, [[field (computer science)|record fields]], [[method (computer science)|method]]s, [[procedure (computer science)|procedures]], [[type (computer science)|types]], etc. These rules are sometimes supported by [[static code analysis|static analysis]] tools that check source code for adherence.\n\nThe original [[Hungarian notation]] for programming, for example, specifies that a lowercase abbreviation for the \"usage type\" (not data type) should prefix all variable names, with the remainder of the name in upper camel case; as such it is a form of lower camel case.\n\nProgramming identifiers often need to contain [[acronyms and initialisms]] that are already in uppercase, such as \"old HTML file\". By analogy with the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the abbreviation all in uppercase, namely \"oldHTMLFile\". However, this approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., \"parse DBM XML\" would become \"parseDBMXML\") or when the standard mandates lower camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. \"SQL server\" would become \"sQLServer\"). For this reason, some programmers prefer to treat abbreviations as if they were lowercase words and write \"oldHtmlFile\", \"parseDbmXml\" or \"sqlServer\". However, this can make it harder to recognise that a given word is intended as an acronym.<ref>{{cite journal|title=To CamelCase or Under_score|author1=Dave Binkley|author2=Marcia Davis|author3=Dawn Lawrie|author4=Christopher Morrell|citeseerx=10.1.1.158.9499|publisher=IEEE|pages=158\u2013167|journal=IEEE 17th International Conference on Program Comprehension, 2009. ICPC '09.|year=2009|quote=In terms of camel-cased identifiers, this has a greater impact on identifiers that include short words and especially acronyms. For example, consider the acronym ID found in the identifier kIOuterIIDPath. Because of the run of uppercase letters, the task of reading kIOuterIIDPath, in particular the identification of the word ID, is more difficult.}}</ref>\n\n=== Wiki link markup ===\nCamel case is used in some [[wikitext|wiki markup languages]] for terms that should be automatically linked to other [[wiki]] pages. This convention was originally used in [[Ward Cunningham]]'s original [[wiki software]], [[WikiWikiWeb]], and can be activated in most other wikis. Some wiki engines such as [[TiddlyWiki]], [[Trac]] and [[PmWiki]] make use of it in the default settings, but usually also provide a configuration mechanism or [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] to disable it. [[Wikipedia]] formerly used camel case linking as well, but switched to explicit link markup using [[square brackets]] and many other wiki sites have done the same. Some wikis that do not use camel case linking may still use the camel case as a naming convention, such as [[AboutUs]].\n\n=== Other uses ===\nThe [[National Information Exchange Model|NIEM]] registry requires that [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] data elements use upper camel case and XML attributes use lower camel case.\n\nMost popular [[command-line interface]]s and [[shell script|scripting]] languages cannot easily handle file names that contain embedded spaces (usually requiring the name to be put in quotes). Therefore, users of those systems often resort to camel case (or underscores, hyphens and other \"safe\" characters) for compound file names like <span style=\"font-family: monospace, monospace;\">MyJobResume.pdf</span>.\n\n[[Microblogging]] and [[social networking]] sites that limit the number of characters in a message are potential outlets for medial capitals. Using camel case between words reduces the number of spaces, and thus the number of characters, in a given message, allowing more content to fit into the limited space. [[Hashtag]]s, especially long ones, often use camel case to maintain readability (e.g. #CollegeStudentProblems is easier to read than #collegestudentproblems).\n\nIn website URLs, spaces are [[Percent-encoding|percent-encoded]] as \"%20\", making the address longer and less [[human readable]].

The use of eye-tracking equipment gives additional insight and overcomes some limitations of traditional data gathering techniques. Similarities and differences between the two studies are discussed.

Most are [[annual plant]]s; consequently one planting yields one harvest. Wheat, rye, triticale, oats, barley, and spelt are the \"cool-season\" cereals.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} These are hardy plants that grow well in moderate weather and cease to grow in hot weather (approximately {{convert|30|\u00b0C|disp=sqbr}}, but this varies by species and variety). The \"warm-season\" cereals are tender and prefer hot weather. Barley and rye are the hardiest cereals, able to overwinter in the [[subarctic]] and [[Siberia]]. Many cool-season cereals are grown in the tropics. However, some are only grown in cooler highlands, where it may be possible to grow multiple crops per year.\n\nFor the past few decades, there has also been increasing interest in [[perennial]] grain plants. This interest developed due to advantages in erosion control, reduced need for fertiliser, and potential lowered costs to the farmer. Though research is still in early stages, [[The Land Institute]] in Salina, Kansas has been able to create a few cultivars that produce a fairly good crop yield.<ref>Kunzig, Robert (April 2011) [http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text The Big Idea: Perennial Grains] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005202205/http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/04/big-idea/perennial-grains-text |date=5 October 2011 }}. National Geographic.</ref>\n\n===Planting===\n[[File:Dinr\u00eayes.jpg|thumb|Cereal [[grain]] seeds from left to right, top to bottom: [[wheat]], [[spelt]], [[barley]], [[oat]].]]\nThe warm-season cereals are grown in tropical lowlands year-round and in temperate climates during the frost-free season. Rice is commonly grown in flooded fields, though some strains are grown on dry land. Other warm climate cereals, such as [[sorghum]], are adapted to arid conditions.\n\nCool-season cereals are well-adapted to temperate climates. Most varieties of a particular species are either '''winter''' or '''spring''' types. Winter varieties are sown in the autumn, germinate and grow vegetatively, then become [[dormancy|dormant]] during winter. They resume growing in the springtime and mature in late spring or early summer. This cultivation system makes optimal use of water and frees the land for another crop early in the growing season.\n\nWinter varieties do not flower until springtime because they require [[vernalization]]: exposure to low temperatures for a genetically determined length of time. Where winters are too warm for vernalization or exceed the hardiness of the crop (which varies by species and variety), farmers grow spring varieties. Spring cereals are planted in early springtime and mature later that same summer, without vernalization. Spring cereals typically require more irrigation and yield less than winter cereals.\n\n===Harvesting===\n[[File:3-piantagione, Taccuino Sanitatis, Casanatense 4182.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Threshing; ''Tacuinum Sanitatis'', 14th century]]\nOnce the cereal plants have grown their seeds, they have completed their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The plants die, become brown, and dry. As soon as the parent plants and their seed kernels are reasonably dry, harvest can begin.\n\nIn developed countries, cereal crops are universally machine-harvested, typically using a [[combine harvester]], which cuts, [[threshing|threshes]], and [[winnowing|winnows]] the grain during a single pass across the field. In developing countries, a variety of harvesting methods are in use, depending on the cost of labor, from combines to hand tools such as the [[scythe]] or [[grain cradle]].\n\nIf a crop is harvested during humid weather, the grain may not dry adequately in the field to prevent spoilage during its storage. In this case, the grain is sent to a dehydrating facility, where artificial heat dries it.\n\nIn North America, farmers commonly deliver their newly harvested grain to a [[grain elevator]], a large storage facility that consolidates the crops of many farmers. The farmer may sell the grain at the time of delivery or maintain ownership of a share of grain in the pool for later sale. Storage facilities should be protected from small grain pests, rodents and birds.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:MaizeYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide maize production]]\n[[File:RiceYield.png|thumb|right|Worldwide rice production]]\n[[File:WheatYield.png|thumb|right|A map of worldwide wheat production.]]\nThe following table shows the annual production of cereals in 1961,<ref>1961 is the earliest year for which [[FAO]] statistics are available.</ref> 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 ranked by 2013 production.<ref name=\"prodstat\">{{cite web | url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | title=ProdSTAT | work=FAOSTAT | accessdate=26 December 2006 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65Ju02KCI?url=http://faostat.fao.org/site/567/DesktopDefault.aspx | archivedate=9 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n{| valign=\"top\" | class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 | Grain\n! colspan=5 nowrap | Worldwide production <br /> (millions of metric tons)\n! rowspan=2 | Notes\n|-\n! 1961 !! 2010 !! 2011 !! 2012 !! 2013 \n|-\n| [[Maize]] (corn)\n| align=\"center\" | 205 \n| align=\"center\" | 851\n| align=\"center\" | 888\n| align=\"center\" | 872\n| align=\"center\" | 1016\n| A staple food of people in the Americas, Africa, and of [[livestock]] worldwide; often called corn in North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

The clergy, like Plato's guardians, were placed in authority... by their talent as shown in ecclesiastical studies and administration, by their disposition to a life of meditation and simplicity, and ... by the influence of their relatives with the powers of state and church.

Known as the [[Western Schism]], western Christendom was a split between three men, who were driven by politics rather than any real theological disagreement for simultaneously claiming to be the true pope. The [[Avignon Papacy]] developed a reputation of corruption that estranged major parts of Western Christendom. The Avignon schism was ended by the [[Council of Constance]].<ref>Stump, P. H. (1994). The reforms of the Council of Constance, 1414-1418. Leiden: E.J. Brill</ref>\n\nBefore the modern period, Christendom was in a general crisis at the time of the [[Renaissance Papacy|Renaissance Popes]] because of the moral laxity of these pontiffs and their willingness to seek and rely on temporal power as secular rulers did.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Many in the Catholic Church's hierarchy in the Renaissance became increasingly entangled with insatiable greed for material wealth and temporal power, which led to many reform movements, some merely wanting a moral reformation of the Church's clergy, while others repudiated the Church and separated from it in order to form new sects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} The [[Italian Renaissance]] produced ideas or institutions by which men living in society could be held together in harmony. In the early 16th century, [[Baldassare Castiglione]] (The [[Book of the Courtier]]) laid out his vision of the ideal gentleman and lady, while [[Machiavelli]] cast a jaundiced eye on \"la verit\u00e0 effetuale delle cose\" \u2014 the actual truth of things \u2014 in ''[[The Prince]]'', composed, humanist style, chiefly of parallel ancient and modern examples of [[Virt\u00f9]]. Some Protestant movements grew up along lines of [[mysticism]] or [[renaissance humanism]] ([[cf.]] [[Erasmus]]). The Catholic Church fell partly into general neglect under the Renaissance Popes, whose inability to govern the Church by showing personal example of high moral standards set the climate for what would ultimately become the Protestant Reformation.<ref>The Cambridge Modern History. Vol 2: [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d=62407231 The Reformation (1903)].</ref> During the Renaissance the papacy was mainly run by the wealthy families and also had strong secular interests. To safeguard Rome and the connected Papal States the popes became necessarily involved in temporal matters, even leading armies, as the great patron of arts [[Pope Julius II]] did. It during these intermediate times popes strove to make Rome the capital of Christendom while projecting it, through art, architecture, and literature, as the center of a Golden Age of unity, order, and peace.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/pape/hd_pape.htm|title = The Papacy during the Renaissance|last = Norris |first =  Michael|date = August 2007|website = The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate= 11 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nProfessor Frederick J. McGinness described Rome as essential in understanding the legacy the Church and its representatives encapsulated best by [[Rome|The Eternal City]]: <blockquote>No other city in Europe matches Rome in its traditions, history, legacies, and influence in the Western world. Rome in the Renaissance under the papacy not only acted as guardian and transmitter of these elements stemming from the Roman Empire but also assumed the role as artificer and interpreter of its myths and meanings for the peoples of Europe from the Middle Ages to modern times... Under the patronage of the popes, whose wealth and income were exceeded only by their ambitions, the city became a cultural center for master architects, sculptors, musicians, painters, and artisans of every kind...In its myth and message, Rome had become the sacred city of the popes, the prime symbol of a triumphant Catholicism, the center of orthodox Christianity, a new Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0053.xml|title = Papal Rome|last = McGinness|first =  Frederick|date = 26 August 2011|website = Oxford Bibliographies|accessdate= 11 December 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is clearly noticeable that the popes of the Italian Renaissance have been subjected by many writers with an overly harsh tone.

An unformulated conception, the prerational ethics of private privilege and national unity, fills the background of men's minds. It represents feudal traditions rather than the tendency really involved in contemporary industry, science, or philanthropy. Those dark ages, from which our political practice is derived, had a political theory which we should do well to study; for their theory about a universal empire and a catholic church was in turn the echo of a former age of reason, when a few men conscious of ruling the world had for a moment sought to survey it as a whole and to rule it justly.<ref name=\"Santayana\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Reformation and Early Modern era===\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}\n{{further|Reformation|Counter-Reformation|History of Protestantism|European wars of religion}}\n{{further|Ottoman wars in Europe|History of the Russo-Turkish wars|History of the Serbian\u2013Turkish wars}}\n{{further|Jesuit China missions|Spanish missions in the Americas}}\nDevelopments in western philosophy and European events brought change to the notion of the ''Corpus Christianum''.

In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555 officially ended the idea among secular leaders that all Christians must be united under one church. The principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'' (\"whose the region is, his religion\") established the religious, political and geographic divisions of Christianity, and this was established with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] in 1648, which legally ended the concept of a single Christian hegemony in the territories of the Holy Roman Empire, despite the Catholic Church's doctrine that it alone is the one true Church founded by Christ.\nSubsequently, each government determined the religion of their own state.

This constitutes a huge body of extremely varied writing. [[Christian poetry]] is any [[poetry]] that contains [[Christianity|Christian]] teachings, themes, or references. The influence of Christianity on poetry has been great in any area that Christianity has taken hold. Christian poems often directly reference the [[Bible]], while others provide [[allegory]].\n\n====Supplemental arts====\n{{Main|Christian art}}\n[[Christian art]] is art produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of Christianity. Virtually all Christian groupings use or have used art to some extent. The prominence of art and the media, style, and representations change; however, the unifying theme is ultimately the representation of the life and times of [[Jesus]] and in some cases the [[Old Testament]]. Depictions of saints are also common, especially in [[Anglicanism]], [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]].\n\n====Illumination====\n{{Main|Illuminated manuscript}}\n\n[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|Picture of [[Christ in Majesty]] contained in an illuminated manuscript.]]\nAn [[illuminated manuscript]] is a [[manuscript]] in which the [[Writing|text]] is supplemented by the addition of decoration. The earliest surviving substantive illuminated manuscripts are from the period AD 400 to 600, primarily produced in Ireland, [[Constantinople]] and Italy. The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the [[Middle Ages]], although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the 15th century [[Renaissance]], along with a very limited number from [[Late Antiquity]].\n\nMost illuminated manuscripts were created as [[codex|codices]], which had superseded scrolls; some isolated single sheets survive. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on [[papyrus]]. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on [[parchment]] (most commonly of [[calfskin|calf]], sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called [[vellum]], traditionally made of unsplit [[calfskin]], though high quality parchment from other skins was also called ''parchment''.\n\n====Iconography====\n{{Main|Iconoclasm|Religious image|Christian icons|Christian symbolism}}\n[[File:St. Theodor.jpg|thumb|There are few old ceramic icons, such as this [[St. Theodor]] icon which dates to ca. 900 (from [[Preslav]], [[Bulgaria]]).]]\nChristian art began, about two centuries after Christ, by borrowing motifs from Roman Imperial imagery, classical Greek and Roman religion and popular art. [[Religious images]] are used to some extent by the [[Abrahamic religion|Abrahamic]] Christian faith, and often contain highly complex iconography, which reflects centuries of accumulated tradition. In the [[Late Antique]] period iconography began to be standardised, and to relate more closely to [[Biblical]] texts, although many gaps in the [[canonical Gospel]] narratives were plugged with matter from the [[apocrypha|apocryphal gospels]]. Eventually the Church would succeed in weeding most of these out, but some remain, like the ox and ass in the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]].\n\nAn [[icon]] is a religious work of art, most commonly a painting, from [[Eastern Christianity]]. Christianity has used [[Christian symbolism|symbolism]] from its very beginnings.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Symbolism}}</ref> In both East and West, numerous iconic types of [[Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and saints and other subjects were developed; the number of named types of icons of Mary, with or without the infant Christ, was especially large in the East, whereas [[Christ Pantocrator]] was much the commonest image of Christ.\n\n[[Christian symbolism]] invests objects or actions with an inner meaning expressing Christian ideas. [[Christianity]] has borrowed from the common stock of significant symbols known to most periods and to all regions of the world. [[Religious symbolism]] is effective when it appeals to both the intellect and the emotions. Especially important depictions of Mary include the [[Hodegetria]] and [[Panagia]] types. Traditional models evolved for narrative paintings, including large cycles covering the events of the Life of Christ, the [[Life of the Virgin]], parts of the Old Testament, and, increasingly, the lives of popular [[saint]]s. Especially in the West, a system of [[emblem|attributes]] developed for [[Saint symbology|identifying individual]] figures of saints by a standard appearance and symbolic objects held by them; in the East they were more likely to identified by text labels.\n\nEach [[saint]] has a story and a reason why he or she led an exemplary life. Symbols have been used to tell these stories throughout the history of the Church. A number of Christian [[saint]]s are traditionally represented by a symbol or [[Icon|iconic motif]] associated with their life, termed an attribute or [[emblem]], in order to identify them. The study of these forms part of [[iconography]] in [[Art history]]. They were particularly\n\n{{See also|Saint symbology|Iconography}}\n\n====Architecture====\n{{Main|Church architecture}}\n\n[[File:Gotic3d2.jpg|thumb|The structure of a typical Gothic cathedral.]]\n[[Christian architecture]] encompasses a wide range of both secular and religious styles from the foundation of Christianity to the present day, influencing the design and construction of buildings and structures in Christian culture.\n\nBuildings were at first adapted from those originally intended for other purposes but, with the rise of distinctively ecclesiastical architecture, church buildings came to influence secular ones which have often imitated religious architecture. In the 20th century, the use of new materials, such as concrete, as well as simpler styles has had its effect upon the design of churches and arguably the flow of influence has been reversed. From the birth of Christianity to the present, the most significant period of transformation for Christian architecture in the west was the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic cathedral]]. In the east, [[Byzantine architecture]] was a continuation of [[Roman architecture]].\n\n=== Philosophy ===\n{{Main|Christian philosophy|Scholasticism}}\n\n[[Christian philosophy]] is a term to describe the fusion of various fields of [[philosophy]] with the [[Theology|theological]] doctrines of Christianity. [[Scholasticism]], which means \"that [which] belongs to the school\", and was a method of learning taught by the [[academics]] (or ''school people'') of medieval [[university|universities]] c. 1100\u20131500. Scholasticism originally started to reconcile the [[philosophy]] of the ancient classical philosophers with medieval Christian theology. Scholasticism is not a philosophy or theology in itself but a tool and method for learning which places emphasis on [[dialectical reasoning]].\n{{Further|Christian apologetics|History of science in the Middle Ages}}\n\n==Christian civilization==\n{{Off topic|date=January 2018|Christianity and science}}\n{{Main|Christianity and science}}\n[[File:God the Geometer.jpg|thumb|[[Science]], and particularly [[geometry]] and [[astronomy]], was linked directly to the divine for most medieval scholars. Since these Christians believed God imbued the universe with regular geometric and harmonic principles, to seek these principles was therefore to seek and worship God.]]\n\n=== Medieval conditions ===\n{{Main|Medieval science|Medieval technology|List of Christian thinkers in science}}\nThe [[Byzantine Empire]], which was the most sophisticated culture during antiquity, suffered under [[Muslim conquests]] limiting its scientific prowess during the Medieval period. Christian [[Western Europe]] had suffered a catastrophic loss of knowledge following the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. But thanks to the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] scholars such as [[Aquinas]] and [[Buridan]], the West carried on at least the spirit of scientific inquiry which would later lead to Europe's taking the lead in science during the [[Scientific Revolution]] using [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translations of medieval works]].\n\n[[Medieval technology]] refers to the technology used in medieval Europe under Christian rule. After the [[Renaissance of the 12th century]], medieval Europe saw a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth.<ref>Alfred Crosby described some of this technological revolution in his ''The Measure of Reality : Quantification in Western Europe, 1250\u20131600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.</ref> The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption of [[gunpowder]] and the [[astrolabe]], the invention of [[spectacles]], and greatly improved [[water mill]]s, building techniques, [[agriculture]] in general, [[clock]]s, and [[ship]]s. The latter advances made possible the dawn of the [[Age of Exploration]]. The development of water mills was impressive, and extended from agriculture to [[sawmill]]s both for timber and stone, probably derived from [[Roman technology]]. By the time of the [[Domesday Book]], most large villages in [[Great Britain|Britain]] had mills. They also were widely used in [[mining]], as described by [[Georg Agricola]] in [[De Re Metallica]] for raising ore from shafts, crushing ore, and even powering [[bellows]].\n\nSignificant in this respect were advances within the fields of [[navigation]]. The [[compass]] and [[astrolabe]] along with advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the [[Ocean|World Oceans]] and thus domination of the worlds economic trade. [[Johann Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]\u2019s [[printing press]] made possible a dissemination of knowledge to a wider population, that would not only lead to a gradually more egalitarian society, but one more able to dominate other cultures, drawing from a vast reserve of knowledge and experience.\n\n===Renaissance innovations===\n{{Main|History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance technology}}\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], great advances occurred in geography, astronomy, chemistry, physics, math, manufacturing, and engineering. The rediscovery of ancient scientific texts was accelerated after the Fall of Constantinople, and the invention of [[printing]] which would democratize learning and allow a faster propagation of new ideas. ''[[Renaissance technology]]'' is the set of artifacts and customs, spanning roughly the 14th through the 16th century. The era is marked by such profound technical advancements like the [[printing press]], [[Perspective (graphical)|linear perspectivity]], [[patent law]], [[Santa Maria del Fiore|double shell domes]] or [[Bastion fortress]]es. Draw-books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as [[Taccola]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.\n\n[[History of science in the Renaissance|Renaissance science]] spawned the [[Scientific Revolution]]; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement. The ''Scientific Renaissance'' was the early phase of the Scientific Revolution. In the two-phase model of [[early modern]] science: a ''Scientific Renaissance'' of the 15th and 16th centuries, focused on the restoration of the natural knowledge of the ancients; and a ''Scientific Revolution'' of the 17th century, when scientists shifted from recovery to innovation.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Christianity by country}}{{See also|List of Christian denominations by number of members|Christian population growth}}\n\n===Geographic spread===\n[[File:Christ Islam.png|thumb|upright=1.8|Relative geographic prevalence of Christianity versus [[Islam]] versus lack of either religion (2006).]]\nIn 2009, according to the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Christianity was the majority religion in Europe (including Russia) with 80%, [[Latin America]] with 92%, [[North America]] with 81%, and [[Oceania]] with 79%.<ref>{{Cite book |date=2010 |title=Britannica Book of the Year 2010 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeKbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA300 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. |page=300 |isbn=9781615353668 |accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> There are also large Christian communities in other parts of the world, such as China, India and [[Central Asia]], where Christianity is the second-largest religion after [[Islam]].

In contrast, the term [[Holy Orders]] is used by many Christian churches to refer to ordination or to a group of individuals who are set apart for a special role or ministry. Historically, the word \"order\" designated an established civil body or corporation with a hierarchy, and ordinatio meant legal incorporation into an ordo. The word \"holy\" refers to the Church. In context, therefore, a holy order is set apart for ministry in the Church. Religious orders are composed of initiates (laity) and, in some traditions, ordained clergies.\n\nVarious organizations include:\n* In the Roman Catholic Church, [[religious institute]]s and [[secular institute]]s are the major forms of [[institute of consecrated life|institutes of consecrated life]], similar to which are [[society of apostolic life|societies of apostolic life]]. They are organisations of laity and/or clergy who live a common life under the guidance of a fixed rule and the leadership of a superior. (ed., see [[:Category:Catholic orders and societies]] for a particular listing.)\n* [[Anglican religious order]]s are communities of laity and/or clergy in the Anglican churches who live under a common rule of life. (ed., see [[:Category:Anglican organizations]] for a particular listing)\n{{See also|Category:Christian organizations}}\n\n==Christianity law and ethics==\n\n===Church and state framing===\n{{Main|Canon law|Christian ethics}}\nWithin the framework of Christianity, there are at least three possible definitions for Church law. One is the Torah/Mosaic Law (from what Christians consider to be the [[Old Testament]]) also called [[Divine Law]] or [[Biblical law]]. Another is the instructions of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] in the [[Gospel]] (sometimes referred to as [[the Law of Christ]] or the [[New Commandment]] or the [[New Covenant]]). A third is [[canon law]] which is the internal [[ecclesiastical]] law governing the [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] churches, and the [[Anglicanism|Anglican Communion]] of churches.<ref>{{CathEncy|wstitle=Canon law}}</ref> The way that such church law is [[legislative power|legislated]], interpreted and at times [[court|adjudicated]] varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a [[ecumenical council|council]] (From Greek ''kanon'' / \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd, [[Hebrew]] kaneh / \u05e7\u05e0\u05d4, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.\n\n[[Christian ethics]] in general has tended to stress the need for [[divine grace|grace]], [[mercy]], and [[forgiveness]] because of human weakness and developed while [[Early Christians]] were subjects of the [[Roman Empire]]. From the time Nero blamed Christians for setting Rome ablaze (64 AD) until Galarius (311 AD), persecutions against Christians erupted periodically. Consequently, Early Christian ethics included discussions of how believers should relate to Roman authority and to the empire.\n\nUnder the [[Constantine I and Christianity|Emperor Constantine I]] (312-337), Christianity became a legal religion. While some scholars debate whether Constantine's conversion to Christianity was authentic or simply matter of political expediency, [[Edict of Milan|Constantine's decree]] made the empire safe for Christian practice and belief. Consequently, issues of Christian doctrine, ethics and church practice were debated openly, see for example the [[First Council of Nicaea]] and the [[First seven Ecumenical Councils]]. By the time of [[Theodosius I]] (379-395), Christianity had become the [[state religion]] of the empire. With Christianity in power, ethical concerns broaden and included discussions of the proper role of the state.\n\n[[Render unto Caesar\u2026]] is the beginning of a phrase attributed to Jesus in the [[synoptic gospel]]s which reads in full, \"''Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s, and unto God the things that are God\u2019s''\". This phrase has become a widely quoted summary of the relationship between Christianity and secular authority. The gospels say that when Jesus gave his response, his interrogators \"marvelled, and left him, and went their way.\" Time has not resolved an ambiguity in this phrase, and people continue to interpret this passage to support various positions that are poles apart. The traditional division, carefully determined, in Christian thought is the [[Sovereign state|state]] and [[Christian Church|church]] have separate [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]].\n\n[[Thomas Aquinas]] thoroughly discussed that ''human law'' is [[positive law]] which means that it is [[natural law]] applied by governments to societies. All human laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law was in a sense no law at all. At this point, the natural law was not only used to pass judgment on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what the law said in the first place. This could result in some tension.<ref>Burns, \"Aquinas's Two Doctrines of Natural Law.\"</ref> Late ecclesiastical writers followed in his footsteps.\n\n{{See also|Doctrine of the two kingdoms|Unam sanctam}}\n\n====Democratic ideology====\n{{Main|Christian democracy}}\n[[Christian democracy]] is a political ideology that seeks to apply Christian principles to public policy. It emerged in 19th-century Europe, largely under the influence of [[Catholic social teaching]]. In a number of countries, the democracy's Christian ethos has been diluted by [[secularisation]]. In practice, Christian democracy is often considered [[social conservatism|conservative]] on cultural, social and moral issues and [[progressivism|progressive]] on fiscal and economic issues. In places, where their opponents have traditionally been secularist [[socialism|socialists]] and [[social democracy|social democrats]], Christian democratic parties are moderately [[conservatism|conservative]], whereas in other cultural and political environments they can lean to the left.\n\n===Women's roles===\n{{Main|Women in Christianity}}\nAttitudes and beliefs about the roles and responsibilities of [[women in Christianity]] vary considerably today as they have throughout the last two millennia \u2014 evolving along with or counter to the societies in which Christians have lived. The Bible and Christianity historically have been interpreted as excluding women from church leadership and placing them in submissive roles in marriage. Male leadership has been assumed in the church and within marriage, society and government.<ref name=\"Blevins\">Blevins, Carolyn DeArmond, ''Women in Christian History: A Bibliography.'' Macon, Georgia: Mercer Univ Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-86554-493-X}}</ref>\n\nSome contemporary writers describe the role of women in the life of the church as having been downplayed, overlooked, or denied throughout much of Christian history. [[Paradigm shift]]s in gender roles in society and also many churches has inspired reevaluation by many Christians of some long-held attitudes to the contrary. [[Christian egalitarianism|Christian egalitarians]] have increasingly argued for equal roles for men and women in [[Christian views of marriage|marriage]], as well as for the [[ordination of women]] to the [[clergy]]. Contemporary conservatives meanwhile have reasserted what has been termed a \"[[Complementarianism|complementarian]]\" position, promoting the traditional belief that the [[Bible]] ordains different roles and responsibilities for women and men in the Church and family.\n\n==Major Christian denominations==\n{{Importance section|date=January 2018}}\n{{Main|List of Christian denominations}}\n\n{|align=right\n|[[File:Christianity major branches.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|A schematic of Christian denominational taxonomy.

Both the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox churches would consider themselves in unbroken continuity with the \"early Christianity\" line.]]\n|-\n|[[File:Protestant branches.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|Major branches and movements within Protestantism]]\n|}\nA [[Christian denomination]] is a distinct [[religion|religious]] body within [[Christianity]], identified by traits such as a name, organisation, leadership and doctrine. Worldwide, Christians are divided, often along ethnic and linguistic lines, into separate churches and traditions. Technically, divisions between one group and another are defined by [[Ecclesiology|church doctrine]] and [[church authority]]. Centering on language of ''professed Christianity'' and ''true Christianity'', issues that separate one group of followers of [[Jesus]] from another include:\n* [[Apostolic succession]],\n* [[Biblical authority]],\n* [[Biblical criticism]],\n* [[Biblical inerrancy]],\n* [[Biblical infallibility]],\n* [[Biblical inspiration]],\n* [[Biblical interpretation]],\n* [[Papal primacy]], and\n* [[christian views of Jesus|Views of Jesus]] ([[Christology]]).\n\nChristianity is composed of, but not limited to, five major branches of Churches: [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Eastern Orthodox]]y, [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], [[Anglicanism]], and [[Protestantism]]. Some listings include Anglicans among Protestants while others list the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox together as one group, thus the number of distinct major branches can vary between three and five depending on the listing. The [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (Nestorians) and the Old Catholic churches are also distinct Christian bodies of historic importance, but much smaller in adherents and geographic scope. Each of the branches has important subdivisions. Because the Protestant subdivisions do not maintain a common theology or earthly leadership, they are far more distinct than the subdivisions of the other four groupings. ''Denomination'' typically refers to one of the many Christian groupings including each of the multitude of Protestant subdivisions.\n\n{{See also|East\u2013West Schism|History of the East\u2013West Schism|History of the Roman Catholic Church|History of the Eastern Orthodox Church|History of Protestantism|History of the Anglican Communion|History of Oriental Orthodoxy}}\n\n===Sizes of denomination===\n{{See also|List of Christian denominations by number of members}}\nIn Christendom, the largest denominations are:\n# [[Roman Catholicism]]&nbsp;\u2013 1.3 billion\n# [[Protestantism]]&nbsp;\u2013 540 million\n# [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]&nbsp;\u2013 300 million\n# [[Anglicanism]]&nbsp;\u2013 115 million\n# [[Oriental Orthodoxy]]&nbsp;\u2013 75 million\n# [[Nontrinitarianism]]&nbsp;\u2013 26 million\n# [[Nestorianism]]&nbsp;\u2013 1 million\n# [[Old Catholicism]]&nbsp;\u2013 0.4 million\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Caesaropapism]]\n* [[Holy Roman Emperor]]\n* [[Christian republic]]\n* [[Constantine the Great and Christianity]]\n* [[Constantinian shift]]\n* [[Dominionism]]\n* [[Ecumenism]] ([[Catholic Church and ecumenism]])\n* ''[[Res publica christiana]]''\n* [[Role of Christianity in civilization]]\n* ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]''\n* [[Union of Christendom]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n<!-- Books are listed by date; most recent first, oldest last -->\n;20th century sources\n{{colbegin}}\n* {{cite book| title = The Return of Christendom| url = https://books.google.com/?id=vlEAAAAAMAAJ| year = 1922| publisher = Macmillan }}\n* {{cite book| author = Andrew Dickson White| title = A History of the warfare of science with theology in Christendom| url = https://books.google.com/?id=L6wFAAAAIAAJ| year = 1897| publisher = D.

It is smaller than its close relative, the [[gray wolf]], and slightly smaller than the closely related [[eastern wolf]] and [[red wolf]]. It fills much of the same [[ecological niche]] as the [[golden jackal]] does in Eurasia, though it is larger and more predatory, and is sometimes called the ''American jackal'' by zoologists.\n\nThe coyote is listed as [[Least Concern|least concern]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] due to its wide distribution and abundance throughout North America, southwards through [[Mexico]], and into [[Central America]]. The species is versatile, able to adapt to and expand into environments modified by humans. It is enlarging its range, with coyotes moving into urban areas in the Eastern U.S., and was sighted in eastern Panama (across the [[Panama Canal]] from their home range) for the first time in 2013.\n\n{{As of|2005}}, 19 coyote [[subspecies]] are recognized. The average male weighs {{convert|8|to|20|kg|lbs|abbr=on}} and the average female {{convert|7|to|18|kg|lbs|abbr=on}}. Their fur color is predominantly light gray and red or [[fulvous]] interspersed with black and white, though it varies somewhat with geography. It is highly flexible in social organization, living either in a family unit or in loosely knit packs of unrelated individuals. It has a varied diet consisting primarily of animal meat, including [[deer]], [[rabbit]]s, [[hare]]s, [[rodent]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[fish]], and [[invertebrate]]s, though it may also eat fruits and vegetables on occasion. Its characteristic vocalization is a howl made by solitary individuals. Humans are the coyote's greatest threat, followed by [[North American cougar|cougar]]s and gray wolves. In spite of this, coyotes sometimes mate with gray, eastern, or red wolves, producing \"[[coywolf]]\" hybrids. In the northeastern United States and eastern Canada, the [[eastern coyote]] (a larger subspecies, though still smaller than wolves) is the result of various historical and recent matings with various types of wolves. Genetic studies show that most North American wolves contain some level of coyote DNA.\n\nThe coyote is a prominent character in [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] folklore, mainly in the [[Southwestern United States]] and Mexico, usually depicted as a [[trickster]] that alternately assumes the form of an actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in [[Mesoamerica]]n [[cosmology]] as a symbol of military might. After the [[European colonization of the Americas]], it was reviled in [[Anglo-America]]n culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Coyote portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Closeup of a mountain coyote's (''C.{{nbsp}}l. lestes'') head]]\n\nCoyote males average {{convert|8|to|20|kg|abbr=on}} in weight, while females average {{convert|7|to|18|kg|abbr=on}}, though size varies geographically.

By the [[Pliocene]] (5{{nbsp}}Mya), the larger ''[[Canis lepophagus]]''<ref name=fossilworks1/> appeared in the same region and by the [[early Pleistocene]] (1{{nbsp}}Mya) ''C.{{nbsp}}latrans'' (the coyote) was in existence. They proposed that the progression from ''Eucyon davisi'' to ''C{{nbsp}}lepophagus'' to the coyote was linear evolution.<ref name=wang2008/>{{rp|p58}} Additionally, ''C.{{nbsp}}latrans'' and ''C.{{nbsp}} aureus'' are closely related to ''[[Canis edwardii|C.{{nbsp}}edwardii]]'', a species that appeared earliest spanning the mid-[[Blancan]] ([[late Pliocene]]) to the close of the [[Irvingtonian]] (late Pleistocene), and coyote remains indistinguishable from ''C.{{nbsp}}latrans'' were contemporaneous with ''C.{{nbsp}}edwardii'' in North America.<ref name=tedford2009/>{{rp|p175,180}} Johnston describes ''C.{{nbsp}}lepophagus'' as having a more slender skull and skeleton than the modern coyote.<ref name=johnston1938/>{{rp|385}} Ronald Nowak found that the early populations had small, delicate, narrowly proportioned skulls that resemble small coyotes and appear to be ancestral to ''C.{{nbsp}}latrans''.<ref name=nowak2003/>{{rp|p241}}\n\n''C. lepophagus'' was similar in weight to modern coyotes, but had shorter limb bones that indicates a less [[cursorial]] lifestyle. The coyote represents a more primitive form of ''Canis'' than the gray wolf, as shown by its relatively small size and its comparatively narrow skull and jaws, which lack the grasping power necessary to hold the large prey in which wolves specialize. This is further corroborated by the coyote's [[sagittal crest]], which is low or totally flattened, thus indicating a weaker bite than the wolf's. The coyote is not a specialized carnivore as the wolf is, as shown by the larger chewing surfaces on the [[molar (tooth)|molars]], reflecting the species' relative dependence on vegetable matter. In these respects, the coyote resembles the fox-like progenitors of the genus more so than the wolf.<ref name=nowak1978/>\n\nThe oldest fossils that fall within the range of the modern coyote date to 0.74\u20130.85 [[Megaannum|Ma]] (million years) in Hamilton Cave, West Virginia; 0.73 Ma in Irvington, California; 0.35\u20130.48 Ma in Porcupine Cave, Colorado and in Cumberland Cave, Pennsylvania.<ref name=tedford2009/>{{rp|p136}} Modern coyotes arose 1,000 years after the [[Quaternary extinction event]].<ref name=\"meachen2012\"/> Compared to their modern [[Holocene]] counterparts, [[Pleistocene coyote]]s (''C.{{nbsp}}l. orcutti'') were larger and more robust, likely in response to larger [[Competition (biology)|competitors]] and prey.<ref name=\"meachen2012\">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1113788109|pmid=22371581| title = Evolution in coyotes (''Canis latrans'') in response to the megafaunal extinctions| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 109| issue = 11| pages = 4191\u20136| year = 2012| last1 = Meachen | first1 = J.

The study also indicated that all North American wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the red wolf and eastern wolf are highly [[Genetic admixture|admixed]] with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000 and 117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present. Other tests and modelling showed various divergence ranges and the conclusion was a range of less than 6,000 and 117,000 years before present. The study found that coyote ancestry was highest in red wolves from the southeastern United States and lowest among the Great Lakes region wolves. The theory proposed was that this pattern matched the south to north disappearance of the wolf due to European colonization and its resulting loss of habitat. Bounties led to the extirpation of wolves initially in the southeast, and as the wolf population declined, wolf-coyote admixture increased. Later, this process occurred in the Great Lakes region with the influx of coyotes replacing wolves, followed by the expansion of coyotes and their hybrids across the wider region.<ref name=vonholdt2016/><ref name=virginia2016/> The proposed timing of the wolf/coyote divergence conflicts with the finding of a coyote-like specimen in strata dated to 1 Mya.<ref name=wang2008/>\n\n===Subspecies===\n{{As of|2005}}, 19 subspecies are recognized.<ref name=bekoff2003>{{cite book|url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=-xQalfqP7BcC|page=467}}|editor-first=George A.|editor-last=Feldhamer |editor2-first=Bruce C.|editor2-last=Thompson|editor3-first=Joseph A.|editor3-last=Chapman|first=Marc|last=Bekoff|first2=Eric M.|last2=Gese|chapter=Coyote|year=2003|title=Wild Mammals of North America: Biology, Management, and Conservation|edition=2nd|location=Baltimore, Maryland|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|pages=467\u2013470|isbn=978-0-8018-7416-1|oclc=51969059}}</ref><ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Wozencraft|id=14000718}}</ref> Geographic variation in coyotes is not great, though taken as a whole, the eastern subspecies (''C. l. thamnos'' and ''C. l. frustor'') are large, dark-colored animals, with a gradual paling in color and reduction in size westward and northward (''C. l. texensis'', ''C. l. latrans'', ''C. l. lestes'', and ''C. l. incolatus''), a brightening of [[ochre|ochraceous]] tones\u2013deep orange or brown\u2013towards the Pacific coast (''C. l. ochropus'', ''C. l. umpquensis''), a reduction in size in the Southwestern United States (''C. l. microdon'', ''C. l. mearnsi'') and a general trend towards dark reddish colors and short muzzles in Mexican and Central American populations.<ref name=\"young249\">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|p=249}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"background:#115a6c;\"\n!Subspecies\n!Trinomial authority\n!Description\n!Range\n!Synonyms\n!Image\n|-\n|'''Plains coyote'''<br/>''[[Plains coyote|C. l. latrans]]''<br>[[nominate subspecies]]\n[[File:The Clever Coyote (1951) C. l. latrans \u2642.png|150 px]]\n|[[Thomas Say|Say]], 1823\n|The largest subspecies, it has rather pale fur and bears large molars and carnassials.<ref name=\"merriam1897\">{{cite journal|author=Merriam, C.

At least 11 different vocalizations are known in adult coyotes. These sounds are divided into three categories: agonistic and alarm, greeting, and contact. Vocalizations of the first category include woofs, growls, huffs, barks, bark howls, yelps, and high-frequency whines. Woofs are used as low-intensity threats or alarms, and are usually heard near den sites, prompting the pups to immediately retreat into their burrows. Growls are used as threats at short distances, but have also been heard among pups playing and copulating males. Huffs are high-intensity threat vocalizations produced by rapid expiration of air. Barks can be classed as both long-distance threat vocalizations and as alarm calls. Bark howls may serve similar functions. Yelps are emitted as a sign of submission, while high-frequency whines are produced by dominant animals acknowledging the submission of subordinates. Greeting vocalizations include low-frequency whines, 'wow-oo-wows', and group yip howls. Low-frequency whines are emitted by submissive animals, and are usually accompanied by tail wagging and muzzle nibbling. The sound known as 'wow-oo-wow' has been described as a \"greeting song\". The group yip howl is emitted when two or more pack members reunite, and may be the final act of a complex greeting ceremony. Contact calls include lone howls and group howls, as well as the previously mentioned group yip howls. The lone howl is the most iconic sound of the coyote, and may serve the purpose of announcing the presence of a lone individual separated from its pack. Group howls are used as both substitute group yip howls and as responses to either lone howls, group howls, or group yip howls.<ref name=\"lehner1978\">{{cite book|last=Lehner|first=Philip N.|year=1978|chapter=Coyote Communication|pages=127\u2013162|editor-first=M.|editor-last=Bekoff|title=Coyotes: Biology, Behavior, and Management|publisher=Academic Press| location=New York|isbn=978-1-930665-42-2|oclc=52626838}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Habitat===\n[[File:Urban Coyote, Bernal Heights.jpg|thumb|upright|Urban coyote in [[Bernal Heights]], [[San Francisco]]]]\nPrior to the near extermination of wolves and cougars, the coyote was most numerous in [[grassland]]s inhabited by [[American bison|bison]], [[pronghorn]], [[elk]], and other deer, doing particularly well in short-grass areas with [[prairie dog]]s, though it was just as much at home in semiarid areas with [[sagebrush]] and [[jackrabbit]]s or in deserts inhabited by [[cactus]], [[kangaroo rat]]s, and [[rattlesnake]]s.

From the 1890s, dense forests were transformed into agricultural land and wolf control implemented on a large scale, leaving a niche for coyotes to disperse into. There were two major dispersals from two populations of genetically distinct coyotes. The first major dispersal to the northeast came in the early twentieth century from those coyotes living in the northern Great Plains. These came to New England via northern Great Lakes region and southern Canada, and to Pennsylvania via the southern Great Lakes region, meeting together in the 1940s in New York and Pennsylvania. These coyotes have hybridized with the remnant gray wolf and Eastern wolf populations, which has added to coyote genetic diversity and may have assisted adaptation to the new niche. The second major dispersal to the southeast came in the mid-20th century from Texas and reached the Carolinas in the 1980s. These coyotes have hybridized with the remnant red wolf populations before the 1970s when the red wolf was extirpated in the wild, which has also added to coyote genetic diversity and may have assisted adaptation to the new niche. Both of these two major coyote dispersals have experienced rapid population growth and are forecast to meet along the mid-Atlantic coast. The study concludes that for coyotes the long range dispersal, gene flow from local populations, and rapid population growth may be inter-related.<ref name=heppenheimer2017/>\n\n==Diseases and parasites==\n[[File:Mangy coyote A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park.jpg|thumb|California valley coyote (''C. l. ochropus'') suffering from [[sarcoptic mange]]]]\nAmong large North American carnivores, the coyote probably carries the largest number of diseases and parasites, likely due to its wide range and varied diet.<ref name=\"young107\">{{Harvnb|Young|Jackson|1978|pp=107\u2013114}}</ref> [[Viral diseases]] known to infect coyotes include [[rabies]], [[canine distemper]], [[infectious canine hepatitis]], four strains of [[equine encephalitis (disambiguation)|equine encephalitis]], and [[Oral florid papillomatosis|oral papillomatosis]].

When attacking smaller prey, such as young lambs, the kill is made by biting the skull and spinal regions, causing massive tissue and bone damage. Small or young prey may be completely carried off, leaving only blood as evidence of a kill.

The character was created by writer [[Robert E. Howard]] in 1932 in a series of fantasy stories published in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine.\n\n==Publication history==\nConan the Barbarian was created by Robert E. Howard in a series of fantasy stories published in ''Weird Tales'' in 1932.<ref>Herron (1984). p. 149: \"Robert E. Howard of Cross Plains, Texas, created one of the great mythic figures in modern popular culture, the Dark Barbarian\u2026 [which] put Howard in the select ranks of the literary legend-makers\"</ref> For months, Howard had been in search of a new character to market to the burgeoning pulp outlets of the early 1930s. In October 1931, he submitted the short story \"People of the Dark\" to Clayton Publications' new magazine, ''[[Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror]]'' (June 1932). \"People of the Dark\" is a remembrance story of \"[[past lives]]\", and in its first-person narrative the protagonist describes one of his previous incarnations; Conan is a black-haired [[barbarian]] hero who swears by a deity called [[Crom (fictional deity)|Crom]]. Some Howard scholars believe this Conan to be a forerunner of the more famous character.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\">Louinet, pp. 429-453</ref>\n\nIn February 1932, Howard vacationed at a border town on the lower [[Rio Grande]]. During this trip, he further conceived the character of Conan and also wrote the poem \"[[Cimmeria (poem)|Cimmeria]]\", much of which echoes specific passages in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]]''.<ref>\"Hyborean Genesis: Notes on the Creation of the Conan Stories\", by Patrice Louinet; in [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTFV7Q5Nd4IC The Coming Of Conan The Cimmerian], by Robert Ervin Howard, Del Rey/Ballantine Books, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=mTFV7Q5Nd4IC&lpg=PA424&dq=howard%20conan%201932%20rio%20grande%20cimmeria&pg=PA424#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 424]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SRDUAAAAQBAJ Conversations with Texas Writers], by Frances Leonard and Ramona Cearley, University of Texas Press, 1 Jan 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRDUAAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT217&dq=howard%20conan%201932%20rio%20grande%20cimmeria&pg=PT217#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 217]</ref> According to some scholars, Howard's conception of Conan and the [[Hyborian Age]] may have originated in [[Thomas Bulfinch]]'s ''[[Thomas Bulfinch|The Outline of Mythology]]'' (1913) which inspired Howard to \"coalesce into a coherent whole his literary aspirations and the strong physical, autobiographical elements underlying the creation of Conan\".<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nHaving digested these prior influences after he returned from his trip, Howard rewrote a rejected story, \"[[By This Axe I Rule!]]\" (May 1929), replacing his existing character [[Kull of Atlantis]] with his new hero, and retitling it \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\". Howard also wrote \"[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]\", inspired by the [[Greek mythology|Greek myth]] of [[Daphne]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and submitted both stories to ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine. Although \"[[The Frost-Giant's Daughter]]\" was rejected, the magazine accepted \"The Phoenix on the Sword\" after it received the requested polishing.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\n\"The Phoenix on the Sword\" appeared in ''Weird Tales'' [[cover-date]]d December&nbsp;1932. Editor [[Farnsworth Wright]] subsequently prompted Howard to write an 8,000-word essay for personal use detailing \"the [[Hyborian Age]]\", the fictional setting for Conan. Using this essay as his guideline, Howard began plotting \"[[The Tower of the Elephant]]\", a new Conan story that was the first to truly integrate his new conception of the Hyborian world.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nThe publication and success of \"The Tower of the Elephant\" spurred Howard to write many more Conan stories for ''Weird Tales''. By the time of Howard's suicide in 1936, he had written 21&nbsp;complete stories, 17&nbsp;of&nbsp;which had been published, as well as a number of unfinished fragments.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nFollowing Howard's death, the copyright of the Conan stories passed through several hands. Eventually, under the guidance of [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], the stories were edited, revised, and sometimes rewritten. For roughly 40 years, the original versions of Howard's Conan stories remained out of print. In 1977, the publisher Berkley Books issued three volumes using the earliest published form of the texts from ''Weird Tales'',{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} but these failed to displace the edited versions. In the 1980s and 1990s, the copyright holders of the Conan franchise permitted Howard's stories to go out of print entirely,{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} while continuing to sell Conan works by other authors.\n\nIn 2000, the British publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]] issued a two-volume, complete edition of Howard's Conan stories as part of its Fantasy Masterworks imprint, which included several stories that had never seen print in their original form. The Gollancz edition mostly used the versions of the stories as published in ''Weird Tales''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://superherouniverse.com/wiki/Conan_the_Barbarian/|title=Conan the Barbarian - Superhero Wiki Encyclopedia|website=superherouniverse.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe two volumes were combined and the stories resorted into chronological order as ''The Complete Chronicles of Conan: Centenary Edition'' ([[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz Science Fiction]], 2006; edited and with an Afterword by Steve Jones).\n\nIn 2003, another British publisher, Wandering Star Books,<ref>[http://www.wanderingstarbooks.com/ Wandering Star Books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130718135237/http://wanderingstarbooks.com/ |date=2013-07-18 }}, official website</ref> made an effort both to restore Howard's original manuscripts and to provide a more scholarly and historical view of the Conan stories. It published hardcover editions in England, which were republished in the United States by the Del Rey imprint of [[Ballantine Books]]. The first book, ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume One (1932&ndash;1933)'' (2003; published in the US as ''[[The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian]]'') includes Howard's notes on his fictional setting, as well as letters and poems concerning the genesis of his ideas. This was followed by ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Two (1934)'' (2004; published in the US as ''[[The Bloody Crown of Conan]]'') and ''Conan of Cimmeria: Volume Three (1935&ndash;1936)'' (2005; published in the US as ''[[The Conquering Sword of Conan]]''). These three volumes combined include all of the original, unedited Conan stories.\n\n==Setting==\n{{main|Hyborian Age}}\n\nThe various stories of '''Conan the Barbarian''' occur in the pseudo-historical \"[[Hyborian Age]]\", set after the destruction of [[Atlantis]] and before the rise of any known [[Ancient history|ancient civilization]]. This is a specific epoch in a fictional timeline created by Howard for many of the [[low fantasy]] tales of his [[artificial mythology|artificial legendary]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525135846/http://hyboria.xoth.net/history/hyborian_age.htm | archivedate=25 May 2011|title=The Hyborian Age|author=Howard, Robert E., adapted by [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Walt Simonson]]|work=Conan Saga |issue= 50\u201354, 56|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|deadurl=no}}</ref>\n\nThe reasons behind the invention of the Hyborian Age were perhaps commercial: Howard had an intense love for history and historical dramas; however, at the same time, he recognized the difficulties and the time-consuming research work needed in maintaining historical accuracy\u2014and moreover, the poorly-stocked libraries in the rural part of Texas where Howard lived just didn't have the material needed for such historical research. By conceiving a timeless setting\u2014\"a ''vanished'' age\"\u2014and by carefully choosing names that resembled human history, Howard shrewdly avoided the problem of historical anachronisms and  his need for lengthy exposition.<ref name=\"Hyborian Genesis\"/>\n\nAccording to \"The Phoenix on the Sword\", the adventures of Conan take place \"Between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the [[Aryan race|Sons of Aryas]].\"<ref>{{cite journal|authorlink=Robert E. Howard|last=Howard|first= Robert E. |title=[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]|work=[[Weird Tales]]|issue=20|date=6 December 1932}}</ref>\n\n==Personality and character==\n{{original research|section|date=November 2011}}\n\nConan is a [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerian]]. From the writings of Robert E. Howard ([[The Hyborian Age]] among others) it is known that his Cimmerians are based on the [[Celts]]. He was born on a battlefield and is the son of a village [[blacksmith]]. Conan matured quickly as a youth and, by age fifteen, he was already a respected [[warrior]] who had participated in the destruction of the [[Aquilonia (Conan)|Aquilonian]] fortress of Venarium.<ref>''Conan the Warrior'' (1935): \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\"</ref> After its demise, he was struck by wanderlust and began the adventures chronicled by Howard, encountering skulking monsters, evil [[Magicians in fantasy|wizard]]s, tavern wenches, and beautiful [[princess]]es. He roamed throughout the [[Hyborian Age]] nations as a [[thief]], [[outlaw]], [[mercenary]], and [[pirate]].<ref>''Conan the Cimmerian'': \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\" (1934)</ref> As he grew older, he began commanding vast units of warriors and escalating his ambitions. In his forties, he seized the crown of the tyrannical [[monarch|king]] of Aquilonia, the most powerful kingdom of the Hyborian Age, having strangled the previous ruler on the steps of his own throne.<ref>''Conan the Cimmerian'': \"[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]\" (1932)</ref> Conan's adventures often result in him performing heroic feats, though his motivation for doing so is largely to protect his own survival or for personal gain.\n\nA conspicuous element of Conan's character is his [[chivalry]]. He is extremely reluctant to fight women (even when they fight him) and has a strong tendency to save [[damsels in distress]]. In \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\", he has to make a split-second decision whether to save the dancing girl Muriela or the chest of priceless gems which he spent months in search of. So, without hesitation, he rescues Muriela and allows for the treasure to be irrevocably lost. In \"[[The Black Stranger]]\", Conan saves the exile Zingaran Lady Belesa at considerable risk to himself, giving her as a parting gift his fortune in gems big enough to have a comfortable and wealthy life in Zingara, while asking for no sexual favors in return. Reviewer Jennifer Bard also noted<ref>Dr. Jennifer Agatha Bard, \"Gender Roles in Science Fiction and Fantasy\", Bulletin of Gender Equality, Summer 1986.</ref> that when Conan is in a pirate crew or a robber gang led by another male, his tendency is to subvert and undermine the leader's authority, and eventually supplant (and often, kill) him (e.g. \"[[The Pool of the Black One|Pool of the Black One]]\", \"[[A Witch Shall be Born]]\", \"[[Shadows in the Moonlight (story)|Shadows in the Moonlight]]\"). Conversely, in \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\", it is noted that Conan \"generally agreed to Belit's plan. Hers was the mind that directed their raids, his the arm that carried out her ideas. It was a good life.\" And at the end of \"[[Red Nails]]\", Conan and Valeria seem to be headed towards a reasonably amicable piratical partnership\".\n\nGeorge Baxter noted that \"Conan's recorded history mentions him as being prominently involved, at one time or another, with four different pirate fraternities, on two different seas, as well being a noted leader of land robbers at three different locales. Yet, we hardly ever see him involved in, well, robbing people. To be sure, he speaks about it often and with complete candor: \"We [[Cossack|Kozaks]] took to plundering the outlying dominions of Koth, Zamora, and Turan impartially\" he says in \"[[Shadows in the Moonlight (story)|Shadows in the Moonlight]]\". But that was ''before'' the story began. And \"We're bound for waters where the seaports are fat, and the merchant ships are crammed with plunder!\" Conan declares at the end of \"[[The Pool of the Black One]]\". But this plundering will take place ''after'' the story ends. When we see Conan onstage, we see him do many other things: He intervenes in the politics and dynastic struggles of various kingdoms; he hunts for hidden treasure; he explores desert islands and lost cities; he fights countless terrible monsters and evil sorcerers; he saves countless beautiful women and makes them fall in love with him... What we virtually never see Conan do is engage in the proper business of an armed robber, on land or by sea\u2014which is to attack people who never threatened or provoked you, take away their possessions by main force, and run your sword through them if they dare to resist. A bit messy business, that. Armchair adventurers, who like to enjoy a good yarn in the perfect safety and comfort of their suburban homes, might not have liked to read it.<ref>George Xavier Baxter, \"Heroic Fantasy and Mundane Reality\", in ''Proceedings of the Pacific Northwest Literary Society'', Autumn 1997</ref>\n\n===Appearance===\n{{Quote box\n|quote = Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet.\" |source = [[Robert E. Howard]], ''[[The Phoenix on the Sword]]'', 1932.|width = 40%|bgcolor =}}\nConan has \"sullen\", \"smoldering\", and \"volcanic\" blue eyes with a black \"square-cut mane\". Howard once describes him as having a hairy chest and, while comic book interpretations often portray Conan as wearing a loincloth or other minimalist clothing to give him a more barbaric image, Howard describes the character as wearing whatever garb is typical for the kingdom and culture in which Conan finds himself. Howard never gave a strict height or weight for Conan in a story, only describing him in loose terms like \"giant\" and \"massive\".<ref>Howard, Robert E. \"[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]\": \"the man was almost a giant in stature\"; \"Knots and bunches of muscle started out of the massive arms\".</ref> In the tales, no human is ever described as being stronger than Conan, although several are mentioned as taller (such as the strangler Baal-pteor) or of larger bulk. In a letter to [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John Drury Clark|John D. Clark]] in 1936, only three months before Howard's death, Conan is described as standing {{convert|6|ft|m}} and weighing {{convert|180|lb}} when he takes part in an attack on Venarium at only 14 years old, though being far from fully grown. Conan himself says in \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\" that he had \"...not yet seen 15 snows\".\n\nAlthough Conan is muscular, Howard frequently compares his agility and way of moving to that of a panther (see, for instance, \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\", \"[[Beyond the Black River]]\", or \"[[Rogues in the House]]\"). His skin is frequently characterized as bronzed from constant exposure to the sun. In his younger years, he is often depicted wearing a light [[Chainmail|chain]] shirt and a horned helmet, though appearances vary with different stories.\n\nDuring his reign as king of Aquilonia, Conan was\n::... a tall man, mightily shouldered and deep of chest, with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs. He was clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked in gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his square-cut black mane; but the great sword at his side seemed more natural to him than the regal accoutrements. His brow was low and broad, his eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His dark, scarred, almost sinister face was that of a fighting-man, and his velvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of his limbs.<ref>Howard, Robert E. Howard ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]'', reprinted ''The Bloody Crown of Conan'', pp. 89-90</ref>\n\nHoward [[Cimmeria (Conan)|imagined the Cimmerians]] as a [[pre-Celtic]] people with mostly black hair and blue or grey eyes. Ethnically, the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians to which Conan belongs]] are descendants of the [[Atlantis|Atlanteans]], though they don't remember their ancestry. In his fictional historical essay \"[[The Hyborian Age]]\", Howard describes how the people of Atlantis\u2014the land where his character [[King Kull]] originated\u2014had to move east after a great cataclysm changed the face of the world and sank their island, settling where [[Ireland]] and [[Scotland]] would eventually be located. Thus they are (in Howard's work) the ancestors of the Irish and Scottish (the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Gaels]]) and not the [[Picts]], the other ancestor of modern Scots who also appear in Howard's work. In the same work, Howard also described how the [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerians]] eventually moved south and east after the [[The Hyborian Age|age of Conan]] (presumably in the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]], where the [[Cimmerian|historical Cimmerians]] dwelt).\n\n===Abilities===\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\nDespite his brutish appearance, Conan uses his brains as well as his brawn. The [[Cimmeria (Conan)|Cimmerian]] is a highly skilled warrior, possibly without peer with a sword, but his travels have given him vast experience in other trades, especially as a [[Thief (character class)|thief]]. He is also a talented commander, tactician, and strategist, as well as a born leader. In addition, Conan has advanced knowledge of languages and codes and is able to recognize, or even decipher, certain ancient or secret signs and writings. For example, in \"[[Jewels of Gwahlur]]\" Howard states: \"In his roaming about the world the giant adventurer had picked up a wide smattering of knowledge, particularly including the speaking and reading of many alien tongues. Many a sheltered scholar would have been astonished at the Cimmerian's linguistic abilities.\" He also has incredible stamina, enabling him to go without sleep for a few days. In \"[[A Witch Shall be Born]]\", Conan fights armed men until he is overwhelmed, captured, and [[crucifixion|crucified]], and goes an entire night and day without water. However, Conan still possesses the strength to pull the nails from his feet, while hoisting himself into a horse's saddle and riding for ten miles.\n\nAnother noticeable trait is his sense of humor, largely absent in the comics and movies, but very much a part of Howard's original vision of the character (particularly apparent in \"[[Xuthal of the Dusk]]\", also known as \"The Slithering Shadow.\") His sense of humor can also be rather grimly ironic, as was demonstrated by how he unleashes his own version of justice on the treacherous\u2014and ill-fated\u2014innkeeper Aram Baksh in \"[[Shadows in Zamboula]]\".\n\nHe is a loyal friend to those true to him, with a barbaric code of conduct that often marks him as more honorable than the more sophisticated people he meets in his travels. Indeed, his straightforward nature and barbarism are constants in all the tales.\n\nConan is a formidable combatant both armed and unarmed. With his back to the wall, Conan is capable of engaging and killing opponents by the score. This is seen in several stories, such as \"[[Queen of the Black Coast]]\", \"[[The Scarlet Citadel]]\", and \"[[A Witch Shall Be Born]]\". Conan is not superhuman, though; he needed the providential help of Zelata's wolf to defeat four Nemedian soldiers in Howard's novel ''[[The Hour of the Dragon]]''. Some of his hardest victories have come from fighting single opponents of inhuman strength: one such as Thak, an ape-like humanoid from \"[[Rogues in the House]]\", or the strangler Baal-Pteor in \"Shadows in Zamboula\". Conan is far from untouchable and has been captured or defeated several times (on one occasion, knocking himself out drunkenly after running into a wall).\n\n===Influences===\n{{main|Robert E. Howard}}\nHoward frequently corresponded with [[H. P. Lovecraft]], and the two would sometimes insert references or elements of each other's settings in their works. Later editors reworked many of the original Conan stories by Howard, thus diluting this connection. Nevertheless, many of Howard's unedited Conan stories are arguably part of the [[Cthulhu Mythos]].<ref>Louinet, p. 436</ref> Additionally, many of the Conan stories by Howard, de Camp, and Carter used geographical place names from [[Clark Ashton Smith]]'s [[Hyperborean Cycle]].\n\n==Original Robert E.

Sprague de Camp]], [[Roland J. Green]], [[John C. Hocking]], [[Robert Jordan]], [[Sean A. Moore]], [[Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg]], [[Andrew J. Offutt]], [[Steve Perry (author)|Steve Perry]], [[John Maddox Roberts]], [[Harry Turtledove]], and [[Karl Edward Wagner]]. Some of these writers have finished incomplete Conan manuscripts by Howard. Others were created by rewriting Howard stories which originally featured entirely different characters from entirely different milieus. Most, however, are completely original works. In total, more than fifty novels and dozens of short stories featuring the Conan character have been written by authors other than Howard.\n\nThe [[Conan (books)#Gnome Press editions, 1950-1957|Gnome Press edition]] (1950\u20131957) was the first hardcover collection of Howard's Conan stories, including all the original Howard material known to exist at the time, some left unpublished in his lifetime. The later volumes contain some stories rewritten by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] (like \"[[The Treasure of Tranicos]]\"), including several non-Conan Howard stories, mostly historical exotica situated in the [[Levant]] at the time of the [[Crusades]], which he turned into Conan yarns. The Gnome edition also issued the first Conan story written by an author other than Howard\u2014the final volume published, which is by [[Bj\u00f6rn Nyberg]] and revised by de Camp.\n\nThe [[Conan (books)#Lancer/Ace paperback editions, 1966-1977|Lancer/Ace editions]] (1966\u20131977), under the direction of [[L. Sprague de Camp|de Camp]] and [[Lin Carter]], were the first comprehensive paperbacks, compiling the material from the Gnome Press series together in chronological order with all the remaining original Howard material, including that left unpublished in his lifetime and fragments and outlines. These were completed by de Camp and Carter. The series also included Howard stories originally featuring other protagonists that were rewritten by de Camp as Conan stories. New Conan stories written entirely by de Camp and Carter were added as well. Lancer Books went out of business before bringing out the entire series, the publication of which was completed by Ace Books. Eight of the eventual twelve volumes published featured dynamic cover paintings by [[Frank Frazetta]] that, for many fans,{{who|date=December 2017}} presented the definitive, iconic impression of Conan and his world. For decades to come, most other portrayals of the Cimmerian and his imitators were heavily influenced by the cover paintings of this series.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nMost editions after the Lancer/Ace series have been of either the original Howard stories or Conan material by others, but not both. The exception are the [[Conan (books)#Ace Maroto editions, 1978-1981|Ace Maroto editions]] (1978&ndash;1981), which include both new material by other authors and older material by Howard, though the latter are some of the non-Conan tales rewritten as Conan stories by de Camp. Notable later editions of the original Howard Conan stories include the [[Conan (books)#Donald M. Grant editions, 1974-1989|Donald M. Grant editions]] (1974&ndash;1989, incomplete); [[Conan (books)#Berkley editions, 1977|Berkley editions]] (1977); [[Conan (books)#Gollancz editions, 2000-2006|Gollancz editions]] (2000\u20132006), and [[Conan (books)#Wandering Star/Del Rey editions, 2003-2005|Wandering Star/Del Rey editions]] (2003\u20132005). Later series of new Conan material include the [[Conan (books)#Bantam editions, 1978-1982|Bantam editions]] (1978&ndash;1982) and [[Conan (books)#Tor editions, 1982-2004|Tor editions]] (1982\u20132004).\n\n==Conan chronologies==\n{{main|Conan chronologies}}\n\nIn an attempt to provide a coherent timeline which fit the numerous adventures of Conan penned by Robert E. Howard and later writers, various \"Conan chronologies\" have been prepared by many people from the 1930s onward. Note that no consistent timeline has yet accommodated every single Conan story. The following are the principal theories that have been advanced over the years.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Miller/Clark/de Camp chronology|Miller/Clark chronology]] \u2013 ''A Probable Outline of Conan's Career'' (1936) was the first effort to put the tales in chronological order. Completed by [[P. Schuyler Miller]] and [[John Drury Clark]], the chronology was later revised by Clark and [[L. Sprague de Camp]] in ''An Informal Biography of Conan the Cimmerian'' (1952).\n* [[Conan chronologies#Robert Jordan chronology|Robert Jordan chronology]] \u2013 ''A Conan Chronology by Robert Jordan'' (1987) was a new chronology written by Conan writer [[Robert Jordan]] that included all written Conan material up to that point. It was heavily influenced by the Miller/Clark/de Camp chronologies, though it departed from them in a number of idiosyncratic instances.\n* [[Conan chronologies#William Galen Gray chronology|William Galen Gray chronology]] \u2013 ''Timeline of Conan's Journeys'' (1997, rev.&nbsp;2004), was fan William Galen Gray's attempt to create \"a chronology of all the stories, both Howard and pastiche.\" Drawing on the earlier Miller/Clark and Jordan chronologies, it represents the ultimate expression of their tradition to date.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Joe Marek chronology|Joe Marek chronology]] \u2013 Joe Marek's chronology is limited to stories written (or devised) by Howard, though within that context it is essentially a revision of the Miller/Clark tradition to better reflect the internal evidence of the stories and avoid forcing Conan into what he perceives as a \"mad dash\" around the Hyborian world within timeframes too rapid to be credible.\n* [[Conan chronologies#Dale Rippke chronology|Dale Rippke chronology]] \u2013 ''The Darkstorm Conan Chronology'' (2003) was a completely revised and heavily researched chronology, radically repositioning a number of stories and including only those stories written or devised by Howard. The [[Conan (Dark Horse comic)|Dark Horse comic series]] follows this chronology.\n\n==Media==\n{{See also|Adaptations of works by Robert E. Howard}}\n\n===Films===\n<!-- Please do not include overviews of the Kull or Red Sonja films as such data belongs on their respective articles. -->\n\n====''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) and ''Conan the Destroyer'' (1984)====\n{{main|Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Destroyer}}\n\nThe very first Conan cinematic project was planned by [[Edward Summer]]. Summer envisioned a series of Conan films, much like the [[James Bond]] franchise. He outlined six stories for this film series, but none were ever made. An original screenplay by Summer and [[Roy Thomas]] was written, but their lore-authentic screen story was never filmed. However, the resulting film, ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]'' (1982), was a combination of director [[John Milius]]' ideas and plots from Conan stories (written also by Howard's successors, notably [[Lin Carter]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]]). The addition of [[Nietzschean]] motto and Conan's life philosophy were crucial for bringing the spirit of Howard's literature to the screen.\n\nThe plot of ''Conan the Barbarian'' (1982) begins with Conan being enslaved by the Vanir raiders of [[Thulsa Doom (character)|Thulsa Doom]], a malevolent [[warlord]] who is responsible for the slaying of Conan's parents and the genocide of his people. Later, Thulsa Doom becomes a cult leader of a [[religion]] that worships Set, a Snake God. The vengeful Conan, the [[Archery|archer]] Subotai and the [[thief]] Valeria set out on a quest to rescue a princess held captive by Thulsa Doom. The film was directed by John Milius and produced by [[Dino De Laurentiis]]. The character of Conan was played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and was his break-through role as an actor.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Ephraim |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Film Encyclopedia |year=2006 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=0-06-074214-3}}</ref>\n\nThis film was followed by a less popular sequel, ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' in 1984.<ref name=\"tessay\">{{cite news|first=Clark |last=Collis |coauthors= |title=Empire Essay: The Terminator |date= |publisher= |url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |work=Empire magazine |pages= |accessdate=2007-04-22 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235924/http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?FID=132648 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}</ref> This sequel was a more typical [[fantasy]]-genre film and was even less faithful to Howard's Conan stories, being just a [[picaresque]] story of an assorted bunch of adventurers.\n\nThe third film in the ''Conan'' trilogy was planned for 1987 to be titled ''Conan the Conqueror''.

The series involved Conan chasing [[Serpent Men]] across the world in an attempt to release his parents from eternal imprisonment as living statues.\n** '''''[[Conan and the Young Warriors]]''''' is an animated television series that premiered in 1994 and ran for 13 episodes. [[DiC Entertainment]] produced the show and [[CBS]] aired this series as a spin-off to the previous animated series. This cartoon took place after the finale of ''Conan the Adventurer'' with Wrath-Amon vanquished and Conan's family returned to life from living stone. Conan soon finds that the family of one of his friends are being turned into wolves by an evil sorceress and he must train three warriors in order to aid him in rescuing them.\n* '''[[Conan the Adventurer (1997 TV series)|''Conan the Adventurer'']]''' is a [[live-action]] television series that premiered on September 22, 1997, and ran for 22 episodes. It starred German bodybuilder [[Ralf M\u00f6ller]] as Conan and [[Danny Woodburn]] as his sidekick Otli. The storyline was quite different from the Conan lore of Howard. In this adaptation, Conan is a pleasant and jovial person. Also in this version, Conan is not a loner but one member of a merry band of adventurers.\n* In February 2018, Deadline reported that a new Conan TV series was in the works at [[Amazon Prime]] with [[Ryan Condal]], [[Miguel Sapochnik]], [[Warren Littlefield]], [[Pathfinder Media]] and [[Endeavor Content]] working on the project.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|url=https://deadline.com/2018/02/amazon-developing-conan-drama-based-robert-e-howard-books-colony-co-creator-1202278547/|title=Conan the Barbarian TV Series In Works At Amazon From Ryan Condal, Miguel Sapochnik & Warren Littlefield|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=February 5, 2018|work=Deadline Hollywood}}</ref>\n\n===Comics===\n{{main|Conan (comics)}}\n{{See also|Conan (Marvel Comics)||Conan (Dark Horse Comics)}}\nConan the Barbarian has appeared in comics nearly non-stop since 1970.

DeMatteis]], [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]], [[Michael Fleisher]], [[Doug Moench]], [[Jim Owsley]], [[Alan Zelenetz]], [[Chuck Dixon]] and Don Kraar. In 1974, ''Conan the Barbarian'' series spawned the more adult-oriented, black-and-white comics magazine ''Savage Sword of Conan'', written by Thomas with art mostly by Buscema or [[Alfredo Alcala]]. Marvel also published several [[graphic novels]] starring the character {{citation needed|date=December 2017}}, and a [[Official Handbook of the Conan Universe|handbook]] with detailed information about the Hyborian world.\n\nThe Marvel Conan stories were also adapted as a newspaper [[comic strip]] which appeared daily and Sunday from 4&nbsp;September 1978 to 12&nbsp;April 1981. Originally written by Roy Thomas and illustrated by John Buscema, the strip was continued by several different Marvel artists and writers.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics]] began their comic adaptation of the Conan saga in 2003. Entitled simply ''Conan'', the series was first written by [[Kurt Busiek]] and pencilled by [[Cary Nord]]. [[Tim Truman]] replaced Busiek when Busiek signed an exclusive contract with [[DC Comics]]; however, Busiek issues were sometimes used for filler. This series is an interpretation of the original Conan material by Robert E. Howard with no connection whatsoever to the earlier Marvel comics or any Conan story not written or envisioned by Howard supplemented by wholly original material.\n\nA second series, ''[[Conan the Cimmerian (comics)|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' was released in 2008 by [[Tim Truman]] (writer) and [[Tom\u00e1s Giorello]] (artist).

His best known films are ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]'' (1962), ''[[Le Joli Mai]]'' (1963), ''[[A Grin Without a Cat]]'' (1977) and ''[[Sans Soleil]]'' (1983). Marker is often associated with the [[Left Bank Cinema]] movement that occurred in the late 1950s and included such other filmmakers as [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], [[Henri Colpi]] and [[Armand Gatti]].\n\nHis friend and sometime collaborator Alain Resnais called him \"the prototype of the twenty-first-century man.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman\">Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 2. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1988. 649\u2013654.</ref> Film theorist Roy Armes has said of him: \"Marker is unclassifiable because he is unique...The French Cinema has its dramatists and its poets, its technicians, and its autobiographers, but only has one true essayist: Chris Marker.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\n==Early life==\n\nMarker was born '''Christian Fran\u00e7ois Bouche-Villeneuve'''. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=317| title= ''Chris Marker biography'' Electronic Arts Intermix |accessdate= Dec 22, 2016}} </ref> He was always elusive about his past and known to refuse interviews and not allow photographs to be taken of him; his place of birth is highly disputed.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> Some sources and Marker himself claim that he was born in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia.<ref>Thomson, David, ''The New Biographical Dictionary of Film''{{spaced ndash}} Fourth Edition, Little, Brown (2003).</ref> Other sources say he was born in [[Belleville, Paris]], and others, in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> The 1949 edition of ''Le C\u0153ur Net'' specifies his birthday as 22 July. Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] has stated: \"Marker told me himself that Mongolia is correct.

During the German occupation of France, he joined the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis (FTP)]], a part of the [[French Resistance]]. At some point during the war he left France and joined the [[United States Air Force]] as a paratrooper,<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> although some sources claim that this is not true.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chrismarker.org/2008/03/nyt-all-movie-guides-chris-marker-bio/ |title=NYT & All Movie Guide\u2019s Chris Marker Bio \u2013 Notes from the Era of Imperfect Memory |publisher=Chrismarker.org |date=29 July 1921 |accessdate=9 August 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819201105/http://www.chrismarker.org/2008/03/nyt-all-movie-guides-chris-marker-bio/ |archivedate=19 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After the war, he began a career as a journalist, first writing for the journal ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', a neo-Catholic, [[Marxist]] magazine where he met fellow journalist [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]]. At ''Esprit'', Marker wrote political commentaries, poems, short stories, and (with Bazin) film reviews. He would later become an early contributor to Bazin's ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]''.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nDuring this time period, Marker began to travel around the world as a journalist and photographer, a vocation he would continue the rest of his life. He was hired by the French publishing company [[\u00c9ditions du Seuil]] as editor of the series ''Petite Plan\u00e8te'' (\"Small World\"). This collection devoted one edition to each country and included information and photographs.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> In 1949 Marker published his first novel, ''Le Coeur net'' (''The Forthright Spirit''), which was about aviation. In 1952 Marker published an illustrated essay on French writer [[Jean Giraudoux]], ''Giraudoux Par Lui-M\u00eame''.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\n==Early career (1950\u20131961)==\n\nDuring his early journalism career, Marker became increasingly interested in filmmaking and experimented with photography in the early 1950s. Around this time Marker met and befriended many members of what would be called the [[Left Bank Cinema|Left Bank Film Movement]], including [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], [[Henri Colpi]], [[Armand Gatti]] and the novelists [[Marguerite Duras]] and [[Jean Cayrol]]. This group is often associated with the [[French New Wave]] directors who came to prominence during the same time period, and indeed both groups were often friends and journalistic co-workers. The term ''Left Bank'' was first coined by film critic [[Richard Roud]],<ref name=hfa>{{cite web|title=The Left Bank Revisited: Marker, Resnais, Varda|work=Harvard Film Archive|url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2000mayjun/leftbank.html|accessdate=16 August 2008}}</ref> who has described them as having \"fondness for a kind of [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the [[plastic arts]], and a consequent interest in [[experimental film]]making\", as well as an identification with the political [[left wing|left]].<ref name=hfa/> Many of Marker's earliest films were produced by [[Anatole Dauman]].\n\nIn 1952 Marker made his first film, ''[[Olympia 52]]'', a 16mm feature documentary about the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Helsinki Olympic Games]]. In 1953 Marker collaborated with Resnais on the documentary ''[[Statues Also Die]]''. The film examines traditional [[African art]] such as sculptures and masks, and its decline with coming of Western colonialism. The film won the 1954 [[Prix Jean Vigo]], but was banned by French censors for its criticism of French colonialism.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nAfter working as assistant director on Resnais's ''[[Night and Fog (1955 film)|Night and Fog]]'' in 1955, Marker made ''Sunday in Peking'', a short documentary \"[[Essay#Film|film essay]]\" that would characterize Marker's unique film style for most of his career. The film was shot in two weeks by Marker while he was traveling through China with Armand Gatti in September 1955. In the film, Marker's commentary overlaps scenes from China, such as tombs which, contrary to Westernized understandings of Chinese legends, do not contain the remains of any [[Ming Dynasty]] emperors.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nAfter working on the commentary for Resnais' film ''Le myst\u00e8re de l'atelier quinze'' in 1957, Marker continued to form his own cinematic style with the feature documentary ''Letter from Siberia''. An essay film on the narrativization of Siberia, it contains Marker's signature commentary, which takes the form of a letter from the director, in the long tradition of epistolary treatments by French explorers of the \"undeveloped\" world.  ''Letter '' looks at the modernization of Siberia with its movement into the twentieth century, but with a look back at some of the tribal cultural practices now receding into the past. It combines footage that Marker shot in [[Siberia]] with old newsreel footage, cartoon sequences, stills, and even an illustration of [[Alfred E. Neuman]] from ''[[Mad Magazine]]'' as well as a fake TV commercial as part of a humorous attack on Western mass culture.  In producing a meta-commentary on narrativity and film, Marker uses the same brief filmic sequence three times but with different commentary\u2014the first one praising the Soviet Union, the second denouncing it, and the third taking an apparently neutral or \"objective\" stance.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nIn 1959 Marker made the animated film ''Les Astronautes'' with [[Walerian Borowczyk]]. The film was a combination of traditional drawings with still photography. In 1960 Marker made ''Description d'un combat'', a documentary on the [[Israel|State of Israel]] which reflects on the country's past and future.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> The film won the Golden Bear for Best Documentary at the [[11th Berlin International Film Festival|1961 Berlin Film Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Preise & Auszeichnungen 1961|date=|work=berlinale.de|url=http://www.berlinale.de/de/archiv/jahresarchive/1961/03_preistr_ger_1961/03_Preistraeger_1961.html}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1961, Marker traveled to Cuba and shot the film ''\u00a1Cuba S\u00ed!'' The film promotes and defends [[Fidel Castro]] and includes two interviews with the Comandante. The film ends with an anti-American epilogue in which the United States is embarrassed by the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] fiasco, and was subsequently banned. The banned essay was included in Marker's first volume of collected film commentaries, ''Commentaires I'', published in 1961. The following year Marker published ''Cor\u00e9ennes'', a collection of photographs and essays on the conditions of [[Korea]].<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\n==''La Jet\u00e9e'' and ''Le Joli Mai'' (1962\u20131966)==\n\nMarker became known internationally for the short film ''[[La Jet\u00e9e]]'' (''The Pier'') in 1962. It tells of a [[post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-nuclear war]] experiment in [[time travel]] by using a series of filmed photographs developed as a [[photomontage]] of varying pace, with limited narration and sound effects. In the film, a survivor of a futuristic third World War is obsessed with distant and disconnected memories of a pier at the [[Orly Airport]], the image of a mysterious woman, and a man's death. Scientists experimenting in time travel choose him for their studies, and the man travels back in time to contact the mysterious woman, and discovers that the man's death at the Orly Airport was his own. Except for one shot of the woman mentioned above sleeping and suddenly waking up, the film is composed entirely of photographs by Jean Chiabaud and stars Davos Hanich as the man, [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Chatelain]] as the woman and filmmaker [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]] as a man from the future.\n\n''La Jet\u00e9e'' was the inspiration for [[Mamoru Oshii]]'s 1987 debut live action feature ''[[The Red Spectacles]]'' (and later for parts of Oshii's 2001 film ''[[Avalon (2001 film)|Avalon]]'' as well) and also inspired [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' (1995). It also inspired many of director [[Mira Nair]]'s shots for the 2006 film ''[[The Namesake (film)|The Namesake]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n\nWhile making ''La Jetee'', Marker was simultaneously making the 150-minute documentary essay-film ''[[Le joli mai]]'', released in 1963. Beginning in the Spring of 1962, Marker and his camera operator Pierre Lhomme shot 55 hours of footage interviewing random people on the streets of Paris. The questions, asked by the unseen Marker, range from their personal lives, as well as social and political issues of relevance at that time. As he had with montages of landscapes and indigenous art, Marker created a film essay that contrasted and juxtaposeed a variety of lives with his signature commentary (spoken by Marker's friends, singer-actor [[Yves Montand]] in the French version and [[Simone Signoret]] in the English version). The film has been compared to the ''[[Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9]]'' films of [[Jean Rouch]], and criticized by its practitioners at the time.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> The term \"Cin\u00e9ma v\u00e9rit\u00e9\" was itself anathema to Marker; he would never use it. It was shown in competition at the 1963 [[Venice Film Festival]], where it won the award for Best First Work. It also won the Golden Dove Award at the Leipzig DOK Festival.\n\nAfter the documentary ''Le Myst\u00e8re Koumiko'' in 1965, Marker made ''Si j'avais quatre dromadaires'', an essay-film that, like ''La jet\u00e9e'', is a [[photomontage]] of over 800 photographs that Marker had taken over the past 10 years from 26 countries. The commentary takes on a slightly different dimension from his previous commentaries by using a conversation between a fictitious photographer and two friends, who discuss the photos. The film's title is an allusion to a poem by [[Guillaume Apollinaire]]. It was the last film in which Marker included \"travel footage\" for many years.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\n==SLON and ISKRA (1967\u20131974)==\n\nIn 1967 Marker published his second volume of collected film essays, ''Commentaires II''. That same year, Marker organized the omnibus film ''[[Far from Vietnam|Loin du Vietnam]]'', a protest against the [[Vietnam War]] with segments contributed by Marker, [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Alain Resnais]], [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]], [[Claude Lelouch]], [[William Klein (photographer)|William Klein]], Michele Ray and [[Joris Ivens]]. The film includes footage of the war, from both sides, as well as anti-war protests in New York and Paris and other anti-war activities.\n\nFrom this initial collection of filmmakers with left-wing political agendas, Marker created the group S.L.O.N. (''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour le lancement des oeuvres nouvelles'',\"Society for launching new works\", but also the Russian word for \"elephant\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrismarker.org/wounded-time/ |title=Wounded Time \u2013 Notes from the Era of Imperfect Memory |publisher=Chrismarker.org |date= |accessdate=9 August 2012}}</ref> SLON was a film collective whose objectives were to make films and to encourage industrial workers to create film collectives of their own. Its members included Valerie Mayoux, Jean-Claude Lerner, Alain Adair and John Tooker. Marker is usually credited as director or co-director of all of the films made by SLON.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nAfter the events of [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], Marker felt a moral obligation to abandon his own personal film career and devote himself to SLON and its activities. SLON's first film was about a strike at a Rhodiac\u00e9ta factory in France, ''[[\u00c0 bient\u00f4t, j'esp\u00e8re]]'' (''Rhodiac\u00e9ta'') in 1968.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> Later that year SLON made ''La Sixi\u00e8me face du pentagone'', about an anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. and was a reaction to what SLON considered to be the unfair and censored reportage of such events on mainstream television. The film was shot by [[Fran\u00e7ois Reichenbach]], who received co-director credit. ''La Bataille des dix millions'' was made in 1970 with Mayoux as co-director and [[Santiago \u00c1lvarez (filmmaker)|Santiago \u00c1lvarez]] as cameraman and is about the 1970 sugar crop in Cuba and its disastrous effects on the country. In 1971, SLON made ''Le Train en marche'', a new prologue to Soviet filmmaker Aleksandr Medvedkin's 1935 film ''Schastye'', which had recently been re-released in France.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nIn 1974, SLON became I.S.K.R.A. (''Images, Sons, Kinescope, R\u00e9alisations, Audiovisuelles'', but also the name of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s political newspaper ''[[Iskra]],'' which also is a Russian word for \"spark\").<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\n==Return to personal work (1974\u20131986)==\n\nIn 1974 returned to his personal work and made a film outside of ISKRA. ''La Solitude du chanteur de fond'' is a one-hour documentary about Marker's friend [[Yves Montand]]'s benefit concert for Chilean refugees. The concert was Montand's first public performance in four years, and the documentary includes film clips from his long career as a singer and actor.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nMarker had been working on a film about [[Chile]] with ISKRA since 1973. Marker had collaborated with Belgian sociologist [[Armand Mattelart]] and ISKRA members Val\u00e9rie Mayoux and Jacqueline Meppiel to shoot and collect the visual materials, which Marker then edited together and provided the commentary for. The resulting film was the two and a half-hour documentary ''La Spirale'', released in 1975. The film chronicles events in Chile, beginning with the [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|1970 election]] of socialist President [[Salvador Allende]] until his [[Death of Salvador Allende|murder]] and [[1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat|the resulting coup]] in 1973.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\nMarker then began work on one of his most ambitious films, ''[[A Grin Without a Cat]]'', released in 1977. The film's title refers to the [[Cheshire Cat]] from ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. The metaphor compares the promise of the global socialist movement before [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] (the grin) with its actual presence in the world after May 1968 (the cat). The film's original French title is ''Le fond de l'air est rouge'', which means \"the air is essentially red\", or \"revolution is in the air\", implying that the socialist movement was everywhere around the world.<ref name=\"Sterritt\">{{Cite journal|last=Sterritt|first=David|authorlink=David Sterritt|year=2009|url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/ema-grin-without-a-catem|title=A Grin Without a Cat|work=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]|publisher=Cineaste Publishers|volume=34|issue=4|accessdate=31 July 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928220805/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/ema-grin-without-a-catem|archivedate=28 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe film was intended to be an all-encompassing portrait of political movements since May 1968, a summation of the work which he had taken part in for ten years. The film is divided into two parts: the first half focuses on the hopes and idealism before May 1968, and the second half on the disillusion and disappointments since those events. Marker begins the film with the [[The Battleship Potemkin#The Odessa Steps sequence|Odessa Steps sequence]] from [[Sergei Eisenstein]]'s film ''[[The Battleship Potemkin]]'', which Marker points out is a fictitious creation of Eisenstein which has still influenced the image of the historical event. Marker used very little commentary in this film, but the film's montage structure and preoccupation with memory make it a Marker film. Upon release, the film was criticized for not addressing many current issues of the New Left such as the woman's movement, sexual liberation and worker self-management.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> The film was re-released in the US in 2002.<ref name=\"Sterritt\" />\n\nIn the late 1970s, Marker traveled extensively throughout the world, including an extended period in Japan. From this inspiration, he first published the [[photo-essay]] ''Le D\u00e9pays'' in 1982, and then used the experience for his next film ''[[Sans Soleil]]'', released in 1982.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\n''[[Sans Soleil]]'' stretches the limits of what could be called a documentary. It is an essay, a [[Film editing|montage]], mixing pieces of documentary with fiction and philosophical comments, creating an atmosphere of [[dream]] and science fiction. The main themes are Japan, Africa, [[memory]] and travel. A sequence in the middle of the film takes place in San Francisco, and heavily references [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''. Marker has said that ''Vertigo'' is the only film \"capable of portraying impossible memory, insane memory.\"<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> The film's commentary are credited to the fictitious cameraman Sandor Krasna, and read in the form of letters by an unnamed woman. Though centered around Japan, the film was also shot in such other countries as [[Guinea Bissau]], Ireland and [[Iceland]].<ref name=\"Wakeman\" /> ''Sans Soleil'' was shown at the [[1983 Berlin Film Festival]] where it won the OCIC Award. It was also awarded the Sutherland Trophy at the 1983 [[British Film Institute]] Awards.\n\nIn 1984, Marker was invited by producer [[Serge Silberman]] to document the making of [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[Ran (film)|Ran]]''. From this Marker made ''[[A.K. (film)|A.K.]]'', released in 1985. The film focuses more on Kurosawa's remote but polite personality than on the making of the film.<ref>[http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/2_AK Chicago Reader: Dave Kehr's Review of AK]</ref> The film was screened in the [[Un Certain Regard]] section at the [[1985 Cannes Film Festival]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1107/year/1985.html |title=Festival de Cannes: A.K. |accessdate=28 June 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}</ref> before ''Ran'' itself had been released.\n\nIn 1985, Marker's long-time friend and neighbor [[Simone Signoret]] died of cancer. Marker then made the one-hour TV documentary ''M\u00e9moires pour Simone'' as a tribute to her in 1986.<ref name=\"Wakeman\" />\n\n==Multimedia and later career (1987\u20132012)==\n\nBeginning with ''Sans Soleil'', he developed a deep interest in [[Digital data|digital]] technology. From 1985 to 1988, he worked on a conversational program (a prototypical chatbot) called \"Dialector,\" which he wrote in [[Applesoft BASIC]] on an [[Apple II]]. He incorporated audiovisual elements in addition to the snippets of dialogue and poetry that \"Computer\" exchanged with the user. Version 6 of this program was revived from a floppy disk (with Marker's help and permission) and emulated online in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dialector.poptronics.fr/|title=History of the Dialector Program|last=de Cayeux|first=Agnes|last2=Lozano|first2=Andr\u00e8s|date=2015|website=poptronics|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514194946/http://dialector.poptronics.fr/|archive-date=May 14, 2018|dead-url=|access-date=May 14, 2018|last3=Rivoire|first3=Annick}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://chrismarker.org/history-of-the-dialector-program/|title=History of the Dialector Program|date=2015-11-01|work=Chris Marker|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nHis interests in digital technology also led to his film ''[[Level Five (film)|Level Five]]'' (1996) and ''Immemory'' (1998, 2008),<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Marker|url=http://www.eai.org/artistBio.htm?id=317|publisher=[[Electronic Arts Intermix]]|accessdate=13 April 2012}}</ref> an interactive multimedia [[CD-ROM]], produced for the [[Centre Pompidou]] (French language version) and from [[Exact Change]] (English version). Marker created a 19-minute multimedia piece in 2005 for the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City titled ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' which was influenced by [[T. S. Eliot]]'s [[The Hollow Men|poem]].<ref name=MOMA1>{{cite web |url=http://www.moma.org/visit/calendar/exhibitions/115 |title=Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men |last=Staff |date=April 2005 | publisher = [[Museum of Modern Art]] |accessdate= 7 July 2012 }}</ref>\n\nMarker lived in Paris, and very rarely granted interviews. One exception was a lengthy interview with ''[[Lib\u00e9ration]]'' in 2003 in which he explained his approach to filmmaking.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rare Marker|date=5 March 2003|newspaper=[[Lib\u00e9ration]]|url=http://next.liberation.fr/cinema/0101466984-rare-marker|language=French}}</ref> When asked for a picture of himself, he usually offered a photograph of a cat instead. (Marker was represented in Agnes Varda's 2008 documentary ''The Beaches of Agnes'' by a cartoon drawing of a cat, speaking in a technologically altered voice.) Marker's own cat was named ''Guillaume-en-\u00e9gypte''. In 2009, Marker commissioned an [[commons:File:Guillaume En-Egypte.png|Avatar of Guillaume-en-Egypte]] to represent him in [[machinima]] works. The avatar was created by Exosius Woolley and first appeared in the short film / machinima, ''Ouvroir the Movie by Chris Marker''.\n\nIn the 2007 [[Criterion Collection]] release of ''La Jet\u00e9e'' and ''Sans Soleil'', Marker included a short essay, \"Working on a shoestring budget\". He confessed to shooting all of ''Sans Soleil'' with a silent film camera, and recording all the audio on a primitive [[audio cassette]] recorder. Marker also reminds the reader that only one short scene in ''La Jet\u00e9e'' is of a moving image, as Marker could only borrow a movie camera for one afternoon while working on the film.\n\nFrom 2007 through 2011 Chris Marker had collaborated with the art dealer and publisher Peter Blum on a variety of projects which were exhibited at the Peter Blum galleries in the SoHo and Chelsea neighborhoods. Marker's works have also been exhibited at the current Peter Blum Gallery location in the Midtown neighborhood on 57th Street in the year of 2014. These projects include several series of printed photographs titled ''PASSENGERS'', ''Koreans'', ''Crush Art'', ''Quelle heure est-elle?'', and ''Staring Back''; a set of photogravures titled ''After D\u00fcrer''; a book titled ''PASSENGERS''; and digital prints of movie posters, whose titles were often appropriated, titled ''Breathless'', ''Hiroshima Mon Amour'', ''Owl People'', and ''Rin Tin Tin''. The video installations titled ''Silent Movie'' and ''Owls at Noon Prelude: The Hollow Men'' were exhibited through Peter Blum in 2009.<ref>http://peterblumgallery.com/exhibitions/chris-marker-quelle-heure-est-elle-/selected_works</ref> These mentioned works have also been exhibited at the 2014 & 2015 Venice Biennale, Whitechapel Gallery in London, the MIT List Visual Arts Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the Moscow Photobiennale, Les Recontres d'Arles de la Photographie in Arles, France, the Centre de la Photographie in Geneva, Switzerland, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, Ohio, The Museum of Modern Art in New York, and the Pacific Film Archive in Berkeley, California. Since 2014 the artworks of the Estate of Chris Marker are represented by Peter Blum Gallery, New York.<ref>http://www.peterblumgallery.com</ref><ref>http://peterblumgallery.com/artists/chris-marker/biography</ref>\n\nMarker died on 29 July 2012, 91 years to the day after his birth.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|title=Chris Marker obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/film-obituaries/9439368/Chris-Marker.html|newspaper=telegraph.co.uk|date=30 July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThe information below is obsolete, as it is very incomplete.

For instance, the vowel of the [[English language|English]] word \"feet\" can be described with reference to cardinal vowel 1, {{IPA|[i]}}, which is the cardinal vowel closest to it. It is often stated that to be able to use the cardinal vowel system effectively one must undergo training with an expert phonetician, working both on the recognition and the production of the vowels. [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]] wrote \"The values of cardinal vowels cannot be learnt from written descriptions; they should be learnt by oral instruction from a teacher who knows them\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Daniel|title=An Outline of English Phonetics|date=1967|publisher=Heffer|location=Cambridge|page=34|edition=9th}}</ref>\n\nA cardinal vowel is a [[vowel]] sound produced when the [[tongue]] is in an extreme position, either front or back, high or low. The current system was systematised by Daniel Jones in the early 20th century,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Daniel|title=An English Pronouncing Dictionary|date=1917|publisher=Dent|location=London}}</ref> though the idea goes back to earlier phoneticians, notably Ellis<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=A.J.|title=The Alphabet of Nature|date=1845|location=Bath}}</ref> and Bell.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=A.M.|title=Visible Speech|date=1867|location=London}}</ref>\n\nCardinal vowels are not vowels of any particular language, but a measuring system. However, some languages contain vowel or vowels that are close to the cardinal vowel(s).<ref>{{citation|last=Ashby|first=Patricia|title=Understanding Phonetics|year=2011|publisher=Routledge|page=85|series=Understanding Language series|isbn=978-0340928271}}</ref> An example of such language is [[Ngwe language|Ngwe]], which is spoken in [[Cameroon]]. It has been cited as a language with a vowel system that has 8 vowels which are rather similar to the 8 primary cardinal vowels (Ladefoged 1971:67).\n\nThree of the cardinal vowels\u2014{{IPA|[i]}}, {{IPA|[\u0251]}} and {{IPA|[u]}}\u2014have articulatory definitions. The vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is produced with the tongue as far forward and as high in the mouth as is possible (without producing friction), with spread lips. The vowel {{IPA|[u]}} is produced with the tongue as far back and as high in the mouth as is possible, with [[roundedness|protruded]] lips. This sound can be approximated by adopting the posture to whistle a very low note, or to blow out a candle. And {{IPA|[\u0251]}} is produced with the tongue as low and as far back in the mouth as possible.\n\nThe other vowels are 'auditorily equidistant' between these three 'corner vowels', at four degrees of aperture or 'height': close (high tongue position), close-mid, open-mid, and open (low tongue position).\n\nThese degrees of aperture plus the front-back distinction define 8 reference points on a mixture of articulatory and auditory criteria. These eight vowels are known as the eight 'primary cardinal vowels', and vowels like these are common in the world's languages.\n\nThe lip positions can be reversed with the lip position for the corresponding vowel on the opposite side of the front-back dimension, so that e.g. Cardinal 1 can be produced with rounding somewhat similar to that of Cardinal 8 (though normally [[roundedness|compressed]] rather than protruded); these are known as 'secondary cardinal vowels'. Sounds such as these are claimed to be less common in the world's languages.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladefoged|first1=P.|last2=Maddieson|first2=I.|title=The Sounds of the World's Languages|date=1996|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=0-631-19815-6|page=292}}</ref> Other vowel sounds are also recognised on the vowel chart of the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].\n\n==Table of cardinal vowels==\n\n[[Image:Daniel Jones's 18 Cardinal Vowels.svg|400px]]\n\n{| class=wikitable\n! cardinal !!

The provision of diacritics by the [[International Phonetic Association]] further implies that intermediate values may also be reliably recognized, so that a phonetician might be able to produce and recognize not only a [[close-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[e]}} and an [[open-mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[\u025b]}} but also a [[mid front unrounded vowel]] {{IPA|[e\u031e]}}, a centralized mid front unrounded vowel {{IPA|[\u00eb]}}, and so on. This suggests a range of vowels nearer to forty or fifty than to twenty in number. Empirical evidence for this ability in trained phoneticians is hard to come by.\n\nLadefoged, in a series of pioneering experiments published in the 1950s and 60s, studied how trained phoneticians coped with the vowels of a dialect of Scots Gaelic. He asked eighteen phoneticians to listen to a recording of ten words spoken by a native speaker of Gaelic and to place the vowels on a cardinal vowel quadrilateral. He then studied the degree of agreement or disagreement among the phoneticians. Ladefoged himself drew attention to the fact that the phoneticians who were trained in the British tradition established by Daniel Jones were closer to each other in their judgments than those who had not had this training. However, the most striking result is the great divergence of judgments among ''all'' the listeners regarding vowels that were distant from Cardinal values.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ladefoged|first1=P.|title=Three Areas of Experimental Phonetics|date=1967|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=132\u2013142}} See especially Figure 47 on p.&nbsp;135</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[list of phonetics topics]]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.let.uu.nl/~audiufon/data/e_cardinal_vowels.html audio demonstrations] of cardinal vowels as spoken by [[Daniel Jones (phonetician)|Daniel Jones]] at age 75\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n* Ladefoged, Peter.

At the center of Downtown is 8th Street, also known as the [[Avenue of the Columns]], which connects [[Francis Quadrangle]] and [[Jesse Hall]] to the [[Boone County Courthouse (Columbia, Missouri)|Boone County Courthouse]] and the [[City Hall (Columbia, Missouri)|City Hall]]. Originally an agricultural town, the cultivation of the mind is Columbia's chief economic concern today. Never a major center of manufacturing, the city also depends on healthcare, insurance, and technology businesses. Companies such as [[Shelter Insurance]], [[Carfax (company)|Carfax]], and [[Slackers CDs and Games]], were founded in the city. Cultural institutions include the [[State Historical Society of Missouri]], the [[Museum of Art and Archaeology]], and the annual [[True/False Film Festival]]. The [[Missouri Tigers]], the state's only major college athletic program, play football at [[Faurot Field]] and basketball at [[Mizzou Arena]] as members of the rigorous  [[Southeastern Conference]].\n\nThe city rests upon the forested hills and rolling prairies of [[Mid-Missouri]], near the [[Missouri River]] valley, where the [[Ozarks|Ozark Mountains]] begin to transform into plains and savanna. Limestone forms bluffs and glades while rain dissolves the bedrock, creating caves and springs which water the [[Hinkson Creek|Hinkson]], [[Perche Creek|Roche Perche]], and [[Bonne Femme Creek (Boone County, Missouri)|Bonne Femme]] creeks. Surrounding the city, [[Rock Bridge Memorial State Park]], [[Mark Twain National Forest]], and [[Big Muddy National Fish and Wildlife Refuge]] form a greenbelt preserving sensitive and rare environments.\n\nThe first humans who entered the area at least twelve thousand years ago were nomadic hunters. Later, woodland tribes lived in villages along waterways and [[Mound Builders|built mounds]] in high places. The [[Osage Nation|Osage]] and [[Missouria]] nations were expelled by the exploration of [[French people|French]] traders and the rapid settlement of [[United States|American]] pioneers. The latter arrived by the [[Boone's Lick Road]] and hailed from the slave-owning culture of the [[Upland South]], especially [[Virginia]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Tennessee]], giving [[Boonslick]] the name \"[[Little Dixie (Missouri)|Little Dixie]]\" during the [[American Civil War]]. German, Irish, and other European immigrants soon joined. The modern populace is unusually diverse, over eight percent foreign-born. While [[White people|White]] and [[Black people|Black]] remain the largest ethnicities, people of [[Asian people|Asian]] descent are now the third-largest group. The city has been called the \"Athens of Missouri\" for its [[Classics|classic]] beauty and educational emphasis, but is more commonly called \"CoMo\".<ref name=\"Como\" />\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Columbia, Missouri}}\n[[File:CoMoPano1869.jpg|thumb|right|An aerial depiction of Columbia's downtown district in 1869. The large building on the right is University of Missouri Academic Hall.]]\n\nColumbia's origins begin with the settlement of [[American pioneer]]s from [[Kentucky]] and [[Virginia]] in an early 1800s region known as the [[Boonslick]]. Before 1815 settlement in the region was confined to small log forts because of the threat of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack during the [[War of 1812]]. When the war ended settlers came on foot, horseback, and wagon, often moving entire households along the [[Boone's Lick Road]] and sometimes bringing [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved African Americans]]. By 1818 it was clear that the increased population would necessitate a new county be created from territorial [[Howard County, Missouri|Howard County]]. The [[Moniteau Creek (north central Missouri)|Moniteau Creek]] on the west and [[Cedar Creek (Missouri River tributary)|Cedar Creek]] on the east were obvious natural boundaries.\n\nBelieving it was only a matter of time before a county seat was chosen, the Smithton Land Company was formed to purchase over {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} to established the village of Smithton near the present-day intersection of Walnut and Garth. In 1819 Smithton was a small cluster of log cabins in an ancient forest of oak and hickory; chief among them was the cabin of [[Richard Gentry]], a trustee of the Smithton Company who would become first mayor of Columbia. In 1820 Boone County was formed and named after the recently deceased explorer [[Daniel Boone]]. The Missouri Legislature appointed John Gray, Jefferson Fulcher, Absalom Hicks, Lawrence Bass, and David Jackson as commissioners to select and establish a permanent county seat. Smithton never had more than twenty people, and it was quickly realized that well digging was difficult because of the bedrock.\n\nSprings were discovered across the [[Flat Branch|Flat Branch Creek]], so in the Spring of 1821 Columbia was laid off and the inhabitants of Smithton moved their cabins to the new town. The first house in Columbia was built by Thomas Duly in 1820 at what would become Fifth and Broadway. Columbia's permanence was ensured when it was chosen as county seat in 1821 and the Boone's Lick Road was rerouted down Broadway.\n\nThe roots of Columbia's three economic foundations\u2014education, medicine, and insurance\u2014 can be traced to the city's incorporation in 1821.<ref name=\"ckbome\">{{cite web | url=http://www.columbia.k12.mo.us/columbia/colhis.htm | title=History of Columbia | work=[[Columbia Public Schools]] | accessdate=January 1, 2008 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202045636/http://www.columbia.k12.mo.us/columbia/colhis.htm | archivedate=February 2, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"bdkfqw\">{{cite web | url=http://www.columbiaredi.com/pdfs/ColumbiaKudos.pdf | archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080216012203/http://www.columbiaredi.com/pdfs/ColumbiaKudos.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=February 16, 2008 | format=PDF | title=Columbia Kudos | work=Columbia Regional Economic Development (REDI) | accessdate=January 1, 2008 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Original plans for the town set aside land for a state university. In 1833, Columbia Baptist Female College opened, which later became [[Stephens College]]. Columbia College, distinct from today's and later to become the [[University of Missouri]], was founded in 1839. When the state legislature decided to establish a state university, Columbia raised three times as much money as any competing city,<ref name = \"skbsjf\">{{cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=300\u2013310}}</ref> and [[James S. Rollins]] donated the land that is today the Francis Quadrangle.<ref name = \"skbsjf\"/> Soon other educational institutions were founded in Columbia, such as Christian Female College, the first college for women west of the Mississippi, which later became [[Columbia College (Columbia, Missouri)|Columbia College]].\n\nThe city benefited from being a stagecoach stop of the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]] and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] trails, and later from the [[Missouri\u2013Kansas\u2013Texas Railroad]]. In 1822, [[William Jewell (educator)|William Jewell]] set up the first hospital. In 1830, the first newspaper began; in 1832, the first theater in the state was opened; and in 1835, the state's first agricultural fair was held. By 1839, the population of 13,000 and wealth of Boone County was exceeded in Missouri only by that of [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]], which, at that time, included the City of [[St. Louis]].<ref>{{cite book | last =Switzler | first=William | title=History of Boone County, Missouri | publisher=St. Louis Western Historical Company |year=1882 | pages=325\u2013327}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's infrastructure was relatively untouched by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. As a slave state, Missouri had many residents with Southern sympathies, but it stayed in the Union. The majority of the city was pro-Union;<ref name = \"ckbome\"/> however, the surrounding agricultural areas of Boone County and the rest of central Missouri were decidedly pro-Confederate. Because of this, the University of Missouri became a base from which Union troops operated. No battles were fought within the city because the presence of Union troops dissuaded Confederate guerrillas from attacking, though several major battles occurred at nearby [[Boonville, Missouri|Boonville]] and [[Centralia, Missouri|Centralia]].\n\nAfter Reconstruction, race relations in Columbia followed the Southern pattern of increasing violence of whites against blacks in efforts to suppress voting and free movement: George Burke, a black man who worked at the university, was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]] in 1889.<ref>{{cite book | last =NAACP | title=Thirty Years of Lynching in the United States, 1889\u20131918 | publisher=NAACP |year=1919 | page=80}}</ref> In the spring of 1923, James T. Scott, an African-American janitor at the University of Missouri, was arrested on allegations of raping a university professor's daughter. He was taken from the county jail and lynched on April 29 before a white mob of several hundred, hanged from the Old Stewart Road Bridge.\n\nIn the 21st century, a number of efforts have been undertaken to recognize Scott's death. In 2010 his death certificate was changed to reflect that he was never tried or convicted of charges, and that he had been lynched. In 2011 a headstone was put at his grave at Columbia Cemetery; it includes his wife's and parents' names and dates, to provide a fuller account of his life.<ref>[https://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/community-celebrates-life-of-lynching-victim-james-t-scott/article_37682fd8-806e-5805-b89e-490b9d63f69e.html Katy Bergen, \"Community celebrates life of lynching victim James T.

[[State Farm Insurance]] has a regional office in Columbia. In addition, the now-defunct Silvey Insurance was a large local employer.\n\nColumbia became a transportation crossroads when [[U.S. Route 63 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 63]] and [[U.S. Route 40 (Missouri)|U.S. Route 40]] (which was improved as present-day [[Interstate 70 (Missouri)|Interstate 70]]) were routed through the city.

Since then they have had four separate periods in the top flight of English football: 1936\u20131957, 1986\u20131990, 1998\u20131999, and 2000\u20132007. Historically, Charlton's most successful period was the 1930s, when the club's highest league finishes were recorded, including runners-up of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1937. After World War II, the club reached the [[FA Cup Final]] twice, losing in [[1946 FA Cup Final|1946]] and winning in [[1947 FA Cup Final|1947]]. The club's traditional [[Kit (association football)|kit]] consists of red shirts, white shorts and red socks, and their most commonly used nickname is ''The Addicks''. The club share [[South London derby|local rivalries]] with fellow [[Football in London|South East London]] clubs Crystal Palace and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].\n\n==History==\n{{Recentism|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Early history===\nCharlton Athletic F.C. were formed on 9 June 1905<ref name = \"Charlton Athletic - Club History\"/> by a group of 15- to 17-year-olds in East Street, Charlton, which is now known as Eastmoor Street and no longer residential.

Charlton's first Football League match was against [[Exeter City F.C.|Exeter City]] in August 1921, which they won 1\u20130. In 1923, Charlton became \"giant killers\" in the [[FA Cup]] beating top flight sides Manchester City, West Bromwich Albion, and Preston North End before losing to eventual winners Bolton Wanderers in the Quarter-Finals. Later that year, it was proposed that Charlton merge with Catford Southend to create a larger team with bigger support.<ref>Clayton 2001, p.30</ref> In the 1923\u201324 season Charlton played in Catford at [[The Mount stadium]] and wore the colours of \"The Enders\", light and dark blue vertical stripes.

Siemens Meadow (1905\u20131907), a patch of rough ground by the River Thames. This was over-shadowed by the [[Siemens Brothers]] Telegraph Works. Then followed [[Woolwich Common]] (1907\u20131908), Pound Park (1908\u20131913), and Angerstein Lane (1913\u20131915). After the end of the First World War, a chalk quarry known as the Swamps was identified as Charlton's new ground, and in the summer of 1919 work began to create the level playing area and remove debris from the site.<ref name = \"Details about Charlton Athletic\"/> The first match at this site, now known as the club's current ground The Valley, was in September 1919. Charlton stayed at The Valley until 1923, when the club moved to [[The Mount stadium]] in [[Catford]] as part of a proposed merger with Catford Southend Football Club. However, after this move collapsed in 1924 Charlton returned to The Valley.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, significant improvements were made to the ground, making it one of the largest in the country at that time.<ref name = \"Details about Charlton Athletic\"/> In 1938 the highest attendance to date at the ground was recorded at over 75,000 for a [[FA Cup]] match against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. During the 1940s and 1950s the attendance was often above 40,000, and Charlton had one of the largest support bases in the country. However, after the club's relegation little investment was made in The Valley as it fell into decline.\n\nIn the 1980s matters came to a head as the ownership of the club and The Valley was divided. The large East Terrace had been closed down by the authorities after the [[Bradford City stadium fire]] and the ground's owner wanted to use part of the site for housing. In September 1985, Charlton made the controversial move to ground-share with South London neighbours [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] at [[Selhurst Park]]. This move was unpopular with supporters and in the late 1980s significant steps were taken to bring about the club's return to The Valley.\n\nA [[Single-issue politics|single issue]] political party, the Valley Party, contested the 1990 local [[Royal Borough of Greenwich|Greenwich Borough Council]] elections on a ticket of reopening the stadium, capturing 11% of the vote,<ref name = \"Details about Charlton Athletic\"/> aiding the club's return. The Valley Gold investment scheme was created to help supporters fund the return to The Valley, and several players were also sold to raise funds.

Among the theories on the origin of the Addicks name are that it was the south-east London pronunciation of either \"haddock\" ('addock) or \"athletic\". However, the most likely origin of name is from a local fishmonger, Arthur \"Ikey\" Bryan, who rewarded the team with meals of haddock and chips.<ref>Clayton 2001, p.10</ref>\n\nThe progression of the nickname can be seen in the book ''The Addicks Cartoons: An Affectionate Look into the Early History of Charlton Athletic'', which covers the pre-First World War history of Charlton through a narrative based on 56 cartoons which appeared in the now defunct Kentish Independent. The very first cartoon, from 31 October 1908, calls the team the Haddocks. By 1910, the name had changed to Addicks although it also appeared as Haddick. The club has had two other nicknames, The Robins, adopted in 1931, and The Valiants, chosen in a fan competition in the 1960s which also led to the adoption of the sword badge which is still in use. The Addicks nickname never went away and was revived by fans after the club lost its Valley home in 1985 and went into exile at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]]. It is now once again the official nickname of the club.\n\nCharlton fans' chants have included \"Valley, Floyd Road\", a song noting the stadium's address to the tune of \"[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]\", and \"The Red, Red Robin\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cafc.co.uk/CharltonSongs.ink |title=Charlton songs |website=www.cafc.co.uk |publisher=Charlton Athletic FC |date= |accessdate=26 August 2013 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101018152928/http://cafc.co.uk/CharltonSongs.ink |archivedate=18 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nCharlton Athletic featured in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] one-off drama ''Albert's Memorial'', shown on 12 September 2010 and starring [[David Jason]] and [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.itv.com/dramapremieres/albertsmemorial/ |title=Albert's Memorial |accessdate=26 August 2013 |website=www.itv.com |publisher=ITV plc |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911172023/http://www.itv.com/dramapremieres/albertsmemorial/ |archivedate=11 September 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the long-running BBC sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', [[Rodney Trotter|Rodney Charlton Trotter]] is named after the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/amp/football/the-top-10-football-references-in-only-fools-and-horses-129868|title=The Top 10 Football References In Only Fools And Horses|website=Balls.ie}}</ref>\n\nCharlton's ground and the then manager, [[Alan Curbishley]], made appearances in the [[Sky One]] TV series, ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nCharlton Athletic has also featured in a number of book publications, in both the realm of fiction and factual/sports writing.

The first known badge, from the 1930s, consisted of the letters CAF in the shape of a [[clubs (suit)|club]] from a pack of cards. In the 1940s, Charlton used a design featuring a [[European robin|robin]] sitting in a football within a shield, sometimes with the letters CAFC in the four-quarters of the shield, which was worn for the [[1946 FA Cup Final]]. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the crest of the former metropolitan borough of Greenwich was used as a symbol for the club but this was not used on the team's shirts.<ref name = \"CrestHistory\"/>\n\nIn 1963, a competition was held to find a new badge for the club, and the winning entry was a hand holding a sword, which complied with Charlton's nickname of the time, the Valiants.<ref name = \"CrestHistory\"/> Over the next five years modifications were made to this design, such as the addition of a circle surrounding the hand and sword and including the club's name in the badge. By 1968, the design had reached the one known today, and has been used continuously from this year, apart from a period in the 1970s when just the letters CAFC appeared on the team's shirts.<ref name=\"CrestHistory\">{{cite web\n| title = Charlton Athletic F.C.

The ground-sharing arrangement \u2013 although seen by Crystal Palace chairman [[Ron Noades]] as essential for the future of football \u2013 was unpopular with both sets of fans. Indeed, the Charlton fans campaigned for a return to The Valley throughout the club's time at Selhurst Park.\n\nCharlton left Selhurst Park in 1991, and the rivalry between the teams once again returned to a nominal level until two incidents 14 years later:\n\nIn 2005, having already lost 1\u20130 to Charlton at Selhurst Park earlier in the season, Palace were relegated at The Valley after a 2\u20132 draw. After the match there was a well publicised altercation between the two chairmen [[Richard Murray (businessman)|Richard Murray]] and [[Simon Jordan]], which only served to renew old hostilities between the fans.\n\n===Millwall===\nThe rivalry began when Millwall moved south of the river in 1910 to The Den in [[New Cross]], [[South London|South East London]] situated less than 4 miles from The Valley. Matches between the two sides are always fiercely contested.\n\n==Players==\n{{updated|30 October 2018}}<ref name=\"First-\u0101 profiles\">{{cite web\n |title       = First-team profiles\n |url

Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity; however, some still use it as a means of transportation. Variants of cross-country skiing are adapted to a range of terrain which spans unimproved, sometimes mountainous terrain to groomed courses that are specifically designed for the sport.\n\nModern cross-country skiing is similar to the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including [[alpine skiing]], [[ski jumping]] and [[Telemark skiing]]. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on [[ski poles]] against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including [[Northern Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Russia]] and regions in the [[United States]].\n[[Cross-country skiing (sport)|Competitive cross-country skiing]] is one of the [[Nordic skiing]] sports. Cross-country skiing and [[marksmanship|rifle marksmanship]] are the two components of [[biathlon]], [[ski-orienteering]] is a form of cross-country skiing, which includes map navigation along snow trails and tracks.<ref name=Idrettsleksikon>{{cite book |title= Kunnskapsforlagets idrettsleksikon |trans-title= Encyclopedia of Sports |language= no |location=Oslo |publisher= Kunnskapsforlaget |year= 1990 |isbn= 82-573-0408-5}}</ref><ref name = Mountaineers>\n{{cite book\n | last = Hindman\n | first = Steve\n | title = Cross-Country Skiing: Building Skills for Fun and Fitness\n | publisher = The Mountaineers Books\n | date = 2005\n | location = Seattle\n | page = 264\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=n2ejJvg-snUC&pg=PA67&dq=Cross+country+ski+paper+test&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjj7Impq5nKAhWBlh4KHVuaCrcQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&q=Cross%20country%20ski%20paper%20test&f=false\n | isbn = 978-0-89886-862-3 }}\n</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of skiing}}\n[[File:SapmianSkier1673.png|thumb|right|[[Sami people|Sami]] hunter using skis of unequal length\u2014short for traction, long for gliding\u2014and a single pole.

The classic technique relies on a [[Ski wax|wax]] or texture on the ski bottom under the foot for [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] on the snow to allow the skier to slide the other ski forward in virgin or tracked snow. With the skate skiing technique a skier slides on alternating skis on a firm snow surface at an angle from each other in a manner similar to ice skating. Both techniques employ poles with baskets that allow the arms to participate in the propulsion. Specialized equipment is adapted to each technique and each type of terrain.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> A variety of turns are used, when descending.\n\nBoth poles can be used simultaneously (\"double-poling\"), or alternating, in classic the alternating technique is most common (the \"diagonal stride\") while in the skating technique double poles are more common.<ref name=\"Rees\"/><ref name=pole/>\n\n===Classic===\nThe classic style is often used on prepared trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It is also the most usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the \"diagonal stride\" variant the poles are planted alternately on the opposite side of the forward-striding foot; with the \"kick-double-pole\" variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion.<ref name=\"Rees\">{{Cite book | edition = 3d | publisher = Copp C.

Recommended lengths are between 150 and 195 centimeters for adult skiers, depending on height and weight of the user.

Three classes of glide wax are available, depending on the level of desired performance with higher performance coming at higher cost.  Hydrocarbon glide waxes, based on [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] are common for recreational use.  Race waxes comprise a combination of fluorinated hydrocarbon waxes and fluorocarbon overlays.<ref>{{cite web | last = Harvey | first = Ian | title = Information on Fluorinated Waxes | work = A Michigan Nordic Ski Racer | date = 9 February 2011 | url = http://www.nordicskiracer.com/news.asp?NewsID=5429 | accessdate = 2014-10-21}}</ref>  Fluorocarbons decrease surface tension and surface area of the water between the ski and the snow, increasing speed and glide of the ski under specific conditions. Either combined with the wax or applied after in a spray, powder, or block form, fluorocarbons significantly improve the glide of the ski and are widely used in cross-country ski races.<ref>{{cite web | last = Swix | title = Information on Fluorinated Waxes | work = A Michigan Nordic Ski Racer | date = 22 February 2011\n | url = http://www.nordicskiracer.com/news.asp?NewsID=5482 | accessdate = 2014-10-21}}</ref>\n\n====Traction surface====\n{{main article|Ski wax#Grip wax}}\nSkis designed for classic technique, both in track and in virgin snow, rely on a traction zone, called the \"grip zone\" or \"kick zone\", underfoot. This comes either from a) ''texture'', designed to slide forward but not backwards, that is built into the grip zone of waxless skis, or from applied devices, e.g. climbing skins, or b) from ''grip waxes''. [[Ski wax#Grip wax|Grip waxes]] are classified according to their hardness: harder waxes are for colder and newer snow. An incorrect choice of grip wax for the snow conditions encountered may cause ski slippage (wax too hard for the conditions) or snow sticking to the grip zone (wax too soft for the conditions).<ref name=\"Rees\"/> Grip waxes generate grip by interacting with snow crystals, which vary with temperature, age and compaction.<ref name=\"Rees\"/> Hard grip waxes don't work well for snow which has metamorphosed to having coarse grains, whether icy or wet. In these conditions, skiers opt for a stickier substance, called ''klister''.<ref name=\"Rees\"/>\n\n===Boots and bindings===\n[[File:Cross-country ski boot and binding system--Classic.jpg|thumb|Cross-country ski boot and ''standardized'' binding system for classic skiing. The skier clicks the toe of the boot into the binding and releases with the button in front of the boot.]]\n[[Ski boots]] are attached to the ski only at the toe, leaving the heel free. Depending on application, boots may be lightweight (performance skiing) or heavier and more supportive (back-country skiing).<ref name=Boot-binding/>\n\n[[Ski binding|Bindings]] connect the boot to the ski. There are three primary groups of [[Nordic Integrated System|binding systems]] used in cross-country skiing (in descending order of importance):<ref name=Boot-binding>{{cite web | last = Dzierzak | first = Lou | title = Cross country skiers venture off track | department = On the Wild Side | work = Cross Country Skier Magazine | date = November 2008 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_nov/wild_side.htm | accessdate = 2014-10-21 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150302164504/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/magazine/08_nov/wild_side.htm | archivedate = 2 March 2015 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n* '''Standardized system''': Boots and bindings have an integrated connection, typically a bar across the front end of the sole of the boot, and platform on which the boot rests. Two families of standards prevail: NNN (New Nordic Norm) and SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil. Both systems have variants for skiing on groomed surfaces and in back country. These systems are the most common type of binding.\n* '''Three-pin''': The boot-gripping system comprises three pins that correspond to three holes in the sole of the boot's toe, used primarily for back-country skiing.\n* '''Cable''': A [[Cable binding|cable]] secures the free-moving heel and keeps the toe of the boot pushed into a boot-gripping section, used primarily for back-country and telemark skiing.\n\n===Poles===\n{{main article|Ski pole}}\nSki poles are used for balance and propulsion. Modern cross-country ski poles are made from [[aluminium]], [[fibreglass-reinforced plastic]], or [[carbon fibre]], depending on weight, cost and performance parameters. Formerly they were made of wood or [[bamboo]].  They feature a foot (called a basket) near the end of the shaft that provides a pushing platform, as it makes contact with the snow. Baskets vary in size, according to the expected softness/firmness of the snow. Racing poles feature smaller, lighter baskets than recreational poles. Poles designed for skating are longer than those designed for classic skiing.<ref name=pole>{{cite web | last = Hindman | first = Steve | title = Poling Principles | department = Training & Technique | work = Cross Country Skier | date = February 2004 | url = http://www.crosscountryskier.com/training_technique_feb_2004.html | accessdate = 2014-11-18 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024911/http://www.crosscountryskier.com/training_technique_feb_2004.html | archivedate = 29 November 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Traditional skiing in the 1800s used a single pole for both cross-country and downhill.

The first [[fireworks]] display occurred in 1976, sponsored by a hotel on the waterfront and this has been repeated ever since. In the 1990s the city saw it as a great opportunity to promote the city and organized and expanded the event.\n\nAn assessment made during the New Year's Eve 1992 highlighted the risks associated with increasing crowd numbers on Copacabana beach after the fireworks display. Since the 1993-94 event concerts have been held on the beach to retain the public. The result was a success with egress spaced out over a period of 2 hours without the previous turmoil, although critics claimed that it denied the spirit of the New Year's tradition of a religious festival with fireworks by the sea. The following year [[Rod Stewart]] beat attendance records. Finally, the Tribute to [[Tom Jobim]] - with [[Gal Costa]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Chico Buarque]], and [[Paulinho da Viola]] - consolidated the shows at the Copacabana [[R\u00e9veillon]].\n\nThere was a need to transform the fireworks display in a show of the same quality. The fireworks display was created by entrepreneurs Ricardo Amaral and Marius. From the previous 8\u201310 minutes the time was extended to 20 minutes and the quality and diversity of the fireworks was improved. A technical problem in fireworks 2000 required the use of ferries from New Year's Eve 2001-02. New Year's Eve has begun to compete with the [[Rio Carnival|Carnival]], and since 1992 it has been a tourist attraction in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodorio.com/a-histria-do-rveillon-de-copacabana/ |title=A Hist\u00f3ria do R\u00e9veillon de Copacabana |website=Diariodorio.com |date=2012-12-29 |accessdate=2016-05-25}}</ref>\n\n{{wide image|R\u00e8veillon 2013 (8333332944).jpg|800px|Fireworks in Copacabana.}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)}}\n* [http://copacabana.com/en/copahis1-i.shtml History of Copacabana (in English)]\n* [https://www.amazon.com/Copacabana-Series-Tropical-Crime-ebook/dp/B008AWX6ZQ Copacabana - Tropical Crime Noir]\n\n{{Rio de Janeiro city neighbourhoods}}\n\n[[Category:Copacabana| ]]\n[[Category:Beaches of Rio de Janeiro (city)]]\n[[Category:Neighbourhoods in Rio de Janeiro (city)]]\n[[Category:2016 Summer Olympic venues]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Rio de Janeiro (city)]]", "sha1": "pb4errfkna8dcr10tm2qfxqr3kym2x4"}}, {"title": "Cy Young Award", "ns": "0", "id": "6725", "revision": {"id": "864051713", "parentid": "864049613", "timestamp": "2018-10-14T19:53:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Muboshgu", "id": "602857"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 3 edits by [[Special:Contributions/72.47.128.83|72.47.128.83]] ([[User talk:72.47.128.83|talk]]) to last revision by KalHolmann.

Frick]] in honor of [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] pitcher [[Cy Young]], who died in 1955.<ref name=\"BASEALM\" /> The award would be given to pitchers only. Originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, the award changed its format over time. From 1956 to 1966, the award was given to one pitcher in Major League Baseball. After Frick retired in 1967, [[William Eckert]] became the new Commissioner of Baseball. Due to fan requests, Eckert announced that the Cy Young Award would be given out both in the [[American League]] and the [[National League]].<ref name=\"BASEALM\" /> From 1956 to 1958, a pitcher was not allowed to win the award on more than one occasion; this rule was eliminated in 1959. After a tie in the 1969 voting for the Cy Young Award, the process was changed, in which each writer was to vote for three different pitchers: the first-place vote received five points, the second-place vote received three points, and the third-place vote received one point.<ref name=\"BASEALM\" />\n\nThe first recipient of the Cy Young Award was [[Don Newcombe]] of the Dodgers. In 1957, [[Warren Spahn]] became the first left-handed pitcher to win the award. In 1963, [[Sandy Koufax]] became the first pitcher to win the award in a unanimous vote; two years later he became the first multiple winner. In 1978, [[Gaylord Perry]] (age 40) became the oldest pitcher to receive the award, a record that stood until broken in 2004 by [[Roger Clemens]] (age 42).<ref name=\"BASEALM\" /> The youngest recipient was [[Dwight Gooden]] (age 20 in 1985).

Comparably, Judaism suffered the setbacks of the [[Jewish\u2013Roman wars|Jewish-Roman wars]], remembered in the legacy of the [[Ten Martyrs]]. [[Robin Lane Fox]] traces the origin of much later hostility to the period of persecution, where the commonest test by the authorities of a suspected Christian was to require homage to be paid to the deified emperor. Jews were exempt from this requirement as long as they paid the [[Fiscus Judaicus]], and Christians (many or mostly of Jewish origins) would say they were Jewish but refused to pay the tax. This had to be confirmed by the local Jewish authorities, who were likely to refuse to accept the Christians as Jewish, often leading to their execution.<ref>In [https://books.google.com/books?id=bBqOAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&dq=%22Pagans+and+Christians%22+Robin+Lane+Fox&pgis=1 ''Pagans and Christians'']</ref> The [[Birkat haMinim]] was often brought forward as support for this charge that the Jews were responsible for the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In the 3rd century systematic persecution of Christians began and lasted until [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine]]'s conversion to Christianity.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} In 390 [[Theodosius I]] made Christianity the [[state church of the Roman Empire]]. While pagan cults and [[Manichaeism]] were suppressed, Judaism retained its legal status as a licit religion, though anti-Jewish violence still occurred. In the 5th century, some legal measures worsened the status of the [[Jews in the Roman Empire]] (now more properly called the [[Byzantine Empire]] since relocating to [[Constantinople]]).{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n==Issues arising from the New Testament==\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n===Jesus as the Messiah===\n{{See also|Judaism's view of Jesus|Rejection of Jesus}}\nJesus is rejected in [[Judaism]] as a failed [[Jewish Messiah claimants|Jewish Messiah claimant]] and a [[False_prophet#Judaism|false prophet]].<ref name=\"BergerDWyschogrodM\">{{cite book|last=Berger|first=David|title=Jews and \"Jewish Christianity\"|year=1978|publisher=KTAV Publ.

The most widely held explanation was that Jews had been the chosen people but broke the covenant with God, and were condemned to spend the rest of eternity suffering on earth, a symbol of degradation and sub-humanity.{{cn|date=April 2018}} It was because of this belief that many Medieval European rulers protected the Jews, but considered them property of the king.<ref name=\"The Butcher's Tale\">The Butcher's Tale</ref>\n\n===Criticism of the Pharisees===\n{{Main article|Woes of the Pharisees}}\nMany New Testament passages criticise the [[Pharisees]] and it has been argued that these passages have shaped the way that Christians viewed Jews. Like most Bible passages, however, they can and have been interpreted in a variety of ways.\n\nMainstream [[Talmud]]ic [[Rabbinical Judaism]] today directly descends from the Pharisees whom Jesus often criticized.<ref>Universal Jewish Encyclopedia (1943); Jewish Encyclopedia (1905), Exhibit 264.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12087-pharisees|title=PHARISEES - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}</ref> During Jesus' life and at the time of his execution, the Pharisees were only one of several Jewish groups such as the [[Sadducee]]s, [[Zealot]]s, and [[Essene]]s who mostly died out not long after the period;<ref>Jewish Encyclopedia (1905)</ref> indeed, Jewish scholars such as [[Harvey Falk]] and [[Hyam Maccoby]] have suggested that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. Arguments by Jesus and his disciples against the Pharisees and what he saw as their hypocrisy were most likely examples of disputes among Jews and internal to Judaism that were common at the time, see for example [[Hillel and Shammai]].\n\n===Recent studies on antisemitism in the New Testament===\nProfessor Lillian C. Freudmann, author of ''Antisemitism in the New Testament'' ([[University Press of America]], 1994) has published a detailed study of the description of Jews in the New Testament, and the historical effects that such passages have had in the Christian community throughout history. Similar studies of such verses have been made by both Christian and Jewish scholars, including, Professors Clark Williamsom (Christian Theological Seminary), [[Hyam Maccoby]] (The Leo Baeck Institute), Norman A. Beck (Texas Lutheran College), and Michael Berenbaum (Georgetown University). Most rabbis feel that these verses are antisemitic, and many Christian scholars, in America and Europe, have reached the same conclusion. Another example is [[John Dominic Crossan]]'s 1995 ''Who Killed Jesus? Exposing the Roots of Anti-Semitism in the Gospel Story of the Death of Jesus''.\n\nSome biblical scholars have also been accused of holding antisemitic beliefs. [[Bruce J. Malina]], founding member of [[The Context Group]], has come under criticism for going as far as to deny the Semitic ancestry of modern Israelis. He then ties this back to his work on first century cultural anthropology.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Myles|first=Robert|author2=James Crossley |title=Biblical Scholarship, Jews and Israel: On Bruce Malina, Conspiracy Theories and Ideological Contradictions|journal=The Bible and Interpretation|date=Dec 2012|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/opeds/myl368013.shtml}}</ref>\n\n==Church Fathers==\n<!--{{Main article|Antisemitism in patristics}}-->\n{{see|Adversus Judaeos|John Chrysostom}}\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\nAfter [[Saint Paul|Paul]]'s death, Christianity emerged as a separate religion, and [[Pauline Christianity]] emerged as the dominant form of Christianity, especially after Paul, James and the other apostles agreed on a compromise set of requirements.{{Bibleref2c|Acts|15}} Some Christians continued to adhere to aspects of Jewish law, but they were few in number and often considered [[Christian heresy|heretics]] by the Church. One example is the [[Ebionites]], who seem to have denied the [[Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine)|virgin birth]] of Jesus, the physical [[Resurrection of Jesus]], and most of the books that were later [[biblical canon|canonized]] as the [[New Testament]].

The Catholic editor Paul Harkins wrote that [[St. John Chrysostom]]'s anti-Jewish theology \"is no longer tenable (..) For these objectively unchristian acts he cannot be excused, even if he is the product of his times.\" John Chrysostom held, as most Church Fathers did, that the sins of all Jews were communal and endless, to him his Jewish neighbours were the collective representation of all alleged crimes of all preexisting Jews. All Church Fathers applied the passages of the New Testament concerning the alleged advocation of the crucifixion of Christ to all Jews of his day, the Jews were the ultimate evil. However, John Chrysostom went so far to say that because Jews rejected the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]] in human flesh, Christ, they therefore deserved to be killed: \"grew fit for slaughter.\" In citing the New Testament,{{Bibleref2c|Luke|19:27}} he claimed that Jesus was speaking about Jews when he said, \"as for these enemies of mine who did not want me to reign over them, bring them here and ''slay them'' before me.\"<ref name=RobertM11/>\n\n[[St. Jerome]] identified Jews with [[Judas Iscariot]] and the immoral use of money (\"Judas is cursed, that in Judas the Jews may be accursed... their prayers turn into sins\"). Jerome's homiletical assaults, that may have served as the basis for the anti-Jewish [[Good Friday prayer for the Jews|Good Friday liturgy]], contrasts Jews with the evil, and that \"the ceremonies of the Jews are harmful and deadly to Christians\", whoever keeps them was doomed to the [[devil]]: \"My enemies are the Jews; they have conspired in hatred against Me, crucified Me, heaped evils of all kinds upon Me, blasphemed Me.\"<ref name=RobertM11/>\n\n[[Ephraim the Syrian]] wrote polemics against Jews in the 4th century, including the repeated accusation that Satan dwells among them as a partner. The writings were directed at Christians who were being proselytized by Jews. Ephraim feared that they were slipping back into Judaism; thus, he portrayed the Jews as enemies of Christianity, like Satan, to emphasize the contrast between the two religions, namely, that Christianity was Godly and true and Judaism was Satanic and false. Like John Chrysostom, his objective was to dissuade Christians from reverting to Judaism by emphasizing what he saw as the wickedness of the Jews and their religion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol1No2/HV1N2Palmer.html |title=Ephraim the Syrian and his polemics against Jews |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://syrcom.cua.edu/Hugoye/Vol5No1/HV5N1Shepardson.html |title=Analysis of Ephraim's writings |publisher=Syrcom.cua.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\nHowever, there are also positive remarks from the Church Fathers on the issue, such as [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] (circa. 263-340 A.D) in his Ecclesiastical History, who said, \"The race of the Hebrews is not new, but is honoured among all men for its antiquity and is itself well known to all.\"\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{Main article|Medieval antisemitism}}\n[[File:1182 french expulsion of jews.jpg|thumb|A miniature from [[Grandes Chroniques de France]] depicting the expulsion of Jews from France in 1182.]]\n[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] (1090-1153), a Doctor of the Catholic Church, said \"For us the Jews are Scripture's living words, because they remind us of what Our Lord suffered.

Jews were excluded from many trades, the occupations varying with place and time, and determined by the influence of various non-Jewish competing interests. Often Jews were barred from all occupations but money-lending and peddling, with even these at times forbidden. Jews' association to money lending would carry on throughout history in the stereotype of Jews being greedy and perpetuating capitalism.\n\nIn the later medieval period, the number of Jews permitted to reside in certain places was limited; they were concentrated in [[ghetto]]s, and were not allowed to own land; they were subject to discriminatory taxes on entering cities or districts other than their own,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\nThe [[Oath More Judaico]], the form of oath required from Jewish witnesses, in some places developed bizarre or humiliating forms, e.g. in Swabian law of the 13th century,  the Jew would be required to stand on the hide of a sow or a bloody lamb.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nThe [[Fourth Lateran Council]] in 1215 was the first to proclaim the requirement for Jews to wear something that distinguished them as Jews (and Muslims the same).\nOn many occasions, Jews were accused of a [[blood libel]], the supposed drinking of blood of Christian children in mockery of the Christian [[Eucharist]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/972200793|title=Ritual murder in Russia, Eastern Europe, and beyond : new histories of an old accusation|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Avrutin, Eugene M.,, Dekel-Chen, Jonathan L.,, Weinberg, Robert,|year=|isbn=9780253026576|location=Bloomington, Indiana|pages=39\u201340|oclc=972200793}}</ref>\n\n===''Sicut Judaeis''===\n''[[Sicut Judaeis]]'' (the \"Constitution for the Jews\") was the official position of the papacy regarding Jews throughout the Middle Ages and later.

In the case of blood libel it was widely believed that the Jews would kill a child before Easter and needed Christian blood to bake matzo.Throughout history if a Christian child was murdered accusations of blood libel would arise no matter how small the Jewish population.

There were particular outbursts of riotous persecution during the [[Rhineland massacres]] of 1096 in Germany accompanying the lead-up to the [[First Crusade]], many involving the crusaders as they travelled to the East. There were many local expulsions from cities by local rulers and city councils.  In Germany the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] generally tried to restrain persecution, if only for economic reasons, but he was often unable to exert much influence.  In the [[Edict of Expulsion]], [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] expelled all the Jews from England in 1290 (only after ransoming some 3,000 among the most wealthy of them), on the accusation of [[usury]] and undermining loyalty to the dynasty.

While some converted, many others left for [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]] (including the [[Papal States]]), [[Netherlands]], [[Poland]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and [[North Africa]].

The Ghetto was a walled quarter with three gates that were locked at night. Jews were also restricted to one [[synagogue]] per city.\n\nPaul IV's successor, [[Pope Pius IV]], enforced the creation of other ghettos in most Italian towns, and his successor, [[Pope Pius V]], recommended them to other bordering states.\n\n===Protestant Reformation===\n[[File:1543 On the Jews and Their Lies by Martin Luther.jpg|thumb|Luther's 1543 pamphlet ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies (Martin Luther)|On the Jews and Their Lies]]'']]\n{{See also|Luther and antisemitism}}\n\n[[Martin Luther]] at first made overtures towards the Jews, believing that the \"evils\" of [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]] had prevented their conversion to Christianity.

Brown University historian [[David Kertzer]], working from the Vatican archive, has argued in his book ''[[The Popes Against the Jews]]'' that in the 19th and early 20th centuries the Roman Catholic Church adhered to a distinction between \"good antisemitism\" and \"bad antisemitism\". The \"bad\" kind promoted hatred of Jews because of their descent. This was considered un-Christian because the Christian message was intended for all of humanity regardless of ethnicity; anyone could become a Christian. The \"good\" kind criticized alleged [[Jewish conspiracy|Jewish conspiracies]] to control newspapers, banks, and other institutions, to care only about accumulation of wealth, etc. Many Catholic bishops wrote articles criticizing Jews on such grounds, and, when they were accused of promoting hatred of Jews, they would remind people that they condemned the \"bad\" kind of antisemitism. Kertzer's work is not without critics. Scholar of Jewish-Christian relations [[Rabbi David G.

Too many Christians participated in, or were sympathetic to, Nazi atrocities against Jews. Other Christians did not protest sufficiently against these atrocities.

The line of \"antisemitic descent\" from Luther, the author of ''[[On the Jews and Their Lies]]'', to Hitler is \"easy to draw.\" In her ''[[The War Against the Jews]], 1933-1945'', she contends that Luther and Hitler were obsessed by the \"demonologized universe\" inhabited by Jews. Dawidowicz writes that the similarities between Luther's anti-Jewish writings and modern antisemitism are no coincidence, because they derived from a common history of ''Judenhass'', which can be traced to [[Haman (Bible)|Haman's]] advice to [[Ahasuerus]]. Although modern German antisemitism also has its roots in German [[nationalism]] and the [[liberalism|liberal]] revolution of 1848, [[Christianity|Christian]] antisemitism she writes is a foundation that was laid by the [[Roman Catholic]] Church and \"upon which Luther built.\"<ref name=Dawidowicz>Lucy Dawidowicz ''The War Against the Jews, 1933-1945''.

They claim that their antisemitism is based on purported Jewish control of the media, international banks, radical [[left-wing politics]], and the Jews' promotion of [[multiculturalism]], anti-Christian groups, [[liberalism]] and perverse organizations. They rebuke charges of [[racism]] and claim that Jews who share their ideology maintain membership in their organizations. A racial belief common among these groups, but not universal among them, is an [[Historical revisionism (political)|alternative history]] doctrine, which is sometimes called [[British Israelism]]. In some of its forms, this doctrine absolutely denies the view that modern Jews have any racial connection to the [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|Israel of the Bible]]. Instead, according to extreme forms of this doctrine, the true racial Israel and the true humans are the members of the Adamic ([[white people|white]]) race.

For example, the influential evangelical preacher [[Billy Graham]] and then-president [[Richard Nixon]] were captured on tape in the early 1970s discussing matters like how to address the [[Antisemitic canard#Accusations of controlling the media|Jews' control]] of the [[Media of the United States|American media]].<ref name=\"bbcregret\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1850077.stm \"Graham regrets Jewish slur\"], [[BBC]], March 2, 2002.</ref><ref name=\"newsweek1\">{{cite news |title=Pilgrim's Progress, p. 5 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/46365/page/5 |publisher=''Newsweek'' |date=August 14, 2006 |accessdate=September 20, 2008}}</ref> This belief in Jewish conspiracies and domination of the media was similar to those of Graham's former mentors: [[William Bell Riley]] chose Graham to succeed him as the second president of Northwestern Bible and Missionary Training School and evangelist [[Mordecai Ham]] led the meetings where Graham first believed in Christ.

Under this approach, anti-Judaism is not regarded as antisemitism as it only rejects the religious ideas of Judaism and does not involve actual hostility to the Jewish people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nOthers see anti-Judaism as the rejection of or opposition to beliefs and practices ''essentially because'' of their source in [[Judaism]] or because a belief or practice is associated with the Jewish people. (But see [[supersessionism]])\n\nThe position that \"Christian theological anti-Judaism is a phenomenon distinct from modern antisemitism, which is rooted in economic and racial thought, so that Christian teachings should not be held responsible for antisemitism\"<ref name=\"Susannah_Heschel_2008\"/> has been articulated, among other places, by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 'We Remember: A Reflection on the [[Shoah]],' and the Jewish declaration on Christianity, [[Dabru Emet]].<ref name=\"Susannah_Heschel_2008\"/> Several scholars, including Susannah Heschel,<ref name=\"Susannah_Heschel_2008\"/> Gavin I Langmuir<ref name=\"langmuir_1990\">Langmuir, AvGavin I., [https://books.google.com/books?id=F1ySMxcXkjIC History, Religion, and Antisemitism], p. 40, University of California Press, 1990</ref> and Uriel Tal<ref name=\"Susannah_Heschel_2008\"/> have challenged this position, arguing that anti-Judaism led directly to modern antisemitism.\n\nAlthough some Christians in the past did consider anti-Judaism to be contrary to Christian teaching, this view was not widely expressed by leaders and lay people. In many cases, the practical tolerance towards the Jewish religion and Jews prevailed. Some Christian groups, particularly in early years, condemned verbal anti-Judaism.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}\n\n==Jewish converts==\n{{See also|Messianic Judaism|Jews for Jesus}}\nThe [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (SBC), the largest Protestant Christian denomination in the U.S., has explicitly rejected suggestions that it should back away from seeking to convert Jews, a position which critics have called antisemitic, but a position which [[Baptists]] believe is consistent with their view that salvation is found solely through faith in Christ. In 1996 the SBC approved a resolution calling for efforts to seek the conversion of Jews \"as well as for the salvation of 'every kindred and tongue and people and nation.'\"\n\nMost [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] agree with the SBC's position, and some support efforts which specifically seek the Jews' conversion. At the same time these Evangelical groups are among the most pro-Israel groups. (''For more information, see [[Christian Zionism]]''.) Among the [[Messianic Judaism|controversial groups]] that have found support from some Evangelical churches is [[Jews for Jesus]], which claims that Jews can \"complete\" their Jewish faith by accepting Jesus as the Messiah.\n\nThe [[Presbyterian Church USA|Presbyterian Church (USA)]], the [[United Methodist Church]], and the [[United Church of Canada]] have ended their efforts to convert Jews. While [[Anglicans]] do not, as a rule, seek converts from other Christian denominations,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/news.cfm/2003/5/20/ACNS3443 |title=Anglican Communion News Service: European Anglicans set common goals at Madrid consultation |publisher=Anglicancommunion.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref> the General Synod has affirmed that \"the good news of salvation in Jesus Christ is for all and must be shared with all including people from other faiths or of no faith and that to do anything else would be to institutionalize discrimination\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Owen |first=Peter |url=http://www.thinkinganglicans.org.uk/archives/003647.html |title=General Synod - Uniqueness of Christ in Multi-Faith Britain |publisher=Thinking Anglicans |date=2009-02-11 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] formerly had religious congregations specifically aimed at the conversion of Jews. Some of these were founded by Jewish converts themselves, like the [[Congregation of Our Lady of Sion]], which was composed of [[nun]]s and ordained [[priest]]s. Many Catholic saints were noted specifically because of their missionary zeal in converting Jews, such as [[Vincent Ferrer]]. After the [[Second Vatican Council]] many missionary orders aimed at converting Jews to Christianity no longer actively sought to missionize (or [[proselytism|proselytize]]) among Jews. [[Traditionalist Catholic|Traditionalist Roman Catholic]] groups, congregations and clergymen, however, continue to support missionizing Jews according to traditional patterns, sometimes with success (''e.g.'', the [[Society of St. Pius X]] which has notable Jewish converts among its faithful, many of whom have become traditionalist priests).\n\nSome Jewish organizations have described evangelism and missionary activity directed specifically at Jews as [[antisemitic]].<ref>[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/jews_for_jesus/jews_for_jesus6.html Keeping Faith.

It was developed for the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) from the 1980s to the early 1990s by [[McDonnell Douglas]]. The C-17 carries forward the name of two previous piston-engined military cargo aircraft, the [[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]] and the [[Douglas C-124 Globemaster II]]. The C-17 commonly performs tactical and [[airlift#Strategic airlift|strategic airlift]] missions, transporting troops and cargo throughout the world; additional roles include [[medical evacuation]] and [[airdrop]] duties. It was designed to replace the [[Lockheed C-141 Starlifter]], and also fulfill some of the duties of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], freeing the C-5 fleet for [[outsize cargo]].<ref name=norton_p12-3/>\n\n[[Boeing]], which merged with McDonnell Douglas in 1997, continued to manufacture C-17s for export customers following the end of deliveries to the U.S. Air Force. Aside from the United States, the C-17 is in service with the [[Royal Air Force|United Kingdom]], [[Royal Australian Air Force|Australia]], [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Canada]], [[Qatar Emiri Air Force|Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates Air Force|United Arab Emirates]], [[NATO]] [[Heavy Airlift Wing]], [[Indian Air Force|India]], and [[Kuwait Air Force|Kuwait]].

Compounding matters, USAF needed increased strategic airlift capabilities to fulfill its rapid-deployment airlift requirements. The USAF set mission requirements and released a request for proposals (RFP) for C-X in October 1980. McDonnell Douglas elected to develop a new aircraft based on the YC-15. Boeing bid an enlarged three-engine version of its AMST YC-14. Lockheed submitted two designs, a C-5-based design and an enlarged C-141 design. On 28 August 1981, McDonnell Douglas was chosen to build its proposed aircraft, then designated ''C-17''. Compared to the YC-15, the new aircraft differed in having swept wings, increased size, and more powerful engines.<ref name=norton_p12-3>Norton 2001, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>  This would allow it to perform the work done by the C-141, and to fulfill some of the duties of the [[Lockheed C-5 Galaxy]], freeing the C-5 fleet for [[outsize cargo]].<ref name=norton_p12-3/>\n\nAlternative proposals were pursued to fill airlift needs after the C-X contest. These were lengthening of C-141As into C-141Bs, ordering more C-5s, continued purchases of [[McDonnell Douglas KC-10 Extender|KC-10]]s, and expansion of the [[Civil Reserve Air Fleet]]. Limited budgets reduced program funding, requiring a delay of four years.

The ''garbage collector'', or just ''collector'', attempts to reclaim ''[[garbage (computer science)|garbage]]'', or memory occupied by [[object (computer science)|objects]] that are no longer in use by the [[application software|program]]. Garbage collection was invented by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] around 1959 to simplify manual memory management in [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=367177.367199 |title=Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine, Part I |publisher=Portal.acm.org |accessdate=29 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html|title=Recursive functions of symbolic expressions and their computation by machine, Part I |accessdate=29 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nGarbage collection is essentially the opposite of [[manual memory management]], which requires the programmer to specify which objects to deallocate and return to the memory system. However, many systems use a combination of approaches, including other techniques such as [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack allocation]] and [[region inference]]. Like other memory management techniques, garbage collection may take a significant proportion of total processing time in a program and, as a result, can have significant influence on performance. With good implementations and with enough memory, depending on application, garbage collection can be faster than manual memory management, while the opposite can also be true and has often been the case in the past with sub-optimal GC algorithms.\n\nResources other than memory, such as [[network socket]]s, database [[handle (computing)|handle]]s, [[window (computing)|user interaction window]]s, and [[file (computing)|file]] and device descriptors, are not typically handled by garbage collection. [[Method (computer programming)|Methods]] used to manage such resources, particularly [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]], may suffice to manage memory as well, leaving no need for GC. Some GC systems allow such other resources to be associated with a region of memory that, when collected, causes the resource to be reclaimed; this is called [[finalizer|''finalization'']]. Finalization may introduce complications limiting its usability, such as intolerable latency between disuse and reclaim of especially limited resources, or a lack of control over which [[thread (computing)|thread]] performs the work of reclaiming.\n\n== Principles ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2014}}\n\nThe basic principles of garbage collection are to find data objects in a program that cannot be accessed in the future, and to reclaim the resources used by those objects.\n\nMany [[programming language]]s require garbage collection, either as part of the [[language specification]] (for example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dlang.org/overview.html |title=Overview&nbsp;\u2014 D Programming Language |website=dlang.org |publisher=Digital Mars |accessdate=2014-07-29 }}</ref> [[Go (programming language)|Go]] and most [[scripting language]]s) or effectively for practical implementation (for example, formal languages like [[lambda calculus]]); these are said to be ''garbage collected languages''. Other languages were designed for use with manual memory management, but have garbage-collected implementations available (for example, [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]). Some languages, like [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Modula-3]], and [[C++/CLI]], allow both garbage collection and [[manual memory management]] to co-exist in the same application by using separate [[Heap (data structure)|heaps]] for collected and manually managed objects; others, like [[D (programming language)|D]], are garbage-collected but allow the user to manually delete objects and also entirely disable garbage collection when speed is required.\n\nWhile integrating garbage collection into the language's [[compiler]] and [[runtime system]] enables a much wider choice of methods,{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} ''post-hoc'' GC systems exist, such as [[Automatic Reference Counting]] (ARC), including some that do not require recompilation. (''Post-hoc'' GC is sometimes distinguished as ''litter collection''.) The garbage collector will almost always be closely integrated with the [[dynamic memory allocation|memory allocator]].\n\n=== Advantages ===\nGarbage collection frees the programmer from manually dealing with memory deallocation. As a result, certain categories of [[bug (software)|bug]]s are eliminated or substantially reduced:\n\n* ''[[Dangling pointer]] bugs'', which occur when a piece of memory is freed while there are still [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]]s to it, and one of those pointers is [[Dereference_operator|dereferenced]]. By then the memory may have been reassigned to another use, with unpredictable results.\n* ''Double free bugs'', which occur when the program tries to free a region of memory that has already been freed, and perhaps already been allocated again.\n* Certain kinds of ''[[memory leak]]s'', in which a program fails to free memory occupied by objects that have become [[unreachable]], which can lead to memory exhaustion. (Garbage collection typically{{who|date=June 2018}} does not deal with the unbounded accumulation of data that is reachable, but that will actually not be used by the program.)\n* Efficient implementations of [[persistent data structure]]s\n\nSome of the bugs addressed by garbage collection have security implications.\n\n=== Disadvantages ===\nTypically, garbage collection has certain disadvantages, including consuming additional resources, performance impacts, possible stalls in program execution, and incompatibility with manual resource management.\n\nGarbage collection consumes computing resources in deciding which memory to free, even though the programmer may have already known this information. The penalty for the convenience of not annotating object lifetime manually in the source code is [[overhead (computing)|overhead]], which can lead to decreased or uneven performance.<ref name=\"zorn1993\">{{cite paper|citeseerx=10.1.1.14.1816 |first=Benjamin |last=Zorn |title=The Measured Cost of Conservative Garbage Collection |publisher=Department of Computer Science, [[University of Colorado Boulder]] |date=1993-01-22}}</ref> A peer-reviewed paper came to the conclusion that GC needs five times the memory to compensate for this overhead and to perform as fast as explicit memory management.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://people.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/gcvsmalloc.pdf |title=Quantifying the Performance of Garbage Collection vs. Explicit Memory Management |author1=Matthew Hertz|author2= Emery D.

Unpredictable stalls can be unacceptable in [[real-time computing|real-time environments]], in [[transaction processing]], or in interactive programs. Incremental, concurrent, and real-time garbage collectors address these problems, with varying trade-offs.\n\nThe modern GC implementations try to minimize blocking \"[[stop-the-world]]\" stalls by doing as much work as possible on the background (i.e. on a separate thread), for example marking unreachable garbage instances while the application process continues to run. In spite of these advancements, for example in the [[Common Language Runtime|.NET CLR paradigm]] it is still very difficult to maintain large heaps (millions of objects) with resident objects that get promoted to older generations without incurring noticeable delays (sometimes a few seconds).\n\nNon-deterministic GC is incompatible with [[resource acquisition is initialization]] (RAII) based management of non-GCed resources{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}. As a result, the need for explicit manual resource management (release/close) for non-GCed resources becomes transitive to composition. That is: in a non-deterministic GC system, if a resource or a resource-like object requires manual resource management (release/close), and this object is used as \"part of\" another object, then the composed object will also become a resource-like object that itself requires manual resource management (release/close).\n\n== Strategies ==\n\n=== Tracing ===\n{{Main|Tracing garbage collection}}\n\n[[Tracing garbage collection]] is the most common type of garbage collection, so much so that \"garbage collection\" often refers to tracing garbage collection, rather than other methods such as [[reference counting]]. The overall strategy consists of determining which objects should be garbage collected by tracing which objects are ''reachable'' by a chain of references from certain root objects, and considering the rest as garbage and collecting them. However, there are a large number of algorithms used in implementation, with widely varying complexity and performance characteristics.\n\n=== Reference counting ===\n{{Main|Reference counting}}\n\nReference counting garbage collection is where each object has a count of the number of references to it. Garbage is identified by having a reference count of zero. An object's reference count is incremented when a reference to it is created, and decremented when a reference is destroyed. When the count reaches zero, the object's memory is reclaimed. <ref>[https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/abhinaba/2009/01/27/back-to-basics-reference-counting-garbage-collection/ Reference Counting Garbage Collection]</ref>\n\nAs with manual memory management, and unlike tracing garbage collection, reference counting guarantees that objects are destroyed as soon as their last reference is destroyed, and usually only accesses memory which is either in CPU caches, in objects to be freed, or directly pointed by those, and thus tends to not have significant negative side effects on CPU cache and virtual memory operation.\n\nThere are a number of disadvantages to reference counting; this can generally be solved or mitigated by more sophisticated algorithms:\n\n; Cycles: If two or more objects refer to each other, they can create a cycle whereby neither will be collected as their mutual references never let their reference counts become zero. Some garbage collection systems using reference counting (like the one in [[CPython]]) use specific cycle-detecting algorithms to deal with this issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/release/2.5.2/ext/refcounts.html|accessdate=22 May 2014|date=21 February 2008|title=Reference Counts|work=Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter }}</ref> Another strategy is to use [[weak reference]]s for the \"backpointers\" which create cycles. Under reference counting, a weak reference is similar to a weak reference under a tracing garbage collector. It is a special reference object whose existence does not increment the reference count of the referent object. Furthermore, a weak reference is safe in that when the referent object becomes garbage, any weak reference to it ''lapses'', rather than being permitted to remain dangling, meaning that it turns into a predictable value, such as a null reference.\n; Space overhead (reference count): Reference counting requires space to be allocated for each object to store its reference count. The count may be stored adjacent to the object's memory or in a side table somewhere else, but in either case, every single reference-counted object requires additional storage for its reference count. Memory space with the size of an unsigned pointer is commonly used for this task, meaning that 32 or 64 bits of reference count storage must be allocated for each object. On some systems, it may be possible to mitigate this overhead by using a [[tagged pointer]] to store the reference count in unused areas of the object's memory. Often, an architecture does not actually allow programs to access the full range of memory addresses that could be stored in its native pointer size; certain number of high bits in the address is either ignored or required to be zero. If an object reliably has a pointer at a certain location, the reference count can be stored in the unused bits of the pointer. For example, each object in [[Objective-C]] has a pointer to its [[class (computer programming)|class]] at the beginning of its memory; on the [[ARM64]] architecture using [[iOS 7]], 19 unused bits of this class pointer are used to store the object's reference count.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mike Ash |url=https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/friday-qa-2013-09-27-arm64-and-you.html |title=Friday Q&A 2013-09-27: ARM64 and You |publisher=mikeash.com |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sealiesoftware.com/blog/archive/2013/09/24/objc_explain_Non-pointer_isa.html |title=Hamster Emporium: [objc explain&#93;: Non-pointer isa |publisher=Sealiesoftware.com |date=2013-09-24 |accessdate=2014-04-27}}</ref>\n; Speed overhead (increment/decrement): In naive implementations, each assignment of a reference and each reference falling out of scope often require modifications of one or more reference counters. However, in the common case, when a reference is copied from an outer scope variable into an inner scope variable, such that the lifetime of the inner variable is bounded by the lifetime of the outer one, the reference incrementing can be eliminated. The outer variable \"owns\" the reference. In the programming language C++, this technique is readily implemented and demonstrated with the use of <code>const</code> references. Reference counting in C++ is usually implemented using \"[[smart pointer]]s\"<ref>[http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/10141/RAII-Dynamic-Objects-and-Factories-in-C#1 RAII, Dynamic Objects, and Factories in C++, Roland Pibinger, 3 May 2005]</ref> whose constructors, destructors and assignment operators manage the references. A smart pointer can be passed by reference to a function, which avoids the need to copy-construct a new smart pointer (which would increase the reference count on entry into the function and decrease it on exit). Instead the function receives a reference to the smart pointer which is produced inexpensively.\n; Requires atomicity: When used in a [[thread (computing)|multithreaded]] environment, these modifications (increment and decrement) may need to be [[atomic operation]]s such as [[compare-and-swap]], at least for any objects which are shared, or potentially shared among multiple threads. Atomic operations are expensive on a multiprocessor, and even more expensive if they have to be emulated with software algorithms. It is possible to avoid this issue by adding per-thread or per-CPU reference counts and only accessing the global reference count when the local reference counts become or are no longer zero (or, alternatively, using a binary tree of reference counts, or even giving up deterministic destruction in exchange for not having a global reference count at all), but this adds significant memory overhead and thus tends to be only useful in special cases (it is used, for example, in the reference counting of Linux kernel modules).\n; Not real-time: Naive implementations of reference counting do not in general provide real-time behavior, because any pointer assignment can potentially cause a number of objects bounded only by total allocated memory size to be recursively freed while the thread is unable to perform other work. It is possible to avoid this issue by delegating the freeing of objects whose reference count dropped to zero to other threads, at the cost of extra overhead.\n\n=== Escape analysis ===\n{{Main|Escape analysis}}\n\n[[Escape analysis]] can be used to convert [[heap allocation]]s to [[stack allocation]]s, thus reducing the amount of work needed to be done by the garbage collector. This is done using a compile-time analysis to determine whether an object allocated within a function is not accessible outside of it (i.e. escape) to other functions or threads. In such a case the object may be allocated directly on the thread stack and released when the function returns, reducing its potential garbage collection overhead.\n\n== Availability ==\nGenerally speaking, [[high-level programming language|higher-level programming languages]] are more likely to have garbage collection as a standard feature. In some languages that do not have built in garbage collection, it can be added through a library, as with the [[Boehm garbage collector]] for C and C++.\n\nMost [[functional programming language]]s, such as [[ML (programming language)|ML]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and [[APL (programming language)|APL]], have garbage collection built in. [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] is especially notable as both the first [[functional programming language]] and the first language to introduce garbage collection.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1671639|title=Influential Programming Languages, Part 4: Lisp|last=Chisnall|first=David|date=2011-01-12}}</ref>\n\nOther dynamic languages, such as [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[Julia (programming language)|Julia]] (but not [[Perl]]&nbsp;5 or [[PHP]] before version 5.3,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://php.net/manual/en/features.gc.performance-considerations.php |title=PHP: Performance Considerations |website=php.net |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> which both use reference counting), [[JavaScript]] and [[ECMAScript]] also tend to use GC. [[Object-oriented programming]] languages such as [[Smalltalk]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] usually provide integrated garbage collection. Notable exceptions are [[C++]] and [[Embarcadero Delphi|Delphi]] which have [[destructor (computer science)|destructors]].\n\n=== BASIC ===\nHistorically, languages intended for beginners, such as [[BASIC]] and [[Logo (programming language)|Logo]], have often used garbage collection for heap-allocated variable-length data types, such as strings and lists, so as not to burden programmers with manual memory management. On early microcomputers, with their limited memory and slow processors, BASIC garbage collection could often cause apparently random, inexplicable pauses in the midst of program operation.\n\nSome BASIC interpreters, such as [[Applesoft BASIC]] on the Apple II family, repeatedly scanned the string descriptors for the string having the highest address in order to compact it toward high memory, resulting in [[Big O notation|O(n<sup>2</sup>)]] performance, which could introduce minutes-long pauses in the execution of string-intensive programs. A replacement garbage collector for Applesoft BASIC published in [[Call-A.P.P.L.E.]] (January 1981, pages 40\u201345, [[Randy Wigginton]]) identified a group of strings in every pass over the heap, which cut collection time dramatically. BASIC.System, released with [[ProDOS]] in 1983, provided a windowing garbage collector for BASIC that reduced most collections to a fraction of a second.\n\n=== Objective-C ===\nWhile the [[Objective-C]] traditionally had no garbage collection, with the release of [[OS&nbsp;X 10.5]] in 2007 [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced garbage collection for [[Objective-C]]&nbsp;2.0, using an in-house developed runtime collector.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100724195423/http://developer.apple.com/leopard/overview/objectivec2.html Objective-C 2.0 Overview]</ref>\nHowever, with the 2012 release of [[OS&nbsp;X 10.8]], garbage collection was deprecated in favor of [[LLVM]]'s [[Automatic Reference Counting|automatic reference counter]] (ARC) that was introduced with [[OS&nbsp;X 10.7]].<ref>[https://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7/11/ Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: the Ars Technica review] John Siracusa (20 Juli 2011)</ref> Furthermore, since May 2015 Apple even forbids the usage of garbage collection for new OS&nbsp;X applications in the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].<ref name=\"Appleinsider2015\"/><ref name=\"heiseMacOSARC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/App-Store-Apple-entfernt-Programme-mit-Garbage-Collection-2557111.html |title=App Store: Apple entfernt Programme mit Garbage Collection |date=2015-02-21 |accessdate=2015-03-30 |publisher=[[Heise.de]] |first=Waldemar |last=Cichon}}</ref> For [[iOS]], garbage collection has never been introduced due to problems in application responsivity and performance;<ref name=\"wwdc2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.ibtimes.com/ios-8-vs-android-50-lollipop-apple-kills-google-memory-efficiency-1389704/|title=iOS 8 vs Android 5.0 Lollipop: Apple Kills Google with Memory Efficiency |first=Precious |last=Silva |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |accessdate=2015-04-07|date=2014-11-18}}</ref> instead, iOS uses ARC.<ref name=\"iosARC\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=-vg0Xe80W4oC&lpg=PT83&ots=RuIUH9C0oK&dq=arc%20runtime%20garbage%20collection&hl=de&pg=PT83#v=onepage&q=arc%20runtime%20garbage%20collection&f=false |title=iOS 6 Programming Pushing the Limit |author=Rob Napier, Mugunth Kumar |accessdate=2015-03-30 |date=2012-11-20 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]}}</ref><ref name=\"DrDobbsARC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/mobile/automatic-reference-counting-on-ios/240000820 |title=Automatic Reference Counting on iOS |first=Jos\u00e9 R.C. |last=Cruz |date=2012-05-22 |publisher=[[Dr. Dobbs]] |accessdate=2015-03-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Limited environments ===\n\nGarbage collection is rarely used on [[embedded computing|embedded]] or real-time systems because of the perceived need for very tight control over the use of limited resources.

When it becomes half full, a garbage collection is performed which moves the live objects into the other half and the remaining objects are implicitly deallocated. The running program (the 'mutator') has to check that any object it references is in the correct half, and if not move it across, while a background task is finding all of the objects.<ref>Baker, H.G.

One canid, the domestic dog, long ago entered into a partnership with humans and today remains one of the most widely kept domestic animals.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\nIn the history of the carnivores, the family Canidae is represented by the two extinct [[subfamily|subfamilies]] designated as [[Hesperocyoninae]] and [[Borophaginae]], and the extant subfamily [[Caninae]].<ref name=miklosi2015/> This subfamily includes all living canids and their most recent fossil relatives.<ref name=tedford2009/> All living canids as a group form a dental [[monophyletic]] relationship with the extinct borophagines with both groups having a [[bicuspid]] (two points) on the lower [[carnassial]] [[talonid]], which gives this tooth an additional ability in [[mastication]]. This together with the development of a distinct [[Glossary of mammalian dental topography#Lower teeth|entoconid]] cusp and the broadening of the talonid of the first lower [[molar (tooth)|molar]], and the corresponding enlargement of the talon of the upper first molar and reduction of its [[Glossary of mammalian dental topography#Upper teeth|parastyle]] distinguish these late [[Cenozoic]] canids and are the essential differences that identify their clade.<ref name=tedford2009/>{{rp|p6}}\n\n=== Phylogenetic relationships ===\n[[File:Indian Wolf Photo Dhaval Vargiya.jpg|thumb|Indian Wolf at Velavadar (Blackbuck National Park, Gujarat)]]\n[[File:MSU V2P1a - Vulpes, Nyctereutes, Cuon & Canis skulls.png|thumb|Skulls of various canid genera; ''[[Vulpes]]'' ([[corsac fox]]), ''[[Nyctereutes]]'' ([[raccoon dog]]), ''[[Cuon]]'' ([[dhole]]) and ''[[Canis]]'' ([[golden jackal]])]]\nWithin the Canidae, the results of [[allozyme]] and [[chromosome]] analyses have previously suggested several [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] divisions:\n# The wolf-like canids, (genus ''Canis'', ''Cuon'' and ''Lycaon'') including the [[dog]] ''(Canis lupus familiaris)'', [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[red wolf]] (''Canis rufus''), [[eastern wolf]] (''Canis lycaon''), [[coyote]] (''Canis latrans''), [[golden jackal]] (''Canis aureus''), [[Ethiopian wolf]] (''Canis simensis''), [[black-backed jackal]] (''Canis mesomelas''), [[side-striped jackal]] (''Canis adustus''), [[dhole]] (''Cuon alpinus''), and [[African wild dog]] (''Lycaon pictus'').<ref name=wayne1993 />\n# The fox-like canids, which include the [[kit fox]] (''Vulpes velox''), [[red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes''), [[Cape fox]] (''Vulpes chama''), [[Arctic fox]] (''Vulpes lagopus''), and [[fennec fox]] (''Vulpes zerda'').<ref name=wayne1993 />\n# The South American canids, including the [[bush dog]] (''Speothos venaticus''), [[hoary fox]] (''Lycalopex uetulus''), [[crab-eating fox]] (''Cerdocyon thous'') and [[maned wolf]] (''Chrysocyon brachyurus'').<ref name=wayne1993 />\n# Various [[monotypic taxon|monotypic taxa]], including the [[bat-eared fox]] (''Otocyon megalotis''), [[gray fox]] (''Urocyon cinereoargenteus''), and [[raccoon dog]] (''Nyctereutes procyonoides'').<ref name=wayne1993 />\n\n[[DNA]] analysis shows that the first three form [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[cladistics|clades]].

group of some 34 species ranging in size from the [[maned wolf]] with its long limbs to the short-legged [[bush dog]]. Modern canids inhabit forests, tundra, savannahs and deserts throughout tropical and temperate parts of the world. The evolutionary relationships between the species have been studied in the past using [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] approaches but more recently, molecular studies have enabled the investigation of [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic relationships]]. In some species, [[genetic divergence]] has been suppressed by the high level of [[gene flow]] between different populations and where the species have hybridized, large [[hybrid zone]]s exist.<ref name=Wayne>{{cite web |url=http://wooferhouse.net/Links/MolecularEvolutionOfTheDogFamily/MolecularEvolutionOfTheDogFamily.htm |title=Molecular evolution of the dog family |author=Wayne, Robert K. |accessdate=2014-05-27}}</ref>\n\n=== Eocene epoch ===\n[[Carnivoran]]s evolved from [[miacoid]]s about 55 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|Mya]]) during the late [[Paleocene]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&taxon_no=57534&is_real_user=1 |title=The Paleobiology Database |publisher=Paleodb.org |accessdate=2012-06-12}}</ref> Some five million years later, the carnivorans split into two main divisions: [[caniforms]] (dog-like) and [[feliforms]] (cat-like). By 40 Mya, the first member of the dog family proper had arisen. Called ''[[Prohesperocyon wilsoni]]'', its fossilized remains have been found in what is now the southwestern part of Texas. The chief features which identify it as a canid include the loss of the upper third molar (part of a trend toward a more shearing bite), and the structure of the middle ear which has an enlarged [[Auditory bulla|bulla]] (the hollow bony structure protecting the delicate parts of the ear).

Caninae is the only surviving subfamily and all present-day canids including wolves, foxes, coyotes, jackals, and domestic dogs belong to it.

The earliest and most primitive branch of the Canidae was the Hesperocyoninae lineage, which included the coyote-sized ''[[Mesocyon]]'' of the Oligocene (38\u201324 Mya). These early canids probably evolved for the fast pursuit of prey in a grassland habitat; they resembled modern [[civet]]s in appearance. Hesperocyonines eventually became extinct in the middle Miocene. One of the early members of the Hesperocyonines, the genus ''[[Hesperocyon]]'', gave rise to ''[[Archaeocyon]]'' and ''[[Leptocyon]]''. These branches led to the borophagine and canine [[evolutionary radiation|radiations]].<ref name=Gittleman>Martin, L.D. 1989. Fossil history of the terrestrial carnivora.

North American Quaternary Canis. Monograph of the Museum of Natural History, University of Kansas 6:1 \u2013 154.</ref>\n\nThe formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]], about 3 Mya, joined [[South America]] to North America, allowing canids to [[Great American Interchange|invade South America]], where they diversified. However, the most recent common ancestor of the South American canids lived in North America some 4 Mya and the likelihood is that there were more than one incursion across the new land bridge. One of the resulting lineages consisted of the [[gray fox]] (''Urocyon cinereoargentus'') and the now extinct [[dire wolf]] (''Canis dirus''). The other lineage consisted of the so-called South American endemic species; the [[maned wolf]] (''Chrysocyon brachyurus''), the [[short-eared dog]] (''Atelocynus microtis''), the [[bush dog]] (''Speothos venaticus''), the [[crab-eating fox]] (''Cerdocyon thous'') and the [[South American fox]]es (''Lycalopex'' spp.).

When comparing the African and Eurasian golden jackals, the study concluded that the African specimens represented a distinct monophyletic lineage that should be recognized as a separate species, ''[[Canis anthus]]'' (African golden wolf). According to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences, the Eurasian golden jackal (''Canis aureus'') diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9 million years ago but the African golden wolf separated 1.3 million years ago.

With the exceptions of the bush dog, raccoon dog, and some [[dog breed|domestic breeds of ''Canis lupus'']], canids have relatively long legs and lithe bodies, adapted for chasing prey. The tails are bushy and the length and quality of the pelage varies with the season. The muzzle portion of the skull is much more elongated than that of the cat family. The [[zygomatic arch]]es are wide, there is a transverse [[lambdoidal]] ridge at the rear of the [[cranium]] and in some species, a [[sagittal crest]] running from front to back.

With the exception of the four-toed [[Lycaon pictus|African hunting dog]] (''Lycaon pictus''), there are five toes on the forefeet but the pollex (thumb) is reduced and does not reach the ground.

They use their molars for grinding except for the lower first molar m1 (the lower carnassial) that has evolved for both cutting and grinding depending on the candid's dietary adaptation. On the lower carnassial the [[trigonid]] is used for slicing and the [[talonid]] is used for grinding.

There is a rise in [[progesterone]] during the oestral phase and the female is now receptive. Following this, the level of oestradiol fluctuates and there is a lengthy dioestrous phase during which the female is pregnant. Pseudo-pregnancy frequently occurs in canids that have ovulated but failed to conceive. A period of [[Estrous cycle#anestrus|anoestrus]] follows pregnancy or [[false pregnancy|pseudo-pregnancy]], there being only one oestral period during each breeding season. Small and medium-sized canids mostly have a [[gestation]] period of fifty to sixty days while larger species average sixty to sixty-five days. The time of year in which the breeding season occurs is related to the length of day, as has been demonstrated in the case of several species that have been translocated across the equator to the other hemisphere and experiences a six-month shift of phase. Domestic dogs and certain small canids in captivity may come into oestrus more frequently, perhaps because the [[photoperiod]] stimulus breaks down under conditions of artificial lighting.<ref name=Asa />\n\nThe size of a litter varies, with from one to sixteen or more pups being born. The young are born small, blind and helpless and require a long period of parental care.

Historically built political geography and geoculture are two significant parameters widely used in the scholarly literature about the definitions of the Central Asia.<ref>Mehmet Akif Okur, \"Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the \"Heart Of Eurasia\", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.74\u201375 http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_</ref>\n\nThe most limited definition was the official one of the [[Soviet Union]], which defined Middle Asia as consisting solely of [[Uzbekistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Kyrgyzstan]], hence omitting[[Kazakhstan]]). This definition was also often used outside the USSR during this period.\n\nHowever, the [[Russian culture]] has two distinct terms: ''\u0421\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043d\u044f\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f'' (''Srednyaya Aziya'' or \"[[Middle Asia]]\", the narrower definition, which includes only those traditionally non-Slavic, Central Asian lands that were incorporated within those borders of historical Russia) and ''\u0426\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0410\u0437\u0438\u044f'' (''Tsentralnaya Aziya'' or \"Central Asia\", the wider definition, which includes Central Asian lands that have never been part of historical Russia).\n\nSoon after independence, the leaders of the four former [[Soviet Central Asia]]n Republics met in [[Tashkent]] and declared that the definition of Central Asia should include Kazakhstan as well as the original four included by the Soviets. Since then, this has become the most common definition of Central Asia.\n\nThe [[UNESCO]] ''History of the Civilizations of Central Asia'', published in 1992, defines the region as \"Afghanistan, northeastern Iran, Pakistan, northern India, western China, Mongolia and the former Soviet Central Asian republics.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28186754|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia.|last=|first=|date=1992-2005|publisher=Unesco|others=Dani, Ahmad Hasan., Masson, V.

(3968109583).jpg|thumb|right|On the southern shore of Issyk Kul lake, [[Issyk Kul Region]].]]\nCentral Asia is an extremely large region of varied geography, including high passes and [[mountain ranges|mountains]] ([[Tian Shan]]), vast [[desert]]s ([[Kyzyl Kum]], [[Taklamakan]]), and especially treeless, grassy [[steppe]]s. The vast steppe areas of Central Asia are considered together with the steppes of [[Eastern Europe]] as a homogeneous geographical zone known as the [[Eurasian Steppe]].\n\nMuch of the land of Central Asia is too dry or too rugged for farming. The [[Gobi desert]] extends from the foot of the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamirs]], 77\u00b0&nbsp;E, to the [[Great Khingan]] (Da Hinggan) Mountains, 116\u00b0\u2013118\u00b0&nbsp;E.\n\nCentral Asia has the following geographic extremes:\n* The world's northernmost [[desert]] ([[dune|sand dunes]]), at Buurug Deliin Els, [[Mongolia]], 50\u00b018\u2032&nbsp;N.\n* The [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s southernmost [[permafrost]], at Erdenetsogt sum, [[Mongolia]], 46\u00b017\u2032&nbsp;N.\n* The world's shortest distance between non-frozen [[desert]] and [[permafrost]]: {{convert|770|km|mi|abbr=on}}.\n* The Eurasian [[pole of inaccessibility]].\n\nA majority of the people earn a living by herding livestock. Industrial activity centers in the region's cities.\n\nMajor rivers of the region include the [[Amu Darya]], the [[Syr Darya]], [[Irtysh]], the [[Hari River, Afghanistan|Hari River]] and the [[Morghab River (Afghanistan)|Murghab River]]. Major bodies of water include the [[Aral Sea]] and [[Lake Balkhash]], both of which are part of the huge west-central Asian [[endorheic]] basin that also includes the [[Caspian Sea]].\n\nBoth of these bodies of water have shrunk significantly in recent decades due to diversion of water from rivers that feed them for irrigation and industrial purposes. Water is an extremely valuable resource in arid Central Asia and can lead to rather significant international disputes.\n\n== Historical regions ==\n[[File:Central Asia Ethnic en.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|Ethnic map of Central Asia.<br /> White areas are thinly-populated semi-desert. <br />The three northwest-tending lines are the Oxus and Jaxartes Rivers flowing from the eastern mountains into the Aral Sea and in the south the irrigated north side of the  Kopet Dagh mountains.]]\n{{Location map+ | Kazakhstan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Kazakhstan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historical regions of Central Asia<br />\non a map of Kazakhstan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=73.37|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=44.00|long=76.95|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=45.00|long=85.00|label=Dzun-<br />garia|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Kazakhstan|lat=40.30|long=84.00|label=Tarim_Basin|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n|float=right\n| caption = Historical Regions of Central Asia<br />on a map of Uzbekistan\n| places  =\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=42.00|long=60.00|label=Khwarezm|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=40.00|long=72.00|label=Ferghana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.50|long=65.00|label=Transoxiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=39.00|long=65.00|label=(Sogdia)|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=43.00|long=72.00|label=Zhetysu|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.50|long=70.00|label=Bactria|position=bottom|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n{{Location map~|Uzbekistan|lat=37.00|long=61.90|label=Margiana|position=top|mark=Clear pog.svg}}\n}}\n\n{{Location map+ | Uzbekistan\n| AlternativeMap = Relief Map of Uzbekistan.png\n| width   = 300\n| caption = Historic cities of Central Asia<br />Kokand is one of the many towns that rose and fell in the Ferghana Valley\n| places  =\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.70|long=66.98|label=Samarkand|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=39.77|long=64.33|label=Bukhara|position=left|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.38|long=60.22|label=Khiva|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=40.53|long=70.93|label=Kokand|position=right}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=41.27|long=69.22|label=Tashkent|position=top|mark=Dot-yellow.svg}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=37.66|long=62.19|label=Merv}}\n{{Location map~ | Uzbekistan|lat=36.8|long=66.87|label=Balkh}}\n}}\n\nCentral Asia is bounded on the north by the forests of Siberia. The northern half of Central Asia (Kazakhstan) is the middle part of the [[Eurasian steppe]]. Westward the Kazakh steppe merges into the Russian-Ukrainian steppe and eastward into the steppes and deserts of Dzungaria and Mongolia. Southward the land becomes increasingly dry and the nomadic population increasingly thin. The south supports areas of dense population and cities wherever irrigation is possible. The main irrigated areas are along the eastern mountains, along the [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] and [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] Rivers and along the north flank of the [[Kopet Dagh]] near the Persian border. East of the Kopet Dagh is the important oasis of [[Merv]] and then a few places in Afghanistan like [[Herat]] and [[Balkh]]. Two projections of the [[Tian Shan]] create three \"bays\" along the eastern mountains. The largest, in the north, is eastern Kazakhstan, traditionally called [[Jetysu]] or Semirechye which contains [[Lake Balkhash]]. In the center is the small but densely-populated [[Ferghana valley]]. In the south is [[Bactria]], later called Tocharistan, which is bounded on the south by the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains of Afghanistan. The [[Syr Darya]] (Jaxartes) rises in the Ferghana valley and the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus) rises in Bactria. Both flow northwest into the [[Aral Sea]]. Where the Oxus meets the Aral Sea it forms a large delta called [[Khwarazm]] and later the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. North of the Oxus is the less-famous but equally important [[Zarafshan River]] which waters the great trading cities of [[Bokhara]] and [[Samarkand]]. The other great commercial city was [[Tashkent]] northwest of the mouth of the Ferghana valley. The land immediately north of the Oxus was called [[Transoxiana]] and also [[Sogdia]], especially when referring to the Sogdian merchants who dominated the silk road trade.\n\nTo the east, Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin were united into the Chinese province of [[Xinjiang]] about 1759. Caravans from China usually went along the north or south side of the Tarim basin and joined at [[Kashgar]] before crossing the mountains northwest to Ferghana or southwest to Bactria. A minor branch of the silk road went north of the Tian Shan through Dzungaria and Zhetysu before turning southwest near Tashkent. Nomadic migrations usually moved from Mongolia through Dzungaria before turning southwest to conquer the settled lands or continuing west toward Europe.\n\nThe [[Kyzyl Kum]] Desert or semi-desert is between the Oxus and Jaxartes, and the [[Karakum Desert]] is between the Oxus and [[Kopet Dagh]] in Turkmenistan. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] meant approximately northeast Persia and northern Afghanistan. [[Margiana]] was the region around Merv. The [[Ustyurt Plateau]] is between the Aral and Caspian Seas.\n\nTo the southwest, across the Kopet Dagh, lies Persia. From here Persian and Islamic civilization penetrated Central Asia and dominated its high culture until the Russian conquest. In the southeast is the route to India. In early times Buddhism spread north and throughout much of history warrior kings and tribes would move southeast to establish their rule in northern India. Most nomadic conquerors entered from the northeast. After 1800 western civilization in its Russian and Soviet form penetrated from the northwest.\n\n== Climate ==\n[[File:Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|left|Central Asia map of K\u00f6ppen climate classification.]]\nBecause Central Asia is not buffered by a large body of water, temperature fluctuations are severe, outside the sunny, hot summer months. In most areas the climate is dry and continental, with hot summers and cool to cold winters, with occasional snowfall. Outside high-elevation areas, the climate is mostly semi-arid to arid. In lower elevations, summers are hot with blazing sunshine. Winters feature occasional rain and/or snow from low-pressure systems that cross the area from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Average monthly precipitation is extremely low from July to September, rises in autumn (October and November) and is highest in March or April, followed by swift drying in May and June. Winds can be strong, producing dust storms sometimes, especially toward the end of the dry season in September and October. Specific cities that exemplify Central Asian climate patterns include [[Tashkent]] and [[Samarkand]], Uzbekistan,  [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan, and [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, the last of these representing one of the wettest climates in Central Asia, with an average annual precipitation of over 22 inches.\n\nAccording to the [[Biome#WWF system|WWF Ecozones system]], Central Asia is part of the [[Palearctic]] [[ecozone]]. The largest [[biomes]] in Central Asia are the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] biome. Central Asia also contains the [[montane grasslands and shrublands]], [[deserts and xeric shrublands]] as well as [[temperate coniferous forests]] biomes.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Scythia-Parthia 100 BC.png|thumb|right|Geographical extent of Iranian influence in the 1st century BC.

The aridness of the region made [[Agriculture in Central Asia|agriculture]] difficult, and its distance from the sea cut it off from much trade. Thus, few major cities developed in the region; instead, the area was for millennia dominated by the nomadic horse peoples of the [[steppe]].\n\nRelations between the [[Eurasian nomads|steppe nomads]] and the settled people in and around Central Asia were long marked by conflict. The nomadic lifestyle was well suited to [[war]]fare, and the steppe [[Horses in warfare|horse riders]] became some of the most militarily potent people in the world, limited only by their lack of internal unity. Any internal unity that was achieved was most probably due to the influence of the [[Silk Road]], which traveled along Central Asia. Periodically, great leaders or changing conditions would organize several tribes into one force and create an almost unstoppable power. These included the [[Huns|Hun]] invasion of Europe, the [[Five Barbarians|Wu Hu]] attacks on China and most notably the [[Timeline of Mongol conquests|Mongol conquest]] of much of [[Eurasia]].<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta's_Trip_Three.html A Land Conquered by the Mongols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423014420/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Battuta%27s_Trip_Three.html |date=23 April 2008 }}</ref>\n[[File:Men from Khiva.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Uzbek men from [[Khiva]], ca. 1861\u20131880]]\nDuring pre-Islamic and early Islamic times, southern Central Asia was inhabited predominantly by speakers of [[Iranian languages]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>C.E.

The [[Tang Dynasty|Tang Chinese]] were defeated by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Arabs]] at the [[battle of Talas]] in 751, marking the end of the Tang Dynasty's western expansion. The [[Tibetan Empire]] would take the chance to rule portion of Central Asia along with South Asia. During the 13th and 14th centuries, the [[Mongols]] conquered and ruled the largest contiguous empire in recorded history.  Most of Central Asia fell under the control of the [[Chagatai Khanate]]. [[File:SB - Kazakh man on horse with golden eagle.jpg|thumb|[[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] man on a horse with golden eagle]]\nThe dominance of the nomads ended in the 16th century, as [[firearm]]s allowed settled peoples to gain control of the region. [[Russia]], [[China]], and other powers expanded into the region and had captured the bulk of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the western Central Asian regions were incorporated into the [[Soviet Union]]. The eastern part of Central Asia, known as East Turkistan or [[Xinjiang]], was [[Incorporation of Xinjiang into the People's Republic of China|incorporated]] into the [[People's Republic of China]]. Mongolia remained independent but became a Soviet [[satellite state]]. Afghanistan remained relatively independent of major influence by the USSR until the [[Saur Revolution]] of 1978.\n\nThe Soviet areas of Central Asia saw much [[Soviet infrastructure in Central Asia|industrialization and construction of infrastructure]], but also the suppression of local cultures, hundreds of thousands of deaths from failed collectivization programs, and a lasting legacy of ethnic tensions and environmental problems.

Thus, [[Yama (East Asia)|Yama]], Lord of Death, was revered in Tibet as a spiritual guardian and judge. Mongolian Buddhism, in particular, was influenced by Tibetan Buddhism. The [[Qianlong Emperor]] of Qing China in the 18th century was Tibetan Buddhist and would sometimes travel from [[Beijing]] to other cities for personal religious worship.\n\nCentral Asia also has an indigenous form of improvisational [[oral poetry]] that is over 1000 years old. It is principally practiced in Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan by ''akyns'', lyrical improvisationists. They engage in [[Freestyle battle|lyrical battles]], the ''aitysh'' or the ''alym sabak''. The tradition arose out of early bardic [[Oral history|oral historians]]. They are usually accompanied by a [[String instrument|stringed instrument]]\u2014in Kyrgyzstan, a three-stringed [[komuz]], and in Kazakhstan, a similar two-stringed instrument, the dombra.\n\nPhotography in Central Asia began to develop after 1882, when a [[Russian Mennonite]] photographer named Wilhelm Penner moved to the [[Khanate of Khiva]] during the Mennonite migration to Central Asia led by [[Claas Epp, Jr.]]. Upon his arrival to [[Khanate of Khiva]], Penner shared his photography skills with a local student Khudaybergen Divanov, who later became the founder of [[Uzbek photography]].<ref>Walter Ratliff, \"Pilgrims on the Silk Road: A Muslim-Christian Encounter in Khiva\", Wipf and Stock Publishers, 2010</ref>\n\nSome also learn to sing the ''[[Manas (epic)|Manas]]'', Kyrgyzstan's epic poem (those who learn the ''Manas'' exclusively but do not improvise are called ''manaschis''). During Soviet rule, ''akyn'' performance was co-opted by the authorities and subsequently declined in popularity. With the fall of the Soviet Union, it has enjoyed a resurgence, although ''akyns'' still do use their art to campaign for political candidates. A 2005 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' article proposed a similarity between the improvisational art of ''akyns'' and modern [[freestyle rap]] performed in the West.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A10646-2005Mar5.html|title=\"In Central Asia, a Revival of an Ancient Form of Rap \u2013 Art of Ad-Libbing Oral History Draws New Devotees in Post-Communist Era\" by Peter Finn, Washington Post Foreign Service, Sunday, March 6, 2005, p.

The first years of the Soviet regime saw the appearance of modernism, which took inspiration from the Russian avant-garde movement. Until the 1980s, Central Asian arts had developed along with general tendencies of Soviet arts. In the 90's, arts of the region underwent some significant changes. Institutionally speaking, some fields of arts were regulated by the birth of the art market, some stayed as representatives of official views, while many were sponsored by international organizations. The years of 1990\u20132000 were times for the establishment of contemporary arts. In the region, many important international exhibitions are taking place, Central Asian art is represented in European and American museums, and the Central Asian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale has been organized since 2005.\n\n=== Sports ===\n[[Equestrianism|Equestrian sports]] are traditional in Central Asia, with disciplines like [[endurance riding]], [[buzkashi]], [[dzhigit]] and [[kyz kuu]].\n\n[[Association football]] is popular across Central Asia.

However, [[Kazakhstan]] is a member of the [[UEFA]].\n\n[[Wrestling]] is popular across Central Asia, with Kazakhstan having claimed 14 Olympic medals and Uzbekistan seven. As former Soviet states, Central Asian countries have been successful in [[gymnastics]].\n\n[[Cricket]] is the most popular sport in [[Afghanistan]]. The [[Afghanistan national cricket team]], first formed in 2001, has claimed wins over Bangladesh, West Indies and Zimbabwe.\n\nNotable Kazakh competitors include cyclists [[Alexander Vinokourov]] and [[Andrey Kashechkin]], boxer [[Vassiliy Jirov]] and [[Gennady Golovkin]], runner [[Olga Shishigina]], decathlete [[Dmitriy Karpov]], gymnast [[Aliya Yussupova]], judoka [[Askhat Zhitkeyev]] and [[Maxim Rakov]], skier [[Vladimir Smirnov (skier)|Vladimir Smirnov]], weightlifter [[Ilya Ilyin]], and figure skaters [[Denis Ten]] and [[Elizabet Tursynbaeva]].\n\nNotable Uzbekistani competitors include cyclist [[Djamolidine Abdoujaparov]], boxer [[Ruslan Chagaev]], canoer [[Michael Kolganov]], gymnast [[Oksana Chusovitina]], tennis player [[Denis Istomin]], chess player [[Rustam Kasimdzhanov]], and figure skater [[Misha Ge]].\n\n== Economy ==\n[[File:GDP growth trends in Central Asia, 2000\u22122013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|GDP growth trends in Central Asia, 2000\u20132013.

The ultimate aim is to emulate the Asian Tigers by becoming the local equivalent, Central Asian snow leopards. However, reform has been deliberately gradual and selective, as governments strive to limit the social cost and ameliorate living standards. All five countries are implementing structural reforms to improve competitiveness. In particular, they have been modernizing the industrial sector and fostering the development of service industries through business-friendly fiscal policies and other measures, to reduce the share of agriculture in GDP. Between 2005 and 2013, the share of agriculture dropped in all but Tajikistan, where it progressed to the detriment of industry. The fastest growth in industry was observed in Turkmenistan, whereas the services sector progressed most in the other four countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nPublic policies pursued by Central Asian governments focus on buffering the political and economic spheres from external shocks. This includes maintaining a trade balance, minimizing public debt and accumulating national reserves. They cannot totally insulate themselves from negative exterior forces, however, such as the persistently weak recovery of global industrial production and international trade since 2008. Notwithstanding this, they have emerged relatively unscathed from the global financial crisis of 2008\u20132009. Growth faltered only briefly in Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan and not at all in Uzbekistan, where the economy grew by more than 7% per year on average between 2008 and 2013. Turkmenistan flirted with growth of 15% (14.7%) in 2011. Kyrgyzstan's performance has been more erratic but this phenomenon was visible well before 2008.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe republics which have fared best surfed on the wave of the commodities boom during the first decade of the new century. Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan have abundant oil and natural gas reserves and Uzbekistan's own reserves make it more or less self-sufficient. Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan all have gold reserves and Kazakhstan has the world's largest uranium reserves. Fluctuating global demand for cotton, aluminium and other metals (except gold) in recent years has hit Tajikistan hardest, since aluminium and raw cotton are its chief exports \u2212 the Tajik Aluminium Company is the country's primary industrial asset. In January 2014, the Minister of Agriculture announced the government's intention to reduce the acreage of land cultivated by cotton to make way for other crops. Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are major cotton exporters themselves, ranking fifth and ninth respectively worldwide for volume in 2014.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite book|title=Central Asia.

Kyrgyzstan has the added disadvantage of being considered resource poor, although it does have ample water. Most of its electricity is generated by hydropower.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe Kyrgyz economy was shaken by a series of shocks between 2010 and 2012. In April 2010, President Kurmanbek Bakiyev was deposed by a popular uprising, with former minister of foreign affairs Roza Otunbayeva assuring the interim presidency until the election of Almazbek Atambayev in November 2011. Food prices rose two years in a row and, in 2012, production at the major Kumtor gold mine fell by 60% after the site was perturbed by geological movements. According to the World Bank, 33.7% of the population was living in absolute poverty in 2010 and 36.8% a year later.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nDespite high rates of economic growth in recent years, GDP per capita in Central Asia was higher than the average for developing countries only in Kazakhstan in 2013 (PPP$23 206) and Turkmenistan (PPP$14 201). It dropped to PPP$5 167 for Uzbekistan, home to 45% of the region's population, and was even lower for Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan leads the Central Asian region in terms of foreign direct investments. The Kazakh economy sccounts for more than 70% of all the investment attracted in Central Asia.<ref>{{cite web |title=70% of investments into Central Asia are drawn to Kazakhstan |url=http://kazakh-tv.kz/en/view/business/page_198413_70-of-investments-into-central-asia-are-drawn-to-kazakhstan |website=kazakh-tv.kz}}</ref>\n\n== Science and technology ==\n{{See also|Science and technology in Kazakhstan|Science and technology in Kyrgyzstan|Science and technology in Tajikistan|Science and technology in Turkmenistan|Science and technology in Uzbekistan}}\n\n=== Modernization of research infrastructure ===\nBolstered by strong economic growth in all but [[Science and technology in Kyrgyzstan|Kyrgyzstan]], national development strategies are fostering new high-tech industries, pooling resources and orienting the economy towards export markets. Many national research institutions established during the Soviet era have since become obsolete with the development of new technologies and changing national priorities. This has led countries to reduce the number of national research institutions since 2009 by grouping existing institutions to create research hubs. Several of the [[Turkmen Academy of Sciences|Turkmen Academy of Science\u2019]]<nowiki/>s institutes were merged in 2014: the Institute of Botany was merged with the Institute of Medicinal Plants to become the [[Institute of Biology and Medicinal Plants]]; the Sun Institute was merged with the Institute of Physics and Mathematics to become the [[Institute of Solar Energy]]; and the Institute of Seismology merged with the State Service for Seismology to become the [[Institute of Seismology and Atmospheric Physics]]. In [[Science and technology in Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], more than 10 institutions of the Academy of Sciences have been reorganized, following the issuance of a decree by the Cabinet of Ministers in February 2012. The aim is to orient academic research towards problem-solving and ensure continuity between basic and applied research. For example, the Mathematics and Information Technology Research Institute has been subsumed under the [[National University of Uzbekistan]] and the Institute for Comprehensive Research on Regional Problems of Samarkand has been transformed into a problem-solving laboratory on environmental issues within [[Samarkand State University]]. Other research institutions have remained attached to the [[Academy of Sciences of Uzbekistan|Uzbek Academy of Sciences]], such as the [[Centre of Genomics and Bioinformatics]].<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[Science and technology in Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]] and [[Science and technology in Turkmenistan|Turkmenistan]] are also building technology parks as part of their drive to modernize infrastructure. In 2011, construction began of a technopark in the village of Bikrova near Ashgabat, the Turkmen capital. It will combine research, education, industrial facilities, business incubators and exhibition centres. The technopark will house research on alternative energy sources (sun, wind) and the assimilation of nanotechnologies. Between 2010 and 2012, technological parks were set up in the east, south and north Kazakhstan oblasts (administrative units) and in the capital, Astana. A Centre for Metallurgy was also established in the east Kazakhstan oblast, as well as a Centre for Oil and Gas Technologies which will be part of the planned Caspian Energy Hub. In addition, the Centre for Technology Commercialization has been set up in Kazakhstan as part of the Parasat National Scientific and Technological Holding, a joint stock company established in 2008 that is 100% state-owned. The centre supports research projects in technology marketing, intellectual property protection, technology licensing contracts and start-ups. The centre plans to conduct a technology audit in Kazakhstan and to review the legal framework regulating the commercialization of research results and technology.<ref name=\":13\" />[[File:Trends in GERD GDP ratio in Central Asia, 2001\u22122013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Trends in research expenditure in Central Asia, as a percentage of GDP, 2001\u20132013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: 2030 (2015), Figure 14.3]]Countries are seeking to augment the efficiency of traditional extractive sectors but also to make greater use of information and communication technologies and other modern technologies, such as solar energy, to develop the business sector, education and research. In March 2013, two research institutes were created by presidential decree to foster the development of alternative energy sources in Uzbekistan, with funding from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and other institutions: the SPU Physical\u2212Technical Institute ([[Physics Sun Institute]]) and the [[International Solar Energy Institute]]. Three universities have been set up since 2011 to foster competence in strategic economic areas: [[Nazarbayev University]] in Kazakhstan (first intake in 2011), an international research university, [[Inha University in Tashkent|Inha University]] in Uzbekistan (first intake in 2014), specializing in information and communication technologies, and the [[International Oil and Gas University]] in Turkmenistan (founded in 2013). Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are both generalizing the teaching of foreign languages at school, in order to facilitate international ties. Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have both adopted the three-tier bachelor's, master's and PhD degree system, in 2007 and 2012 respectively, which is gradually replacing the Soviet system of Candidates and Doctors of Science. In 2010, Kazakhstan became the only Central Asian member of the [[Bologna Process]], which seeks to harmonize higher education systems in order to create a European Higher Education Area.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n=== Financial investment in research ===\nThe Central Asian republics' ambition of developing the business sector, education and research is being hampered by chronic low investment in research and development. Over the decade to 2013, the region's investment in research and development hovered around 0.2\u20130.3% of GDP. Uzbekistan broke with this trend in 2013 by raising its own research intensity to 0.41% of GDP.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development \u2013 but research intensity overall is low in Kazakhstan: just 0.18% of GDP in 2013. Moreover, few industrial enterprises conduct research in Kazakhstan. Only one in eight (12.5%) of the country's manufacturing firms were active in innovation in 2012, according to a survey by the [[UNESCO Institute for Statistics]]. Enterprises prefer to purchase technological solutions that are already embodied in imported machinery and equipment. Just 4% of firms purchase the license and patents that come with this technology. Nevertheless, there appears to be a growing demand for the products of research, since enterprises spent 4.5 times more on scientific and technological services in 2008 than in 1997.<ref name=\":13\" />\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by sector of employment (HC), 2013.

The number of researchers per million population is close to the world average (1,083 in 2013) in Kazakhstan (1,046) and higher than the world average in Uzbekistan (1,097).<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is the only Central Asian country where the business enterprise and private non-profit sectors make any significant contribution to research and development. Uzbekistan is in a particularly vulnerable position, with its heavy reliance on higher education: three-quarters of researchers were employed by the university sector in 2013 and just 6% in the business enterprise sector. With most Uzbek university researchers nearing retirement, this imbalance imperils Uzbekistan's research future. Almost all holders of a Candidate of Science, Doctor of Science or PhD are more than 40 years old and half are aged over 60; more than one in three researchers (38.4%) holds a PhD degree, or its equivalent, the remainder holding a bachelor's or master's degree.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n[[File:Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|Central Asian researchers by field of science, 2013. Source: UNESCO Science Report: towards 2030 (2015), Figure 14.4]]Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan have all maintained a share of women researchers above 40% since the fall of the Soviet Union. Kazakhstan has even achieved gender parity, with Kazakh women dominating medical and health research and representing some 45\u201355% of engineering and technology researchers in 2013. In Tajikistan, however, only one in three scientists (34%) was a woman in 2013, down from 40% in 2002. Although policies are in place to give Tajik women equal rights and opportunities, these are underfunded and poorly understood. Turkmenistan has offered a state guarantee of equality for women since a law adopted in 2007 but the lack of available data makes it impossible to draw any conclusions as to the law's impact on research.  As for Turkmenistan, it does not make data available on higher education, research expenditure or researchers.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\n'''Table:''' '''PhDs obtained in science and engineering in Central Asia, 2013 or closest year'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" href=\"\u00dcr\u00fcmqi\"\n| href=\"File:Bringing the sheep home, on the southern shore of Issy-Kol.

In November 2011, the 10 member countries adopted the ''CAREC 2020 Strategy'', a blueprint for furthering regional co-operation. Over the decade to 2020, US$50 billion is being invested in priority projects in transport, trade and energy to improve members' competitiveness. The landlocked Central Asian republics are conscious of the need to co-operate in order to maintain and develop their transport networks and energy, communication and irrigation systems. Only Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan border the [[Caspian Sea]] and none of the republics has direct access to an ocean, complicating the transportation of hydrocarbons, in particular, to world markets.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan is also one of the three founding members of the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] in 2014, along with Belarus and the Russian Federation. Armenia and Kyrgyzstan have since joined this body. As co-operation among the member states in science and technology is already considerable and well-codified in legal texts, the Eurasian Economic Union is expected to have a limited additional impact on co-operation among public laboratories or academia but it should encourage business ties and scientific mobility, since it includes provision for the free circulation of labour and unified patent regulations.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002354/235406e.pdf|title=Countries in the Black Sea basin.

At the time, Vladimir Debabov, Scientific Director of the Genetika State Research Institute for Genetics and the Selection of Industrial Micro-organisms in the Russian Federation, stressed the paramount importance of developing bio-industry. \u2018In the world today, there is a strong tendency to switch from petrochemicals to renewable biological sources,\u2019 he said. \u2018Biotechnology is developing two to three times faster than chemicals.\u2019<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nKazakhstan also participated in a second project of the Eurasian Economic Community, the establishment of the  Centre for Innovative Technologies on 4 April 2013, with the signing of an agreement between the Russian Venture Company (a government fund of funds), the Kazakh JSC National Agency and the Belarusian Innovative Foundation. Each of the selected projects is entitled to funding of US$3\u201390 million and is implemented within a public\u2013private partnership. The first few approved projects focused on supercomputers, space technologies, medicine, petroleum recycling, nanotechnologies and the ecological use of natural resources. Once these initial projects have spawned viable commercial products, the venture company plans to reinvest the profits in new projects. This venture company is not a purely economic structure; it has also been designed to promote a common economic space among the three participating countries.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nFour of the five Central Asian republics have also been involved in a project launched by the [[European Union]] in September 2013, IncoNet CA. The aim of this project is to encourage [[European Union's scientific cooperation beyond the bloc|Central Asian countries to participate in research projects]] within [[Horizon 2020]], the European Union's eighth research and innovation funding programme. The focus of this research projects is on three societal challenges considered as being of mutual interest to both the European Union and Central Asia, namely: climate change, energy and health. IncoNet CA builds on the experience of earlier projects which involved other regions, such as Eastern Europe, the South Caucasus and the Western Balkans. IncoNet CA focuses on twinning research facilities in Central Asia and Europe. It involves a consortium of partner institutions from Austria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Portugal, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan. In May 2014, the European Union launched a 24-month call for project applications from twinned institutions \u2013 universities, companies and research institutes \u2013 for funding of up to \u20ac10, 000 to enable them to visit one another's facilities to discuss project ideas or prepare joint events like workshops.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nThe [[International Science and Technology Center]] (ISTC) was established in 1992 by the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation and the US to engage weapons scientists in civilian research projects and to foster technology transfer.

The region itself never held a dominant stationary population nor was able to make use of natural resources. Thus, it has rarely throughout history become the seat of power for an empire or influential state. Central Asia has been divided, redivided, conquered out of existence, and fragmented time and time again. Central Asia has served more as the battleground for outside powers than as a power in its own right.\n\nCentral Asia had both the advantage and disadvantage of a central location between four historical seats of power. From its central location, it has access to trade routes to and from all the regional powers. On the other hand, it has been continuously vulnerable to attack from all sides throughout its history, resulting in political fragmentation or outright power vacuum, as it is successively dominated.\n\n* To the North, the steppe allowed for rapid mobility, first for nomadic horseback warriors like the Huns and Mongols, and later for Russian traders, eventually supported by railroads. As the Russian Empire expanded to the East, it would also push down into Central Asia towards the sea, in a search for warm water ports. The Soviet bloc would reinforce dominance from the North and attempt to project power as far south as Afghanistan.\n* To the East, the demographic and cultural weight of Chinese empires continually pushed outward into Central Asia since the [[Silk Road]] period of [[Han Dynasty]]. However, with the Sino-Soviet split and collapse of Soviet Union, China would project its soft power into Central Asia, most notably in the case of Afghanistan, to counter Russian dominance of the region.\n* To the Southeast, the demographic and cultural influence of India was felt in Central Asia, notably in Tibet, the [[Hindu Kush]], and slightly beyond. From its base in India, the [[British Empire]] competed with the Russian Empire for influence in the region in the 19th and 20th centuries.\n* To the Southwest, Western Asian powers have expanded into the southern areas of Central Asia (usually Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan). Several Persian empires would conquer and reconquer parts of Central Asia; Alexander the Great's Hellenic empire would extend into Central Asia; two Islamic empires would exert substantial influence throughout the region; and the modern state of Iran has projected influence throughout the region as well. Turkey, through a common [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] nation identity, has gradually increased its ties and influence as well in the region. Furthermore, since Uzbekistan announced their intention to join in April 2018, Turkey and all of the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states except Turkmenistan are together  part of the [[Turkic Council]].<ref>http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/uzbekistan-decides-to-join-turkic-alliance-during-erdogans-visit-131109</ref>\n\nIn the post\u2013Cold War era, Central Asia is an ethnic cauldron, prone to instability and conflicts, without a sense of national identity, but rather a mess of historical cultural influences, tribal and clan loyalties, and religious fervor. Projecting influence into the area is no longer just Russia, but also Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan, India and the United States:\n* Russia continues to dominate political decision-making throughout the former SSRs; although, as other countries move into the area, Russia's influence has begun to wane though Russia still maintains military bases in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Why Russia Will Send More Troops to Central Asia|url = https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/why-russia-will-send-more-troops-central-asia|website = Stratfor|accessdate = 2015-09-26}}</ref>\n* The United States, with its military involvement in the region and oil diplomacy, is also significantly involved in the region's politics.

U.S. military bases have also been established in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, causing both Russia and the People's Republic of China to voice their concern over a permanent U.S. military presence in the region.\n\nWestern governments have accused Russia, China and the former Soviet republics of justifying the suppression of separatist movements, and the associated ethnics and religion with the War on Terror.\n\n== Major cultural, scientific and economic centres ==\n=== Cities within the regular definition of Central Asia and Afghanistan ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|City\n! style=\"width:150px;\"|Country\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Population\n! style=\"width:200px;\"|Image\n! style=\"width:350px;\"|Information\n|-\n| [[Astana]]\n| {{flag|Kazakhstan}}\n| {{nts|1,006,574}}<br />(2017)\n| [[File:Central Astana on a Sunny, Snowy Day in February 2013.jpg|200px]]\n| The capital and second largest city in Kazakhstan.

The semolina is sprinkled with water and rolled with the hands to form small pellets, sprinkled with dry flour to keep them separate, and then sieved. Any pellets that are too small to be finished granules of couscous fall through the sieve and are again rolled and sprinkled with dry semolina and rolled into pellets. This labor-intensive process continues until all the semolina has been formed into tiny granules of couscous. In the traditional method of preparing couscous, groups of women came together to make large batches over several days, which were then dried in the sun and used for several months. Handmade couscous may need to be rehydrated as it is prepared; this is achieved by a process of moistening and steaming over stew until the couscous reaches the desired light and fluffy consistency. <ref name=asbell>{{Cite book| publisher = Chronicle Books| isbn = 978-1-4521-0042-5| last = Asbell| first = Robin| title = The New Whole Grain Cookbook: Terrific Recipes Using Farro, Quinoa, Brown Rice, Barley, and Many Other Delicious and Nutritious Grains| date = 2011-11-18}}</ref> \n\nIn some regions couscous is made from [[Farina (food)|Farina]] or coarsely ground [[barley]] or [[pearl millet]].

This couscous can be sauteed before it is cooked in water or another liquid.<ref name=asbell /> Properly cooked couscous is light and fluffy, not gummy or gritty. Traditionally, North Africans use a [[food steamer]] (called a''Taseksut'' in [[Berber language|Berber]], a {{lang|ar|\u0643\u0650\u0633\u0652\u0643\u064e\u0627\u0633}} ''kiskas'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or a ''[[couscoussier]]'' in [[French language|French]]). The base is a tall metal pot shaped rather like an oil jar in which the meat and vegetables are cooked as a stew. On top of the base, a steamer sits where the couscous is cooked, absorbing the flavours from the stew. The lid to the steamer has holes around its edge so steam can escape. It is also possible to use a pot with a steamer insert. If the holes are too big, the steamer can be lined with damp [[cheesecloth]]. There is little [[archaeology|archaeological]] evidence of early diets including couscous, possibly because the original ''couscoussier'' was probably made from organic materials that could not survive extended exposure to the elements.\n\n===Instant couscous===\nThe couscous that is sold in most [[Western culture|Western]] supermarkets has been pre-steamed and dried. It is typically prepared by adding 1.5 measures of boiling water or stock to each measure of couscous then leaving covered tightly for about five minutes. Pre-steamed couscous takes less time to prepare than regular couscous, most dried [[pasta]], or dried grains (such as [[rice]]).\n\n===Local serving variations===\n[[Image:MoroccanCouscous.jpg|thumb|Couscous with various toppings]]\nIn Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Libya, couscous is generally served with vegetables ([[carrot]]s, [[potato]]es, [[turnip]]s, ''etc.'') cooked in a spicy or mild [[broth]] or stew, and some meat (generally, [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]] or [[lamb and mutton|mutton]]). In the [[Sahel]]ian countries of West Africa, such as [[Mali]] and [[Senegal]], [[pearl millet]] is pounded or milled to the size and consistency necessary for the couscous.<ref>Sivak MN. ''Starch: Basic Science to Biotechnology''. Academic Press, 1998, {{ISBN|0-12-016441-8}}, p. 132</ref><ref name=\"milletCC\"/>\n\nIn Algeria and Morocco it is also served, sometimes at the end of a meal or just by itself, as a delicacy called ''\"sfouff\"''. The couscous is usually steamed several times until it is very fluffy and pale in color. It is then sprinkled with [[almond]]s, [[cinnamon]] and [[sugar]]. Traditionally, this dessert is served with milk perfumed with [[orange flower water]], or it can be served plain with [[buttermilk]] in a bowl as a cold light soup for supper.\n\nIn Tunisia, it is made mostly spicy with [[harissa]] sauce and served with almost everything, including lamb, fish, seafood, beef and sometimes in southern regions, camel. [[Fish]] couscous is a Tunisian specialty and can also be made with [[octopus as food|octopus]], [[squid as food|squid]] or other [[seafood]] in hot, red, spicy sauce. Couscous in Tunisia is served on every occasion; it is also served in some regions (mostly during [[Ramadan]]), sweetened as a dessert called masfouf.\n\nIn Libya, it is mostly served with meat, specifically mostly lamb, but also [[Camel#Food uses|camel]], and very rarely beef, in Tripoli and the western parts of Libya, but not during official ceremonies or weddings. Another way to eat couscous is as a dessert; it is prepared with dates, sesame, and pure honey, and locally referred to as \"maghrood\".\n\nCouscous is also very popular in France, where it is now considered a traditional dish, and has also become common in Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Greece. Indeed, many polls have indicated that it is often a favorite dish.<ref> Study conducted on January 11 and 12, 2006, for the magazine ''Notre Temps'' based on face-to-face interviews with a sample of {{formatnum:1000}} people representative of the adult French population, stratified by age, sex, profession of the head of household, region and type of municipality.</ref> Couscous is served in many Maghrebi restaurants all over the world. In France, Spain and Italy, the word \"couscous\" (''cusc\u00fas'' in Spanish and Italian; ''cuscuz'' in Portuguese) usually refers to couscous together with the stew. Packaged sets containing a box of quick-preparation couscous and a can of vegetables and, generally, meat are sold in French, Spanish and Italian [[grocery store]]s and [[supermarket]]s.

It is prepared with butter, sugar, cinnamon, raisins, and nuts and topped with cream. In Palestine, maftoul is considered as a special type of couscous but made from different ingredients and a different shape. It is larger than North African couscous, but is similarly steamed and often served on special occasions in a chicken broth with garbanzo beans and tender pieces of chicken taken off the bone. Maftoul is an Arabic word derived from the root \"fa-ta-la\", which means to roll or to twist, which is exactly describing the method used to make maftoul by hand rolling [[bulgur]] with wheat flour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kitchen of Palestine Palestinian Couscous (Maftoul) -|url=http://www.kitchenofpalestine.com/palestinian-couscous-maftoul|website=www.kitchenofpalestine.com|accessdate=9 August 2017}}</ref> Maftoul is a special dish in Palestinian cuisine and not every cook knows how to prepare it. In fact, there is an annual Maftoul Festival which involves a competition held in Bir Zeit every year.\n\nCouscous may be used to make a breakfast [[tabbouleh]] salad.

The second son of [[Constantine I]] and [[Fausta]], he ascended to the throne with his brothers [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]] and [[Constans]] upon their father's death.\n\nIn 340, Constantius' brothers clashed over the western provinces of the empire. The resulting conflict left Constantine II dead and Constans as ruler of the west until he was overthrown and assassinated in 350 by the [[usurper]] [[Magnentius]]. Unwilling to accept Magnentius as co-ruler, Constantius defeated him at the battles of [[Battle of Mursa Major|Mursa Major]] and [[Battle of Mons Seleucus|Mons Seleucus]].  Magnentius committed suicide after the latter battle, leaving Constantius as sole ruler of the empire.\n\nHis subsequent military campaigns against Germanic tribes were successful: he defeated the [[Alamanni]] in 354 and campaigned across the [[Danube]] against the [[Quadi]] and [[Sarmatians]] in 357. In contrast, the [[Persian wars of Constantius II|war in the east]] against the [[Sassanids]] continued with mixed results.\n\nIn 351, due to the difficulty of managing the empire alone, Constantius elevated his cousin [[Constantius Gallus]] to the subordinate rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', but had him executed three years later after receiving scathing reports of his violent and corrupt nature. Shortly thereafter, in 355, Constantius promoted his last surviving cousin, Gallus' younger half-brother [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]], to the rank of ''Caesar''.\n\nHowever, Julian claimed the rank of [[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]] in 360, leading to war between the two. Ultimately, no battle was fought as Constantius became ill and died late in 361, though not before naming Julian as his successor.\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Roman Imperial Follis Caesar Constantius II 325.jpg|left|thumb|Caesar Constantius II on an early [[follis]] of [[Heraclea Lucania|Heraclea]] 325]]\n[[File:Impero Romano da maggio a settembre 337.png|thumb|Division of the Roman Empire among the Caesars appointed by [[Constantine I]]: from west to east, the territories of [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constans I]], [[Dalmatius]] and Constantius II.

Vetranio immediately sent letters to Constantius pledging his loyalty, which Constantius may have accepted simply in order to stop Magnentius from gaining more support.

Constantius subsequently sent Vetranio the imperial diadem and acknowledged the general\u2018s new position as ''[[Augustus (title)|Augustus]]''.

Silvanus had surrendered to Constantius after the [[Battle of Mursa Major]]. Constantius had made him magister militum in 353 with the purpose of blocking the German threats, a feat that Silvanus achieved by bribing the German tribes with the money he had collected. A plot organized by members of Constantius' court led the emperor to recall Silvanus. After Silvanus revolted, he received a letter from Constantius recalling him to Milan, but which made no reference to the revolt. [[Ursicinus (Roman general)|Ursicinus]], who was meant to replace Silvanus, bribed some troops, and Silvanus was killed.\n\nConstantius realised that too many threats still faced the Empire, however, and he could not possibly handle all of them by himself. So on 6 November 355,<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.17</ref> he elevated his last remaining male relative, [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], to the rank of [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]].<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.5\u201316</ref> A few days later, Julian was married to [[Helena, wife of Julian|Helena]], the last surviving sister of Constantius.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XV.8.18</ref> Constantius soon sent Julian off to Gaul.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nConstantius spent the next few years overseeing affairs in the western part of the empire primarily from his base at Mediolanum. In 357 he visited [[Rome]] for the only time in his life. The same year, he forced [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] and [[Quadi]] invaders out of Pannonia and [[Moesia|Moesia Inferior]], then led a successful counter-attack across the Danube.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XVI.12</ref>\n\n[[File:Byzantine - Belt Section with Medallions of Constantius II and Faustina - Walters 57527 - Back.jpg|right|thumb|This section of a belt contains two gold medallions.

In 360, when news reached Constantius that Shapur II had destroyed [[Singara]],<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.6</ref> and taken [[Hasankeyf|Kiphas]] ([[Hasankeyf]]), [[Diyarbak\u0131r|Amida]],<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XIX</ref> and [[Cizre|Ad Tigris]] ([[Cizre]]),<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.7.1\u201316</ref> he decided to travel east to face the re-emergent threat.\n\n===Usurpation of Julian and crises in the east===\nIn the meantime, Julian had won some victories against the [[Alamanni]], who had once again invaded [[Roman Gaul]]. However, when Constantius requested reinforcements from Julian\u2019s army for the eastern campaign, the Gallic legions revolted and proclaimed Julian ''Augustus''.<ref>[[Julian the Apostate]], ''Letter To The Senate And People of Athens'', X.12\u201317</ref><ref>[[Libanius]], ''Orations'' XII.58 & XVIII.90-1</ref><ref>[[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]], ''Historiae Romanae Breviarium'' X.15.1</ref><ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.4.1\u20132</ref>\n\nOn account of the immediate Sassanid threat, Constantius was unable to directly respond to his cousin\u2019s usurpation, other than by sending missives in which he tried to convince Julian to resign the title of ''Augustus'' and be satisfied with that of ''Caesar''. By 361, Constantius saw no alternative but to face the usurper with force, and yet the threat of the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] remained. Constantius had already spent part of early 361 unsuccessfully attempting to re-take the fortress of Ad Tigris.<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XX.11.6\u201325</ref> After a time he had withdrawn to [[Antioch]] to regroup and prepare for a confrontation with [[Shapur II]].<ref>[[Ammianus Marcellinus]], ''Res Gestae'' XXI.7.7 & 13.1\u20135</ref> The campaigns of the previous year had inflicted heavy losses on the Sassanids, however, and they did not attempt another round of campaigns that year. This temporary respite in hostilities allowed Constantius to turn his full attention to facing Julian.<ref name=\"Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508\">Vagi, D.L. & Coquand, T., ''Coinage and History of the Roman Empire'' (2001), p. 508</ref>\n\n===Death===\nConstantius immediately gathered his forces and set off west. However, by the time he reached [[Mopsuestia]] in Cilicia, it was clear that he was fatally ill and would not survive to face Julian. Apparently, realising his death was near, Constantius had himself baptised by [[Arianism|Euzoius]], the [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] bishop of [[Antioch]], and then declared that Julian was his rightful successor.<ref name=\"Vagi, D.L. 2001 p. 508\"/> Constantius II died of fever on 3 November 361.<ref>The manuscript of Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'' 21.15.2 reads ''tertium nonarum Octobrium'', which is the equivalent of 5 October. The latest editor of the ''Res Gestae'' accepts Otto Seeck's emendation ''tertium nonarum Novembrium'' which is the equivalent of 3 November. T.D. Barnes (''Classical Philology'', 88 [1993], p. 64f) provides indirect evidence showing 3 November is a better fit.</ref>\n\n==Marriages and children==\nConstantius II was married three times:\n\nFirst to a [[Daughter of Julius Constantius|daughter]] of his half-uncle [[Julius Constantius]], whose name is unknown.

As a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Roman Emperor]], Constantius made a concerted effort to promote [[Christianity]] at the expense of [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman polytheism]] (\u2018paganism\u2019). He issued a number of edicts designed to carry out this agenda (see below). Constantius also took an active part in attempting to shape the [[Christianity|Christian]] church.\n\n===Paganism===\n{{See also|Anti-paganism policy of Constantius II}}\nIn spite of some of the edicts issued by Constantius, he never made any attempt to disband the various Roman priestly colleges or the [[Vestal Virgin]]s, he never acted against the various pagan schools, and, at times, he actually made some effort to protect paganism. In fact, he even ordered the election of a priest for Africa.<ref name=\"Vasiliev, A.A 1958 p. 68\">Vasiliev, A.A, ''History of the Byzantine Empire 324\u20131453'' (1958), p. 68</ref> Also, he remained [[pontifex maximus]] and was deified by the Roman Senate after his death. His relative moderation toward paganism is reflected by the fact that it was over twenty years after his death, during the reign of [[Gratian]], that any pagan senator protested his treatment of their religion.<ref>Salzman, M.R., ''The Making of a Christian Aristocracy: Social and Religious Change in the Western Roman Empire'' (2002), p. 182</ref>\n\nPagan-related edicts issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:\n* The death penalty for those performing pagan [[sacrifice]]s<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirsch|first1=Jonathan|title=God against the gods : the history of the war between monotheism and polytheism|date=2005|publisher=Penguin Compass|location=New York|isbn=0142196339|page=200}}</ref>\n* The banning of sacrifices<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.2 & 16.10.6</ref>\n* The closing of pagan temples<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.10.4 & 16.10.6</ref>\n* Edicts against soothsayers and magicians<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 9.16.4, 9.16.5 & 9.16.6</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nAlthough often considered an [[Arianism|Arian]],<ref>Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284\u2013602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118</ref> Constantius ultimately preferred a third, compromise version that lay somewhere in between [[Arianism]] and the [[Nicene Creed]], retrospectively called [[Semi-Arianism]].<ref>Pelikan, J.J., ''The Christian Tradition'' (1989), pp. 209\u201310</ref><ref>Gaddis, M., ''There is No Crime for Those who Have Christ'' (2005), p. 92</ref> During his reign he attempted to mold the Christian church to follow this compromise position, convening several Christian councils. The most notable of these were the [[Council of Rimini]] and its twin at [[Silifke|Seleucia]], which met in 359 and 360 respectively. \"Unfortunately for his memory the theologians whose advice he took were ultimately discredited and the malcontents whom he pressed to conform emerged victorious,\" writes the historian [[A.H.M. Jones]]. \"The great councils of 359\u201360 are therefore not reckoned [[Ecumenical council|ecumenical]] in the tradition of the church, and Constantius II is not remembered as a restorer of unity, but as a [[Arianism|heretic]] who arbitrarily imposed his will on the church.\"<ref name=\"Jones, A.H.M 1986 p. 118\">Jones, A.H.M, ''The Later Roman Empire, 284\u2013602: a Social, Economic and Administrative Survey'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University, 1986), p. 118.</ref>\n\nChristian-related edicts issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:\n* Exemption from compulsory public service for the clergy<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.9</ref>\n* Exemption from compulsory public service for the sons of clergy<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.11</ref>\n* Tax exemptions for clergy and their servants,<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.8</ref> and later for their family<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.14</ref>\n* Clergy and the issue of private property<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.15, 12.1.49 & 8.4.7</ref>\n* Bishops exempted from being tried in secular courts<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.2.12</ref>\n* Christian prostitutes only able to be bought by Christians<ref>[[Codex Theodosianus]] 15.8.1</ref>\n\n===Judaism===\nJudaism faced some severe restrictions under Constantius, who seems to have followed an anti-Jewish policy in line with that of his father.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1\">Sch\u00e4fer, P., ''The History of the Jews in the Greco-Roman World'' (2003), pp. 180\u20131</ref> Early in his reign, Constantius issued a double edict in concert with his brothers limiting the ownership of slaves by Jewish people<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\">[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.9.2</ref> and banning marriages between Jews and Christian women.<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\"/> A later edict issued by Constantius after becoming sole emperor decreed that a person who was proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism would have all of his property confiscated by the state.<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7\">[[Codex Theodosianus]] 16.8.7</ref> However, Constantius' actions in this regard may not have been so much to do with Jewish religion as with Jewish business\u2014apparently, privately owned Jewish businesses were often in competition with state-owned businesses. As a result, Constantius may have sought to provide an advantage to state-owned businesses by limiting the skilled workers and slaves available to Jewish businesses.<ref name=\"Sch\u00e4fer, P. 2003 pp. 180-1\"/>\n\nJew-related edicts issued by Constantius (by himself or with others) included:\n* Weaving women who moved from working for the government to working for Jews must be restored to the government<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\"/>\n* Jews may not marry Christian women<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\"/>\n* Jews may not attempt to convert Christian women<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\"/>\n* Any non-Jewish slave bought by a Jew will be confiscated by the state<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\"/>\n* If a Jew attempts to circumcise a non-Jewish slave, the slave will be freed and the Jew shall face capital punishment<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\"/>\n* Any Christian slaves owned by a Jew will be taken away and freed<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.9.2\"/>\n* A person who is proven to have converted from Christianity to Judaism shall have their property confiscated by the state<ref name=\"Codex Theodosianus 16.8.7\"/>\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Nummus of Constantius II (YORYM 2014 395 59) obverse.jpg|thumb|left|A ''[[nummus]]'' of Constantius II]]\nConstantius II is a particularly difficult figure to judge properly due to the hostility of most sources toward him. A. H. M. Jones writes that Constantius \"appears in the pages of [[Ammianus Marcellinus|Ammianus]] as a conscientious emperor but a vain and stupid man, an easy prey to flatterers. He was timid and suspicious, and interested persons could easily play on his fears for their own advantage.\"<ref>Jones, A. H. M., ''Later Roman Empire'', p. 116.</ref> However, Kent and M. and A. Hirmer suggest that Constantius \"has suffered at the hands of unsympathetic authors, ecclesiastical and civil alike. To orthodox churchmen he was a bigoted supporter of the Arian heresy, to [[Julian (emperor)|Julian the Apostate]] and the many who have subsequently taken his part he was a murderer, a tyrant and inept as a ruler\".<ref name=\"Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54\">Kent, J.P.C., Hirmer, M. & Hirmer, A. ''Roman Coins'' (1978), p. 54</ref> They go on to add, \"Most contemporaries seem in fact to have held him in high esteem, and he certainly inspired loyalty in a way his brother could not\".<ref name=\"Kent, J.P.C. 1978 p. 54\"/> In the military sphere, the campaigns of Constantius and his subordinates on the Rhine and Danube frontiers in the late 350s restored stability to those regions after the troubles caused by Magnentius' revolt.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{Ahnentafel\n|align=center|collapsed=no\n|title=Ancestors of Constantius II\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.'''Constantius II'''\n|2= 2.

In 340 Constantine II invaded Italy.<ref name=\"Victor, 41:21\"/> Constans, at that time in [[Dacia]], detached and sent a select and disciplined body of his Illyrian troops, stating that he would follow them in person with the remainder of his forces.<ref name=\"Gibbon, Ch. 18\"/> Constantine was eventually trapped at [[Aquileia]], where he died, leaving Constans to inherit all of his brother\u2019s former territories \u2013 [[Hispania]], [[Roman Britain|Britannia]] and [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].<ref name=\"Eutropius, 10:9\"/>\n\n{{Coin image box 2 singles\n| header = A [[Nummus]] of Constans\n| image_left = Image:Nummus of Constans (YORYM 2001 11574) obverse.jpg\n| image_right= Image:Nummus of Constans (YORYM 2001 11574) reverse.jpg\n| caption_left = Obverse showing Constans portrait\n| caption_right = Reverse showing Constans on a galley\n| width_left = 120\n| width_right = 120\n| footer = \n| position = left\n| margin = 0\n}}\nConstans began his reign in an energetic fashion.<ref name=\"Eutropius, 10:9\"/> In 341-42, he led a successful campaign against the [[Franks]], and in the early months of 343 he visited [[Roman Britain|Britain]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The source for this visit, [[Julius Firmicus Maternus]], does not provide a reason, but the quick movement and the danger involved in crossing the [[English Channel|channel]] in the winter months suggests it was in response to a military emergency, possibly to repel the [[Picts]] and [[Gaels|Scots]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nRegarding religion, Constans was tolerant of [[Judaism]] and promulgated an edict banning pagan sacrifices in 341.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He suppressed [[Donatism]] in Africa and supported [[Nicene Christianity|Nicene orthodoxy]] against [[Arianism]], which was championed by his brother Constantius.

All-star teams popped up, and with them, the creation of the United States All-Star Federation (USASF). ESPN first broadcast the National High School Cheerleading Competition nationwide in 1983. Cheerleading organizations such as the American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Advisors (AACCA), founded in 1987, started applying universal safety standards to decrease the number of injuries and prevent dangerous stunts, pyramids, and tumbling passes from being included in the cheerleading routines.<ref name=\"AACCA\">{{cite web | title=About the AACCA | url=http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061206110741/http://www.aacca.org/about.asp | archivedate=2006-12-06 | accessdate=2007-01-11 | deadurl=yes | df= }}</ref> In 2003, the National Council for Spirit Safety and Education (NCSSE) was formed to offer safety training for youth, school, all-star, and college coaches. The NCAA requires college cheer coaches to successfully complete a nationally recognized safety-training program. The NCSSE or AACCA certification programs are both recognized by the NCAA.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}\n\nEven with its athletic and competitive development, cheerleading at the school level has retained its ties to its spirit leading traditions. Cheerleaders are quite often seen as ambassadors for their schools, and leaders among the student body. At the college level, cheerleaders are often invited to help at university fundraisers and events.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.varsity.com/event/1147/fundraising_ideas_cheerleading|title=Being a Cheerleader \u2013 Fundraising|website=Varsity.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nCheerleading is very closely associated with [[American football]] and [[basketball]]. Sports such as [[association football]] (soccer), [[ice hockey]], [[volleyball]], [[baseball]], and [[wrestling]] will sometimes sponsor cheerleading squads. The ICC Twenty20 Cricket World Cup in South Africa in 2007 was the first international cricket event to have cheerleaders. The [[Miami Marlins|Florida Marlins]] were the first [[Major League Baseball]] team to have a cheerleading team. Debuting in 2003, the \"Marlin Mermaids\" gained national exposure, and have influenced other MLB teams to develop their own cheer/dance squads.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n===Evolution===\nCompetitive cheerleading is scored subjectively based on components including, but not limited to, the [[Cheering|cheer]] itself,  dance/choreography, [[List of cheerleading stunts|pyramids]], [[List of cheerleading stunts|stunt]]ing, and [[Tumbling (gymnastics)|tumbling]]. In order to prevent injuries, there are certain rules that cheerleading teams have to follow according to their level (high school, all-star, or college). According to the Encyclopedia of Sports Medicine, there are two purposes of cheerleading - to cheer on the sidelines for other athletes, and to be a \"highly skilled competing athlete.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of sports medicine|last=|first=|date=2011|publisher=SAGE Publications|others=Micheli, Lyle J., 1940-|isbn=978-1412961158|location=Thousand Oaks, Calif.|pages=254|oclc=640072379}}</ref>\n\nAlong with this evolution to the sport's structure, there have been significant advancements made to the typical cheerleading uniform. What began as the classic sweater and mid-calf pleated skirt uniform has now come to incorporate materials that allow for stretch and flexibility. Uniform changes are a result of the changing culture from the 1930s to  modern day.\n\nCheerleading may seem like a light-hearted activity to some, but injuries that can come from practice or a competition can be severe if the [[athlete]] is not properly trained. There have been many catastrophic injuries from cheer, especially from tumbling and stunting. Because of the lack of studies on injuries in competitive cheerleading, many injuries that happen could be avoided. Most studies in [[sports medicine]] pertaining to cheerleading are focused on whether it is a sport or not.<ref name=\"Golden, Suzi J. 2004, p. 5\"/>\n\n==Types of teams in the United States today==\n\n[[File:University of Memphis Coed Cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|University of Memphis Cheerleaders performing a Co-ed double Cupie]]\n\n===School-sponsored===\nMost American middle schools, high schools, and colleges have organized cheerleading squads. Many colleges offer cheerleading scholarships for students. A cheerleading team may compete locally, regionally, or nationally, as well as cheer for sporting events and encourage audience participation.  Cheerleading is quickly becoming a year-round activity, starting with tryouts during the spring semester of the preceding school year. Teams may attend organized summer cheerleading camps and practices to improve skills and create routines for competition.\n\nStudent cheerleaders compete with recreational-style routine at competitions year-round. Teams practice intensely for competition and perform a routine no longer than 2 minutes and 30 seconds. Like other school-level athletes, teams compete to win league titles, and move on to bigger competitions with the hopes of reaching a national competition. The advantages to a school squad versus an all-star squad is cheering at various sporting events.\n\nThe tryout process can sometimes take place over a multiple day period. The cheerleading coach will arrange for a cheerleading clinic, during which basic materials are taught or reviewed before the final day of tryouts. The clinic gives returning cheerleaders and new cheerleaders an equal chance of becoming familiar with the material. Skills that are necessary to be a cheerleader include jumps, tumbling, motions, and dance ability. Tryouts often take place during the spring, so that the coach has the squad chosen in time to attend summer camp as a team.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=November 2016}}\n\n====Middle school====\n[[File:LaBelle Middle School Cheerleaders Banner.jpg|thumb|[[LaBelle, Florida|LaBelle Middle School]] cheerleaders displayed in the school [[cafeteria]]]]\n[[Middle school]] cheerleading evolved shortly after high school squads were created. In middle school, cheerleading squads serve the same purpose, and follow the same rules as high school squads.  Squads cheer for basketball teams, football teams, and other sports teams in their school. Squads also perform at pep rallies and compete against other local schools from the area.  Cheerleading in middle school sometimes can be a two-season activity: fall and winter. However, many middle school cheer squads will go year-round like high school squads. Middle school cheerleaders use the same cheerleading movements as their older counterparts, yet they perform less extreme stunts. These stunts range from preps, thigh stands, and extensions, to harder one-legged stunts.\n\n====High school====\n[[File:Mercer Island High School Cheerleaders.jpg|left|thumb|275px|High school cheerleaders]]\nIn high school, there are usually two squads per school: [[varsity team|varsity]] and a [[junior varsity team|junior varsity]].  High school cheerleading contains aspects of school spirit as well as competition. These squads have become part of a year-round cycle. Starting with tryouts in the spring, year-round practice, cheering on teams in the [[Autumn|fall]] and [[winter]], and participating in cheerleading competitions. Most squads practice at least three days a week for about two hours each practice during the summer. Many teams also attend separate tumbling sessions outside of practice. During the school year, cheerleading is usually practiced five- to six-days-a-week. During competition season, it often becomes seven days with practice twice a day sometimes. The school spirit aspect of cheerleading involves cheering, supporting, and \"pumping up\" the crowd at football games, basketball games, and even at wrestling meets. Along with this, they perform at pep rallies, and bring school spirit to  other students. In May 2009, the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] released the results of their first true high school participation study. They estimated that the number of high school cheerleaders from public high schools is around 394,700.<ref>[http://www.nfhs.org/web/2009/05/survey_indicates_nearly_400000.aspx NFHS.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608110413/http://www.nfhs.org/web/2009/05/survey_indicates_nearly_400000.aspx |date=June 8, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThere are different cheerleading organizations that put on competitions; some of the major ones include state and regional competitions. Many high schools will often host cheerleading competitions, bringing in IHSA judges. The regional competitions are qualifiers for national competitions, such as the [http://www.uca.varsity.com/ UCA (Universal Cheerleaders Association)] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]] every year.<ref>Universal Cheerleaders Association (UCA) 2008. 7 December 2008.

For a list of rules, visit [http://www.aacca.org/ AACCA (American Association of Cheerleading Coaches and Administrators)]. All high school coaches are required to attend an IHSA rules meeting at the beginning of the season. This ensures their knowledge of changed rules and their compliance with these rules.\n\n===College===\n[[File:Flick-Gator Cheerleaders.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Collegiate cheerleaders for the [[University of Florida]] perform a high splits pyramid during a [[Florida Gators football|Gators]] [[college football]] game]]\n\nMost American universities have a cheerleading squad to cheer for football, basketball, volleyball, and soccer. Most college squads tend to be large coed although in recent years; all-girl and small coed college squads have increased rapidly.\n\nCollege squads perform more difficult stunts which include pyramids, as well as flipping and twisting basket tosses.\n\n===Youth league/athletic association===\n[[File:YouthCheerleadingPompons.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Youth cheerleaders during a football [[halftime show]]. Youth cheer\u2014[[Secondary school|high school]] ages and younger\u2014make up the vast majority of cheerleaders and cheer teams.]]\n\nOrganizations that sponsor youth cheer teams usually sponsor either youth league [[American football|football]] or [[basketball]] teams as well. This allows for the two, under the same sponsor, to be intermingled. Both teams have the same mascot name and the cheerleaders will perform at their football or basketball games. Examples of such sponsors include [[Pop Warner Little Scholars|Pop Warner]] and Pasco Police Athletic League (PPAL). The [[YMCA]] (Young Men's Christian Association) is also a well-known sponsor for youth cheerleading leagues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livebinders.com/play/play?id=301593|title=Cheerleading|website=Livebinders.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===All-star===\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2016}}\nDuring the early 1980s, cheerleading squads not associated with a school or sports leagues, whose main objective was competition, began to emerge. The first organization to call themselves all-stars and go to competitions were the Q94 Rockers from [[Richmond, Virginia]], founded in 1982.<ref name=\"ACFeb2007\">{{Cite journal | last = Smith | first = Jennifer Ren\u00e8e | title = The All-Star Chronicles | journal = American Cheerleader | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 40\u201342 |date=February 2007 }}</ref>  All-star teams competing prior to 1987 were placed into the same divisions as teams that represented schools and sports leagues. In 1986, the National Cheerleaders Association (NCA) addressed this situation by creating a separate division for teams lacking a sponsoring school or athletic association, calling it the All-Star Division and debuting it at their 1987 competitions. As the popularity of this type of team grew, more and more of them were formed, attending competitions sponsored by many different organizations and companies, each using its own set of rules, regulations, and divisions. This situation became a concern to gym owners because the inconsistencies caused coaches to keep their routines in a constant state of flux, detracting from time that could be better utilized for developing skills and providing personal attention to their athletes. More importantly, because the various companies were constantly vying for a competitive edge, safety standards had become more and more lax. In some cases, unqualified coaches and inexperienced squads were attempting dangerous stunts as a result of these expanded sets of rules.<ref name=\"varsity2004\">{{cite web | title = The Cheerleading Worlds Administered by the USASF | publisher = Varsity Brands, Inc. | url =http://www.varsity.com/index.asp?article=1514 | accessdate = 2007-09-20 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090203090219/http://www.varsity.com/index.asp?article=1514 | archivedate = 2009-02-03 | df =  }}</ref>\n\nThe USASF was formed in 2003 by the competition companies to act as the national governing body for all star cheerleading and to create a standard set of rules and judging standards to be followed by all competitions sanctioned by the Federation, ultimately leading to the Cheerleading Worlds. The USASF hosted the first Cheerleading Worlds on April 24, 2004.<ref name=\"varsity2004\"/> In 2009, the first All-Level Worlds was held. It included teams from all levels, with each winner continuing to the online championships, where teams from across the nation competed to win the Worlds Title. At the same time, cheerleading coaches from all over the country organized themselves for the same rule making purpose, calling themselves the National All Star Cheerleading Coaches Congress (NACCC). In 2005, the NACCC was absorbed by the USASF to become their rule making body.<ref name=\"ACFeb2007\"/> In late 2006, the [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF]] facilitated the creation of the International All-Star Federation (IASF).\n\n[[File:ScaleCheer.jpg|right|800px|thumb|paramount cheerleaders doing a scale|Competitive cheer - Paramount Cheerleaders doing a scale]]\n\n{{As of|2012}}, all-star cheerleading as sanctioned by the USASF involves a squad of 6\u201336 females and/or males. All-star differs from sideline cheerleading because all-star focuses on performing , while sideline cheers for others sport such as football or basketball. All-star is competitive teams that perform a routine for the purpose of entertainment against other teams, typically in the same divisions, to try to win.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Igawa|first=Momoko|last2=Kato|first2=Makoto|date=2017-09-20|title=A new species of hermit crab, Diogenes heteropsammicola (Crustacea, Decapoda, Anomura, Diogenidae), replaces a mutualistic sipunculan in a walking coral symbiosis|journal=PLOS ONE|language=en|volume=12|issue=9|pages=e0184311|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0184311|issn=1932-6203|pmc=5606932|pmid=28931020}}</ref> The squad prepares year-round for many different competition appearances, but they only actually perform for up to 2\u00bd minutes during their team's routines. The numbers of competitions a team participates in varies from team to team, but generally, most teams tend to participate in eight to twelve competitions a year. These competitions include locals, which are normally taken place in school gymnasiums or local venues, nationals, hosted in big venues all around the U.S. with national champions, and the Cheerleading Worlds, taken place at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. During a competition routine, a squad performs carefully choreographed stunting, tumbling, jumping, and dancing to their own custom music. Teams create their routines to an eight-count system and apply that to the music so that the team members execute the elements with precise timing and synchronization.\n\nThere are many different organizations that host their own state and national competitions. Some major companies include: Universal Spirit, AmeriCheer, Cheersport, Planet Spirit, Eastern Cheer and Dance Association, and [[The JAM Brands]]. This means that many gyms within the same area could be state and national champions for the same year and never have competed against each other. Currently, there is no system in place that awards only one state or national title.\n\nJudges at the competition watch closely for illegal moves from the group or any individual member. Here, an illegal move is something that is not allowed in that division due to difficulty and/or safety restrictions. They look out for deductions, or things that go wrong, such as a dropped stunt. They also look for touch downs in tumbling for deductions. More generally, judges look at the difficulty and execution of jumps, stunts and tumbling, synchronization, creativity, the sharpness of the motions, showmanship, and overall routine execution.\n\nAll-star cheerleaders are placed into divisions, which are grouped based upon age, size of the team, gender of participants, and ability level. The age levels vary from under 4 year of age to 18 years and over. The divisions used by the [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF/IASF]] are currently Tiny, Mini, Youth, Junior, Junior International, Junior Coed, Senior, Senior Coed, Special Needs, and Open International. It originally began with \"all girl\" teams and later co-ed teams began to gain popularity. That being said, the all-girl squad remains the most prevalent.<ref name=\"USASF_Ages_07-08\">{{cite web | title = USASF All-Star Cheer Divisions for 2007\u20132008 | url =https://secure.usasf.net/Documents/Rules/07-08/Age%20Grid%2007-08%20--%20Rev%203-23-07.pdf | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070709223035/https://secure.usasf.net/Documents/Rules/07-08/Age%20Grid%2007-08%20--%20Rev%203-23-07.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-07-09 | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-06-29 }}</ref>\n\nIf a team places high enough at selected [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF/IASF]] sanctioned national competitions, they could be included in the [[U.S. All Star Federation|Cheerleading Worlds]] and compete against teams from all over the world, as well as receive money for placing.<ref name=\"nw20007\"/> Each team receives a bid from another cheerleading company and goes in the name of that company. One must get a bid from a company in order to compete at the Cheerleading Worlds. For example, a team could get a bid from Cheersport, and they compete as a team representing that company. Cheerleading companies give out three types of bids to go to Cheerleading Worlds, Full Paid Bid, Partial Bid, or an Un-paid bid.

In response, a new subgenre of exploitation films suddenly sprang up with titles such as ''[[The Cheerleaders]]'' (1972), ''[[The Swinging Cheerleaders]]'' (1974), ''Revenge of the Cheerleaders'' (1975), ''The Pom Pom Girls'' (1976), ''[[Satan's Cheerleaders]]'' (1977), ''Cheerleaders Beach Party'' (1978), ''Cheerleaders's Wild Weekend'' (1979), and ''[[Gimme an 'F']]'' (1984). In addition to R-rated sex comedies and horror films, cheerleaders became a staple of the adult film industry, starting with ''[[Debbie Does Dallas]]'' (1978) and its four sequels.\n\nOn television, the made-for-TV movie ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders'' (which aired January 14, 1979) starring [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] was a highly rated success, spawning the 1980 sequel ''The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders II''.\n\nThe Dallas squad was in high demand during the late 1970s with frequent appearances on network specials, awards shows, variety programs, commercials, the game show ''[[Family Feud]]'' and TV series such as ''[[The Love Boat]]''. The sci-fi sitcom ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' also based a 1979 episode around the [[Denver Broncos]] cheerleaders with Mork ([[Robin Williams]]) trying out for the squad.\n\n''[[The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom]]'' (1993) is a [[Television film|TV movie]] which dramatized the true story of [[Wanda Holloway]], the Texas mother whose obsession with her daughter's cheerleading career made headline news. Another lurid TV movie based on a true story, ''[[Fab Five: The Texas Cheerleader Scandal]]'' was produced in 2008.\n\nCheerleading's increasing popularity in recent decades has made it a prominent feature in high-school themed movies and television shows. The 2000 film ''[[Bring It On (film)|Bring It On]]'', about a [[San Diego]] high school cheerleading squad called \"The Toros\", starred real-life former cheerleader [[Kirsten Dunst]].  ''Bring It On'' was a surprise hit and earned nearly $70 million domestically. It spawned five direct-to-video [[sequel]]s: ''[[Bring It On Again]]'' (2004), ''[[Bring It On: All or Nothing]]'' (2006), ''[[Bring It On: In It to Win It]]'' (2007), ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bring It On: Worldwide Cheersmack]]'' (2017). The first ''Bring It On'' was followed by the cheerleader caper-comedy, ''[[Sugar & Spice]]'' (2001) and a string of campy horror/action films such as ''Cheerleader Ninjas'' (2002), ''Cheerleader Autopsy'', ''Cheerleader Massacre'' (both 2003), ''Chainsaw Cheerleaders'', and ''Ninja Cheerleaders'' (both 2008).\n\nIn 2006, [[Hayden Panettiere]], star of ''Bring It On: All or Nothing'', took another cheerleading role as [[Claire Bennet]], the cheerleader with an accelerated healing factor on [[NBC]]'s hit [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] [[TV series]] ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'', launching cheerleading back into the limelight of pop culture. Claire was the main focus of the show's first story arc, featuring the popular catchphrase, \"Save the cheerleader, save the world\". Her prominent, protagonist role in ''Heroes'' was supported by a strong fan-base and provided a positive image for high school cheerleading.\n\nIn 2009, Panettiere starred again as a cheerleader, this time as Beth Cooper in the [[I Love You, Beth Cooper (film)|film adaptation]] of the novel ''[[I Love You, Beth Cooper]]''.\n\nIn 2006, the reality show ''[[Cheerleader Nation]]'' was featured on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television channel. ''Cheerleader Nation'' is a 60-minute television series based on the [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Lexington, Kentucky)|Paul Laurence Dunbar High School]] cheerleading team's ups and downs on the way to nationals, of which they are the three-time champions. The show also believes that cheerleading is tough. The show takes place in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].\n\nThe 2007 series ''[[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team]]'' shows the process of getting on the pro squad of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. Everything from initial tryouts to workout routines and the difficulties involved is shown.\n\n''[[Fired Up!]]'', a teen comedy about cheerleading camp, was released by [[Screen Gems]] in 2009. In the supernatural horror-comedy ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' (2009), [[Megan Fox]] plays a demonically possessed high school cheerleader. Also that year, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] signed music video and film director [[Bille Woodruff]] (''[[Barbershop (film)|Barbershop]]'', ''[[Honey (2003 film)|Honey]]'') to direct the fifth film in the ''Bring It On'' series titled ''[[Bring It On: Fight to the Finish]]''. The film stars [[Christina Milian]] (who previously played cheerleaders in ''[[Love Don't Cost a Thing (film)|Love Don't Cost a Thing]]'' and ''[[Man of the House (2005 film)|Man of the House]]'') and Rachelle Brook Smith, and was released directly to DVD and Blu-ray on September 1, 2009.\n\nThe television series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' (2009-2015) featured [[Dianna Agron]] as [[Quinn Fabray]], the captain of her high school cheerleading squad, the Cheerios. Quinn becomes pregnant, leading to her expulsion from the squad, but two of the other Cheerios, [[Santana Lopez]] and [[Brittany Pierce]] also feature heavily in the show. In \"[[The Power of Madonna]]\" [[Kurt Hummel]] joins the Cheerios along with [[Mercedes Jones]].\n\n[[The CW|The CW Television Network]] created the short-lived ''[[Hellcats]]'' series (2010\u201311). This drama was about the ups and downs of being a college cheerleader. It starred [[Aly Michalka]] as Marty (a former gymnast forced to become a cheerleader after her academic scholarship is canceled) and [[Ashley Tisdale]] from ''[[High School Musical]]''.\n\nMore recent films include the teen sex-comedy ''#1 Cheerleader Camp'' (2010) and the horror-comedy ''[[All Cheerleaders Die]]'' (2013), a remake of an earlier [[All Cheerleaders Die (2001 film)|2001 film of the same name]].\n\n;Video games\nNintendo has released a pair of video games in Japan for the [[Nintendo DS]], ''[[Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan]]'' and its sequel ''[[Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan 2|Moero! Nekketsu Rhythm Damashii]]'' that star teams of male cheer squads, or [[\u014cendan|Ouendan]] that practice a form of cheerleading. Each of the games' most difficult modes replaces the male characters with female cheer squads that dress in western cheerleading uniforms. The games task the cheer squads with assisting people in desperate need of help by cheering them on and giving them the motivation to succeed. There are also a ''All Star Cheerleader'' and ''[[We Cheer]]'' for the Wii in which one does routines at competitions with the Wiimote & Nunchuck. ''All Star Cheerleader'' is also available for Nintendo DS.\n\n==Cheerleading in Canada==\n<br />\n[[File:School. West Hill High School Cheer Leaders BAnQ P48S1P09553.jpg|thumb|High school cheerleaders in [[Montreal]] in 1943]]\nCheerleading in Canada is rising in popularity among the youth in co-curricular programs. Cheerleading has grown from the sidelines to a competitive activity throughout the world and in particular Canada. Cheerleading has a few streams in Canadian sports culture. It is available at the middle-school, high-school, collegiate, and best known for all-star. There are multiple regional, provincial, and national championship opportunities for all athletes participating in cheerleading. Canada does not have provincial teams, just a national program referred to as CCU or Team Canada. Their first year as a national team was in 2009 when they represented Canada at the International Cheer Union World Cheerleading Championships [[International Cheer Union]] (ICU).<ref>{{cite web|title=CCU \"About\"|url=http://www.teamcanadacheer.com/index.php?componentName=AwardSection&scid=73773|accessdate=28 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Canada as a competition===\nThere is no official governing body for Canadian cheerleading. The rules and guidelines for cheerleading used in Canada are the ones set out by the [[U.S. All Star Federation|USASF]]. However, there are many organizations in Canada that put on competitions and have separate and individual rules and scoresheets for each competition. Cheer Evolution is the largest cheerleading and dance organization for Canada. They hold many competitions as well as provide a competition for bids to Worlds. There are other organizations such as the Ontario Cheerleading Federation (Ontario), Power Cheerleading Association (Ontario), Kicks Athletics (Quebec), and the International Cheer Alliance (Vancouver). There are over forty recognized competitive gym clubs with numerous teams that compete at competitions across Canada.<ref>{{cite web|title=Find A Club Near You|url=http://canadiancheer.com/find-a-club-near-you/|publisher=Cheer Evolution|accessdate=28 March 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503170459/http://canadiancheer.com/find-a-club-near-you/|archivedate=3 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Canada at the World Championships of Cheerleading (USASF/ICU)===\nThere are two world championship competitions that Canada participates in. There is the ICU World Championships where the national teams compete against each other and then there are the club team world championships. These club teams are referred to as \"all-star\" teams who compete at the USASF World Championships of Cheerleading. This is where teams must have earned a bid from their own country to attend. National team members who compete at the ICU Worlds can also compete with their \"all-star club\" teams.<ref>{{cite news|title=Canada looks for fourth straight gold medal|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/canada-looks-for-fourth-straight-cheerleading-gold-medal-1.798435|accessdate=2 April 2013|date=19 April 2012}}</ref> Although athletes can compete in both [[International Cheer Union]] (ICU) and USASF, crossovers between teams at each individual competition are not permitted. Teams compete against the other teams from their countries on the first day of competition and the top three teams from each country in each division continue to finals. At the end of finals, the top team scoring the highest for their country earns the \"Nations Cup\". Canada has multiple teams across their country that compete in the USASF Cheerleading Worlds Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=United States All Star Federation|url=http://www.usasf.net/|publisher=USASF|accessdate=2 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Cheer Union]] (ICU) is built of 103 countries that compete against each other in four divisions; Coed Premier, All-girl Premier, Coed Elite, and All-girl Elite. Canada has a national team ran by the Canadian Cheer Union (CCU). Their Coed Elite Level 5 Team and their All-girl Elite Level 5 team are 4-time world champions. They are found from all over the country. In 2013, they added two more teams to their roster. A new division that will compete head-to-head with the United States: in both the All-girl and Coed Premier Level 6 divisions. Members tryout and are selected on the basis of their skills and potential to succeed. Athletes are selected from all over.

The pictures came to the attention of writer [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], who used them to illustrate an article on [[fairy|fairies]] he had been commissioned to write for the Christmas 1920 edition of ''[[Strand Magazine|The Strand Magazine]]''. Doyle, as a [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualist]], was enthusiastic about the photographs, and interpreted them as clear and visible evidence of [[psychic]] phenomena. Public reaction was mixed; some accepted the images as genuine, others believed that they had been faked.\n\nInterest in the Cottingley Fairies gradually declined after 1921. Both girls married and lived abroad for a time after they grew up, yet the photographs continued to hold the public imagination. In 1966 a reporter from the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper traced Elsie, who had by then returned to the UK. Elsie left open the possibility that she believed she had photographed her thoughts, and the media once again became interested in the story.\n\nIn the early 1980s Elsie and Frances admitted that the photographs were faked, using cardboard cutouts of fairies copied from a popular children's book of the time, but Frances maintained that the fifth and final photograph was genuine. The photographs and two of the cameras used are on display in the [[National Science and Media Museum]] in Bradford, England.\n\n==1917 photographs==\n[[File:CottingleyBeck.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photo|Cottingley Beck, where Frances and Elsie claimed to have seen the fairies]]\nIn mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother\u2014both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa\u2014were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of [[Cottingley, Bradford|Cottingley]] in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg [[Film format#Still photography film formats|quarter-plate]]. The girls returned about 30&nbsp;minutes later, \"triumphant\".{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=97\u201398|ps=none}}\n\nElsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the [[photographic plate]] he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a {{convert|1|ft|cm|adj=on|disp=x|-tall (|)}} gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \"nothing but a prank\",{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=97|ps=none}} and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again.{{sfnp|Prashad|2008|p=42|ps=none}} His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=97|ps=none}}\n\n{{Quote box |width=25em |align=right |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=left |quote=I am learning French, Geometry, Cookery and Algebra at school now.

Elsie took that one.|source=Letter from Frances Griffiths to a friend in South Africa{{sfnp|Prashad|2008|p=40|ps=none}}}}\n\nTowards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in [[Cape Town]], South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\"{{sfnp|Prashad|2008|p=40|ps=none}}\n\nThe photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the [[Theosophical Society]] in Bradford. The lecture that evening was on \"fairy life\", and at the end of the meeting Polly Wright showed the two fairy photographs taken by her daughter and niece to the speaker. As a result, the photographs were displayed at the society's annual conference in [[Harrogate]], held a few months later. There they came to the attention of a leading member of the society, Edward Gardner.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=98\u201399|ps=none}} One of the central beliefs of theosophy is that humanity is undergoing a cycle of evolution, towards increasing \"perfection\", and Gardner recognised the potential significance of the photographs for the movement:\n{{quote|... the fact that two young girls had not only been able to see fairies, which others had done, but had actually for the first time ever been able to materialise them at a density sufficient for their images to be recorded on a photographic plate, meant that it was possible that the next cycle of evolution was underway.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=382|ps=none}}}}\n\n==Initial examinations==\nGardner sent the prints along with the original glass-plate negatives to Harold Snelling, a photography expert.

Doyle contacted Gardner in June 1920 to determine the background to the photographs, and wrote to Elsie and her father to request permission from the latter to use the prints in his article. Arthur Wright was \"obviously impressed\" that Doyle was involved, and gave his permission for publication, but he refused payment on the grounds that, if genuine, the images should not be \"soiled\" by money.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=99\u2013100|ps=none}}\n\nGardner and Doyle sought a second expert opinion from the photographic company [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]]. Several of the company's technicians examined the enhanced prints, and although they agreed with Snelling that the pictures \"showed no signs of being faked\", they concluded that \"this could not be taken as conclusive evidence&nbsp;... that they were authentic photographs of fairies\".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=384|ps=none}} Kodak declined to issue a certificate of authenticity.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=101|ps=none}} Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians might not have examined the photographs entirely objectively, observing that one had commented \"after all, as fairies couldn't be true, the photographs must have been faked somehow\".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}} The prints were also examined by another photographic company, [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]], who reported unequivocally that there was \"some evidence of faking\".{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}} Gardner and Doyle, perhaps rather optimistically, interpreted the results of the three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs' authenticity and one against.{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}}\n\nDoyle also showed the photographs to the [[physicist]] and pioneering [[parapsychology|psychical researcher]] [[Sir Oliver Lodge]], who believed the photographs to be fake.

Frances was by then living with her parents in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]],{{sfnp|Smith|1997|p=385|ps=none}} but Elsie's father told Gardner that he had been so certain the photographs were fakes that while the girls were away he searched their bedroom and the area around the beck (stream), looking for scraps of pictures or cutouts, but found nothing \"incriminating\".{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=102|ps=none}}\n\n[[File:CottingleyFairies3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Photo|''Frances and the Leaping Fairy'', the third photograph]]\nGardner believed the Wright family to be honest and respectable. To place the matter of the photographs' authenticity beyond doubt, he returned to Cottingley at the end of July with two Kodak Cameo cameras and 24&nbsp;secretly marked photographic plates. Frances was invited to stay with the Wright family during the school summer holiday so that she and Elsie could take more pictures of the fairies.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=102|ps=none}} Gardner described his briefing in his 1945 ''Fairies: A Book of Real Fairies'':\n{{quote|I went off, to Cottingley again, taking the two cameras and plates from London, and met the family and explained to the two girls the simple working of the cameras, giving one each to keep. The cameras were loaded, and my final advice was that they need go up to the glen only on fine days as they had been accustomed to do before and ''tice'' the fairies, as they called their way of attracting them, and see what they could get. I suggested only the most obvious and easy precautions about lighting and distance, for I knew it was essential they should feel free and unhampered and have no burden of responsibility. If nothing came of it all, I told them, they were not to mind a bit.<ref name=Cooper/>}}\nUntil 19 August the weather was unsuitable for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, ''Frances and the Leaping Fairy'', Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, ''Fairy offering Posy of [[Campanula rotundifolia|Harebells]] to Elsie'', shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing on a branch, and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, ''Fairies and Their Sun-Bath''.{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|pp=102\u2013103|ps=none}}\n\nThe plates were packed in cotton wool and returned to Gardner in London, who sent an \"ecstatic\" telegram to Doyle, by then in [[Melbourne]].{{sfnp|Magnusson|2006|p=103|ps=none}} Doyle wrote back:\n{{quote|My heart was gladdened when out here in far Australia I had your note and the three wonderful pictures which are confirmatory of our published results.

''out of history of activities of VChK, OGPU, NKVD, MGB'']. FSB archives.{{ru icon}}</ref> On December 6, the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom) strategized how to persuade government workers to strike across Russia. They decided that a special commission was needed to implement the \"most energetically revolutionary\" measures. [[Felix Dzerzhinsky]] (the Iron Felix) was appointed as Director and invited the participation of the following individuals: [[Vasiliy Averin|V. K. Averin]], [[V. N. Vasilevsky]], [[D. G. Yevseyev]], [[N. A. Zhydelev]], [[Ivan Ksenofontov|I. K. Ksenofontov]], [[Grigoriy Ordzhonikidze|G. K. Ordjonikidze]], [[Yakov Peters|Ya. Kh. Peters]], [[K. A. Peterson]], [[Valentin Trifonov|V. A. Trifonov]].\n\nOn December 7, 1917, all invited except Zhydelev and Vasilevsky gathered in the [[Smolny Institute]] to discuss the competence and structure of the commission to combat counterrevolution and sabotage. The obligations of the commission were: \"to liquidate to the root all of the counterrevolutionary and sabotage activities and all attempts to them in all of Russia, to hand over counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs to the [[revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revolutionary tribunals]], develop measures to combat them and relentlessly apply them in real world applications. The commission should only conduct a preliminary investigation\".{{clarify|date=November 2011}} The commission should also observe the press and counterrevolutionary parties, sabotaging officials and other criminals. \n\n[[File:Sankt Petersburg-Regierungssitz Smolny.jpg|thumb|left|[[Smolny Institute|Smolny]], the seat of the Soviet government, 1917]]\n\nThree sections were created: informational, organizational, and a unit to combat counter-revolution and sabotage. Upon the end of the meeting, Dzerzhinsky reported to the [[Sovnarkom]] with the requested information. The commission was allowed to apply such measures of repression as 'confiscation, deprivation of ration cards, publication of lists of enemies of the people etc.'\".<ref name=\"Mozokhin\" /> That day, Sovnarkom officially confirmed the creation of VCheKa. The commission was created not under the VTsIK as was previously anticipated, but rather under the Council of the People's Commissars.<ref name=\"People's Commissars\">{{cite web|url=http://memory.irk.ru/zp1.htm |title=Partial protocol of the 21st session of the Council of the People's Commissars |publisher=Memory.irk.ru |date=1998-12-26 |accessdate=2011-07-27}}</ref>\n\nOn December 8, 1917, some of the original members of the VCheka were replaced. Averin, Ordzhonikidze, and Trifonov were replaced by V. V. Fomin, S. E. Shchukin, Ilyin, and Chernov.<ref name=\"People's Commissars\" /> On the meeting of December 8, the presidium of VChK was elected of five members, and chaired by Dzerzhinsky. The issue of \"[[speculation]]\" {{ambiguous|date=November 2011}} was raised at the same meeting, which was assigned to Peters to address and report with results to one of the next meetings of the commission.  A circular, published on {{OldStyleDate|December 28|1917|December 15}}, gave the address of VCheka's first headquarters as \"Petrograd, Gorokhovaya 2, 4th floor\".<ref name=\"People's Commissars\" /> On December 11, Fomin was ordered to organize a section to suppress \"speculation.\"  And in the same day, VCheKa offered Shchukin to conduct arrests of counterfeiters.\n\nIn January 1918, a subsection of the anti-counterrevolutionary effort was created to police bank officials.  The structure of VCheKa was changing repeatedly.  By March 1918, when the organization came to Moscow, it contained the following sections: against counterrevolution, speculation, non-residents, and information gathering. By the end of 1918\u20131919, some new units were created: secretly operative, investigatory, of transportation, military (special), operative, and instructional.  By 1921, it changed once again, forming the following sections: directory of affairs, administrative-organizational, secretly operative, economical, and foreign affairs.\n\n=== First months ===\n[[File:Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich 1919.jpg|thumb|upright=0.70|Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich]]\n\nIn the first months of its existence, VCheKa consisted of only 40 officials. It commanded a team of soldiers, the Sveaborgesky regiment, as well as a group of Red Guardsmen. On January 14, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered Dzerzhinsky to organize teams of \"energetic and ideological\" sailors to combat speculation. By the spring of 1918, the commission had several teams: in addition to the Sveaborge team, it had an intelligence team, a team of sailors, and a strike team. Through the winter of 1917\u20131918, all activities of VCheKa were centralized mainly in the city of Petrograd. It was one of several other commissions in the country which fought against counterrevolution, speculation, banditry, and other activities perceived as crimes. Other organizations included: the Bureau of Military Commissars, and an Army-Navy investigatory commission to attack the counterrevolutionary element in the [[Red Army]], plus the Central Requisite and Unloading Commission to fight speculation. The investigation of counterrevolutionary or major criminal offenses was conducted by the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal. The functions of VCheKa were closely intertwined with the Commission of [[Vladimir Bonch-Bruyevich|V. D. Bonch-Bruyevich]], which beside the fight against wine [[pogrom]]s was engaged in the investigation of most major political offenses (see: [[Bonch-Bruyevich Commission]]).\n\n[[File:Petrovskiy Grigoriy.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Grigory Petrovsky]]\n\nAll results of its activities, VCheKa had either to transfer to the Investigatory Commission of Revtribunal, or to dismiss. The control of the commission's activity was provided by the [[Ministry of Justice (Soviet Union)|People's Commissariat for Justice]] (Narkomjust, at that time headed by Isidor Steinberg) and Internal Affairs (NKVD, at that time headed by [[Hryhoriy Petrovsky]]). Although the VCheKa was officially an independent organization from the [[NKVD]], its chief members such as Dzerzhinsky, [[Martin Latsis|Latsis]], [[J\u00f3zef Unszlicht|Unszlicht]], and [[Moisei Uritsky|Uritsky]] (all main chekists), since November 1917 composed the collegiate of NKVD headed by Petrovsky. In November 1918, Petrovsky was appointed as head of the All-Ukrainian Central [[Military Revolutionary Committee]] during VCheKa's expansion to provinces and front-lines. At the time of political competition between Bolsheviks and SRs (January 1918), [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left SRs]] attempted to curb the rights of VCheKa and establish through the [[Ministry of Justice (Soviet Union)|Narkomiust]] their control over its work. Having failed in attempts to subordinate the VCheKa to Narkomiust, the Left SRs tried to gain control of the Extraordinary Commission in a different way: they requested that the Central Committee of the party was granted the right to directly enter their representatives into the VCheKa. [[Sovnarkom]] recognized the desirability of including five representatives of the Left Socialist-Revolutionary faction of VTsIK. Left SRs were granted the post of a companion (deputy) chairman of VCheKa. However, Sovnarkom, in which the majority belonged to the representatives of RSDLP(b) retained the right to approve members of the collegium of the VCheKa.\n\nOriginally, members of the Cheka were exclusively [[Bolshevik]]; however, in January 1918, [[Left Socialist-Revolutionaries|Left SRs]] also joined the organization<ref>Schapiro (1984).</ref> The Left SRs were expelled or arrested later in 1918, following the attempted assassination of Lenin by an SR, [[Fanni Kaplan]].\n\n=== Consolidation of VCheKa and National Establishment ===\nBy the end of January 1918, the Investigatory Commission of [[Petrograd Soviet]] (probably same as of Revtribunal) petitioned [[Sovnarkom]] to delineate the role of detection and judicial-investigatory organs. It offered to leave, for the VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich, only the functions of detection and suppression, while investigative functions entirely transferred to it.  The Investigatory Commission prevailed.  On January 31, 1918, Sovnarkom ordered to relieve VCheKa of the investigative functions, leaving for the commission only the functions of detection, suppression, and prevention of anti revolutionary crimes.  At the meeting of the Council of People's Commissars on January 31, 1918, a merger of VCheKa and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich was proposed.  The existence of both commissions, VCheKa of Sovnarkom and the Commission of Bonch-Bruyevich of VTsIK, with almost the same functions and equal rights, became impractical.  A decision followed two weeks later.<ref>''[[Izvestiya]]''. February 28, 1918.</ref>\n\nOn February 23, 1918, VCheKa sent a radio telegram to all Soviets with a petition to immediately organize emergency commissions to combat counter-revolution, sabotage and speculation, if such commissions had not been yet organized.  February 1918 saw the creation of local Extraordinary Commissions.  One of the first founded was the [[Moscow]] Cheka.  Sections and commissariats to combat counterrevolution were established in other cities.  The Extraordinary Commissions arose, usually in the areas during the moments of the greatest aggravation of political situation.  On February 25, 1918, as the counterrevolutionary organization ''Union of Front-liners'' was making advances, the executive committee of the [[Saratov]] Soviet formed a counter-revolutionary section.  On March 7, 1918, because of the move from [[Petrograd]] to Moscow, the Petrograd Cheka was created.  On March 9, a section for combating counterrevolution was created under the [[Omsk]] Soviet.  Extraordinary commissions were also created in [[Penza]], [[Perm]], [[Novgorod]], [[Cherepovets]], [[Rostov]], [[Taganrog]].  On March 18, VCheKa adopted a resolution, ''The Work of VCheKa on the All-Russian Scale'', foreseeing the formation everywhere of Extraordinary Commissions after the same model, and sent a letter that called for the widespread establishment of the Cheka in combating counterrevolution, speculation, and sabotage.  Establishment of provincial Extraordinary Commissions was largely completed by August 1918.  In the Soviet Republic, there were 38 [[guberniya|gubernatorial]] Chekas (Gubcheks) by this time.\n\nOn June 12, 1918, the All-Russian Conference of Cheka adopted the ''Basic Provisions on the Organization of Extraordinary Commissions''. They set out to form Extraordinary Commissions not only at [[Oblast]] and [[Guberniya]] levels, but also at the large [[Uyezd]] Soviets. In August 1918, in the Soviet Republic had accounted for some 75 Uyezd-level Extraordinary Commissions.  By the end of the year, 365 Uyezd-level Chekas were established.  In 1918, the All-Russia Extraordinary Commission and the Soviets managed to establish a local Cheka apparatus.  It included Oblast, Guberniya, [[Raion]], [[Uyezd]], and [[Volost]] Chekas, with Raion and Volost Extraordinary Commissioners. In addition, border security Chekas were included in the system of local Cheka bodies.\n\nIn the autumn of 1918, as consolidation of the political situation of the republic continued, a move toward elimination of Uyezd-, Raion-, and Volost-level Chekas, as well as the institution of Extraordinary Commissions was considered. On January 20, 1919, VTsIK adopted a resolution prepared by VCheKa, ''On the abolition of Uyezd Extraordinary Commissions''. On January 16 the presidium of VCheKa approved the draft on the establishment of the Politburo at Uyezd [[militsiya]]. This decision was approved by the Conference of the Extraordinary Commission IV, held in early February 1920.\n\n=== Other types of Cheka ===\n[[File:1988 CPA 6011.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of [[Martin Latsis (Lacis)|Martin Latsis]] on a Soviet [[postage stamp]].]]\n\nOn August 3, a VCheKa section for combating counterrevolution, speculation and sabotage on railways was created. On August 7, 1918, [[Sovnarkom]] adopted a decree on the organization of the railway section at VCheKa. Combating counterrevolution, speculation, and [[malfeasance]] on railroads was passed under the jurisdiction of the railway section of VCheKa and local Cheka. In August 1918, railway sections were formed under the Gubcheks. Formally, they were part of the non-resident sections, but in fact constituted a separate division, largely autonomous in their activities. The gubernatorial and oblast-type Chekas retained in relationship to the transportation sections only control and investigative functions.\n\nThe beginning of a systematic work of organs of VCheKa in [[RKKA]] refers to July 1918, the period of extreme tension of the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and class struggle in the country. On July 16, 1918, the Council of People's Commissars formed the Extraordinary Commission for combating counterrevolution at the Czechoslovak (Eastern) Front, led by [[Martin Latsis|M. I. Latsis]]. In the fall of 1918, Extraordinary Commissions to combat counterrevolution on the Southern (Ukraine) Front were formed. In late November, the Second All-Russian Conference of the Extraordinary Commissions accepted a decision after a report from [[I. N. Polukarov]] to establish at all frontlines, and army sections of the Cheka and granted them the right to appoint their commissioners in military units.  On December 9, 1918, the collegiate (or presidium) of VCheKa had decided to form a military section, headed by [[Mikhail Sergeevich Kedrov|M. S. Kedrov]], to combat counterrevolution in the Army.  In early 1919, the military control and the military section of VCheKa were merged into one body, the [[Special Section of the Republic]].  [[Mikhail Sergeevich Kedrov|Kedrov]] was appointed as head.  On January 1, he issued an order to establish the Special Section. The order instructed agencies everywhere to unite the Military control and the military sections of Chekas and to form special sections of frontlines, armies, military districts, and [[guberniya]]s.\n\nIn November 1920 the [[Soviet of Labor and Defense]] created a Special Section of VCheKa for the security of the state border.  On February 6, 1922, after the Ninth All-Russian Soviet Congress, the Cheka was dissolved by VTsIK, \"with expressions of gratitude for heroic work.\"  It was replaced by the [[State Political Administration]] or OGPU, a section of the [[NKVD]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR).  Dzerzhinsky remained as chief of the new organization.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Operations ==\n=== Suppression of political opposition ===\n{{See also|Red Terror}}\n\nInitially formed to fight against counter-revolutionaries and saboteurs, as well as [[Speculation|financial speculators]], the Cheka had its own classifications. Those counter-revolutionaries fell under these categories:\n\n# any civil or military servicemen suspected of working for Imperial Russia;\n# families of officers-volunteers (including children);{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n# all clergy;\n# workers and peasants who were under suspicion of not supporting the Soviet government;{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n# any other person whose private property was valued at over 10,000 rubles.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nAs its name implied, the Extraordinary Commission had virtually unlimited powers and could interpret them in any way it wished.  No standard procedures were ever set up, except that the Commission was supposed to send the arrested to the Military-Revolutionary tribunals if outside of a war zone. This left an opportunity for a wide range of interpretations, as the whole country was in total chaos. At the direction of Lenin, the Cheka performed mass arrests, imprisonments, and executions of \"[[enemies of the people]]\". In this, the Cheka said that they targeted \"class enemies\" such as the [[bourgeoisie]], and members of the [[clergy]]; the first organized mass repression began against the [[Libertarianism|libertarians]] and socialists of Petrograd in April 1918. Over the next few months, 800 were arrested and shot without trial.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nWithin a month, the Cheka had extended its repression to all political opponents of the communist government, including [[Anarchism|anarchists]] and others on the left.  On April 11/12, 1918, some 26 anarchist political centres in Moscow were attacked. Forty anarchists were killed by Cheka forces, and about 500 were arrested and jailed after a pitched battle took place between the two groups.<ref>P. Avrich. G. Maximoff</ref> In response to the anarchists' resistance, the Cheka orchestrated a massive retaliatory campaign of repression, executions, and arrests against all opponents of the Bolshevik government, in what came to be known as \"[[Red Terror]]\".  The ''Red Terror'', implemented by Dzerzhinsky on September 5, 1918, was vividly described by the [[Red Army]] journal ''Krasnaya Gazeta'':\n\n<blockquote>Without mercy, without sparing, we will kill our enemies in scores of hundreds. Let them be thousands, let them drown themselves in their own blood. For the blood of Lenin and [[Moisei Uritsky|Uritsky]] \u2026 let there be floods of blood of the [[bourgeoisie]] \u2013 more blood, as much as possible...\"<ref>Applebaum (2003), page 9.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn early Bolshevik, [[Victor Serge]] described in his book ''Memoirs of a Revolutionary'':\n\n{{quote|Since the first massacres of Red prisoners by the Whites, the murders of Volodarsky and Uritsky and the attempt against Lenin (in the summer of 1918), the custom of arresting and, often, executing hostages had become generalized and legal. Already the Cheka, which made mass arrests of suspects, was tending to settle their fate independently, under formal control of the Party, but in reality without anybody's knowledge. The Party endeavoured to head it with incorruptible men like the former convict Dzerzhinsky, a sincere idealist, ruthless but chivalrous, with the emaciated profile of an [[Inquisitor]]: tall forehead, bony nose, untidy goatee, and an expression of weariness and austerity. But the Party had few men of this stamp and many Chekas. I believe that the formation of the Chekas was one of the gravest and most impermissible errors that the Bolshevik leaders committed in 1918 when plots, blockades, and interventions made them lose their heads. All evidence indicates that [[revolutionary tribunal (Russia)|revolutionary tribunals]], functioning in the light of day and admitting the right of defense, would have attained the same efficiency with far less abuse and depravity. Was it necessary to revert to the procedures of the Inquisition?\"}}\n\nThe Cheka was also used against the armed anarchist [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] of [[Nestor Makhno]] in the Ukraine.  After the Black Army had served its purpose in aiding the [[Red Army]] to stop the [[White Army|Whites]] under [[Anton Denikin|Denikin]], the Soviet communist government decided to eliminate the anarchist forces. In May 1919, two Cheka agents sent to assassinate Makhno were caught and executed.<ref>Avrich, Paul, \"Russian Anarchists and the Civil War\", ''Russian Review'', Volume 27, Issue 3 (July 1968), pp. 296\u2013306.</ref>\n\nMany victims of Cheka repression were \"bourgeois hostages\" rounded up and held in readiness for [[summary execution]] in reprisal for any alleged counter-revolutionary act. Wholesale, indiscriminate arrests became an integral part of the system.<ref>Figes (1996), page 643.</ref> The Cheka used trucks disguised as delivery trucks, called \"Black Marias\", for the secret arrest and transport of prisoners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gulaghistory.org/items/show/186|title=Prisoners Exiting a Black Maria|first=|last=Unknown|date=17 December 2016|publisher=|via=Gulag: Many Days, Many Lives}}</ref>\n\nIt was during the [[Red Terror]] that the Cheka, hoping to avoid the bloody aftermath of having half-dead victims writhing on the floor, developed a technique for execution known later by the German words \"''Nackenschuss''{{-\"}} or \"''Genickschuss''{{-\"}}, a shot to the [[nape]] of the neck, which caused minimal blood loss and instant death. The victim's head was bent forward, and the executioner fired slightly downward at point blank range. This had become the standard method used later by the [[NKVD]] to liquidate [[Joseph Stalin]]'s [[Great Purge|purge]] victims and others.<ref>Paul, Allen.

Naval Institute Press, 1996. {{ISBN|1-55750-670-1}}. pp. 111/112.</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of deserters ===\nIt is believed that there were more than three million [[deserter]]s from the Red Army in 1919 and 1920. Approximately 500,000 deserters were arrested in 1919 and close to 800,000 in 1920, by troops of the 'Special Punitive Department' of the Cheka, created to punish desertions.<ref name=\"Black\" /><ref>Chamberlain, William Henry, ''The Russian Revolution: 1917\u20131921'', New York: Macmillan Co. (1957), p. 131</ref> These troops were used to forcibly [[Repatriation|repatriate]] deserters, taking and shooting hostages to force compliance or to set an example. Throughout the course of the civil war, several thousand deserters were shot \u2013 a number comparable to that of belligerents during [[World War I]].\n\nIn September 1918, according to ''[[The Black Book of Communism]]'', in only twelve provinces of Russia, 48,735 deserters and 7,325 \"bandits\" were arrested, 1,826 were killed and 2,230 were executed.  The exact identity of these individuals is confused by the fact that the Soviet Bolshevik government used the term 'bandit' to cover ordinary criminals as well as armed and unarmed political opponents, such as the anarchists.\n\n== Repression ==\n{{Repression in the Soviet Union}}\n\n=== Number of victims ===\nEstimates on Cheka executions vary widely. The lowest figures (''disputed below'') are provided by Dzerzhinsky's lieutenant [[Martin Latsis|Martyn Latsis]], limited to RSFSR over the period 1918\u20131920:\n\n*For the period 1918 \u2013 July 1919, covering only twenty provinces of central Russia:\n::In 1918: 6,300; in 1919 (up to July): 2,089; Total: 8,389\n\n*For the whole period 1918\u201319:\n::In 1918: 6,185; in 1919: 3,456; Total: 9,641\n\n*For the whole period 1918\u201320:\n::In January\u2013June 1918: 22; in July\u2013December 1918: more than 6,000; in 1918\u201320: 12,733.\n\nExperts generally agree these semi-official figures are vastly understated.<ref>pages 463\u2013464, Leggett (1986).</ref> Pioneering historian of the [[Red Terror]] [[Sergei Melgunov]] claims that this was done deliberately in an attempt to demonstrate the government's humanity.

Chekists reportedly poured water on naked prisoners in the winter-bound streets until they became living ice statues. Others reportedly beheaded their victims by twisting their necks until their heads could be torn off. The [[Chinese in Russian Revolution|Cheka detachments]] stationed in [[Kiev]] reportedly would attach an iron tube to the torso of a bound victim and insert a rat in the tube closed off with wire netting, while the tube was held over a flame until the rat began gnawing through the victim's guts in an effort to escape.<ref name=Linc /> [[Anton Denikin]]'s investigation discovered corpses whose lungs, throats, and mouths had been packed with earth.<ref name=\"Linc\" /><ref>pages 177\u2013179, Melg(o)unov (1925).</ref>\n\nWomen and children were also victims of Cheka terror.

A First Dictionary of Linguistics and Phonetics. Boulder, CO: Westview, 1980. Print.</ref> A clitic is pronounced like an [[affix]], but plays a syntactic role at the [[phrase]] level.  In other words, clitics have the ''form'' of affixes, but the distribution of [[function word]]s. For example, the contracted forms of the auxiliary verbs in ''I'm'' and ''we've'' are clitics.\n\nClitics can belong to any grammatical category, although they are commonly [[pronoun]]s, [[determiner]]s, or [[adposition]]s. Note that [[orthography]] is not always a good guide for distinguishing clitics from affixes: clitics may be written as separate words, but sometimes they are joined to the word they depend on (like the Latin clitic ''-que'', meaning \"and\"), or separated by special characters such as [[hyphen]]s or [[apostrophe]]s (like the English clitic ''\u2019s'' in \"it's\" for \"it has\" or \"it is\").\n\n==Classification==\n{{confusing|section|reason=it is unclear which words or parts of words are clitics in the examples|date=July 2014}}\n\nClitics fall into various categories depending on their position in relation to the word they connect to.<ref name=\"crystal\" />\n\n=== Proclitic ===\n\nA proclitic appears before its host.<ref name=\"crystal\" /> It is common in Romance languages. For example, in French, there is \"il '''s''''est r\u00e9veill\u00e9\" (\"he woke up\"), or \"je '''t''''aime\" (\"I love you\").\n\n=== Enclitic ===\n\nAn enclitic appears after its host.<ref name=\"crystal\" />\n*[[Latin]]: [[SPQR|Senatus ''Populus'''''que''' Romanus]]\n::\"Senate ''people''-'''and''' Roman\" = \"The Senate and people of Rome\"\n*[[Ancient Greek]]: ''\u00e1nthr\u014dpo\u00ed'' ('''te''') ''theo\u00ed'' '''te'''\n:::\"''people'' ('''and''') ''gods'' '''and'''\" = \"(both) men and gods\"\n*[[Sanskrit]]: ''naro gaja\u015b'' '''ca''' = \u0928\u0930\u0903 \u0917\u091c\u0903 \u091a > with [[sandhi]], \u0928\u0930\u094b \u0917\u091c\u0936\u094d\u091a \n:::\"''the man the elephant '''and'''\" = \"the man and the elephant\"\n*Sanskrit: [[Namaste|Namas'''te''']] < ''nama\u1e25'' + ''te'', ([[Devanagari]]: \u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d + \u0924\u0947 = \u0928\u092e\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0947), with sandhi change ''nama\u1e25'' > ''namas''.\n::: \"''bowing to you''\"\n*[[Czech language|Czech]]: ''chce\u0161-'''li'''''\n::\"''(you) want''-'''if'''\" = \"if you want\"\n*[[Telugu language|Telugu]]: ''idi n\u0101 puvvu'' = \u0c07\u0c26\u0c3f \u0c28\u0c3e \u0c2a\u0c41\u0c35\u0c4d\u0c35\u0c41 (This is my flower).

For example, in Portuguese, ''conquistar-'''se'''-\u00e1'' (\"it will be conquered\"), ''d\u00e1-'''lo'''-ei'' (\"I will give it\"), ''mat\u00e1-'''la'''-ia'' (\"he/she/it would kill her\"). These are found much more often in writing than in speech. It is even possible to use two pronouns inside the verb, as in ''dar-'''no'''-'''lo'''-\u00e1'' (\"he/she/it will give it to us\"), or ''dar-'''ta'''-ei'' (''ta'' = ''te'' + ''a'', \"I will give it/her to you\"). As in other Romance languages, the Portuguese synthetic future tense comes from the merging of the infinitive and the corresponding finite forms of the verb ''haver'' (from Latin ''hab\u0113re''), which explains the possibility of separating it from the infinitive.\n\n=== Endoclitic ===\n\nThe endoclitic splits apart the root and is inserted between the two pieces. Endoclitics defy the [[Lexical Integrity Hypothesis]] (or Lexicalist hypothesis) and so were long thought impossible.

New York: Garland, 1992. N. pag. Print.</ref> This distinction is, however, disputed.<ref>Berm\u00fadez-Otero, Ricardo & John Payne (2011). There are no special clitics. In Alexandra Galani, Glyn Hicks & George Tsoulas (eds), ''Morphology and its interfaces'' (Linguistik Aktuell 178), 57\u201396. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.</ref>\n\n=== Simple clitics ===\n\nSimple clitics are free morphemes, meaning they can stand alone in a phrase or sentence. They are unaccented and thus phonologically dependent upon a nearby word. They only derive meaning from this \"host\".<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n=== Special clitics ===\n\nSpecial clitics are morphemes that are bound to the word they are dependent upon, meaning they exist as a part of their host. This form, which is unaccented, represents a variant of a free form that does carry stress. While the two variants carry similar meaning and phonological makeup, the special clitic is bound to a host word and unaccented.<ref name=\"miller\" />\n\n==Properties==\nSome clitics can be understood as elements undergoing a historical process of [[grammaticalization]]:<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Hopper\n | first = Paul J.\n |author2=Elizabeth Closs Traugott\n | year = 2003\n | edition = 2nd\n | title = Grammaticalization\n | publisher = Cambridge University Press\n | location = Cambridge\n | isbn=978-0-521-80421-9}}\n</ref>\n\n{{in5}}lexical item \u2192 clitic \u2192 affix<ref name=\"klavans\">[[Judith Klavans|Klavans, Judith L.]] On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.</ref>\n\nAccording to this model from [[Judith Klavans]], an autonomous lexical item in a particular context loses the properties of a fully independent word over time and acquires the properties of a morphological affix (prefix, suffix, infix, etc.). At any intermediate stage of this evolutionary process, the element in question can be described as a \"clitic\". As a result, this term ends up being applied to a highly heterogeneous class of elements, presenting different combinations of word-like and affix-like properties.<ref name=\"klavans\" />\n\n===Prosody===\nOne characteristic shared by many clitics is a lack of [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosodic]] independence. A clitic attaches to an adjacent word, known as its ''host''. Orthographic conventions treat clitics in different ways: Some are written as separate words, some are written as one word with their hosts, and some are attached to their hosts, but set off by punctuation (a hyphen or an apostrophe, for example).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Comparison with affixes===\nAlthough the term \"clitic\" can be used descriptively to refer to any element whose grammatical status is somewhere in between a typical word and a typical affix, linguists have proposed various definitions of \"clitic\" as a technical term. One common approach is to treat clitics as words that are prosodically deficient: they cannot appear without a host, and they can only form an accentual unit in combination with their host. The term \"'''postlexical clitic'''\" is used for this narrower sense of the term.<ref>Klavans, Judith L. On Clitics and Cliticization: The Interaction of Morphology, Phonology, and Syntax. New York: Garland Pub., 1995. Print.</ref>\n\nGiven this basic definition, further criteria are needed to establish a dividing line between postlexical clitics and morphological affixes, since both are characterized by a lack of prosodic autonomy. There is no natural, clear-cut boundary between the two categories (since from a historical point of view, a given form can move gradually from one to the other by morphologization). However, by identifying clusters of observable properties that are associated with core examples of clitics on the one hand, and core examples of affixes on the other, one can pick out a battery of tests that provide an empirical foundation for a clitic/affix distinction.\n\nAn affix syntactically and [[phonology|phonologically]] attaches to a base [[morpheme]] of a limited [[part of speech]], such as a verb, to form a new word.  A clitic syntactically functions above the word level, on the [[phrase]] or [[clause]] level, and attaches only phonetically to the first, last, or only word in the phrase or clause, whichever part of speech the word belongs to.<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Zwicky\n | first = Arnold\n | authorlink = Arnold Zwicky\n | year = 1977\n | title = On Clitics\n | publisher = Indiana University Linguistics Club\n | location = Bloomington}}\n</ref>\nThe results of applying these criteria sometimes reveal that elements that have traditionally been called \"clitics\" actually have the status of affixes (e.g., the Romance pronominal clitics discussed [[#Romance languages|below]]).<ref name=Spencer/>\n\nZwicky and Pullum postulated five characteristics that distinguish clitics from affixes:<ref name=Spencer/>\n# Clitics do not select their hosts.  That is, they are \"promiscuous\", attaching to whichever word happens to be in the right place.  Affixes do select their host:  They only attach to the word they are connected to semantically, and generally attach to a particular part of speech.\n# Clitics do not exhibit arbitrary gaps.  Affixes, on the other hand, are often lexicalized and may simply not occur with certain words.  (English plural -s, for example, does not occur with \"child\".)\n# Clitics do not exhibit morphophonological idiosyncrasies.  That is, they follow the morphophonological rules of the rest of the language.  Affixes may be irregular in this regard.\n# Clitics do not exhibit semantic idiosyncrasies.  That is, the meaning of the phrase-plus-clitic is predictable from the meanings of the phrase and the clitic.  Affixes may have irregular meanings.\n# Clitics can attach to material already containing clitics (and affixes).  Affixes can attach to other affixes, but not to material containing clitics.\nAn example of differing analyses by different linguists is the discussion of the possessive ('s) in English, some linguists treating it as an affix, while others treat it as a special clitic.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Clitics: An Introduction | first1=Andrew |last1=Spencer| first2=Ana R. |last2=Luis |isbn=9781139560313 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=wLYgAwAAQBAJ |date= 2012 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |pages=292\u2013293|quote=There are two alternatives that have been explored in recent literature.}}</ref> \n\n===Comparison with words===\nSimilar to the discussion above, clitics must be distinguishable from words. Linguists have proposed a number of tests to differentiate between the two categories. Some tests, specifically, are based upon the understanding that when comparing the two, clitics resemble affixes, while words resemble syntactic phrases. Clitics and words resemble different categories, in the sense that they share certain properties. Six such tests are described below. These, of course, are not the only ways to differentiate between words and clitics.<ref name=\"zwicky\">Zwicky, Arnold M. \"Clitics and Particles.\" Language 61.2 (1985): 283-305. Print.</ref>\n\n#If a morpheme is bound to a word and can never occur in complete isolation, then it is likely a clitic. In contrast, a word is not bound and can appear on its own.\n#If the addition of a morpheme to a word prevents further affixation, then it is likely a clitic.\n#If a morpheme combines with single words to convey a further degree of meaning, then it is likely a clitic. A word combines with a group of words or phrases to denote further meaning.{{Contradiction inline|reason=Further above it is said that clitics work on the phrase level. The English possessive, for example, attaches to a complete phrase.|date=October 2014}}\n#If a morpheme must be in a certain order with respect to other morphemes within the construction, then it is likely a clitic. Independent words enjoy free ordering with respect to other words, within the confines of the word order of the language.\n#If a morpheme\u2019s allowable behavior is determined by one principle, it is likely a clitic. For example, \"a\" proceeds indefinite nouns in English. Words can rarely be described with one such description.\n#In general, words are more morphologically complex than clitics. Clitics are rarely composed of more than one morpheme.<ref name=\"zwicky\" />\n\n===Word order<!--'Wackernagel's Law' and 'Wackernagel's law' redirect here-->===\nClitics do not always appear next to the word or phrase that they are associated with grammatically. They may be subject to global word order constraints that act on the entire sentence. Many [[Indo-European languages]], for example, obey '''Wackernagel's law'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> (named after [[Jacob Wackernagel]]), which requires clitics to appear in \"second position\", after the first syntactic phrase or the first stressed word in a clause:<ref name=\"klavans\" />\n*[[Latin language|Latin]] had three enclitics that appeared in second or third position of a clause: ''enim'' 'indeed, for', ''autem'' 'but, moreover', ''vero'' 'however'.  For example, ''quis enim potest negare?'' (from [[Martial]]'s epigram LXIV, literally \"who indeed can deny [her riches]?\"). Spevak (2010) reports that in her corpus of [[Caesar]], [[Cicero]] and [[Sallust]], these three words appear in such position in 100% of the cases.<ref>Spevak, Olga (2010).

Production rules are simple replacements. For example, the rule\n\n<math>A\\ \\to\\ \\alpha</math>\n\nreplaces <math>A</math> with <math>\\alpha</math>. There can be multiple replacement rules for any given value. For example,\n\n<math>A\\ \\to\\ \\alpha</math>\n\n<math>A\\ \\to\\ \\beta</math>\n\nmeans that <math>A</math> can be replaced with either <math>\\alpha</math> or <math>\\beta</math>.\n\nIn context-free grammars, all rules are one-to-one, one-to-many, or one-to-none. These rules can be applied regardless of context. The left-hand side of the production rule is always a [[nonterminal]] symbol. This means that the symbol does not appear in the resulting formal language. So in our case, our language contains the letters <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> but not <math>A.</math><ref>Stephen Scheinberg, ''Note on the Boolean Properties of Context-Free Languages'', Information and Control, '''3''', 372\u2013375 (1960).</ref>\n\nRules can also be applied in reverse to check if a string is grammatically correct according to the grammar.\n\nHere is an example context-free grammar that describes all two-letter strings containing the letters <math>\\alpha</math> or <math>\\beta</math>.\n\n<math>S\\ \\to\\ AA</math>\n\n<math>A\\ \\to\\ \\alpha</math>\n\n<math>A\\ \\to\\ \\beta</math>\n\nIf we start with the nonterminal symbol <math>S</math> then we can use the rule\n<math>S\\ \\to\\ AA</math> to turn <math>S</math> into <math>AA</math>. We can then apply one of the two later rules. For example, if we apply <math>A\\ \\to\\ \\beta</math> to the first <math>A</math> we get <math>\\beta A</math>. If we then apply <math>A\\ \\to\\ \\alpha</math> to the second <math>A</math> we get <math>\\beta\\alpha</math>. Since both <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math> are terminal symbols, and in context-free grammars terminal symbols never appear on the left hand side of a production rule, there are no more rules that can be applied. This same process can be used, applying the last two rules in different orders in order to get all possible strings within our simple context-free grammar.\n\n[[formal language|Language]]s generated by context-free grammars are known as [[context-free language]]s (CFL). Different context-free grammars can generate the same context-free language. It is important to distinguish the properties of the language (intrinsic properties) from the properties of a particular grammar (extrinsic properties). The [[#Language equality|language equality]] question (do two given context-free grammars generate the same language?) is [[Decidability (logic)|undecidable]].\n\nContext-free grammars arise in [[linguistics]] where they are used to describe the structure of sentences and words in a [[natural language]], and they were in fact invented by the linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] for this purpose, but have not really lived up to their original expectation. By contrast, in [[computer science]], as the use of recursively-defined concepts increased, they were used more and more. In an early application, grammars are used to describe the structure of [[programming language]]s. In a newer application, they are used in an essential part of the [[Extensible Markup Language]] (XML) called the ''[[Document Type Definition]]''.<ref>''Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation'', John E. Hopcroft, Rajeev Motwani, Jeffrey D. Ullman, Addison Wesley, 2001, p.191</ref>\n\nIn [[linguistics]], some authors use the term '''[[phrase structure grammar]]''' to refer to context-free grammars, whereby phrase-structure grammars are distinct from [[dependency grammar]]s. In [[computer science]], a popular notation for context-free grammars is [[Backus\u2013Naur form]], or ''BNF''.\n\n== Background ==\n\nSince the time of [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]], at least, linguists have described the [[grammar]]s of languages in terms of their block structure, and described how sentences are [[recursion|recursively]] built up from smaller phrases, and eventually individual words or word elements. An essential property of these block structures is that logical units never overlap. For example, the sentence:\n: John, whose blue car was in the garage, walked to the grocery store.\ncan be logically parenthesized as follows:\n: (John, ((whose blue car) (was (in the garage))), (walked (to (the grocery store)))).\nA context-free grammar provides a simple and mathematically precise mechanism for describing the methods by which phrases in some natural language are built from smaller blocks, capturing the \"block structure\" of sentences in a natural way. Its simplicity makes the formalism amenable to rigorous mathematical study. Important features of natural language syntax such as [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]] are not part of the context-free grammar, but the basic recursive structure of sentences, the way in which clauses nest inside other clauses, and the way in which lists of adjectives and adverbs are swallowed by nouns and verbs, is described exactly.\n\nContext-free grammars are a special form of [[Semi-Thue system]]s that in their general form date back to the work of [[Axel Thue]].\n\nThe formalism of context-free grammars was developed in the mid-1950s by [[Noam Chomsky]],<ref name=\"hu106\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p.&nbsp;106.</ref> and also their [[Chomsky hierarchy|classification as a special type]] of [[formal grammar]] (which he called [[phrase-structure grammar]]s).<ref name=\"chomsky1956\">{{citation\n | last = Chomsky | first = Noam | authorlink =\n | title = Three models for the description of language\n | journal = Information Theory, IEEE Transactions\n | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 113\u2013124\n | publisher = | date = Sep 1956\n | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/18/22738/01056813.pdf?isnumber=22738&prod=STD&arnumber=1056813&arnumber=1056813&arSt=+113&ared=+124&arAuthor=+Chomsky%2C+N.\n | archiveurl = https://chomsky.info/wp-content/uploads/195609-.pdf\n | archivedate = 2013-10-18\n | doi = 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056813| id = | accessdate = 2007-06-18}}</ref> What Chomsky called a phrase structure grammar is also known now as a constituency grammar, whereby constituency grammars stand in contrast to [[dependency grammar]]s. In Chomsky's [[generative grammar]] framework, the syntax of natural language was described by context-free rules combined with transformation rules.\n\nBlock structure was introduced into computer [[programming language]]s by the [[Algol (programming language)|Algol]] project (1957\u20131960), which, as a consequence, also featured a context-free grammar to describe the resulting Algol syntax. This became a standard feature of computer languages, and the notation for grammars used in concrete descriptions of computer languages came to be known as [[Backus\u2013Naur form]], after two members of the Algol language design committee.<ref name=\"hu106\"/> The \"block structure\" aspect that context-free grammars capture is so fundamental to grammar that the terms syntax and grammar are often identified with context-free grammar rules, especially in computer science. Formal constraints not captured by the grammar are then considered to be part of the \"semantics\" of the language.\n\nContext-free grammars are simple enough to allow the construction of efficient [[list of algorithms#Parsing|parsing algorithm]]s that, for a given string, determine whether and how it can be generated from the grammar. An [[Earley parser]] is an example of such an algorithm, while the widely used [[LR parser|LR]] and [[LL parser]]s are simpler algorithms that deal only with more restrictive subsets of context-free grammars.\n\n== Formal definitions ==\nA context-free grammar {{mvar|G}} is defined by the 4-[[tuple]]:<ref>The notation here is that of {{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, p.&nbsp;94. {{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}} (p.&nbsp;79) define context-free grammars as 4-tuples in the same way, but with different variable names.</ref>\n\n<math>G = (V, \\Sigma, R, S)</math>\nwhere\n# {{mvar|V}} is a finite set; each element <math> v\\in V</math> is called ''a nonterminal character'' or a ''variable''. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by {{mvar|G}}.\n# {{math|\u03a3}} is a finite set of ''terminal''s, disjoint from {{mvar|V}}, which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar {{mvar|G}}.\n# {{mvar|R}} is a finite relation from {{mvar|V}} to <math>(V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math>, where the asterisk represents the [[Kleene star]] operation. The members of {{mvar|R}} are called the ''(rewrite) rule''s or ''production''s of the grammar. (also commonly symbolized by a {{mvar|P}})\n# {{mvar|S}} is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of {{mvar|V}}.\n\n=== Production rule notation ===\nA [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production rule]] in {{mvar|R}} is formalized mathematically as a pair <math>(\\alpha, \\beta)\\in R</math>, where <math>\\alpha \\in V</math> is a nonterminal and <math>\\beta \\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> is a [[string (computer science)|string]] of variables and/or terminals; rather than using [[ordered pair]] notation, production rules are usually written using an arrow operator with {{mvar|\u03b1}} as its left hand side and {{mvar|\u03b2}} as its right hand side:\n<math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta</math>.\n\nIt is allowed for {{mvar|\u03b2}} to be the [[empty string]], and in this case it is customary to denote it by \u03b5. The form <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\varepsilon</math> is called an {{mvar|\u03b5}}-production.<ref>{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, pp. 90\u201392.</ref>\n\nIt is common to list all right-hand sides for the same left-hand side on the same line, using | (the [[pipe symbol]]) to separate them. Rules <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow \\beta_1</math> and <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta_2</math> can hence be written as <math>\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta_1\\mid\\beta_2</math>. In this case, <math>\\beta_1</math> and <math>\\beta_2</math> is called the first and second alternative, respectively.\n\n=== Rule application ===\nFor any strings <math>u, v\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math>, we say {{mvar|u}} directly yields {{mvar|v}}, written as <math>u\\Rightarrow v\\,</math>, if <math>\\exists (\\alpha, \\beta)\\in R</math> with <math>\\alpha \\in V</math> and <math>u_{1}, u_{2}\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> such that <math>u\\,=u_{1}\\alpha u_{2}</math> and <math>v\\,=u_{1}\\beta u_{2}</math>. Thus, {{mvar|v}} is a result of applying the rule <math>(\\alpha, \\beta)</math> to {{mvar|u}}.\n\n=== Repetitive rule application ===\nFor any strings <math>u, v\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}, </math> we say {{mvar|u}} '''yields''' {{mvar|v}}, written as <math>u\\stackrel{*}{\\Rightarrow} v</math> (or <math>u\\Rightarrow\\Rightarrow v\\,</math> in some textbooks), if <math>\\exists k\\geq 1\\, \\exists \\, u_{1}, \\cdots, u_{k}\\in (V\\cup\\Sigma)^{*}</math> such that <math>u = \\, u_{1} \\Rightarrow u_{2} \\Rightarrow \\cdots \\Rightarrow u_{k} \\, = v</math>. In this case, if <math>k\\geq 2</math> (i.e., <math>u \\neq v</math>), the relation <math>u\\stackrel{+}{\\Rightarrow} v</math> holds.

A typical derivation in this grammar is\n:{{math|''S'' \u2192 ''aSa'' \u2192 ''aaSaa'' \u2192 ''aabSbaa'' \u2192 ''aabbaa''}}.\nThis makes it clear that \n<math>L(G) = \\{ww^R:w\\in\\{a,b\\}^*\\}</math>. \nThe language is context-free, however, it can be proved that it is not [[Regular language|regular]].\n\n=== Well-formed parentheses ===\nThe canonical example of a context-free grammar is parenthesis matching, which is representative of the general case. There are two terminal symbols \"(\" and \")\" and one nonterminal symbol S. The production rules are\n\n:S \u2192 SS\n:S \u2192 (S)\n:S \u2192 ()\n\nThe first rule allows the S symbol to multiply; the second rule allows the S symbol to become enclosed by matching parentheses; and the third rule terminates the recursion.\n\n=== Well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets ===\n\nA second canonical example is two different kinds of matching nested parentheses, described by the productions:\n\n:S \u2192 SS\n:S \u2192 ()\n:S \u2192 (S)\n:S \u2192 []\n:S \u2192 [S]\n\nwith terminal symbols [ ] ( ) and nonterminal S.\n\nThe following sequence can be derived in that grammar:\n: ([ [ [ ()() [ ][ ] ] ]([ ]) ])\n\n\n=== Matching pairs ===\nIn a context-free grammar, we can pair up characters the way we do with [[bracket]]s. The simplest example:\n\n:S \u2192 aSb\n:S \u2192 ab\n\nThis grammar generates the language <math> \\{ a^n b^n : n \\ge 1 \\} </math>, which is not [[regular language|regular]] (according to the [[pumping lemma for regular languages]]).\n\nThe special character \u03b5 stands for the empty string. By changing the above grammar to\n:S \u2192 aSb | \u03b5\nwe obtain a grammar generating the language <math> \\{ a^n b^n : n \\ge 0 \\} </math> instead. This differs only in that it contains the empty string while the original grammar did not.\n\n\n=== Distinct number of a's and b's ===\n\nA context-free grammar for the language consisting of all strings over {a,b} containing an unequal number of a's and b's:\n:S \u2192 U | V\n:U \u2192 TaU | TaT | UaT\n:V \u2192 TbV | TbT | VbT\n:T \u2192 aTbT | bTaT | \u03b5 \nHere, the nonterminal T can generate all strings with the same number of a's as b's, the nonterminal U generates all strings with more a's than b's and the nonterminal V generates all strings with fewer a's than b's. Omitting the third alternative in the rule for U and V doesn't restrict the grammar's language.\n\n=== Second block of b's of double size ===\n\nAnother example of a non-regular language is <math> \\{ b^n a^m b^{2n} : n \\ge 0, m \\ge 0 \\} </math>. It is context-free as it can be generated by the following context-free grammar:\n:S \u2192 bSbb | A\n:A \u2192 aA | \u03b5\n\n=== First-order logic formulas ===\n\nThe [[First-order logic#Formation rules|formation rules]] for the terms and formulas of formal logic fit the definition of context-free grammar, except that the set of symbols may be infinite and there may be more than one start symbol.\n\n\n== Examples of languages that are not context free ==\n\nIn contrast to well-formed nested parentheses and square brackets in the previous section, there is no context-free grammar for generating all sequences of two different types of parentheses, each separately balanced ''disregarding the other'', where the two types need not nest inside one another, for example:\n\n: [ ( ] )\n\nor\n\n: [ [ [ [(((( ] ] ] ]))))(([ ))(([ ))([ )( ])( ])( ])\n\nThe fact that this language is not context free can be proven using [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages]] and a proof by contradiction, observing that all words of the form \n<math>\n{(}^n {[}^n {)}^n {]}^n\n</math>\nshould belong to the language. This language belongs instead to a more general class and can be described by a [[conjunctive grammar]], which in turn also includes other non-context-free languages, such as the language of all words of the form\n<math>\na^n b^n c^n\n</math>.\n\n== Regular grammars ==\n\nEvery [[regular grammar]] is context-free, but not all context-free grammars are regular.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Aho |first1=Alfred Vaino |last2=Lam |first2=Monica S. |last3=Sethi |first3=Ravi |last4=Ullman |first4=Jeffrey David |authorlink1=Alfred Aho |authorlink2=Monica S.

For instance, the leftmost derivation\n\n S\n     \u2192 (rule 1 on the first S)\n  S+S\n     \u2192 (rule 2 on the first S)\n  1+S\n     \u2192 (rule 1 on the first S)\n  1+S+S\n     \u2192 (rule 2 on the first S)\n  1+1+S\n     \u2192 (rule 3 on the first S)\n  1+1+a\n\ncan be summarized as\n\n rule 1, rule 2, rule 1, rule 2, rule 3\n\nThe distinction between leftmost derivation and rightmost derivation is important because in most [[parsing|parser]]s the transformation of the input is defined by giving a piece of code for every grammar rule that is executed whenever the rule is applied. Therefore, it is important to know whether the parser determines a leftmost or a rightmost derivation because this determines the order in which the pieces of code will be executed. See for an example [[LL parser]]s and [[LR parser]]s.\n\nA derivation also imposes in some sense a hierarchical structure on the string that is derived. For example, if the string \"1 + 1 + a\" is derived according to the leftmost derivation:\n\n:S \u2192 S + S (1)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + S (2)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + S + S (1)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + 1 + S (2)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + 1 + a (3)\n\nthe structure of the string would be:\n\n: { { 1 }<sub>S</sub> + { { 1 }<sub>S</sub> + { a }<sub>S</sub> }<sub>S</sub> }<sub>S</sub>\nwhere { ... }<sub>S</sub> indicates a substring recognized as belonging to S. This hierarchy can also be seen as a tree:\n\n[[File:Simple Parse Tree 1.svg|x260px|Rightmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]\n\nThis tree is called a ''[[parse tree]]'' or \"concrete syntax tree\" of the string, by contrast with the [[abstract syntax tree]]. In this case the presented leftmost and the rightmost derivations define the same parse tree; however, there is another (rightmost) derivation of the same string\n\n:S \u2192 S + S (1)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 S + a (3)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 S + S + a (1)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 S + 1 + a (2)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + 1 + a (2)\n\nand this defines the following parse tree:\n\n[[File:Simple Parse Tree 2.svg|x260px|Leftmost derivation of `1 + 1 + a`]]\n\nNote however that both parse trees can be obtained by both leftmost and rightmost derivations.  For example, the last tree can be obtained with the leftmost derivation as follows:\n\n:S \u2192 S + S (1)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 S + S + S (1)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + S + S (2)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + 1 + S (2)\n:&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2192 1 + 1 + a (3)\n\nIf a string in the language of the grammar has more than one parsing tree, then the grammar is said to be an ''[[ambiguous grammar]]''. Such grammars are usually hard to parse because the parser cannot always decide which grammar rule it has to apply. Usually, ambiguity is a feature of the grammar, not the language, and an unambiguous grammar can be found that generates the same context-free language. However, there are certain languages that can only be generated by ambiguous grammars; such languages are called ''[[inherently ambiguous language]]s''.\n\n=== Example: Algebraic expressions ===\nHere is a context-free grammar for syntactically correct [[Infix notation|infix]] algebraic expressions in the variables x, y and z:\n# S \u2192 x\n# S \u2192 y\n# S \u2192 z\n# S \u2192 S + S\n# S \u2192 S - S\n# S \u2192 S * S\n# S \u2192 S / S\n# S \u2192 ( S )\n\nThis grammar can, for example, generate the string\n\n:( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )\n\nas follows:\n\n:S (the start symbol)\n: \u2192 S - S (by rule 5)\n: \u2192 S * S - S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)\n: \u2192 S * S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)\n: \u2192 ( S ) * S - S / S (by rule 8, applied to the leftmost S)\n: \u2192 ( S ) * S - S / ( S ) (by rule 8, applied to the rightmost S)\n: \u2192 ( S + S ) * S - S / ( S ) (etc.)\n: \u2192 ( S + S ) * S - S * S / ( S )\n: \u2192 ( S + S ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )\n: \u2192 ( x + S ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )\n: \u2192 ( x + y ) * S - S * S / ( S + S )\n: \u2192 ( x + y ) * x - S * y / ( S + S )\n: \u2192 ( x + y ) * x - S * y / ( x + S )\n: \u2192 ( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + S )\n: \u2192 ( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )\n\nNote that many choices were made underway as to which rewrite was going to be performed next.\nThese choices look quite arbitrary. As a matter of fact, they are, in the sense that the string finally generated is always the same.  For example, the second and third rewrites\n\n: \u2192 S * S - S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)\n: \u2192 S * S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)\n\ncould be done in the opposite order:\n\n: \u2192 S - S / S (by rule 7, applied to the rightmost S)\n: \u2192 S * S - S / S (by rule 6, applied to the leftmost S)\n\nAlso, many choices were made on which rule to apply to each selected <code>S</code>.\nChanging the choices made and not only the order they were made in usually affects which terminal string comes out at the end.\n\nLet's look at this in more detail.  Consider the [[parse tree]] of this derivation:\n\n[[File:Parse Tree 1.svg|An example parse tree]]\n\nStarting at the top, step by step, an S in the tree is expanded, until no more unexpanded <code>S</code>es (nonterminals) remain.\nPicking a different order of expansion will produce a different derivation, but the same parse tree.\nThe parse tree will only change if we pick a different rule to apply at some position in the tree.\n\nBut can a different parse tree still produce the same terminal string,\nwhich is <code>( x + y ) * x - z * y / ( x + x )</code> in this case?\nYes, for this particular grammar, this is possible.\nGrammars with this property are called [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]].\n\nFor example, <code>x + y * z</code> can be produced with these two different parse trees:\n\n[[File:Parse Tree Derivations.svg|x260px|Two different parse trees from the same input]]\n\nHowever, the ''language'' described by this grammar is not inherently ambiguous:\nan alternative, unambiguous grammar can be given for the language, for example:\n\n:T \u2192 x\n:T \u2192 y\n:T \u2192 z\n:S \u2192 S + T\n:S \u2192 S - T\n:S \u2192 S * T\n:S \u2192 S / T\n:T \u2192 ( S )\n:S \u2192 T\n\n(once again picking <code>S</code> as the start symbol). This alternative grammar will produce <code>x + y * z</code> with a parse tree similar to the left one above, i.e. implicitly assuming the association <code>(x + y) * z</code>, which is not according to standard operator precedence. More elaborate, unambiguous and context-free grammars can be constructed that produce parse trees that obey all desired [[Operator-precedence parser|operator precedence]] and associativity rules.\n\n\n== Normal forms ==\nEvery context-free grammar that does not generate the empty string can be transformed into one in which there is no \u03b5-production (that is, a rule that has the empty string as a product). If a grammar does generate the empty string, it will be necessary to include the rule <math>S \\rarr \\epsilon</math>, but there need be no other \u03b5-rule. Every context-free grammar with no \u03b5-production has an equivalent grammar in [[Chomsky normal form]], and a grammar in [[Greibach normal form]]. \"Equivalent\" here means that the two grammars generate the same language.\n\nThe especially simple form of production rules in Chomsky normal form grammars has both theoretical and practical implications. For instance, given a context-free grammar, one can use the Chomsky normal form to construct a [[polynomial-time]] algorithm that decides whether a given string is in the language represented by that grammar or not (the [[CYK algorithm]]).\n\n==Closure properties==\nContext-free languages are [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under the various operations, that is, if the languages ''K'' and ''L'' are \ncontext-free, so is the result of the following operations:\n\n* [[set union|union]] ''K'' \u222a ''L''; [[string concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] ''K'' \u2218 ''L''; [[Kleene star]] ''L''<sup>*</sup><ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), p.131, Theorem 6.1</ref>\n* [[string substitution|substitution]] (in particular [[string homomorphism|homomorphism]])<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.131\u2013132, Theorem 6.2</ref>\n* [[string homomorphism|inverse homomorphism]]<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.132\u2013134, Theorem 6.3</ref>\n* [[set intersection|intersection]] with a [[regular language]]<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.135\u2013136, Theorem 6.5</ref>\n\nThey are not closed under general intersection (hence neither under [[set complement|complementation]]) and set difference.<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.134\u2013135, Theorem 6.4</ref>\n\n== Decidable problems ==\n\nThe following are some decidable problems about context-free grammars.\n\n=== Parsing ===\n\nThe parsing problem, checking whether a given word belongs to the language given by a context-free grammar, is decidable, using one of the general-purpose parsing algorithms:\n* [[Chomsky normal form]] and the [[CYK algorithm]]\n* [[Earley parser]]\n* [[GLR parser]]\n\n=== Reachability, productiveness, nullability ===\n\nIt is decidable to check whether a given non-terminal of a context-free grammar is reachable, whether it is productive, and whether it is nullable (that is, it can derive an empty string).\n\n=== Regularity and LL(1) checks ===\n\nIt is decidable whether a given grammar is a [[regular grammar]], as well as whether it is an LL(1) grammar (see [[LL parser]]).\n\n=== Emptiness and finiteness ===\n\nThere are algorithms to decide whether a language of a given context-free language is empty, as well as whether it is finite.<ref>Hopcroft & Ullman (1979), pp.137\u2013138, Theorem 6.6</ref>.\n\n== Undecidable problems ==\nSome questions that are undecidable for wider classes of grammars become decidable for context-free grammars; e.g. the [[emptiness problem]] (whether the grammar generates any terminal strings at all), is undecidable for [[context-sensitive grammar]]s, but decidable for context-free grammars.\n\nHowever, many problems are [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]] even for context-free grammars. Examples are:\n\n=== Universality ===\nGiven a CFG, does it generate the language of all strings over the alphabet of terminal symbols used in its rules?<ref name=\"sipser\">{{harvtxt|Sipser|1997}}, Theorem 5.10, p. 181.</ref><ref name=\"hu281\"/>\n\nA reduction can be demonstrated to this problem from the well-known undecidable problem of determining whether a [[Turing machine]] accepts a particular input (the [[halting problem]]). The reduction uses the concept of a ''[[computation history]]'', a string describing an entire computation of a [[Turing machine]]. A CFG can be constructed that generates all strings that are not accepting computation histories for a particular Turing machine on a particular input, and thus it will accept all strings only if the machine doesn't accept that input.\n\n=== Language equality ===\nGiven two CFGs, do they generate the same language?<ref name=\"hu281\">{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979}}, p. 281.</ref><ref name=\"eom\"/>\n\nThe undecidability of this problem is a direct consequence of the previous: it is impossible to even decide whether a CFG is equivalent to the trivial CFG defining the language of all strings.\n\n=== Language inclusion ===\nGiven two CFGs, can the first one generate all strings that the second one can generate?<ref name=\"hu281\"/><ref name=\"eom\"/>\n\nIf this problem was decidable, then language equality could be decided too: two CFGs G1 and G2 generate the same language if L(G1) is a subset of L(G2) and L(G2) is a subset of L(G1).\n\n=== Being in a lower or higher level of the Chomsky hierarchy ===\nUsing [[Greibach's theorem]], it can be shown that the two following problems are undecidable:\n\n* Given a [[context-sensitive grammar]], does it describe a context-free language?\n* Given a context-free grammar, does it describe a [[regular language]]?<ref name=\"hu281\"/><ref name=\"eom\">{{citation|title=Encyclopaedia of mathematics: an updated and annotated translation of the Soviet \"Mathematical Encyclopaedia\"|first=Michiel|last=Hazewinkel|publisher=Springer|year=1994|isbn=978-1-55608-003-6|at=Vol. IV, p. 56|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s9F71NJxwzoC&pg=PA56}}.</ref>\n\n=== Grammar ambiguity ===\nGiven a CFG, is it [[Ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]]?\n\nThe undecidability of this problem follows from the fact that if an algorithm to determine ambiguity existed, the [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, which is known to be undecidable.\n\n=== Language disjointness ===\nGiven two CFGs, is there any string derivable from both grammars?\n\nIf this problem was decidable, the undecidable [[Post correspondence problem]] could be decided, too: given strings <math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_N, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_N</math> over some alphabet <math>\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_k\\}</math>, let the grammar {{tmath|G_1}} consist of the rule\n:<math>S \\to \\alpha_1 S \\beta_1^{rev} | \\cdots | \\alpha_N S \\beta_N^{rev} | b</math>;\nwhere <math>\\beta_i^{rev}</math> denotes the [[String (computer science)#Reversal|reversed]] string <math>\\beta_i</math> and <math>b</math> doesn't occur among the <math>a_i</math>; and let grammar {{tmath|G_2}} consist of  the rule\n:<math>T \\to a_1 T a_1 | \\cdots | a_k T a_k | b</math>;\nThen the Post problem given by <math>\\alpha_1, \\ldots, \\alpha_N, \\beta_1, \\ldots, \\beta_N</math> has a solution if and only if {{tmath|L(G_1)}} and {{tmath|L(G_2)}} share a derivable string.\n\n== Extensions ==\nAn obvious way to extend the context-free grammar formalism is to allow nonterminals to have arguments, the values of which are passed along within the rules. This allows natural language features such as [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] and [[reference]], and programming language analogs such as the correct use and definition of identifiers, to be expressed in a natural way. E.g. we can now easily express that in English sentences, the subject and verb must agree in number. In computer science, examples of this approach include [[affix grammar]]s, [[attribute grammar]]s, [[indexed grammar]]s, and Van Wijngaarden [[two-level grammar]]s. Similar extensions exist in linguistics.\n\nAn '''extended context-free grammar''' (or '''regular right part grammar''') is one in which the right-hand side of the production rules is allowed to be a [[regular expression]] over the grammar's terminals and nonterminals. Extended context-free grammars describe exactly the context-free languages.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/Courses/fm/pub/context-free.pdf | title=A Short Introduction to Regular Expressions and Context-Free Grammars | accessdate=August 24, 2012 | author=Norvell, Theodore | pages=4}}</ref>\n\nAnother extension is to allow additional terminal symbols to appear at the left-hand side of rules, constraining their application. This produces the formalism of [[context-sensitive grammar]]s.\n\n== Subclasses ==\nThere are a number of important subclasses of the context-free grammars:\n\n* [[LR parser|LR(''k'')]] grammars (also known as [[deterministic context-free grammar]]s) allow [[parsing]] (string recognition) with [[deterministic pushdown automaton|deterministic pushdown automata]] (PDA), but they can only describe [[deterministic context-free language]]s.\n* [[SLR grammar|Simple LR]], [[LALR parser|Look-Ahead LR]] grammars are subclasses that allow further simplification of parsing. SLR and LALR are recognized using the same PDA as LR, but with simpler tables, in most cases.\n* [[LL parser|LL(''k'') and LL(''*'')]] grammars allow parsing by direct construction of a leftmost derivation as described above, and describe even fewer languages.\n* [[Simple grammar]]s are a subclass of the LL(1) grammars mostly interesting for its theoretical property that language equality of simple grammars is decidable, while language inclusion is not.\n* [[Bracketed grammar]]s have the property that the terminal symbols are divided into left and right bracket pairs that always match up in rules.\n* [[Linear grammar]]s have no rules with more than one nonterminal on the right-hand side.\n* [[Regular grammar]]s are a subclass of the linear grammars and describe the [[regular language|regular]] languages, i.e. they correspond to [[finite automaton|finite automata]] and [[regular expression]]s.\n\nLR parsing extends LL parsing to support a larger range of grammars; in turn, [[GLR parser|generalized LR parsing]] extends LR parsing to support arbitrary context-free grammars.  On LL grammars and LR grammars, it essentially performs LL parsing and LR parsing, respectively, while on [[nondeterministic grammar]]s, it is as efficient as can be expected.  Although GLR parsing was developed in the 1980s, many new language definitions and [[parser generator]]s continue to be based on LL, LALR or LR parsing up to the present day.\n\n== Linguistic applications ==\n[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] initially hoped to overcome the limitations of context-free grammars by adding [[transformational grammar|transformation rules]].<ref name=\"chomsky1956\"/>\n\nSuch rules are another standard device in traditional linguistics; e.g. [[grammatical voice|passivization]] in English. Much of [[generative grammar]] has been devoted to finding ways of refining the descriptive mechanisms of phrase-structure grammar and transformation rules such that exactly the kinds of things can be expressed that natural language actually allows. Allowing arbitrary transformations does not meet that goal: they are much too powerful, being [[Turing complete]] unless significant restrictions are added (e.g. no transformations that introduce and then rewrite symbols in a context-free fashion).\n\nChomsky's general position regarding the non-context-freeness of natural language has held up since then,<ref name=\"shieber1985\">{{citation | title=Evidence against the context-freeness of natural language | year=1985 | last=Shieber | first=Stuart | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=333\u2013343 | url=http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~shieber/Biblio/Papers/shieber85.pdf | doi=10.1007/BF00630917 | issue=3}}.</ref> although his specific examples regarding the inadequacy of context-free grammars in terms of their weak generative capacity were later disproved.<ref name=\"pullum-gazdar1982\">{{citation | title=Natural languages and context-free languages | year=1982 | last=Pullum | first=Geoffrey K. | author2=Gerald Gazdar | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=4 | pages=471\u2013504 | doi=10.1007/BF00360802 | issue=4}}.</ref>\n[[Gerald Gazdar]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum]] have argued that despite a few non-context-free constructions in natural language (such as [[cross-serial dependencies]] in [[Swiss German]]<ref name=\"shieber1985\"/> and [[reduplication]] in [[Bambara language|Bambara]]<ref name=\"culy1985\">{{citation | title=The Complexity of the Vocabulary of Bambara | year=1985 | last=Culy | first=Christopher | journal=Linguistics and Philosophy | volume=8 | pages=345\u2013351 | doi=10.1007/BF00630918 | issue=3}}.</ref>), the vast majority of forms in natural language are indeed context-free.<ref name=\"pullum-gazdar1982\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Parsing expression grammar]]\n* [[Stochastic context-free grammar]]\n* [[Context-free grammar generation algorithms|Algorithms for context-free grammar generation]]\n* [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages]]\n\n=== Parsing algorithms ===\n* [[CYK algorithm]]\n* [[GLR parser]]\n* [[LL parser]]\n* [[Earley algorithm]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{citation|first1=John E.|last1=Hopcroft|author1-link=John Hopcroft|first2=Jeffrey D.|last2=Ullman|author2-link=Jeffrey Ullman|title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation|publisher=Addison-Wesley|year=1979}}.

Previously granted unitary patents will not automatically get their unitary effect extended to the territory of participating states which ratify the UPC agreement at a later date. \n\nThe negotiations which resulted in the unitary patent can be traced back to various initiatives dating to the 1970s.

Instead, unitary patents will be accepted in English, French, or German with no further translation required after grant.{{refn|There is a transition period of maximum 12 years during which there will be one translation made, either into English if the application is in French or German, or into any EU official language if the application was in English.|group=notes}} [[Machine translation]]s will be provided, but will be, in the words of the regulation, \"for information purposes only and should not have any legal effect\".<ref>Regulation 1260/2012, whereas #11</ref>  The maintenance fees, with a single fee for the whole area, are also expected to be lower compared to renewal fees for the whole area but the fees have yet to be announced.\n\nThe proposed unitary patent will be a particular type of European patent, granted under the [[European Patent Convention]]. A European patent, once granted, becomes a \"bundle of nationally enforceable patents\", in the states which are designated by the applicant, and the unitary effect would effectively create a single enforceable region in a subgroup of those 38 states, which may coexist with nationally enforceable patents (\"classical\" patents) in the remaining states.{{refn|Similarly, Switzerland and Liechtenstein created a separate unitary patent under the European Patent Convention. However, the [[unitary patent for Switzerland and Liechtenstein]] is the only possible way to obtain a patent in these two countries.

In contrast, the existence of the EU unitary patent will still permit a patent proprietor not to choose the EU unitary patent and to rather select specific countries.|group=notes}} \"Classical\", non-unitary European patents hold exclusively for single countries and require the filing of a translation in some contracting states, in accordance with {{EPC Article|65}}.{{refn|Although the filing of a translation under {{EPC Article|65}} is often referred to as \"validation\", this term is in fact not used in the European Patent Convention.

A more substantive harmonisation took place at around the same time to take account of the European Patent Convention and the [[Convention on the Unification of Certain Points of Substantive Law on Patents for Invention|Strasbourg Convention]].\n\n===2000 to 2004: EU Regulation proposal===\nIn 2000, renewed efforts from the European Union resulted in a Community Patent [[European Union regulation|Regulation]] proposal, sometimes abbreviated as '''CPR'''. It provides that the patent, once it has been granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) in one of its procedural languages (English, German or French) and published in that language, with a translation of the claims into the two other procedural languages, will be valid without any further translation. This proposal is aimed to achieve a considerable reduction in translation costs.\n\nNevertheless, additional translations could become necessary in legal proceedings against a suspected infringer. In such a situation, a suspected infringer who has been unable to consult the text of the patent in the official language of the Member State in which he is domiciled, is presumed, until proven otherwise, not to have knowingly infringed the patent. To protect a suspected infringer who, in such a situation, has not acted in a deliberate manner, it is provided that the proprietor of the patent will not be able to obtain damages in respect of the period prior to the translation of the patent being notified to the infringer.\n\nThe proposed Community Patent Regulation should also establish a court holding exclusive jurisdiction to invalidate issued patents; thus, a Community Patent's validity will be the same in all EU member states. This court will be attached to the present [[European Court of Justice]] and [[Court of First Instance]] through use of provisions in the [[Treaty of Nice]].\n\nDiscussion regarding the Community patent had made clear progress in 2003 when a political agreement was reached on 3 March 2003. However, one year later in March 2004 under the Irish [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]], the [[Council of the European Union#Configurations|Competitiveness Council]] failed to agree on the details of the Regulation. In particular the time delays for translating the claims and the authentic text of the claims in case of an infringement remained problematic issues throughout discussions and in the end proved insoluble.\n\nIn view of the difficulties in reaching an agreement on the community patent,<ref>Axel H.

From the point of view of the European Commission the Community Patent is an essential step towards creating a level playing field for trade within the European Union. For smaller businesses, if the Community patent achieves its aim of providing a relatively inexpensive way of obtaining patent protection across a wide trading area, then there is also support. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nFor larger businesses, however, other issues come into play, which have tended to dilute overall support. In general, these businesses recognise that the current European Patent system provides the best possible protection given the need to satisfy national sovereignty requirements such as regarding translation and enforcement. The Community Patent proposal was generally supported if it would do away with both of these issues, but there was some concern about the level of competence of the proposed European Patent Court. A business would be reluctant to obtain a Europe-wide patent if it ran the risk of being revoked by an inexperienced judge. Also, the question of translations would not go away \u2013 unless the users of the system could see significant change in the position of some of the countries holding out for more of a patent specification to be translated on grant or before enforcement, it was understood that larger businesses (the bulk of the users of the patent system) would be unlikely to move away from the tried and tested European Patent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\n===Since 2005: stalemate and new debate===\n[[Image:Charlie McCreevy portrait.jpg|thumb|left|In 2007, [[Charlie McCreevy]] was quoted as saying that the proposal for an EU-wide patent was stuck in the [[mud]].]]\n\nThus, in 2005, the Community patent looked unlikely to be implemented in the near future.

We say that the mutation is recessive because the organism will exhibit the [[wild type]] [[phenotype]] (ordinary trait) unless both chromosomes of a pair have the mutation ([[homozygous]] mutation). Similarly, suppose a mutation at another position, <math>y</math>, is responsible for the same recessive trait. The positions <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are said to be within the same cistron when an organism that has the mutation at <math>x</math> on one chromosome and has the mutation at position <math>y</math> on the paired chromosome exhibits the recessive trait even though the organism is not homozygous for either mutation. When instead the wild type trait is expressed, the positions are said to belong to distinct cistrons / genes. It's important to know that cistron localization has been studied for several years, and, depending of the organism, this gene can be found in different places. For example, the gene can be found in RNA phage and is related to the cistron coat in some particular organisms.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hindley J, Staples DH, Billeter MA, Weissmann C | title = Location of the coat cistron on the RNA of phage Q-beta | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 67 | issue = 3 | pages = 1180\u20137 | date = November 1970 | pmid = 5274447 | jstor = 60432 | doi=10.1073/pnas.67.3.1180 | pmc=283334}}</ref> Some examples of the organisms that have been study are Tobacco, grapevine.\n\nFor example, an [[operon]] is a stretch of DNA that is [[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]] to create a contiguous segment of [[RNA]], but contains more than one cistron / gene.

Historically it has sometimes been synonymous with \"[[republic]]\". The noun \"commonwealth\", meaning \"public welfare general good or advantage\" dates from the 15th century. Originally a phrase (the common-wealth or the common weal \u2013 echoed in the modern synonym \"public weal\") it comes from the old meaning of \"[[wealth]]\", which is \"well-being\", and is itself a loose translation of the Latin [[res publica]] (republic). The term literally meant \"common well-being\". In the 17th century, the definition of \"commonwealth\" expanded from its original sense of \"[[public welfare]]\" or \"[[wikt:commonweal|commonweal]]\" to mean \"a state in which the supreme power is vested in the people; a republic or [[democracy|democratic state]]\".\n\nThe term evolved to become a title to a number of political entities. Three countries \u2013 [[Australia]], the [[Bahamas]], and [[Dominica]] \u2013 have the official title \"Commonwealth\", as do four [[U.S. state]]s and two [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]. More recently, the term has been used to name some fraternal associations of nations, most notably the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], an organization primarily of former territories of the [[British Empire]], which is often referred to as simply \"the Commonwealth\".\n\n==Historical use==\n\n===Rome===\n\nTranslations of Roman writers' works to English have on occasion translated \"''[[Res publica]]''\", and variants thereof, to \"the commonwealth\", a term referring to the Roman state as a whole.\n\n===England===\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of England]] was the official name of the political unit (''de facto'' military rule in the name of parliamentary supremacy) that replaced the [[Kingdom of England]] (after the [[English Civil War]]) from 1649\u201353 and 1659\u201360, under the rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and his son and successor [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]]. From 1653 to 1659, although still legally known as a Commonwealth, the republic, united with the former [[Kingdom of Scotland]], operated under different institutions (at times as a ''de facto'' monarchy) and is known by historians as the Protectorate. In a British context, it is sometimes referred to as the \"Old Commonwealth\".{{cn|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Iceland===\n\nThe [[Icelandic Commonwealth]] or the [[Icelandic Free State]] ({{lang-is|\u00dej\u00f3\u00f0veldi\u00f0}}) was the state existing in Iceland between the establishment of the [[Althing]] in 930 and the pledge of fealty to the [[King of Norway|Norwegian king]] in 1262. It was initially established by a public consisting largely of recent immigrants from [[Norway]] who had fled the unification of that country under [[King]] [[Harald Fairhair]].\n\n===Philippines===\n{{main|History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)}}\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] was the administrative body that governed the [[Philippines]] from 1935 to 1946, aside from a [[government in exile|period of exile]] in the [[Second World War]] from 1942 to 1945 when [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japan occupied the country]]. It replaced the [[Insular Government]], a [[territory of the United States|United States territorial]] government, and was established by the [[Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act]].  The Commonwealth was designed as a transitional administration in preparation for the country's full achievement of independence, which was achieved in 1946.\n\n===Poland\u2013Lithuania===\n{{Main|Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth}}\n\n''Republic'' is still an alternative translation of the traditional name of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. [[Wincenty Kad\u0142ubek]] (Vincent Kadlubo, 1160\u20131223) used for the first time the original Latin term ''[[res publica]]'' in the context of Poland in his \"Chronicles of the Kings and Princes of Poland\". The name was used officially for the confederal country formed by [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] 1569\u20131795.\n\nIt is also often referred as \"[[Golden Liberty|Nobles' Commonwealth]]\" (1505\u20131795, i.e., before the union). In the contemporary political doctrine of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, \"our state is a Republic (or Commonwealth) under the presidency of the King\". The Commonwealth introduced a doctrine of religious tolerance called [[Warsaw Confederation]], had its own parliament ''[[Sejm]]'' (although elections were restricted to [[nobility]] and [[elected king]]s, who were bound to certain contracts ''[[Pacta conventa (Poland)|Pacta conventa]]'' from the beginning of the reign).\n\n\"A commonwealth of good counsaile\" was the title of the 1607 English translation of the work of [[Wawrzyniec Grzyma\u0142a Go\u015blicki]] \"De optimo senatore\" that presented to English readers many of the ideas present in the political system of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\n===Catalonia===\n{{Main|Commonwealth of Catalonia}}\n\nBetween 1914 and 1925, [[Catalonia]] was an autonomous region of Spain. Its government during that time was given the title ''[[mancomunidad]]'' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''mancomunitat''), which is translated into English as \"commonwealth\". The [[Commonwealth of Catalonia]] had limited powers and was formed as a federation of the four Catalan provinces. A number of Catalan-language institutions were created during its existence.\n\n===Liberia===\n{{See also|History of Liberia#Colonization (1821\u20131847)}}\n\nBetween 1838 and 1847, [[Liberia]] was officially known as the \"Commonwealth of Liberia\". It changed its name to the \"Republic of Liberia\" when it declared independence (and adopted a new constitution) in 1847.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1985/liberia_1_commonwealth.htm The Commonwealth of Liberia]</ref>\n\n==Current use==\n\n===Australia===\n\n\"Commonwealth\" was first proposed as a term for a federation of the six Australian [[crown colony|crown colonies]] at the [[Constitutional Convention (Australia)#1891 convention|1891 constitutional convention]] in [[Sydney]]. Its adoption was initially controversial, as it was associated by some with the republicanism of [[Oliver Cromwell]] ([[#England|see above]]), but it was retained in all subsequent drafts of the constitution.<ref>Helen Irving.

Retrieved 15 July 2015.</ref> The term was finally incorporated into law in the ''[[Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act]] 1901'', which established the federation. Australia operates under a federal system, in which power is divided between the federal (national) government and the [[States and territories of Australia|state governments]] (the successors of the six colonies). So, in an Australian context, the term \"Commonwealth\" (capitalized) refers to the [[Government of Australia|federal government]], and \"Commonwealth of Australia\" is the official name of the country.\n\n===The Bahamas===\n\n[[The Bahamas]] uses the official style ''Commonwealth of The Bahamas''.\n\n===Dominica===\n\nThe small [[Caribbean]] republic of [[Dominica]] has used the official style ''Commonwealth of Dominica'' since 1970.\n\n===Certain U.S. states and territories===\n\n====States====\n{{Main|Commonwealth (U.S. state)}}\n\nFour [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]] officially designate themselves as \"commonwealths\".

As such, they share a strong influence of English [[common law]] in some of their laws and institutions.

The [[Head of the Commonwealth]] is Queen [[Elizabeth II]], who also reigns as monarch directly in the 16 member states known as [[Commonwealth realm]]s.  \n\n====Commonwealth of Independent States====\n\nThe [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) is a loose [[military alliance|alliance]] or confederation consisting of 10 of the 15 [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Republics]], the exceptions being [[Turkmenistan]] (a CIS associate member), [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] left the CIS in August 2008 after [[2008 South Ossetia war|a clash]] with [[Russia]] over [[South Ossetia]]. Its creation signalled the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], its purpose being to \"allow a civilised divorce\" between the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republics]].

The best-known floppy disk drive for the C64, the 1541 is a single-sided 170-[[kilobyte]] drive for 5\u00bc\" disks. The 1541 directly followed the [[Commodore 1540]] (meant for the [[Commodore VIC-20|VIC-20]]).\n\nThe disk drive uses [[group coded recording]] (GCR) and contains a [[MOS Technology 6502]] microprocessor, doubling as a [[disk controller]] and on-board [[disk operating system]] processor. The number of sectors per track varies from 17 to 21 (an early implementation of [[zone bit recording]]). The drive's built-in disk operating system is [[Commodore DOS|CBM DOS 2.6]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Introduction ===\nThe 1541 was priced at under {{US$|400}} at its introduction. A C64 plus a 1541 cost about $900, while an [[Apple II family|Apple II]] with no disk drive cost $1295. The first 1541 drives produced in 1982 have a label on the front reading VIC-1541 and have an off-white case to match the VIC-20. In 1983, the 1541 was switched to having the familiar beige case and a front label reading simply \"1541\" along with rainbow stripes to match the Commodore 64.\n\nBy 1983 a 1541 sold for $300 or less. After a [[video game crash of 1983|brutal home-computer price war]] that Commodore began, the C64 and 1541 together cost under $500.{{cn|date=October 2017}} The drive became very popular, and became difficult to find. The company claimed that the shortage occurred because 90% of C64 owners bought the 1541 compared to its 30% expectation, but the press discussed what ''[[Creative Computing]]'' described as \"an absolutely alarming return rate\" because of defects. The magazine reported in March 1984 that it received three defective drives in two weeks,<ref name=\"anderson198403\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/creativecomputing-1984-03/Creative_Computing_v10_n03_1984_Mar#page/n57/mode/2up |title=Commodore |work=Creative Computing |date=March 1984 |access-date=2015-02-06 |author-last=Anderson |author-first=John J. |pages=56 |author-link=John J. Anderson}}</ref> and ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' reported in December 1983 that four of the magazine's seven drives had failed; \"COMPUTE! Publications sorely needs additional 1541s for in-house use, yet we can't find any to buy. After numerous phone calls over several days, we were able to locate only two units in the entire continental United States\", reportedly because of Commodore's attempt to resolve [[#Hardware|a manufacturing issue]] that caused the high failures.<ref name=\"halfhill198312\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1983-12-computegazette/Compute_Gazette_Issue_06_1983_Dec#page/n7/mode/2up |title=The Editor's Notes |work=Compute!'s Gazette |date=December 1983 |access-date=2016-02-06 |author-last=Halfhill |author-first=Tom |pages=6 |type=editorial}}</ref>\n\nThe early (1982 to 1983) 1541s have a spring-eject mechanism ([[Alps Electric|Alps]] drive), and the disks often fail to release. This style of drive has the popular nickname \"Toaster Drive\", because it requires the use of a knife or other hard thin object to pry out the stuck media just like a piece of [[toast]] stuck in an actual [[toaster]] (though this is inadvisable with actual toasters). This was fixed later when Commodore changed the vendor of the drive mechanism ([[Mitsumi]]) and adopted the flip-lever Newtronics mechanism, greatly improving reliability. In addition, Commodore made the drive's controller board smaller and reduced its chip count compared to the early 1541s (which had a large PCB running the length of the case, with dozens of TTL chips). The beige-case Newtronics 1541 was produced from 1984 to 1986.\n\n=== Versions and third-party clones ===\n[[File:Commodore 1541 white.jpg|thumb|1541C, the first upgrade version]]\n\nAll but the very earliest non-II model 1541s can use either the Alps or Newtronics mechanism. Visually, the first models, of the ''VIC-1541'' denomination, have an off-white color like the VIC-20 and VIC-1540. Then, to match the look of the C64, [[Commodore International|CBM]] changed the drive's color to brown-beige and the name to ''Commodore 1541''.\n\n[[Image:C64-IMG 5372.jpg|thumb|Commodore 1541-II, the second of two upgraded versions of the CBM 1541. The 1541-II has the more modern \"radial handle\" locking mechanism.]]\n\nThe 1541's numerous shortcomings opened a market for a number of third-party clones of the disk drive, a situation that continued for the lifetime of the C64. Well-known clones are the ''Oceanic OC-118'' a.k.a. ''Excelerator+'', the [[MSD Super Disk]] single and dual drives, the ''Enhancer 2000'', the ''[[Indus GT]]'', and ''[[Creative Micro Designs|CMD]]'' 's ''FD-2000'' and ''FD-4000''. Nevertheless, the 1541 became the first disk drive to see widespread use in the home and Commodore sold millions of the units.\n\nIn 1986, Commodore released the 1541C, a revised version that offered quieter and slightly more reliable operation and a light beige case matching the color scheme of the Commodore 64C. It was replaced in 1988 by the 1541-II, which uses an external power supply to provide cooler operation and allows the drive to have a smaller desktop footprint (the power supply \"brick\" being placed elsewhere, typically on the floor). Later ROM revisions fixed assorted problems, including a software bug that caused the save-and-replace command to corrupt data.\n\n=== Successors ===\nThe [[Commodore 1570]] is an upgrade from the 1541 for use with the [[Commodore 128]], available in Europe. It offers [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] capability for accessing CP/M disks, improved speed, and somewhat quieter operation, but was only manufactured until Commodore got its production lines going with the [[Commodore 1571|1571]], the double-sided drive. Finally, the small, external-power-supply-based, MFM-based [[Commodore 1581]] 3\u00bd\" drive was made, giving 800 KB access to the C128 and C64.\n\n== Design ==\n\n=== Hardware ===\nThe 1541 does not have [[DIP switch]]es to change the device number. If a user added more than one drive to a system the user had to open the case and cut a trace in the circuit board to permanently change the drive's device number, or hand-wire an external switch to allow it to be changed externally.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/run-magazine-28/Run_Issue_28_1986_Apr#page/n83/mode/2up |title=RUN Magazine issue 28}}</ref> It was also possible to change the drive number via a software command, which was temporary and would be erased as soon as the drive was powered off.\n\n1541 drives at power up always default to device #8. If multiple drives in a chain are used, then the startup procedure is to power on the first drive in the chain, alter its device number via a software command to the highest number in the chain (if three drives were used, then the first drive in the chain would be set to device #10), then power on the next drive, alter its device number to the next lowest, and repeat the procedure until the final drive at the end of the chain was powered on and left as device #8.\n\nUnlike the Apple II, where support for two drives was normal, it was relatively uncommon for Commodore software to support this setup, and the CBM DOS copy file command was not even able to copy files between drives--a third party copy utility must be used instead.\n\nThe pre-II 1541s also have an internal power source, which generate much heat. The heat generation was a frequent source of humour. For example, ''[[Compute!]]'' stated in 1988 that \"Commodore 64s used to be a favorite with amateur and professional chefs since they could compute and cook on top of their 1500-series disk drives at the same time\".<ref name=\"levitan198812\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/1988-12-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_103_1988_Dec#page/n105/mode/2up |title=Levitations |work=Compute! | date=December 1988 |access-date=2013-11-10 |author-last=Levitan |author-first=Arlan |pages=104}}</ref> A series of humorous tips in ''[[MikroBitti]]'' in 1989 said \"When programming late, coffee and kebab keep nicely warm on top of the 1541.\" The ''MikroBitti'' review of the 1541-II said that its external power source \"should end the jokes about toasters\".\n\nThe drive-head mechanism installed in the early production years is notoriously easy to misalign. The most common cause of the 1541's drive head knocking and subsequent misalignment is copy-protection schemes on commercial software.{{r|info19860506}} The main cause of the problem is that the disk drive itself does not feature any means of detecting when the read/write head reaches track zero. Accordingly, when a disk is not formatted or a disk error occurs, the unit tries to move the head 40 times in the direction of track zero (although the 1541 DOS only uses 35 tracks, the drive mechanism itself is a 40-track unit, so this ensured track zero would be reached no matter where the head was before). Once track zero is reached, every further attempt to move the head in that direction would cause it to be rammed against a solid stop: for example, if the head happened to be on track 18 (where the directory is located) before this procedure, the head would be actually moved 18 times, and then rammed against the stop 22 times. This ramming gives the characteristic \"machine gun\" noise and sooner or later throws the head out of alignment.\n\nA defective head-alignment part likely caused many of the reliability issues in early 1541 drives; one dealer told ''Compute!{{'}}s Gazette'' in 1983 that the part had caused all but three of several hundred drive failures that he had repaired.{{r|halfhill198312}} The drives were so unreliable that ''[[Info (magazine)|Info]]'' magazine joked, \"Sometimes it seems as if one of the original design specs ... must have said 'Mean time between failure: 10 accesses.'\". Users can realign the drive themselves with a software program and a calibration disk. What the user would do is remove the drive from its case and then loosen the screws holding the stepper motor that moved the head, then with the calibration disk in the drive gently turn the stepper motor back and forth until the program shows a good alignment. The screws are then tightened and the drive is put back into its case.<ref name=\"info19860506\">{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/info-magazine-10/Info_Issue_10_1986_May-Jun#page/n57/mode/2up |title=Physical Exam |work=Info |date=May\u2013June 1986 |access-date=2013-10-06 |pages=57}}</ref>\n\nA third-party fix for the 1541 appeared where the solid head stop was replaced by a sprung stop, giving the head a much easier life.{{r|info19860506}} The later [[Commodore 1571|1571]] drive (which is 1541-compatible) incorporates track-zero detection by photo-interrupter and is thus immune to the problem. Also, a software solution, which resides in the drive controller's ROM, prevents the rereads from occurring, though this could cause problems when genuine errors did occur.\n\nDue to the alignment issues on the Alps drive mechanisms, Commodore switched suppliers to Newtronics in 1984. The Newtronics mechanism drives have a lever rather than a pull-down tab to close the drive door. Although the alignment issues were resolved after the switch, the Newtronics drives added a new reliability problem in that many of the read/write heads were improperly sealed, causing moisture to penetrate the head and short it out.\n\nThe 1541's PCB consists mainly of a 6502 CPU, two 6522 chips, and 2k of work RAM. Up to 48k of RAM can be added, this was mainly useful for defeating copy protection schemes since an entire disk track could be loaded into drive RAM, while the standard 2k only accommodated a few sectors (theoretically eight, but some of the RAM was used by CBM DOS as work space). Some Commodore users used 1541s with expanded RAM as an impromptu math coprocessor by uploading math-intensive code to the drive for background processing.\n\n=== Interface ===\nThe 1541 uses a [[Commodore bus|proprietary serialized derivative]] of the [[IEEE-488]] parallel interface, which Commodore used on their previous disk drives for the [[Commodore PET|PET/CBM]] range of personal and business computers<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thegeekpub.com/9473/sd2iec-manual-use-sd2iec-c64/|title=SD2IEC MANUAL (HOW TO USE THE SD2IEC ON THE C64)|publisher=The Geek Pub|accessdate= December 8, 2017}}</ref>, but when the VIC-20 was in development, a cheaper alternative to the expensive IEE-488 cables was sought. To ensure a ready supply of inexpensive cabling for its home computer peripherals, Commodore chose standard [[DIN connector]]s for the serial interface. Disk drives and other peripherals such as printers connected to the computer via a [[daisy chain (electrical engineering)|daisy chain]] setup, necessitating only a single connector on the computer itself.\n\n== Throughput and software ==\n''[[IEEE Spectrum]]'' in 1985 stated that<ref name=\"ieee85\">{{cite journal |author-last2=Wallich |author-first2=Paul |date=March 1985 |title=Design case history: the Commodore 64 |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/ns/pdfs/commodore64_mar1985.pdf |journal=[[IEEE Spectrum]] |pages=48\u201358 |issn=0018-9235 |author-last1=Perry |author-first1=Tekla S. |access-date=2011-11-12}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The one major flaw of the C-64 is not in the machine itself, but in its disk drive. With a reasonably fast disk drive and an adequate disk-operating system (DOS), the C-64 could compete in the business market with the Apple and perhaps with other business computers. With the present disk drive, though, it is hard-pressed to lose its image as a toy.}}\n\nThe C-64's designers blamed the 1541's slow speed on the marketing department's insistence that the computer be compatible with the 1540, which was slow because of a flaw in the [[MOS Technology 6522|6522 VIA]] interface controller.{{r|ieee85}} Initially, Commodore intended to use a hardware shift register (one component of the 6522) to maintain fast drive speeds with the new serial interface. However, a hardware bug with this chip prevented the initial design from working as anticipated, and the ROM code was hastily rewritten to handle the entire operation in software. According to [[Jim Butterfield]], this causes a speed reduction by a factor of five;<ref>http://www.binarydinosaurs.co.uk/Museum/Commodore/c64/c64notes.php</ref> had 1540 compatibility not been a requirement, the disk interface would have been much faster. In any case, the C64 normally could not work with a 1540 unless the VIC-II video output was disabled via a register write, which would increase the CPU speed enough to be able to access it.\n\nAs implemented on the VIC-20 and C64, [[Commodore DOS]] transfers 512 bytes per second, compared to the [[Atari 810]]'s 1000 bytes per second, the Apple [[Disk II]]'s 15,000 bytes per second,{{r|ieee85}} and the 300-baud data rate of the Commodore [[Datasette]] storage system. About 20 minutes are needed to copy one disk&mdash;10 minutes of reading time, and 10 minutes of writing time. However, since both the computer and the drive can easily be reprogrammed, third parties quickly wrote more efficient firmware that would speed up drive operations drastically. Without hardware modifications, some \"[[fast loader]]\" utilities managed to achieve speeds of up to 4 kB/s. The most common of these products are the [[Epyx FastLoad]], the [[The Final Cartridge III|Final Cartridge]], and the [[Action Replay (cartridge)|Action Replay]] plug-in [[ROM cartridge]]s, which all have [[machine code monitor]] and [[disk editor]] software on board as well. The popular Commodore computer magazines of the era also entered the arena with type-in fast-load utilities, with ''[[Compute!'s Gazette]]'' publishing ''TurboDisk'' in 1985 and ''[[RUN (magazine)|RUN]]'' publishing ''Sizzle'' in 1987.\n\nEven though each 1541 has its own on-board disk controller and disk [[operating system]], it is not normally possible for a user to command two 1541 drives to copy a disk (one drive reading and the other writing) as with older dual drives like the [[Commodore 4040|4040]] and [[Commodore 8050|8050]] that were often found with the PET computer, and which the 1541 is backward-compatible with (it can read 4040 disks but not write to them since its internal operating system is similar enough for reading but not for writing). Unfortunately, however, the routines in the previous disk operating system to enable disk copying were removed for the 1541 as it was intended to be a stand-alone unit. Originally, to copy from drive to drive, software running on the C64 was needed and it would first read from one drive into computer memory, then write out to the other. Only later when first, [[Fast Hack'em]], then other disk backup programs, were released, was true drive-to-drive copying possible for a pair of 1541s. The user could then unplug the C64 from the drives (i.e. from the first drive in the daisy chain) and do something else with the computer as the drives proceeded to copy the entire disk. This is not a recommended practice as disconnecting the serial lead from a powered drive and/or computer can result in destruction of one or both of the port chips in the disk drive.\n\n== Media ==\nThe 1541 drive uses standard 5.25\" double density floppy media, high density media will not work due to its different magnetic coating requiring a higher magnetic coercivity. As the GCR encoding scheme does not use the index hole, the drive was also compatible with hard-sectored disks. The standard CBM DOS format is 170k with 35 tracks and 256 byte sectors. It is similar to the format used on the PET 4040 drives, but a minor different in a header byte made the 4040 and 1541 only read-compatible, disks formatted with one drive cannot be written to by the other.\n\nThe 4040 drives used Shugart SA-400s, which were 35-track units, thus the format there was due to physical limitations of the drive mechanism. The 1541 used 40 track mechanisms, but Commodore intentionally limited the CBM DOS format to 35 tracks because of reliability issues with the early units. It was possible via low-level programming to move the drive head to tracks 36-40 and write on them, this was sometimes done by commercial software for copy protection purposes or to get additional data on the disk.\n\nHowever, one track is reserved by DOS for directory and file allocation information (the BAM, [[block availability map]]). And since for normal files, two bytes of each physical sector are used by DOS as a pointer to the next physical track and sector of the file, only 254 out of the 256 bytes of a block are used for file contents.\n\nIf the disk side was not otherwise prepared with a custom format, (e.g. for data disks), 664 blocks would be free after formatting, giving 664 \u00d7 254 = 168,656 bytes (or almost 165 kB) for user data.\n\nBy using custom formatting and load/save routines (sometimes included in third-party DOSes, see below), all of the mechanically possible 40 tracks can be used.\n\nOwing to the drive's non-use of the index hole, it was also possible to make \"flippy\" disks by inserting the diskette upside-down and formatting the other side, and it was commonplace and normal for commercial software to be distributed on such disks.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \n!

Track 18 is reserved; the remaining tracks are available for data storage. The header is on 18/0 (track 18, sector 0) along with the BAM (block availability map), and the directory starts on 18/1 (track 18, sector 1). The file interleave is 10 blocks, while the directory interleave is 3 blocks.\n\nHeader contents: The header is similar to other Commodore disk headers, the structural differences being the BAM offset ($04) and size, and the label+ID+type offset ($90).\n\n $00\u201301 T/S reference to first directory sector (18/1)\n     02 DOS version ('A')\n  04-8F BAM entries (4 bytes per track: Free Sector Count + 24 bits for sectors)\n  90-9F Disk Label, $A0 padded\n  A2-A3 Disk ID\n  A5-A6 DOS type ('2A')\n\n== Uses ==\nEarly [[copy protection]] schemes deliberately introduced read errors on the disk, the software refusing to load unless the correct error message is returned. The general idea was that simple disk-copy programs are incapable of copying the errors. When one of these errors is encountered, the disk drive (as do many floppy disk drives) will attempt one or more reread attempts after first resetting the head to track zero. Few of these schemes had much deterrent effect, as various software companies soon released \"[[Bit_nibbler|nibbler]]\" utilities that enabled protected disks to be copied and, in some cases, the protection removed.\n\nCommodore copy protection sometimes depends on specific hardware configurations.

The drive stores 800 [[kilobyte]]s using an [[Modified Frequency Modulation|MFM]] encoding<ref name=dd81>[http://personalpages.tds.net/~rcarlsen/cbm/1581.txt tds.net - 1581 DISK DRIVE DIAGNOSTICS, latest updates and corrections 7-13-05]</ref> but formats different from the [[MS-DOS]] (720 kB), [[Amiga]] (880 kB), and [[Macintosh Plus|Mac Plus]] (800 kB) formats. With special software it's possible to read C1581 disks on an x86 PC system, and likewise, read MS-DOS and other formats of disks in the C1581 (using Big Blue Reader), provided that the PC or other floppy handles the {{nowrap|\"720 kB\"}} size format.<ref name=dd81/> This capability was most frequently used to read MS-DOS disks. The drive was released in the summer of 1987 and quickly became popular with [[bulletin board system|bulletin board system (BBS)]] operators and other users.\n\nLike the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1571|1571]], the 1581 has an onboard [[MOS Technology 6502]] CPU with its own ROM and RAM, and uses a serial version of the [[IEEE-488]] interface. Inexplicably, the drive's ROM contains commands for parallel use, although no parallel interface was available. Unlike the 1571, which is nearly 100% backward-compatible with the 1541, the 1581 is only compatible with previous Commodore drives at the DOS level and cannot utilize software that performs low-level disk access (as the vast majority of Commodore 64 games do).\n\nThe version of [[Commodore DOS]] built into the 1581 added support for [[Disk partitioning|partitions]], which could also function as fixed-allocation [[Directory (computing)|subdirectories]].  PC-style subdirectories were rejected as being too difficult to work with in terms of block availability maps, then still much in vogue, and which for some time had been the traditional way of inquiring into block availability.  The 1581 supports the [[Commodore 128|C128's]] burst mode for fast disk access, but not when connected to an older Commodore machine like the [[Commodore 64]]. The 1581 provides a total of 3160 blocks free when formatted (a block being equal to 256 [[byte]]s). The number of permitted directory entries was also increased, to 296 entries. With a storage capacity of 800 kB, the 1581 is the highest-capacity serial-bus drive that was ever made by Commodore (the 1-MB SFD-1001 uses the parallel IEEE-488), and the only 3\u00bd\" one. However, starting in 1991, [[Creative Micro Designs|Creative Micro Designs (CMD)]] made the [[CMD FD-2000|FD-2000]] [[high density]] (1.6&nbsp;MB) and [[CMD FD-4000|FD-4000]] [[extra-high density]] (3.2&nbsp;MB) 3\u00bd\" drives, both of which offered not only a 1581-emulation mode but also 1541- and 1571-compatibility modes.\n\nLike the [[Commodore 1541|1541]] and [[Commodore 1571|1571]], a nearly identical [[job queue]] is available to the user in [[zero page]] (except for job 0), providing for exceptional degrees of compatibility.\n\nUnlike the cases of the 1541 and 1571, the low-level disk format used by the 1581 is similar enough to the MS-DOS format as the 1581 is built around a [[Western Digital FD1771|WD1770]] FM/MFM floppy controller chip. The 1581 disk format consists of 80 tracks and ten 512 byte sectors per track, used as 20 logical sectors of 256 bytes each<!-- The cited document makes clear that the 256 byte sectors are logical, and that the physical disk format is 512 byte sectors. Also, having just implemented an MFM decoder for 1581 disks, I can confirm that the physical sectors are most definitely 512 bytes, and that there are 10 of them. -->. Special software is required to read 1581 disks on a PC due to the different file system. An internal floppy drive and controller are required as well; USB floppy drives operate strictly at the file system level and do not allow low-level disk access.<ref>{{cite web|title=The floppy controller evolution &#124; OS/2 Museum |date=2007-02-27 |accessdate=2016-05-12 |url=ftp://ftp.mirrorservice.org/sites/www.bitsavers.org/pdf/standardMicrosystems/_dataSheets/USB97CFDC2-01.pdf |quote=  Supports 640K, 720K, 1.44M, 1.2M Windows 98J, and 1.2M NEC DOS 6.x Formats}}</ref>  The WD1770<!--assumed it was the 1770 version that caused problems, and the 1772 was ok--> controller chip, however, was the seat of some early problems with 1581 drives when the first production runs were recalled due to a high failure rate; the problem was quickly corrected.

By the 1840s, students at [[Rugby School]] were playing a game in which players were able to pick up the ball and run with it, a sport later known as [[Rugby football]]. The game was taken to Canada by British soldiers stationed there and was soon being played at Canadian colleges.\n\nThe first documented gridiron football match was played at [[University College, University of Toronto|University College]], a college of the [[University of Toronto]], November 9, 1861. One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) [[William Mulock]], later Chancellor of the school. A football club was formed at the university soon afterward, although its rules of play at this stage are unclear.\n\nIn 1864, at [[Trinity College (University of Toronto)|Trinity College]], also a college of the University of Toronto, F. Barlow Cumberland and Frederick A. Bethune devised rules based on rugby football. Modern Canadian football is widely regarded as having originated with a game played in Montreal, in 1865, when British Army officers played local civilians. The game gradually gained a following, and the [[Montreal Football Club]] was formed in 1868, the first recorded non-university football club in Canada.\n\n===American college football===\nEarly games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \"[[mob football]]\" played in Great Britain. The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when [[Intramural sports|intramural]] games of football began to be played on college campuses. Each school played its own variety of football. [[Princeton University]] students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820. A [[Harvard University|Harvard]] tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes.  In 1860, both the town police and the college authorities agreed the Bloody Monday had to go.  The Harvard students responded by going into mourning for a mock figure called \"Football Fightum\", for whom they conducted funeral rites. The authorities held firm and it was a dozen years before football was once again played at Harvard. [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] played its own version called \"[[Old division football]]\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple, violence and injury were common.<ref name=PFRA1/><ref name=ODF>{{cite web | last = Meacham | first = Scott | title = Old Division Football, The Indigenous Mob Soccer Of Dartmouth College (pdf) | publisher = dartmo.com | year = 2006 | url = http://www.dartmo.com/football/Football_Meacham.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate = 2007-05-16}}</ref> The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. [[Yale University|Yale]], under pressure from the city of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], banned the play of all forms of football in 1860.<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\nAmerican football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] described the period between 1869 and 1875 as the 'Pioneer Period'; the years 1876\u201393 he called the 'Period of the American Intercollegiate Football Association'; and the years 1894\u20131933 he dubbed the 'Period of Rules Committees and Conferences'.<ref name = UND>{{cite web|url=http://www.und.com/sports/m-footbl/archive/nd-m-fb-a-nattit.html|title=Notre Dame Football :: UND.COM :: The Official Site of Notre Dame Athletics|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Princeton-Columbia-Yale-Rutgers====\n{{main|1869 college football season}}\n\nOn November 6, 1869, [[Rutgers University]] faced [[Princeton University]] (then known as the College of New Jersey) in the first-ever game of intercollegiate football. It was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used a set of rules suggested by Rutgers captain William J. Leggett, based on the [[Football Association]]'s first set of rules, which were an early attempt by the former pupils of England's public schools, to unify the rules of their public schools games and create a universal and standardized set of rules for the game of football and bore little resemblance to the American game which would be developed in the following decades.  It is still usually regarded as the first game of college football.<ref name=PFRA1/><ref name=histfoot>{{cite web | title = The History of Football | work=The History of Sports | publisher=Saperecom | year = 2007 | url = http://www.historyoffootball.net/ | accessdate =2007-05-15}}</ref><ref name=\"NFL1869\">{{cite web | title = NFL History3039\u20131910 | work=NFL.com | publisher=NFL Enterprises LLC | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910 | accessdate =2007-05-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1800s |work=Rutgers Through The Years |publisher=Rutgers University |url=http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |accessdate=2007-05-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070120202924/http://ruweb.rutgers.edu/timeline/1800.htm |archivedate=2007-01-20 |df= }}</ref>  The game was played at a Rutgers field. Two teams of 25 players attempted to score by kicking the ball into the opposing team's goal. Throwing or carrying the ball was not allowed, but there was plenty of physical contact between players. The first team to reach six goals was declared the winner. Rutgers won by a score of six to four. A rematch was played at Princeton a week later under Princeton's own set of rules (one notable difference was the awarding of a \"free kick\" to any player that caught the ball on the fly, which was a feature adopted from the Football Association's rules; the [[fair catch kick]] rule has survived through to modern American game). Princeton won that game by a score of 8 \u2013 0. [[Columbia University|Columbia]] joined the series in 1870, and by 1872 several schools were fielding intercollegiate teams, including Yale and [[Stevens Institute of Technology]].<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\n[[Columbia University]] was the third school to field a team.  The Lions traveled from New York City to New Brunswick on November 12, 1870, and were defeated by Rutgers 6 to 3.  The game suffered from disorganization and the players kicked and battled each other as much as the ball.  Later in 1870, Princeton and Rutgers played again with Princeton defeating Rutgers 6-0.  This game's violence caused such an outcry that no games at all were played in 1871.  Football came back in 1872, when Columbia played Yale for the first time.  The Yale team was coached and captained by David Schley Schaff, who had learned to play football while attending [[Rugby school]].  Schaff himself was injured and unable to the play the game, but Yale won the game 3-0 nonetheless. Later in 1872, Stevens Tech became the fifth school to field a team.  Stevens lost to Columbia, but beat both New York University and City College of New York during the following year.\n\nBy 1873, the college students playing football had made significant efforts to standardize their fledgling game. Teams had been scaled down from 25 players to 20. The only way to score was still to bat or kick the ball through the opposing team's goal, and the game was played in two 45 minute halves on fields 140 yards long and 70 yards wide. On October 20, 1873, representatives from Yale, Columbia, Princeton, and Rutgers met at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City to codify the first set of intercollegiate football rules. Before this meeting, each school had its own set of rules and games were usually played using the home team's own particular code. At this meeting, a list of rules, based more on the Football Association's rules than the rules of the recently founded [[Rugby Football Union]], was drawn up for intercollegiate football games.<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\n====Harvard\u2013McGill (1874)====\n{{main|1874 Harvard vs. McGill football game}}\n\n[[File:1874HarvardMcGill.gif|thumb|upright=1.15|Harvard vs. McGill]]\nOld \"Football Fightum\" had been resurrected at Harvard in 1872, when Harvard resumed playing football.  Harvard, however, preferred to play a rougher version of football called \"the Boston Game\" in which the kicking of a round ball was the most prominent feature though a player could run with the ball, pass it, or dribble it (known as \"babying\"). The man with the ball could be tackled, although hitting, tripping, \"hacking\" (shin-kicking) and other unnecessary roughness was prohibited. There was no limit to the number of players, but there were typically ten to fifteen per side. A player could carry the ball only when being pursued.\n\nAs a result of this, Harvard refused to attend the rules conference organized by Rutgers, Princeton and Columbia at the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York City on October 20, 1873 to agree on a set of rules and regulations that would allow them to play a form of football that was essentially [[Association football]]; and continued to play under its own code. While Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to a challenge to play the rugby team of [[McGill University]], from [[Montreal]], in a two-game series.  It was agreed that two games would be played on Harvard's Jarvis baseball field in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on May 14 and 15, 1874: one to be played under Harvard rules, another under the stricter [[rugby union|rugby]] regulations of McGill. Jarvis Field was at the time a patch of land at the northern point of the Harvard campus, bordered by Everett and Jarvis Streets to the north and south, and Oxford Street and Massachusetts Avenue to the east and west. Harvard beat McGill in the \"Boston Game\" on the Thursday and held McGill to a 0-0 tie on the Friday. The Harvard students took to the rugby rules and adopted them as their own,<ref name=PFRA1>{{cite web | title = No Christian End! | work = The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 | publisher = Professional Football Researchers Association | url = http://www.profootballresearchers.com/articles/No_Christian_End.pdf | accessdate = 2010-01-26}}</ref><ref>[http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=111 Infamous 1874 McGill-Harvard game turns 132] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206062313/http://www.athletics.mcgill.ca/varsity_sports_article.ch2?article_id=111 |date=2006-12-06 }} at McGill Athletics, published by McGill University (no further authorship information available).

Another rule, unique to McGill, was to count [[try|tries]] (the act of grounding the football past the opposing team's goal line; it is important to note that there was no end zone during this time), as well as goals, in the scoring.  In the Rugby rules of the time, a try only provided the attempt to kick a free goal from the field.  If the kick was missed, the try did not score any points itself.\n\n====Harvard\u2013Tufts, Harvard\u2013Yale (1875)====\nHarvard quickly took a liking to the rugby game, and its use of the [[try]] which, until that time, was not used in American football. The try would later evolve into the score known as the [[touchdown]]. On June 4, 1875, Harvard faced [[Tufts University]] in the first game between two American colleges played under rules similar to the McGill/Harvard contest, which was won by Tufts.<ref>Gardner (1996)</ref> The rules included each side fielding 11 men at any given time, the ball was advanced by kicking or carrying it, and tackles of the ball carrier stopped play - - actions of which have carried over to the modern version of football played today <ref>{{cite web |title=Gridiron gridlock: Citing research, Tufts claims football history is on its side |first=Kevin Paul |last=Dupont |date=September 23, 2004 |work=The Boston Globe |url=http://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2004/09/23/gridiron_gridlock/?page=full}}</ref>\n\nHarvard later challenged its closest rival, Yale, to which the Bulldogs accepted. The two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. They decided to play with 15 players on each team. On November 13, 1875, Yale and Harvard played each other for the first time ever, where Harvard won 4-0. At the first [[The Game (Harvard\u2013Yale)|The Game]] (as the annual contest between Harvard and Yale came to be named) the future \"father of American football\" [[Walter Camp]] was among the 2000 spectators in attendance. Walter, who would enroll at Yale the next year, was torn between an admiration for Harvard's style of play and the misery of the Yale defeat, and became determined to avenge Yale's defeat. Spectators from Princeton also carried the game back home, where it quickly became the most popular version of football.<ref name=PFRA1/>\n\nOn November 23, 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit House in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] to standardize a new code of rules based on the rugby game first introduced to Harvard by McGill University in 1874. Three of the schools\u2014Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton\u2014formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, as a result of the meeting. Yale initially refused to join this association because of a disagreement over the number of players to be allowed per team (relenting in 1879) and Rutgers were not invited to the meeting. The rules that they agreed upon were essentially those of rugby union at the time with the exception that points be awarded for scoring a [[try]], not just the [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] afterwards ([[Conversion (gridiron football)|extra point]]). Incidentally, rugby was to make a similar change to its scoring system 10 years later.<ref name=PFRA2>{{cite web|title=Camp and His Followers: American Football 1876\u20131889 |work=The Journey to Camp: The Origins of American Football to 1889 |publisher=Professional Football Researchers Association |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf |accessdate=2010-01-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5qRx5vacY?url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-13 |df= }}</ref>\n[[File:Walter Camp - Project Gutenberg eText 18048.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Walter Camp]], the \"Father of American Football\", pictured here in 1878 as the captain of the Yale Football team]]\n\n====Walter Camp: Father of American football====\n[[Walter Camp]] is widely considered to be the most important figure in the development of American football.<ref name=\"histfoot\"/><ref name=\"NFL1869\"/><ref name=PFRA2/> As a youth, he excelled in sports like [[Track and field athletics|track]], baseball, and association football, and after enrolling at [[Yale]] in 1876, he earned varsity honors in every sport the school offered.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nFollowing the introduction of rugby-style rules to American football, Camp became a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where rules were debated and changed. Dissatisfied with what seemed to him to be a disorganized mob, he proposed his first rule change at the first meeting he attended in 1878: a reduction from fifteen players to eleven. The motion was rejected at that time but passed in 1880. The effect was to open up the game and emphasize speed over strength. Camp's most famous change, the establishment of the [[line of scrimmage]] and the [[Snap (football)|snap]] from [[center (American football)|center]] to [[quarterback]], was also passed in 1880. Originally, the snap was executed with the foot of the center. Later changes made it possible to snap the ball with the hands, either through the air or by a direct hand-to-hand pass.<ref name=PFRA2/>  [[Rugby league]] followed Camp's example, and in 1906 introduced the [[play-the-ball]] rule, which greatly resembled Camp's early scrimmage and center-snap rules.  In 1966, rugby league introduced a four-tackle rule (changed in 1972 to a six-tackle rule) based on Camp's early down-and-distance rules.\n\nCamp's new scrimmage rules revolutionized the game, though not always as intended. Princeton, in particular, used scrimmage play to slow the game, making incremental progress towards the end zone during each [[Down (gridiron football)|down]]. Rather than increase scoring, which had been Camp's original intent, the rule was exploited to maintain control of the ball for the entire game, resulting in slow, unexciting contests. At the 1882 rules meeting, Camp proposed that a team be required to advance the ball a minimum of five yards within three downs. These down-and-distance rules, combined with the establishment of the line of scrimmage, transformed the game from a variation of rugby football into the distinct sport of American football.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nCamp was central to several more significant rule changes that came to define American football. In 1881, the field was reduced in size to its modern dimensions of 120 by 53{{fraction|1|3}} yards (109.7 by 48.8 meters). Several times in 1883, Camp tinkered with the scoring rules, finally arriving at four points for a touchdown, two points for [[Extra point|kicks after touchdowns]], two points for safeties, and five for [[Field goal (football)|field goals]].  Camp's innovations in the area of point scoring influenced rugby union's move to point scoring in 1890.  In 1887, game time was set at two halves of 45 minutes each. Also in 1887, two paid officials\u2014a [[Referee (American football)|referee]] and an [[Official (American football)#Umpire|umpire]]\u2014were mandated for each game. A year later, the rules were changed to allow tackling below the waist, and in 1889, the officials were given whistles and stopwatches.<ref name=PFRA2/>\n\nAfter leaving Yale in 1882, Camp was employed by the New Haven Clock Company until his death in 1925. Though no longer a player, he remained a fixture at annual rules meetings for most of his life, and he personally selected an annual [[All-America|All-American team]] every year from 1889 through 1924. The [[Walter Camp Football Foundation]] continues to select All-American teams in his honor.<ref name=camp>{{cite web|title=The History of Walter Camp |publisher=The Walter Camp Foundation |url=http://waltercamp.org/index.php/info/ |accessdate=2008-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218214118/http://waltercamp.org/index.php/info/ |archivedate=2007-12-18 |df= }}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Scoring table===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+Historical college football scoring<ref>A compilation of seven sources:\n* \"[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/bay/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/09-ma-section05.pdf History.]\" ''2009 Baylor Football Media Almanac''.

However, after a few years, the school began to feel the isolation of its newly adopted sport, which was not spreading as many had hoped. Students and alumni began to clamor for a return to American football to allow wider intercollegiate competition.<ref name=park/> The pressure at rival California was stronger (especially as the school had not been as successful in the Big Game as they had hoped), and in 1915 California returned to American football. As reasons for the change, the school cited rule change back to American football, the overwhelming desire of students and supporters to play American football, interest in playing other East Coast and Midwest schools, and a patriotic desire to play an \"American\" game.<ref name=park/> California's return to American football increased the pressure on Stanford to also change back in order to maintain the rivalry. Stanford played its 1915, 1916, and 1917 \"Big Games\" as rugby union against [[Santa Clara Broncos|Santa Clara]] and California's football \"Big Game\" in those years was against [[Washington Huskies football|Washington]], but both schools desired to restore the old traditions.<ref name=park/> The onset of American involvement in World War I gave Stanford an out: In 1918, the Stanford campus was designated as the Students' Army Training Corps headquarters for all of [[California]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]], and the commanding officer Sam M.

[[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] found much success in its early years, winning eight Colorado Football Association Championships (1894\u201397, 1901\u201308).\n\nThe following was taken from the ''Silver & Gold'' newspaper of December 16, 1898. It was a recollection of the birth of Colorado football written by one of CU's original gridders, John C. Nixon, also the school's second captain. It appears here in its original form:\n\n{{quote|At the beginning of the first semester in the fall of '90 the boys rooming at the dormitory on the campus of the U. of C. being afflicted with a super-abundance of penned up energy, or perhaps having recently drifted from under the parental wing and delighting in their newly found freedom, decided among other wild schemes, to form an athletic association. Messrs Carney, Whittaker, Layton and others, who at that time constituted a majority of the male population of the University, called a meeting of the campus boys in the old medical building. Nixon was elected president and Holden secretary of the association.\n\nIt was voted that the officers constitute a committee to provide uniform suits in which to play what was called \"association football\". Suits of flannel were ultimately procured and paid for assessments on the members of the association and generous contributions from members of the faculty.&nbsp;...\n\nThe Athletic Association should now invigorate its base-ball and place it at par with its football team; and it certainly has the material with which to do it. The U of C should henceforth lead the state and possibly the west in athletic sports.&nbsp;...\n\nThe style of football playing has altered considerably; by the old rules, all men in front of the runner with the ball, were offside, consequently we could not send backs through and break the line ahead of the ball as is done at present. The notorious V was then in vogue, which gave a heavy team too much advantage. The mass plays being now barred, skill on the football field is more in demand than mere weight and strength.\n\n|author=John C.

The [[University of Denver]] and the [[University of Utah]] joined the RMAC in 1910. For its first thirty years, the RMAC was considered a major conference equivalent to today's Division I, before 7 larger members left and formed the [[Mountain States Conference]] (also called the Skyline Conference).\n\n===Violence, formation of NCAA===\nCollege football increased in popularity through the remainder of the 19th and early 20th century. It also became increasingly violent. Between 1890 and 1905, 330 college athletes died as a direct result of injuries sustained on the football field. These deaths could be attributed to the mass formations and gang tackling that characterized the sport in its early years.\n\n{{Quote box|quote=No sport is wholesome in which ungenerous or mean acts which easily escape detection contribute to victory.|source=[[Charles William Eliot]], President of [[Harvard University]] (1869\u20131909) opposing football in 1905.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kf9KAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&resnum=3&ved=0CBgQ6AEwAg&q=%22no%20sport%20is%20wholesome%20in%20which%20ungenerous%20or%20mean%20acts%20which%20easily%20escape%20detection%20contribute%20to%20victory%22 \"President Eliot on Football.\"] ''The School Journal, Volume 70'', United Education Company, New York, Chicago, and Boston, February 18, 1905, p.188.</ref>|width = 30%}}\n\nThe 1894 Harvard\u2013Yale game, known as the \"Hampden Park Blood Bath\", resulted in crippling injuries for four players; the contest was suspended until 1897.

What is absolutely certain is that on October 9, 1905, Roosevelt held a meeting of football representatives from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], and [[Princeton University|Princeton]]. Though he lectured on eliminating and reducing injuries, he never threatened to ban football. He also lacked the authority to abolish football and was, in fact, actually a fan of the sport and wanted to preserve it.

Because the college officials could not agree upon a change in rules, it was decided over the course of several subsequent meetings that an external governing body should be responsible. Finally, on December 28, 1905, 62 schools met in New York City to discuss rule changes to make the game safer. As a result of this meeting, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States was formed in 1906.  The IAAUS was the original rule making body of college football, but would go on to sponsor championships in other sports.

The rules committee legalized the [[forward pass]] instead. Though it was underutilized for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 18</ref> Another rule change banned \"mass momentum\" plays (many of which, like the infamous \"flying wedge\", were sometimes literally deadly).\n\n===Modernization and innovation (1906\u20131930)===\n[[File:RobinsonThrowing.jpg|thumb|1906 ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' photograph of [[Bradbury Robinson|Brad Robinson]], who threw the first legal forward pass and was the sport's first [[Triple threat man|triple threat]]]]\nAs a result of the 1905\u20131906 reforms, mass formation plays became illegal and [[forward pass]]es legal. [[Bradbury Robinson]], playing for visionary coach [[Eddie Cochems]] at [[Saint Louis University]], threw the first legal pass in a September 5, 1906, game against [[Carroll University|Carroll College]] at [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]]. Other important changes, formally adopted in 1910, were the requirements that at least seven offensive players be on the line of scrimmage at the time of the snap, that there be no pushing or pulling, and that interlocking interference (arms linked or hands on belts and uniforms) was not allowed. These changes greatly reduced the potential for collision injuries.<ref>John S.

In 1914, the first roughing-the-passer penalty was implemented. In 1918, the rules on eligible receivers were loosened to allow eligible players to catch the ball anywhere on the field\u2014previously strict rules were in place allowing passes to only certain areas of the field.<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 22</ref>  Scoring rules also changed during this time: field goals were lowered to three points in 1909<ref name=\"NFL1869\"/> and touchdowns raised to six points in 1912.<ref name=NFL1911>{{cite web | title = NFL History 1911\u20131920 | work=NFL.com | year = 2007 | url = http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920 | accessdate =2007-05-15}}</ref>\n\nStar players that emerged in the early 20th century include [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Red Grange]], and [[Bronko Nagurski]]; these three made the transition to the fledgling NFL and helped turn it into a successful league.

As part of his single and double wing formations, Warner was one of the first coaches to effectively utilize the forward pass.

When Army scheduled Notre Dame as a warm-up game, they thought little of the small school. Rockne and quarterback [[Gus Dorais]] made innovative use of the forward pass, still at that point a relatively unused weapon, to defeat Army 35\u201313 and helped establish the school as a national power. Rockne returned to coach the team in 1918, and devised the powerful [[Notre Dame Box]] offense, based on Warner's single wing. He is credited with being the first major coach to emphasize offense over defense. Rockne is also credited with popularizing and perfecting the forward pass, a seldom used play at the time.<ref name=rockne>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Knute Rockne |work=MSN Encarta |year=2007 |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576926/Knute_Rockne.html |accessdate=2008-04-06 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwqfK5YJ?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761576926/Knute_Rockne.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> The [[1924 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|1924 team]] featured the [[Four Horsemen (American football)|Four Horsemen]] backfield. In 1927, his complex shifts led directly to a rule change whereby all offensive players had to stop for a full second before the ball could be snapped. Rather than simply a regional team, Rockne's \"Fighting Irish\" became famous for [[Barnstorm (athletics)|barnstorming]] and played any team at any location. It was during Rockne's tenure that the annual [[Jeweled Shillelagh|Notre Dame-University of Southern California rivalry]] began. He led his team to an impressive 105\u201312\u20135 record before his premature death in a [[1931 Transcontinental & Western Air Fokker F-10 crash|plane crash]] in 1931.

Although before the mid-1920s most national powers came from the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] or the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], the trend changed when several teams from the South and the West Coast achieved national success. [[Wallace William Wade]]'s [[1925 Alabama Crimson Tide football team#1925|1925 Alabama]] team won the [[1926 Rose Bowl]] after receiving its first national title and [[William Alexander (coach)|William Alexander]]'s 1928 [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] team defeated [[California Golden Bears football|California]] in the [[1929 Rose Bowl]]. College football quickly became the most popular spectator sport in the South.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 24\u201329</ref>\n\nSeveral major modern college football conferences rose to prominence during this time period. The [[Southwest Athletic Conference]] had been founded in 1915. Consisting mostly of schools from Texas, the conference saw back-to-back national champions with [[TCU Horned Frogs football|Texas Christian University]] (TCU) in 1938 and [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] in 1939.<ref name=1930s>MacCambridge (1999), pp 124</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Look Back at the Southwest Conference | work = 2006\u20132007 Texas Almanac | publisher = The Dallas Morning News | year = 2007 | url = https://texasalmanac.com/topics/sports/look-back-southwest-conference | accessdate = 2018-07-04 }}</ref>  The [[Pacific Coast Conference]] (PCC), a precursor to the [[Pac-12 Conference]] (Pac-12), had its own back-to-back champion in the [[USC Trojans football|University of Southern California]] which was awarded the title in 1931 and 1932.<ref name=1930s/> The [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) formed in 1932 and consisted mostly of schools in the [[Deep South]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Ours |first=Robert M. |title=Southeastern Conference |work=College Football Encyclopedia |publisher=Augusta Computer Services |year=2007 |url=http://www.footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm |accessdate=2007-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510232409/http://footballencyclopedia.com/sechome.htm |archivedate=2007-05-10 |df= }}</ref>  As in previous decades, the Big Ten continued to dominate in the 1930s and 1940s, with Minnesota winning 5 titles between 1934 and 1941, and Michigan (1933, 1947, and 1948) and [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] (1942) also winning titles.<ref name=1930s/><ref name=1940s>MacCambridge (1999), pp 148</ref>\n[[File:Hutson-Don-1940-grainfix.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Don Hutson in 1940.]]\nAs it grew beyond its regional affiliations in the 1930s, college football garnered increased national attention. Four new [[bowl game]]s were created: the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]], [[Sugar Bowl]], the [[Sun Bowl]] in 1935, and the [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton Bowl]] in 1937. In lieu of an actual national championship, these bowl games, along with the earlier Rose Bowl, provided a way to match up teams from distant regions of the country that did not otherwise play. In 1936, the [[Associated Press]] began its [[AP Poll|weekly poll]] of prominent sports writers, ranking all of the nation's college football teams. Since there was no national championship game, the final version of the AP poll was used to determine who \nwas crowned the [[Mythical National Championship|National Champion]] of college football.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 30</ref>\n\nThe 1930s saw growth in the passing game. Though some coaches, such as General [[Robert Neyland]] at Tennessee, continued to eschew its use, several rules changes to the game had a profound effect on teams' ability to throw the ball. In 1934, the rules committee removed two major penalties\u2014a loss of five yards for a second incomplete pass in any series of downs and a loss of possession for an incomplete pass in the end zone\u2014and shrunk the circumference of the ball, making it easier to grip and throw. Players who became famous for taking advantage of the easier passing game included Alabama end [[Don Hutson]] and TCU passer [[Sammy Baugh|\"Slingin\" Sammy Baugh]].<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 28\u201330</ref>\n\nIn 1935, New York City's [[Downtown Athletic Club]] awarded the first [[Heisman Trophy]] to [[Chicago Maroons football|University of Chicago]] halfback [[Jay Berwanger]], who was also the first ever [[NFL Draft]] pick in 1936. The trophy was designed by sculptor [[Frank Eliscu]] and modeled after [[NYU Violets|New York University]] player [[Ed Smith (football player)|Ed Smith]].

[[Doc Blanchard]] (known as \"Mr. Inside\") and [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glenn Davis]] (known as \"Mr. Outside\") both won the [[Heisman Trophy]], in 1945 and 1946.

[[Oklahoma Sooners football|Oklahoma]], under coach [[Bud Wilkinson]], won three national titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten [[Big Eight Conference]] championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. [[Woody Hayes]] led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and won three [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten titles]].  The [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State Spartans]] were known as the \"football factory\" during the 1950s, where coaches [[Clarence Munn]] and [[Duffy Daugherty]] led the Spartans to two national titles and two [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten titles]] after joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] athletically in 1953.  Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival of the running game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped from an average of 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman Trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. [[Paul Hornung]], Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 41\u201345</ref><ref name=1950s>MacCambridge (1999) pp 172</ref>\n\n===Modern college football (since 1958)===\nFollowing the enormous  success of the [[1958 NFL Championship Game]], college football no longer enjoyed the same popularity as the NFL, at least on a national level.

In the 1950s, Notre Dame, which had a large national following, formed its own network to broadcast its games, but by and large the sport still retained a mostly regional following. In 1952, the NCAA claimed all television broadcasting rights for the games of its member institutions, and it alone negotiated television rights. This situation continued until 1984, when several schools brought a suit under the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]]; the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma|ruled against the NCAA]] and schools are now free to negotiate their own television deals. [[ABC Sports]] began broadcasting a national Game of the Week in 1966, bringing key matchups and rivalries to a national audience for the first time.<ref>Vancil (2000) pp 46\u201348</ref>\n\nNew formations and play sets continued to be developed. [[Emory Bellard]], an assistant coach under [[Darrell Royal]] at the [[Texas Longhorns football|University of Texas]], developed a three-back [[option offense|option]] style offense known as the [[wishbone formation|wishbone]]. The wishbone is a run-heavy offense that depends on the quarterback making last second decisions on when and to whom to hand or pitch the ball to. Royal went on to teach the offense to other coaches, including [[Bear Bryant]] at Alabama, [[Chuck Fairbanks]] at Oklahoma and [[Pepper Rodgers]] at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA]]; who all adapted and developed it to their own tastes.<ref>Vancil (2000), pp 56</ref>  The strategic opposite of the wishbone is the [[spread offense]], developed by professional and college coaches throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Though some schools play a run-based version of the spread, its most common use is as a passing offense designed to \"spread\" the field both horizontally and vertically.<ref name=formations>Bennett (1976), Appendix pp 209\u2013217</ref>  Some teams have managed to adapt with the times to keep winning consistently.

At the birth of cable television and cable sports networks like [[ESPN]], there were fifteen bowls in 1980. With more national venues and increased available revenue, the bowls saw an explosive growth throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In the thirty years from 1950 to 1980, seven bowl games were added to the schedule.

As conferences became contractually bound to certain bowl games (a situation known as a [[Automatic bids to non-BCS bowls|tie-in]]), match-ups that guaranteed a consensus national champion became increasingly rare. In 1992, seven conferences and independent Notre Dame formed the [[Bowl Coalition]], which attempted to arrange an annual No.1 versus No.2 matchup based on the final AP poll standings. The Coalition lasted for three years; however, several scheduling issues prevented much success; tie-ins still took precedence in several cases. For example, the Big Eight and SEC champions could never meet, since they were contractually bound to different bowl games. The coalition also excluded the Rose Bowl, arguably the most prestigious game in the nation, and two major conferences\u2014the Pac-10 and Big Ten\u2014meaning that it had limited success. In 1995, the Coalition was replaced by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which reduced the number of bowl games to host a national championship game to three\u2014the [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]], Sugar, and Orange Bowls\u2014and the participating conferences to five\u2014the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]], [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]], [[Southwest Conference|Southwest]], [[Big Eight Conference|Big Eight]], and [[Big East Conference (1979\u20132013)|Big East]]. It was agreed that the No.1 and No.2 ranked teams gave up their prior bowl tie-ins and were guaranteed to meet in the national championship game, which rotated between the three participating bowls. The system still did not include the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]], [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-10]], or the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], and thus still lacked the legitimacy of a true national championship.<ref name=hickok1/><ref name=BCS>{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology | publisher=FOX Sports on MSN | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate =2007-06-01|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070915010233/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history |archivedate = September 15, 2007|deadurl=yes}}</ref> However, one positive side effect is that if there were three teams at the end of the season vying for a national title, but one of them was a [[Pac-10]]/[[Big Ten]] team bound to the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]], then there would be no difficulty in deciding which teams to place in the Bowl Alliance \"national championship\" bowl; if the [[Pac-10]] / [[Big Ten]] team won the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] and finished with the same record as whichever team won the other bowl game, they could have a share of the national title. This happened in the final year of the Bowl Alliance, with [[1997 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] winning the [[1998 Rose Bowl]] and [[1997 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] winning the [[1998 Orange Bowl]]. Without the [[Pac-10]]/[[Big Ten]] team bound to a bowl game, it would be difficult to decide which two teams should play for the national title.\n\n====Bowl Championship Series====\n{{main|Bowl Championship Series}}\n{{see also|NCAA Division I Football Championship}}\n\n[[File:The 2013 College Football National Championship Trophy display at the Moore Athletic Center.jpg|thumb|right|The BCS National Championship trophy on display at [[Florida State University]]. The 2013 Championship game marked the end of the BCS era.]]\nIn 1998, a new system was put into place called the Bowl Championship Series. For the first time, it included all major conferences (ACC, Big East, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-10, and SEC) and four major bowl games (Rose, Orange, Sugar and Fiesta). The champions of these six conferences, along with two \"at-large\" selections, were invited to play in the four bowl games. Each year, one of the four bowl games served as a national championship game. Also, a complex system of human polls, computer rankings, and strength of schedule calculations was instituted to rank schools. Based on this ranking system, the No.1 and No.2 teams met each year in the national championship game. Traditional tie-ins were maintained for schools and bowls not part of the national championship. For example, in years when not a part of the national championship, the Rose Bowl still hosted the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions.<ref name=BCS/>\n\nThe system continued to change, as the formula for ranking teams was tweaked from year to year. At-large teams could be chosen from any of the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I-A]] conferences, though only one selection\u2014[[2004 Utah Utes football team|Utah]] in 2005\u2014came from a BCS non-AQ conference. Starting with the 2006 season, a fifth game\u2014simply called the [[BCS National Championship Game]]\u2014was added to the schedule, to be played at the site of one of the four BCS bowl games on a rotating basis, one week after the regular bowl game. This opened up the BCS to two additional at-large teams. Also, rules were changed to add the champions of five additional conferences ([[Conference USA]] [C-USA], the [[Mid-American Conference]] [MAC], the [[Mountain West Conference]] [MW], the [[Sun Belt Conference]] and the [[Western Athletic Conference]] [WAC]), provided that said champion ranked in the top twelve in the final BCS rankings, or was within the top 16 of the BCS rankings and ranked higher than the champion of at least one of the [[Power Five conferences|BCS Automatic Qualifying (AQ) conferences]].<ref name=BCS/> Several times since this rule change was implemented, schools from non-AQ conferences have played in BCS bowl games. In 2009, [[2009 Boise State Broncos football team|Boise State]] played [[2009 TCU Horned Frogs football team|TCU]] in the [[2010 Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta Bowl]], the first time two schools from non-AQ conferences played each other in a BCS bowl game. The last team from the non-AQ ranks to reach a BCS bowl game in the BCS era was [[2012 Northern Illinois Huskies football team|Northern Illinois in 2012]], which played in (and lost) the [[2013 Orange Bowl]].\n\n====College Football Playoff====\n{{main|College Football Playoff}}\n\nThe longtime resistance to a playoff system at the FBS level finally ended with the creation of the College Football Playoff (CFP) beginning with the 2014 season. The CFP is a [[Plus-One system]], a concept that became popular as a BCS alternative following controversies in 2003 and 2004. The CFP is a four-team tournament whose participants are chosen and seeded by a 13-member selection committee. The semifinals are hosted by two of a group of six traditional bowl games often called the \"New Year's Six\", with semifinal hosting rotating annually among three pairs of games in the following order: Rose/Sugar, Orange/Cotton, and Fiesta/Peach. The two semifinal winners then advance to the [[College Football Playoff National Championship]], whose host is determined by open bidding several years in advance.\n\nThe establishment of the CFP followed [[2010\u20132014 NCAA conference realignment|a tumultuous period of conference realignment]] in Division I. The WAC, after seeing [[2010\u201313 Western Athletic Conference realignment|all but two of its football members leave]], dropped football after the 2012 season. The Big East [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment|split into two leagues in 2013]]; the schools that did not play FBS football reorganized as a new non-football [[Big East Conference]], while the FBS member schools that remained in the original structure joined with several new members and became the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The American retained the Big East's automatic BCS bowl bid for the 2013 season, but lost this status in the CFP era.\n\nThe 10 FBS conferences are formally and popularly divided into two groups:\n* [[Power Five conferences|Power Five]] \u2013 Five of the six AQ conferences of the BCS era, specifically the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12, and SEC. Each champion of these conferences is assured of a spot in a New Year's Six bowl, though not necessarily in a semifinal game. [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] remains a football independent, but is counted among the Power Five because of its full but non-football ACC membership, including a football scheduling alliance with that conference. It has its own arrangement for access to the New Year's Six games should it meet certain standards.\n* Group of Five \u2013 The remaining five FBS conferences \u2013 American, C-USA, MAC, MW, and Sun Belt. The other five current FBS independents, [[Army Black Knights football|Army]], [[BYU Cougars football|BYU]], [[Liberty Flames football|Liberty]], [[UMass Minutemen football|Massachusetts]], and [[New Mexico State Aggies football|New Mexico State]], are also considered to be part of this group. One conference champion from this group receives a spot in a New Year's Six game. In the first four seasons of the CFP, the Group of Five has yet to place a team in a semifinal. Of the four Group of Five teams selected for New Year's Six bowls, three have won their games.\n\n==Official rules and notable rule distinctions==\n{{see also|American football rules}}\n\n[[File:harvard crimsons v brown 2009.JPG|thumb|A [[night game]] between Harvard and Brown, September 25, 2009]]\nAlthough rules for the high school, college, and NFL games are generally consistent, there are several minor differences. The NCAA Football Rules Committee determines the playing rules for Division I (both Bowl and Championship Subdivisions), II, and III games (the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] (NAIA) is a separate organization, but uses the NCAA rules).\n\n* A pass is ruled complete if one of the receiver's feet is inbounds at the time of the catch. In the NFL both feet must be inbounds.\n* A player is considered down when any part of his body other than the feet or hands touches the ground or when the ball carrier is tackled or otherwise falls and loses possession of the ball as he contacts the ground with any part of his body, with the sole exception of the holder for field goal and extra point attempts. In the NFL a player is active until he is tackled or forced down by a member of the opposing team (down by contact).\n* The clock stops after the offense completes a first down and begins again\u2014assuming it is following a play in which the clock would not normally stop\u2014once the referee says the ball is ready for play. In the NFL the clock does not explicitly stop for a first down.\n* Overtime was introduced in 1996, eliminating most ties except in the regular season. When a game goes to overtime, each team is given one possession from its opponent's twenty-five yard line with no game clock, despite the one timeout per period and use of play clock. The team leading after both possessions is declared the winner. If the teams remain tied, overtime periods continue, with a coin flip determining the first possession. Possessions alternate with each overtime, until one team leads the other at the end of the overtime. Starting with the third overtime, a one-point PAT field goal after a touchdown is no longer allowed, forcing teams to attempt a two-point conversion after a touchdown. (In the NFL overtime is decided by a [[Overtime (sports)#American and Canadian football|modified sudden-death period]] of 10 minutes in preseason and regular-season games and 15 minutes in playoff games, and regular-season games can still end in a tie if neither team scores. Overtime for regular-season games in the [[National Football League|NFL]] began with the [[1974 NFL season|1974]] season; the overtime period for all games was 15 minutes until it was shortened for non-playoff games effective in {{nfly|2017}}. In the postseason, if the teams are still tied, teams will play additional overtime periods until either team scores.)\n** A tie game is still possible, per NCAA Rule 3-3-3 (c) and (d).  If a game is suspended because of inclement weather while tied, typically in the second half or at the end of regulation, and the game is unable to be continued, the game ends in a tie.  Similar to baseball, if one team has scored in its possession and the other team has not completed its possession, the score during the overtime can be wiped out and the game ruled a tie.\n* [[Try (American Football)|Extra point tries]] are attempted from the three-yard line. Kicked tries count as one point. Teams can also go for \"the [[two-point conversion]]\" which is when a team will line up at the three-yard line and try to score. If they are successful, they receive two points, if they are not, then they receive zero points. Starting with the 2015 season, the NFL uses the 15-yard line as the line of scrimmage for placekick attempts, but the two-yard line for two-point attempts. The two-point conversion was not implemented in the NFL until 1994, but it had been previously used in the old American Football League (AFL) before it merged with the NFL in 1970.\n* The defensive team may score two points on a point-after touchdown attempt by returning a blocked kick, fumble, or interception into the opposition's end zone. In addition, if the defensive team gains possession, but then moves backwards into the end zone and is stopped, a one-point safety will be awarded to the offense, although, unlike a real safety, the offense kicks off, opposed to the team charged with the safety. This college rule was added in 1988. The NFL, which previously treated the ball as dead during a conversion attempt\u2014meaning that the attempt ended when the defending team gained possession of the football\u2014adopted the college rule in 2015.\n* The [[two-minute warning]] is not used in college football, except in rare cases where the scoreboard clock has malfunctioned and is not being used.\n* There is an option to use instant replay review of officiating decisions. Division I FBS schools use replay in virtually all games; replay is rarely used in lower division games. Every play is subject to booth review with coaches only having one challenge. In the NFL, only scoring plays, turnovers, the final 2:00 of each half and all overtime periods are reviewed, and coaches are issued two challenges (with the option for a 3rd if the first two are successful).\n* Starting in the 2012 season, the ball is placed on the 25-yard line following a touchback on a kickoff. At all other levels of football, plus all other touchback situations under NCAA rules, the ball is placed on the 20.\n* Among other rule changes in 2007, kickoffs were moved from the 35-yard line back five yards to the 30-yard line, matching a change that the NFL had made in 1994. Some coaches and officials questioned this rule change as it could lead to more injuries to the players as there will likely be more kickoff returns.<ref>{{cite news | title=Kickoffs from 30 yard line could create more returns, injuries | url=https://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/news?slug=ap-ncaa-rules&prov=ap&type=lgns | agency=Associated Press | date=April 16, 2007 | accessdate=2007-08-17}}</ref> The rationale for the rule change was to help reduce dead time in the game.<ref>{{cite web | title=NCAA Football Rules Committee Votes To Restore Plays While Attempting To Maintain Shorter Overall Game Time | url=http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2007/february/20070214_football_cmtee_rls.html | publisher=NCAA | date=2007-02-14 | accessdate=2007-08-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930210117/http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2007/february/20070214_football_cmtee_rls.html | archivedate=2007-09-30 | df= }}</ref> The NFL returned its kickoff location to the 35-yard line effective in 2011; college football did not do so until 2012.\n* Several changes were made to college rules in 2011, all of which differ from NFL practice:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=6361845 |title=Series of rules changes approved |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=April 15, 2011 |accessdate=June 11, 2011}}</ref>\n** If a player is penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct for actions that occurred during a play ending in a touchdown by that team, but before the goal line was crossed, the touchdown will be nullified. In the NFL, the same foul would result in a penalty on the conversion attempt or ensuing kickoff, at the option of the non-penalized team.\n** If a team is penalized in the final minute of a half and the penalty causes the clock to stop, the opposing team now has the right to have 10&nbsp;seconds run off the clock in addition to the yardage penalty. The NFL has a similar rule in the final minute of the half, but it applies only to specified violations against the offensive team. The new NCAA rule applies to penalties on both sides of the ball.\n** Players lined up outside the tackle box\u2014more specifically, those lined up more than 7&nbsp;yards from the center\u2014will now be allowed to block below the waist only if they are blocking straight ahead or toward the nearest sideline.\n** On placekicks, no offensive lineman can now be engaged by more than two defensive players. A violation will be a 5-yard penalty.\n\n==Organization==\nCollege teams mostly play other similarly sized schools through the NCAA's divisional system. [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] generally consists of the major collegiate athletic powers with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and (with the exception of a few conferences such as the [[Pioneer Football League]]) more athletic scholarships. [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] primarily consists of smaller public and private institutions that offer fewer scholarships than those in Division I. [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] institutions also field teams, but do not offer any scholarships.\n\nFootball teams in Division I are further divided into the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]] (consisting of the largest programs) and the [[NCAA Football Championship Subdivision|Championship Subdivision]]. The Bowl Subdivision has historically not used an organized tournament to determine its champion, and instead teams compete in post-season [[list of college bowl games|bowl games]]. That changed with the debut of the four-team [[College Football Playoff]] at the end of the 2014 season.\n\nTeams in each of these four divisions are further divided into various regional conferences.\n\nSeveral organizations operate college football programs outside the jurisdiction of the NCAA:\n\n* The [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] has jurisdiction over more than 80 college football teams, mostly in the midwest.\n* The [[National Junior College Athletic Association]] has jurisdiction over two-year institutions. (California's two-year institutions are not under NJCAA jurisdiction and only compete for state championships.)\n* [[Club football]], a sport in which student [[sports club|clubs]] run the teams instead of the colleges themselves, is overseen by two organizations: the [[National Club Football Association]] and the Intercollegiate Club Football Federation. The two competing sanctioning bodies have some overlap, and several clubs are members of both organizations.\n* The [[Sprint football|Collegiate Sprint Football League]] governs nine teams, all in the northeast. Its primary restriction is that all players must weigh less than the average college student (that threshold is set, {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, at 172 pounds/78&nbsp;kg).\n\nA college that fields a team in the NCAA is not restricted from fielding teams in club or sprint football, and several colleges field two teams, a varsity (NCAA) squad and a club or sprint squad (no schools, {{as of|2015|lc=y}}, field both club ''and'' sprint teams at the same time).\n\n==Coaching==\n{{main|Head coach#College football}}\n\n==National championships==\n* [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS]] \u2013 Overview of systems for determining national champions at the highest level of college football from 1869 to present.\n** [[College Football Playoff]] \u2013 4 team playoff system for determining national champions at the highest level of college football beginning in 2014.\n** [[Bowl Championship Series]] \u2013 The primary method of determining the national champion at the highest level of college football from 1998\u20132013; preceded by the [[Bowl Alliance]] (1995\u20131997) and the [[Bowl Coalition]] (1992\u20131994).\n* [[NCAA Division I Football Championship]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.div1fbchampionship.com/|title=NCAA Division I Football Championship|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref> \u2013 playoff for determining the national champion at the second highest level of college football, [[Division I FCS]], from 1978 to present.\n** [[NCAA Division I FCS Consensus Mid-Major Football National Championship]] \u2013 awarded by poll from 2001- to 2007 for a subset of the second highest level of play in college football, FCS.\n* [[NCAA Division II Football Championship]] \u2013 playoff for determining the national champion at the third highest level of college football from 1973 to present.\n* [[NCAA Division III Football Championship]] \u2013 playoff for determining the national champion at the fourth highest level of college football from 1973 to present.\n* [[NAIA Football National Championship|NAIA National Football Championship]] -playoff for determining the national champions of college football governed by the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]].\n* [[NJCAA National Football Championship]] \u2013 playoff for determining the national champions of college football governed by the [[National Junior College Athletic Association]].\n* [[List of Collegiate Sprint Football League champions|CSFL Championship]] \u2013 Champions of the [[Collegiate Sprint Football League]], a weight restricted football sport.\n\n==Team maps==\n<gallery>\nFile:2015 NCAA FBS Football Programs.png|Map of Division I (A) FBS\nFile:FCS map 2011.png|Map of Division I (AA) FCS\nFile:NCAA D2 FB Map.png|Map of NCAA Division II\nFile:NCAA Division 3 football map 2014.gif|Map of NCAA Division III\nFile:Map of National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics schools playing college football.png|Map of NAIA\nFile:NJCAA fb.png|Map of NJCAA\nFile:CCCAA fb.png|Map of CCCAA\n</gallery>\n\n==Playoff games==\nStarted in the 2014 season, four [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] teams are selected at the end of regular season to compete in a playoff for the FBS national championship. The inaugural champion was [[2014 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.com/history/football/fbs|title=FBS College Football History|work=NCAA.com|accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref> The [[College Football Playoff]] replaced the [[Bowl Championship Series]], which had been used as the selection method to determine the national championship game participants since in the 1998 season.\n\nAt the [[NCAA Division I#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I FCS]] level, the teams participate in a 24-team playoff (most recently expanded from 20 teams in 2013) to determine the national championship. Under the current playoff structure, the top eight teams are all seeded, and receive a bye week in the first round. The highest seed receives automatic home field advantage. Starting in 2013, non-seeded teams can only host a playoff game if both teams involved are unseeded; in such a matchup, the schools must bid for the right to host the game. Selection for the playoffs is determined by a selection committee, although usually a team must have an 8-4 record to even be considered. Losses to an FBS team count against their playoff eligibility, while wins against a Division II opponent do not count towards playoff consideration. Thus, only Division I wins (whether FBS, FCS, or FCS non-scholarship) are considered for playoff selection. The Division I National Championship game is held in [[Frisco, Texas]].\n\n[[NCAA Division II|Division II]] and [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] of the NCAA also participate in their own respective playoffs, crowning national champions at the end of the season. The [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]] also holds a playoff.\n\n==Bowl games==\n{{main|Bowl game|List of college bowl games}}\n\nUnlike other college football divisions and most other sports\u2014collegiate or professional\u2014the [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|Football Bowl Subdivision]], formerly known as Division I-A college football, has historically not employed a playoff system to determine a champion. Instead, it has a series of postseason \"bowl games\". The annual National Champion in the Football Bowl Subdivision is then instead traditionally determined by a vote of sports writers and other non-players.\n\nThis system has been challenged often, beginning with an NCAA committee proposal in 1979 to have a four-team playoff following the bowl games.<ref>{{Cite news | last = White| first = Gordon | title = N.C.A.A. Committee Urges Football Playoff | newspaper = The New York Times | date = January 8, 1979 | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60717F93B5D12728DDDA10894D9405B898BF1D3&scp=12&sq=aiaw+tournament&st=p | accessdate = 2011-10-06}}</ref> However, little headway was made in instituting a playoff tournament until 2014, given the entrenched vested economic interests in the various bowls. Although the NCAA publishes lists of claimed FBS-level national champions in its official publications, it has never recognized an official FBS national championship; this policy continues even after the establishment of the [[College Football Playoff]] (which is not directly run by the NCAA) in 2014. As a result, the official Division I National Champion is the winner of the Football Championship Subdivision, as it is the highest level of football with an NCAA-administered championship tournament.\n\nThe first bowl game was the [[1902 Rose Bowl]], played between [[1902 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] and [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]]; Michigan won 49-0. It ended when Stanford requested and Michigan agreed to end it with 8 minutes on the clock. That game was so lopsided that the game was not played annually until 1916, when the Tournament of Roses decided to reattempt the postseason game. The term \"bowl\" originates from the shape of the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl stadium]] in [[Pasadena, California]], which was built in 1923 and resembled the Yale Bowl, built in 1915. This is where the name came into use, as it became known as the [[Rose Bowl Game]]. Other games came along and used the term \"bowl\", whether the stadium was shaped like a bowl or not.\n\nAt the Division I FBS level, teams must earn the right to be [[bowl eligible]] by winning at least 6 games during the season (teams that play 13 games in a season, which is allowed for [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Hawaii]] and any of its home opponents, must win 7 games). They are then invited to a bowl game based on their conference ranking and the tie-ins that the conference has to each bowl game. For the 2009 season, there were 34 bowl games, so 68 of the 120 Division I FBS teams were invited to play at a bowl. These games are played from mid-December to early January and most of the later bowl games are typically considered more prestigious.\n\nAfter the Bowl Championship Series, additional all-star bowl games round out the post-season schedule through the beginning of February.\n\n===Division I FBS National Championship Games===\n{{main|Bowl Championship Series|College Football Playoff}}\n\nPartly as a compromise between both bowl game and playoff supporters, the NCAA created the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS) in 1998 in order to create a definitive national championship game for college football. The series included the four most prominent bowl games (Rose Bowl, Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, Fiesta Bowl), while the national championship game rotated each year between one of these venues. The BCS system was slightly adjusted in 2006, as the NCAA added a fifth game to the series, called the National Championship Game. This allowed the four other BCS bowls to use their normal selection process to select the teams in their games while the top two teams in the BCS rankings would play in the new National Championship Game.\n\nThe BCS selection committee used a complicated, and often controversial, computer system to rank all Division I-FBS teams and the top two teams at the end of the season played for the national championship. This computer system, which factored in newspaper polls, online polls, coaches' polls, strength of schedule, and various other factors of a team's season, led to much dispute over whether the two best teams in the country were being selected to play in the National Championship Game.\n\nThe BCS ended after the 2013 season and, since the 2014 season, the [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|FBS]] national champion has been determined by a four-team tournament known as the [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP). A selection committee of college football experts decides the participating teams. Six major bowl games (the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose]], [[Sugar Bowl|Sugar]], [[Cotton Bowl Classic|Cotton]], [[Orange Bowl|Orange]], [[Peach Bowl|Peach]], and [[Fiesta Bowl|Fiesta]]) rotate on a three-year cycle as semifinal games, with the winners advancing to the [[College Football Playoff National Championship]]. This arrangement is contractually locked in until the 2026 season.\n\n==Controversy==\nCollege football is a controversial institution within American higher education, where the amount of money involved\u2014what people will pay for the entertainment provided\u2014is a corrupting factor within universities that they are usually ill-equipped to deal with.<ref>Steven Salzberg, \"Football is corrupting America's universities: it needs to go\", ''Forbes'', November 26, 2011, https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevensalzberg/2011/11/26/football-is-corrupting-americas-universities-it-needs-to-go/</ref><ref>Jay Schalin, \"Time for universities to punt football\", ''Washington Times'', September 1, 2011, http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/sep/1/time-for-universities-to-punt-football/?page=all</ref> According to William E.

Co-administration of ciprofloxacin with the CYP1A2 substrate tizanidine (Zanaflex) is contraindicated due to a 583% increase in the peak serum concentrations of tizanidine when administered with ciprofloxacin as compared to administration of tizanidine alone.

It is the largest living [[rodent]] in the world. Also called '''chig\u00fcire''', '''chig\u00fciro''' (in Venezuela) and '''carpincho''', it is a member of the genus ''[[Hydrochoerus]]'', of which the only other [[extant taxon|extant]] member is the [[lesser capybara]] (''Hydrochoerus isthmius'').  Its close relatives include [[guinea pig]]s and [[Rock cavy|rock cavies]], and it is more distantly related to the [[agouti]], the [[chinchilla]], and the [[coypu]]. The capybara inhabits [[savanna]]s and dense forests and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in groups of 10\u201320 individuals. The capybara is not a threatened species but it is hunted for its meat and [[Hide (skin)|hide]] and also for grease from its thick fatty [[skin]], which is used in the pharmaceutical trade.<ref>[http://www.arkive.org/capybara/hydrochoerus-hydrochaeris/ Capybara (''Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris'')]. ARKive.org</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIts [[common name]] is derived from [[Tupi language|Tupi]] ''{{lang|tpw|ka'api\u00fbara}}'', a complex agglutination of ''{{lang|tpw|ka\u00e1}}'' (leaf) + ''{{lang|tpw|p\u00edi}}'' (slender) + ''{{lang|tpw|\u00fa}}'' (eat) + ''{{lang|tpw|ara}}'' (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning \"one who eats slender leaves\", or \"grass-eater\".<ref>Ferreira, A. B. H. (1986) ''[[Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa]]'', 2nd ed., Rio de Janeiro: Nova Fronteira, p.344</ref> Capybaras were called several times \"Cuartins\" in Colombia in 2018: in Eje Cafetero (Alcal\u00e0) and near Barranquilla where the meat was offered as \"Cuartin Asado\".\n\nThe [[scientific name]], both ''hydrochoerus'' and ''hydrochaeris'', comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|hydor}}'' \"water\") and {{lang|grc|\u03c7\u03bf\u1fd6\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}} (''{{lang|grc-Latn|choiros}}'' \"pig, hog\").<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Woods|id=13400218|page=1556}}</ref><ref name=\"inDarwin\">{{Cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles R. | authorlink =Charles Darwin| year=1839 | title=Narrative of the surveying voyages of His Majesty's Ships Adventure and Beagle between the years 1826 and 1836, describing their examination of the southern shores of South America, and the Beagle's circumnavigation of the globe.

In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced.<ref name=\"Vucetich 2005\"/><ref name=\"Deschamp 2007\"/> This is largely due to the recognition that capybara [[Molar (tooth)|molar]] teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual.<ref name=\"Vucetich 2005\"/> In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, ''Cardiatherium paranense''.<ref name=\"Vucetich 2005\"/>\n\n==Description==\n[[file:Taxidermy specimen of Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).jpg|thumb|left|Taxidermy specimen of a Capybara]]\n[[File:Capybara skeleton.jpg|thumb|Capybara skeleton]]\nThe capybara has a heavy, [[barrel]]-shaped body and short head, with reddish-brown fur on the upper part of its body that turns yellowish-brown underneath.

They eat a greater variety of plants during the dry season, as fewer plants are available. While they eat grass during the wet season, they have to switch to more abundant reeds during the dry season.<ref name=\"Barreto 1998\"/> Plants that capybaras eat during the summer lose their nutritional value in the winter, so are not consumed at that time.<ref name=\"Quintana 1998\"/> The capybara's jaw hinge is not perpendicular, so they chew food by grinding back-and-forth rather than side-to-side.<ref name=\"SFZoo\"/> Capybaras are auto[[coprophagous]], meaning they eat their own [[feces]] as a source of bacterial [[gut flora]], to help [[digestion|digest]] the [[cellulose]] in the grass that forms their normal diet, and to extract the maximum protein and vitamins from their food. They may also regurgitate food to masticate again, similar to cud-chewing by [[cattle]].<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> As is the case with other rodents, the front teeth of capybaras grow continually to compensate for the constant wear from eating grasses;<ref name=\"Bristol\"/> their cheek teeth also grow continuously.<ref name=\"SFZoo\"/>\n\nLike its relative the guinea pig, the capybara does not have the capacity to synthesize [[vitamin C]], and capybaras not supplemented with vitamin C in captivity have been reported to develop gum disease as a sign of [[scurvy]].<ref name=r2/>\n\nThey can have a [[life expectancy|lifespan]] of 8\u201310 years,<ref name=r6/> but live less than four years in the wild, because they are \"a favourite food of [[South American jaguar|jaguar]], [[South American cougar|puma]], [[ocelot]], [[eagle]], and [[caiman]]\".<ref name=\"Bristol\"/> The capybara is also the preferred [[prey]] of the [[Eunectes murinus|anaconda]].<ref name=\"SoundsandColours\"/>\n\n== Social organization ==\n[[File:Capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) alpha male.JPG|thumb|right|Capybaras have a scent gland on their noses, called a morillo]]\n\nCapybaras are known to be [[gregarious]].

The anal glands of males are also lined with detachable hairs. A crystalline form of scent secretion is coated on these hairs and is released when in contact with objects such as plants. These hairs have a longer-lasting scent mark and are tasted by other capybaras. Capybaras scent-mark by rubbing their morillos on objects, or by walking over scrub and marking it with their anal glands. Capybaras can spread their scent further by urinating; however, females usually mark without urinating and scent-mark less frequently than males overall. Females mark more often during the wet season when they are in [[estrus]]. In addition to objects, males also scent-mark females.<ref name=\"Macdonald 1984\"/>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\n[[File:Young capybaras.jpg|thumb|right|Mother with typical litter of four pups.]]\n\nWhen in [[estrus]], the female's scent changes subtly and nearby males begin pursuit.<ref name=\"Herrera 1993\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/4.2.114|title= Aggression, dominance, and mating success among capybara males (''Hydrochaeris hypdrochaeris'')|year=1993|last1=Herrera|first1=Emilio A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=David W.|journal=[[Behavioral Ecology (journal)|Behavioral Ecology]]|volume=4|issue=2|page=114}}</ref> In addition, a female alerts males she is in estrus by whistling through her nose.<ref name=\"Lord-Rexford 1994\"/> During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice.
