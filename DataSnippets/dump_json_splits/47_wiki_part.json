He worked as a translator for the [[United Nations]] from 1956 to 1961 and then for the [[World Health Organization]].\n\nHe was a prolific author of [[Esperanto]] works. He spoke Esperanto from childhood and used it in [[Japan]], the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], in [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]], and in nearly all the countries of [[Europe]].\n\n== Life ==\nPiron was a psychotherapist and taught from 1973 to 1994 in the psychology department at the [[University of Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]].  His French-language book ''Le d\u00e9fi des langues \u2014 Du g\u00e2chis au bon sens'' (The Language Challenge: From Chaos to Common Sense, 1994) is a kind of [[psychoanalysis]] of international communication. A [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] version, ''O desafio das linguas'', was published in 2002 (Campinas, S\u00e3o Paulo, Pontes).\n\nIn a lecture on the current system of international communication <ref>[http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/effects.htm http://claudepiron.free.fr/articlesenanglais/effects.htm]</ref> Piron argued that \"Esperanto relies entirely on innate reflexes\" and \"differs from all other languages in that you can always trust your natural tendency to generalize patterns... The same neuropsychological law...\u2014called by [[Jean Piaget]] ''generalizing assimilation''\u2014applies to word formation as well as to grammar.\"\n\nHis diverse Esperanto writings include instructional books, books for beginners, novels, short stories, poems, articles and non-fiction books.  His most famous works are ''[[Gerda malaperis!]]'' and ''[[La Bona Lingvo]]'' (The Good Language).\n\n''Gerda malaperis!'' is a novella which uses basic grammar and vocabulary in the first chapter and builds up to expert Esperanto by the end, including word lists so that beginners may easily follow along.\n\nIn ''La Bona Lingvo'', Piron captures the basic linguistic and social aspects of Esperanto.  He argues strongly for imaginative use of the basic Esperanto [[morpheme]] inventory and word-formation techniques, and against unnecessary importation of neologisms from European languages.  He also presents the idea that, once one has learned enough vocabulary to express himself, it is easier to think clearly in Esperanto than in many other languages.\n\nPiron is the author of a book in French, ''Le bonheur cl\u00e9s en main'' (The Keys to Happiness), which distinguishes among pleasure, happiness and joy. He shows how one may avoid contributing to his own \"anti-happiness\" (''l'anti-bonheur'') and how one may expand the areas of happiness in his life. Piron's view is that, while one may desire happiness, desire is not enough. Just as people must do certain things in order to become physically stronger, they must do certain things in order to become happier. Those are the things that he describes in this book.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Esperanto]]\n*[[Translation#Machine translation|Machine translation]]\n\n==References==\n*Claude Piron, ''Le d\u00e9fi des langues \u2014 Du g\u00e2chis au bon sens'' (The Language Challenge:  From Chaos to Common Sense), Paris, L'Harmattan, 1994.\n*Claude Piron, \"Le bonheur cl\u00e9s en main\" (The Keys to Happiness), Saint-Maurice, Saint Augustin, 1998.\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://claudepiron.free.fr/articles.htm Articles and texts in many languages] by Claude Piron\n* [http://www.translationdirectory.com/esperanto.htm Articles in English] by Claude Piron\n* {{YouTube|_YHALnLV9XU|The language challenge\u2014facing up to reality }}\n* {{YouTube|H0D9S5aUn70|Les langues: un d\u00e9fi - Pt1 }}-{{YouTube|jbpJ9ZYHUuc| Pt2 }}-{{YouTube|wceKmni9-wI| Pt3 }}-{{YouTube|N8OPHt4npHM| Pt4 }}-{{YouTube|Pq9cveurcg0| Pt5 }}-{{YouTube|-E0Fq7P0W28| Pt6 }}-{{YouTube|GBa78ZLRljc| Pt7 }}-{{YouTube|5yJoAPVVHyc| Pt8 }}-{{YouTube|bs27f-TlZu4| Pt9 }}-{{YouTube|dpUVi4T8Pq0| Pt10 }}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2011}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Piron, Claude}}\n[[Category:Writers of Esperanto literature]]\n[[Category:1931 births]]\n[[Category:2008 deaths]]\n[[Category:Swiss Esperantists]]", "sha1": "624t6lursltm76k54de3h77bj342ubk"}}, {"title": "Captain America", "ns": "0", "id": "7729", "revision": {"id": "864433216", "parentid": "864377501", "timestamp": "2018-10-17T05:07:33Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rockerfish", "id": "29406102"}, "comment": "/* Tactician and field commander */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{About|Steve Rogers|the subsequent versions of the character|List of incarnations of Captain America}}\n{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n| image          = CaptainAmerica109.jpg\n| converted      = y\n| caption        = ''Captain America'' #109 (January 1969).<br />Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Syd Shores]].\n| alt            = Captain America bursting through a page of newspaper\n| alter_ego      = Steven \"Steve\" Rogers\n| publisher      = [[Marvel Comics]]\n| debut          = ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 (March 1941) \n| creators       = [[Joe Simon]]<br>[[Jack Kirby]]\n| alliances      = {{Plain list | \n* [[All-Winners Squad]]\n* [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]\n* [[Uncanny Avengers|Avengers Unity Division]]\n* [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]]\n* [[Invaders (comics)|Invaders]]\n* [[Landau, Luckman, and Lake]]\n* [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]]\n* [[Weapon Plus#Weapon I|Project: Rebirth]]\n* [[Redeemers (comics)|Redeemers]]\n* [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]\n* [[Civil War (comics)|Secret Avengers]] (Civil War)\n* [[Secret Avengers]]\n* [[Secret Defenders]]\n* [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]\n* [[New York City Police Department]]\n}}\n| aliases=[[Nomad (comics)|Nomad]], The Captain\n| partners= {{Plain list | \n* [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Bucky (James Barnes)]]\n* [[Peggy Carter]]\n* [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]] \n* [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]]\n* [[Rick Jones (comics)|Bucky (Rick Jones)]]\n* [[Jack Monroe (comics)|Nomad (Jack Monroe)]]\n* [[Free Spirit (comics)|Free Spirit]] \n* [[Jack Flag]] \n* [[Demolition Man (comics)|Demolition Man]] \n* [[Rikki Barnes|Bucky (Rikki Barnes)]]\n* [[Sharon Carter]]\n}}\n| supports       = <!--optional-->\n| powers         =\n*Peak human strength, speed, durability, agility, reflexes, senses, and mental processing\n*Master martial artist and hand-to-hand combatant \n*Accelerated healing factor\n*Expert tactician, strategist, and field commander\n*Wields [[Captain America's shield|vibranium-steel alloy shield]]\n| cat            = super\n| subcat         = Marvel Comics\n| hero           = y\n| sortkey        = Captain America\n}}\n\n'''Captain America''' is a [[character (fiction)|fictional superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[cartoonists]] [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]], the character [[First appearance|first appeared]] in ''[[#Golden Age|Captain America Comics]]'' #1 ([[cover date]]d March 1941) from [[Timely Comics]], a predecessor of Marvel Comics. Captain America was designed as a [[American patriotism|patriotic]] [[supersoldier]] who often fought the [[Axis powers]] of [[World War II]] and was Timely Comics' most popular character during the wartime period. The popularity of superheroes waned following the war and the ''Captain America'' comic book was discontinued in 1950, with a short-lived revival in 1953. Since Marvel Comics revived the character in 1964, Captain America has remained in publication.\n\nThe character wears a costume bearing an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] [[motif (visual arts)|motif]], and he utilizes a [[Captain America's shield|nearly indestructible shield which he throws as a projectile]]. Captain America is the [[alter ego]] of '''Steve Rogers''', a frail young man enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental serum to aid the [[United States]] government's efforts in World War II. Near the end of the war, he was trapped in ice and survived in [[Cryopreservation|suspended animation]] until he was revived in the present day. Although Captain America often struggles to maintain his ideals as a man out of his time with its modern realities, he remains a highly respected figure in his community which includes becoming the long-time leader of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].\n\nCaptain America was the first Marvel Comics character to appear in media outside comics with the release of the 1944 [[Serial (film)|movie serial]], ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]''. Since then, the character has been featured in [[Captain America in other media|other films and television series]]. In the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), the character is portrayed by [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] in ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'', ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'', ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018) and the fourth [[Untitled Avengers film|Avengers film]].\n\nCaptain America is ranked sixth on [[IGN]]'s \"Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time\" in 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|title=IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes|date= 2011|publisher=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150630173526/http://www.ign.com/top/comic-book-heroes/6|archivedate= June 30, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate= July 9, 2015}}</ref> second in their list of \"The Top 50 Avengers\" in 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|date= April 30, 2012 |title= The Top 50 Avengers|publisher=IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20151129171205/http://www.ign.com/top/avengers/2|archivedate= November 29, 2015|deadurl= no|accessdate=July 28, 2015}}</ref> and second in their \"Top 25 best Marvel superheroes\" list in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|title=Top 25 Best Marvel Superheroes|first1= Joshua|last1= Yehl|first2= Jeff|last2= Lake|date= September 10, 2014|publisher= IGN|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141031191046/http://m.ign.com/articles/2014/09/10/top-25-best-marvel-superheroes|archivedate= October 31, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate= October 19, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Publication history==\n{{further|List of Captain America titles}}\n\n===Creation===\nIn 1940, writer [[Joe Simon]] conceived the idea for Captain America and made a sketch of the character in costume.<ref>1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program, cover</ref> \"I wrote the name 'Super American' at the bottom of the page,\" Simon said in his autobiography, and then decided: \n\n{{quote|No, it didn't work.

Needing to fill a full comic with primarily one character's stories, Simon did not believe that his regular creative partner, artist [[Jack Kirby]], could handle the workload alone:\n\n{{quote|I didn't have a lot of objections to putting a crew on the first issue&nbsp; ... There were two young artists from [[Connecticut]] that had made a strong impression on me. [[Al Avison]] and [[Al Gabriele]] often worked together and were quite successful in adapting their individual styles to each other. Actually, their work was not too far from [that of] Kirby's. If they worked on it, and if one inker tied the three styles together, I believed the final product would emerge as quite uniform. The two Als were eager to join in on the new ''Captain America'' book, but Jack Kirby was visibly upset. \"You're still number one, Jack,\" I assured him. \"It's just a matter of a quick deadline for the first issue.\"\n\n\"I'll make the deadline,\" Jack promised. \"I'll pencil it [all] myself and make the deadline.\" I hadn't expected this kind of reaction&nbsp; ... but I acceded to Kirby's wishes and, it turned out, was lucky that I did. There might have been two Als, but there was only one Jack Kirby ... I wrote the first ''Captain America'' book with penciled lettering right on the drawing boards, with very rough sketches for figures and backgrounds. Kirby did his thing, building the muscular anatomy, adding ideas and pepping up the action as only he could. Then he tightened up the penciled drawings, adding detailed backgrounds, faces and figures.\"<ref name=joesimonp50 />}}\n\n[[File:1974ComicArtCon book.jpg|thumb|1974 [[Comic Art Convention]] program featuring Simon's original sketch of Captain America.]]\nAl Liederman would ink that first issue, which was lettered by Simon and Kirby's regular letterer, Howard Ferguson.<ref>Simon, p. 51.</ref>\n\nSimon said Captain America was a consciously political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by the actions of [[Nazi Germany]] in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in [[World War II]] and felt war was inevitable: \"The opponents to the war were all quite well organized.

To prevent a recurrence of the situation, Rogers modified the mask with connecting material to his uniform, an added benefit of which was extending his armor to cover his previously exposed neck. As a member of the Avengers, Rogers has an Avengers priority card, which serves as a communications device.\n\nCaptain America has used a custom specialized motorcycle, modified by the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] weapons laboratory, as well as a custom-built battle van, constructed by the [[Wakanda (comics)|Wakanda]] Design Group with the ability to change its color for disguise purposes (red, white and blue), and fitted to store and conceal the custom motorcycle in its rear section with a frame that allows Rogers to launch from the vehicle riding it.\n\n==Antagonists==\n{{Main|List of Captain America enemies}}\nCaptain America has faced numerous foes in over 70 years of published adventures. Many of his recurring foes embody ideologies contrary to the American values that Captain America is shown to strive for and believes in. Some examples of these opposing values are Nazism ([[Red Skull]], [[Baron Zemo]]), [[neo-Nazism]] ([[Crossbones (comics)|Crossbones]], [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Doctor Faustus]]), technocratic fascism ([[Advanced Idea Mechanics|AIM]], [[Arnim Zola]]), Communism ([[Aleksander Lukin]]), anarchism ([[Flag Smasher]]) and international and domestic terrorism ([[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]]).\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Captain America}}\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Captain America in other media}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{Portal|Superhero fiction|United States|Comics}}\n\n*{{cite web | last=Gladstone | first=Brooke | url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/129271-death-to-america/#transcript | title= Death to America | publisher=Transcript and streaming audio; [[Ed Brubaker]] and [[Joe Simon]] interviewed|work=[[On the Media]]|date=March 9, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2007}}\n*{{cite web | last=Powell | first=Matt | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | date=March 7, 2007 | title=Captain America Remembered | accessdate=July 27, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309130111/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/003800596.cfm|archivedate=March 9, 2007}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20140502000500/http://captainamericalibrary.com/ Captain America Library] (fan site).

The countercult movement asserts that particular Christian sects whose beliefs they deem partially or wholly not in accordance with the [[Bible]] are erroneous. It also states that a religious sect can be considered a [[cult]] if its beliefs involve a denial of what they view as any of the essential [[Christian]] teachings (such as [[salvation]], the [[Trinity]],{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} [[Jesus]] himself as a person, the [[ministry of Jesus|ministry]] and [[miracles of Jesus]], [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]], [[Resurrection of Jesus|his resurrection]], the [[Second Coming]] and the [[Rapture]]).<ref>Walter R.

Wayne House & Gordon Carle, ''Doctrine Twisting: How Core Biblical Truths are Distorted'', Downers Grove: IVP, 2003.</ref>\n\nCountercult ministries often concern themselves with religious sects which consider themselves Christian but which hold beliefs thought to contradict the [[Bible]]. Such sects may include: [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Unification Church]], [[Christian Science]], and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. [[Anti-Catholicism|Anti-Catholic ideology]] has led some Protestants to classify Catholicism as a [[cult]]. John Highham described anti-Catholicism as \"the most luxuriant, tenacious tradition of paranoiac agitation in American history\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Philip |authorlink= Philip Jenkins |title = The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice |publisher= Oxford University Press |date= 1 April 2003 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=p5SW0l7ciokC&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&vq=%22the+most+luxuriant,+tenacious+tradition+of+paranoiac+agitation+in+American+history%22 |isbn= 978-0-19-515480-1 |page= 23 }}</ref> Some also denounce non-Christian religions such as [[Islam]], [[Wicca]], [[Paganism]], [[New Age]] groups, [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]] and other religions.\n\nCountercult literature usually expresses doctrinal or theological concerns and a [[missionary]] or [[apologetics|apologetic]] purpose.<ref>Garry W.

Christian countercult activist writers also emphasize the need for Christians to [[evangelism|evangelize]] to followers of [[cult]]s.<ref>Walter R. Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', rev.ed.

The [[Apostle Paul]] wrote an entire epistle, [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]], antagonistic to the teachings of a Jewish sect that claimed adherence to the teachings of both Jesus and Moses (cf. Acts 15: & Gal. 1:6-10). The [[Apostle John]] devoted his [[First Epistle of John|first Epistle]] to countering early proto-gnostic cults that had arisen in the first century, all claiming to be \"Christian\" (1 Jn. 2:19).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe early Church in the post-apostolic period was much more involved in \"defending its frontiers against alternative soteriologies&nbsp;\u2014 either by defining its own position with greater and greater exactness, or by attacking other religions, and particularly the [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Hellenistic mysteries]].\"<ref>[[Eric J.

This was reflected in several chapters contributed to the multi-volume work released in 1915 ''The Fundamentals'', where apologists criticised the teachings of [[Charles Taze Russell]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]], the [[Mormons]] and Spiritualists.<ref>William G.

Some examples of sources (with published dates where known) that documented this approach are:\n\n*''The Missionary Faces Isms'', by John C.

His book, ''The Chaos of Cults'', which was first published in 1938, became a classic in the field as it was repeatedly revised and updated until 1962.<ref>J.K.van Baalen, ''The Chaos of Cults'', 4th rev.ed.Grand Rapids: William Eerdmans Publishing, 1962.</ref>\n\n===Walter Martin===\nHistorically, one of the most important protagonists of the movement was [[Walter Ralston Martin|Walter Martin]] (1928\u201389), whose numerous books include the 1955 ''The Rise of the Cults: An Introductory Guide to the Non-Christian Cults'' and the 1965 ''[[The Kingdom of the Cults|The Kingdom of the Cults: An Analysis of Major Cult Systems in the Present Christian Era]]'', which continues to be influential. He became well known in conservative Christian circles through a radio program, \"The Bible Answer Man\", currently hosted by [[Hank Hanegraaff]].\n\nIn ''The Rise of the Cults''<ref>Walter R. Martin, ''The Rise of the Cults'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1955, pp. 11-12.</ref> Martin gave the following definition of a cult:\n\n<blockquote>By cultism we mean the adherence to doctrines which are pointedly contradictory to orthodox Christianity and which yet claim the distinction of either tracing their origin to orthodox sources or of being in essential harmony with those sources. Cultism, in short, is any major deviation from orthodox Christianity relative to the cardinal doctrines of the Christian faith.</blockquote>\n\nAs Martin's definition suggests, the countercult ministries concentrate on non-traditional groups that claim to be Christian, so chief targets have been [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (i.e., \"Mormons\"), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Armstrongism]], [[Church of Christ, Scientist|Christian Science]] and the [[Unification Church]], but also smaller groups like the [[Swedenborgian Church]]<ref>Each of these movements are treated in separate chapters in Walter R. Martin, ''The Kingdom of the Cults'', rev. ed. Ravi Zacharias ed. Bloomington: Bethany House, 2003.</ref>\n\nVarious other conservative Christian leaders\u2014among them [[John Ankerberg]] and [[Norman Geisler]]\u2014have emphasized themes similar to Martin's.<ref>John Ankerberg & John Weldon, ''Cult Watch'', Eugene: Harvest House, 1991, pp. i-x.</ref><ref>Geisler & Rhodes, ''When Cultists Ask'', pp. 10-11.</ref>  Perhaps more importantly, numerous other well-known conservative Christian leaders as well as many conservative pastors have accepted Martin's definition of a cult as well as his understanding of the groups to which he gave that label. Dave Breese<ref>Dave Breese, ''Know the Marks of Cults'', Wheaton: Victor, 1975, 14.</ref> summed up this kind of definition<ref>Compare this definition with ''[[Christian heresy|heresy]]''.</ref> in these words:\n<blockquote>A cult is a religious perversion. It is a belief and practice in the world of religion which calls for devotion to a religious view or leader centered in false doctrine. It is an organized heresy. A cult may take many forms but it is basically a religious movement which distorts or warps orthodox faith to the point where truth becomes perverted into a lie. A cult is impossible to define except against the absolute standard of the teaching of Holy Scripture.</blockquote>\n\n===Discernment Blogging===\nKenne \"Ken\" Silva is said by other discernment bloggers to have pioneered online discernment ministry.<ref>Marsha West, \"Online discernment ministries \u2014 the new lepers\" http://bereanresearch.org/online-discernment-ministries-new-lepers/</ref> Ken was a Baptist pastor who ran the discernment blog Apprising. Silva wrote many blog articles about the [[Emergent Church|Emerging Church]], the [[Word of Faith|Word of Faith Movement]], [[Mormonism]], the [[Jehovah's Witness]], the [[Gay Christian Movement]], and many other groups. He started his blog in 2005 and wrote there until his death in 2014.<ref>Amy Spreeman, \"Online Memorial for Pastor Ken Silva\" http://standupforthetruth.com/2014/10/online-memorial-pastor-ken-silva-10614/</ref>\n\nSilva's work paved the way for other internet discernment ministries such as Pirate Christian Radio, a group of blogs and podcasts founded by Lutheran Pastor Chris Rosebrough in 2008,<ref>http://www.piratechristian.com/contributors/</ref> and Pulpit & Pen, a discernment blog founded by Baptist Pastor and polemicist J.D. Hall.\n\n==Other technical terminology==\nSince the 1980s the term \"new religions\" or \"[[new religious movement]]s\" has slowly entered into Evangelical usage alongside the word \"cult\". Some book titles use both terms.<ref>Richard Abanes, ''Cults, New Religious Movements, and Your Family'', Wheaton: Crossway, 1998.</ref><ref>Ronald Enroth ed. ''A Guide to New Religious Movements'', Downers Grove: IVP, 2005.</ref><ref>Ron Rhodes, ''The Challenge of the Cults and New Religions'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2001.</ref>\n\nThe acceptance of these alternatives to the word \"cult\" in Evangelicalism reflects, in part, the wider usage of such language in the [[sociology of religion]].<ref>On sociological understandings see for example Eileen Barker, ''New Religious Movements: A Practical Introduction'', London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1989. George D. Chryssides, ''Exploring New Religions'', London & New York: Cassell, 1999.Jacob Needleman & George Baker ed. ''Understanding the New Religions'', New York: Seabury Press, 1981. [[Mikael Rothstein]] & Reender Kranenborg ed. ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'', Aarhus, Denmark: Aargus University Press, 2003.</ref>\n\n==Apologetics==\nThe term \"countercult [[apologetic]]s\" first appeared in Protestant Evangelical literature as a self-designation in the late 1970s and early 1980s in articles by [[Ronald Enroth]] and David Fetcho, and by Walter Martin in ''Martin Speaks Out on the Cults''.<ref>Ronald M. Enroth, \"Cult/Counter-cult\", ''Eternity'', November 1977, pp.18-22 & 32-35. David Fetcho, \"Disclosing the Unknown God: Evangelism to the New Religions\", ''Update: A Quarterly Journal on New Religious Movements'' Volume 6, number 4 December 1982 p.8. Walter R. Martin, ''Martin Speaks Out On The Cults'', rev. ed. Ventura: Vision House, 1983, pp.124-125.</ref> A mid-1980s debate about apologetic methodology between Ronald Enroth and J. Gordon Melton, led the latter to place more emphasis in his publications on differentiating the Christian countercult from the secular anti-cult.<ref>Ronald M. Enroth and J. Gordon Melton, ''Why Cults Succeed Where The Church Fails'', Elgin: Brethren, 1985, pp. 25-30.</ref> Eric Pement urged Melton to adopt the label \"Christian countercult\",<ref>Eric Pement, \u2018Comments on the Directory\u2019 in Keith Edward Tolbert and Eric Pement, ''The 1993 Directory of Cult Research Organizations'', Trenton: American Religions Center, 1993, p. x.</ref> and since the early 1990s the terms has entered into popular usage and is recognised by sociologists such as [[Douglas E. Cowan|Douglas Cowan]].<ref>Douglas E. Cowan, ''Bearing False Witness? An Introduction to the Christian Countercult'', Westport: Praeger, 2003.</ref>\n\nThe only existing umbrella organization within the countercult movement in the USA is the [[EMNR]] (Evangelical Ministries to New Religions) founded in 1982 which has the evangelical [[Lausanne Covenant]] as governing document and which stresses mission, scholarship, accountability and networking.\n\n==Worldwide organizations==\nWhile the greatest number of countercult ministries are found in the USA, ministries exist in [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Philippines]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]],  [[Sweden]], and [[Ukraine]]. A comparison between the methods employed in the USA and other nations discloses some similarities in emphasis, but also other nuances in emphasis. The similarities are that globally these ministries share a common concern about the evangelization of people in cults and new religions. There is also often a common thread of comparing orthodox doctrines and biblical passages with the teachings of the groups under examination. However, in some of the European and southern hemisphere contexts, confrontational methods of engagement are not always relied on, and dialogical approaches are sometimes advocated.\n\nA group of organizations which originated within the context of established religion is working in more general fields of cult-awareness, especially in Europe. Their leaders are theologians, and they are often social ministries affiliated to big churches.\n\n===Protestant===\n* Berlin-based Pfarramt f\u00fcr Sekten- und Weltanschauungsfragen<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ekbo.sekteninformation.de|title=Index - Informationen und Standpunkte|author=Pfr.

An initial step in this direction occurred in 1980 when the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization convened a mini-consultation in Thailand. From that consultation a position paper was produced.<ref>''[http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=14647 The Thailand Report on New Religious Movements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117192327/http://www.lausanne.org/Brix?pageID=14647 |date=17 January 2006 }}''</ref> The issue was revisited at the Lausanne Forum in 2004 with another paper.<ref>''[http://www.lausanne.org/lcwe/assets/LOP45_IG16.pdf Religious and Non-Religious Spirituality in the Western World]''</ref> The latter paper adopts a different methodology to that advocated in 1980.\n\nIn the 1990s discussions in academic missions and theological journals indicate that another trajectory is emerging which reflects the influence of contextual missions theory. Advocates of this approach maintain that apologetics as a tool needs to be retained, but do not favour a confrontational style of engagement.<ref>Irving Hexham, Stephen Rost & John W. Morehead ed. ''Encountering New Religious Movements: A Holistic Evangelical Approach'', Grand Rapids: Kregel, 2004.Gordon R. Lewis, \"Our Mission Responsibility to New Religious Movements\" ''International Journal of Frontier Missions'' Volume 15, number 3 July\u2013September 1998, p. 116.</ref>\n\n==Variations and models==\nCountercult apologetics has several variations and methods employed in analysing and responding to cults. The different nuances in countercult apologetics have been discussed by [[John A. Saliba]] and Philip Johnson.<ref>Saliba, ''Understanding New Religious Movements'', pp.212-223. Philip Johnson, \"Apologetics, Mission and New Religious Movements: A Holistic Approach,\" ''Sacred Tribes Journal'', Volume 1, number 1 Fall 2002 5-220.</ref>\n\nThe dominant method is the emphasis on detecting unorthodox or heretical doctrines and contrasting those with orthodox interpretations of the Bible and early creedal documents. Some apologists, such as [[Francis J. Beckwith]], have emphasised a philosophical approach, pointing out logical, [[epistemological]] and metaphysical problems within the teachings of a particular group.<ref>Francis J. Beckwith & Stephen E. Parrish, ''See the gods fall'', Joplin: College Press, 1997. Francis J. Beckwith, Carl Mosser & Paul Owen ed. ''The New Mormon Challenge'', Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 2002.</ref> Another approach involves former members of cultic groups recounting their spiritual autobiographies, which highlight experiences of disenchantment with the group, unanswered questions and doubts about commitment to the group, culminating in the person's conversion to Evangelical Christianity.<ref>James R.

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in [[Uncanny X-Men|''The X-Men'']] #1 (September 1963).\n\nXavier is a member of a subspecies of humans known as [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], who are born with superhuman abilities. The founder of the [[X-Men]], Xavier is an exceptionally powerful [[telepath]] who can read and control the minds of others. To both shelter and train mutants from around the world, he runs a [[X-Mansion|private school]] in [[Salem Center, New York|Salem Center]], located in [[Westchester County, New York]].<ref>{{cite book|last = Sanderson|first = Peter|authorlink =|coauthors =|title = ''The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City''|publisher = [[Pocket Books]]|year = 2007|location = New York City|pages = 214|url =|doi =|id =|isbn = 1-4165-3141-6}}</ref> Xavier also strives to serve a greater good by promoting peaceful coexistence and equality between humans and mutants in a world where zealous anti-mutant [[bigotry]] is widespread.\n\nThroughout much of the character's history in comics, Xavier is a [[Paraplegia|paraplegic]] variously using either a wheelchair or a modified version of one. One of the world's most powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] telepaths, Xavier is a [[science|scientific]] [[genius]] and a leading authority in [[genetics]]. Furthermore, he has shown noteworthy talents in devising equipment to greatly enhance psionic powers. Xavier is perhaps best known in this regard for the creation of a device called [[Cerebro]], a technology that serves to detect and track those individuals possessing the mutant gene, at the same time greatly expanding the gifts of those with existing psionic abilities.\n\nFrom a social policy and philosophical perspective, Xavier deeply resents the violent methods of those like his former close friend and occasional enemy, the [[supervillain]] [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. Instead, he has presented his platform of uncompromising pacifism to see his dream to fruition - one that seeks to live harmoniously alongside humanity, just the same as it desires full-fledged civil rights and equality for all mutants. Xavier's actions and goals in life have therefore often been compared to those of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] for his involvement with the [[Civil rights movement|American civil rights struggle]],<ref name=\"Shutt 38\">{{cite web|last=Godoski |first=Andrew |url=http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |title=Professor X And Magneto: Allegories For Martin Luther King Jr. And Malcolm X |publisher=Screened |date=June 1, 2011 |accessdate=April 16, 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109071039/http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}</ref> whereas Magneto is often compared with the more militant civil rights activist [[Malcolm X]].<ref name=\"Shutt 38\"/>\n\nThe character's creation and development occurred simultaneously with the civil rights struggle, taking place in the 1960s, while Xavier's first appearance dates to 1963. The fictionalized plight in the comics of mutantkind faced with exceptional intolerance and prejudice was done in large part to better illustrate to audiences of the day what was transpiring across the United States, just the same as it also served to further promote ideals of tolerance and equality for all.<ref name=\"LeeCivilRights\">{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Patrick Stewart]] portrayed the character in seven films in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]] and in various video games, while [[James McAvoy]] portrayed a younger version of the character in the 2011 prequel ''[[X-Men: First Class]]''.

To achieve these aims, he founded Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (later named the [[X-Mansion|Xavier Institute]]) to teach mutants to explore and control their powers. Its first group of students was the original X-Men ([[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], and [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]). Xavier's students consider him a visionary and often refer to their mission as \"Xavier's dream\". He is highly regarded by others in the [[Marvel Universe]], respected by various governments, and trusted by several other superhero teams, including the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and the [[Fantastic Four]]. However, he also has a manipulative streak which has resulted in several significant fallings-out with allies and students.\n\nHe often acts as a public advocate for mutant rights and is the authority most of the Marvel superhero community turns to for advice on mutants. Despite this, his status as a mutant himself and originator of the X-Men only became public during the [[2001 in comics|2001]] story \"[[E Is for Extinction]]\". He also appears in almost all of the X-Men animated series and in many video games, although usually as a [[non-playable character]] because of his disability. [[Patrick Stewart]] plays him in the 2000s [[X-Men (film)|film series]], as well as providing his voice in some of the X-Men video games (including some not connected to the film series).\n\n[[File:ProfX-XMen1.jpg|thumb|right|Professor X as he appears in his debut comic book, ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 (1963).

Perhaps the most notable appearance of this character element is in the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] storyline, in which the [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] event's antagonist is a physical manifestation of that dark side. Also, Onslaught is created in the most violent act Xavier claims to have done: erasing the mind of Magneto. In ''X-Men'' <!-- only denote volume number after first --> #106 (August 1977), the new X-Men fight images of the original team, which have been created by what Xavier says is his \"evil self ... who would use his powers for personal gain and conquest\", which he says he is normally able to keep in check. In the 1984 four-part series titled ''The X-Men and the Micronauts'', Xavier's dark desires manifest themselves as the Entity and threaten to destroy the Micronauts' universe.\n\nIn other instances, Xavier is shown to be secretive and manipulative. During the [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] storyline, the X-Men find Xavier's files, the \"[[Xavier Protocols]]\", which detail how to kill many of the characters, including Xavier himself, should the need ever arise, such as if they went rogue.<ref>{{Cite comic | Writer = [[Scott Lobdell]] | Penciller = [[Joe Madureira]] | Inker = Tim Townsend | Story = \"Onslaught, Phase 1: Apocalypse Lives\" | Title = Uncanny X-Men | Volume = | Issue = 335 |date=August 1996|Publisher = [[Marvel Comics]]}}</ref> ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' vol. 3, #12 (August 2005) reveals that when Xavier realizes that the [[Danger Room]] has become sentient, he keeps it trapped and experiments on it for years, an act that Cyclops calls \"the oppression of a new life\" and equates to humanity's treatment of mutants (however, ''X-Men Legacy'' #220 - 224 reveals that Xavier did not intend for the Danger Room to become sentient: it was an accident, and Xavier sought a way to free Danger, but was unable to find a way to accomplish this without deleting her sentience as well).\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n{{Very long|section|date=January 2016}}\nCharles Francis Xavier was born in [[New York City]] to the wealthy Dr. Brian Xavier, a well-respected [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] scientist, and Sharon Xavier. The family lives on a very grand mansion estate in [[Westchester County]] because of the riches his father's nuclear research has brought them. He later grows up to attend [[Oxford University]], where he earns a Professorship in Genetics and other science fields, and goes on to live in first Oxford and then [[London]] for a number of years. Crucially, as he enters late adolescence, Xavier inherits the mansion-house he was raised in, enabling him not only to continue to live in it, but also to turn it in to '''Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters''', which he begins together with the first of the [[X-Men]].\n\nBrian, his father, dies in an accident when Xavier is still very young, and Brian's science partner Kurt Marko comforts and then marries the grieving Sharon. When Xavier's telepathic mutant powers emerge, he discovers Marko cares only about his mother's money.<ref name = \"shfajr\">''X-Men'' #12</ref>\n\n[[File:Profxy.PNG|thumb|left|A young Charles Xavier.

Kurt quickly grows neglectful of Sharon, driving her to alcoholism, and abuses both Charles and Cain. Cain takes out his frustrations and insecurities on his stepbrother. Charles uses his telepathic powers to read Cain's mind and explore the extent of his psychological damage, which only leads to Cain becoming more aggressive toward him and the young Xavier feeling Cain's pain firsthand.<ref name = \"shfajr\">''X-Men'' #12</ref>\n\nSharon dies soon after, and a fight erupts between Cain and Charles that causes some of Kurt's lab equipment to explode.

Due to his powers, by the time he graduates from high school, Charles loses all of his hair. He graduates with [[Latin honors|honors]] at the age of 16 from [[Bard College]].{{issue|date=March 2017}} In graduate studies, he receives [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.s]] in [[Genetics]], [[Biophysics]], [[Psychology]], and [[Anthropology]] with a two-year residence at [[Pembroke College, Oxford|Pembroke College]], [[Oxford University]].<ref name = \"ydnsmw\">{{cite book | author = Yaco, Linc, Haber, Karen |date=February 2004 | title = The Science of the X-Men | page = 24 | publisher = I Books/Marvel | isbn = 0-7434-8725-7}}</ref> He also receives an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in [[Psychiatry]] while spending several years in [[London, England|London]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #389; graphic of Pembroke College's Old Quad</ref><ref name = \"xkhfzr\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #117</ref> He is later appointed [[Adjunct Professor]] at [[Columbia University]].<ref name = \"xaqplc\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #192-193</ref> ''Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men'' #1 (2010) presents a different version of events, suggesting a scholarship to Oxford University rescued him from his abusive home, after which he \"never looked back\", suggesting he began his academic career as a very young man at Oxford.<ref>''Origins of Marvel Comics: X-Men'' #1. 2010.</ref> His stepbrother is resentful of him.{{issue|date=April 2014}}\n\nAt [[graduate school]], he meets a [[Scotland|Scottish]] girl named [[Moira MacTaggert|Moira Kinross]], a fellow genetics student with whom he falls in love.

He later discovers that Moira married her old boyfriend Joseph MacTaggert, who abuses her.<ref name = \"shfajr\"/><ref name = \"xkhfzr\"/><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #389</ref>\n\nDeeply depressed when Moira broke off their engagement without explanation, Xavier began traveling around the world as an adventurer after leaving the army. In [[Cairo]], he meets a young girl named [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Ororo Munroe]] (later known as Storm), who is a pickpocket, and the [[Shadow King]], a powerful mutant who is posing as Egyptian crime lord Amahl Farouk. Xavier defeats the Shadow King, barely escaping with his life. This encounter leads to Xavier's decision to devote his life to protecting humanity from evil mutants and safeguarding innocent mutants from human oppression.<ref name = \"xkhfzr\"/>\n\n[[File:Xavmags.png|thumb|Xavier and [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] part ways due to the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]\nXavier visits his friend Daniel Shomron, who runs a clinic for traumatized [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] victims in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]]. There, he meets a man going by the name of Magnus (who would later become [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]), a Holocaust survivor who works as a volunteer in the clinic, and [[Gabrielle Haller]], a woman driven into a catatonic coma by the trauma she experienced. Xavier uses his mental powers to break her out of her catatonia and the two fall in love. Xavier and Magneto become good friends, although neither immediately reveals to the other that he is a mutant. The two hold lengthy debates hypothesizing what will happen if humanity is faced with a new super-powered race of humans. While Xavier is optimistic, Magneto's experiences in the Holocaust lead him to believe that humanity will ultimately oppress the new race of humans as they have done with other minorities. The two friends reveal their powers to each other when they fight Nazi [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]] and his [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] agents, who kidnap Gabrielle because she knows the location of their secret cache of gold. Magneto attempts to kill Strucker but Xavier stops him. Realizing that his and Xavier's views on mutant-human relations are incompatible, Magneto leaves with the gold. Charles stays in Israel for some time, but he and Gabrielle separate on good terms, neither knowing that she is pregnant with his son, who grows up to become the mutant [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|Legion]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #161, 321</ref>\n\nIn a strange town near the Himalayas, Xavier encounters an alien calling himself [[Lucifer (Marvel Comics)|Lucifer]], the advance scout for an invasion by his race, and foils his plans. In retaliation, Lucifer drops a huge stone block on Xavier, crippling his legs.<ref>''X-Men'' #20</ref> After Lucifer leaves, a young woman named [[Sage (comics)|Sage]] hears Xavier's telepathic cries for help and rescues him, bringing him to safety, beginning a long alliance between the two.<ref>''X-Treme X-Men'' #44</ref>\n\nIn a hospital in India, he is brought to an American nurse, [[Amelia Voght]], who looks after him and, as she sees to his recovery, they fall in love. When he is released from the hospital, the two moved into an apartment in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] together. Amelia is troubled to find Charles studying mutation, as she is a mutant and unsettled by it, though she calms when he reveals himself to be a mutant as well. They eventually move to the United States, living on Xavier's family estate. But the night [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Scott Summers]] moves into Xavier's mansion, Amelia leaves him, believing Charles would have changed his view and that mutants should lie low. Yet he is recruiting them to what she believes is a lost cause. Charles tries to force her to stay with his mental powers, but immediately ashamed by this, lets her go. She later becomes a disciple of Magneto.<ref>''X-Men'' #39-42</ref><ref name = \"idwhkk\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #309</ref><ref name = \"cgvzxf\">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #25</ref>\n\nOver the years, Charles makes a name for himself as [[geneticist]] and psychologist, apparently renowned enough that the Greys were referred to him when no other expert could help their [[catatonic]] daughter, [[Jean Grey|Jean]]. Xavier trains her in the use of her [[telekinesis]], while inhibiting her [[telepathy|telepathic]] abilities until she matures.<ref>''Bizarre Adventures'' #27</ref> Around this time, he also starts working with fellow mutation expert, [[Karl Lykos]], as well as Moira MacTaggert again, who built a mutant research station on [[Muir Island]].

In addition, he seeks to foster mutant-human relations by providing his superhero team, the X-Men, as an example of mutants acting in good faith, as he told [[FBI]] agent [[Fred Duncan (comics)|Fred Duncan]].<ref>''X-Men'' #38</ref> With his inherited fortune, he uses his [[X-Mansion|ancestral mansion]] at 1407 Graymalkin Lane in [[North Salem, New York#Communities and locations in North Salem|Salem Center]], [[Westchester County]], [[New York (state)|New York]] as a base of operations with technologically advanced facilities, including the [[Danger Room]] - later, [[Fantomex]] mentions that Xavier is a billionaire with a net worth of $3.5 billion.<ref>''New X-Men'' #129</ref> Presenting the image of a stern teacher, Xavier makes his students endure a rigorous training regime.<ref>''X-Men'' #1-6, 11</ref>\n\nXavier's first five students are [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], and [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], who become the original X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #46, 56, 53</ref> After he completes recruiting the original team of X-Men, he sends them into battle with Magneto.<ref>''X-Men''#1</ref>\n\nThroughout most of his time with the team, Xavier uses his telepathic powers to keep in constant contact with his students and provides instructions and advice when needed.

The X-Men dispatch them, but Trask sees the error in his ways too late as he is killed by his creations.<ref>''X-Men'' #14-16</ref>\n\nAt one point, Xavier seemingly dies during the X-Men's battle with the sub-human [[Grotesk (comics)|Grotesk]], but it is later revealed that Xavier arranged for a reformed former villain named [[Changeling (Marvel Comics)|Changeling]] to impersonate him while he went into hiding to plan a defense against an invasion by the extraterrestrial Z'Nox, imparting a portion of his telepathic abilities to the Changeling to complete the disguise.<ref>''X-Men'' #41-42</ref>\n\nWhen the X-Men are captured by the [[Sentience|sentient]] island [[Krakoa]], Xavier assembles a new team to rescue them, including Cyclops' and Havok's long-lost brother, [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]],<ref name=\"Deadly Genesis #1-5\">''[[Deadly Genesis]]'' #1-5</ref> along with [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], [[Petra (comics)|Petra]], and [[Sway (comics)|Sway]]. This new team, composed of students of [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]], was sent to rescue the original X-Men from Krakoa. However, after rescuing Cyclops, McTaggert's former students were seemingly killed. Upon Cyclops' return, Xavier removed Cyclops' memories of the death of Vulcan and his teammates; and began assembling yet another team of X-Men.\n\nXavier's subsequent rescue team consists of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Sunfire (comics)|Sunfire]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Thunderbird (comics)|Thunderbird]]. After the mission, the older team of X-Men, except for Cyclops, leave the school, believing they no longer belong there, and Xavier mentors the new X-Men.<ref>''Giant Size X-Men'' #1</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #94-95</ref>\n\nXavier forms a psychic bond across galaxies with Princess [[Lilandra]] from the [[Shi'ar]] Empire. When they finally meet, it is love at first sight. She implores the professor to stop her mad brother, Shi'ar Emperor [[D'Ken]], and he instantly aids her by deploying his X-Men. When Jean Grey returns from the Savage Land to tell him that all the X-Men are dead, he shuts down the school and travels with Lilandra to her kingdom, where she is crowned Empress and he is treated like a child or a trophy husband.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #105-109, 114, 117-118</ref><ref>''Classic X-Men'' #31</ref>\n\nXavier senses the changes taking place in Jean Grey, and returns to Earth to help and resume leadership of the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #129</ref> Shortly thereafter he battles his pupil after she becomes [[Dark Phoenix]] and destroys a populated planet in the Shi'ar Empire. It hurts Xavier to be on the opposite side of Lilandra, but he has no other choice but to challenge the Shi'ar Imperial Guard to a duel over the fate of the Phoenix. Xavier would have lost against the greater power of the Dark Phoenix, but thanks to the help Jean Grey gives him (fighting her Phoenix persona), Xavier emerges victorious; she later commits suicide in order to prevent herself from endangering more innocent lives.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #129; ''See [[Dark Phoenix Saga]]''.</ref>\n\nWhen the X-Men fight members of the extraterrestrial race known as the [[Brood (comics)|Brood]], Xavier is captured by them, and implanted with a Brood egg, which places Xavier under the Brood's control. During this time, Xavier assembles a team of younger mutants called the [[New Mutants]], secretly intended to be prime hosts for reproduction of the aliens. The X-Men discover this and return to free Xavier, but they are too late to prevent his body from being destroyed with a Brood Queen in its place; however, his soul remains intact. The X-Men and [[Starjammers]] subdue this monstrous creature containing Xavier's essence, but the only way to restore him is to clone a new body using tissue samples he donated to the Starjammers and transfer his consciousness into the clone body. This new body possesses functional legs, though the [[psychosomatic]] pain Xavier experienced after living so long as a paraplegic takes some time to subside. Subsequently, he even joins the X-Men in the field, but later decides not to continue this practice after realizing that his place is at the school, as the teacher of the New Mutants.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #154\u2013158, 161, 167, 184</ref><ref>''Marvel Graphic Novel'' #4</ref><ref>''New Mutants'' #1\u20133</ref><ref>''Secret Wars'' #12</ref>\n\nAfter taking a teaching position at [[Columbia University]] in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #192, Xavier is severely injured and left for dead as the victim of a [[hate crime]]. [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]] and her [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], a group of underground-dwelling mutants, get him to safety. One of the Morlocks partially restores Xavier's health, but Callisto warns Xavier that he is not fully healed and that he must spend more time recuperating and restrain himself from exerting his full strength or powers, or his health might fail again. Xavier hides his injuries from the others and resumes his life.<ref name = \"xaqplc\"/>\n\nCharles meets with former lover [[Gabrielle Haller]] on Muir Isle and discovers that they had a child. The boy, [[Legion (Marvel Comics)|David]], is [[autistic]] and suffers from [[multiple personality disorder]] and has vast psionic powers like his father. After helping him and his team to escape from David's mind, Xavier promises he will always be there for him.<ref>''New Mutants'' #26-28</ref>\n\nA reformed Magneto is arrested and put on trial. Xavier attends the trial to defend his friend. [[Fenris (comics)|Andrea and Andreas Strucker]], the children of presumed dead Baron von Strucker, crash the courtroom to attack Magneto and Xavier. Xavier is seriously injured. Dying, he asks a shocked Magneto to look after the X-Men for him. Lilandra, who has a psychic bond with Xavier, feels that he is in great danger and heads to Earth. There, she and [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]] take Xavier with them so [[Shi'ar]] advanced technology can heal him.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #199-200</ref>\n\nXavier leaves Magneto in charge of the school, but some of the X-Men are unwilling to forgive their former enemy. Cyclops loses a duel for the leadership of the X-Men against Storm, then leaves them and joins the other four original X-Men to form a new team called [[X-Factor (comics)|X-Factor]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #201</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, Charles becomes stranded in space with the Starjammers, but he is reunited with his lover Lilandra and relishes his carefree lifestyle. He serves as a member of the Starjammers aboard the starship ''Starjammer'', mobile in the Shi'ar Galaxy. He becomes consort to the Princess-Majestrix Lilandra while in exile, and when she later resumes her throne he takes up residence with her in the Imperial palace on the Shi'ar homeworld. Xavier joins Lilandra in her cause to overthrow her sister [[Deathbird]], taking on the powers of Phoenix temporarily wherein he is named Bald Phoenix by Corsair, but sees that he must return to help the X-Men.<ref>''New Mutants'' #50-51</ref><ref>''X-Men: Spotlight on...

Xavier breaks free from imprisonment by Warskrull Prime, and is reunited with the X-Men.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #277</ref> A healthy Xavier returns from the Shi'ar Empire and is reunited with both the current and original X-Men teams, and resumes his leadership responsibilities of the united teams. In a battle with his old foe, the [[Shadow King]], in the \"[[Muir Island Saga]]\", Xavier's spine is shattered, returning him to his former paraplegic state, while his son David is seemingly killed. In the following months, Xavier rebuilds the mansion, which previously was rebuilt with Shi'ar technology, and restructures the X-Men into two teams.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #278-280</ref><ref>''X-Factor'' #69-70</ref><ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #1-3</ref>\n\nWhile holding a mutant rights speech, Xavier is nearly assassinated by [[Stryfe]] in the guise of [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], being infected with a fatal [[Legacy Virus|techno-organic virus]]. For reasons of his own, the villain [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] saves him. As a temporary side-effect, he gains full use of his legs and devotes his precious time to the youngest recruit on his team, [[Jubilee (comics)|Jubilee]].<ref>''X-Cutioner's Song crossover''</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #297</ref>\n\nWith all his students now highly trained adults, Professor Xavier renames his school the Xavier Institute For Higher Learning. Also, he assumes control of a private institution, the Massachusetts Academy, making it a new School for Gifted Youngsters. Another group of young mutants is trained here, [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]], with Banshee and [[Emma Frost]] as headmaster and headmistress, respectively.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #318-319</ref>\n\nProfessor X is for a time the unknowing host of the evil psionic entity [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]], the result of a previous battle with Magneto.

After the battle, the [[United Nations|UN]] concedes [[Genosha]] to Magnus, and Wolverine is angered by Xavier stopping him from getting his revenge on Magneto.

After Apocalypse's defeat with the help of [[Skrull]] mutants, Xavier goes with the young Skrulls known as Cadre K to train them and free them from their oppressors, and eventually returns to aid in [[Legacy Virus]] research.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2, #90</ref><ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #379</ref><ref>''Maximum Security crossover''</ref><ref name = \"hxotox\">''Dream's End crossover''</ref>\n\n[[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and her Brotherhood start a deadly assault on Muir Isle by releasing an altered form of the Legacy Virus, all in retaliation against the election campaign of [[Robert Kelly (comics)|Robert Kelly]], a seeming mutant-hater. Mystique blows up Moira MacTaggert's laboratory complex, fatally wounding her. Charles goes to the astral plane to meet with her and retrieve information on the cure to the Legacy Virus, but after gathering the information does not want to leave her alone. If not for Jean and Cable talking him down and pulling him back, the professor would have died with his first love, who states she has no regrets.<ref name = \"hxotox\"/>\n\nAs [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] cures the Legacy Virus, many infected Genoshan mutants recover overnight, providing Magneto, the current ruler of Genosha, with an army to start the third World War. He demands Earth's governments accept him as their leader, and abducts and crucifies Xavier in Magda Square for all to see. A loyal member of Magneto's [[Acolytes (comics)|Acolytes]], Amelia Voght, can't stand to see her former lover punished in such a manner and sets him free.

The X-Men restore Xavier, but Lilandra, believing that too much disaster has come from the Shi'ar's involvement with the X-Men, annuls her marriage to Xavier. Lilandra previously had gone insane and tried to assassinate Charles on a trip to [[Mumbai]]. During this period, a mutant named [[Xorn]] joins the X-Men. Xorn uses his healing power to restore Xavier's use of his legs.<ref>''New X-Men'' #114-117, #121-126, #133</ref>\n\nWhen the X-Men receive a distress call from a Scottish island, they are surprised to find Juggernaut with nowhere to go, as the island was destroyed by his further-mutated partner in crime, [[Black Tom Cassidy]], who died. Xavier reaches out to his stepbrother and offers him a place in his mansion, with Cain reluctantly accepting. The Juggernaut redeems himself over the next few weeks and joins the X-Men. Xavier finds out that Cain's father preferred him to his own flesh and blood and that they both thought they deserved the abuse they incurred by Kurt; Cain believed this because his father loved someone else's child more than him, and Charles felt guilty about getting in the way. That it is why neither of them stopped Kurt Marko with their powers.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #411-412, 429</ref>\n\nNow outed as a mutant, Xavier makes speeches to the public about mutant tolerance. He also founds the X-Corporation, or X-Corp (not to be confused with the [[X-Corps]]), with offices all over the world. The purpose of the X-Corp is to watch over mutant rights and help mutants in need. As a result of being out, the school no longer hides the fact that it is a school for mutants and it opens its doors for more mutant (and even human) students to come in. A student named [[Quentin Quire]] and members of his gang start a riot at the Xavier Institute during an open house at the school. As a result, Quire and two other students are killed. Uncertain about his dream's validity, Xavier announces that he will step down as headmaster and be succeeded by Jean Grey. Afterwards, Xorn reveals himself to be Magneto, having apparently not died in the Sentinel raid on Genosha. Magneto undoes the restoration of Xavier's ability to walk, kidnaps him, and destroys the X-Mansion (killing several of the students). Then Xorn/Magneto assaults New York, where Cyclops, Fantomex and a few students confront him. After the rest of the X-Men arrive, Xorn/Magneto kills Jean Grey with an electromagnetically induced stroke, and Wolverine decapitates him. With Jean dead, Xavier leaves the school to Cyclops and Emma Frost, to bury Xorn/Magneto in Genosha.<ref>''New X-Men'' #128-132, 135-138, 146-150</ref> In a retcon of Grant Morrison's storyline, there Xavier meets the \"real\" Magneto, who mysteriously survived Cassandra Nova's assault. The two resolve their differences and attempt to restore their friendship, leading a team of mutants, the Genoshan Excalibur, to rebuild and restore order to the destroyed island nation.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 2 #1-8</ref>\n\nAt the mansion, the Danger Room (the X-Men\u2019s [[simulated reality]] training chamber) gains [[sentience]], christens itself \"Danger\", assumes a humanoid form, and attacks the X-Men before leaving to kill Xavier. With Magneto's help, Xavier holds off Danger until the X-Men arrive. Danger flees, but not before revealing to Colossus that Xavier has known it to be sentient ever since he upgraded it. Colossus is especially offended by this because he had been held captive and experimented upon by Danger's ally, [[Ord (comics)|Ord]] of the Breakworld. Ashamed, Xavier tries to explain to them that by the time he realized what was happening, he could see no other course. The disgusted X-Men leave.<ref>''Excalibur'' vol. 2 #9-10</ref><ref>''New X-Men'' 155-156</ref><ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' vol. 3 #7, 9-12</ref>\n\nIn a prelude to ''[[House of M]]'', Magneto's daughter [[Scarlet Witch]] suffers a mental breakdown and [[Avengers Disassembled|causes the death of several Avengers]]. Magneto brings her to Xavier and asks him to use his mental powers to help her. Although aided by [[Doctor Strange]] and the appearance of Cassandra Nova, Xavier is unsuccessful. Xavier orders a meeting of the X-Men and Avengers to decide Wanda's fate.<ref>''[[House of M]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]]</ref> Her brother [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], believing the heroes plan to kill her, speeds off to Genosha and convinces Wanda that she could right the wrongs she inflicted by using her powers to alter reality.\n\nQuicksilver somehow forces a tearful Wanda to reveal to him her heart's desires of Magneto, the assembled New Avengers, and the X-Men, and then uses her powers to make them all real. Thanks to Magneto, though, this re-imagined world is a place where a much more numerous mutant-kind are the dominant species, humans a disenfranchised and oppressed 'silent majority', and Magneto himself rules supreme. In this reality, the only proof that Charles Xavier ever existed is a secret monument in Magneto's palace garden, with the engraved message \"He died so Genosha could live\".\n\nAfter mutant [[Layla Miller]] restores the memories of some of the X-Men and Avengers, they head to Genosha where they discover that Magneto has erected a memorial garden for Xavier commemorating his death. Emma is horrified until [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] fades into the grave and discovers there is no body inside. After a battle, Scarlet Witch again uses her powers to restore reality and, as a slight against her father, causes a large majority mutants to [[Decimation (comics)|lose their powers]], leaving the mutant race on the brink of extinction and causing the lost powers to become an energy mass, [[The Collective (comics)|the Collective]]. With reality restored, Xavier is still missing and the X-Men are unable to detect him with Cerebro<ref>''House of M #1-8</ref>''.\n\nXavier returns when Cyclops' and Havok's long-lost brother, [[Vulcan (Marvel Comics)|Vulcan]],<ref name=\"Deadly Genesis #1-5\"/> is revived by the Collective energy released as a result of the \"House of M\" incident. Vulcan then attacks the X-Men. Xavier, now depowered but able to walk in the wake of \"House of M\", reveals that he had gathered and trained another team of X-Men (this one composed of students of [[Moira MacTaggert|Dr. Moira MacTaggert]]) sometime between the original team and the new X-Men team introduced in ''Giant Size X-Men'' #1. This team included Vulcan as a member. Like the \"Giant Size\" X-Men team, McTaggert's former students were sent to rescue the original X-Men from Krakoa, the living island. However, after rescuing Cyclops, McTaggert's former students were seemingly killed. Upon Cyclops' return, Xavier removed Cyclops' memories of the death of Vulcan and his teammates and began assembling the \"Giant Size\" X-Men. Vulcan skirmishes with the X-Men and eventually flees into space.\n\nIn spite of Cyclops' feelings, Xavier forms a new team including [[Havok (comics)|Havok]] and [[Darwin (comics)|Darwin]], the lone other survivors of Moira's students.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #475</ref> Xavier seeks to confront Vulcan before he can enact his vengeance against the Shi'ar empire, which killed Vulcan's mother. While en route to the Shi'ar homeworld, Xavier is abducted and is later thrown into the [[M'Kraan Crystal]] by Vulcan. Darwin follows Xavier into the crystal and pulls Xavier out. This somehow restores Xavier's lost telepathy. With help from his longtime lover, Lilandra, Xavier escapes back to Earth with several of his X-Men.\n\nUpon Xavier's return to Earth, as seen in the ''[[World War Hulk]]'' storyline, he begins to search for lost mutants such as Magneto. Charles' search for more mutants is interrupted by the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]], who was sent into extraterrestrial exile by [[Illuminati (comics)|the Illuminati]], a group of powerful superbeings to which Xavier belongs. Xavier had no part in (and did not know of) the Hulk exile decision, but Xavier admits to Hulk that he would have concurred to a temporary exile so [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]] could be cured of transforming into the Hulk. However, he also tells the Hulk he would not have agreed to permanent exile. Xavier attempts to surrender to the Hulk, but after viewing the X-Mansion's large graveyard dedicated to post-M-Day mutant deaths, The Hulk concludes the mutants have suffered enough and leaves the Mansion grounds on his own accord. While the X-Men tend to the wounded, Cyclops finally forgives Professor X.\n\nWhile using [[Cerebra (Marvel Comics feature)|Cerebra]] and talking to Beast during the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' storyline, Charles detects a new mutant so powerful it fries Cerebra's system. He asks Cyclops to send out a team to find out about the mutant. Once the team has come back empty handed, he argues with Scott for not telling him about the team he deployed to find former Acolytes. Scott tells him outright that he doesn't need him to run the X-Men anymore.<ref>''X-Factor v2 26'' (2008)</ref> This upsets Charles and annoys him later on when he overhears Cyclops briefing X-Factor on the situation.{{Issue|date=August 2010}} He also approaches the [[New X-Men]] in an attempt to help them figure out a non-violent way to help against the Purifiers, but is quickly rebuked by [[Surge (comics)|Surge]], who questions where he was when they were getting attacked the first time, and that they didn't need to learn from him. Charles questions Cyclops' decision to send X-Force to hunt down his own son, Cable, in front of the students. Cyclops then tells Xavier that he is a distraction that will keep getting in the way and that he must leave the mansion. Xavier is contacted by [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who lost the mutant newborn to the traitorous actions of [[Bishop (comics)|Bishop]], who in turn lost the child to the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]], and tells him that he is the only one who can help Cable save the future.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men #494''</ref> In the final fight, Xavier is accidentally shot in the head by Bishop. Immediately afterward Xavier's body disappears and Cyclops declares that there are no more X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #207 - Messiah Complex</ref>\n\nProfessor Xavier survives Bishop's gunshot but falls into a coma.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #208</ref> Xavier is kidnapped by Exodus, Tempo, and [[Karima Shapandar]]. Exodus tries to heal Xavier, Xavier mentally fights Exodus. Exodus finally approaches Magneto, who is apparently still depowered, for help. Magneto and Karima Shapandar are able to stir Xavier's memories and coax him out of his coma, though Xavier remains slightly confused and partly amnesiac. Later, Exodus confronts Magneto about [[Joanna Cargill]]'s injury (Magneto was forced to shoot a laser through her eyeball in order to prevent her attempted an assassination of Xavier). Exodus nearly kills Magneto, and Xavier drags Exodus onto the Astral Plane, putting Xavier's own newly restored mind at stake. Xavier defeats Exodus after a harrowing psionic battle, and Exodus reveals the reason he abducted Xavier and to restore his mind: Exodus wants Xavier to lead the Acolytes and find the mutant messiah child (now under the guardianship of Cable) in order to indoctrinate the child into their cause. Xavier refuses. [[Emma Frost]]'s telepathy picks up on the psychic fight, and Emma informs Cyclops that Xavier is alive. Xavier parts company with Magneto and Karima to try to regain his lost memories by visiting people from his past.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #210\">''X-Men Legacy'' #210</ref>\n\nThe first person Charles visits is Carter Ryking, who had gone insane after losing his powers. Charles reads Carter's memories and discovers that when the two were children they were used as test subjects by [[Mister Sinister|Nathan Milbury]] of the Black Womb Project, with the approval of Charles' father, Doctor Brian Xavier. Xavier makes the connection Milbury and X-Men villain, [[Mister Sinister]], who has apparently long been manipulating Charles' life in addition to other X-Men. Afterwards, he discovers he has been targeted by assassins.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #211\">''X-Men Legacy'' #211</ref>\n\nCharles eventually discovers Mister Sinister had set up Charles, Sebastian Shaw, Juggernaut, and Ryking (Hazard) as potential new hosts for Sinister's mind.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #210\"/> Bleeding slowly to death, he apparently gives in to Sinister becoming the new Mister Sinister. But in reality, Xavier is still battling Sinister for control of his body.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #210\"/> As Sebastian Shaw and Gambit destroy Sinister's Cronus Machine, the device that he used to transfer his consciousness into new hosts, Xavier drives Sinister out of his body permanently.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #211\"/> Xavier thanks Shaw and Gambit for their help and declares he must go and see Cyclops immediately.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #214\">''X-Men Legacy'' #214</ref> Professor X returns to the X-Mansion to find it destroyed after recent events.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #214\"/> Afterwards, Xavier leaves the ruins of the X-Mansion to secretly meet up Cyclops by psychically coercing his former student for the visit. Xavier explains to Cyclops about the recent events with Mr. Sinister and tries to explain to Cyclops how Sinister has been manipulating Scott's and Jean's lives since when they were children. Xavier attempts to have Scott give him permission to scan Scott's mind for traces of Sinister's influences, but instead, Scott turns the tables on Xavier by revealing that he has secretly invited Emma Frost into their entire meeting and also into Xavier's mind.<ref>\"X-Men Legacy\" #215</ref>\n\nWhile in his mind, Emma forces Xavier to relive each of his morally ambiguous decisions under altruistic pretenses. As the issue continues, Charles realizes his human arrogance and that while some of his decisions were morally wrong, he must move forward with his life and deal with the consequences. Emma ends her incursion into Xavier's mind by reminding him of Moira MacTaggert's last words. As he reflects on Moira's words, Xavier gives Cyclops his blessing to lead the X-Men and leaves to find his own path.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #216</ref> Following his encounter with Wolverine (in the \"Original Sin\" Arc) Professor Xavier seeks out his step-brother, the unstoppable Juggernaut in an attempt to reform him. After a conversation about the meaning of the word \"Juggernaut\" and a review of Juggernaut and Xavier's shared history Xavier offers Cain an empty box as a gift. Confused by Xavier's gift Cain attempts to kill the Professor bringing an entire sports bar down over their heads in the process. Later Cain battles the X-Men in his full Juggernaut armor and conquers the planet. Just as everything appears to be under the Juggernaut's control Xavier reappears and informs him that everything that has just taken place except for Juggernaut destroying the bar took place in Cain's mind. A baffled Cain demands to know how Xavier managed to overcome his psychically shielded helmet to which the Professor replies that he decided to visit Cain in his sleep. Professor Xavier then informs him that he now understands Cain as a person and that he will not attempt to get in his way or reform him again. But Xavier also warns Cain that if he gets in the way of the Professor's path to redemption Xavier will stop him permanently.<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #219</ref> Following his encounter with Cain it has been revealed that Xavier is now searching for Rogue.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #220\">''X-Men Legacy'' #220</ref>\n\nAfter his bruising encounter with Cyclops and Emma Frost, Professor X is forced to revisit the biggest challenge and the biggest failure of his career, Wolverine, when the feral mutant asks for Charles' help in freeing his son from the clutches of the Hellfire Club. As the two search for Daken, Wolverine reveals that when he first joined the X-Men he attempted to assassinate Xavier due to some unknown programming. In response, the Professor broke Logan's mind and rebuilt it so that any and all programming he received was forgotten. Logan also revealed that the real reason Xavier asked him to join the X-Men was that Charles \"needed a weapon\".<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #217</ref> Eventually Professor Xavier and Wolverine locate Sebastian Shaw's mansion and attack his minions, just as they are about to enter a bomb explodes from within catching them both off guard. From the wreckage emerges an angry Sebastian who immobilizes Wolverine. Meanwhile, Miss Sinister knocks [[Daken]] unconscious and has him taken to the med lab in the mansion's basement. As Shaw prepares to deliver a killing blow to Xavier, Wolverine recovers and stops him telling Xavier to rescue his son. Professor Xavier locates the med lab and after a quick psychic battle with Miss Sinister enters Daken's fractured mind. While in Daken's mind Xavier discovers Romulus's psychic tampering and comments that Daken's mind is even more broken than Wolverine's was. Before Xavier can heal Daken a psychic bomb explodes causing Xavier to become comatose and Daken to wake up. Miss Sinister arrives and attempts to manipulate Daken who reveals that the psychic bomb in his head restored his memories and stabs Miss Sinister in the chest. Meanwhile, Wolverine defeats Shaw and enters the mansion to find Daken standing over an unconscious Xavier preparing to kill him.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #218</ref> Wolverine tells Daken that he won't let him hurt Xavier and the two fight. Overcome with guilt over what happened to Daken and Itsu, Wolverine allows himself to be beaten. Just as Daken appears to have won Xavier pulls both of them onto the astral plane revealing that the psychic bomb had little effect on him because his psyche was already shattered. Xavier then explains to Wolverine and Daken that Romulus is solely responsible for Itsu's death and that he lied to Daken about everything because he wanted Wolverine to become his weapon. As the three converse, Daken returns to the physical plane and prevents Shaw from killing Xavier. With the truth revealed Wolverine and Daken decide to kill Romulus. As the two depart Wolverine tells Xavier that he forgives him for all of the dark moments in their history. Wolverine acknowledges that Professor Xavier allowed him to become a hero. Wolverine then tells the Professor that he hopes he will one day be able to forgive him for choosing to kill Romulus.<ref>''Wolverine: Origins'' #30</ref>\n\nProfessor Xavier recruits [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]] to go with him to [[Australia]] to find and help Rogue who is currently staying at the X-Men's old base in the Outback; unaware Danger is using Rogue as a conduit for her revenge against him.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #220\"/>\n\nIn a prelude to the \"[[Secret Invasion]]\" storyline, Professor X was at the meeting of the Illuminati when it came to the discussion about the Skrulls planning an invasion by taking out Earth's heroes and posing as them. He claims he was unable to distinguish that [[Black Bolt]] had been replaced by a [[Skrull]], and his powers were tested quickly by the Black Bolt Skrull. Professor X leaves after learning even he can no longer trust the others, yet appears to have severely restricted the number of people he informs of the forthcoming alien invasion, as the X-Men were not prepared for the Skrulls, at least at first.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>  Xavier has not seen again during the events of ''Secret Invasion'', though his X-Men in San Francisco are successful at repelling the invaders there through the use of the modified Legacy Virus.\n\nDuring the ''[[Dark Reign (comics)|Dark Reign]]'' storyline, Professor X convinces Exodus to disband the Acolytes. A [[H.A.M.M.E.R.]] helicopter arrives and from inside appears [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]], who wants to talk to him.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' #225. Marvel Comics.</ref>  During the [[Dark Avengers]]' arrival in San Francisco to enforce martial law and squelch the anti-mutant riots occurring in the city, Xavier appears (back in his wheelchair) in the company of Norman Osborn and publicly denounces Cyclops' actions and urges him to turn himself in. However, this Xavier was revealed to be [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] who Osborn recruited to impersonate Xavier in public.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #513\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #513. Marvel Comics.</ref>  The real Xavier is shown in prison on Alcatraz and slowly being stripped of his telepathic powers while in psionic contact with Beast, who was arrested earlier for his part in the anti-mutant riots.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Utopia'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>  It was also revealed by [[Emma Frost]] that she and Professor X are both Omega Class Telepaths when she manages to detect the real Professor X.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #513\"/> Professor X helps Emma Frost enter Sentry's mind. However, as Emma frees him of the Void's influence, a minute sliver of the entity itself remains in her mind. Xavier quickly tells her to remain in her diamond armor state to prevent the Void from gaining access to her psi-powers. Professor X is later seen with Emma Frost where Beast is recuperating.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus''. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nAfter the events of ''Utopia'', Xavier has come to live on the risen Asteroid M, rechristened Utopia, along with the rest of the X-Men, X-Club, and mutant refugees and is also allowed to join the Utopia lead council (Cyclops, Storm, Namor, Iceman, Beast, Wolverine and Emma Frost). While he no longer continues to openly question every move that Cyclops makes, he is still concerned about some of his leadership decisions. Xavier had wanted to return to the mainland in order to clear his name, but in the aftermath of Osborn declaring Utopia as a mutant detention area, Cyclops refused to let him leave, stating that it would be a tactical advantage to have him as an ace in the hole in case the need arose. To that end, he has kept Xavier out of the field and instead relied on Emma Frost, Psylocke and the Stepford Cuckoos respectively for their own psionic talents.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #515. Marvel Comics.</ref>  While attending the funeral of Yuriko Takiguchi, Magneto arrives at Utopia, apparently under peaceful motives. Xavier does not believe it, and attacks Magneto telepathically, causing Cyclops to force him to stand down.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #516. Marvel Comics.</ref>  He later apologizes to Magneto for acting out of his old passions from their complicated relationship, which Magneto accepts.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #520. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]]'' storyline, Professor Xavier is seen on Utopia delivering a eulogy at Nightcrawler's funeral. Like the other X-Men, he is deeply saddened by Kurt's death and anxious about the arrival of Cable and Hope.<ref>''New Mutants'' #13</ref> Xavier is seen using his powers to help his son Legion control his many personalities and battle the Nimrods.<ref>''New Mutants'' #14</ref> At the conclusion of Second Coming Professor X is seen surveying the aftermath of the battle from a helicopter. As Hope descends to the ground and cradles Cable's lifeless arm, Xavier reflects on everything that has transpired and states that, while he feels that Hope has indeed come to save mutant kind and revive his dream, she is still only a young woman and will have a long and difficult journey before she can truly achieve her potential.<ref>''X-Men: Second Coming'' #2</ref>\n\nDuring the \"[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]\" storyline, the Phoenix Force is split into five pieces and bonded with Cyclops, Emma Frost, Namor, Colossus and Magik (who become known as the Phoenix Five).<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, Cyclops and Frost come to possess the full Phoenix Force, and Professor X is instrumental in confronting them both, and dies in the ensuing battle with Cyclops.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Phoenix Force is subsequently forced to abandon Cyclops as a host by the efforts of both Hope Summers and the Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Avengers vs. X-Men'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nXavier's body is later stolen by the [[Red Skull]]'s [[S-Men]] while the group also captures Rogue and Scarlet Witch.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Xavier's brain is removed and fused to the brain of the Red Skull. After Rogue and Scarlet Witch snapped out of the fight they were in, they find the lobotomized body of Professor X.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #2</ref> Red Skull uses the new powers conferred upon him by Professor X's brain to provoke anti-mutant riots. His plans are foiled by the Avengers and the X-Men,<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the Skull escapes.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nProfessor X's spirit is later seen in the Heaven dimension along with Nightcrawler's spirit at the time when Azazel invades Heaven.<ref>''Amazing X-Men'' vol. 2 #5</ref>\n\nDuring the ''[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]'' storyline, a fragment of Professor X's psyche (which had escaped the scrubbing of his memories) still existed in Red Skull's mind preventing him from unleashing the full potential of Professor X's powers.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #24</ref> During a fight with the Stark Sentinels, Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch attempt to cast a spell to invert the axis of Red Skull's brain and bring out the fragment of Professor X to defeat Onslaught. Doctor Strange was targeted and captured by the Sentinels before they could cast the spell.<ref name=\"Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #2\">''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2</ref> When Magneto arrived with his supervillain allies, Doctor Doom and Scarlet Witch attempted to cast the inversion spell again and Red Onslaught was knocked unconscious and reverted to his Red Skull form. Although they did not know whether Professor X was now in control, the Avengers decided to be cautious and take Red Skull to Stark Tower.<ref name=\"Avengers & X-Men: AXIS #2\"/> It was later revealed that the spell had actually caused all the heroes and villains present to undergo a \"moral inversion\" rather than simply bringing out Professor X in the Skull, with the result that the Skull and other villains became heroic while the Avengers and X-Men present became villainous.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #3</ref> Eventually, the inversion was undone.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #9</ref> \n\nAfter the Skull mounts a telepathic assault that nearly allows him to take control of the Avengers, he is defeated when Deadpool places Magneto's old helmet on Rogue, allowing her to knock out the Skull and take him to Beast.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol.2 #21</ref> Beast is subsequently able to perform brain surgery on the Skull, extracting the part of Xavier's brain that was grafted onto the villain's own brain without causing any apparent damage to the Skull. Rogers attempts to claim the fragment for himself, but Rogue flies up and incinerates the fragment with the aid of the [[Human Torch]], the two expressing hope that Xavier will rest in peace.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' vol. 2 #22</ref>\n\nThe astral form of Professor Xavier has since been revealed to be imprisoned in the Astral Plane after Shadow King somehow acquired it upon Professor X's death.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #01</ref> After what appeared to be years in the Astral Plane, Professor X is able to trick Shadow King into playing him in a 'game' that lures Rogue, Mystique and Fantomex onto the Astral Plane,<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' Vol. 4 #5</ref> while turning others into carriers for the Shadow King's 'contagious' psychic essence. With the Shadow King certain of his victory, he fails to realize that Xavier's apparent 'surrender' to his game was really just him biding his time until the Shadow King's influence was distracted long enough for him to drop his already-subtly-weakened guard long enough for Xavier to break his bonds, luring in the three aforementioned X-Men as their identities were already fundamentally malleable. With the Shadow King defeated, Xavier is apparently returned to the real world in the body of Fantomex, Fantomex reasoning that nobody really knows who he is as an individual beyond his status as one of the X-Men whereas this act of sacrifice will ensure that he is remembered for a great deed.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' Vol. 4 #6</ref>\n\nProteus has spent years trapped in a psionic hellscape of the Astral Plane, where The Shadow King reigned surpreme, only to escape last issue. Part of the reason that he could was the escape of Charles Xavier (who now chooses to go by X, since he is now in a younger body after escaping), and now X leads the X-Men directly into an ambush, as Proteus has warped an entire village with his powers, leading to a mind-to-mind battle that leaves X on the receiving end of a psychic beatdown.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' Vol. 4 #10</ref>\n\nProteus has started his garden and his seeds are planted all over the world. Psylocke is in command and has a plan which mainly consists of Archangel using metal and Mystique morphing into his mother. Once they drain him, Rogue and Bishop convert his energy and release him back to the universe. Whilst this all went down Psylocke and X combined forces to burn out the seeds across the planet. As they are working on it they discover they are not enough to accomplish the task. X mentions the network of psychics the Shadow King was using and that Betsy who is in control should tap into it. She agrees and does so yet unbeknownst to her X was possessed by the Shadow King who violently erupts from X's head.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' Vol. 4 #11</ref>\n\nFollowing X\u2019s apparent death after the Shadow King exploded from his skull, the psychic villain tears the X-Men apart until X literally pulls himself back together (a feat he later refuses to explain), and he and Psylocke team up to harness the power of all of Earth\u2019s psychics to destroy the Shadow King. As Psylocke says she feels no psychic trace of him anywhere, X implants comforting post-hypnotic psychic suggestions in his allies and then erases their memories (including allowing Warren Worthington to switch between his identities at will). Only Psylocke\u2019s memory is left intact, with X telling her she\u2019ll be the one to \u201ckeep him honest\u201d while he embarks on a new mission.<ref>''Astonishing X-Men'' Vol. 4 #12</ref>\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n[[File:Cerebro (Marvel Comics device).png|thumb|upright|[[Cerebro]] in ''X-Men'' #7 (September 1964). Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]\nProfessor X is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses vast telepathic powers, and is among the strongest and most powerful telepaths in the [[Marvel Universe]]. He is able to perceive the thoughts of others or project his own thoughts within a radius of approximately {{convert|250|mi|km|-1}}. Xavier's telepathy once covered the entire world; although following this, Magneto altered the Earth's electromagnetic field to restrict Xavier's telepathic range.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #145</ref> While not on Earth, Xavier's natural telepathic abilities have reached across space to make universal mental contact with multiple alien races.<ref>''Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet''</ref> With extreme effort, he can also greatly extend the range of his telepathy. He can learn foreign languages by reading the language centers of the brain of someone adept, and alternately \"teach\" languages to others in the same manner. Xavier once trained a new group of mutants mentally, subjectively making them experience months of training together, while only hours passed in the real world.<ref>''X-Men: Deadly Genesis''</ref>\n\nXavier's vast psionic powers enable him to manipulate the minds of others, warp perceptions to make himself seem invisible, project mental illusions, cause loss of particular memories or total amnesia, and induce pain or temporary mental and/or physical paralysis in others. Within close range, he can manipulate almost any number of minds for such simple feats. However, he can only take full possession of one other mind at a time, and must strictly be within that person's physical presence. He is one of the few telepaths skilled enough to communicate with animals and even share their perceptions.<ref name=\"X-Men Legacy #211\">''X-Men Legacy'' #211</ref> He can also telepathically take away or control people's natural bodily functions and senses, such as sight, hearing, smell, taste, or even mutant powers. A side effect of his telepathy is that he has an [[eidetic memory]]. He has displayed telepathic prowess sufficient to confront [[Ego the Living Planet]] (while aided by [[Skrull#Cadre K|Cadre K]])<ref>Maximum Security: Dangerous Planet</ref> as well as narrowly defeat [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]].<ref>''X-Men: Legacy'' #210</ref> However, he cannot permanently \"reprogram\" human minds to believe what he might want them to believe even if he wanted to do so, explaining that the mind is an organism that would always recall the steps necessary for it to reach the present and thus 'rewrite' itself to its original setting if he tried to change it.<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #4</ref> However, his initial reprogramming of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] lasted several years, despite Wolverine overcoming the reprogramming much faster than an ordinary human because of his healing factor.<ref>''House of M'' #1</ref>\n\nHe is able to project from his mind 'bolts' composed of psychic energy, enabling him to stun the mind of another person into unconsciousness, inflict mental trauma, or even cause death. These 'bolts' inflict damage only upon other minds, having a negligible effect on non-mental beings, if any. The manner in which Xavier's powers function indicates that his telepathy is physical in some way, as it can be enhanced by physical means (for example, Cerebro), but can also be disrupted by physical means (for example, Magneto's alteration of the Earth's magnetic field).\n\nXavier can perceive the distinct mental presence/brain waves of other superhuman mutants within a small radius of himself. To detect mutants to a wider area beyond this radius, he must amplify his powers through Cerebro and subsequently [[Cerebra (Marvel Comics feature)|Cerebra]], computer devices of his own design which are sensitive to the psychic/physical energies produced by the mind.\n\nProfessor X can project his astral form into a psychic dimension known as the astral plane. There, he can use his powers to create objects, control his surroundings, and even control and destroy the astral forms of others. He cannot project this form over long distances.\n\n''Uncanny X-Men'' writer [[Ed Brubaker]] has claimed that, after being de-powered by the [[Scarlet Witch]],<ref>''[[House of M]]''</ref><ref>''[[Decimation (comics)|Decimation]]''</ref> and then re-powered by the [[M'Kraan Crystal]], Charles' telepathy is more powerful than was previously known. However, the extent of this enhancement is unknown.<ref>''World War Hulk: X-Men'' #1</ref>\n\nCharles Xavier is a genius with multiple [[doctorate]]s. He is a world-renowned geneticist, a leading expert in mutation, possesses considerable knowledge of various [[life science]]s, and is the [[inventor]] of [[Cerebro]].<ref name = \"ydnsmw\"/> He possesses Ph.D.s in Genetics, Biophysics, Psychology, and Anthropology, and an M.D. in Psychiatry. He is highly talented in devising equipment for utilizing and enhancing psionic powers. He is also a great tactician and strategist, effectively evaluating situations and devising swift responses.\n\nDuring his travels in Asia, Xavier learned [[martial arts]], acquiring \"refined combat skills\" according to Magneto. When these skills are coordinated in tandem with his [[telepathic]] abilities, Xavier is a dangerous unarmed combatant, capable of sensing the intentions of others and countering them with superhuman efficiency. He also has extensive knowledge of [[pressure points]].<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #321</ref>\n\nCharles Xavier was also given possession of the Mind [[Infinity Gem]].<ref>''New Avengers: Illuminati'' #2</ref> It allows the user to boost mental power and access the thoughts and dreams of other beings. Backed by the Power Gem, it is possible to access all minds in existence simultaneously. Like all other former Illuminati members, Xavier has sworn to never use the gem and to keep its location hidden.\n\n==Xavier Protocols==\nThe Xavier Protocols are a set of doomsday plans created by Professor X. The protocols detail the best way to kill many powerful mutant characters, including the X-Men and Xavier himself, should they become too large of a danger. The Xavier Protocols are first mentioned during the \"[[Onslaught Saga|Onslaught]]\" [[crossover (comics)|crossover]] and first seen in ''[[Excalibur (comics)|Excalibur]]'' #100 in [[Moira MacTaggert]]'s lab. Charles Xavier compiled a list of the Earth's most powerful mutants and plans on how to defeat them if they become a threat to the world.<ref name=\"Ex100\">''Excalibur'' #100</ref> They are first used after [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] grows too powerful. Only parts of the actual protocols are ever shown. In the \"[[Operation: Zero Tolerance]]\" crossover [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] obtains an encrypted copy of the protocols, intending to use them against the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' vol. 2 #65</ref> However, Cable infiltrates the [[X-Mansion]] and secures all encrypted files before Bastion has a chance to decrypt them.<ref>''Cable'' vol. 2, #46-47</ref> Due to the tampering of Bastion and his [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]], the X-Mansion computer system [[Cerebro]] gains autonomy and seeks to destroy the X-Men by employing its knowledge of the Xavier Protocols. In a virtual environment created by Professor X, Cerebro executes the Xavier Protocols against the X-Men.<ref name=\"Xv.2#84\">''X-Men'' vol. 2 #84</ref>\n\nEach protocol is activated by the presence of a different combination of X-Men and were written by Xavier himself:<ref name=\"Ex100\"/>\n* Code 0-0-0 (Charles Xavier) was activated by Moira MacTaggert, Cyclops, and Jean Grey. This file is both an entry on Charles Xavier, as well as an introduction to the Xavier Protocols. It contained a holographic image of Charles Xavier, reading the following message: \"Moira, Scott, Jean; if you three are seeing these images, then I have become a mortal threat to my X-Men. In this instance, I must be stopped by any means necessary. Some years ago, I made a study of various forms of possible defense against my own psychic abilities. The image next to me is that of an anti-psionic armor. The wearer should be protected from my talent. When I finish speaking, a blueprint for this armor will be downloaded.\"\n* Code 0-2-1 (Wolverine) was activated by [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], Cyclops, and Jean Grey.\n* Code 1-3-9 ([[Cable (comics)|Cable]]) was activated by Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Cannonball.\n\nOther X-Men who have faced their Xavier Protocols are [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]], [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Gambit (comics)|Gambit]].<ref name=\"Xv.2#84\"/>\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Main|Alternative versions of Professor X}}\n\n==In other media==\n{{Main|Professor X in other media}}\n\nProfessor X has appeared on a number of animated television shows including the ''[[X-Men (TV series)|X-Men animated series]]'' voiced by [[Cedric Smith (actor)|Cedric Smith]], ''[[X-Men: Evolution]]'' voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]], and in ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' voiced by [[Jim Ward (voice actor)|Jim Ward]]. \n\nHe has appeared in nine live-action ''X-Men'' feature films to date.

The original right-of-way is now controlled by the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], which bought Southern Pacific in 1996.\n\nThe Union Pacific-Central Pacific (Southern Pacific) mainline followed the historic [[Overland Trail|Overland Route]] from [[Omaha, Nebraska]] to [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nChinese labor was the most vital source for constructing the railroad. Fifty Chinese laborers were hired by the Central Pacific Railroad in February 1865, and soon more and more Chinese men were hired. Working conditions were harsh, and Chinese men were compensated less than their white counterparts. Chinese men were paid thirty-one dollars each month, and while white workers were paid the same, they were also given room and board.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Takaki|first1=Ronald|title=A History of Asian Americans: Strangers From A Different Shore|date=1989|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-316-83130-7|page=84-86|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n==Financing==\n[[File:Central Pacific Railroad First Mortgage Bonds Advertisement 1867.jpg|thumb|right|Advertisement for CPRR First Mortgage Bonds (1867)]]Construction of the road was financed primarily by 30-year, 6% [[United States Treasury security|U.S. government bonds]] authorized by Sec. 5 of the [[Pacific Railway Acts|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]].

When Stanford was Governor of California, the Legislature passed on April 22, 1863, \"An Act to Authorize the Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco to take and subscribe One Million Dollars to the Capital Stock of the Western Pacific Rail Road Company and the Central Pacific Rail Road Company of California and to provide for the payment of the same and other matters relating thereto\" (which was later amended by Section Five of the \"Compromise Act\" of April 4, 1864). On May 19, 1863, the electors of the City and County of San Francisco passed this bond by a vote of 6,329 to 3,116, in a highly controversial Special Election.\n\nThe City and County's financing of the investment through the issuance and delivery of Bonds was delayed for two years, when Mayor [[Henry P. Coon]], and the County Clerk, Wilhelm Loewy, each refused to countersign the Bonds. It took legal actions to force them to do so: in 1864 the Supreme Court of the State of California ordered them under Writs of [[Mandamus]] (''The People of the State of California ''ex rel'' the Central Pacific Railroad Company vs. Henry P. Coon, Mayor; Henry M. Hale, Auditor; and Joseph S. Paxson, Treasurer, of the City and County of San Francisco.'' 25 Cal. 635) and in 1865, a legal judgment against Loewy (''The People ''ex rel'' The Central Pacific Railroad Company of California vs. The Board of Supervisors of the City and County of San Francisco, and Wilhelm Lowey, Clerk'' 27 Cal. 655) directing that the Bonds be countersigned and delivered. In 1863 the legislature's forcing of City and County action became known as the \"Dutch Flat Swindle\". Critics claimed the CPRR intended to build a railroad only as far as Dutch Flat, to connect to the Dutch Flat Wagon Road which they already controlled.\n\n==Museums and archives==\n[[Image:Lmc tdj.jpg|thumb|right|CPRR Original Chief Assistant Engineer L.M.

Additional collections of manuscript letters are held at Stanford University and the [[Mariners' Museum]] at [[Newport News, Virginia]]. [[Alfred A. Hart]] was the official [[photographer]] of the CPRR construction.\n\n==Locomotives==\n[[File:CPRR Locomotive -113 FALCON 1869.jpg|thumb|CPRR#113 ''FALCON'', a Danforth 4-4-0, at Argenta, Nevada, March 1, 1869 (Photo: J.B. Silvis)]]\n\nThe Central Pacific's first three locomotives were of the then common [[4-4-0]] type, although with the [[American Civil War]] raging in the east, they had difficulty acquiring engines from eastern builders, who at times only had smaller [[4-2-4T|4-2-4]] or [[4-2-2]] types available. Until the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental rail link]] and the railroad's opening of its own shops, all locomotives had to be purchased by builders in the northeastern U.S. The engines had to be dismantled, loaded on a ship, which would embark on a four-month journey that went around [[Cape Horn|South America's Cape Horn]] until arriving in Sacramento where the locomotives would be unloaded, re-assembled, and placed in service.\n\nLocomotives at the time came from many manufacturers, such as [[Cooke Locomotive and Machine Works|Cooke]], [[Schenectady Locomotive Works|Schenectady]], Mason, Rogers, Danforth, Norris, Booth, and McKay & Aldus, among others. The railroad had been on rather unfriendly terms with the [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], one of the more well-known firms. It is not clear as to the cause of this dispute, though some attribute it to the builder insisting on cash payment (though this has yet to be verified). Consequently, the railroad refused to buy engines from Baldwin, and three former [[Western Pacific Railroad (1862\u20131870)|Western Pacific Railroad]] (which the CP had absorbed in 1870) engines were the only Baldwin engines owned by the Central Pacific. The Central Pacific's dispute with Baldwin remained unresolved until well after the road had been acquired by the [[Southern Pacific]].\n\nIn the 1870s, the road opened up its own locomotive construction facilities in Sacramento. [[Central Pacific 173|Central Pacific's 173]] was rebuilt by these shops and served as the basis for CP's engine construction. The locomotives built before the 1870s were given names as well as numbers. By the 1870s, it was decided to eliminate the names and as each engine was sent to the shops for service, their names would be removed. However, one engine that was built in the 1880s did receive a name: the [[El Gobernador]].\n\nConstruction of the rails was often dangerous work. Towards the end of construction, almost all workers were [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese immigrants]]. The ethnicity of workers depended largely on the \"gang\" of workers/specific area on the rails they were working.\n\n==Preserved locomotives==\n{{see also|List of preserved Southern Pacific Railroad rolling stock}}\n\nThe following CP engines have been preserved:\n* [[Gov. Stanford|Central Pacific 1, ''Gov. Stanford'']]\n* CP 233, a [[2-6-2T]] the railroad had built, is stored at the [[California State Railroad Museum]].\n* [[C. P. Huntington|Central Pacific 3, ''C. P.

Moreover, its specifications were derived from CP 173, and thus is the only surviving example of that engine's design.\n* Central Pacific's numbers [[Jupiter (locomotive)|60, ''Jupiter'']], and 63 ''Leviathan''. Although both engines have been scrapped, and therefore technically do not count as having been preserved, there were exact, full size operating replicas built in recent years. The ''Jupiter'' was built for the [[National Park Service]] along with a replica of Union Pacific's 119 for use at their [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]]. ''Leviathan'' was finished in 2009, is privately owned, and travels to various railroads to operate.\n\n==Timeline==\n'''1861'''\n* June 28, 1861: \"Central Pacific Rail Road of California\" incorporated; name changed to \"Central Pacific Railroad of California\" on October 8, 1864, after the [[Pacific Railroad Acts|Pacific Railway Act]] amendment passes that summer.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/CPRR_By-Laws.html By-Laws of the Central Pacific Railroad Company of California, Incorporated: June 28, 1861] \"THE INDUSTRIAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, as developed by the official returns of the Northern and Southern States and Territories, with an APPENDIX containing a detailed description of Federal, State, and City securities, railroad and canal bonds and shares, bank shares, etc. from statements nearest Jan. 1, 1863, and the CHARTERS OF THE UNION PACIFIC RAILROADS, the GENERAL RAILROAD LAW OF CALIFORNIA, and the BY-LAWS OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC RAILROAD CO.

The author summarizes and criticizes previous treatments of this subject, and discusses his own findings. Using the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific systems as the basis for his investigation, the author concludes that the railroad owners received unaided rates of return that substantially exceeded the private rate of return on the average alternative project in the economy during the same period. Thus, the projects were profitable, although contemporary observers expected that the roads would be privately unprofitable without the land grant aid. The land grants did not have a major effect, increasing the private rate of return only slightly. Nevertheless, he says the policy of subsidizing those railroad systems was beneficial for society since the social rate of return from the project was substantial and exceeded the private rate by a significant margin.\n* {{cite journal| title=The Central Pacific Railroad and Exploitation of Chinese Labor| first = Paul M.| last = Ong| journal = Journal of Ethnic Studies| volume = 13| issue = 2| year = 1985| pages = 119\u2013124}} Ong tries to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the literature on Asians in early California, with contradictory studies showing evidence both for and against the exploitation of Chinese labor by the CPRR, using [[monopsony]] theory as developed by Joan Robinson. Because CPRR set different wages for whites and Chinese (each group had different elasticities of supply) and used the two classes in different types of positions, the two groups were complementary, rather than interchangeable. Calculations thus show higher levels of exploitation of the Chinese than found in previous studies.\n* {{cite journal| title=The Army of Canton in the High Sierra| first = Alexander|last = Saxton| journal = Pacific Historical Review| volume = 35| issue = 2| year = 1966| pages = 141\u2013151| doi=10.2307/3636678}}\n* {{cite journal| title=Stanford's Responses to Competition: Rhetoric Versus Reality| first = Norman E.|last = Tutorow| journal = Southern California Quarterly| volume = 52| issue = 3| year = 1970| pages = 231\u2013247| doi=10.2307/41170298}} Leland Stanford and the men who ran the CPRR paid lip-service to the idea of free competition, but in practice sought to dominate competing railroad and shipping lines. Analyzing the period 1869-1893, the author shows how Stanford and his associates repeatedly entered into pooling arrangements to prevent competition, bought out competitors, or forced rivals to agree not to compete. He concludes that Stanford and his partners viewed ''laissez-faire'' as applicable only to government controls, and not to businessmen's destruction of competition within the system.\n* {{cite journal| title=Information, Markets, and Corruption: Transcontinental Railroads in the Gilded Age| first = Richard| last = White| journal = The Journal of American History| volume = 90| issue = 1| year = 2003}}\n* {{cite book| title = A Great and Shining Road: The Epic Story of the Transcontinental Railroad| first = John Hoyt| last = Williams| location = New York| publisher = Times Books| year = 1988| isbn=0-8129-1668-9 }}\n* {{Cite episode| title = The Iron Road| series = The American Experience| credits = Neil Goodwin, Peace River Films| network = PBS| airdate = 1990}}\n* {{cite book| title = Iron Horses to Promontory| first = Gerald M| last = Best| location = New York| publisher = Golden West| year = 1969| isbn= }}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* [http://CPRR.org Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum]\n* [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt6c602823 Railroads in California], handwritten report by L.

It can be divided into roughly three classes: [[precognition]], the ability to perceive or predict future events, [[retrocognition]], the ability to see past events, and [[remote viewing]], the perception of contemporary events happening outside of the range of normal perception.<ref>[[J.

Gale Group, Detroit. {{ISBN|978-0810385702}}.</ref>\n\n==In history==\nThroughout history, there have been numerous places and times in which people have claimed themselves or others to be clairvoyant.\n\nA number of Christian saints were said to be able to see or know things that were far removed from their immediate sensory perception as a kind of gift from God, including [[Columba of Iona]], [[Padre Pio]] and [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]]. [[Jesus Christ]] in the Gospels is also recorded as being able to know things that were far removed from his immediate human perception.\n\nIn other religions, similar stories of certain individuals being able to see things far removed from their immediate sensory perception are commonplace, especially within pagan religions where [[oracle]]s were used. [[Prophecy]] often involved some degree of clairvoyance, especially when future events were predicted.\n\nIn most of these cases, however, the ability to see things was attributed to a higher power and not thought of as an ability that lay within the person himself.\n\n== Jainism ==\n{{Main|Jain epistemology}}\nIn [[Jainism]], clairvoyance is regarded as one of the five kinds of knowledge. The beings of hell and heaven ([[Deva (Jainism)|devas]]) are said to possess clairvoyance by birth. According to Jain text [[Sarv\u0101rthasiddhi]], \"this kind of knowledge has been called ''avadhi'' as it ascertains matter in downward range or knows objects within limits\".{{sfn|S. A.

In 1972, [[Harold E. Puthoff|Harold Puthoff]] and [[Russell Targ]] initiated a series of human subject studies to determine whether participants (the ''viewers'' or ''percipients'') could reliably identify and accurately describe salient features of remote locations or ''targets''. In the early studies, a human ''sender'' was typically present at the remote location, as part of the experiment protocol. A three-step process was used, the first step being to randomly select the target conditions to be experienced by the senders. Secondly, in the viewing step, participants were asked to verbally express or sketch their impressions of the remote scene. Thirdly, in the judging step, these descriptions were matched by separate judges, as closely as possible, with the intended targets. The term [[remote viewing]] was coined to describe this overall process. The first paper by Puthoff and Targ on remote viewing was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in March 1974; in it, the team reported some degree of remote viewing success.<ref name=nat251>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/251602a0 |title=Information transmission under conditions of sensory shielding |year=1974 |first=Russel |last=Targ |first2=Harold |last2=Puthoff |journal=Nature |volume=251 |pages=602\u2013607 |pmid=4423858 |issue=5476}}</ref> After the publication of these findings, other attempts to replicate the experiments were carried out <ref name=hast1>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10369 |title=A confirmatory remote viewing experiment in a group setting |date=October 1976 |author=Hastings, A.C. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1544\u20131545 |last2=Hurt |first2=D.B.|issue=10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10371 |title=Preliminary experiments in group 'Remote viewing' |date=October 1976 |author=Whitson, T.W. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1550\u20131551 |last2=Bogart |first2=D.N. |last3=Palmer |first3=J. |last4=Tart |first4=C.T.|issue=10}}</ref> with remotely linked groups using computer conferencing.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.1109/PROC.1976.10372 |title=Remote viewing experiments through computer conferencing |date=October 1976 |author=Vallee, J. |journal=Proceedings of the IEEE |volume=64 |pages=1551\u20131552 |last2=Hastings |first2=A.C. |last3=Askevold |first3=G.|issue=10}}</ref>\n\nThe psychologists [[David Marks (psychologist)|David Marks]] and Richard Kammann attempted to replicate Targ and Puthoff's remote viewing experiments that were carried out in the 1970s at the Stanford Research Institute.

Marks and Kammann discovered that the notes given to the judges in Targ and Puthoff's experiments contained clues as to which order they were carried out, such as referring to yesterday's two targets, or they had the date of the session written at the top of the page.

Marks and Kammann argued that the 'cues' \u2013 clues to the order in which sites had been visited\u2014provided sufficient information for the results, without any recourse to extrasensory perception. Indeed Marks himself was able to achieve 100 percent accuracy in allocating some transcripts to sites without visiting any of the sites himself, purely on the ground basis of the cues. From Occam's razor, it follows that if a straightforward natural explanation exists, there is no need for the spectacular paranormal explanation: Targ and Puthoff's claims are not justified\".</ref> [[James Randi]] has written controlled tests by several other researchers, eliminating several sources of cuing and extraneous evidence present in the original tests, produced negative results.

One controlled procedure has invited 'senders' to telepathically transmit one of four visual images to 'receivers' deprived of sensation in a nearby chamber (Bem & Honorton, 1994). The result? A reported 32 percent accurate response rate, surpassing the chance rate of 25 percent. But follow-up studies have (depending on who was summarizing the results) failed to replicate the phenomenon or produced mixed results (Bem & others, 2001; Milton & Wiseman, 2002; Storm, 2000, 2003).<br /><br />One skeptic, magician [[James Randi]], has a longstanding offer\u2014now [[One Million Dollar Paranormal Challenge|U.S. $1 million]]\u2014\"to anyone who proves a genuine psychic power under proper observing conditions\" (Randi, 1999). French, Australian, and Indian groups have parallel offers of up to 200,000 euros to anyone with demonstrable paranormal abilities (CFI, 2003). Large as these sums are, the scientific seal of approval would be worth far more to anyone whose claims could be authenticated. To refute those who say there is no ESP, one need only produce a single person who can demonstrate a single, reproducible ESP phenomenon. So far, no such person has emerged. Randi's offer has been publicized for three decades and dozens of people have been tested, sometimes under the scrutiny of an independent panel of judges. Still, nothing.  \"People's desire to believe in the paranormal is stronger than all the evidence that it does not exist.\" [[Susan Blackmore]], \"Blackmore's first law\", 2004.<ref>[[David Myers (academic)|Myers, David]].

Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory, their function being to restrain secretion.

These concepts are still considered vital in understanding the increasing complexity of modern [[battle]]fields.\n\nKrulak explained some of his warfighting philosophy in an interview with [[Tom Clancy]] in Clancy's nonfiction book ''[[Marine (book)|Marine]]''. Clancy referred to Krulak as \"Warrior Prince of the Corps.\" Krulak also rewrote the Marine Corps' basic combat study text, ''[[MCDP 1: Warfighting]]'', incorporating his theories on operations in the modern battlefield.\n\n==Family==\nKrulak is married to Zandi Meyers from Annapolis. They have two sons: David C. Krulak, a surgeon with the United States Marine Corps Forces, Pacific,<ref>https://www.dvidshub.net/image/1535107/krulak-gets-promoted-captain</ref> and Todd; and five grandchildren: Brian, Katie, Mary, Matthew and Charles.\nHe is the son of Lieutenant General [[Victor H. Krulak]], Sr., and the younger brother of Commander Victor H. Krulak Jr, [[United States Navy Chaplain Corps|Navy Chaplain Corps]] and Colonel William Krulak, United States Marine Corps Reserve.<ref>Coram, Robert (2010).

By giving dealers considerable leeway in pricing Compaq's offerings, either a significant markup for more profits or discount for more sales, dealers had a major incentive to advertise Compaq.<ref name=\"entrepreneur1\"/><ref name=\"britannica1\"/>\n\nDuring its first year of sales (second year of operation), the company sold 53,000 PCs for sales of $111 million, the first start-up to hit the $100 million mark that fast. Compaq went public in 1983 on the NYSE and raised $67 million. In 1986, it enjoyed record sales of $329 million from 150,000 PCs, and became the youngest-ever firm to make the [[Fortune 500]].

Other key executives responsible for the company's meteoric growth in the late 80s and early 90s were Ross A. Cooley, another former IBM associate, who served for many years as SVP of GM North America; Michael Swavely, who was the company's chief marketing officer in the early years, and eventually ran the North America organization, later passing along that responsibility to Cooley when Swavely retired. In the United States, Brendan A. \"Mac\" McLoughlin (another long time IBM executive) led the company's field sales organization after starting up the Western U.S. Area of Operations. These executives, along with other key contributors, including Kevin Ellington, Douglas Johns, Steven Flannigan, and Gary Stimac, helped the company compete against the IBM Corporation in all personal computer sales categories, after many predicted that none could compete with the behemoth.\n\nThe soft-spoken Canion was popular with employees and the culture that he built helped Compaq to attract the best talent. Instead of headquartering the company in a downtown Houston skyscraper, Canion chose a West Coast-style campus surrounded by forests, where every employee had similar offices and no-one (not even the CEO) had a reserved parking spot. At semi-annual meetings, turnout was high as any employee could ask questions to senior managers.<ref name=\"scribd1\"/><ref name=\"entrepreneur1\"/>\n\nIn 1987, company co-founder Bill Murto resigned to study at a religious education program at the University of St. Thomas. Murto had helped to organize the company's marketing and authorized-dealer distribution strategy, and held the post of senior vice president of sales since June 1985. Murto was succeeded by Ross A.

The Compaq Portable was one of the progenitors of today's [[laptop]]; some called it a \"suitcase computer\" for its size and the look of its case. It was the second IBM PC compatible, being capable of running all software that would run on an [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]]. It was a commercial success, selling 53,000 units in its first year and generating $111 million in sales revenue. The Compaq Portable was the first in the range of the [[Compaq Portable series]]. Compaq was able to market a legal IBM clone because [[IBM]] mostly used \"off the shelf\" parts for their [[IBM Personal Computer|PC]]. Furthermore, [[Microsoft]] had kept the right to license [[MS-DOS|the operating system]] to other computer manufacturers.

An IBM-made 386 machine eventually reached the market seven months later, but by that time Compaq was the 386 supplier of choice and IBM had lost its image of technical leadership.\n\nFor the first three months after announcement, the Deskpro 386 shipped with Windows/386. This was a version of Windows 2.1 adapted for the 80386 processor. Support for the [[virtual 8086 mode]] was added by Compaq engineers.\n\n====Compaq SystemPro====\nCompaq's technical leadership and the rivalry with IBM was emphasized when the [[Compaq SystemPro|SystemPro]] server was launched in late 1989 \u2013 this was a true server product with standard support for a second CPU and [[RAID]], but also the first product to feature the [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] bus, designed in reaction to IBM's MCA ([[MicroChannel Architecture]]) which was incompatible with the original AT bus.\n\nAlthough Compaq had become successful by being 100 percent IBM-compatible, it decided to continue with the original AT bus\u2014which it renamed [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]]{{r|iw19890123}}\u2014instead of licensing IBM's MCA. Prior to developing EISA Compaq had invested significant resources into reverse engineering MCA, but its executives correctly calculated that the $80 billion already spent by corporations on IBM-compatible technology would make it difficult for even IBM to force manufacturers to adopt the new MCA design. Instead of cloning MCA, Compaq formed an alliance with Hewlett Packard and seven other major manufacturers, known collectively as the \"Gang of Nine\", to develop EISA.<ref name=\"britannica1\"/>{{r|iw19890123}}\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:HewlettPackardCampusHarrisCoTX.png|thumb|Aerial map of the Compaq headquarters, now the [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] USA campus in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Harris County, Texas]]]]\n\nBy 1989 Compaq was so influential that observers and its executives spoke of \"Compaq compatible\".

Under pressure from Compaq's board to control costs as staff was ballooning at their Houston headquarters despite falling U.S. sales, while the number of non-U.S. employees had stayed constant, Compaq made its first-ever layoffs (1400 employees which was 12% of its workforce) while Pfeiffer was promoted to EVP and COO.<ref name=\"scribd1\"/>\n\nRosen and Canion had disagreed about how to counter the cheaper Asian PC imports, as Canion wanted Compaq to build lower cost PCs with components developed in-house in order to preserve Compaq's reputation for engineering and quality, while Rosen believed that Compaq needed to buy standard components from suppliers and reach the market faster. While Canion developed an 18-month plan to create a line of low-priced computers, Rosen sent his own Compaq engineering team to Comdex without Canion's knowledge and discovered that a low-priced PC could be made in half the time and at lower cost than Canion's initiative.<ref name=\"scribd1\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197620 |title = Joseph R. \"Rod\" Canion |publisher = Entrepreneur.com |date = 2008-10-10 |accessdate = 2012-08-26 }}</ref> It was also believed{{by whom|date=March 2014}} that Canion's consensus-style management slowed the company's ability to react in the market, whereas Pfeiffer's autocratic style would be suited to price and product competition.<ref name=vcfed>{{cite web |title = Compaq Computer Corporation [Archive]  - Vintage Computer Forum |url = http://www.vcfed.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-32148.html |website = www.vcfed.org |accessdate = 26 July 2016 }}</ref>\n\nRosen initiated a 14-hour board meeting, and the directors also interviewed Pfeiffer for several hours without informing Canion.

Two weeks after Canion's ouster, five other senior executives resigned, including remaining company founder [[Jim Harris (entrepreneur)|James Harris]] as SVP of Engineering.

Rose had joined Compaq in 1993 from Digital Equipment Corporation where he oversaw the personal computer division and worldwide engineering, while Stimac had been with Compaq since 1982 and was one of the longest-serving executives. Senior Vice-President for North America Ross Cooley announced his resignation effective at the end of 1996. CFO Daryl J. White, who joined the company in January, 1983 resigned in May, 1996 after 8 years as CFO.

Under Mason's guidance, Compaq utilized its assets more efficiently instead of focusing just on income and profits, which increased Compaq's cash from $700 million to nearly $5 billion in one year. Also Compaq's return on invested capital (after-tax operating profit divided by operating assets) has doubled to 50 percent from 25 percent in that period.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nCompaq had been producing the PC chassis at its plant in [[Shenzhen, China]] to cut costs. In 1996, instead of expanding its own plant, Compaq asked a Taiwanese supplier to set up a new factory nearby to produce the mechanicals, with the Taiwanese supplier owning the inventory until it reached Compaq in Houston.<ref name=\"businessweek1996\"/> Pfeiffer also introduced a new distribution strategy, to build PCs made-to-order which would eliminate the stockpile of computers in warehouses and cut the components inventory down to two weeks, with the supply chain from supplier to dealer linked by complex software.<ref name=\"nytimes1996\"/>\n\nVice-President for Corporate Development Kenneth E. Kurtzman assembled five teams to examine Compaq's businesses and assess each unit's strategy and that of key rivals. Kurtzman's teams recommended to Pfeiffer that each business unit had to be first or second in its market within three years\u2014or else Compaq should exit that line. Also, the company should no longer use profits from high-margin businesses to carry marginally profitable ones, as instead each unit must show a return on investment.<ref name=\"businessweek1996\"/> Pfeiffer's vision was to make Compaq a full-fledged computer company, moving beyond its main business of manufacturing retail PCs and into the more lucrative business services and solutions that IBM did well at, such as computer servers which would also require more \"customer handholding\" from either the dealers or Compaq staff themselves.<ref name=\"nytimes1996\"/>\nUnlike IBM and HP, Compaq was not going to build up field technicians and programmers in-house as these could be costly assets, instead Compaq would leverage its partnerships (including these with Andersen Consulting and software maker SAP) to install and maintain corporate systems. This allowed Compaq to compete in the \"big-iron market\" without incurring the costs of running its own services or software businesses.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1996-07-21/compaq-at-the-crossroads |title = Compaq At The `Crossroads' |first = Gary |last = Mcwilliams |publisher =  |accessdate = 29 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 1998, Compaq was at its height. CEO Pfeiffer boldly predicted that the [[Microsoft]]/[[Intel]] \"Wintel\" duopoly would be replaced by \"Wintelpaq\".\n\n====Acquisitions====\nPfeiffer also made several major (and some minor) acquisitions. In 1997, Compaq bought [[Tandem Computers]], known for their [[NonStop]] server line.<ref name=cnet19970623>{{cite web |url = http://www.cnet.com/news/compaq-buys-tandem/ |title = Compaq buys Tandem |publisher = cnet.com |date = 1997-06-23 |accessdate = 2016-04-26 }}</ref> This acquisition instantly gave Compaq a presence in the higher end business computing market.

The merger made Compaq, at the time, the world's second largest computer maker in the world in terms of revenue behind IBM.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Digital Equipment, which had nearly twice as many employees as Compaq while generating half the revenue, had been a leading computer company during the 1970s and early 1980s. However, Digital had struggled during the 1990s, with high operating costs. For nine years the company had lost money or barely broke even, and had recently refocused itself as a \"network solutions company\". In 1995, Compaq had considered a bid for Digital but only became seriously interested in 1997 after Digital's major divestments and refocusing on the Internet. At the time of the acquisition, services accounted for 45 percent of Digital's revenues (about $6 billion) and their gross margins on services averaged 34 percent, considerably higher than Compaq's 25% margins on PC sales and also satisfying customers who had demanded more services from Compaq for years. Compaq had originally wanted to purchase only Digital's services business but that was turned down.<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite web |url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/05/24/260278/ |title = Archived copy |accessdate = 2013-11-15 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203034053/http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1999/05/24/260278/ |archivedate = 2013-12-03 |df = }}</ref> When the announcement was made, it was initially viewed as a master stroke as it immediately gave Compaq a 22,000 person global service operation to help corporations handle major technological purchases (by 2001 services made up over 20% of Compaq's revenues, largely due to the Digital employees inherited from the merger), in order to compete with IBM. However it was also risky merger, as the combined company would have to lay off 2,000 employees from Compaq and 15,000 from Digital which would potentially hurt morale. Furthermore, Compaq fell behind schedule in integrating Digital's operations, which also distracted the company from its strength in low-end PCs where it used to lead the market in rolling out next-generation systems which let rival [[Dell Computer Corporation|Dell]] grab market share.<ref name=\"scribd1\"/><ref>[https://archive.is/20130104110939/http://www.mhhe.com/business/management/updates/thompson12e/case/dell10.html]</ref> Reportedly Compaq had three consulting firms working to integrate Digital alone.<ref name=\"businessweek1999\">{{cite web |url = http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_18/b3627136.htm |title = CHART: Compaq's Stock Price |publisher = Businessweek.com |date = 1999-05-03 |accessdate = 2012-11-16 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121027010439/http://www.businessweek.com/1999/99_18/b3627136.htm |archivedate = 2012-10-27 |df = }}</ref>\n\nHowever, Pfeiffer had little vision for what the combined companies should do, or indeed how the three dramatically different cultures could work as a single entity, and Compaq struggled from strategy indecisiveness and lost focus, as a result being caught in between the low end and high end of the market.<ref>{{cite web |author = 24/7 Wall St. |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/the-worst-ceos-in-american-history-2010-5?op=1 |title = The 15 Worst CEOs In American History |publisher = Business Insider |date = 2010-05-04 |accessdate = 2012-11-16 }}</ref> Mark Anderson, president of Strategic News Service, a research firm based in Friday Harbor, Wash. was quoted as saying ''The kind of goals he had sounded good to shareholders \u2013 like being a $50 billion company by the year 2000, or to beat I.B.M. \u2013 but they didn't have anything to do with customers. The new C.E.O. should look at everything Eckhard acquired and ask: did the customer benefit from that. If the answer isn't yes, they should get rid of it.'' On one hand, Compaq had previously dominated the PC market with its price war but was now struggling against [[Dell Computer Corporation|Dell]], which sold directly to buyers, avoiding the dealer channel and its markup, and built each machine to order to keep inventories and costs at a minimum.<ref name=\"businessweek1999\"/> At the same time, Compaq, through its acquisitions of the Digital Equipment Corporation last year and Tandem Computer in 1997, had tried to become a major systems company, like IBM and Hewlett-Packard.

By summer 1998, Compaq was suffering from product-quality problems. Robert W. Stearns, SVP of Business Development, said \"In [Pfeiffer's] quest for bigness, he lost an understanding of the customer and built what I call empty market share--large but not profitable\", while Jim Moore, a technology strategy consultant with GeoPartners Research in Cambridge, Mass., says Pfeiffer \"raced to scale without having economies of scale.\" The \"colossus\" that Pfeiffer built up was not nimble enough to adapt to the fast-changing computer industry. That year Compaq forecast demand poorly and overshipped too many PCs, causing resellers to dump them at fire sale prices, and since Compaq protected resellers from heavy losses it cost them two quarters of operating profits.<ref name=\"cnn.com\"/>\n\nPfeiffer also refused to develop a potential successor, rebuffing Rosen's suggestion to recruit a few executives to create the separate position of Compaq president. The board complained that Pfeiffer was too removed from management and the rank-and-file, as he surrounded himself with a \"clique\" of Chief Financial Officer Earl Mason, Senior Vice-President John T. Rose, and Senior Vice-President of Human Resources Hans Gutsch. Current and former Compaq employees complained that Gutsch was part of a group of senior executives, dubbed the \"A team\", who controlled access to Pfeiffer. Gutsch was said to be a \"master of corporate politics, pitting senior vice presidents against each other and inserting himself into parts of the company that normally would not be under his purview\". Gutsch, who oversaw security, had an extensive security system and guard station installed on the eight floor of CCA-1, where the company's senior vice presidents worked.<ref name=\"dwightsilverman.com\">{{cite web |url = http://www.dwightsilverman.com/cpq-mgmt.htm |title = Schism in management blamed for Compaq woes |publisher =  |accessdate = 29 June 2016 }}</ref> There were accusations that Gutsch and others sought to divide top management, although this was regarded by others as sour grapes on the part of executives who were shut out of planning that involved the acquisitions of Tandem and Digital Equipment Corp.<ref name=\"businessweek.com\"/><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dwightsilverman.com/gutsch.htm |title = Compaq's Gutsch quits post |publisher = Dwightsilverman.com |date = 1999-06-16 |accessdate = 2012-11-16 }}</ref> Pfeiffer reduced the size of the group working on the deal due to news leaks, saying \"We cut the team down to the minimum number of people - those who would have to be directly involved, and not one person more\". Robert W.

Fourth-quarter 1998 earnings reported in January 1999 beat expectations by six cents a share with record 48 percent growth.

In the 1990s, as IBM's own PC division declined, Compaq faced other IBM PC Compatible manufacturers like [[Dell Computer]], [[Packard Bell]], [[AST Research]], and [[Gateway 2000]].\n\nBy the mid-1990s, Compaq's price war had enabled it to overtake IBM and Apple, while other IBM PC Compatible manufacturers such as Packard Bell and AST were driven from the market.\n\nDell became the number one supplier of PCs in 2001.\n\nAt the time of their 2002 merger, Compaq and HP were the [[Market share of personal computer vendors|second and third]] largest PC manufacturers, so their combination made them number one. However, the combined HP-Compaq struggled and fell to second place behind Dell from 2003\u20132006. Due to Dell's struggles in late 2006, HP has led all PC vendors since 2007 onwards.\n\nDuring its existence as a division of HP, Compaq primarily competed against other budget-oriented personal computer series from manufacturers including [[Acer Inc.|Acer]], [[Lenovo]], and [[Toshiba]]. Most of Compaq's competitors except Dell were later acquired by bigger rivals like Acer (Gateway 2000 and Packard Bell) and Lenovo absorbing IBM's PC division.\n\n==Sponsorship==\nBefore its merger with HP, Compaq sponsored the [[WilliamsF1|Williams Formula One team]] when it was still powered by BMW engines. HP inherited and continued the sponsorship deal for a few years.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Houston|Companies|Computer Science}}\n* [[Compaq Portable series]]\n* [[List of computer system manufacturers]]\n* [[Market share of personal computer vendors]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060607192724/http://www.washingtontechnology.com/news/16_13/business/17177-1.html HP-Compaq merger (washingtontechnology.com)]\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4938484/ Silicon Cowboys (2016) Documentary]\n* [http://www.thecompaqstory.com/ web site of OPEN] - How Compaq Ended IBM's PC Domination and Helped Invent Modern Computing book\n\n{{HP}}\n{{Queens Park Rangers F.C. shirt sponsors}}\n\n[[Category:Compaq Computer Corporation| ]]\n[[Category:1982 establishments in Texas]]\n[[Category:2001 disestablishments in Texas]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1982]]\n[[Category:Computer companies disestablished in 2002]]\n[[Category:Computer companies established in 1982]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Texas]]\n[[Category:Defunct computer companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Defunct computer hardware companies]]\n[[Category:Display technology companies]]\n[[Category:Hewlett-Packard acquisitions]]\n[[Category:Manufacturing companies based in Houston]]\n[[Category:2002 mergers and acquisitions]]", "sha1": "axrdvnk85bsq4vodivb2l9fr1fv4cjy"}}, {"title": "Cell Incubator", "ns": "0", "id": "7743", "redirect": {"title": "Incubator (culture)"}, "revision": {"id": "439880617", "parentid": "360520341", "timestamp": "2011-07-17T02:30:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kjkolb", "id": "107439"}, "comment": "#REDIRECT [[Incubator (culture)]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Incubator (culture)]]", "sha1": "cn0wvr6pqox503ptl3jpc5xfphhrqku"}}, {"title": "Cell incubator", "ns": "0", "id": "7744", "redirect": {"title": "Incubator (culture)"}, "revision": {"id": "783861591", "parentid": "439880652", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:39:43Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Incubator (culture)]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from merge}}\n}}", "sha1": "h90oqm1pifz4vceh3jtcp37cubvp6ee"}}, {"title": "CPSU (disambiguation)", "ns": "0", "id": "7751", "revision": {"id": "667719373", "parentid": "644113331", "timestamp": "2015-06-20T04:06:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Iamtheyeishow", "id": "16338262"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''CPSU'''  can refer to:\n* [[Central Philippines State University]], a state university in the Philippines\n* [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union (1992)]]\n* [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Shenin)]]\n* [[Union of Communist Parties \u2014 Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Communist Party of Social Justice]] \u2014 political party in Russia established in 2012\n* [[Civil and Public Services Union]] - an Irish trade union\n* [[Community and Public Sector Union]] - an Australian trade union\n* [[California Polytechnic State University]] in San Luis Obispo, California, USA\n* [[Commonwealth Policy Studies Unit]]\n* [[Coventry Polytechnic]] Students Union\n\n{{disambiguation}}", "sha1": "7d7t5a7jfc9twll7ikigb3ele5czfhd"}}, {"title": "Cluny", "ns": "0", "id": "7755", "revision": {"id": "839452271", "parentid": "797529057", "timestamp": "2018-05-03T14:39:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Fayenatic london", "id": "1639942"}, "comment": "added [[Category:Cluny]] using [[WP:HC|HotCat]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Infobox French commune\n|name                   = Cluny\n|commune status         = [[Communes of France|Commune]]\n|image coat of arms     = Blason ville Cluny.svg\n|image                  = Cluny heute2.jpg\n|region                 = [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9]]\n|department             = [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]]\n|arrondissement         = M\u00e2con\n|canton                 = Cluny\n|INSEE                  = 71137\n|postal code            = 71250\n|mayor                  = Jean-Luc Delpeuch\n|term                   = 2008&ndash;2015\n|coordinates            = {{coord|46.4353|4.66|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|elevation m            = 248\n|elevation min m        = 226\n|elevation max m        = 574\n|area km2               = 23.71\n|population             = 4835\n|population date        = 2006\n}}\n'''Cluny''' is a [[Communes of France|commune]] in the eastern French [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Sa\u00f4ne-et-Loire]], in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comt\u00e9]].

After three years, he moved to [[WLW|WLW-AM]] in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], where Merle Travis had formerly worked.\n\nAfter six months, he moved to Raleigh and worked with [[Johnnie and Jack]] before heading for [[Richmond, Virginia]], where he performed with Sunshine Sue Workman.

He was fired often, but was soon able to land another job at another radio station on account of his unique playing ability.<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\nAtkins and [[Jethro Burns]] (of [[Homer and Jethro]]) married twin sisters, Leona and Lois Johnson, who sang as Laverne and Fern Johnson, the Johnson Sisters.

Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> Atkins made his first appearance at the Opry in 1946 as a member of Foley's band. He also recorded a single for Nashville-based [[Bullet Records]] that year. That single, \"Guitar Blues\", was fairly progressive, including a clarinet solo by the Nashville dance band musician Dutch McMillan, with [[Owen Bradley]] on piano. He had a solo spot on the Opry, but when that was cut, Atkins moved on to [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Despite the support of executive [[Si Siman]], however, he soon was fired for not sounding \"country enough\".<ref name=\"CG\" />\n\n===Signing with RCA Victor===\nWhile working with a Western band in [[Denver, Colorado]], Atkins came to the attention of [[RCA Victor Records|RCA Victor]]. Siman had been encouraging [[Stephen H. Sholes|Steve Sholes]] to sign Atkins, as his style (with the success of Merle Travis as a hit recording artist) was suddenly in vogue. Sholes, A&R director of country music at RCA, tracked Atkins down in Denver.\n\nHe made his first RCA Victor recordings in Chicago in 1947, but they did not sell. He did some studio work for RCA that year, but had relocated to Knoxville again where he worked with Homer and Jethro on WNOX's new Saturday night radio show ''The Tennessee Barn Dance'' and the popular ''Midday Merry Go Round''.\n\nIn 1949, he left WNOX to join [[June Carter]] with Mother Maybelle and the [[The Carter Sisters|Carter Sisters]] on KWTO. This incarnation of the old [[Carter Family]] featured Maybelle Carter and daughters June, Helen, and Anita. Their work soon attracted attention from the Grand Ole Opry. The group relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in the mid-1950s. Atkins began working on recording sessions and performing on [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]] and the Opry.<ref name=\"CG\" /> Atkins became a member of the Opry in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Opry Timeline \u2013 1950s\n| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html\n| date = \n| accessdate = July 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWhile he had not yet had a hit record for RCA Victor, his stature was growing. He began assisting Sholes as a session leader when the New York\u2013based producer needed help organizing Nashville sessions for RCA Victor artists. Atkins's first hit single was \"[[Mr. Sandman]]\", followed by \"Silver Bell\", which he recorded as a duet with [[Hank Snow]]. His albums also became more popular. He was featured on ABC-TV's ''[[The Eddy Arnold Show]]'' in the summer of 1956 and on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Country Music Jubilee]]'' in 1957 and 1958 (by then renamed ''Jubilee USA'').\n[[File:Gretsch G6122-1958.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins's [[Gretsch]] Country Gentleman, model G6122, 1962]]\n\nIn addition to recording, Atkins was a design consultant for [[Gretsch]], which manufactured a popular Chet Atkins line of electric guitars from 1955\u20131980. He became manager of RCA Victor's Nashville studios, eventually inspiring and seeing the completion of the legendary [[RCA Studio B]], the first studio built specifically for the purpose of recording on the now-famous [[Music Row]]. Also later on, Chet and [[Owen Bradley]] would become instrumental in the creation of studio B\u2019s adjacent building [[RCA Studio A]] as well.<ref name=\"mamg\" />\n\n===Performer and producer===\nWhen Sholes took over pop production in 1957\u2014a result of his success with [[Elvis Presley]]\u2014he put Atkins in charge of RCA Victor's Nashville division. With country music record sales declining as rock and roll became more popular, Atkins and [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] took their cue from [[Owen Bradley]] and eliminated fiddles and steel guitar as a means of making country singers appeal to pop fans. This became known as the [[Nashville sound]], which Atkins said was a label created by the media for a style of recording during that period intended to keep country (and their jobs) viable.\n\nAtkins used the [[Jordanaires]] and a rhythm section on hits such as [[Jim Reeves]]'s \"[[Four Walls (song)|Four Walls]]\" and \"[[He'll Have to Go]]\"<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r245817|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic entry for ''Welcome to My World'', Jim Reeves 1996 box set, Bear Family Records]</ref> and [[Don Gibson]]'s \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\" and \"Blue Blue Day\".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1624|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography of Don Gibson]</ref> The once-rare phenomenon of having a country hit [[Crossover (music)|cross over]] to pop success became more common. He and Bradley had essentially put the producer in the driver's seat, guiding an artist's choice of material and the musical background.\n\nAtkins made his own records, which usually visited pop standards and [[jazz]], in a sophisticated home studio, often recording the rhythm tracks at RCA and adding his solo parts at home, refining the tracks until the results satisfied him.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Guitarists of all styles came to admire various Atkins albums for their unique musical ideas and in some cases experimental electronic ideas. In this period, he became known internationally as \"Mister Guitar\", inspiring an album, ''[[Mister Guitar]]'', engineered by both Bob Ferris and [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]], Ferris's replacement.\n\n[[File:RCA Studio B - Chet Atkins, Bill Porter.jpg|thumb|upright|Atkins listening as [[Bill Porter (sound engineer)|Bill Porter]] adjusts a mix in RCA's Nashville studio]]\nAt the end of March 1959, Porter took over as chief engineer at RCA's Nashville studio, in the space eventually known as [[RCA Studio B|Studio B]] after the facility expanded with a second studio in 1960. (At the time, RCA's sole Nashville studio had no letter designation.) Porter soon helped Atkins get a better reverberation sound from the studio's German effects device, an [[Elektro-Mess-Technik|EMT]] [[Reverberation#Plate reverberators|plate reverb]]. With his [[golden ear]], Porter found the studio's acoustics to be problematic, and he devised a set of acoustic baffles to hang from the ceiling, then selected positions for microphones based on resonant [[room modes]]. The sound of the recordings improved significantly, and the studio achieved a string of successes. The Nashville sound became more [[Dynamic range|dynamic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Ballou|first=Glen|title=Handbook for Sound Engineers|year=1998|publisher=Focal Press|page=1154}}</ref> In later years, when Bradley asked how he achieved his sound, Atkins told him \"it was Porter.\"<ref name=McClellan2004>{{cite book |last1=McClellan |first1=John |last2=Bratic |first2=Deyan |title=Chet Atkins in Three Dimensions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mmCUExOXx0MC |volume=2 |year=2004 |publisher=Mel Bay Publications |isbn=0-7866-5877-0 |pages=149\u2013152}}</ref> Porter described Atkins as respectful of musicians when recording\u2014if someone was out of tune, he would not single that person out by name. Instead, he would say something like, \"we got a little tuning problem&nbsp;... Everybody check and see what's going on.\"<ref name=McClellan2004/> If that did not work, Atkins would instruct Porter to turn the offending player down in the mix. When Porter left RCA in late-1964, Atkins said, \"the sound was never the same, never as great.\"<ref name=McClellan2004/>\n\nAtkins's trademark \"Atkins style\" of playing uses the thumb and first two or sometimes three fingers of the right hand. He developed this style from listening to Merle Travis,<ref name=pc10>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19758/m1/ |title=Show 10 \u2013 Tennessee Firebird: American Country Music Before and After Elvis. [Part 2] }}</ref> occasionally on a primitive radio. He was sure no one could play that articulately with just the thumb and index finger (which was exactly how Travis played), and he assumed it required the thumb and two fingers\u2014and that was the style he pioneered and mastered.\n\nHe enjoyed jamming with fellow studio musicians, and they were asked to perform at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1960. That performance was cancelled because of rioting, but a live recording of the group (''[[After the Riot in Newport|After the Riot at Newport]]'') was released. Atkins performed by invitation at the [[White House]] for every U.S. President from John F. Kennedy through to George H. W. Bush. Atkins was a member of the [[Million Dollar Band (country music group)|Million Dollar Band]] during the 1980s. He is also well known for his song \"Yankee Doodle Dixie\", in which he played \"[[Yankee Doodle]]\" and \"[[Dixie (song)|Dixie]]\" simultaneously, on the same guitar.\n\nBefore his mentor Sholes died in 1968, Atkins had become vice president of RCA's country division. In 1987, he told [[Nine-O-One Network Magazine|''Nine-O-One Network'' magazine]] that he was \"ashamed\" of his promotion: \"I wanted to be known as a guitarist and I know, too, that they give you titles like that in lieu of money. So beware when they want to make you vice president.\"<ref>Nine-O-One Interview, Nine-O-One Network Magazine, December 1987, p.10-11</ref> He had brought [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Connie Smith]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[John Hartford]] to the label in the 1960s and inspired and helped countless others.<ref name=\"RockHall\">[http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/chet-atkins \"Chet Atkins\"], Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Accessed on March 28, 2008.</ref> He took a considerable risk during the mid-1960s, when the [[civil rights movement]] sparked violence throughout the South, by signing country music's first African-American singer, [[Charley Pride]], who sang rawer country than the smoother music Atkins had pioneered.\n\nAtkins's biggest hit single came in 1965, with \"Yakety Axe\", an adaptation of \"[[Yakety Sax]]\", by his friend, the saxophonist [[Boots Randolph]]. He rarely performed in those days and eventually hired other RCA producers, such as [[Bob Ferguson (music)|Bob Ferguson]] and [[Felton Jarvis]], to lessen his workload.<ref name=\"mamg\" />\n\n===Later career===\nIn the 1970s, Atkins became increasingly stressed by his executive duties. He produced fewer records, but could still turn out hits such as [[Perry Como]]'s 1973 pop hit \"[[And I Love You So (song)|And I Love You So]]\". He recorded extensively with close friend and fellow picker Jerry Reed, who had become a hit artist in his own right. A 1973 diagnosis of [[colorectal cancer|colon cancer]], however, led Atkins to redefine his role at RCA, to allow others to handle administration while he went back to his first love, the guitar, often recording with Reed or even Jethro Burns from Homer and Jethro (his brother-in-law) after Homer died in 1971.<ref name=\"mamg\" />\n\nBy the late-1970s, RCA decided to remove Atkins from his production duties and replace him with younger men. He also felt stifled because the record company would not let him branch into jazz. His mid-1970s collaborations with one of his influences, [[Les Paul]], ''[[Chester and Lester|Chester & Lester]]'' and ''[[Guitar Monsters]]'', had already reflected that interest; ''Chester & Lester'' was one of the best-selling recordings of Atkins's career. At the same time, he grew dissatisfied with the direction Gretsch (no longer family-owned) was going and withdrew his authorization for them to use his name and began designing guitars with [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]]. Atkins ended his 35-year association with RCA in 1982 and signed with [[Columbia Records]], for whom he produced a debut album in 1983.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" />\n\nJazz had always been a strong love of his, and often in his career he was criticized by \"pure\" country musicians for his jazz influences. He also said on many occasions that he did not like being called a \"country guitarist,\" insisting that he was \"a guitarist, period.\" Although he played [[Playing_by_ear|by ear]] and was a masterful improviser, he was able to read music and even performed some classical guitar pieces. When [[Roger C. Field]], a friend, suggested to him in 1991 that he record and perform with a female singer, he did so with [[Suzy Bogguss]].<ref name=\"mamg\"/>\n\nHe returned to his country roots for albums he recorded with [[Mark Knopfler]] and Jerry Reed.<ref name=\"mamg\" /> Knopfler had long mentioned Atkins as one of his earliest influences. Atkins also collaborated with Australian guitar legend [[Tommy Emmanuel]]. On being asked to name the ten most influential guitarists of the twentieth century, he named [[Django Reinhardt]] to the first position, and also placed himself on the list.<ref name=\"OfficialSite\">[http://www.misterguitar.com/news/chetsten.html Official Web Site of Chet Atkins]. Accessed on August 27, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn later years, he even went back to radio, appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'' radio program, on [[American Public Media]] radio, even picking up a fiddle from time to time,<ref name=\"mamg\" /> and performing songs such as [[Bob Wills]]'s \"[[Corrina, Corrina (song)|Corrina, Corrina]]\" and [[Willie Nelson]]'s \"[[Seven Spanish Angels]]\" with Nelson on a 1985 broadcast of the show at the Bridges Auditorium on the campus of [[Pomona College]] (then Claremont College).\n\n==Death and legacy==\nAtkins received numerous awards, including 14 Grammy awards and nine Country Music Association awards for Instrumentalist of the Year.<ref name=\"RollingStone\" /> In 1993, he was honored with the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. ''Billboard'' magazine awarded him its Century Award, its \"highest honor for distinguished creative achievement,\" in December 1997.<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/chetatkins/biography \"Biography&nbsp;\u2013 Chet Atkins\"]. ''Rolling Stone''. Accessed on May 10, 2008.</ref>\n\nAtkins is notable for his broad influence. His love for numerous styles of music can be traced from his early recording of the stride pianist [[James P. Johnson]]'s \"Johnson Rag\", all the way to the rock stylings of [[Eric Johnson]], an invited guest on Atkins's recording sessions, who, when Atkins attempted to copy his influential rocker \"[[Cliffs of Dover (song)|Cliffs of Dover]]\", led to Atkins's creation of a unique arrangement of \"Londonderry Air (Danny Boy)\".\n\nAtkins's recordings of \"Malague\u00f1a\" inspired a new generation of [[flamenco]] guitarists; the classical guitar selections included on almost all his albums were, for many American artists working in the field today, the first classical guitar they ever heard. He recorded [[smooth jazz]] guitar still played on American airwaves today.\n\nAtkins continued performing in the 1990s, but his health declined after he was diagnosed again with colon cancer in 1996. He died on June 30, 2001, at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 77.<ref>[http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html \"Obituary\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323145021/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/02/obit.chet.atkins/index.html |date=March 23, 2008 }}, CNN, July 2, 2001 Accessed June 21, 2008</ref> His memorial service was held at Ryman Auditorium in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/04/us/guitars-gently-weep-as-nashville-pays-tribute-to-chet-atkins.html|title=Guitars Gently Weep as Nashville Pays Tribute to Chet Atkins|date=July 4, 2001|work=The New York Times|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}</ref> He was buried at Harpeth Hills Memory Gardens in Nashville.<ref>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23366 Chet Atkins at Find a Grave.] Accessed November 24, 2010</ref>\n\nA stretch of [[Interstate 185 (Georgia)|Interstate 185]] in southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (between [[LaGrange, Georgia|LaGrange]] and [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]) is named \"Chet Atkins Parkway\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ganet.org/services/leg/ShowBillPre.cgi?year=1997&filename=1997/HR245.passed |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128185210/http://www.ganet.org/services/leg/ShowBillPre.cgi?year=1997&filename=1997%2FHR245.passed |archivedate=January 28, 2005 |title=Chet Atkins Parkway Bill Resolution. |accessdate=January 9, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This stretch of interstate runs through Fortson, where Atkins spent much of his childhood.\n\nIn 2002, Atkins was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"RockHall\" /> His award was presented by [[Marty Stuart]] and [[Brian Setzer]] and accepted by Atkins's grandson, Jonathan Russell.

by Truffaut attacked ''La qualit\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise'' (\"the French Quality\") (usually translated as \"The Tradition of Quality\") and was the manifesto for 'la politique des Auteurs' which [[Andrew Sarris]] later termed the [[auteur theory]] &mdash; resulting in the re-evaluation of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films and directors such as [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Howard Hawks]], [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Robert Aldrich]], [[Nicholas Ray]], and [[Fritz Lang]].<ref name=\"Guardian Macnab\"/> \n\n''Cahiers du Cinema'' authors also championed the work of directors [[Jean Renoir]], [[Roberto Rossellini]], [[Kenji Mizoguchi]], [[Max Oph\u00fcls]], and [[Jean Cocteau]], by centering their critical evaluations on a film's ''[[mise en sc\u00e8ne]]''. In turn, auteurs were compared and contrasted, and a true film dialogue was established. The magazine also was essential to the creation of the ''[[French New Wave|Nouvelle Vague]]'', or New Wave, of French cinema, which centered on films directed by ''Cahiers'' authors such as Godard and Truffaut. Movement by movement, style by style, the cahiers sought to advance and analyze the growth of world cinema.\n\nJacques Rivette replaced Rohmer as editor in 1963, shifted political and social concerns and paid more attention to the non-Hollywood cinema. The style moved through literary modernism in the early 1960s to radicalism and [[dialectical materialism]] by 1970. Moreover, during the mid-1970s the magazine was run by a [[Maoist]] editorial collective. In the mid-1970s, a review of the American film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' marked the magazine's return to more commercial perspectives, and an editorial turnover: ([[Serge Daney]], Serge Toubiana, Thierry Jousse, Antoine de Baecque, and Charles Tesson). It led to the rehabilitation of some of the old ''Cahiers'' favourites, as well as some new film makers like [[Manoel de Oliveira]], [[Raoul Ruiz]], [[Hou Hsiao-hsien]], [[Youssef Chahine]], and [[Maurice Pialat]]. Recent writers have included [[Serge Daney]], {{ill|Serge Toubiana|fr}}, {{ill|Thierry Jousse|fr}}, {{ill|Antoine de Baecque|fr}}, {{ill|Vincent Ostria|fr}}, {{ill|Charles Tesson|fr}} and [[Andr\u00e9 T\u00e9chin\u00e9]], [[L\u00e9os Carax]], [[Olivier Assayas]], Dani\u00e8le Dubroux, and Serge Le P\u00e9ron.\n\nIn 1998, the Editions de l'Etoile (the company publishing ''Cahiers'') was acquired by the press group ''[[Le Monde]]''.<ref>Dowell, Ben (10 February 2009) [https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/10/le-monde-sells-cahiers-du-cinema \"''Le Monde'' sells influential cinema magazine ''Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma''\"] ''The Guardian''</ref> Traditionally losing money, the magazine attempted a make-over in 1999 to gain new readers, leading to a first split among writers and resulting in a magazine addressing all visual arts in a [[post-modernism|post-modernist]] approach.

However, a permanent race track was not constructed until after the war, using communications roads built by the occupying German army. Contrary to popular belief [[John Hugenholtz]] cannot be credited with the design of the Zandvoort track, although he was involved as the chairman of the Nederlandse Automobiel Ren Club (Dutch Auto Racing Club) before becoming the first track director in 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.calameo.com/read/000374886fa8950ebb344|title=Grand Designs: John Hugenholtz |publisher=Grand Prix View |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref> Instead, it was 1927 Le Mans winner, [[S.

The [[1952 Dutch Grand Prix|1952 race]] was the first to be run as a round of the [[Formula One]] World Drivers' Championship, albeit to [[Formula Two]] regulations, which also applied in [[1953 Dutch Grand Prix|1953]]. There was no Dutch Grand Prix in 1954, 1956 or 1957, but 1955 saw the [[1955 Dutch Grand Prix|first proper Formula One race as part of the Drivers' Championship]]. The Dutch Grand Prix returned in [[1958 Dutch Grand Prix|1958]] and remained a permanent fixture on the F1 calendar (with the exception of 1972) until {{F1|1985}}, when it was held for the last time.\n\n===Mid 1980s to present===\n[[File:DTM Zandvoort, 2013 (10075032383).jpg|thumb|[[2013 Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|2013 DTM]] race in Zandvoort]]\n\nTo solve a number of problems that had made it impossible to develop and upgrade the track, the most important one being noise pollution for the inhabitants of the part of Zandvoort closest to the track, the track management adopted and developed a plan to move the most southern part of the track away from the housing estate and rebuild a more compact track in the remaining former 'infield'. In January 1987 this plan got the necessary 'green light' when it was formally approved by the Noord-Holland Provincial Council. However, only a couple of months later a new problem arose: the company that commercially ran the circuit (CENAV), called in the receiver and went out of business, marking the end of \"Circuit van Zandvoort\". \nAgain the track, owned by the municipality of Zandvoort, was in danger of being permanently lost for motorsports. However, a new operating company, the Stichting Exploitatie Circuit Park, was formed and started work at the realization of the track's reconstruction plans. Circuit Park Zandvoort was born and in the summer of 1989 the track was remodeled to an interim Club Circuit of {{convert|2.6|km|mi|sp=us}}, while the disposed southern part of the track was used to build a Vendorado Bungalow Park and new premises for the local football and hockey clubs.\n\nIn 1995, CPZ (''Circuit Park Zandvoort'') got the \"A Status\" of the Dutch government and began building an international Grand Prix Circuit. This project was finished in 2001 when, after the track was redesigned to a {{convert|4.3|km|mi|sp=us}} long circuit and a new pits building was realized (by HPG, the development company of John Hugenholtz jr, son of the former director), a new grandstand was situated along the long straight. One of the major events that is held at the circuit, along with DTM and A1GP, is the [[RTL Group|RTL]] [[Masters of Formula 3]], where [[Formula Three]] cars of several national racing series compete with each other (originally called Marlboro Masters, before tobacco advertising ban). A noise restriction order was responsible for this event moving to the Belgian [[Circuit Zolder]] for 2007 and 2008. However, the race returned to its historical home in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/72969|title=Masters to return to Zandvoort|publisher=autosport.com|date=2009-01-23|accessdate=2009-01-23}}</ref>\n\nCircuit Park Zandvoort played host to the first race in the [[2006-07 A1 Grand Prix season|2006/07 season]] of [[A1 Grand Prix]] from 29 September\u20131 October 2006. On 21 August 2008, the official A1GP site reported that the [[2008-09 A1 Grand Prix season|2008/09 season]]'s first race has moved from the [[Mugello Circuit]], [[Italy]] to Zandvoort on the 4\u20135 October 2008 due to the delay in the building the new chassis for the new race cars. The [[Dutch Supercar Challenge|Dutch]] round moved to [[TT Circuit Assen]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.a1gp.com/News/NewsArticle.aspx?newsId=44472|title=Dutch delight|publisher=a1gp.com|date=2009-08-10|accessdate=2009-08-27}}</ref> A1GP bankrupted before its fifth season and the Dutch round was replaced with Superleague Formula.\n\n==The circuit==\n[[File:Circuit Park Zandvoort from air 2016-08-24.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of the circuit in 2016]]\n[[File:Circuit Zandvoort 1.png|thumb|Map of the circuit]]\n\nThe circuit gained popularity because of its fast, sweeping corners such as Scheivlak as well as the \"Tarzanbocht\" (Tarzan corner) hairpin at the end of the start/finish straight. Tarzanbocht is the most famous corner in the circuit. Since there is a camber in the corner, it provides excellent overtaking opportunities. It is possible to pass around the outside as well as the easier inside lane.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.a1gp.com/Circuit/CircuitInfo.aspx?circuitId=9&seasonId=4|title=Circuit Park Zandvoort, The Netherlands|publisher=a1gp.com|date=n.d.|accessdate=2009-11-01}}</ref> This corner is reportedly named after a local character who had earned the nickname of [[Tarzan]] and only wanted to give up his vegetable garden in the dunes if the track's designers named a nearby corner after him.

The car then hit a small hill and rolled. It was later determined that Dik had suffered a fatal heart attack at the wheel of his car.\n|-\n| Wim Gerlach || June 10, 1957 || Wim Gerlach rolled his Porsche during a sportscar race at Zandvoort on 9 June 1957. The car was not equipped with a rollcage and Gerlach, who was not wearing seatbelts, had his head crushed between the door of the car and the earth bank. The corner where the accident occurred was later named the Gerlachbocht.\n|-\n| Werner Engel || April 30, 1958 || Crashed his Mercedes 300SL cabriolet during the final stage of that year's [[Tulip Rally]]. As was usual at the time, the Tulip Rally's final stage was run as a race at Zandvoort, but in anti-clockwise direction, so as to counter unfair advantages for drivers with racing experience of the track. Engel's car crashed and overturned on the back-stretch of the track, on the short straight leading away from Tunnel-Oost (in the direction of Scheivlak corner) and came to rest upside down on the track.\n|-\n| [[Ian Raby]] || November 7, 1967 || Seriously injured on 5th lap of the Zandvoort Grand Prix, 7th round of the 1967 European Formula 2 Championship.\n|-\n| Chris Lambert<!-- please do not link this to [[Chris Lambert]] (which is a disambiguation page) or [[Chris Lambert (racing driver)]], which redirects back to here --> || July 28, 1968 || Lambert was killed after he collided with Clay Regazzoni during the Dutch round of the European Formula 2 Championship, launching Lambert's Brabham BT23C over the guardrail and onto the pedestrian path below.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://8w.forix.com/nl73-nl70.html |title=8W \u2013 When? \u2013 1973 Dutch GP |publisher=Forix |accessdate=11 May 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[Piers Courage]] || June 21, 1970 || The suspension or steering in Courage's car broke on the flat out 'Tunnel Oost' section. Instead of rounding the bend, the car went straight on into the steep dunes, disintegrated on impact and caught fire as the engine broke away from the monocoque; automatic fuel-sealing equipment was not yet being used. During the impact one of the front wheels broke loose and hit Courage's head, taking off his helmet (wheel and helmet came rolling out of the cloud of dust simultaneously). It's assumed that Courage was killed instantly (or at least severely wounded and knocked unconscious) when the wheel hit him, rather than dying in the subsequent fire, as the monocoque was upright (not upside down, as is often stated by those who confuse the Courage and Williamson accidents) when it came to rest and did not seem to trap its driver in any way.\n|-\n| [[Roger Williamson]] || July 29, 1973 || Williamson lost control of his car due to a suspected tyre failure during the [[1973 Dutch Grand Prix]] and crashed into the barriers, spun upside-down and caught fire. [[David Purley]] stopped his own race and tried unsuccessfully to save Williamson. The circuit was poorly prepared and not enough extinguishers were on hand.\n|-\n| [[Rob Slotemaker]] || July 29, 1979 || Slotemaker was killed when he crashed his [[Chevrolet Camaro]] during the \"Trophy of the Dunes\" touring car race. His car spun on a patch of oil and collided with a course car parked alongside the track. Despite the relatively minor force of the accident, he suffered a broken neck and died instantly. A section of the circuit, the left-hander after Hunzerug, is named in his memory.<ref>The Straits Times, 18 September 1979, p.26</ref>\n|-\n| [[Hans-Georg B\u00fcrger]] || July 20, 1980 || Crashed in his Tiga F280-BMW at Scheivlak corner during the warm-up for the Grote Prijs van Zandvoort, the Dutch round of the European Formula 2 Championship. He succumbed to his head injuries in hospital two days later.\n|-\n| Alain Vinckx || May 25, 1987 || During a World Record Day event Vinckx was killed when he attempted a stunt in which he drove a [[Chevrolet Camaro]] through four buses placed back to back. The second bus was positioned too low, the roof of the car was cut from it by the roof of the bus. Vinckx was unable to duck away from danger and was decapitated. \n|-\n| Oliver Heimann || March 30, 1991 || Heimann was unable to avoid the car of another competitor which had come to a standstill. Heimann broke his neck in the accident, and he died in a hospital in Haarlem, Netherlands, about one hour after the crash.\n|-\n| Henk Schoorstra || July 29, 2010 || After colliding with another car, Henk Schoorstra's single-seater went out of control and crashed into the guard rail between Hunserug and the Rob Slotemaker bend. The driver was able to drive the car into the run-off area but it caught fire and Schoorstra was killed at the scene. \n|-\n| David Ferrer || September 2, 2017 || During the Historic Grand Prix Zandvoort Ferrer crashed with his March 701 from 1970. The accident happened in the Arie Luyendijkbocht where he lost control of the car and crashed into the barriers.

In [[France]], the first Christmas tree was introduced in 1840 by the [[Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|duchesse d'Orl\u00e9ans]]. In Denmark a Danish newspaper claims that the first attested Christmas tree was lit in 1808 by countess Wilhemine of Holsteinborg. It was the aging countess who told the story of the first Danish Christmas tree to the Danish writer [[Hans Christian Andersen]] in 1865. He had published a fairy-tale called ''[[The Fir-Tree]]'' in 1844, recounting the fate of a fir-tree being used as a Christmas tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |work=Kristelig Dagblad |title=Danmarks f\u00f8rste juletr\u00e6 blev t\u00e6ndt i 1808 |date=December 17, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213095846/http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/artikel/307946:Kronik--Danmarks-foerste-juletrae-blev-taendt-i-1808 |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n====Britain====\n[[File:Christmas Tree 1848.jpg|thumb|An engraving published in the 1840s of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] created a craze for Christmas trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/12068658/Queens-Christmas-Day-message-Monarch-quotes-from-Bible-to-address-a-nation-shaken-by-year-of-atrocities.html |title=Queen's Christmas Day message: Monarch quotes from Bible to address a nation shaken by year of atrocities |last=Bingham |first=John |date=25 December 2015 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |publisher= |accessdate=25 December 2017 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171227124150/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/12068658/Queens-Christmas-Day-message-Monarch-quotes-from-Bible-to-address-a-nation-shaken-by-year-of-atrocities.html |archive-date=2017-12-27 |dead-url=no |df= }}</ref>]]\n[[File:Albert Chevallier Tayler - The Christmas Tree 1911.jpg|thumb|The Christmas Tree 1911 by [[Albert Chevallier Tayler]]]]\nAlthough the tradition of decorating the home with evergreens was long established,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/42959/42959-h/42959-h.htm#Footnote_213_213|title=Survey of London|last=Stow|first=John|publisher=John Windet|year=1603|isbn=|location=London|pages=|quote=\"Against the feast of Christmas every man's house, as also the parish churches, were decked with holm, ivy, bays, and whatsoever the season of the year afforded to be green.\"|via=|access-date=2017-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170816193124/http://www.gutenberg.org/files/42959/42959-h/42959-h.htm#Footnote_213_213|archive-date=2017-08-16|dead-url=no|df=}}</ref> the custom of decorating an entire small tree was unknown in Britain until some two centuries ago.

The first decorated trees were adorned with apples, white candy canes and pastries in the shapes of stars, hearts and flowers.  [[Glass]] baubles were first made in [[Lauscha]], [[Germany]],  and also garlands of glass beads and [[tin]] figures that could be hung on trees. The popularity of these decorations grew into the production of glass figures made by highly skilled [[artisans]] with [[clay]] molds.\n\nTinsel and several types of garland or ribbon are commonly used to decorate a Christmas tree. Silvered [[saran (plastic)|saran]]-based tinsel was introduced later. Delicate mold-blown and painted colored glass Christmas ornaments were a specialty of the glass factories in the [[Thuringian Forest]], especially in [[Lauscha]] in the late 19th century, and have since become a large industry, complete with famous-name designers. Baubles are another common decoration, consisting of small hollow glass or plastic spheres coated with a thin metallic layer to make them reflective, with a further coating of a thin pigmented polymer in order to provide coloration.\nLighting with electric lights (Christmas lights or, in the United Kingdom, fairy lights) is commonly done. A [[tree-topper]], sometimes an angel but more frequently a star, completes the decoration.\n\nIn the late 1800s, home-made white Christmas trees were made by wrapping strips of cotton batting around leafless branches creating the appearance of a snow-laden tree.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, popularized by Hollywood films in the late 1930s,  [[flocking (texture)|flocking]] was very popular on the [[West Coast of the United States]]. There were home flocking kits that could be used with vacuum cleaners.

Less-traditional conifers are sometimes used, such as [[Sequoiadendron giganteum|giant sequoia]], [[Leyland cypress]], [[Cupressus macrocarpa|Monterey cypress]] and [[Juniperus virginiana|eastern juniper]]. Various types of [[spruce]] tree are also used for Christmas trees (including the [[Picea pungens|blue spruce]] and, less commonly, the [[Picea glauca|white spruce]]); but spruces begin to lose their needles rapidly upon being cut, and spruce needles are often sharp, making decorating uncomfortable. [[Pinus virginiana|Virginia pine]] is still available on some tree farms in the southeastern United States; however, its winter color is faded. The long-needled [[Pinus strobus|eastern white pine]] is also used there, though it is an unpopular Christmas tree in most parts of the country, owing also to its faded winter coloration and limp branches, making decorating difficult with all but the lightest ornaments. Norfolk Island pine is sometimes used, particularly in [[Oceania]], and in [[Australia]], some species of the genera ''[[Casuarina]]'' and ''[[Allocasuarina]]'' are also occasionally used as Christmas trees. But, by far, the most common tree is the [[Pinus radiata|Monterey pine]]. ''[[Adenanthos sericeus]]'' or Albany woolly bush is commonly sold in southern Australia as a potted living Christmas tree. [[Tsuga|Hemlock]] species are generally considered unsuitable as Christmas trees due to their poor needle retention and inability to support the weight of lights and ornaments.\n\nSome trees, frequently referred to as \"living Christmas trees\", are sold live with roots and soil, often from a [[plant nursery]], to be stored at nurseries in planters or planted later outdoors and enjoyed (and often decorated) for years or decades. Others are produced in a container and sometimes as [[topiary]] for a porch or patio. However, when done improperly, the combination of root loss caused by digging, and the indoor environment of high temperature and low humidity is very detrimental to the tree's health; additionally, the warmth of an indoor climate will bring the tree out of its natural winter [[dormancy]], leaving it little protection when put back outside into a cold outdoor climate. Often Christmas trees are a large attraction for living animals, including mice and spiders. Thus, the survival rate of these trees is low.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |title=Living Christmas Trees |publisher=[[Clemson University]] |accessdate=July 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606222650/https://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/plants/other/seasonal/hgic1751.html |archive-date=2010-06-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}</ref> However, when done properly, replanting provides higher survival rates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |title=Christmas tree |publisher=Department of Forestry, [[Michigan State University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315150004/http://www.for.msu.edu/extension/ExtDocs/xmastree.htm |archivedate=15 March 2012 }}</ref>\n\nEuropean tradition prefers the open aspect of naturally grown, unsheared trees, while in North America (outside western areas where trees are often wild-harvested on public lands)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |title=BLM and Forest Service Christmas tree permits available |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=November 30, 2004 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114174843/http://www.blm.gov/co/st/en/BLM_Information/newsroom/2004/blm_and_forest_service0.html |archive-date=2014-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> there is a preference for close-sheared trees with denser foliage, but less space to hang decorations.\n\nIn the past, Christmas trees were often harvested from wild forests, but now almost all are commercially grown on [[tree farm]]s.

This discrepancy was corrected in 1918, by the fledgling Bolshevik regime, but Christmas never reverted to December 25th in Russia, because the Bolsheviks began a systematic campaign to phase out traditional religious holidays and replace them with Soviet ones. Christmas was shifted to New Year's Eve.

The first naval [[task force]]s built around carriers appeared just prior to and during World War II. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], IJN, was the first to assemble a large number of carriers into a single task force, known as [[Kido Butai]]. This task force was used with devastating effect in the Imperial Japanese Navy's [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. [[Kido Butai]] operated as the IJN's main carrier battle group until four of its carriers were sunk at the [[Battle of Midway]]. In contrast, the United States Navy deployed its large carriers in separate formations, with each carrier assigned its own cruiser and destroyer escorts. These single-carrier formations would often be paired or grouped together for certain assignments, most notably the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] and Midway. By 1943, however, large numbers of fleet and light carriers became available, which required larger formations of three or four carriers. These groups eventually formed the [[Fast Carrier Task Force]], which became the primary battle unit of the U.S. Fifth and Third Fleets.\n\nWith the construction of the large 'super carriers' of the Cold War era, the practice of operating each carrier in a single formation was revived. During the [[Cold War]], the main role of the CVBG in case of conflict with the [[Soviet Union]] would have been to protect Atlantic supply routes between the United States and Europe, while the role of the [[Soviet Navy]] would have been to interrupt these sea lanes, a fundamentally easier task. Because the Soviet Union had no large carriers of its own, a situation of dueling aircraft carriers would have been unlikely. However, a primary mission of the Soviet Navy's [[attack submarine]]s was to track every allied battle group and, on the outbreak of hostilities, sink the carriers. Understanding this threat, the CVBG expended enormous resources in its own [[anti-submarine warfare]] mission.\n\n==Carrier battle groups in crises==\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, most of the uses of carrier battle groups by the United States as well as that of other nations have been in situations in which their use has been uncontested by other comparable forces. During the [[Cold War]], an important battle scenario was an attack against a CVBG using a large number of [[antiship missile]]s.\n\n===1956 Suez Crisis===\nBritish and French carrier battle groups were involved in the [[1956 Suez Crisis]].\n\n===1971 Indo-Pakistan war===\nDuring the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani war of 1971]], India used its carrier strike group centered on {{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}} to impose a naval blockade upon East Pakistan. Air strikes were carried out initially on shipping in the Chittagong and Cox's Bazar harbors, sinking or incapacitating most ships there. Further strikes were carried out on Cox's Bazar from 60 nautical miles (110&nbsp;km) offshore. On the evening of 4 December, the air group struck Chittagong Harbour. Later strikes targeted Khulna and the Port of Mongla. Air strikes continued until 10 December 1971.\n\n===1982 Falklands War===\n{{multiple image\n|footer = Both {{ship|ARA|Veinticinco de Mayo|V-2|6}} and {{HMS|Invincible|R05|6}} took part in the [[Falklands War]].\n|total_width = 450\n\n|image1 = ARA25mayo 1979 DN-SN-82-09623.jpg\n|width1 = 1024\n|height1 = 718\n|alt1 = ARA ''Veinticinco de Mayo''\n\n|image2 = HMS Invincible (R05) Norfolk.jpg\n|width2 = 2820\n|height2 = 1850\n|alt2 = HMS ''Invincible''\n}}\n\nThe first attempted use of anti-ship missiles against a carrier battle group was part of [[Argentina]]'s efforts against [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]]. This was the last conflict so far in which opposing belligerents employed aircraft carriers, although Argentina made little use of [[ARA Veinticinco de Mayo (V-2)|its sole carrier]], originally built in the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Lebanon===\nThe [[United States Sixth Fleet]] assembled a force of three carrier battle groups and a [[battleship]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] in 1983. Daily reconnaissance flights were flown over the [[Bekaa Valley]] and a strike was flown against targets in the area resulting in loss of an [[A-6 Intruder]] and an [[A-7 Corsair II|A-7 Corsair]].\n\n===Gulf of Sidra===\nCarrier battle groups routinely operated in the [[Gulf of Sidra]] inside the \"[[Line of Death]]\" proclaimed by [[Libya]] resulting in aerial engagements in 1981, 1986 and 1989 between U.S. Navy Tomcats and Libyan [[Su-22]] aircraft, [[SA-5 Gammon|SA-5]] surface-to-air missiles and [[MiG-23]] fighters. During the 1986 clashes, three carrier battle groups deployed to the Gulf of Sidra and ultimately two of them conducted strikes against Libya in [[Operation El Dorado Canyon]].\n\n===2011 military intervention in Libya===\nDuring the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|international military intervention]] in the [[2011 Libyan civil war]], the [[French Navy]] deployed its aircraft carrier, {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle|R91|2}}, off [[Libya]]. The ''Charles de Gaulle'' was accompanied by several frigates as {{ship|French frigate|Forbin|D620|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Dupleix|D641|2}}, {{ship|French frigate|Aconit|F 713|2}}, the replenishment tanker ''[[Durance-class tanker|Meuse]]'' and two {{sclass-|Rubis|submarine|0}} nuclear attack submarines.<ref>http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=6007194&c=EUR&s=AIR</ref>\n\n==U.S. Navy Battle Groups==\n\n===Carrier strike group===\n[[Image:George Washington Carrier Strike Group.jpg|thumb|USS ''George Washington'' [[Carrier strike group]] sails in formation for a strike group photo in the [[Caribbean Sea]] April 29, 2006.

The US Navy maintains 11 carrier strike groups,{{clarify timeframe|date=March 2016}} 9 of which are based in the United States and one that is forward deployed in Japan. CSG or CVBG normally consist of 1 Aircraft Carrier, 1 Guided Missile Cruiser (for Air Defense), 2 LAMPS (Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System) Capable Warships (focusing on Anti-Submarine and Surface Warfare), and 1\u20132 Anti Submarine Destroyers or Frigates.<ref>{{cite web|author=USS George Washington Public Affairs|url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=39259|title=USS George Washington Departs for Japan|publisher=Navy.mil|date=2008-08-21|accessdate=2012-11-02}}</ref> The large number of CSGs used by the United States reflects, in part, a division of roles and missions allotted during the Cold War, in which the United States assumed primary responsibility for [[blue-water navy|blue water]] operations and for safeguarding supply lines between the United States and [[Europe]], while the [[NATO]] allies assumed responsibility for [[brown-water navy|brown]] and [[green-water navy|green water]] operations.\n\n===Expeditionary Strike Group===\nAn [[Expeditionary Strike Group]] is composed of an [[Amphibious Assault Ship]] (LHA/LHD), a [[Dock Landing Ship]] (LSD), an [[Amphibious transport dock]] (LPD), a [[Marine expeditionary unit]], [[McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier II]] aircraft, [[Sikorsky CH-53E Super Stallion|CH-53E Super Stallion]] helicopters and [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|CH-46E Sea Knight]] helicopters or, more recently, [[Bell Boeing V-22 Osprey|MV-22B]] tiltrotors. Cruisers, destroyers and attack submarines are deployed with either an Expeditionary Strike Group or a Carrier Strike Group.\n\n===Battleship battle group===\nDuring the period when the American navy recommissioned all four of its {{sclass-|Iowa|battleship}}s, it sometimes used a similar formation centered on a [[battleship]], referred to as a '''battleship battle group''' (BBBG). It was alternately referred to as a Surface Action Group (SAG).\n\nThe battleship battle group typically consisted of one modernized battleship, one {{sclass-|Ticonderoga|cruiser}}, one {{sclass-|Kidd|destroyer}} or {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer|2}}, one {{sclass-|Spruance|destroyer|2}}, three {{sclass-|Oliver Hazard Perry|frigate}}s and one support ship, such as a fleet oiler.<ref>Lightbody and Poyer, pp. 338\u2013339.</ref>\n\n==Carrier battle groups of other countries==\n{{Original research|section|date=November 2008}}\n\n===China===\nChina plans to set up several carrier battle groups in the future. At present China's only aircraft carrier, the [[Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning|CNS ''Liaoning'']] uses [[Type 052C]] or [[Type 052D]] destroyers for air defense, [[Type 054A]] frigates for anti-submarine and anti-ship warfare, 1-2 [[Type 093]] Shang nuclear submarines and 1 supply ship.\nChina launched its second carrier in April 2017.

The commanding officer of the air group (usually a capitaine de fr\u00e9gate\u2014equivalent to commander) is subordinate to the commanding officer of the aircraft carrier, a senior captain. The escort destroyers (called frigates in the French denomination) are commanded by more junior captains.\n\nFrance also operates three {{sclass-|Mistral|amphibious assault ship|2}}s. While incapable of operating fixed-winged aircraft, they function as helicopter carriers and form the backbone of France's amphibious force. These ships are typically escorted by the same escorts the ''Charles De Gaulle'' uses.\n\n===India===\n[[File:Indian Navy flotilla of Western Fleet escort INS Vikramaditya (R33) and INS Viraat (R22) in the Arabian Sea.jpg|thumb|A flotilla from the Indian Navy's [[Western Naval Command|Western Fleet]] escorts the aircraft carriers [[INS Viraat (R22)|INS ''Viraat'']] and [[INS Vikramaditya (R33)|INS ''Vikramaditya'']] through the Arabian Sea in 2014.]] \nThe [[Indian Navy]] has been operating carrier battle groups since 1961, with its first carrier battle group formed around the now decommissioned [{{INS|Vikrant|R11|6}}.<ref name=ht9j14>{{cite news|title=INS Vikramaditya will create waves for India |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |accessdate=9 January 2014 |newspaper=Hindustan Times |date=9 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109051144/http://www.hindustantimes.com/comment/analysis/ins-vikramaditya-will-create-waves-for-india/article1-1170772.aspx |archivedate=9 January 2014 |df= }}</ref> As of 2017, the Indian Navy operates one carrier battle group centered on {{INS|Vikramaditya}}.

Specialized ships were developed to provide underway replenishment of fuel (for the carrier and its aircraft), ordnance, and other supplies necessary to sustain operations. Carrier battle groups devote a great deal of planning to efficiently conduct [[underway replenishment]] to minimize the time spent conducting replenishment. The carrier can also provide replenishment on a limited basis to its escorts, but typically a replenishment ship such as a [[fast combat support ship]] (AOE) or [[replenishment oiler]] (AOR) pulls alongside a carrier and conducts simultaneous operations with the carrier on its port side and one of the escorts on its starboard side. The advent of the helicopter provides the ability to speed replenishment by lifting supplies at the same time that fueling hoses and lines are delivering other goods.\n\n==Debate on future viability==\nThere is debate in naval warfare circles as to the viability of carrier battle groups in 21st century naval warfare. Proponents of the CVBG argue that it provides unmatched firepower and force projection capabilities. Opponents argue that CVBGs are increasingly vulnerable to [[arsenal ship]]s and [[cruise missile]]s, especially those with [[supersonic]] or even hypersonic flight<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sploid.gizmodo.com/are-the-us-navy-supercarriers-useless-1484497670|title=The future of naval warfare: Are US supercarriers useless?|first=Jesus|last=Diaz|publisher=|accessdate=27 August 2017}}</ref> and the ability to perform radical trajectory changes to avoid anti-missile systems. It is also noted that CVBGs were designed for Cold War scenarios, and are less useful in establishing control of areas close to shore. It is argued however that such missiles and arsenal ships pose no serious threat as they would be eliminated due to increasing improvement in ship defenses such as [[Cooperative Engagement Capability]] (CEC), DEW technology and missile technology.\n\nHowever, carriers have been called upon to be first responders even when conventional land based aircraft were employed. During Desert Shield, the U.S. Navy sortied additional carriers to augment the on station assets eventually maintaining six carriers for [[Desert Storm]]. Although the U.S. Air Force sent fighters such as the [[F-16]] to theater in Desert Shield, they had to carry bombs with them as no stores were in place for sustained operations, whereas the carriers arrived on scene with full magazines and had support ships to allow them to conduct strikes indefinitely.\n\nThe [[War on Terrorism|Global War on Terror]] has shown the flexibility and responsiveness of the carrier on multiple occasions when land based air was not feasible or able to respond in a timely fashion. After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] on the U.S., carriers immediately headed to the Arabian Sea to support [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and took up station, building to a force of three carriers. Their steaming location was closer to the targets in Afghanistan than any land based assets and thereby more responsive. The {{USS|Kitty Hawk|CV-63|6}} was adapted to be a support base for [[special operations]] helicopters. Carriers were used again in [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and even provided aircraft to be based ashore on occasion and have done so periodically when special capabilities are needed. This precedent was established during [[World War II]] in the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]].\n\nRegardless of the debate over viability, the United States has made a major investment in the development of a new carrier class\u2014the {{sclass-|Gerald R. Ford|aircraft carrier|}}s (formerly designated CVN-X, or the X Carrier)\u2014to replace the existing {{sclass-|Nimitz|aircraft carrier}}s. The new ''Ford''-class carriers are designed to be modular and are easily adaptable as technology and equipment needed on board changes.<ref>[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ship/cvx.htm CVX Next Generation Aircraft Carrier], globalsecurity.org</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Amphibious ready group]]\n*[[Expeditionary Strike Group]]\n*[[Naval tactics]]\n*[[U.S. Carrier Group tactics]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite journal |last= Morua |first= Michael L. |date= 21 March 2000 |title= The Carrier Battle Group Force: An Operator's Perspective |journal= Engineering the Total Ship (ETS) 2000 Symposium |publisher= [[National Institute of Standards & Technology]]|location= [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]] |id= ADA376409 |url= http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA376409&Location=U2&doc=GetTRDoc.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= 2010-10-28 |quote=}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Naval units}}\n* [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/batgru.htm Carrier Battle Group] \u2013 GlobalSecurity.org\n* [http://gonavy.jp/CVLocation.html Current global location of active, proposed, and decommissioned carriers]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carrier Battle Group}}\n[[Category:Escort ships| ]]\n[[Category:Aircraft carriers]]\n[[Category:Naval warfare]]", "sha1": "mgulu1dj9uhh03uwpegps62cy62kngi"}}, {"title": "Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight", "ns": "0", "id": "7773", "revision": {"id": "863432659", "parentid": "863393331", "timestamp": "2018-10-10T18:47:29Z", "contributor": {"username": "Fnlayson", "id": "1216158"}, "comment": "/* Notable accidents and incidents */ \"troops\" seems more fitting for military members, adjust/shorten some wording", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Sea Knight|the mythological creature also named sea knight|Zitiron}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2013}}\n<!-- This article is a part of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Aircraft]].

It was designed by [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol]] and manufactured by [[Boeing Helicopters|Boeing Vertol]] following Vertol's acquisition by [[Boeing]].\n\nDevelopment of the Sea Knight, which was originally designated by the firm as the '''Vertol Model 107''', commenced during 1956. It was envisioned as a successor to the first generation of rotorcraft, such as the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] \"Flying Banana\", that had been powered by [[Reciprocating engine|piston engines]]; in its place, the '''V-107''' made use of the emergent [[turboshaft]] engine. On 22 April 1958, the V-107 prototype performed its [[maiden flight]]. During June 1958, the US Army awarded a contract for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft, designated as the '''YHC-1A''', based on the V-107; this initial order was later cut down to three YHC-1As though. During 1961, the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]] (USMC), who had been studying its requirements for a medium-lift, twin-turbine cargo/troop assault helicopter, selected Boeing Vertol's '''Model 107M''' as the basis from which to manufacture a suitable rotorcraft to meet their needs. Known colloquially as the \"Phrog\" and formally as the \"Sea Knight\", it was operated across all US Marine Corps' operational environments between its introduction during the [[Vietnam War]] and its frontline retirement during 2014.\n \nThe Sea Knight was operated by the USMC to provide all-weather, day-or-night assault transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment until it was replaced by the [[MV-22 Osprey]] during the 2010s. The USMC also used the helicopter for [[combat support#United States Marine Corps|combat support]], [[search and rescue]] (SAR), [[CASEVAC|casualty evacuation]] and Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP). The Sea Knight also functioned as the [[US Navy]]'s standard medium-lift [[utility helicopter]] prior to the type being phased out of service in favor of the [[MH-60S Knighthawk]] during the early 2000s. Several overseas operators acquired the rotorcraft as well. [[Canada]] operated the Sea Knight, designated as '''CH-113'''; the type was used predominantly in the [[search and rescue]] (SAR) role until 2004. Other export customers for the type included [[Japan]], [[Sweden]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The commercial version of the rotorcraft is the '''BV 107-II''', commonly referred to simply as the \"Vertol\".\n\n==Development==\n===Origins===\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, American rotorcraft manufacturer [[Piasecki Helicopter]] emerged as a pioneering developer of [[Tandem rotors|tandem-rotor]] helicopters; perhaps the most famous of these being the piston-powered [[Piasecki H-21|H-21]] \"Flying Banana\", an early utility and transport helicopter. During 1955, Piasecki was officially renamed as [[Piasecki Helicopter|Vertol]] (standing for [[VTOL|vertical take-off and landing]]); it was around this time that work commenced on the development of a new generation of tandem rotor helicopter. During 1956, the new design received the internal company designation of ''Vertol Model 107'', or simply ''V-107''; this rotorcraft differed from its predecessors by harnessing the newly developed [[turboshaft]] engine instead of piston-based counterparts. During that year, construction of a prototype, powered by a pair of [[Lycoming T53]] [[turboshaft]] engines, each one being capable of producing 877 shp (640&nbsp;kW), commenced.<ref name=Apostolo>Apostolo, Giorgio. \"Boeing Vertol Model 107\".

During June 1958, it was announced that the U.S. Army had awarded a contract to Vertol for the construction of ten production-standard aircraft based on the V-107, which were designated ''YHC-1A''.<ref name=\"whirly\">Spenser, Jay P. ''Whirlybirds, A History of the U.S. Helicopter Pioneers''. University of Washington Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-295-97699-3}}.</ref> However, this order was later decreased to three helicopters; according to aviation author Jay P. Spenser, the cutback had been enacted in order that the U.S. Army would be able to divert funds for the development of the rival ''V-114'' helicopter, which was also a turbine-powered tandem rotor design but substantially larger than the V-107.<ref name=\"whirly\"/> All of the U.S. Army's three YHC-1As were powered by pairs of [[General Electric T58|GE-T-58]] engines. During August 1959, the first YHC-1A-model rotorcraft conducted its first flight; independently, it was shortly followed by the maiden flight of an improved model intended for the commercial and export markets, designated ''107-II''.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\">[http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm CH-46 history page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202119/http://www.history.navy.mil/planes/ch46.htm |date=3 December 2007 }}.

During November 1964, the introduction of the Marines' CH-46A and the Navy's UH-46As commenced. The UH-46A variant was a modified version of the rotorcraft to perform the [[vertical replenishment]] mission.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/> The CH-46A was equipped with a pair of T58-GE8-8B turboshaft engines, each being rated at 1,250 shp (930&nbsp;kW); these allowed the Sea Knight to carry up to 17 passengers or a maximum of 4,000 pounds (1,815&nbsp;kg) of cargo.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/>\n\n===Further developments===\nDuring 1966, production of the improved ''CH-46D'' commenced with deliveries following shortly thereafter.

It was typically powered by a pair of [[General Electric T58]] [[turboshaft]] engines, which were mounted on each side of the rear rotor pedestal; power to the forward rotor was transferred from the rear-mounted engines via a [[drive shaft]]. For redundancy, both engines are coupled so that either one would be capable of powering both of the main rotors in the event of a single engine failure or a similar emergency situation. Each of the rotors feature three [[rotor blade|blade]]s, which can be folded to better facilitate storage and naval operations.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\">[http://www.airvectors.net/avch47_1.html \"Boeing Sea Knight\"]. Vectorsite.net, 1 August 2011.</ref> The CH-46 features a fixed [[tricycle landing gear]], complete with twin wheels on all three legs of the landing gear; this configuration results in a nose-up stance, helping to facilitate cargo loading and unloading. Two of the main landing gear were installed within protruding rear [[sponson]]s; the free interior space of the sponsons are also used to house fuel tanks, possessing a total capacity of 350 US gallons (1,438 L).<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/>\n\nThe interior of the CH-46 was largely taken up by its cargo bay, complete with a rear loading ramp that could be removed or left open in flight for the carriage of extended cargoes or for parachute drops. Various furnishings were normally provided to aid in its use as a utility rotorcraft, such as an internal [[winch]] mounted within the forward cabin, which can be used to assisting loading by pulling external cargo on [[pallet]]s into the aircraft via the ramp and rollers, and an optionally-attached belly-mounted [[Cargo hook (helicopter)|cargo hook]], which would be usually rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} for carrying cargoes externally underneath the Sea Knight; despite the hook having been rated at {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}}, this was safety restricted to less payload as they got older. When operated in a typical configuration, the CH-46 would usually be operated by a crew of three; a larger crew could be accommodated when required, which would be dependent upon mission specifics. For example, a [[search and rescue]] (SAR) variant would usually carry a crew of five (Pilot, Co-Pilot, Crew Chief, Swimmer, and Medic) to facilitate all aspects of such operations. For self-defense, a [[pintle]]-mounted [[M2 Browning|0.50 in (12.7&nbsp;mm) Browning]] [[machine gun]] could be mounted on each side of the helicopter.<ref name=\"vect_CH-46\"/> Service in southeast Asia resulted in the addition of [[armor]] along with the machine guns.<ref name=\"CH-46_hist_USN\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\n\n===United States===\n[[File:CH-46 Shot down during Operation Hastings.jpg|thumb|A flaming Marine CH-46 of HMM-265, after being hit by enemy AAA fire in \"Helicopter Valley\", 15 July 1966.<ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Tim |date=23 April 2012 |title=Vietnam's Helicopter Valley: Graveyard of Marine CH-46's |url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/april232012/helicopter-valley-tk.php |newspaper=Salem-News.com |location=Salem, OR |accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>]]\n\nKnown colloquially as the \"Phrog\", the Sea Knight was used in all U.S. Marine operational environments between its introduction during the [[Vietnam War]] and its frontline retirement in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helis.com/60s/h_h46.php|title=Boeing Vertol 107 \u2013 CH-46 Sea Knight|publisher=Helis.com|work=Helicopter History Site}}</ref> The type's longevity and reputation for reliability led to mantras such as \"phrogs phorever\" and \"never trust a helicopter under 30\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ask A Marine|publisher=HMM-364 Purple Foxy Ladies|url=http://www.purplefoxyladies.com/ask.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230060309/http://purplefoxyladies.com/ask.html|archivedate=30 December 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref> CH-46s transported personnel, evacuated wounded, supplied forward arming and refueling points (FARP), performed vertical replenishment, search and rescue, recovered downed aircraft and crews and other tasks.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the CH-46 was one of the prime US troop transport helicopters in the theatre, slotting between the smaller [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] and larger [[Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion]].

In a separate capacity as a member of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] ({{UnitedStatesCode|10|151}}) the CNO is a military adviser to the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], the [[United States Homeland Security Council|Homeland Security Council]], the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], and the [[President of the United States|President]]. The current Chief of Naval Operations is [[John M. Richardson (admiral)|Admiral John M. Richardson]].\n\nDespite the title, the CNO does not have operational command authority over Naval forces. The CNO is an administrative position based in [[the Pentagon]], and exercises supervision of Navy organizations as the designee of the Secretary of the Navy. Operational command of naval forces falls within the purview of the [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commanders]] who report to the Secretary of Defense.\n\n==Responsibilities==\nThe Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is typically the highest-ranking officer on [[active duty]] in the U.S. Navy unless the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman]] and/or the [[Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] are naval officers.<ref name=\"a\"/>\n\nAs per {{UnitedStatesCode|10|5035}}, whenever there is a vacancy for the Chief of Naval Operations or during the absence or disability of the Chief of Naval Operations, and unless the President directs otherwise, the [[Vice Chief of Naval Operations]] performs the duties of the Chief of Naval Operations until a successor is appointed or the absence or disability ceases.<ref>{{cite web |title=10 USC 5035.

Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (other than the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]]) may submit to the Chairman advice or an opinion in disagreement with, or advice or an opinion in addition to, the advice presented by the Chairman to the President, NSC, or SECDEF.\n\nWhen performing his JCS duties, the CNO is responsible directly to the SECDEF, but keeps SECNAV fully informed of significant military operations affecting the duties and responsibilities of the SECNAV, unless SECDEF orders otherwise.<ref>{{cite web |title=10 USC 5033.

It was historically associated with a squat [[bottle]] enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''[[fiasco (bottle)|fiasco]]'' (\"flask\"; ''pl. fiaschi''). However, the ''fiasco'' is only used by a few makers of the wine as most Chianti is now bottled in more standard shaped wine bottles. [[Baron]] [[Bettino Ricasoli]] (later [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]] of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]]) created the Chianti recipe of 70% [[Sangiovese]], 15% [[Canaiolo]] and 15% [[Malvasia|Malvasia bianca]] in the middle of the 19th century.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\">J. Robinson (ed) ''\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\"'' Third Edition  pg 162-163 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}</ref>\n\nThe first definition of a wine-area called ''Chianti'' was made in 1716. It described the area near the villages of [[Gaiole (Chianti)|Gaiole]], [[Castellina (Chianti)|Castellina]] and [[Radda (Chianti)|Radda]]; the so-called ''Lega del Chianti'' and later ''Provincia del Chianti'' (Chianti province). In 1932 the Chianti area was completely re-drawn and divided in seven sub-areas: Classico, Colli Aretini, Colli Fiorentini, Colline Pisane, Colli Senesi, Montalbano and R\u00f9fina. Most of the villages that in 1932 were suddenly included in the new Chianti Classico area added ''in Chianti'' to their name-such as [[Greve in Chianti]] which amended its name in 1972. Wines labelled \"Chianti Classico\" come from the biggest sub-area of Chianti, that includes the original Chianti heartland. Only Chianti from this sub-zone may boast the black rooster seal (known in Italian as a ''gallo nero'') on the neck of the bottle, which indicates that the producer of the wine is a member of the Chianti Classico Consortium, the local association of producers.<ref>Consorzio del Marchio Storico</ref><ref>Consorzio del vino Chianti Classico</ref>  Other variants, with the exception of Rufina from the north-east side of [[Florence]] and Montalbano in the south of [[Pistoia]], originate in the respective named provinces: [[Province of Siena|Siena]] for the Colli Senesi, [[Province of Florence|Florence]] for the Colli Fiorentini, [[Province of Arezzo|Arezzo]] for the Colli Aretini and [[Province of Pisa|Pisa]] for the Colline Pisane. In 1996 part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-area was renamed ''Montespertoli''.\n\nDuring the 1970s producers started to reduce the quantity of white grapes in Chianti. In 1995 it became legal to produce a Chianti with 100% Sangiovese. For a wine to retain the name of Chianti, it must be produced with at least 80% Sangiovese grapes.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\">M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy ''Italian Wines for Dummies'' pg 147-159 Hungry Minds 2001 {{ISBN|0-7645-5355-0}}</ref> Aged Chianti (38 months instead of 4\u20137) may be labelled as Riserva. Chianti that meets more stringent requirements (lower yield, higher alcohol content and dry extract) may be labelled as [[Chianti Superiore]], although Chianti from the \"Classico\" sub-area is not allowed in any event to be labelled as \"Superiore\".\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Chianti}}\n\n[[File:Grand Duke CosimoIII of Tuscany by van Douven.jpg|left|thumb|150px|left|In 1716 Cosimo III de' Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, legislated the first official boundaries of the Chianti region in what is today part of the Chianti Classico DOCG.]]\n\nThe earliest documentation of a \"Chianti wine\" dates back to the 13th century when viticulture was known to flourish in the ''\"Chianti Mountains\"'' around Florence. The merchants in the nearby townships of Castellina, Gaiole and Radda formed the ''Lega del Chianti'' (League of Chianti) to produce and promote the local wine. In 1398, records note that the earliest incarnation of Chianti was as a white wine.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/> In 1716 [[Cosimo III de' Medici]], Grand Duke of Tuscany issued an edict legislating that the three villages of the ''Lega del Chianti'' ([[Castellina in Chianti]], [[Gaiole in Chianti]] and [[Radda in Chianti]]) as well as the village of [[Greve (Chianti)|Greve]] and a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=mid|-long stretch|abbr=off|order=flip}} of hillside north of Greve near [[:it:Spedaluzzo|Spedaluzzo]] as the only officially recognised producers of Chianti. This delineation existed until July 1932, when the Italian government expanded the Chianti zone to include the outlying areas of [[Barberino Val d'Elsa]], [[Chiocchio]], [[:it:Robbiano|Robbiano]], [[San Casciano in Val di Pesa]] and [[:it:Strada in Chianti|Strada]]. Subsequent expansions in 1967 would eventually bring the Chianti zone to cover a very large area all over central Tuscany.\n\n[[File:Bettino Ricasoli.jpg|150px|thumb|Baron [[Bettino Ricasoli]] developed the first \"modern\" Chianti recipe that was Sangiovese based.]]\n\nBy the 18th century, Chianti was widely recognised as a red wine, but the exact composition and grape varieties used to make Chianti at this point is unknown. [[Ampelographer]]s find clues about which grape varieties were popular at the time in the writings of Italian writer [[Cosimo Villifranchi]] who noted that [[Canaiolo]] was widely planted variety in the area along with Sangiovese, [[Mammolo]] and [[Marzemino]].<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/> It was not until the work of the Italian statesman [[Bettino Ricasoli]] that the modern \"Chianti recipe\" as a Sangiovese-based wine would take shape.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 414-420\">H. Johnson ''Vintage: The Story of Wine'' pg 414-420 Simon and Schuster 1989 {{ISBN|0-671-68702-6}}</ref> Prior to Ricasoli, Canaiolo was emerging as the dominant variety in the Chianti blend with Sangiovese and [[Malvasia]] playing supporting roles. In the mid-19th century, Ricasoli developed a recipe for Chianti that was based primarily on Sangiovese. His recipe called for 70% Sangiovese, 15% Canaiolo, 10% Malvasia (later amended to include [[Trebbiano]]) and 5% other local red varieties. In 1967, the Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regulation set by the Italian government firmly established the \"Ricasoli formula\" of a Sangiovese-based blend with 10\u201330% Malvasia and Trebbiano.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe late 19th century saw a period of economic and political upheaval. First came [[Uncinula necator|oidium]] and then the [[phylloxera epidemic]] would take its toll on the vineyards of Chianti just as they had ravaged vineyards across the rest of Europe. The chaos and poverty following the ''[[Risorgimento]]'' heralded the beginning of the [[Italian diaspora]] that would take Italian vineyard workers and winemakers abroad as immigrants to new lands.<ref name=\"Johnson pg 414-420\"/> Those that stayed behind and replanted choose high-yielding varieties like [[Trebbiano]] and Sangiovese clones such as the ''Sangiovese di Romagna'' from the nearby [[Romagna]] region. Following the [[Second World War]], the general trend in the world wine market for cheap, easy-drinking wine saw a brief boom for the region. With over-cropping and an emphasis on quantity over quality, the reputation of Chianti among consumers eventually plummeted. By the 1950s, Trebbiano (which is known for its neutral flavours) made up to 30% of many mass-market Chiantis.<ref name=\"MacNeil pg 376-379\">K. MacNeil ''The Wine Bible'' pg 376-379 Workman Publishing 2001 {{ISBN|1-56305-434-5}}</ref> By the late 20th century, Chianti was often associated with basic Chianti sold in a squat bottle enclosed in a straw basket, called a ''fiasco''. However, during the same period, a group of ambitious producers began working outside the boundaries of DOC regulations to make what they believed would be a higher quality style of Chianti. These wines eventually became known as the \"[[Super Tuscans]]\".<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/>\n[[File:Italian DOCG Chianti label.jpg|left|thumb|The Italian DOCG Chianti label]]\nMany of the producers behind the Super Tuscan movement were originally Chianti producers who were rebelling against what they felt were antiquated DOC regulations. Some of these producers wanted to make Chiantis that were 100% [[varietal]] Sangiovese. Others wanted the flexibility to experiment with blending [[French (wine)|French]] grape varieties such as [[Cabernet Sauvignon]] and [[Merlot]] or to not be required to blend in any white grape varieties. The late 20th century saw a flurry of creativity and innovation in the Chianti zones as producers experimented with new grape varieties and introduced modern wine-making techniques such as the use of new [[oak barrels (wine)|oak barrels]]. The prices and [[wine ratings]] of some Super Tuscans would regularly eclipse those of DOC sanctioned Chiantis. The success of the Super Tuscans encouraged government officials to reconsider the DOC regulations in order to bring some of these wines back into the fold labelled as Chianti.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\n==Chianti subregions==\n[[File:sottozone chianti.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Chianti wine area within Tuscany]]\n\nThe Chianti region covers a vast area of Tuscany and includes within its boundaries several overlapping ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC) and ''[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita]]'' (DOCG) regions. Other well known Sangiovese-based [[Tuscan wines]] such as [[Brunello di Montalcino]] and [[Vino Nobile di Montepulciano]] could be bottled and labelled under the most basic designation of \"Chianti\" if their producers chose to do so.<ref name=\"Sotheby pg 282-286\">T.

Today, most Chianti falls under two major designations of Chianti DOCG, which includes basic level Chianti, as well as that from seven designated sub-zones, and Chianti Classico DOCG.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/> Together, these two Chianti zones produce the largest volume of DOC/G wines in Italy.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe Chianti DOCG covers all the Chianti wine and includes a large stretch of land encompassing the western reaches of the [[province of Pisa]] near the coast of the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the Florentine hills in the province of Florence to the north, to the [[province of Arezzo]] in the east and the Siena hills to the south. Within this regions are vineyards that overlap the DOCG regions of Brunello di Montalcino, Vino Nobile di Montepulciano and [[Vernaccia di San Gimignano]]. Any Sangiovese-based wine made according to the Chianti guidelines from these vineyards can be labelled and marked under the basic Chianti DOCG should the producer wish to use the designation.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nWithin the Chianti DOCG there are eight defined sub-zones that are permitted to affix their name to the [[wine label]].<ref name=\"Sotheby pg 282-286\"/>  Wines that are labelled as simply Chianti are made either from a blend from these sub-zones or include grapes from peripheral areas not within the boundaries of a sub-zone. The sub-zones are (clockwise from the north): the Colli Fiorentini which is located south of the city of Florence; Chianti Rufina in the northeastern part of the zone located around the commune of [[Rufina]]; Classico in the centre of Chianti, across the provinces of Florence and Siena; Colli Aretini in the Arezzo province to the east; Colli Senesi south of Chianti Classico in the Siena hills, which is the largest of the sub-zones and includes the Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano areas; Colline Pisane, the westernmost sub-zone in the province of Pisa; Montespertoli located within the Colli Fiorentini around the commune of [[Montespertoli]]; Montalbano in the north-west part of the zone which includes the [[Carmignano (wine)|Carmignano]] DOCG.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/> {{As of|2006}}, there were {{convert|786|acre|ha|order=flip}} under production in Montalbano, {{convert|2236|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Fiorentini, {{convert|140|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Montespertoli, {{convert|1840|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Rufina, {{convert|8780|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Senesi, {{convert|380|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in Colline Pisane, {{convert|1603|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the Colli Aretini, and an additional {{convert|25511|acre|ha|abbr=in|order=flip}} in the peripheral areas that do not fall within one of the sub-zone classifications.

The four communes of Castellina in Chianti, Gaiole in Chianti, Greve in Chianti and Radda in Chianti are located entirely within the boundaries of the Classico area with parts of Barberino Val d'Elsa, San Casciano in Val di Pesa and [[Tavarnelle Val di Pesa]] in the [[province of Florence]] as well as [[Castelnuovo Berardenga]] and [[Poggibonsi]] in the [[province of Siena]] included within the permitted boundaries of Chianti Classico. The soil and geography of this subregion can be quite varied, with altitudes ranging from {{convert|820|to|2000|ft|abbr=in|order=flip}}, and rolling hills producing differing [[macroclimate]]s. There are two main soil types in the area: a weathered sandstone known as ''[[alberese]]'' and a bluish-gray [[chalk]]y [[marlstone]] known as ''[[galestro]]''.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/> The soil in the north is richer and more fertile with more ''galestro'', with the soil gradually becoming harder and stonier with more ''albarese'' in the south. In the north, the [[Arno River]] can have an influence on the climate, keeping the temperatures slightly cooler, an influence that diminishes further south in the warmer Classico territory towards Castelnuovo Berardenga.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nChianti Classico are premium Chianti wines that tend to be medium-bodied with firm [[tannins (wine)|tannins]] and medium-high to high [[acidity (wine)|acidity]]. Floral, cherry and light nutty notes are characteristic [[aromas (wine)|aromas]] with the wines expressing more notes on the mid-[[palate]] and [[finish (wine)|finish]] than at the front of the mouth. As with [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]], the different zones of Chianti Classico have unique characteristics that can be exemplified and perceived in some wines from those areas. According to [[Master of Wine]] [[Mary Ewing-Mulligan]], Chianti Classico wines from the Castellina area tend to have a very delicate aroma and flavour, Castelnuovo Berardegna wines tend to be the [[most ripe (wine)|most ripe]] and richest tasting, wines from Gaiole tend to have been characterised by their structure and firm tannins while wines from the Greve area tend to have very concentrated flavours.<ref name=\"Dummies pg 147-159\"/>\n\nThe production of Chianti Classico is realised under the supervision of [[:it:Consorzio del Vino Chianti Classico|Consorzio del Vino Chianti Classico]], a union of producers in the Chianti Classico subregion. The Consorzio was founded with the aim of promoting the wines of the subregion, improving quality and preventing [[wine fraud]]. Since the 1980s, the foundation has sponsored extensive research into the viticultural and winemaking practice of the Chianti Classico area, particularly in the area of clonal research. In the last three decades, more than 50% of the vineyards in the Chianti Classico subregion have been replanted with improved Sangiovese clones and modern vineyard techniques as part of the Consorzio Chianti Classico's project \"Chianti 2000\".<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nIn 2014 a new category of Chianti Classico was introduced: Chianti Classico Gran Selezione.<ref name=CCGS>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chianticlassico.com/en/2014/02/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-carta-d%E2%80%99identita/|title=Chianti Classico Gran Selezione: Identity Card|work=chianticlassico.com|publisher=Consorzio Vino Chianti Classico|accessdate=January 22, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122121031/http://www.chianticlassico.com/en/2014/02/chianti-classico-gran-selezione-carta-d%E2%80%99identita/|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Gran Selezione is made exclusively from a winery\u2019s own grapes grown according to stricter regulations compared to regular Chianti Classico.<ref name=CCGS /> Gran Selezione is granted to a Chianti Classico after it passes a suitability test conducted\nby authorised laboratories and after it is approved by a special tasting committee.<ref name=CCGS />\n\n=== Greater Chianti region ===\n\n[[File:Fiaschi of basic Chianti.jpg|right|thumb|''Fiascos'' of basic Chianti that does not specify any sub-zone on the label. This wine may be a blend from several zones.]]\n\nOutside of the Chianti Classico area, the wines of the Chianti sub-zone of Rufina are among the most widely recognised and exported from the Chianti region. Located in the [[Arno]] valley near the town of [[Pontassieve]], the Rufina region includes much area in the [[Pomino]] region, an area that has a long history of wine production. The area is noted for the cool climate of its elevated vineyards located up to {{convert|2,950|ft|abbr=in|order=flip}}. The [[vineyard soil]]s of the area are predominantly [[marl]] and [[chalk]]. The Florentine merchant families of the [[Antinori]] and [[Frescobaldi]] own the majority of the vineyards in Rufina. Chianti from the Rufina area is characterised by its multi-layered [[complexity (wine)|complexity]] and elegance.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\nThe Colli Fiorentini subregion has seen an influx of activity and new vineyard development in recent years as wealthy Florentine business people move to the country to plant vineyards and open wineries. Many foreign \"[[flying winemaker]]s\" have had a hand in this development, bringing global [[viticulture]] and [[winemaking]] techniques to the Colli Fiorentini. Located in the hills between the Chianti Classico area and Arno valley, the wines of the Colli Fiorentini vary widely depending on producer, but tend to have a simple structure with strong character and fruit notes.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/> The Montespertoli sub-zone was part of the Colli Fiorentini sub-zone until 2002 when it became its own tiny enclave.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 162-163\"/>\n\nThe Montalbano subregion is located in the shadow of the Carmignano DOCG, with much of the best Sangiovese going to that wine. A similar situation exists in the Colli Senesi which includes the well known DOCG region of Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. Both regions rarely appear on wine labels that are exported out of Tuscany. The Colli Pisane area produces typical Chiantis with the lightest body and color. The Colli Aretini is a relatively new and emerging area that has seen an influx of investment and new winemaking in recent years.<ref name=\"Wine pg 402-411\"/>\n\n==Grapes and classification==\nSince 1996 the blend for Chianti and Chianti Classico has been 75\u2013100% Sangiovese, up to 10% Canaiolo and up to 20% of any other approved red grape variety such as Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot or Syrah.

Superiore is a specification for wines produced with a stricter rule of production than other Chianti wines. Chianti Superiore has been authorised since 1996.<ref>D.M. 5.08.1996</ref> Chianti Superiore wines can be produced only from grapes cultivated in the Chianti wine areas except from those vineyards that are registered in the Chianti Classico sub-zone. Vineyards registered in Chianti sub-zones other than Classico can produce Chianti Superiore wines but must omit the sub-zone name on the label. Aging is calculated from 1 January after the picking. Chianti Superiore cannot be sold to the consumer before nine months of aging, of which three must be in the bottle. Therefore, it cannot be bottled before the June after picking or sold to consumers before the next September.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=\"4\" align=center| 2004 production<ref name=\"Unione Italiana Vini\"/>\n|-\n! || Chianti Superiore || Other Chianti || % Ch.

In a reference frame with [[clockwise]] rotation, the force acts to the left of the motion of the object. In one with anticlockwise (or counterclockwise) rotation, the force acts to the right. [[Deflection (physics)|Deflection]] of an object due to the Coriolis force is called the '''Coriolis effect'''. Though recognized previously by others, the mathematical expression for the Coriolis force appeared in an 1835 paper by French scientist [[Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis]], in connection with the theory of [[water wheel]]s. Early in the 20th century, the term ''Coriolis force'' began to be used in connection with [[meteorology]].\n\n[[Newton's laws of motion]] describe the motion of an object in an [[inertial frame of reference|inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference]]. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and [[centrifugal force]] appear. Both forces are proportional to the [[mass]] of the object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to the square of the rotation rate. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, [[fictitious force]]s or ''pseudo forces''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Classical Mechanics: With introduction to Nonlinear Oscillations and Chaos|last=Bhatia|first=V.B.|publisher=Narosa Publishing House|year=1997|page=201|isbn=81-7319-105-0}}</ref> They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system. They are correction factors that do not exist in a non-accelerating or inertial reference frame.\n\nIn popular (non-technical) usage of the term \"Coriolis effect\", the rotating reference frame implied is almost always the [[Earth]]. Because the Earth spins, Earth-bound observers need to account for the Coriolis force to correctly analyze the motion of objects.  The Earth completes one rotation per day, so for motions of everyday objects the Coriolis force is usually quite small compared to other forces; its effects generally become noticeable only for motions occurring over large distances and long periods of time, such as large-scale movement of air in the atmosphere or water in the ocean. Such motions are constrained by the surface of the Earth, so only the horizontal component of the Coriolis force is generally important. This force causes moving objects on the surface of the Earth to be deflected to the right (with respect to the direction of travel) in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and to the left in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. The horizontal deflection effect is greater near the [[Geographical pole|poles]], since the effective rotation rate about a local vertical axis is largest there, and decreases to zero at the [[equator]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Coriolis Effect: Because the Earth turns \u2013 Teacher's guide|url=http://www.ametsoc.org/amsedu/proj_atm/modules/Coriolis.pdf|website=Project ATMOSPHERE|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|accessdate=10 April 2015}}</ref> Rather than flowing directly from areas of high pressure to low pressure, as they would in a non-rotating system, winds and currents tend to flow to the right of this direction north of the [[equator]] and to the left of this direction south of it. This effect is responsible for the rotation of large [[Cyclone#Structure|cyclones]] <!--Don't add tornadoes here; the Coriolis effect is not directly responsible for tornadoes-->(see [[#Meteorology|Coriolis effects in meteorology]]).\n\nFor an intuitive explanation of the origin of the Coriolis force, consider an object, constrained to follow the Earth's surface and moving northward in the northern hemisphere.  Viewed from outer space, the object does not appear to go due north, but has an eastward motion (it rotates around toward the right along with the surface of the Earth).  The further north you go, the smaller the \"horizontal diameter\" of the Earth, and so the slower the eastward motion of its surface.  As the object moves north, to higher latitudes, it has a tendency to maintain the eastward speed it started with (rather than slowing down to match the reduced eastward speed of local objects on the Earth's surface), so it veers east (i.e. to the right of its initial motion).<ref>{{cite book |title=Solar Energy at Urban Scale |first1=Benoit |last1=Beckers |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-118-61436-5 |page=116 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOnjP4k7SQC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=GAOnjP4k7SQC&pg=PT116 Extract of page 116]</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Energy and the Environment: Resources, Technologies, and Impacts |first1=Reza |last1=Toossi |publisher=Verve Publishers |year=2009 |isbn=978-1-4276-1867-2 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cb2EyrWbg0C}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-cb2EyrWbg0C&pg=PA48 Extract of page 48]</ref> Though not obvious from this example, which considers northward motion, the horizontal deflection occurs equally for objects moving east or west (or any other direction).<ref>[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-090-introduction-to-fluid-motions-sediment-transport-and-current-generated-sedimentary-structures-fall-2006/course-textbook/ch7.pdf MIT: Flow in rotating environments]</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Dechales-Coriolis-Cannon.jpg|thumb|right|Image from ''Cursus seu Mundus Mathematicus'' (1674) of C.F.M.

The formula implies that the Coriolis acceleration is perpendicular both to the direction of the velocity of the moving mass and to the frame's rotation axis. So in particular:\n* if the velocity is parallel to the rotation axis, the Coriolis acceleration is zero. (For example, on Earth, this situation occurs for a body on the equator moving north or south relative to Earth's surface.)\n* if the velocity is straight inward to the axis, the acceleration is in the direction of local rotation.

From an analytical viewpoint, to use [[Newton's second law]] in a rotating system, the Coriolis force is mathematically necessary, but it disappears in a non-accelerating, inertial frame of reference. For example, consider two children on opposite sides of a spinning roundabout ([[Merry-go-round]] ), who are throwing a ball to each other. From the children's point of view, this ball's path is curved sideways by the Coriolis force. Suppose the roundabout spins anticlockwise when viewed from above.

The same velocity (in an inertial frame of reference where the normal laws of physics apply) is seen as different velocities at different times in a rotating frame of reference. The apparent acceleration is proportional to the angular velocity of the reference frame (the rate at which the coordinate axes change direction), and to the component of velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. This gives a term <math>-\\boldsymbol\\Omega\\times\\boldsymbol v</math>. The minus sign arises from the traditional definition of the cross product ([[right-hand rule]]), and from the sign convention for angular velocity vectors.\n\nThe second is the change of velocity in space. Different positions in a rotating frame of reference have different velocities (as seen from an inertial frame of reference). For an object to move in a straight line, it must accelerate so that its velocity changes from point to point by the same amount as the velocities of the frame of reference. The force is proportional to the angular velocity (which determines the relative speed of two different points in the rotating frame of reference), and to the component of the velocity of the object in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation (which determines how quickly it moves between those points). This also gives a term <math>-\\boldsymbol\\Omega\\times\\boldsymbol v</math>.\n\n==Length scales and the Rossby number==\n{{Further|Rossby number}}\nThe time, space and velocity scales are important in determining the importance of the Coriolis force. Whether rotation is important in a system can be determined by its [[Rossby number]], which is the ratio of the velocity, ''U'', of a system to the product of the [[Coriolis parameter]],<math>f = 2 \\omega \\sin \\varphi \\,</math>, and the length scale, ''L'', of the motion:\n:<math>Ro = \\frac{U}{fL}.</math>\nThe Rossby number is the ratio of inertial to Coriolis forces. A small Rossby number indicates a system is strongly affected by Coriolis forces, and a large Rossby number indicates a system in which inertial forces dominate. For example, in tornadoes, the Rossby number is large, in low-pressure systems it is low, and in oceanic systems it is around 1. As a result, in tornadoes the Coriolis force is negligible, and balance is between pressure and centrifugal forces. In low-pressure systems, centrifugal force is negligible and balance is between Coriolis and pressure forces. In the oceans all three forces are comparable.<ref name=Lakshmi>{{Cite book|title=Numerical Models of Oceans and Oceanic Processes |author1=Lakshmi H.

However, an unguided missile obeys exactly the same physics as a baseball, but can travel far enough and be in the air long enough to experience the effect of Coriolis force. Long-range shells in the Northern Hemisphere landed close to, but to the right of, where they were aimed until this was noted. (Those fired in the Southern Hemisphere landed to the left.)

That way, by the time the cannonball reaches position 3 on the periphery, the target is also at that position.

Then, the turntable revolves an angle \u03c9 ''t<sub>f</sub>'' in this time. If the cannon is pointed an angle \u03b8 = \u03c9 ''t<sub>f</sub>'' = \u03c9 ''R'' / ''v'', then the cannonball arrives at the periphery at position number 3 at the same time as the target.\n\nNo discussion of Coriolis force can arrive at this solution as simply, so the reason to treat this problem is to demonstrate Coriolis formalism in an easily visualized situation.\n\n====Trajectory in the inertial frame====\nThe trajectory in the inertial frame (denoted ''A'') is a straight line radial path at angle \u03b8.

That direction is ''not'' toward the [[osculating circle|center of curvature]] of the path, however, which is the direction of the true centripetal force. Hence, the quotation marks on \"centripetal\".</ref>\n:<math>\\mathbf{a_{\\mathrm{Cptl}}} = -\\omega^2 \\mathbf{r_B}(t) \\ , </math>\n\nand an additional component of acceleration perpendicular to '''r'''<sub>B</sub>(''t''):\n:<math>\\mathbf{a}_{C\\perp} = 2\\omega v\\left(\\sin\\alpha, \\ -\\cos\\alpha\\right)\\ .</math>\n\nThe \"centripetal\" component of acceleration resembles that for [[circular motion]] at radius ''r''<sub>B</sub>, while the perpendicular component is velocity dependent, increasing with the radial velocity ''v'' and directed to the right of the velocity. The situation could be described as a circular motion combined with an \"apparent Coriolis acceleration\" of 2\u03c9''v''. However, this is a rough labelling: a careful designation of the true centripetal force refers to a [[Centripetal force#Local coordinates|local reference frame]] that employs the directions normal and tangential to the path, not coordinates referred to the axis of rotation.\n\nThese results also can be obtained directly by two time differentiations of '''r'''<sub>B</sub>(''t''). Agreement of the two approaches demonstrates that one could start from the general expression for fictitious acceleration above and derive the trajectories shown here. However, working from the acceleration to the trajectory is more complicated than the reverse procedure used here, which is made possible in this example by knowing the answer in advance.\n\nAs a result of this analysis an important point appears: ''all'' the fictitious accelerations must be included to obtain the correct trajectory. In particular, besides the Coriolis acceleration, the [[Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)|centrifugal force]] plays an essential role. It is easy to get the impression from verbal discussions of the cannonball problem, which focus on displaying the Coriolis effect particularly, that the Coriolis force is the only factor that must be considered,<ref name=Owen>{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Scientific Mathematics |author=George E.

''Left panel'': a ball is tossed by a thrower at 12:00 o'clock and travels in a straight line to the center of the carousel. While it travels, the thrower circles in a counter-clockwise direction. ''Right panel'': The ball's motion as seen by the thrower, who now remains at 12:00 o'clock, because there is no rotation from their viewpoint.]]\n\nThe figure illustrates a ball tossed from 12:00 o'clock toward the center of a counter-clockwise rotating carousel. On the left, the ball is seen by a stationary observer above the carousel, and the ball travels in a straight line to the center, while the ball-thrower rotates counter-clockwise with the carousel. On the right the ball is seen by an observer rotating with the carousel, so the ball-thrower appears to stay at 12:00 o'clock. The figure shows how the trajectory of the ball as seen by the rotating observer can be constructed.\n\nOn the left, two arrows locate the ball relative to the ball-thrower. One of these arrows is from the thrower to the center of the carousel (providing the ball-thrower's line of sight), and the other points from the center of the carousel to the ball. (This arrow gets shorter as the ball approaches the center.) A shifted version of the two arrows is shown dotted.\n\nOn the right is shown this same dotted pair of arrows, but now the pair are rigidly rotated so the arrow corresponding to the line of sight of the ball-thrower toward the center of the carousel is aligned with 12:00 o'clock. The other arrow of the pair locates the ball relative to the center of the carousel, providing the position of the ball as seen by the rotating observer. By following this procedure for several positions, the trajectory in the rotating frame of reference is established as shown by the curved path in the right-hand panel.\n\nThe ball travels in the air, and there is no net force upon it. To the stationary observer the ball follows a straight-line path, so there is no problem squaring this trajectory with zero net force. However, the rotating observer sees a ''curved'' path. Kinematics insists that a force (pushing to the ''right'' of the instantaneous direction of travel for a ''counter-clockwise'' rotation) must be present to cause this curvature, so the rotating observer is forced to invoke a combination of centrifugal and Coriolis forces to provide the net force required to cause the curved trajectory.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Bounced ball===\n[[File:Points of view.PNG|thumb|300px|Bird's-eye view of carousel. The carousel rotates clockwise. Two viewpoints are illustrated: that of the camera at the center of rotation rotating with the carousel (left panel) and that of the inertial (stationary) observer (right panel). Both observers agree at any given time just how far the ball is from the center of the carousel, but not on its orientation. Time intervals are 1/10 of time from launch to bounce.]]\n\nThe figure describes a more complex situation where the tossed ball on a turntable bounces off the edge of the carousel and then returns to the tosser, who catches the ball. The effect of Coriolis force on its trajectory is shown again as seen by two observers: an observer (referred to as the \"camera\") that rotates with the carousel, and an inertial observer. The figure shows a bird's-eye view based upon the same ball speed on forward and return paths. Within each circle, plotted dots show the same time points. In the left panel, from the camera's viewpoint at the center of rotation, the tosser (smiley face) and the rail both are at fixed locations, and the ball makes a very considerable arc on its travel toward the rail, and takes a more direct route on the way back. From the ball tosser's viewpoint, the ball seems to return more quickly than it went (because the tosser is rotating toward the ball on the return flight).\n\nOn the carousel, instead of tossing the ball straight at a rail to bounce back, the tosser must throw the ball toward the right of the target and the ball then seems to the camera to bear continuously to the left of its direction of travel to hit the rail (''left'' because the carousel is turning ''clockwise''). The ball appears to bear to the left from direction of travel on both inward and return trajectories. The curved path demands this observer to recognize a leftward net force on the ball. (This force is \"fictitious\" because it disappears for a stationary observer, as is discussed shortly.) For some angles of launch, a path has portions where the trajectory is approximately radial, and Coriolis force is primarily responsible for the apparent deflection of the ball (centrifugal force is radial from the center of rotation, and causes little deflection on these segments). When a path curves away from radial, however, centrifugal force contributes significantly to deflection.\n\nThe ball's path through the air is straight when viewed by observers standing on the ground (right panel). In the right panel (stationary observer), the ball tosser (smiley face) is at 12 o'clock and the rail the ball bounces from is at position one (1). From the inertial viewer's standpoint, positions one (1), two (2), three (3) are occupied in sequence. At position 2 the ball strikes the rail, and at position 3 the ball returns to the tosser. Straight-line paths are followed because the ball is in free flight, so this observer requires that no net force is applied.\n\n==Applied to the Earth==\nAn important case where the Coriolis force is observed involves the rotating Earth together with its atmosphere. The atmosphere rotates in sync with the surface of the earth due to frictional forces between the air molecules of the atmosphere (air viscosity) and the earth's surface which causes the air molecules to be carried along and move in step with the earth's surface. Unless otherwise stated, directions of forces and motion apply to the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n===Intuitive explanation===\nAs the Earth turns around its axis, everything attached to it, including the atmosphere, turns with it (imperceptibly to our senses). An object that is moving without being dragged along with the surface rotation or atmosphere such as an object in ballistic flight or an independent air mass within the atmosphere, travels in a straight motion over the turning Earth. From our rotating perspective on the planet, the direction of motion of an object in ballistic flight changes as it moves, bending in the opposite direction to our actual motion. When viewed from a stationary point in space directly above the north pole, any land feature in the Northern Hemisphere turns anticlockwise\u2014and, fixing our gaze on that location, any other location in that hemisphere rotates around it the same way. The traced [[ground path]] of a freely moving body in ballistic flight traveling from one point to another therefore bends the opposite way, clockwise, which is conventionally labeled as \"right,\" where it will be if the direction of motion is considered \"ahead,\" and \"down\" is defined naturally.\n\n===Rotating sphere===\n[[File:Earth coordinates.svg|thumb|Coordinate system at latitude \u03c6 with ''x''-axis east, ''y''-axis north and ''z''-axis upward (that is, radially outward from center of sphere).]]\n\n\nConsider a location with latitude ''\u03c6'' on a sphere that is rotating around the north-south axis.<ref name=Menke>{{Cite book|title=Geophysical Theory |author1=William Menke |author2=Dallas Abbott |pages=124\u2013126 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XP3R_pVnOoEC&pg=PA120|isbn=0-231-06792-5 |year=1990 |publisher=Columbia University Press}}</ref> A local coordinate system is set up with the ''x'' axis horizontally due east, the ''y'' axis horizontally due north and the ''z'' axis vertically upwards. The rotation vector, velocity of movement and Coriolis acceleration expressed in this local coordinate system (listing components in the order east (''e''), north (''n'') and upward (''u'')) are:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{ \\Omega} = \\omega \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ \\cos \\varphi \\\\ \\sin \\varphi \\end{pmatrix}\\ ,</math> &nbsp; &nbsp; <math>\\boldsymbol{ v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_e \\\\ v_n \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix}\\ ,</math>\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega \\times v}= 2\\,\\omega\\, \\begin{pmatrix} v_n \\sin \\varphi-v_u \\cos \\varphi \\\\ -v_e \\sin \\varphi \\\\ v_e \\cos\\varphi\\end{pmatrix}\\ .</math>\n\nWhen considering atmospheric or oceanic dynamics, the vertical velocity is small, and the vertical component of the Coriolis acceleration is small compared to gravity. For such cases, only the horizontal (east and north) components matter. The restriction of the above to the horizontal plane is (setting ''v<sub>u</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0):\n\n:<math> \\boldsymbol{ v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_e \\\\ v_n\\end{pmatrix}\\ ,</math> &nbsp; &nbsp; <math>\\boldsymbol{ a}_c = \\begin{pmatrix} v_n \\\\ -v_e\\end{pmatrix}\\ f\\ , </math>\n\nwhere <math>f = 2 \\omega \\sin \\varphi \\,</math> is called the Coriolis parameter.\n\nBy setting ''v<sub>n</sub>'' = 0, it can be seen immediately that (for positive \u03c6 and \u03c9) a movement due east results in an acceleration due south. Similarly, setting ''v<sub>e</sub>'' = 0, it is seen that a movement due north results in an acceleration due east. In general, observed horizontally, looking along the direction of the movement causing the acceleration, the acceleration always is turned 90\u00b0 to the right and of the same size regardless of the horizontal orientation.\n\nAs a different case, consider equatorial motion setting \u03c6 = 0\u00b0. In this case, '''\u03a9''' is parallel to the north or ''n''-axis, and:\n\n:<math>\\boldsymbol{ \\Omega} = \\omega \\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\\\ 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{pmatrix}\\ ,</math> &nbsp; &nbsp; <math>\\boldsymbol{ v} = \\begin{pmatrix} v_e \\\\ v_n \\\\ v_u \\end{pmatrix}\\ ,</math>&nbsp;&nbsp;<math>\\boldsymbol{ a}_C =-2\\boldsymbol{\\Omega \\times v}= 2\\,\\omega\\, \\begin{pmatrix}-v_u \\\\0 \\\\ v_e \\end{pmatrix}\\ .</math>\n\nAccordingly, an eastward motion (that is, in the same direction as the rotation of the sphere) provides an upward acceleration known as the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect]], and an upward motion produces an acceleration due west.\n\n{{Selfref|For additional examples in this article see [[#Cannon on turntable|cannon on turntable]] and [[#Tossed ball on a rotating carousel|tossed ball]].

In meteorology and [[oceanography]], it is convenient to postulate a rotating frame of reference wherein the Earth is stationary. In accommodation of that provisional postulation, the [[Centrifugal force|centrifugal]] and Coriolis forces are introduced. Their relative importance is determined by the applicable [[Coriolis effect#Length scales and the Rossby number|Rossby numbers]].

Many of the ocean's largest currents circulate around warm, high-pressure areas called [[gyre]]s. Though the circulation is not as significant as that in the air, the deflection caused by the Coriolis effect is what creates the spiraling pattern in these gyres. The spiraling wind pattern helps the hurricane form. The stronger the force from the Coriolis effect, the faster the wind spins and picks up additional energy, increasing the strength of the hurricane.<ref name=\"Coriolis effect\">{{cite web|last=Brinney|first=Amanda|title=Coriolis Effect \u2013 An Overview of the Coriolis Effect|url=http://geography.about.com/od/physicalgeography/a/coriolis.htm|publisher=About.com}}</ref>\n\nAir within high-pressure systems rotates in a direction such that the Coriolis force is directed radially inwards, and nearly balanced by the outwardly radial pressure gradient.

A system of equilibrium can then establish itself creating circular movement, or a cyclonic flow. Because the Rossby number is low, the force balance is largely between the [[pressure-gradient force]] acting towards the low-pressure area and the Coriolis force acting away from the center of the low pressure.\n\nInstead of flowing down the gradient, large scale motions in the atmosphere and ocean tend to occur perpendicular to the pressure gradient. This is known as [[geostrophic flow]].<ref name=Barry>{{cite book|title=Atmosphere, Weather and Climate |author1=Roger Graham Barry |author2=Richard J.

Note that the geostrophic balance is thus very different from the case of \"inertial motions\" (see below), which explains why mid-latitude cyclones are larger by an order of magnitude than inertial circle flow would be.\n\nThis pattern of deflection, and the direction of movement, is called [[Buys-Ballot's law]]. In the atmosphere, the pattern of flow is called a [[cyclone]]. In the Northern Hemisphere the direction of movement around a low-pressure area is anticlockwise. In the Southern Hemisphere, the direction of movement is clockwise because the rotational dynamics is a mirror image there.<ref>{{cite web | last = Nelson | first = Stephen | title = Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes) | work = Wind Systems: Low Pressure Centers | publisher = [[Tulane University]] | date = Fall 2014 | url = http://www.tulane.edu/~sanelson/New_Orleans_and_Hurricanes/tropical_cyclones.htm | accessdate = 2016-12-24 }}</ref> At high altitudes, outward-spreading air rotates in the opposite direction.<ref>[https://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA04384 Cloud Spirals and Outflow in Tropical Storm Katrina] from [[Earth Observatory]] ([[NASA]])</ref> Cyclones rarely form along the equator due to the weak Coriolis effect present in this region.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XRxzAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA326|title=Encyclopedia of Disaster Relief|last=Penuel|first=K.

Coriolis acceleration is also responsible for the propagation of many types of waves in the ocean and atmosphere, including [[Rossby wave]]s and [[Kelvin wave]]s.

This aspect of the Coriolis effect is greatest near the equator. The force produced by this effect is similar to the horizontal component, but the much larger vertical forces due to gravity and pressure mean that it is generally unimportant dynamically.\n\nIn addition, objects travelling upwards (''i.e.'', out) or downwards (''i.e.'', in) are deflected to the west or east respectively. This effect is also the greatest near the equator. Since vertical movement is usually of limited extent and duration, the size of the effect is smaller and requires precise instruments to detect. However, in the case of large changes of momentum, such as a spacecraft being launched into orbit, the effect becomes significant. The fastest and most fuel-efficient path to orbit is a launch from the equator that curves to a directly eastward heading.\n\n====Intuitive example====\n\nImagine a train that travels through a [[friction]]less railway line along the [[equator]]. Assume that, when in motion, it moves at the necessary speed to complete a trip around the world in one day (465&nbsp;m/s).<ref name=Persson>{{cite journal|last1=Persson |first1=Anders |title=The Coriolis Effect \u2013 a conflict between common sense and mathematics |page=8 |url=http://met.no/english/topics/nomek_2005/coriolis.pdf |accessdate=6 September 2015 |publisher=The Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute |location=[[Norrk\u00f6ping]], [[Sweden]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906101226/http://met.no/english/topics/nomek_2005/coriolis.pdf |archivedate=6 September 2005 }}</ref> The Coriolis effect can be considered in three cases: when the train travels west, when it is at rest, and when it travels east. In each case, the Coriolis effect can be calculated from the [[Rotating reference frame|rotating frame of reference]] on [[Earth]] first, and then checked against a fixed [[Inertial frame of reference|inertial frame]]. The image below illustrates the three cases as viewed by an observer at rest in a (near) inertial frame from a fixed point above the North Pole along the Earth's [[rotation around a fixed axis|axis of rotation]]; the train are a few red pixels, fixed at the left side in the leftmost picture, moving in the others <math>(1\\text{day}\\; \\overset{\\land}{=}\\; 8\\text{s}):</math>\n\n[[File:Earth and train 2FPS.gif|center|Earth and train]]\n\n:1. The train travels toward the west: In that case, it moves against the direction of rotation. Therefore, on the Earth's rotating frame the Coriolis term is pointed inwards towards the axis of rotation (down). This additional force downwards should cause the train to be heavier while moving in that direction.\n:*If one looks at this train from the fixed non-rotating frame on top of the center of the Earth, at that speed it remains stationary as the Earth spins beneath it. Hence, the only force acting on it is [[gravity of Earth|gravity]] and the reaction from the track. This force is greater (by 0.34%)<ref name=Persson /> than the force that the passengers and the train experience when at rest (rotating along with Earth). This difference is what the Coriolis effect accounts for in the rotating frame of reference.\n:2. The train comes to a stop: From the point of view on the Earth's rotating frame, the velocity of the train is zero, thus the Coriolis force is also zero and the train and its passengers recuperate their usual weight.\n:*From the fixed inertial frame of reference above Earth, the train now rotates along with the rest of the Earth. 0.34% of the force of gravity provides the [[centripetal force]] needed to achieve the circular motion on that frame of reference. The remaining force, as measured by a scale, makes the train and passengers \"lighter\" than in the previous case.\n:3. The train travels east. In this case, because it moves in the direction of Earth's rotating frame, the Coriolis term is directed outward from the axis of rotation (up). This upward force makes the train seem lighter still than when at rest.\n[[File:Eotvos efect on 10Kg.png|thumb|350 px|Graph of the force experienced by a 10-kilogram object as a function of its speed moving along Earth's equator (as measured within the rotating frame). (Positive force in the graph is directed upward. Positive speed is directed eastward and negative speed is directed westward).|alt=]]\n:*From the fixed inertial frame of reference above Earth, the train travelling east now rotates at twice the rate as when it was at rest\u2014so the amount of centripetal force needed to cause that circular path increases leaving less force from gravity to act on the track. This is what the Coriolis term accounts for on the previous paragraph.\n:*As a final check one can imagine a frame of reference rotating along with the train. Such frame would be rotating at twice the angular velocity as Earth's rotating frame. The resulting [[centrifugal force]] component for that imaginary frame would be greater. Since the train and its passengers are at rest, that would be the only component in that frame explaining again why the train and the passengers are lighter than in the previous two cases.\n\nThis also explains why high speed projectiles that travel west are deflected down, and those that travel east are deflected up. This vertical component of the Coriolis effect is called the [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rugai|first1=Nick|title=Computational Epistemology: From Reality To Wisdom|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=1300477237|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KUIJBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA304}}</ref>\n\nThe above example can be used to explain why the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect starts diminishing when an object is travelling westward as its [[tangential speed]] increases above Earth's rotation (465&nbsp;m/s). If the westward train in the above example increases speed, part of the force of gravity that pushes against the track accounts for the centripetal force needed to keep it in circular motion on the inertial frame. Once the train doubles its westward speed at 930&nbsp;m/s that centripetal force becomes equal to the force the train experiences when it stops. From the inertial frame, in both cases it rotates at the same speed but in the opposite directions. Thus, the force is the same cancelling completely the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect. Any object that moves westward at a speed above 930&nbsp;m/s experiences an upward force instead. In the figure<!--NOW THE FIGURE IS WRONG - PLEASE CORRECT THE GRAPH AND REMOVE THIS COMMENT-->, the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect is illustrated for a 10 kilogram object on the train at different speeds. The parabolic shape is because the [[centripetal force]] is proportional to the square of the tangential speed. On the inertial frame, the bottom of the parabola is centered at the origin. The offset is because this argument uses the Earth's rotating frame of reference. The graph shows that the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect is not symmetrical, and that the resulting downward force experienced by an object that travels west at high velocity is less than the resulting upward force when it travels east at the same speed.\n\n===Draining in bathtubs and toilets===\nContrary to popular misconception, water rotation in home bathrooms under ''normal'' circumstances is not related to the Coriolis effect or to the rotation of the Earth, and no consistent difference in rotation direction between toilet drainage in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres can be observed.<ref>{{cite web | title = Bad Coriolis | url = http://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadCoriolis.html | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Flush Bosh | url = http://www.snopes.com/science/coriolis.asp | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Does the rotation of the Earth affect toilets and baseball games? | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/rotation-earth-toilet-baseball2.htm | accessdate = 2016-12-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Can somebody finally settle this question: Does water flowing down a drain spin in different directions depending on which hemisphere you're in?

Any rotation around the plug hole that is initially present accelerates as water moves inward.\n\nThe Coriolis force still affects the direction of the flow of water, but only minutely. Only if the water is so still that the effective rotation rate of the Earth is faster than that of the water relative to its container, and if externally applied torques (such as might be caused by flow over an uneven bottom surface) are small enough, the Coriolis effect may indeed determine the direction of the vortex. Without such careful preparation, the Coriolis effect is likely to be much smaller than various other influences on drain direction<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hOLs-bmiYYC&pg=PA168|pages=168\u20139|title=Physics: A World View|author1=Larry D.

The drain plug was then very slowly removed, and tiny pieces of floating wood were used to observe rotation. During the first 12 to 15 minutes, no rotation was observed. Then, a vortex appeared and consistently began to rotate in an anticlockwise direction (the experiment was performed in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], in the Northern Hemisphere). This was repeated and the results averaged to make sure the effect was real. The report noted that the vortex rotated, \"about 30,000 times faster than the effective rotation of the Earth in 42\u00b0 North (the experiment's location)\". This shows that the small initial rotation due to the Earth is amplified by gravitational draining and conservation of angular momentum to become a rapid vortex and may be observed under carefully controlled [[laboratory]] conditions.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/1961080b0|title=Bath-Tub Vortex|year=1962|last1=Shapiro|first1=Ascher H.|journal=Nature|volume=196|pages=1080\u20131081|bibcode=1962Natur.196.1080S|issue=4859}}</ref><ref>[http://web.mit.edu/fluids/www/Shapiro/ncfmf.html (Vorticity, Part 1)].

The Coriolis force minutely changes the trajectory of a bullet, affecting accuracy at extremely long distances. It is adjusted for by accurate long-distance shooters, such as snipers. At the latitude of [[Sacramento]] a 1000 yard shot would be deflected 3 inches to the right. There is also a vertical component, explained in the E\u00f6tv\u00f6s effect section above, which causes westward shots to hit low, and eastward shots to hit high.<ref name=Taylor0 /><ref>{{cite news |title=Do Snipers Compensate for the Earth\u2019s Rotation? |url=https://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/columns/straight-dope/article/13039128/do-snipers-compensate-for-the-earthrsquos-rotation-what-the-coriolis |accessdate=16 July 2018 |work=Washington City Paper |date=25 June 2010 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of the Coriolis force on ballistic trajectories should not be confused with the curvature of the paths of missiles, satellites, and similar objects when the paths are plotted on two-dimensional (flat) maps, such as the [[Mercator projection]]. The projections of the three-dimensional curved surface of the Earth to a two-dimensional surface (the map) necessarily results in distorted features. The apparent curvature of the path is a consequence of the sphericity of the Earth and would occur even in a non-rotating frame.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Visualization of the Coriolis effect==\n[[File:Parabola shape in rotating layers of fluid.jpg|thumb|right|Fluid assuming a parabolic shape as it is rotating]]\n[[File:Parabolic dish ellipse oscill.gif|frame|right|Object moving frictionlessly over the surface of a very shallow parabolic dish.

However, if the turntable surface has the correct [[paraboloid]] (parabolic bowl) shape (see the figure) and rotates at the corresponding rate, the force components shown in the figure make the component of gravity tangential to the bowl surface exactly equal to the centripetal force necessary to keep the object rotating at its velocity and radius of curvature (assuming no friction). (See [[Centripetal force#Example: The banked turn|banked turn]].) This carefully contoured surface allows the Coriolis force to be displayed in isolation.<ref name=parabola>When a container of fluid is rotating on a turntable, the surface of the fluid naturally assumes the correct [[parabola|parabolic]] shape. This fact may be exploited to make a parabolic turntable by using a fluid that sets after several hours, such as a synthetic [[resin]]. For a video of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb/lab5/gfd_v.htm Geophysical fluid dynamics lab demonstration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120121513/http://www-paoc.mit.edu/labweb/lab5/gfd_v.htm |date=20 November 2005 }} John Marshall, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</ref><ref name=animation>For a java applet of the Coriolis effect on such a parabolic surface, see [http://mensch.org/physlets/inosc.html Brian Fiedler] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321094211/http://www.mensch.org/physlets/inosc.html |date=21 March 2006 }} School of Meteorology at the University of Oklahoma.</ref>\n\nDiscs cut from cylinders of [[dry ice]] can be used as pucks, moving around almost frictionlessly over the surface of the parabolic turntable, allowing effects of Coriolis on dynamic phenomena to show themselves. To get a view of the motions as seen from the reference frame rotating with the turntable, a video camera is attached to the turntable so as to co-rotate with the turntable, with results as shown in the figure. In the left panel of the figure, which is the viewpoint of a stationary observer, the gravitational force in the inertial frame pulling the object toward the center (bottom ) of the dish is proportional to the distance of the object from the center. A centripetal force of this form causes the elliptical motion. In the right panel, which shows the viewpoint of the rotating frame, the inward gravitational force in the rotating frame (the same force as in the inertial frame) is balanced by the outward centrifugal force (present only in the rotating frame). With these two forces balanced, in the rotating frame the only unbalanced force is Coriolis (also present only in the rotating frame), and the motion is an ''[[#Inertial circles|inertial circle]]''. Analysis and observation of circular motion in the rotating frame is a simplification compared to analysis or observation of elliptical motion in the inertial frame.\n\nBecause this reference frame rotates several times a minute rather than only once a day like the Earth, the Coriolis acceleration produced is many times larger and so easier to observe on small time and spatial scales than is the Coriolis acceleration caused by the rotation of the Earth.\n\nIn a manner of speaking, the Earth is analogous to such a turntable.<ref name=Marshall>{{cite book|title=Atmosphere, Ocean, and Climate Dynamics: An Introductory Text|author1=John Marshall |author2=R.

(See [[equatorial bulge]].)\n\nThe Coriolis effect caused by the rotation of the Earth can be seen indirectly through the motion of a [[Foucault pendulum]].\n{{clear}}\n\n==Coriolis effects in other areas==\n\n===Coriolis flow meter===\nA practical application of the Coriolis effect is the [[mass flow meter]], an instrument that measures the [[mass flow rate]] and [[density]] of a fluid flowing through a tube. The operating principle involves inducing a vibration of the tube through which the fluid passes. The vibration, though not completely circular, provides the rotating reference frame that gives rise to the Coriolis effect. While specific methods vary according to the design of the flow meter, sensors monitor and analyze changes in frequency, phase shift, and amplitude of the vibrating flow tubes. The changes observed represent the mass flow rate and density of the fluid.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Omega Engineering|url=http://www.omega.com/literature/transactions/volume4/t9904-10-mass.html|title=Mass Flowmeters}}</ref>\n\n===Molecular physics===\nIn polyatomic molecules, the molecule motion can be described by a rigid body rotation and internal vibration of atoms about their equilibrium position. As a result of the vibrations of the atoms, the atoms are in motion relative to the rotating coordinate system of the molecule. Coriolis effects are therefore present, and make the atoms move in a direction perpendicular to the original oscillations. This leads to a mixing in molecular spectra between the rotational and vibrational [[energy level|levels]], from which Coriolis coupling constants can be determined.<ref>{{cite book |last1=califano |first1=S |title=Vibrational states |year=1976|publisher=Wiley |isbn=0471129968|pages=226\u2013227}}</ref>\n\n===Gyroscopic precession===\n\nWhen an external torque is applied to a spinning gyroscope along an axis that is at right angles to the spin axis, the rim velocity that is associated with the spin becomes radially directed in relation to the external torque axis. This causes a Coriolis force to act on the rim in such a way as to tilt the gyroscope at right angles to the direction that the external torque would have tilted it. This tendency has the effect of keeping spinning bodies stably aligned in space.\n\n=== Insect flight ===\nFlies ([[Diptera]]) and some moths ([[Lepidoptera]]) exploit the Coriolis effect in flight with specialized appendages and organs that relay information about the [[angular velocity]] of their bodies.\n\nCoriolis forces resulting from linear motion of these appendages are detected within the rotating frame of reference of the insects' bodies.

This study by James. V.

Taking uncertainties in depth measurements and position estimation into account the raw data of the 2010 bathymetry of the Challenger Deep vicinity consisting of 2,051,371 soundings from eight survey lines was analyzed. The study concludes that with the best of 2010 multibeam echosounder technologies after the analysis a depth uncertainty of \u00b1{{convert|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (95% confidence level) on 9 degrees of freedom and a positional uncertainty of \u00b1{{convert|20|to|25|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (2drms) remain and the location of the deepest depth recorded in the 2010 mapping is {{convert|10984|m|ft|abbr=on}} at {{Coord|11.329903|N|142.199305|E|scale:100000}}. The depth measurement uncertainty is a composite of measured uncertainties in the spatial variations in sound-speed through the water volume, the ray-tracing and bottom-detection algorithms of the multibeam system, the accuracies and calibration of the motion sensor and navigation systems, estimates of spherical spreading, attenuation throughout the water volume, and so forth.<ref name=\"So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench?\">{{cite web|url=http://ccom.unh.edu/sites/default/files/publications/Gardner-et-al-2014-Challenger-Deep.pdf |title=So, How Deep Is the Mariana Trench? |date=5 March 2014 |publisher=Center for Coastal & Ocean Mapping-Joint Hydrographic Center (CCOM/JHC), Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory of the University of New Hampshire |accessdate=20 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe 2009 and 2010 maximal depths were not confirmed by the series of dives ''Nereus'' made to the bottom during an expedition in May\u2013June 2009.

Over the course of six to nine million years, as the Challenger Deep grew to its present depth, many of the species present in the sediment died out or were unable to adapt to the increasing water pressure and changing environment.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roach|first1=John|title=Life If Found Thriving at Ocean's Deepest Point|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/02/0203_050203_deepest.html|website=National Geographic|publisher=National Geographic Society|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> The species that survived the change in depth were the ancestors of the Challenger Deep's current denizens.{{citation needed|date = January 2012}}\n\nOn 17 March 2013, researchers reported data that suggested [[microbes|microbial life forms]] thrive in the Challenger Deep.<ref name=\"LS-20130317\">{{cite web |last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=Microbes Thrive in Deepest Spot on Earth |url=http://www.livescience.com/27954-microbes-mariana-trench.html |date=17 March 2013 |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"NG-20130317\">{{cite journal |last1=Glud |first1=Ronnie |last2=Wenzh\u00f6fer |first2=Frank |last3=Middleboe |first3=Mathias |last4=Oguri |first4=Kazumasa |last5=Turnewitsch |first5=Robert |last6=Canfield |first6=Donald E. |last7=Kitazato |first7=Hiroshi |title=High rates of microbial carbon turnover in sediments in the deepest oceanic trench on Earth |url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo1773.html |doi=10.1038/ngeo1773 |date=17 March 2013 |journal=[[Nature Geoscience]] |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=284 |accessdate=17 March 2013 |bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..284G }}</ref> Other researchers reported related studies that microbes thrive inside rocks up to {{convert|1900|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} below the sea floor under {{convert|8500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} of ocean off the coast of the northwestern United States.<ref name=\"LS-20130317\" /><ref name=\"LS-20130314\">{{cite web |last=Oskin |first=Becky |title=Intraterrestrials: Life Thrives in Ocean Floor |url=http://www.livescience.com/27899-ocean-subsurface-ecosystem-found.html |date=14 March 2013 |publisher=[[LiveScience]] |accessdate=17 March 2013 }}</ref> According to one of the researchers, \"You can find microbes everywhere{{spnd}}they're extremely adaptable to conditions, and survive wherever they are.\"<ref name=\"LS-20130317\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[HMRG Deep|Sirena Deep]]\n* [[Horizon Deep]]\n* [[Galathea Depth]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/vessels/submersibles11.htm |title=Official press release regarding Challenger Deep operation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020418105908/http://www.onr.navy.mil/focus/ocean/vessels/submersibles11.htm|archivedate=18 April 2002}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090403201531/http://www.marianatrench.com/default.htm Mariana Trench]\n* [http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2016/mar/mariana-trench-seven-miles-deep-ocean-still-noisy-place Mariana Trench: Seven miles deep, the ocean is still a noisy place]\n* [http://deepseamap.com/#?l=11.1682,142.8059,9,oceans,0,9 Location of Challenger Deep] Interactive map\n\n{{Coord|11|22.4|N|142|35.5|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Extreme points of Earth]]\n[[Category:Geology of the Pacific Ocean]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Oceania]]", "sha1": "5pinwjl9fp2pbonrb4daq3ryywy0hrw"}}, {"title": "Claude Louis Berthollet", "ns": "0", "id": "7787", "revision": {"id": "858731438", "parentid": "819865056", "timestamp": "2018-09-09T06:46:23Z", "contributor": {"username": "Hmains", "id": "508734"}, "minor": "", "comment": "standard quote handling in WP;standard Apostrophe/quotation marks in WP;

On a practical basis, Berthollet was the first to demonstrate the bleaching action of chlorine gas, and was first to develop a solution of [[sodium hypochlorite]] as a modern bleaching agent.\n\n==Biography==\nClaude Louis Berthollet was born in  [[Talloires]], near [[Annecy]], then part of the [[Duchy of Savoy]], in 1749.\n\nHe started his studies at Chamb\u00e9ry and then in Turin where he graduated in medicine. Berthollet's great new developments in works regarding chemistry made him, in a short period of time, an active participant of the Academy of Science in 1780.\n\nBerthollet, along with [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and others, devised a chemical nomenclature, or a system of names, which serves as the basis of the modern system of naming chemical compounds.\n\nHe also carried out research into [[dye]]s and [[Bleach (chemical)|bleach]]es, being first to introduce the use of [[chlorine]] gas as a commercial bleach in 1785. He first produced a modern bleaching liquid in 1789 in his laboratory on the quay [[Javel - Andr\u00e9 Citro\u00ebn (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Javel]] in [[Paris]], France, by passing [[chlorine]] gas through a solution of sodium carbonate. The resulting liquid, known as \"''Eau de Javel''\" (\"Javel water\"), was a weak solution of sodium hypochlorite. Another strong chlorine oxidant and bleach which he investigated and was the first to produce, [[potassium chlorate]] (KClO<sub>3</sub>), is known as ''Berthollet's Salt''.\n\nBerthollet first determined the elemental composition of the gas [[ammonia]], in 1785.\n\nBerthollet was one of the first chemists to recognize the characteristics of a [[Reversible reaction|reverse reaction]], and hence, [[chemical equilibrium]].\n\nBerthollet was engaged in a long-term battle with another French chemist, [[Joseph Proust]], on the validity of the [[law of definite proportions]]. While Proust believed that chemical compounds are composed of a fixed ratio of their constituent elements irrespective of the methods of production, Berthollet believed that this ratio can change according to the ratio of the reactants initially taken. Although Proust proved his theory by accurate measurements, his theory was not immediately accepted partially due to Berthollet's authority. His law was finally accepted when [[Berzelius]] confirmed it in 1811. But it was found later that Berthollet was not completely wrong because there exists a class of compounds that do not obey the law of definite proportions. These [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s are also named ''berthollides'' in his honor.\n\nBerthollet was one of several scientists who went with [[Napoleon]] to Egypt, and was a member of the physics and natural history section of the [[Institut d'\u00c9gypte]].\n\n==Awards and honours==\nIn April, 1789 Berthollet was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] of London.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27berthollet%27%29 | title = Library and Archive Catalogue | publisher= Royal Society| accessdate=13 December 2010}}</ref> In 1801, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

Brighter atoms are [[strontium]] and darker ones are titanium.]]\n\n'''Crystallography''' is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids (see [[crystal structure]]). The word \"crystallography\" derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''crystallon'' \"cold drop, frozen drop\", with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and ''graphein'' \"to write\".  In July 2012, the [[United Nations]] recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography.<ref name=\"UN Resolution\">[http://www.iycr2014.org/about/resolution UN announcement \"International Year of Crystallography\"]. iycr2014.org. 12 July 2012</ref> [[X-ray crystallography]] is used to determine the structure of large [[biomolecule]]s such as [[protein]]s. \nBefore the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of [[crystal]]s was based on physical measurements of their geometry. This involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes (crystallographic axes), and establishing the [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] of the crystal in question. This physical measurement is carried out using a [[goniometer]]. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a [[Wulff net]] or [[Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection|Lambert net]]. The [[pole figure|pole]] to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its [[Miller index]]. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established.\n\nCrystallographic methods now depend on analysis of the [[diffraction]] patterns of a sample targeted by a beam of some type. [[X-ray]]s are most commonly used; other beams used include [[electron]]s or [[neutron]]s. This is facilitated by the wave properties of the particles. Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of beam used, as in the terms ''[[X-ray crystallography]], [[neutron diffraction]]'' and ''[[electron diffraction]]''. These three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways. \n*X-rays interact with the spatial distribution of [[electron]]s in the sample. \n*Electrons are [[charged particle]]s and therefore interact with the total [[Charge density|charge distribution]] of both the [[atomic nuclei]] and the electrons of the sample. \n*Neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the [[strong nuclear force]]s, but in addition, the [[magnetic moment]] of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by [[magnetic field]]s. When neutrons are scattered from [[hydrogen]]-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material can sometimes be treated to substitute [[deuterium]] for hydrogen. \nBecause of these different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies.\n\n==Theory==\n{{Condensed matter physics}}\nAn image of a small object is made using a [[lens (optics)|lens]] to focus the beam, similar to a lens in a microscope. However, the wavelength of visible light (about 4000 to 7000 [[\u00e5ngstr\u00f6m]]) is three [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]] longer than the length of typical [[chemical bond|atomic bonds]] and [[atom]]s themselves (about 1 to 2&nbsp;\u00c5). Therefore, obtaining information about the spatial arrangement of atoms requires the use of radiation with shorter wavelengths, such as X-ray or neutron beams. Employing shorter wavelengths implied abandoning microscopy and true imaging, however, because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Scientists have had some success focusing X-rays with microscopic [[Fresnel zone plate]]s made from gold, and by critical-angle reflection inside long tapered capillaries.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Synchrotron Radiation|volume=14|year=2007|pages=326\u2013330|doi=10.1107/S0909049507025174|title=Two-step hard X-ray focusing combining Fresnel zone plate and single-bounce ellipsoidal capillary|author=Snigirev, A. |pmid=17587657|issue=Pt 4}}</ref> Diffracted X-ray or neutron beams cannot be focused to produce images, so the sample structure must be reconstructed from the diffraction pattern. Sharp features in the diffraction pattern arise from periodic, repeating structure in the sample, which are often very strong due to coherent reflection of many photons from many regularly spaced instances of similar structure, while non-periodic components of the structure result in diffuse (and usually weak) diffraction features - areas with a higher density and repetition of atom order tend to reflect more light toward one point in space when compared to those areas with fewer atoms and less repetition.\n\nBecause of their highly ordered and repetitive structure, crystals give diffraction patterns of sharp [[Bragg reflection]] spots, and are ideal for analyzing the structure of solids.\n\n==Notation==<!-- This section is linked from [[Ion implantation]] -->\n{{Main|Miller index}}\n\n*Coordinates in ''square [[bracket]]s'' such as '''<nowiki>[100]</nowiki>''' denote a direction vector (in real space).\n*Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' or ''chevrons'' such as '''&lt;100&gt;''' denote a ''family'' of directions which are related by symmetry operations. In the cubic [[crystal system]] for example, '''<100>''' would mean <nowiki>[100], [010], [001]</nowiki> or the negative of any of those directions.\n*Miller indices in ''parentheses'' such as '''(100)''' denote a plane of the crystal structure, and regular repetitions of that plane with a particular spacing. In the cubic system, the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to the (hkl) plane is the direction [hkl], but in lower-symmetry cases, the normal to (hkl) is not parallel to [hkl].\n*Indices in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as '''<nowiki>{100}</nowiki>''' denote a family of planes and their normals which are equivalent in cubic materials due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions. In non-cubic materials, <hkl> is not necessarily perpendicular to {hkl}.\n\n==Techniques==\nSome materials that have been analyzed crystallographically, such as [[protein]]s, do not occur naturally as crystals. Typically, such molecules are placed in solution and allowed to slowly crystallize through vapor [[diffusion]]. A drop of solution containing the molecule, buffer, and precipitants is sealed in a container with a reservoir containing a [[hygroscopic]] solution. Water in the drop diffuses to the reservoir, slowly increasing the concentration and allowing a crystal to form. If the concentration were to rise more quickly, the molecule would simply [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] out of solution, resulting in disorderly granules rather than an orderly and hence usable crystal.\n\nOnce a crystal is obtained, data can be collected using a beam of radiation. Although many universities that engage in crystallographic research have their own X-ray producing equipment, [[Synchrotron light|synchrotron]]s are often used as X-ray sources, because of the purer and more complete patterns such sources can generate. Synchrotron sources also have a much higher intensity of X-ray beams, so data collection takes a fraction of the time normally necessary at weaker sources. Complementary neutron crystallography techniques are used to identify the positions of hydrogen atoms, since X-rays only interact very weakly with light elements such as hydrogen.\n\nProducing an image from a diffraction pattern requires sophisticated [[mathematics]] and often an iterative process of '''modelling and refinement.''' In this process, the mathematically predicted diffraction patterns of an hypothesized or \"model\" structure are compared to the actual pattern generated by the crystalline sample. Ideally, researchers make several initial guesses, which through refinement all converge on the same answer. Models are refined until their predicted patterns match to as great a degree as can be achieved without radical revision of the model. This is a painstaking process, made much easier today by computers.\n\nThe mathematical methods for the analysis of diffraction data only apply to ''patterns,'' which in turn result only when waves diffract from orderly arrays. Hence crystallography applies for the most part only to crystals, or to molecules which can be coaxed to crystallize for the sake of measurement. In spite of this, a certain amount of molecular information can be deduced from patterns that are generated by fibers and [[powder diffraction|powders]], which while not as perfect as a solid crystal, may exhibit a degree of order. This level of order can be sufficient to deduce the structure of simple molecules, or to determine the coarse features of more complicated molecules. For example, the double-helical structure of [[DNA]] was deduced from an X-ray diffraction pattern that had been generated by a fibrous sample.\n\n==In materials science==\nCrystallography is used by materials scientists to characterize different materials. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. In addition, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding [[crystallographic defect]]s. Mostly, materials do not occur as a single crystal, but in poly-crystalline form (i.e., as an aggregate of small crystals with different orientations). Because of this, the [[powder diffraction]] method, which takes diffraction patterns of polycrystalline samples with a large number of crystals, plays an important role in structural determination.\n\nOther physical properties are also linked to crystallography. For example, the minerals in [[clay]] form small, flat, platelike structures. Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates, yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates. Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic [[Texture (crystalline)|texture]] measurements.\n\nIn another example, [[iron]] transforms from a [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) structure to a [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) structure called [[austenite]] when it is heated. The fcc structure is a close-packed structure unlike the bcc structure; thus the volume of the iron decreases when this transformation occurs.\n\nCrystallography is useful in phase identification. When manufacturing or using a material, it is generally desirable to know what compounds and what phases are present in the material, as their composition, structure and proportions will influence the material's properties. Each phase has a characteristic arrangement of atoms. X-ray or neutron diffraction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material, and thus which compounds are present. Crystallography covers the enumeration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason is related to group theory and geometry.\n\n==Biology==\n[[X-ray crystallography]] is the primary method for determining the molecular conformations of biological [[macromolecule]]s, particularly [[protein]] and [[nucleic acid]]s such as [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. In fact, the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from crystallographic data. The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958, a three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by X-ray analysis.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/181662a0| title = A Three-Dimensional Model of the Myoglobin Molecule Obtained by X-Ray Analysis| journal = Nature| volume = 181| issue = 4610| pages = 662\u20136| year = 1958| last1 = Kendrew | first1 = J.

Computer programs such as [[RasMol]] or [[Pymol]] can be used to visualize biological molecular structures.\n[[Neutron crystallography]] is often used to help refine structures obtained by X-ray methods or to solve a specific bond; the methods are often viewed as complementary, as X-rays are sensitive to electron positions and scatter most strongly off heavy atoms, while neutrons are sensitive to nucleus positions and scatter strongly even off many light isotopes, including hydrogen and deuterium.\n[[Electron crystallography]] has been used to determine some protein structures, most notably [[membrane protein]]s and [[viral capsid]]s.\n\n== Reference literature in crystallography ==\nThe ''International Tables for Crystallography''<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Tables for Crystallography Vol. C: Mathematical, Physical and Chemical Tables|last=Prince|first=E.|publisher=Wiley|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4020-4969-9|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> is an eight book series that outlines the standard notations for formatting, describing and testing crystals.

This large Royal Air Force station was west of Baghdad in [[Iraq]] and General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Archibald Wavell]], Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]], was reluctant to intervene, despite the urgings of [[Winston Churchill]], because of his pressing commitments in the Western Desert and Greece. Auchinleck, however, acted decisively, sending a battalion of the [[King's Own Royal Regiment]] by air to Habbaniya and shipping the [[Indian 10th Infantry Division]] by sea to [[Basra]]. Wavell was prevailed upon by London to send ''[[Habforce]]'', a relief column, from the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] but by the time it arrived in Habbaniya on 18 May the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] was virtually over.<ref name=\"Mead53\">Mead, p.53</ref>\n\n===North Africa July 1941 \u2013 August 1942===\nFollowing the see-saw of Allied and Axis successes and reverses in North Africa, Auchinleck was appointed to succeed General [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|Sir Archibald Wavell]] as C-in-C [[Middle East Command]] in July 1941;<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35218| date=11 July 1941|page=4048| supp=y}}</ref> Wavell took up Auchinleck's post as C-in-C of the Indian Army, swapping jobs with him.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35247|date=15 August 1941|page=4740}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The British Army in the Middle East 1941 E5450.jpg|thumb|left|General Sir Archibald Wavell, C-in-C India and General Sir Claude Auchinleck, C-in-C Middle East, 8 September 1941.]]\n\nAs Commander-in-Chief Middle East Auchinleck, based in [[Cairo]], held responsibility not just for North Africa but also for [[Iran|Persia]] and the Middle East. He launched an offensive in the [[Western Desert Campaign|Western Desert]], [[Operation Crusader]], in November 1941: despite some tactical reverses during the fighting which resulted in Auchinleck replacing the Eighth Army commander [[Alan Cunningham]] with [[Neil Ritchie]], by the end of December [[70th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|the besieged garrison]] of [[Tobruk]] had been relieved and Rommel obliged to withdraw to El Agheila. Auchinleck appears to have believed that enemy had been defeated, writing on 12 January 1942 that the Axis forces were \"beginning to feel the strain\" and were \"hard pressed\".<ref name=\"Stewart46\">Stewart, p. 46</ref> In fact the Axis forces had managed to withdraw in good order and a few days after Auchinleck's optimistic appreciation, having reorganised and been reinforced, struck at the dispersed and weakened British forces, driving them back to the Gazala positions near [[Tobruk]].<ref name=heath32>Heathcote, p. 32</ref> The British Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]], wrote in his diary that it was \"nothing less than bad generalship on the part of Auchinleck. He has been overconfident and has believed everything his overoptimistic [DMI] Shearer has told him\". Brooke commented that Auchinleck \"could have been one of the finest of commanders\" but lacked the ability to select the men to serve him. Brooke sent him one of his best armoured division commanders [[Richard McCreery]], whose advice was ignored in favour of Dorman-Smith's.<ref name=\"AB19420130\">Alanbrooke Diaries, 30 January 1942</ref>\n\n[[File:British Generals 1939-1945 E8454.jpg|thumb|right|Major-General [[Jock Campbell (British Army officer)|John \"Jock\" Campbell]] and General Sir Claude Auchinleck, C-in-C Middle East, in the Western Desert.]]\n\n[[Rommel]]'s attack at the [[Battle of Gazala]] of 26 May 1942 resulted in a significant defeat for the British. Auchinleck's appreciation of the situation written to Ritchie on 20 May had suggested that the armoured reserves be concentrated in a position suitable to meet both a flanking attack around the south of the front or a direct attack through the centre (which was the likelihood more favoured by Auchinleck).<ref>Warner (1982), pp.181 & 182</ref> In the event, Ritchie chose a more dispersed and rearward positioning of his two armoured divisions<ref>Warner (1982), p. 182</ref> and when the attack in the centre came, it proved to be a diversion and the main attack, by Rommel's armoured formations, came round the southern flank. Poor initial positioning and subsequent handling and coordination of Allied formations by Ritchie and his corps commanders resulted in their heavy defeat and the Eighth Army retreating into [[Egypt]]; [[Tobruk]] fell to the Axis on 21 June 1942.<ref>Playfair, pp. 261\u2013275</ref>\n\nOn 24 June Auchinleck stepped in to take direct command of the Eighth Army, having lost confidence in [[Neil Ritchie]]'s ability to control and direct his forces. Auchinleck discarded Ritchie's plan to stand at [[Mersa Matruh]], deciding to fight only a delaying action there, while withdrawing to the more easily defendable position at [[El Alamein]]. Here Auchinleck tailored a defence that took advantage of the terrain and the fresh troops at his disposal, stopping the exhausted German/Italian advance in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. Enjoying a considerable superiority of material and men over the weak German/Italian forces, Auchinleck organised a series of counter-attacks. Poorly conceived and badly coordinated, these attacks achieved little.<ref name=\"Barr83-184\">Barr, pp.83\u2013184</ref>\n\n\"The Auk\", as he was known, appointed a number of senior commanders who proved to be unsuitable for their positions, and command arrangements were often characterised by bitter personality clashes. Auchinleck was an Indian Army officer and was criticised for apparently having little direct experience or understanding of British and Dominion troops. His controversial chief of operations, Major-General [[Eric Dorman-Smith|Dorman-Smith]], was regarded with considerable distrust by many of the senior commanders in Eighth Army. By July 1942 Auchinleck had lost the confidence of Dominion commanders and relations with his British commanders had become strained.{{#tag:ref|Alanbrooke in a footnote to his diary entry of 30 January wrote: \"Auchinleck, to my mind, had most of the qualifications to make him one of the finest of commanders, but unfortunately he lacked the most important of all \u2013 the ability to select the men to serve him. The selection of [[Thomas Corbett (Indian Army officer)|Corbett]] as his Chief of Staff, [[Eric Dorman-Smith|Dorman-Smith]] as his chief advisor, and (Eric) Shearer as his head of intelligence service contributed most of all to his downfall\"<ref name=\"AB19420130\"/>|group=note}}\n\nLike his foe Rommel (and his predecessor Wavell and successor Montgomery), Auchinleck was subjected to constant political interference, having to weather a barrage of hectoring telegrams and instructions from Prime Minister Churchill throughout late 1941 and the spring and summer of 1942. Churchill constantly sought an offensive from Auchinleck, and was downcast at the military reverses in Egypt and Cyrenaica. Churchill was desperate for some sort of British victory before the planned Allied landings in North Africa, [[Operation Torch]], scheduled for November 1942. He badgered Auchinleck immediately after the Eighth Army had all but exhausted itself after the first battle of El Alamein. Churchill and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, [[Alan Brooke]], flew to Cairo in early August 1942, to meet Auchinleck, where it emerged he had lost the confidence of both men.<ref>Alanbrooke (2001), p. 297</ref> He was replaced as Commander-in-Chief [[Middle East Command]] by General [[Harold Alexander|Sir Harold Alexander]] (later Field Marshal Earl Alexander of Tunis).<ref name=heath33>Heathcote, p. 33</ref>\n\nJoseph M. Horodyski and Maurice Remy both praise Auchinleck as an underrated military leader who contributed the most to the successful defence of El Alamein and consequently the final defeat of Rommel in Africa. The two historians also criticize Churchill for the unreasonable decision to put the blame on Auchinleck and to relieve him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Horodyski|first1=Joseph M.|title=Sir Claude Auchinleck: Overshadowed Equal to Erwin Rommel|date=23 September 2016|publisher=2016 Sovereign Media|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/sir-claude-auchinleck-overshadowed-equal-to-erwin-rommel/|accessdate=27 September 2016}}</ref>{{sfn|Remy|2002|p=107}}\n\n===India 1942\u20131945===\n[[File:AuchinleckNepal.jpg|thumb|Auchinleck receiving the [[Star of Nepal]] in October 1945 from the King of Nepal, Tribhubana Bir Vikram Sah]]Churchill offered Auchinleck command of the newly created [[Persia and Iraq Command]] (this having been separated from Alexander's command), but Auchinleck declined this post, as he believed that separating the area from the Middle East Command was not good policy and the new arrangements would not be workable.

Peirse and Auchinleck had been students together at the Imperial Defence College, but that was long before. Peirse was now Allied Air Commander-in-Chief, South-East Asia, and also based in India. The affair became known to Mountbatten in early 1944, and he passed the information to the Chief of the RAF, [[Charles Portal, 1st Viscount Portal of Hungerford|Sir Charles Portal]], hoping that Peirse would be recalled. The affair was common knowledge by September 1944, and Peirse was neglecting his duties. Mountbatten sent Peirse and Lady Auchinleck back to England on 28 November 1944,<ref>Bond, p. 124</ref> where they lived together at a Brighton hotel. Peirse had his marriage dissolved, and Auchinleck obtained a divorce in 1946.<ref name=heath34>Heathcote, p. 34</ref> Auchinleck was reportedly very badly affected.

While Camilla Hall attended elementary school in Minnesota, the family moved to [[Montclair, New Jersey]] until Hall was to start high school.\n\nAfter moving back to Minnesota, Hall went to [[Washburn High School]] in Minneapolis where she was involved in many activities. The 1963 Washburn Yearbook says, \"Candy was a member of Blue Tri, Class Play, Poplars Staff, Quill Club, Forensics, Pep Club, and Hall of Fame\"<ref name=\"gustavus.edu\"/> Blue Tri club was an organization that encouraged Christian ideals and put together service projects.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> In addition, Camilla Hall was voted class clown in High School.<ref name=\"gustavus.edu\"/> In 1963, she graduated from Washburn High School.\n\n==College life==\n\nCamilla Hall attended [[Gustavus Adolphus College]] in [[St. Peter, Minnesota]].

As their hideout burned, Hall and fellow SLA member [[Nancy Ling Perry]] exited from the back door. Police claimed that Perry came out firing a revolver while Hall was firing an automatic pistol. Police shot them immediately, killing both. Perry was shot twice. One shot hit her right lung, the other shot severed her spine. Hall was shot once in the forehead. Her body was pulled back into the burning house by SLA member [[Angela Atwood]], who also died.\n\nInvestigators working for Hall's parents claimed that Perry had come walking out of the house intending to surrender.<ref>Bryan, John.

Critical psychology challenges mainstream [[psychology]] and attempts to apply psychological understandings in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology.\n\nOne of critical psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is that it fails to consider or deliberately ignores the way [[Power (philosophy)|power]] differences between social classes and groups can affect the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people. It does this, in part, because it tends to explain behavior at the level of the individual.\n\n==Origins==\nCriticisms of mainstream psychology consistent with current critical psychology usage have existed since psychology's modern development in the late 19th century. Use of the term \"critical psychology\" started in the 1970s in Berlin at [[Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin]]. The German branch of critical psychology predates and has developed largely separately from the rest of the field. As of May 2007, only a few works have been translated into English.<ref>Klaus Holzkamp (1992): ''On Doing Psychology Critically''. Theory and Psychology 2, S.193\u2013204; for further references see also Charles Tolman (1994): ''Psychology, Society and Subjectivity: An Introduction to German Critical Psychology'', London: Routledge & Thomas Teo (1998): ''Klaus Holzkamp and the Rise and Fall of German Critical Psychology''. History of Psychology 1998, Vol. 1, Nr. 3; Wolfgang Maiers (1999): ''Critical Psychology \u2013 An Unfinished Modern Project''. In: Wolfgang Maiers et al. (Eds.): ''Challenges to Theoretical Psychology'', 457\u201366</ref> The German Critical Psychology movement is rooted in the post-war babyboomers' student revolt of the late '60s; see [[German student movement]]. [[Marx]]'s ''[[Critique of Political Economy]]'' played an important role in the German branch of the student revolt, which was centered in [[Berlin]]. Then Berlin was a capitalist city surrounded by communist-ruled [[East Germany]], represented a \"hot spot\" of political and ideological controversy for the revolutionary German students. The sociological foundations of critical psychology are decidedly Marxist.\n\n===Klaus Holzkamp===\nOne of the most important and sophisticated books in the field is the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''<ref>Klaus Holzkamp (1983): ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus</ref> (''Foundations of Psychology'') by [[Klaus Holzkamp]], who might be considered the theoretical founder of critical psychology. Holzkamp, who had written two books on theory of science<ref>Klaus Holzkamp (1964), ''Theorie und Experiment in der Psychologie''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Theory and Experiment in Psychology''); Klaus Holzkamp (1968): ''Wissenschaft als Handlung. Versuch einer neuen Grundlegung der Wissenschaftslehre''. Berlin: de Gruyter (''Science as Action \u2013 A new Approach to the Theory of Science'')</ref> and one on sensory perception<ref name=\"ekoart\">Klaus Holzkamp (1973): ''Sinnliche Erkenntnis. Historischer Ursprung und gesellschaftliche Funktion der Wahrnehmung''. Frankfurt/M.: Athen\u00e4um (''Sensory Perception: Historical Origins and Social Functions of Perception''</ref> before publishing the ''Grundlegung der Psychologie'' in 1983, thought this major work provided a solid [[paradigm]] for psychological research, as he viewed psychology as a pre-paradigmatic scientific discipline ([[T.S. Kuhn]] had used the term \"pre-paradigmatic\" for [[social science]]).\n\nHolzkamp mostly based his sophisticated attempt to provide a comprehensive and integrated set of categories defining the field of psychological research on [[Aleksey Leontyev]]'s approach to [[cultural\u2013historical psychology]] and [[activity theory]]. Leontyev had seen human action as a result of biological as well as cultural evolution and, drawing on Marx's materialist conception of culture, stressed that individual cognition is always part of social action which in turn is mediated by man-made tools (cultural artifacts), language and other man-made systems of symbols, which he viewed as a major distinguishing feature of human culture and, thus, human cognition. Another important source was Lucien S\u00e9ve's theory of personality,<ref>[http://www.marxists.org/archive/seve/index.htm Lucien Seve<!--Bot generated title-->]</ref> which provided the concept of \"social activity matrices\" as mediating structure between individual and social reproduction. At the same time, the ''Grundlegung'' systematically integrated previous specialized work done at Free University of Berlin in the '70s by critical psychologists who also had been influenced by Marx, Leontyev and Seve. This included books on [[ethology|animal behavior]]/[[ethology]],<ref>Volker Schurig (1975): ''Naturgeschichte des Psychischen 1: Psychogenese und elementare Formen der Tierkommunikation''. (''Natural History of the Psyche 1: Psychogenesis and Elementary Forms of Animal Communication''.

Psychologische Analyse der Entstehung und L\u00f6sung von Problemen''. (''Cognition. Psychological Analysis of Formulating and Solving Problems''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus</ref> He also incorporated ideas from Freud's [[psychoanalysis]] and [[Merleau-Ponty]]'s [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] into his approach.\n\nOne core result of Holzkamp's historical and comparative analysis of human reproductive action, perception and cognition is a very specific concept of meaning that identifies symbolic meaning as historically and culturally constructed, purposeful conceptual structures that humans create in close relationship to material culture and within the context of historically specific formations of social reproduction.\n\nComing from this phenomenological perspective on culturally mediated and socially situated action, Holzkamp launched a devastating and original methodological attack on behaviorism (which he termed S\u2013R (stimulus\u2013response) psychology) based on linguistic analysis, showing in minute detail the rhetorical patterns by which this approach to psychology creates the illusion of \"scientific objectivity\" while at the same time losing relevance for understanding culturally situated, intentional human actions.<ref>Klaus Holzkamp (1987): ''Die Verkennung von Handlungsbegr\u00fcndungen als empirische Zusammenhangsannahmen in sozialpsychologischen Theorien: Methodologische Fehlorientierung infolge von Begriffsverwirrung'' (''Mistaking Reasons for Causes in Theories of Social Psychology: Methodological Errors as a Result of Conceptual Confusion''), Forum Kritische Psychologie 19, Berlin: Argument Verlag, pp. 23\u201359.</ref><ref>Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung''. Frankfurt/M.: Campus, Chapter 1: \"Hinf\u00fchrung auf das Verfahren der Problementwicklung\" (''Introduction to the Sequence of Presentation''), pp. 17\u201339</ref> Against this approach, he developed his own approach to generalization and objectivity, drawing on ideas from [[Kurt Lewin]] in Chapter 9 of ''Grundlegung der Psychologie''.\n\nHis last major publication before his death in 1995 was about learning.<ref>Klaus Holzkamp (1993): ''Lernen: Subjektwissenschaftliche Grundlegung'' (''\"Learning: Subject-Scientific Foundations\"''). Frankfurt/M.: Campus</ref> It appeared in 1993 and contained a phenomenological theory of learning from the standpoint of the subject. One important concept Holzkamp developed was \"reinterpretation\" of theories developed by conventional psychology. This meant to look at these concepts from the standpoint of the paradigm of critical psychology, thereby integrating their useful insights into critical psychology while at the same time identifying and criticizing their limiting implications, which in the case of S\u2013R psychology were the rhetorical elimination of the subject and intentional action, and in the case of cognitive psychology which did take into account subjective motives and intentional actions, [[methodological individualism]]. \n\nThe first part of the book thus contains an extensive look at the history of psychological theories of learning and a minute re-interpretation of those concepts from the perspective of the paradigm of critical psychology, which focuses on intentional action situated in specific socio-historical/cultural contexts. The conceptions of learning he found most useful in his own detailed analysis of \"classroom learning\" came from cognitive anthropologists [[Jean Lave]] ([[situated learning]]) and [[Edwin Hutchins]] ([[distributed cognition]]). \n\nThe book's second part contained an extensive analysis on the modern state's institutionalized forms of \"classroom learning\" as the cultural\u2013historical context that shapes much of modern learning and [[socialization]]. In this analysis, he heavily drew upon [[Michel Foucault]]'s '''''[[Discipline and Punish]]'''''. Holzkamp felt that classroom learning as the historically specific form of learning does not make full use of student's potentials, but rather limits her or his learning potentials by a number of \"teaching strategies.\" Part of his motivation for the book was to look for alternative forms of learning that made use of the enormous potential of the human psyche in more fruitful ways. Consequently, in the last section of the book, Holzkamp discusses forms of \"expansive learning\" that seem to avoid the limitations of classroom learning, such as apprenticeship and learning in contexts other than classrooms.  \n\nThis search culminated in plans to write a major work on [[life leadership]] in the specific historical context of modern (capitalist) society. Due to his death in 1995, this work never got past the stage of early (and premature) conceptualizations, some of which were published in the journals ''Forum Kritische Psychologie'' and ''Argument''.<ref>Klaus Holzkamp (1995): ''Allt\u00e4gliche Lebensf\u00fchrung als subjektwissenschaftliches Grundkonzept'' ''(Everyday Life Leadership as Basic Concept of a Scientific Theory of the Subject)''. Das Argument, 37. Jahrgang, Heft 6, November/December 1995</ref>\n\n===1960s\u20131970s===\nIn the 1960s and 1970s the term ''radical psychology'' was used by psychologists to denote a branch of the field which rejected conventional psychology's focus on the individual as the basic unit of analysis and sole source of psychopathology. Instead, radical psychologists examined the role of society in causing and treating problems and looked towards social change as an alternative to therapy to treat mental illness and as a means of preventing psychopathology. Within psychiatry the term ''[[anti-psychiatry]]'' was often used and now British activists prefer the term ''[[critical psychiatry]]''. ''Critical psychology'' is currently the preferred term for the discipline of psychology keen to find alternatives to the way the discipline of psychology reduces human experience to the level of the individual and thereby strips away possibilities for radical social change.\n\n===1990s===\nStarting in the 1990s a new wave of books started to appear on critical psychology, the most influential being the edited book ''Critical Psychology'' by Dennis Fox and Isaac Prilleltensky. Various introductory texts to critical psychology written in the United Kingdom have tended to focus on discourse, but this has been seen by some proponents of critical psychology as a reduction of human experience to language which is as politically dangerous as the way mainstream psychology reduces experience to the individual mind.  Attention to language and ideological processes, others would argue, is essential to effective critical psychology - it is not simply a matter of applying mainstream psychological concepts to issues of social change.\n\n===Ian Parker===\nIn 1999 [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]] published an influential manifesto in both the online journal ''Radical Psychology'' and the [[Annual Review of Critical Psychology]]. This manifesto argues that critical psychology should include the following four components:\n# Systematic examination of how some varieties of psychological action and experience are privileged over others, how dominant accounts of \"psychology\" operate ideologically and in the service of power;\n# Study of the ways in which all varieties of psychology are culturally historically constructed, and how alternative varieties of psychology may confirm or resist ideological assumptions in mainstream models;\n# Study of forms of surveillance and self-regulation in everyday life and the ways in which psychological culture operates beyond the boundaries of academic and professional practice; and\n# Exploration of the way everyday \"ordinary psychology\" structures academic and professional work in psychology and how everyday activities might provide the basis for resistance to contemporary disciplinary practices.\n\n===Critical psychology today===\nThere are a few international journals devoted to critical psychology, including the no longer published ''International Journal of Critical Psychology''  (continued in the journal Subjectivity) and the ''Annual Review of Critical Psychology''. The journals still tend to be directed to an academic audience, though the ''Annual Review of Critical Psychology'' runs as an open-access online journal. There are close links between critical psychologists and critical psychiatrists in Britain through the Asylum Collective. [[David Smail (psychologist)|David Smai]]<nowiki/>l was one of the founders of The Midlands Psychology Group, a critical psychology collective who produced a manifesto for a social materialist psychology of distress.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.midpsy.org/draft_manifesto.htm|title=Draft Manifesto for a Social Materialist Psychology of Distress|last=Midlands Psychology Group|first=|date=|website=midpsy.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref> Critical psychology courses and research concentrations are available at Manchester Metropolitan University, York St Johns University, the University of East London, the University of Edinburgh, the University of KwaZulu Natal, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, and the University of West Georgia. Undergraduate concentrations can also be found at the California Institute of Integral Studies and Prescott College.\n\n==Extensions==\nLike many critical applications, critical psychology has expanded beyond Marxist and feminist roots to benefit from other critical approaches. Consider ecopsychology and [[transpersonal psychology]]. Critical psychology and related work has also sometimes been labelled [[radical psychology]] and [[liberation psychology]]. In the field of developmental psychology, the work of [[Erica Burman]] has been influential.\n\nVarious sub-disciplines within psychology have begun to establish their own critical orientations. Perhaps the most extensive are [[International Society of Critical Health Psychology|critical health psychology]] and [[community psychology]].\n\n==Internationally==\nAn early international overview of critical psychology perspectives can be found in Critical Psychology: Voices for Change, edited by Tod Sloan (Macmillan, 2000).  In 2015, Ian Parker edited the Handbook of Critical Psychology.\n===Germany===\nAt FU-Berlin, critical psychology was not really seen as a division of psychology and followed its own methodology, trying to reformulate traditional psychology on an unorthodox [[Marxist]] base and drawing from Soviet ideas of [[cultural\u2013historical psychology]], particularly [[Aleksey Leontyev]]. Some years ago the department of critical psychology at FU-Berlin was merged into the traditional psychology department.\n\nAn April 2009 issue of the Sage journal ''Theory & Psychology''<ref>[http://tap.sagepub.com/content/vol19/issue2/?etoc Special Issue: German Critical Psychology: Interventions in Honor of Klaus Holzkamp]</ref> (edited by Desmond Painter, Athanasios Marvakis, and Leendert Mos) is devoted to an examination of German critical psychology.\n\n===South Africa===\nThe University of KwaZulu-Natal in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]], is one of few worldwide to offer a Master's course in critical psychology.<ref>[http://www.ukzn.ac.za/psychology/default.asp University of KwaZulu-Natal: Critical psychology]</ref> For an overview of critical psychology in South Africa, see Desmond Painter and Martin Terre Blanche's article on \"Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards\".<ref>[http://www.criticalmethods.org/collab/critpsy.htm Critical Psychology in South Africa: Looking back and looking forwards]</ref> They have also now started a critical psychology blog.<ref>[http://critpsy.blogspot.com/ Critical Psychology] </ref>\n\n===United States and Canada===\nCritical psychology in the United States and Canada has, for the most part, focused on critiques of mainstream psychology's support for an unjust ''status quo''.<ref>[[Bruce E.

Now, as never before,<br> the old phrase has a literal meaning: We are all in the same boat.\"|source=[[Jacques Cousteau]]}}\nBoats were almost exclusively used for working purposes prior to the nineteenth century. In 1857, the philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]], with his book ''Canoeing in Wilderness'' chronicling his canoe voyaging in the wilderness of Maine, was the first to convey the enjoyment of spiritual and lifestyle aspects of cruising.\n\n[[Image:AnInlandVoyageBarge.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'Canal barges in Belgium', an image from [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s book, ''[[An Inland Voyage]]''.]]\nThe modern conception of cruising for pleasure was first popularised by the Scottish explorer and sportsman [[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]. He was introduced to the canoes and kayaks of the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] on a camping trip in 1858, and on his return to the United Kingdom constructed his own 'double-ended' canoe in [[Lambeth]]. The boat, nicknamed 'Rob Roy' after a famous relative of his, was built of lapstrake oak planking, decked in cedar covered with rubberized canvas with an open cockpit in the center. He cruised around the waterways of Britain, Europe and the Middle East and wrote a popular book about his experiences, ''A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe''.\n\nIn 1866, Macgregor was a moving force behind the establishment of the [[Royal Canoe Club]], the first club in the world to promote pleasure cruising.<ref>[http://sports.london-2012.co.uk/Kayaking/ Canoe and Kayak] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080822061202/http://sports.london-2012.co.uk/Kayaking/ |date=August 22, 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/history_uk.asp?DiscCode=CF&sportCode=CA Olympic Canoe and Kayak Flatwater History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403160838/http://www.olympic.org/uk/sports/programme/history_uk.asp?DiscCode=CF&sportCode=CA |date=April 3, 2015 }}</ref> The first recorded [[regatta]] was held on April 27, 1867, and it received Royal patronage in 1873. The latter part of the century saw cruising for leisure being enthusiastically taken up by the middle class. The author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' in 1877 as a [[travel literature|travelogue]] on his [[canoe]]ing trip through [[France]] and [[Belgium]]. Stevenson and his companion, Sir [[Simpson baronets|Walter Grindlay Simpson]] travelled in two 'Rob Roys' along the [[Oise River]] and witnessed the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] beauty of rural Europe.\n\nThe Canadian-American [[Joshua Slocum]] was one of the first people to carry out a long-distance sailing voyage for pleasure, [[circumnavigation|circumnavigating]] the world between 1895 and 1898. Despite opinion that such a voyage was impossible, Slocum rebuilt a derelict {{convert|37|ft|m|adj=on}} sloop ''Spray'' and sailed her [[single-handed sailing|single-handed]] around the world.  His book ''Sailing Alone Around the World'' was a classic adventure, and inspired many others to take to the seas.<ref>''Sailing Alone Around the World'', Captain Joshua Slocum; Sheridan House, 1954. {{ISBN|0-911378-20-0}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Dugout in San Blas Islands.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Cruisers can see traditional life in remote areas of the world; here, a [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] paddles a dugout canoe in the [[San Blas Islands]].]]\nOther cruising authors have provided both inspiration and instruction to prospective cruisers.  Key among these during the post World War II period are Electa and [[Irving Johnson]], [[Miles and Beryl Smeeton]], [[Bernard Moitessier]], [[Peter Pye]], and Eric and Susan Hiscock. During the 1970s - 1990s [[Robin Lee Graham]], [[Lin and Larry Pardey]], [[Annie Hill]], Herb Payson, Linda and Steve Dashew, Margaret and [[Hal Roth]], and Beth Leonard & [[Evans Starzinger]] have provided inspiration for people to set off voyaging.\n\nThe development of ocean crossing rallies, most notably the ARC ([[Atlantic Rally for Cruisers]]), have encouraged less experienced sailors to undertake ocean crossings.  These rallies provide a group of sailors crossing the same ocean at the same time with safety inspections, weather information and social functions.\n\n==Types of boats used==\n[[File:Yacht-Samar.jpg|thumb|250px|A motor [[yacht]] in Lorient, Bretagne, France]]\nCruising is done on both [[sailboat|sail]] and [[motorboat|power]] boats, [[monohull]]s and [[multihull]]s although sail predominates over longer distances, as ocean-going power boats are considerably more expensive to purchase and operate. The size of the typical cruising boat has increased over the years and is currently in the range of 10 to 15 metres (33 to 50 feet) although<ref>[http://www.yachtcouncil.com/boating-stories.asp?t=stories&news_id=248 Around the world boat yachts and equipment]</ref> smaller boats have been used in around-the-world trips, but are generally not recommended given the dangers involved.<ref>[http://www.dixdesign.com/steward.htm Anthony Steward sailing around the world in small boat]</ref><ref>[http://www.inthepresentsea.com/escape.html Webb Chiles giving advice on sailing the globe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906132830/http://www.inthepresentsea.com/escape.html |date=2008-09-06 }}</ref> Many cruisers are \"long term\" and travel for many years, the most adventurous among them [[Circumnavigation|circle the globe]] over a period of three to ten years. Many others take a year or two off from work and school for shorter trips and the chance to experience the cruising lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cruise Ship Styles And Differences|url=http://www.cruiseholidaysguide.com/Article/Cruise-Ship-Styles-and-Differences-244|publisher=www.CruiseHolidaysGuide.com|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Blue-water Cruising and Coastal Cruising ==\nBlue-water cruising is more involved and inherently more dangerous than coastal cruising. \nBefore embarking on an open-ocean voyage, planning and preparation will include studying charts, weather reports/warnings, almanacs and navigation books of the route to be followed. In addition, supplies need to be stocked (including fresh water and fuel), navigation instruments checked and the ship itself needs to be inspected and the crew needs to be given exact instruction on the jobs are expected to perform (e.g. the watch; which is generally 4 hours on and 4 hours off, navigation, steering, rigging sails, ...). In addition, the crew needs to be well trained at working together and with the ship in question. Finally, the sailor must be mentally prepared for dealing with harsh situations. There have been many well-documented cases where sailors had to be rescued simply because they were not sufficiently prepared (the sailors as well as the ship) or lacked experience for their venture and ran into serious trouble.\n\nSailing near the coast (coastal cruising) gives a certain amount of safety. A ship is always granted '[[innocent passage]]' through the country (most countries usually [[Territorial waters|claim up to {{convert|22|km|0|abbr=on}} off the coast]]). When this method is practiced however, if the ship needs to stop (e.g. for repairs), a trip to a customs checkpoint to have [[passport]]s checked would be required.\n\n== Equipment ==\nCruisers use a variety of equipment and techniques to make their voyages possible, or simply more comfortable. \nThe use of wind vane [[Self-steering gear|self steering]] was common on long distance cruising yachts but is increasingly being supplemented or replaced by electrical auto-pilots.\n\n[[Image:Solar panels on yacht at sea.jpg|thumb|right|The [[solar panel]]s on this {{convert|28|ft|m|adj=on}} yacht can keep her self-sufficient in electrical power.]]\n\nThough in the past many cruisers had no means of generating [[electricity]] on board and depended on [[kerosene]] and dry-cell [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], today electrical demands are much higher and nearly all cruisers have electrical devices such as lights, communications equipment and refrigeration.  Although most boats can generate power from their inboard engines, an increasing number carry auxiliary generators. Carrying sufficient fuel to power engine and generator over a long voyage can be a problem, so many cruising boats are equipped with other ancillary generating devices such as [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s, [[wind turbine]]s and towed turbines. Cruisers choosing to spend extended time in very remote locations with minimal access to marinas can opt to equip their vessels with [[watermaker]]s ([[reverse-osmosis]] seawater desalination units) used to convert sea water to potable [[fresh water]].\n\n[[Communications satellite|Satellite communication]]s are becoming more common on cruising boats.  Many boats are now equipped with [[satellite telephone]] systems; however, these systems can be expensive to use, and may operate only in certain areas. Many cruisers still use [[High frequency|short wave]] maritime [[single-sideband modulation|SSB]] and [[amateur radio]], which has no running costs. These radios provide two-way voice communications, can receive weather fax graphics or [[GRIB]] files via a laptop computer, and with a compatible modem (e.g. [[PACTOR]]) can send and receive email at very slow speed. Such emails are usually limited to basic communication using plain text, without [[HTML]] formatting or attachments.\n\nAwareness of impending [[weather]] conditions is particularly important to cruising sailors who are often far from safe harbours and need to steer clear of dangerous weather conditions.  Most cruising boats are equipped with a barometer or a weather station that records barometric pressure as well as temperature and provides rudimentary forecasting.  For more sophisticated weather forecasting, cruisers rely on their ability to receive forecasts by radio, phone or satellite.\n\nIn order to avoid collisions with other vessels, cruisers rely on a maintaining a regular watch schedule. At night, color-coded running lights help determine the position and orientation of vessels. [[Radar]] and [[Automatic identification system|AIS]] systems are often employed to detect vessels positions and movement in all conditions (day, night, rain and fog).\n\nCruisers navigate using paper charts and [[radar]].  Modern yachts are often also equipped with a [[chartplotter]] which enables the use of electronic charts and is linked to [[GPS]] satellites that provide position reports.  Some chartplotters have the ability to interface charts and radar images.  Those that still wish to work with traditional charts as well as with GPS may do so using a [[Yeoman Plotter]]. Certain advanced sailing vessels have a completely [[automated sailing system]] which includes a plotter, as well as course correcting through a link with the ship's steering organs (e.g. sails, propeller). One such device can be found at the [[The Maltese Falcon (yacht)|Maltese Falcon]].\n\n==Expense==\nPurchasing and maintaining a yacht can be costly. Most cruising sailors do not own a house and consider their boat their home during the duration of their cruise. Many cruisers find they spend, on average, 4% of their boat's purchase price annually on boat maintenance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beyond the Glitz and Glitter|url=http://www.yachtsurvey.com/boatbuying.htm|publisher=Yacht Survey|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nLike living a conventional life on land, the cost of cruising is variable. How much a person ends up spending depends largely on their spending habits (for example, eating out a lot and frequenting marinas vs. preparing local foods aboard and anchoring out) and the type of boat (fancy modern production boats are very expensive to purchase and maintain, while low-key cruising boats often involve much lower expenses). Most long-term cruisers prefer to live a simple life, usually with far lower expenses than people who live ashore.\n\nAn alternative solution is to [[Boat sharing|sail on someone else's yacht]]. Those who know how to sail can sometimes find boats looking for an extra crewmember for a long trip, while some non-sailors are also able to find boats willing to carry a hitch-hiker.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catching a Ride Across the Atlantic|url=http://www.yachtmollymawk.com/2011/03/hich-hiking-across-the-atlantic/|publisher=www.yachtmollymawk.com|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref> Crew-finding websites exist to help match-up people looking for a crossing with yachts with a berth available or looking for a temporary crewmember, [[Find a Crew]] for example. Another common tactic for finding a yacht is to visit local [[yacht club]]s and [[marina]]s and get to know the sailors there, in the hope that one of them will be able to provide a berth.\n\n== Safety ==\nTravel by water brings hazards: collision, weather, and equipment failure can lead to dangerous situations such as a sinking or severely disabled and dangerous vessel.  For this reason many long distance cruising yachts carry with them emergency equipment such as [[SART]]s, [[EPIRB]]s and [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|liferaft]]s or proactive lifeboats. Medical emergencies are also of concern, as a medical emergency can occur on a long passage when the closest port is over a week away.  For this reason before going cruising many people go through first aid training and carry medical kits. In some parts of the world (e.g., near the Horn of Africa) [[piracy]] can be a problem.\n\n== Other kinds of maritime cruising ==\n*'''Camp cruising''', also known as '''beach cruising''' or '''gunkhole cruising''', is a form of cruising in which sailors sail from point to point in an open or semi-enclosed boat, generally remaining within sight of land.  Camp cruisers either camp ashore (\"camp cruising\" or \"beach cruising\"), or aboard the boat at anchor.  The boats used may be specialized cruising [[Dinghy|dinghies]], small [[keelboat]]s, [[trailer sailer]]s or general purpose daysailing or racing boats pressed into service for the purpose.\n*''' Commute cruising''', also known as '''seasonal cruising''', is becoming increasingly popular.  Commute cruisers live aboard and sail for a few months at a time, exploring new or favorite areas, then leave the vessel in a new location or maybe return it to the same location, travel home for a few months, and return to the vessel to continue cruising during favorable seasons.  This type of cruising is somewhat akin to owning a second home that travels by sea and allows for a dual lifestyle.\n*'''Daysailing''' is recreational sailing that does not involve [[Dinghy racing|racing]] or cruising.   Many [[Dinghy racing|racers]] refer to all non-racers as \"cruisers\", including [[Dinghy sailing|dinghy]] and small keelboat sailors who primarily focus on daysailing.\n*Travel on '''[[cruise ship]]s''' may be referred to as ''cruising''. Those who take frequent cruise ship vacations may be called ''cruisers''.\n* '''Expedition cruising''', where the trips can be a combination of scientists working and tourists along for the adventure, or where scientists lead a group of tourists in order for the tourists to observe animals, plants or natural phenomena.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Boat building]]\n* [[Cabin Cruiser]]\n* [[Electric boat]]\n* [[Gunkholing]]\n* [[Maritime mobile amateur radio]]\n* [[River cruise]]\n* [[Sailboat]]\n* [[The Cruising Association]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Handbook_of_Offshore_Cruising.html?id=Xs1aPwAACAAJ\n|title= Handbook of offshore cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising\n|authors= Jim Howard, Charles J.

It usually occurs when a liquid is subjected to rapid changes of [[pressure]] that cause the formation of cavities in the liquid where the pressure is relatively low. When subjected to higher pressure, the voids implode and can generate an intense [[shock wave]].\n\nCavitation is a significant cause of wear in some [[engineering]] contexts. Collapsing voids that implode near to a metal surface cause [[cyclic stress]] through repeated implosion. This results in surface fatigue of the metal causing a type of wear also called \"cavitation\". The most common examples of this kind of wear are to pump impellers, and bends where a sudden change in the direction of liquid occurs. Cavitation is usually divided into two classes of behavior: inertial (or transient) cavitation and non-inertial cavitation.\n\nInertial cavitation is the process where a void or bubble in a liquid rapidly collapses, producing a [[shock wave]]. Inertial cavitation occurs in nature in the strikes of [[mantis shrimp]]s and [[pistol shrimp]]s, as well as in the [[vascular tissue]]s of plants. In man-made objects, it can occur in [[control valves]], [[pump]]s, [[propeller]]s and [[impeller]]s.\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which a bubble in a fluid is forced to oscillate in size or shape due to some form of energy input, such as an [[Sound|acoustic field]]. Such cavitation is often employed in [[ultrasonic cleaning]] baths and can also be observed in pumps, propellers, etc.\n\nSince the shock waves formed by collapse of the voids are strong enough to cause significant damage to moving parts, cavitation is usually an undesirable phenomenon. It is very often specifically avoided in the design of machines such as turbines or propellers, and eliminating cavitation is a major field in the study of [[fluid dynamics]]. However, it is sometimes useful and does not cause damage when the bubbles collapse away from machinery, such as in [[supercavitation]].\n\n== Physics ==\n\nInertial cavitation was first observed in the late 19th century, considering the collapse of a spherical void within a liquid. When a volume of liquid is subjected to a sufficiently low [[pressure]], it may rupture and form a cavity. This phenomenon is coined ''cavitation inception'' and may occur behind the blade of a rapidly rotating propeller or on any surface vibrating in the liquid with sufficient amplitude and acceleration. A fast-flowing river can cause cavitation on rock surfaces, particularly when there is a drop-off, such as on a waterfall.\n\nOther ways of generating cavitation voids involve the local deposition of energy, such as an intense focused laser pulse (optic cavitation) or with an electrical discharge through a spark. [[Vapor]] gases evaporate into the cavity from the surrounding medium; thus, the cavity is not a perfect vacuum, but has a relatively low gas pressure. Such a low-pressure  bubble in a liquid begins to collapse due to the higher pressure of the surrounding medium. As the bubble collapses, the pressure and temperature of the vapor within increases. The bubble eventually collapses to a minute fraction of its original size, at which point the gas within dissipates into the surrounding liquid [[wiktionary:via#Preposition|via]] a rather violent mechanism which releases a significant amount of energy in the form of an acoustic shock wave and as [[sonoluminesence|visible light]]. At the point of total collapse, the temperature of the vapor within the bubble may be several thousand [[kelvin]], and the pressure several hundred atmospheres.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=64|pages=233\u2013252|date=1985|title=Free radical generation by ultrasound in aqueous and nonaqueous solutions|last1=Riesz|first1=P.|first2=D.|last2=Berdahl|first3=C.L.|last3=Christman|pmc=1568618|doi=10.2307/3430013|pmid=3007091|jstor=3430013}}</ref>\n\nInertial cavitation can also occur in the presence of an acoustic field. Microscopic gas bubbles that are generally present in a liquid will be forced to oscillate due to an applied acoustic field. If the acoustic intensity is sufficiently high, the bubbles will first grow in size and then rapidly collapse. Hence, inertial cavitation can occur even if the [[rarefaction]] in the liquid is insufficient for a Rayleigh-like void to occur. High-power [[ultrasonics]] usually utilize the inertial cavitation of microscopic vacuum bubbles for treatment of surfaces, liquids, and slurries.\n\nThe physical process of cavitation inception is similar to [[boiling]]. The major difference between the two is the [[thermodynamic]] paths that precede the formation of the vapor. Boiling occurs when the local temperature of the liquid reaches the [[saturation temperature]], and further heat is supplied to allow the liquid to sufficiently [[phase transition|phase change]] into a gas. Cavitation inception occurs when the local pressure falls sufficiently far below the saturated vapor pressure, a value given by the tensile strength of the liquid at a certain temperature.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher|title=Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25017/1/cavbubdynam.pdf|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=27 February 2015|pages=21}}</ref>\n\nIn order for cavitation inception to occur, the cavitation \"bubbles\" generally need a surface on which they can [[nucleation|nucleate]]. This surface can be provided by the sides of a container, by [[impurity|impurities]] in the liquid, or by small undissolved microbubbles within the liquid. It is generally accepted that [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] surfaces stabilize small bubbles. These pre-existing bubbles start to grow unbounded when they are exposed to a pressure below the threshold pressure, termed Blake's threshold.\n\nThe vapor pressure here differs from the meteorological definition of vapor pressure, which describes the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. Vapor pressure as relating to cavitation refers to the vapor pressure in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) [[vapor pressure]].\n\nNon-inertial cavitation is the process in which small bubbles in a liquid are forced to oscillate in the presence of an acoustic field, when the intensity of the acoustic field is insufficient to cause total bubble collapse. This form of cavitation causes significantly less erosion than inertial cavitation, and is often used for the cleaning of delicate materials, such as [[silicon wafer]]s.\n\n==Hydrodynamic cavitation==\nHydrodynamic cavitation describes the process of vaporisation, bubble generation and bubble implosion which occurs in a flowing liquid as a result of a decrease and subsequent increase in local pressure. Cavitation will only occur if the local pressure declines to some point below the saturated [[vapor pressure]] of the liquid and subsequent recovery above the vapor pressure. If the recovery pressure is not above the vapor pressure then flashing is said to have occurred. In pipe systems, cavitation typically occurs either as the result of an increase in the kinetic energy (through an area constriction) or an increase in the pipe elevation.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can be produced by passing a liquid through a constricted channel at a specific [[flow velocity]] or by mechanical rotation of an object through a liquid.  In the case of the constricted channel and based on the specific (or unique) geometry of the system, the combination of pressure and kinetic energy can create the hydrodynamic cavitation cavern downstream of the local constriction generating high energy cavitation bubbles.\n\nThe process of bubble generation, and the subsequent growth and collapse of the cavitation bubbles, results in very high energy densities and in very high local temperatures and local pressures at the surface of the bubbles for a very short time.  The overall liquid medium environment, therefore, remains at ambient conditions.  When uncontrolled, cavitation is damaging; by controlling the flow of the cavitation, however, the power can be harnessed and non-destructive.  Controlled cavitation can be used to enhance chemical reactions or propagate certain unexpected reactions because free radicals are generated in the process due to disassociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}\n\nOrifices and venturi are reported to be widely used for generating cavitation. A venturi has an inherent advantage over an orifice because of its smooth converging and diverging sections, such that it can generate a higher flow velocity at the throat for a given pressure drop across it. On the other hand, an orifice has an advantage that it can accommodate a greater number of holes (larger perimeter of holes) in a given cross sectional area of the pipe.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Vijayanand S. |last=Moholkar |first2=Aniruddha B. |last2=Pandit |doi=10.1002/aic.690430628 |year=1997 |title=Bubble Behavior in Hydrodynamic Cavitation: Effect of Turbulence |journal=AIChe Journal |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1641\u20131648 }}</ref>\n\nThe cavitation phenomenon can be controlled to enhance the performance of high-speed marine vessels and projectiles, as well as in material processing technologies, in medicine, etc. Controlling the cavitating flows in liquids can be achieved only by advancing the mathematical foundation of the cavitation processes. These processes are manifested in different ways, the most common ones and promising for control being bubble cavitation and supercavitation. The first exact classical solution should perhaps be credited to the well- known solution by H. Helmholtz in 1868. The earliest distinguished studies of academic type on the theory of a cavitating flow with free boundaries and supercavitation were published in the book ''Jets, wakes and cavities''<ref>Birkhoff, G, Zarantonello. E (1957) Jets, wakes and cavities. New York: Academic Press.  406p.</ref>  followed by ''Theory of jets of ideal fluid''.<ref>Gurevich, MI (1978) Theory of jets of ideal fluid.  Nauka, Moscow, 536p. (in Russian)</ref> Widely used in these books was the well-developed theory of conformal mappings of functions of a complex variable, allowing one to derive a large number of exact solutions of plane problems.

Backbone Publishing Company, 598pp.</ref>  \u2013 an encyclopedic work encompassing all the best advances in this domain for the last three decades, and blending the classical methods of mathematical research with the modern capabilities of computer technologies. These include elaboration of nonlinear numerical methods of solving 3D cavitation problems, refinement of the known plane linear theories, development of asymptotic theories of axisymmetric and nearly axisymmetric flows, etc. As compared to the classical approaches, the new trend is characterized by expansion of the theory into the 3D flows. It also reflects a certain correlation with current works of an applied character on the hydrodynamics of supercavitating bodies.\n\nHydrodynamic cavitation can also improve some industrial processes. For instance, cavitated corn slurry shows higher yields in [[ethanol]] production compared to uncavitated corn slurry in dry milling facilities.<ref>[[Oleg Kozyuk]]; [http://www.arisdyne.com/ Arisdyne Systems Inc.]; US patent US 7,667,082 B2; Apparatus and Method for Increasing Alcohol Yield from Grain</ref>\n\nThis is also used in the mineralization of bio-refractory compounds which otherwise would need extremely high temperature and pressure conditions since free radicals are generated in the process due to the dissociation of vapors trapped in the cavitating bubbles, which results in either the intensification of the chemical reaction or may even result in the propagation of certain reactions not possible under otherwise ambient conditions.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gogate |first=P.

Many industrial mixing machines are based upon this design principle. It is usually achieved through impeller design or by forcing the mixture through an annular opening that has a narrow entrance orifice with a much larger exit orifice. In the latter case, the drastic decrease in pressure as the liquid accelerates into a larger volume induces cavitation. This method can be controlled with [[hydraulic]] devices that control inlet orifice size, allowing for dynamic adjustment during the process, or modification for different substances. The surface of this type of mixing valve, against which surface the cavitation bubbles are driven causing their implosion, undergoes tremendous mechanical and thermal localized stress; they are therefore often constructed of super-hard or tough materials such as [[stainless steel]], [[Stellite]], or even [[polycrystalline diamond]] (PCD).\n\nCavitating [[water purification]] devices have also been designed, in which the extreme conditions of cavitation can break down pollutants and organic molecules. Spectral analysis of light emitted in [[sonochemistry|sonochemical reactions]] reveal chemical and plasma-based mechanisms of energy transfer. The light emitted from cavitation bubbles is termed [[sonoluminescence]].\n\nUse of this technology has been tried successfully in alkali refining of vegetable oils.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctinanotech.com/technology/edible-oil-refining|title=Edible Oil Refining|publisher=Cavitation Technologies, Inc.|accessdate=2016-01-04}}</ref><!-- Site down on 2016-01-07, but Google cache works. -->\n\nHydrophobic chemicals are attracted underwater by cavitation as the pressure difference between the bubbles and the liquid water forces them to join together.

In devices such as [[propeller]]s and [[pump]]s, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of [[Tidal stream generator|tidal stream turbines]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Buckland H. C. |first2=Baker T. |last2=Orme J. A.

The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military [[submarine]]s, as it increases the chances of being detected by [[passive sonar]].\n\nAlthough the collapse of a small cavity is a relatively low-energy event, highly localized collapses can erode metals, such as steel, over time. The pitting caused by the collapse of cavities produces great wear on components and can dramatically shorten a propeller's or pump's lifetime.\n\nAfter a surface is initially affected by cavitation, it tends to erode at an accelerating pace. The cavitation pits increase the turbulence of the [[fluid flow]] and create crevices that act as nucleation sites for additional cavitation bubbles. The pits also increase the components' surface area and leave behind residual stresses. This makes the surface more prone to [[stress corrosion cracking|stress corrosion]].<ref>{{Cite journal|author1=Stachowiak, G.W. |author2=Batchelor, A.W. | title=Engineering tribology |journal=Engineering Tribology | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-7506-7304-4 | page=525|bibcode=2005entr.book.....W }}</ref>\n\n===Pumps and propellers===\nMajor places where cavitation occurs are in pumps, on propellers, or at restrictions in a flowing liquid.\n\nAs an impeller's (in a pump) or propeller's (as in the case of a ship or submarine) blades move through a fluid, low-pressure areas are formed as the fluid accelerates around and moves past the blades. The faster the blade moves, the lower the pressure around it can become. As it reaches [[vapor pressure]], the fluid [[vaporization|vaporizes]] and forms small [[liquid bubble|bubble]]s of gas. This is cavitation. When the bubbles collapse later, they typically cause very strong local shock waves in the fluid, which may be audible and may even damage the blades.\n\nCavitation in pumps may occur in two different forms:\n\n====Suction cavitation====\n[[Suction]] cavitation occurs when the pump suction is under a low-pressure/high-vacuum condition where the liquid turns into a vapor at the eye of the pump impeller. This vapor is carried over to the discharge side of the pump, where it no longer sees vacuum and is compressed back into a liquid by the discharge pressure. This imploding action occurs violently and attacks the face of the impeller. An impeller that has been operating under a suction cavitation condition can have large chunks of material removed from its face or very small bits of material removed, causing the impeller to look spongelike. Both cases will cause premature failure of the pump, often due to bearing failure. Suction cavitation is often identified by a sound like gravel or marbles in the pump casing.\n\nCommon causes of suction cavitation can include clogged filters, pipe blockage on the suction side, poor piping design, pump running too far right on the pump curve, or conditions not meeting NPSH (net positive suction head) requirements.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://info.triangle-pump.com/blog/pump-cavitation|title=Common Causes of Cavitation in Pumps|last=Inc.|first=Triangle Pump Components|access-date=2018-07-16}}</ref>\n\nIn automotive applications, a clogged filter in a hydraulic system (power steering, power brakes) can cause suction cavitation making a noise that rises and falls in synch with engine RPM.  It is fairly often a high pitched whine, like set of nylon gears not quite meshing correctly.\n\n====Discharge cavitation====\nDischarge cavitation occurs when the pump discharge pressure is extremely high, normally occurring in a pump that is running at less than 10% of its best efficiency point. The high discharge pressure causes the majority of the fluid to circulate inside the pump instead of being allowed to flow out the discharge. As the liquid flows around the impeller, it must pass through the small clearance between the impeller and the pump housing at extremely high flow velocity. This flow velocity causes a vacuum to develop at the housing wall (similar to what occurs in a [[Venturi effect|venturi]]), which turns the liquid into a vapor. A pump that has been operating under these conditions shows premature wear of the impeller vane tips and the pump housing. In addition, due to the high pressure conditions, premature failure of the pump's mechanical seal and bearings can be expected. Under extreme conditions, this can break the impeller shaft.\n\nDischarge cavitation in joint fluid is thought to cause the popping sound produced by bone [[Cracking joints|joint cracking]], for example by deliberately cracking one's knuckles.\n\n====Cavitation solutions====\nSince all pumps require well-developed inlet flow to meet their potential, a pump may not perform or be as reliable as expected due to a faulty suction piping layout such as a close-coupled elbow on the inlet flange. When poorly developed flow enters the pump impeller, it strikes the vanes and is unable to follow the impeller passage. The liquid then separates from the vanes causing mechanical problems due to cavitation, vibration and performance problems due to turbulence and poor filling of the impeller. This results in premature seal, bearing and impeller failure, high maintenance costs, high power consumption, and less-than-specified head and/or flow.\n\nTo have a well-developed flow pattern, pump manufacturer's manuals recommend about (10 diameters?) of straight pipe run upstream of the pump inlet flange. Unfortunately, piping designers and plant personnel must contend with space and equipment layout constraints and usually cannot comply with this recommendation. Instead, it is common to use an elbow close-coupled to the pump suction which creates a poorly developed flow pattern at the pump suction.<ref>{{cite web|last=Golomb|first=Richard|title=A new tailpipe design for GE frame-type gas turbines to substantially lower pressure losses |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=1454644|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|accessdate=2 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nWith a double-suction pump tied to a close-coupled elbow, flow distribution to the impeller is poor and causes reliability and performance shortfalls. The elbow divides the flow unevenly with more channeled to the outside of the elbow. Consequently, one side of the double-suction impeller receives more flow at a higher flow velocity and pressure while the starved side receives a highly turbulent and potentially damaging flow. This degrades overall pump performance (delivered head, flow and power consumption) and causes axial imbalance which shortens seal, bearing and impeller life.<ref>[[Pulp & Paper]] (1992), Daishowa Reduces Pump Maintenance by Installing Fluid Rotating Vanes</ref>\nTo overcome cavitation:\nIncrease suction pressure if possible.\nDecrease liquid temperature if possible.\nThrottle back on the discharge valve to decrease flow-rate.\nVent gases off the pump casing.\n\n===Control valves===\n\nCavitation can occur in [[control valves]].<ref>[[Emerson Process Management]] (2005), Control valve handbook, 4th Edition, page 136</ref>  If the actual pressure drop across the valve as defined by the upstream and downstream pressures in the system is greater than the sizing calculations allow, pressure drop flashing or cavitation may occur. The change from a liquid state to a vapor state results from the increase in flow velocity at or just downstream of the greatest flow restriction which is normally the valve port. To maintain a steady flow of liquid through a valve the flow velocity must be greatest at the vena contracta or the point where the cross sectional area is the smallest. This increase in flow velocity is accompanied by a substantial decrease in the fluid pressure which is partially recovered downstream as the area increases and flow velocity decreases. This pressure recovery is never completely to the level of the upstream pressure. If the pressure at the vena contracta drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid bubbles will form in the flow stream.  If the pressure recovers after the valve to a pressure that is once again above the vapor pressure, then the vapor bubbles will collapse and cavitation will occur.\n\n===Spillways===\nWhen water flows over a dam [[spillway]], the irregularities on the spillway surface will cause small areas of flow separation  in a high-speed flow, and, in these regions, the pressure will be lowered. If the flow velocities are high enough the pressure may fall to below the local vapor pressure of the water and vapor bubbles will form. When these are carried downstream into a high pressure region the bubbles collapse giving rise to high pressures and possible cavitation damage.\n\nExperimental investigations show that the damage on [[concrete]] chute and tunnel spillways can start at clear water flow velocities of between 12 and 15&nbsp;m/s, and, up to flow velocities of 20&nbsp;m/s, it may be possible to protect the surface by streamlining the boundaries, improving the surface finishes or using resistant materials.<ref name=\"Volkart_Rutschmann_1984\">{{cite book|author1=Vokart, P. |author2=Rutschamnn, P. |title= Rapid Flow in Spillway Chutes with and without Deflectors \u2013 A Model-Prototype Comparison, Proc.

In the cavity formed below the nappe, a local subpressure beneath the nappe is produced by which air is sucked into the flow. The complete design includes the deflection device (ramp, offset) and the air supply system.\n\n===Engines===\nSome larger [[diesel engine]]s suffer from cavitation due to high compression and undersized [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] walls. Vibrations of the cylinder wall induce alternating low and high pressure in the [[water cooling|coolant]] against the cylinder wall. The result is pitting of the cylinder wall, which will eventually let [[cooling fluid]] leak into the cylinder and combustion gases to leak into the coolant.\n\nIt is possible to prevent this from happening with the use of chemical additives in the cooling fluid that form a protective layer on the cylinder wall. This layer will be exposed to the same cavitation, but rebuilds itself. Additionally a regulated overpressure in the cooling system (regulated and maintained by the coolant filler cap spring pressure) prevents the forming of cavitation.\n\nFrom about the 1980s, new designs of smaller [[gasoline]] engines also displayed cavitation phenomena. One answer to the need for smaller and lighter engines was a smaller coolant volume and a correspondingly higher coolant flow velocity. This gave rise to rapid changes in flow velocity and therefore rapid changes of static pressure in areas of high heat transfer. Where resulting vapor bubbles collapsed against a surface, they had the effect of first disrupting protective oxide layers (of cast aluminium materials) and then repeatedly damaging the newly formed surface, preventing the action of some types of corrosion inhibitor (such as silicate based inhibitors). A final problem was the effect that increased material temperature had on the relative electrochemical reactivity of the base metal and its alloying constituents. The result was deep pits that could form and penetrate the engine head in a matter of hours when the engine was running at high load and high speed. These effects could largely be avoided by the use of organic corrosion inhibitors or (preferably) by designing the engine head in such a way as to avoid certain cavitation inducing conditions.\n\n==In nature==\n\n===Geology===\nSome hypotheses relating to [[diamond]] formation posit a possible role for cavitation\u2014namely cavitiation in the [[kimberlite]] pipes providing the extreme pressure needed to change pure [[carbon]] into the rare [[allotrope]] that is diamond.\n\nThe loudest three sounds ever recorded, during the [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], are now understood as the bursts of three huge cavitation bubbles, each larger than the last, formed in the volcano's throat.

Their origin is seen in a physical phenomenon of ultrasonic cavitation, which is well known from the technical practice.\n\n===Vascular plants===\nCavitation occurs in the [[xylem]] of [[vascular plants]] when the tension of water within the xylem exceeds [[atmospheric pressure]]. The [[sap]] vaporizes locally so that either the vessel elements or [[tracheid]]s are filled with water vapor. Plants are able to repair cavitated xylem in a number of ways. For plants less than 50&nbsp;cm tall, root pressure can be sufficient to redissolve the vapor. Larger plants direct solutes into the xylem via ''ray cells'', or in [[tracheid]]s, via osmosis through [[plant cell|bordered pits]]. Solutes attract water, the pressure rises and vapor can redissolve. In some trees, the sound of the cavitation is audible, particularly in summer, when the rate of [[evapotranspiration]] is highest. Some deciduous trees have to shed leaves in the autumn partly because cavitation increases as temperatures decrease.<ref>Sperry, J.S., Saliendra, N.Z., Pockman, W.T., Cochard, H., Cuizat, P., Davis, S.D., Ewers, F.W., & Tyree, M.T., 1996.

They are closely related to the [[Atheriniformes]] and are occasionally included with them.  A colloquial term for the order as a whole is '''toothcarps''', though they are not actually close relatives of the true [[carp]]s &ndash; the latter belong to the [[superorder]] [[Ostariophysi]], while the toothcarps are [[Acanthopterygii]].\n\nThe families of Cyprinodontiformes can be divided into three groups: [[Viviparity|viviparous]] and [[Ovoviviparity|ovoviviparous]] (all species give live birth), and [[Oviparity|oviparous]] (all species are egg-laying). The live-bearing groups differ in whether the young are carried to term within (ovoviviparous) or without (viviparous) an enclosing eggshell. [[Phylogeny|Phylogenetically]] however, one of the two [[suborders]] &ndash; the [[Aplocheiloidei]] &ndash; contains oviparous species exclusively, as do two of the four [[Superfamily (zoology)|superfamilies]] of the other suborder (the [[Cyprinodontoidea]] and [[Valencioidea]] of the [[Cyprinodontoidei]]). Vivipary and ovovivipary have [[Evolution|evolved]] independently from oviparous ancestors, the latter possibly twice.\n\n==Description==\n[[Image:Fundulopanchax scheeli.png|thumb|left|''[[Fundulopanchax scheeli]]'', a killifish of the family [[Aplocheilidae]].]]\nSome members of this order are notable for inhabiting extreme environments, such as [[saline water|saline]] or very warm waters, water of poor quality, rain water pools devoid of minerals and made acid by decaying vegetation, or isolated situations where no other types of fish occur.\n\nThey are typically [[carnivore]]s, and often live near the surface, where the oxygen-rich water compensates for environmental disadvantages. Scheel (1968) observed the gut contents were invariably ants, others have reported insects, worms and aquatic crustaceans. Aquarium specimens are invariably seen eating protozoans from the water column and the surfaces of leaves, however these are not apparent as stomach contents. North American \"pupfish\" eat plant material as well and some have adapted to a diet very high in algae to the point where one, the American Flag Fish is well known to eat algae especially thread algae in the aquarium, despite being in a family of fishes that do not generally consume any plant material. Although even this is a slight misnomer and killifish derive from some foods the carotenoids and other chemicals required to make these pigments which come from pollen grains from on the surface of and in the gut of insects they eat from the surface of the water, simulated in culture by the use of special color enhancing foods that contain them similar the same case with red factor canaries.\n\nThey are small to medium-sized fish, with small mouths, large eyes, a single [[dorsal fin]], and a rounded [[caudal fin]]. The largest species is the ''cuatro ojos'' (''[[Anableps dowi]]''), which measures {{convert|34|cm|in|abbr=on}}<ref>http://www.discoverlife.org/mp/20q?search=Anableps+dowi&flags=col3:&res=320</ref> in length, while the smallest, the least killifish (''[[Heterandria formosa]]''), is just {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} long as an adult.<ref name=EoF>{{cite book |editor1=Paxton, J.R. |editor2=Eschmeyer, W.N. |author= Parenti, Lynne R.|year=1998|title=Encyclopedia of Fishes|publisher= Academic Press|location=San Diego|pages= 148\u2013151|isbn= 0-12-547665-5}}</ref>\n\n==Systematics==\n[[Image:Guppy-male.jpg|thumb|right|[[Guppy]], a live-bearer of the [[Poeciliidae]]]]\n'''CYPRINODONTIFORMES'''\n* Suborder [[Aplocheiloidei]] (all oviparous)\n** Family [[Aplocheilidae]] &ndash; African, Asian and South American killifishes <ref name=Costa2016>Costa, W.J.E.M.

The main denominations sharing property over parts of the church are the [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] and [[Roman Catholic]], and to a lesser degree the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]], [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]].

In 630, the Emperor [[Heraclius]] restored it and rebuilt the church after recapturing the city. After Jerusalem came under Arab rule, it remained a Christian church, with the early Muslim rulers protecting the city's Christian sites. A story reports that the [[Umar|Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab]] visited the church and stopped to pray on the balcony; but at the time of prayer, he turned away from the church and prayed outside. He feared that future generations would misinterpret this gesture, taking it as a pretext to turn the church into a mosque. Eutychius added that Umar wrote a decree prohibiting Muslims from praying at this location. The building suffered severe damage due to an earthquake in 746.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sepulchrum Domini Through the Ages: Its Form and Function|last=Kroesen|first=Justin|publisher=Leuven|year=2000|isbn=9789042909526|location=|pages=11|quote=|via=WorldCat, Google Books}}</ref>\n\nEarly in the ninth century, another earthquake damaged the dome of the Anastasis. The damage was repaired in 810 by [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch Thomas]]. In the year 841, the church suffered a fire. In 935, the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] prevented the construction of a Muslim mosque adjacent to the Church.

There is a difference of opinion as to whether it is to be seen as [[Stations of the Cross|the 13th Station of the Cross]], which others identify as the [[Descent from the Cross|lowering of Jesus from the cross]] and locate between the 11th and 12th stations on Calvary.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe lamps that hang over the Stone of Unction, adorned with cross-bearing chain links, are contributed by Armenians, [[Copts]], Greeks and [[Western Christianity|Latins]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nImmediately to the left of the entrance is a bench that has traditionally been used by the church's Muslim doorkeepers, along with some Christian clergy, as well as electrical wiring.

[[Virgilio Canio Corbo]], a Franciscan priest and archaeologist, who was present at the excavations, estimated from the archaeological evidence that the western retaining wall of the temple itself would have passed extremely close to the east side of the supposed tomb; if the wall had been any further west any ''tomb'' would have been crushed under the weight of the wall (which would be immediately above it) if it had not already been destroyed when foundations for the wall were made.<ref name=\"Corbo\">{{cite book| first=Virgilio| last=Corbo|trans-title=The Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem| year=1981| title=Il Santo Sepolcro di Gerusalemme| publisher=Franciscan Press| url=https://books.google.com/?id=wYFtAAAAMAAJ| language=Italian}}</ref>\n\nOther archaeologists have criticized Corbo's reconstructions. [[Dan Bahat]], the former city archaeologist of Jerusalem, regards them as unsatisfactory, as there is no known temple of Aphrodite matching Corbo's design, and no archaeological evidence for Corbo's suggestion that the temple building was on a platform raised high enough to avoid including anything sited where the Aedicule is now; indeed Bahat notes that many temples to Aphrodite have a rotunda-like design, and argues that there is no archaeological reason to assume that the present rotunda was not based on a rotunda in the temple previously on the site.<ref name=\"BahatBAR\">{{cite journal| first=Dan| last=Bahat| title=Does the Holy Sepulchre Church Mark the Burial of Jesus?| url=http://members.bib-arch.org/publication.asp?PubID=BSBA&Volume=12&Issue=3&ArticleID=1| work=[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]| date=May\u2013June 1986| subscription=yes| accessdate=2014-09-19}}</ref>\n\n==Location==\n[[File:JerusalemBonfils.jpg|thumb|upright|Tourists and pilgrims at one of the two access gates to the Holy Sepulchre courtyard, photo by [[Bonfils]], 1870s]]\nThe New Testament describes Jesus's tomb as being outside the city wall,<ref>for example, {{Bibleverse||Hebrews|13:12|}}</ref> as was normal for burials across the ancient world, which were regarded as unclean.<ref>Toynbee, Jocelyn M.

In this line of interpretation, ''Cernach'' is taken as an epithet with a wide semantic field\u2014\"angular; victorious; bearing a prominent growth\"\u2014and Conall is seen as \"the same figure\" as the ancient Cernunnos.<ref>John Koch. (2006) Cernunnos [in] ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', p. 396. ABC-Clio.</ref>\n\nThere is even greater evidence available to connect Conall Cernach to Cernunnos than the similarity in the names. A brief passage involving Conall in an eighth-century story entitled ''T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Fra\u00edch'' (\"The Cattle Raid on Fraech\") has been questioned before for its anti-climatic conclusion to an epic Celtic tale.<ref name=\"Anne Ross 1967\">Anne Ross. (1967, 1996). ''Pagan Celtic Britain: Studies in Iconography and Tradition''. Academy Chicago Publishers.</ref> In this passage Conall Cernach is portrayed as a hero and mighty warrior who assists the protagonist Fraech in rescuing his wife and son, and in reclaiming for Fraech his cattle. The fort that Conall must penetrate is guarded by a mighty serpent. The supposed anti-climax of this tale is when the fearsome serpent, instead of attacking Conall, darts to Conall's waist and girdles him as a belt. Rather than killing the serpent, Conall allows it to live, and then proceeds to attack and rob the fort of its great treasures the serpent previously protected.\n\nCernunnos, as the conjectured Gaulish manifestation of the Roman [[Dis Pater]],<ref name=\"Anne Ross 1967\"/> is considered to share the latter's attributes of ruling over the hidden treasures of the underworld. Subterranean treasures were commonly linked in Medieval Bestiaries to the serpent,<ref>Charbonneau-Lassay, Louis. (1940). ''The Bestiary of Christ''. France: Descl\u00e9e, De Brouwer, & Cie.</ref> the occupant of the underground, or otherworld, and the keeper of its treasures and mysteries. This aspect of Cernunnos is depicted on a stone statue from a well in Sommer\u00e9court, Haute-Marne, France, and on a bronze figurine from Autun.<ref name=\"Anne Ross 1967\"/> Both statue and figurine portray Cernunnos with the two ram-headed serpents encircling his waist. This is more than just a small similarity to the instance of the serpent that guarded the treasure of the fort in ''T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Fra\u00edch'' surrendering to Conall Cernach and becoming his belt. Cernunno's connections to the deity Mars<ref name=\"Anne Ross 1967\"/> serve to underline Conall's role as hero-warrior in the tale.\n\nThe anti-climatic nature of the eighth-century Irish tale then gains significant clarity in the light of the relationship between a horned or antler-bearing deity, warrior, or progenitor, and the [[chthonic]] dwelling, treasure-guarding serpent that encircled the waist of the one it chose to protect. This universal Celtic concept comes down to us as a mere echo of its ancient self through centuries of the [[Christianization of Ireland]]. The Gaelic Cernunnos may now possibly only be found in the slight similarity of a name and the peculiarity of a single passage from a Middle Ages Irish epic.\n\n==Possible connection to Saint Ciar\u00e1n==\nSome see the qualities of Cernunnos subsumed into the ''life'' of [[Ciar\u00e1n of Saigir|Saint Ciar\u00e1n of Saighir]], one of the [[Twelve Apostles of Ireland]]. When he was building his first tiny cell, as his [[Hagiography|hagiograph]] goes, his first disciple and monk was a boar that had been rendered gentle by God. This was followed by a fox, a badger, a wolf and a stag.<ref>{{cite book| last = Mac Cana| first = Proinsias| title = Celtic Mythology| origyear = 1970| year = 1973| publisher = The Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited| location = London| isbn = 0-600-00647-6| pages = 47\u20138}}</ref>\n\n==Neopaganism==\nIn [[Wicca]] and other forms of [[Neopaganism]] a [[Horned God]] is revered; this divinity syncretises a number of horned or antlered gods from various cultures, including Cernunnos.

Examples familiar to English-speakers are the ''[[Tut-tut]]'' (British spelling) or ''Tsk! Tsk!'' (American spelling) used to express disapproval or pity, the ''[[lateral click|tchick!]]'' used to spur on a horse, and the ''[[alveolar click|clip-clop!]]'' sound children make with their tongue to imitate a horse trotting.\n\nTechnically, clicks are [[obstruent]]s articulated with two closures (points of contact) in the mouth, one forward and one at the back. The enclosed pocket of air is [[rarefaction|rarefied]] by a sucking action of the tongue (in technical terminology, clicks have a [[Airstream mechanism|lingual ingressive airstream mechanism]]). The forward closure is then released,<ref group=note>This is the case for all clicks that constitute consonants in words. Paralinguistically, however, there are other methods of making clicks: ''under'' the tongue and by releasing the rear occlusion first. See [[#Places of articulation]].</ref> producing what may be the loudest consonants in the language, but in some languages such as [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], clicks can be more subtle and may even be mistaken for [[ejective consonant|ejectives]].\n\n==Notation and sound description==\n{{IPA chart non-pulmonic consonants with audio}}\n\nClick consonants occur at five principal places of articulation. The [[International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)]] represents a click by placing the assigned symbol for the place of click articulation adjacent to a symbol for a non-click sound at the rear place of articulation. The IPA symbols are used in writing most [[Khoisan languages]], but [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] typically use [[Latin script|Latin]] {{angbr|c}}, {{angbr|x}} and {{angbr|q}} for dental, lateral and alveolar clicks respectively.\n* The easiest clicks for English speakers are the [[dental click]]s written with a single pipe, {{IPA|\u01c0}}. They are all sharp (high-pitched) squeaky sounds made by sucking on the front teeth. A simple dental click is used in English to express pity or to shame someone, and sometimes to call an animal, and is written ''tut!'' in British English and ''tsk!'' in American English. In Italian this sound means \"no\" used as an answer to a direct question, while it is used to call cats when repeated several times.\n* Next most familiar to English speakers are the [[lateral click]]s written with a double pipe, {{IPA|\u01c1}}. They are also squeaky sounds, though less sharp than {{IPA|\u01c0}}, made by sucking on the molars on either side (or both sides) of the mouth. A simple lateral click is made in English to get a horse moving, and is conventionally written ''tchick!''\n* Then there are the [[labial click]]s, written with a bull's eye, {{IPA|\u0298}}. These are lip-smacking sounds, but without the pursing of the lips found in a kiss.\n\nThe above clicks sound like [[affricate]]s, in that they involve a lot of friction. The other two families are more abrupt sounds that do not have this friction.\n* With the [[alveolar click]]s, written with an exclamation mark, {{IPA|\u01c3}}, the tip of the tongue is pulled down abruptly and forcefully from the roof of the mouth, sometimes using a lot of jaw motion, and making a hollow ''pop!'' like a cork being pulled from an empty bottle. These sounds can be quite loud.\n* Finally, the [[palatal click]]s, {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are made with a flat tongue, and are sharper popping sounds than the {{IPA|\u01c3}} clicks, like sharply snapped fingers.\n\n==Languages with clicks==\n\n=== Southern Africa ===\nClicks occur in all three [[Khoisan languages|Khoisan language families]] of [[southern Africa]], where they may be the most numerous consonants. To a lesser extent they occur in three neighbouring groups of [[Bantu languages]]\u2014which [[Sprachbund|borrowed them]], directly or indirectly, from Khoisan. In the southeast, in eastern [[South Africa]], [[Swaziland]], [[Lesotho]], [[Zimbabwe]] and southern [[Mozambique]], they were adopted from a [[Tuu languages|Tuu language]] or languages by the languages of the Nguni cluster (especially [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]], but also to a lesser extent [[Swati language|Swazi]] and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]), and spread from them in a reduced fashion to the Zulu-based [[pidgin]] [[Fanagalo]], [[Sesotho language|Sesotho]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Ronga language|Ronga]], the Mzimba dialect of [[Tumbuka language|Tumbuka]] and more recently to [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and urban varieties of [[Pedi language|Pedi]], where the spread of clicks continues. The second point of transfer was near the [[Caprivi Strip]] and the [[Okavango River]] where, apparently, the [[Yeyi language]] borrowed the clicks from a [[Khoe languages|West Kalahari Khoe language]]; a separate development led to a smaller click inventory in the neighbouring [[Mbukushu language|Mbukushu]], [[Kwangali language|Kwangali]], [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], [[Kuhane language|Kuhane]] and [[Fwe language|Fwe]] languages in [[Angola]], [[Namibia]], [[Botswana]] and [[Zambia]].<ref>Derek Nurse & G\u00e9rard Philippson (2003) ''The Bantu languages,'' pp 31\u201332</ref> These sounds occur not only in borrowed vocabulary, but have spread to native Bantu words as well, in the case of Nguni at least partially due to a type of word taboo called [[hlonipha]]. Some [[creolised]] varieties of Afrikaans, such as [[Oorlams Creole|Oorlams]], retain clicks in Khoekhoe words.\n\n=== East Africa ===\nThree languages in [[East Africa]] use clicks: [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] of [[Tanzania]], and [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]], an endangered South [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic language]] of [[Kenya]] that has clicks in only a few dozen words. It is thought the latter may remain from an episode of [[language shift]].\n\n=== Damin ===\nThe only non-African language known to have clicks as regular speech sounds is [[Damin]], a ritual code used by speakers of [[Lardil]] in [[Australia]]. One of the clicks in Damin is actually an [[Egressive sound|egressive]] click, using the tongue to compress the air in the mouth for an outward (egressive) \"spurt\".\n\n=== Types of clicks used ===\nFor the most part, the Southern African [[Khoisan languages]] only use [[root word|root]]-initial clicks.<ref group=\"note\">Exceptions occurs in words borrowed from Bantu languages, which may have click in the middle.</ref> Hadza, Sandawe and several [[Bantu languages]] also allow [[syllable]]-initial clicks within roots, but in no language does a click close a syllable or end a word. Once clicks are borrowed into a language as regular speech sounds, they may spread to native words, as has happened due to ''[[hlonipa]]'' word-taboo in the [[Nguni languages]]. In [[Gciriku language|Gciriku]], for example, the European loanword ''tomate'' (tomato) appears as ''cum\u00e1te'' with a click ''c'', though it begins with a ''t'' in all neighbouring languages.\n\nScattered clicks are found in [[ideophone]]s in other languages, such as [[Kongo language|Kongo]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3/}}, [[Mijikenda language|Mijikenda]] {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c0/}} and Hadza {{IPA|/\u0298\u0303\u02b7/}} (Hadza does not otherwise have labial clicks). Ideophones often use phonemic distinctions not found in normal vocabulary.\n\nEnglish and many other languages may use bare clicks in [[interjection]]s, without the accompaniment of vowels, such as the dental \"tsk-tsk\" sound used to express disapproval, or the lateral ''tchick'' used with horses. In [[Ningdu]] Chinese (a variety of [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]), flapped nasal clicks are used in nursery rhymes. In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[Maltese language|Maltese]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], some time in [[French language|French]], as well as southern Italian languages such as [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], a bare dental click accompanied by tipping the head upwards signifies \"no\". [[Libyan Arabic]] apparently has three such sounds.\n\nClicks occasionally turn up elsewhere, as in the special [[register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] twins sometimes develop with each other. In [[West Africa]], clicks have been reported allophonically, and similarly in German, faint clicks have been recorded in rapid speech where the consonants {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} overlap between words.<ref name=germ>{{cite conference|first=Sussanne|last=Fuchs|first2=Laura|last2=Koenig|first3=Ralf|last3=Winkler|title=Weak clicks in German|format=pdf|conference=Proceedings of the 16th International Congress of Phonetic Sciences|pages=449-452|year=2007|location=Saarbr\u00fccken|url=http://www.icphs2007.de/conference/Papers/1678/1678.pdf}}</ref>\n\nOccasionally other languages are said to have click sounds. This is usually a misnomer for [[ejective consonant]]s, which are found across much of the world.\n\n==Types of clicks==\nLike other consonants, clicks can be described using four parameters: [[place of articulation]], [[manner of articulation]], [[phonation]] (including glottalisation) and [[airstream mechanism]]. As noted above, clicks necessarily involve at least two closures, which in some cases operate partially independently: an anterior articulation traditionally represented by the special click symbol in the IPA\u2014and a posterior articulation traditionally described as oral or [[nasal consonant|nasal]], voiced or voiceless, etc. The literature also describes a contrast between [[velar consonant|velar]] and [[uvular consonant|uvular]] rear articulations for some languages.\n\nHowever, recent work shows that in languages that make this distinction, all clicks have a uvular, or even pharyngeal, rear closure\u2014and the clicks explicitly described as uvular are in fact clusters/contours of a click plus a pulmonic or ejective component, in which the cluster/contour has two release bursts, the forward (click) and then the rearward (uvular) component. \"Velar\" clicks in these languages have only a single release burst, that of the forward click release, and the release of the rear articulation isn't separately audible (Miller 2011).\n\nNonetheless, in most of the literature the stated place of the click is the anterior articulation (called the ''release'' or ''influx),'' whereas the manner is ascribed to the posterior articulation (called the ''accompaniment'' or ''efflux).'' The anterior articulation defines the ''click type'' and is written with the IPA letter for the click (dental {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c0}}}}, alveolar {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c3}}}}, etc.), whereas the traditional term 'accompaniment' conflates the categories of manner (nasal, affricated), phonation (voiced, aspirated, breathy voiced, glottalised), as well as any change in the airstream with the release of the posterior articulation (pulmonic, ejective), all of which are transcribed with additional letters or diacritics, as in the ''nasal alveolar click'', {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c3\u014b}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|\u1d51\u01c3}}}} or\u2014to take an extreme example\u2014the ''voiced (uvular) ejective alveolar click'', {{angbr|{{IPA|\u1da2\u01c3\u0361q\u02bc}}}}.\n\nThe size of click inventories ranges from as few as three (in [[Sesotho phonology#Consonants|Sesotho]]) or four (in [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]]), to dozens in the [[Kx'a languages|Kx'a]] and [[Tuu languages|Tuu]] (Northern and Southern Khoisan) languages. [[Taa language|Taa]], the last vibrant language in the latter family, has 45 to 115 click phonemes, depending on analysis (clusters vs. contours), and over 70% of words in the dictionary of this language begin with a click.<ref>L&M 1996, p 246</ref>\n\nClicks appear more [[stop consonant|stop]]-like (sharp/abrupt) or [[affricate]]-like (noisy) depending on their place of articulation: In southern Africa, clicks involving an [[apical consonant|apical]] [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] or [[laminal consonant|laminal]] [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] closure are acoustically abrupt and sharp, like stops, whereas [[labial consonant|labial]], [[dental consonant|dental]] and [[lateral consonant|lateral]] clicks typically have longer and acoustically noisier releases that are superficially more like affricates. In East Africa, however, the alveolar clicks tend to be [[flap consonant|flapped]], whereas the lateral clicks tend to be more sharp.\n\n==Transcription==\n{{further|click letter}}\nThe five click releases with dedicated symbols in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) are [[labial click|labial]] {{IPA|\u0298}}, [[dental click|dental]] {{IPA|\u01c0}}, [[palatal click|palato-alveolar]] or \"palatal\" {{IPA|\u01c2}}, [[postalveolar click|(post)alveolar]] or \"retroflex\" {{IPA|\u01c3}} and [[lateral click|lateral]] {{IPA|\u01c1}}. In most languages, the retroflex and palatal releases are \"abrupt\"; that is, they are sharp popping sounds with little frication (turbulent airflow). The labial, dental and lateral releases, on the other hand, are typically \"noisy\": they are longer, lip- or tooth-sucking sounds with turbulent airflow, and are sometimes called affricates. (This applies to the forward articulation; both may also have either an affricate or non-affricate rear articulation as well.) The [[apical consonant|apical]] releases, {{IPA|\u01c3}} and {{IPA|\u01c1}}, are sometimes called \"grave\", because their pitch is dominated by low frequencies; whereas the [[laminal consonant|laminal]] releases, {{IPA|\u01c0}} and {{IPA|\u01c2}}, are sometimes called \"acute\", because they are dominated by high frequencies. (At least in the [[N\u01c1ng language]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan]], this is associated with a difference in the placement of the rear articulation: \"grave\" clicks are [[uvular consonant|uvular]], whereas \"acute\" clicks are [[pharyngeal consonant|pharyngeal]].) Thus the alveolar click {{IPA|/\u01c3/}} sounds something like a cork pulled from a bottle (a low-pitch pop), at least in Xhosa; whereas the dental click {{IPA|/\u01c0/}} is like English ''tsk! tsk!,'' a high-pitched sucking on the incisors. The lateral clicks are pronounced by sucking on the molars of one or both sides. The labial click {{IPA|/\u0298/}} is different from what many people associate with a kiss: the lips are pressed more-or-less flat together, as they are for a {{IPA|[p]}} or an {{IPA|[m]}}, not rounded as they are for a {{IPA|[w]}}.\n\nThe most populous languages with clicks, Zulu and Xhosa, use the letters ''c, q, x,'' by themselves and in [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]], to write click consonants. Most Khoisan languages, on the other hand (with the notable exceptions of [[Naro language|Naro]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]]), use a more iconic system based on the [[Vertical bar|pipe]] {{angbr|<nowiki>|</nowiki>}}. (The exclamation point for the \"retroflex\" click was originally a pipe with a subscript dot, along the lines of ''\u1e6d, \u1e0d, \u1e47'' used to transcribe the retroflex consonants of India.) There are also two main conventions for the second letter of the digraph as well: voicing may be written with ''g'' and uvular affrication with ''x'', or voicing with ''d'' and affrication with ''g'' (a convention of Afrikaans). In two orthographies of Ju\u01c0\u2019hoan, for example, {{IPA|/\u01c3\u032c/}} is written ''g!'' or ''dq'', and {{IPA|/\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}} ''!x'' or ''qg''. In languages without {{IPA|/\u01c3\u0361\u03c7/}}, such as Zulu, {{IPA|/\u01c3\u032c/}} may be written ''gq''.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|+ Competing orthographies\n!rowspan=2| !!rowspan=2|labial!!colspan=2|laminal!!colspan=2|apical\n|-\n!dental!!palatal!!alveolar!!lateral\n|- align=center\n!

However, the Khoisan languages are poorly attested, and it is quite possible that, as they become better described, more click releases will be found.\n\nFormerly when a click consonant was transcribed, two symbols were used, one for each articulation, and connected with a tie bar. This is because a click such as {{IPA|[\u014b\u0361\u01c2]}} was analysed as a nasal velar rear articulation {{IPA|[\u014b]}} pronounced simultaneously with the forward ingressive release {{IPA|[\u01c2]}}. The symbols may be written in either order, depending on the analysis: {{angbr|{{IPA|\u014b\u0361\u01c2}}}} or {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2\u0361\u014b}}}}. However, a tie bar was not often used in practice, and when the manner is [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] (a simple {{IPA|[k]}}), it was often omitted as well. That is, {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u01c2}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2k}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u0361\u01c2}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2\u0361k}}}}. Regardless, elements that do not overlap with the release are always written according to their temporal order: Prenasalisation is always written first ({{angbr|{{IPA|\u014b\u0261\u0361\u01c2}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u0361\u0261}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|\u014b\u01c2\u032c}}}}), and the non-lingual part of a contour is always written second ({{angbr|{{IPA|k\u0361\u01c2\u02bcq\u02bc}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2\u0361k\u02bcq\u02bc}}}} = {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc}}}}).\n\nHowever, it has become standard to analyse clicks as simplex segments, as research has shown that the front and rear articulations are not independent, and to use click symbols to cover the rear articulation as well, with diacritics rather than digraphs for the accompaniments. At first this tended to be {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2}}}} for {{angbr|{{IPA|k\u0361\u01c2, \u0261\u0361\u01c2, \u014b\u0361\u01c2}}}}, based on the belief that the rear articulation was velar; but as it has become clear that the rear articulation of both \"velar\" and \"uvular\" clicks is actually uvular or even pharyngeal, voicing and nasalisation diacritics more in keeping with the IPA have started to appear: {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2, \u01c2\u032c, \u01c2\u0303, \u014b\u01c2\u032c}}}} for {{angbr|{{IPA|\u01c2, \u1da2\u01c2, \u1d51\u01c2, \u014b\u1da2\u01c2}}}}.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|+Evolution of accompaniment transcription\n|-\n! !!

For example, {{angbr|t!}} is a voiceless dental click, and {{angbr|m!}} is a nasal bilabial click. This convention is used in the literature on Damin, where the clicks are transcribed as {{angbr|m!, nh!, n!, rn!}}.\n\n==Places of articulation==\n{{main|bilabial click|dental click|palatal click|alveolar click|lateral click|retroflex click}}\n\n[[Place of articulation|Places of articulation]] are often called click ''types, releases,'' or ''influxes.'' There are seven or eight known releases, not counting slapped or egressive clicks. These are ''(bi)labial affricated'' {{IPA|\u0298}}, or \"(bi)labial\"; ''laminal denti-alveolar affricated'' {{IPA|\u01c0}}, or \"dental\"; ''apical (post)alveolar plosive'' {{IPA|\u01c3}}, or \"alveolar\"; ''laminal postalveolar (palato-alveolar) plosive'' {{IPA|\u01c2}}, or \"palatal\"; ''laminal postalveolar (palato-alveolar) affricated'' {{IPA|\u01c2\u1db4}} (known only from [[Ekoka !Kung]]); ''subapical postalveolar ([[Retroflex click|retroflex]])'' {{IPA|\u01c3\u02de}} (only known from [[Central !Kung]] and Damin); and ''apical postalveolar lateral'' {{IPA|\u01c1}}. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Basic oral clicks\n|-\n!Labial||Dental||Alveolar||Retroflex||Domed||Palatal||Lateral||Velar\n|-align=center\n|{{IPA|\u0298 \u0298\u032c}}||{{IPA|\u01c0 \u01c0\u032c}}||{{IPA|\u01c3 \u01c3\u032c}}||{{IPA|\u01c3\u02de \u01c3\u032c\u02de}}||{{IPA|\u01c2\u1db4 \u01c2\u032c\u1db4}}||{{IPA|\u01c2 \u01c2\u032c}}||{{IPA|\u01c1 \u01c1\u032c}}||{{IPA|\u029e \u029e\u032c}}\n|}\n\nLanguages illustrating each of these articulations are listed below. Given the poor state of documentation of Khoisan languages, it is quite possible that additional releases will turn up.

However, the palatal and alveolar clicks frequently have the opposite names in older literature, and they were not distinguished in the IPA until 1989. However, since Ladefoged & Traill (1984) clarified the places of articulation, the terms in the left column above have become standard.<ref group=note>A current exception is [[Unicode]], which still calls the palatal clicks 'alveolar' and the alveolar clicks 'retroflex'.</ref>\n\n==The back-vowel constraint==\n[[Image:Clicks and the BVC.svg|thumb|The shape of the tongue in Nama when articulating an alveolar click (blue) and a palatal click (red) [throat to the right]. The articulation of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is slightly forward of the red line, with its peak coinciding with the dip of the blue line.]]\nIn several languages, including [[Nama language|Nama]] and [[Ju\u01c0'hoan dialect|Ju\u01c0'hoan]], the alveolar click types {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} and {{IPA|[\u01c1]}} only occur, or preferentially occur, before [[back vowel]]s, whereas the dental and palatal clicks occur before any vowel. The effect is most noticeable with the high front vowel {{IPA|[i]}}. In Nama, for example, the diphthong {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} is common but {{IPA|[i]}} is rare after alveolar clicks, whereas the opposite is true after dental and palatal clicks. This is a common effect of [[uvular consonant|uvular]] or uvularised consonants on vowels in both click and non-click languages. In [[Taa language|Taa]], for example, the back-vowel constraint is triggered by both alveolar clicks and uvular stops, but not by palatal clicks or velar stops: sequences such as {{IPA|*/\u01c3i/}} and {{IPA|*/qi/}} are rare to non-existent, whereas sequences such as {{IPA|/\u01c2i/}} and {{IPA|/ki/}} are common. It is also triggered by labial clicks, though not by labial stops. Clicks subject to this constraint involve a sharp [[retracted tongue root|retraction]] of the tongue during release.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n! !!Abrupt <br>release!!Noisy <br>release\n|-\n|ballistic tongue retraction<br>& back-vowel constraint\n|align=center|\u01c3||align=center|\u01c1, \u0298\n|-\n|no retraction, no constraint\n|align=center|\u01c2||align=center|\u01c0\n|}\n\nMiller and colleagues (2003) used [[ultrasound imaging]] to show that the rear articulation of the alveolar clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c3]}}) in Nama is substantially different from that of palatal and dental clicks. Specifically, the shape of the body of the tongue in palatal clicks is very similar to that of the vowel {{IPA|[i]}}, and involves the same tongue muscles, so that sequences such as {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}} involved a simple and quick transition. The rear articulation of the alveolar clicks, however, is several centimetres further back, and involves a different set of muscles in the uvular region. The part of the tongue required to approach the palate for the vowel {{IPA|[i]}} is deeply retracted in {{IPA|[\u01c3]}}, as it lies at the bottom of the air pocket used to create the vacuum required for click airstream. This makes the transition required for {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} much more complex and the timing more difficult than the shallower and more forward tongue position of the palatal clicks. Consequently, {{IPA|[\u01c3i]}} takes 50 [[millisecond|ms]] longer to pronounce than {{IPA|[\u01c2i]}}, the same amount of time required to pronounce {{IPA|[\u01c3\u0259i]}}.\n\nLanguages do not all behave alike. In [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c0uu]], the simple clicks {{IPA|/\u0298, \u01c3, \u01c1/}} trigger the {{IPA|[\u0259i]}} and {{IPA|[\u00e6]}} allophones of {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, whereas {{IPA|/\u01c0, \u01c2/}} do not. All of the affricated contour clicks, such as {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}}, do as well, as do the uvular stops {{IPA|/q, \u03c7/}}. However, the occlusive contour clicks pattern like the simple clicks, and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} does not trigger the back-vowel constraint. This is because they involve tongue-root raising rather than [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|tongue-root retraction]] in the uvular-pharyngeal region. However, in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]], which is otherwise largely similar, both {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361q/}} and {{IPA|/\u01c2\u0361\u03c7/}} trigger the back-vowel constraint (Miller 2009).\n\n==Manners of articulation==\n{{main|nasal click|glottalised click|pulmonic-contour click|ejective-contour click}}\nClick manners are often called click ''accompaniments'' or ''effluxes'', but both terms have met with objections on theoretical grounds.\n\nThere is a great variety of click manners, both simplex and complex, the latter variously analysed as consonant [[consonant cluster|clusters]] or [[contour (linguistics)|contours]]. With so few click languages, and so little study of them, it is also unclear to what extent clicks in different languages are equivalent. For example, the {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Khoekhoe, {{IPA|[\u01c3k\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u02c0\u01c3k]}} of Sandawe and {{IPA|[\u014b\u030a\u01c3\u02c0 ~ \u014b\u01c3k\u02c0]}} of Hadza may be essentially the same phone; no language distinguishes them, and the differences in transcription may have more to do with the approach of the linguist than with actual differences in the sounds. Such suspected allophones/allographs are listed on a common row in the table below.\n\nSome Khoisan languages are [[Linguistic typology|typologically]] unusual in allowing mixed [[phonation|voicing]] in non-click consonant clusters/contours, such as {{IPA|dt\u0361s\u02bck\u0361x\u02bc}}, so it is not surprising that they would allow mixed voicing in clicks as well. This may be an effect of epiglottalised voiced consonants, because voicing is incompatible with epiglottalisation.\n\n===Phonation===\nAs do other consonants, clicks vary in [[phonation]]. Oral clicks are attested with four phonations: [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]], [[voiced consonant|voiced]] and [[breathy voice]]d (murmured). Nasal clicks may also vary, with plain voiced, breathy voiced / murmured nasal, aspirated and unaspirated voiceless clicks attested (the last only in Taa). The aspirated nasal clicks are often said to have 'delayed aspiration'; there is nasal airflow throughout the click, which may become voiced between vowels, though the aspiration itself is voiceless. A few languages also have pre-glottalised nasal clicks, which have very brief prenasalisation<!--creaky-voiced nasal?--> but have not been phonetically analysed to the extent that other types of clicks have.\n\nAll languages have nasal clicks, and all but [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] and [[Damin]] also have oral clicks. All languages but Damin have at least one phonation contrast as well.\n\n===Complex clicks===\nClicks may be pronounced with a third place of articulation, glottal. A [[glottal stop]] is made during the hold of the click; the (necessarily voiceless) click is released, and then the glottal hold is released into the vowel. Glottalised clicks are very common, and they are generally nasalised as well. The nasalisation cannot be heard during the click release, as there is no pulmonic airflow, and generally not at all when the click occurs at the beginning of an utterance, but it has the effect of nasalising preceding vowels, to the extent that the glottalised clicks of Sandawe and Hadza are often described as prenasalised when in medial position. Two languages, [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]], contrast plain and nasal glottalised clicks, but in languages without such a contrast, the glottalised click is nasal. Miller (2011) analyses the glottalisation as phonation, and so considers these to be simple clicks.\n\nVarious languages also have prenasalised clicks, which may be analysed as consonant sequences. [[Sotho language|Sotho]], for example, allows a syllabic nasal before its three clicks, as in ''nnqane'' 'the other side' (prenasalised nasal) and ''seqhenqha'' 'hunk'.\n\nThere is ongoing discussion as to how the distinction between what were historically described as 'velar' and 'uvular' clicks is best described. The 'uvular' clicks are only found in some languages, and have an extended pronunciation that suggests that they are more complex than the simple ('velar') clicks, which are found in all. Nakagawa (1996) describes the extended clicks in [[G\u01c0wi dialect|G\u01c0wi]] as [[consonant cluster]]s, sequences equivalent to English ''st'' or ''pl'', whereas Miller (2011) analyses similar sounds in several languages as click\u2013non-click [[contour (linguistics)|contours]], where a click transitions into a pulmonic or ejective articulation within a single segment, analogous to how English ''ch'' and ''j'' transition from occlusive to fricative but still behave as unitary sounds. With ejective clicks, for example, Miller finds that although the ejective release follows the click release, it is the rear closure of the click that is ejective, not an independently articulated consonant. That is, in a simple click, the release of the rear articulation is not audible, whereas in a contour click, the rear (uvular) articulation is audibly released after the front (click) articulation, resulting in a double release.\n\nThese contour clicks may be ''linguo-pulmonic'', that is, they may transition from a click (lingual) articulation to a normal pulmonic consonant like {{IPAblink|q}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q]}}); or ''linguo-glottalic'' and transition from lingual to an ejective consonant like {{IPAblink|q\u02bc}} (e.g. {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361q\u02bc]}}): that is, a sequence of ingressive (lingual) release + egressive (pulmonic or glottalic) release. In some cases there is a shift in place of articulation as well, and instead of a uvular release, the uvular click transitions to a velar or [[Epiglottal consonant|epigottal]] release (depending on the description, {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} or {{IPA|[\u01c2\u1d34]}}). Although [[homorganic]] {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361\u03c7\u02bc]}} does not contrast with heterorganic {{IPA|[\u01c2\u0361kx\u02bc]}} in any known language, they are phonetically quite distinct (Miller 2011).\n\nApart from Dahalo, Damin and many of the Bantu languages (Yeyi and Xhosa being exceptions), 'click' languages have glottalised clicks. Contour clicks are restricted to southern Africa, but are very common there: they are found in all members of the Tuu, Kx'a and Khoe families, as well as in the Bantu language Yeyi.\n\n===Variation among languages===\nIn a comparative study of clicks across various languages, using her own field work as well as phonetic descriptions and data by other field researchers, Miller (2011) posits 21 types of clicks that contrast in manner or airstream.<ref group=note>Not counting the egressive \"spurt\" in Damin, and tree additional voiced manners in Western !Xoo, which pair up with voiceless manners.</ref> The [[homorganic]] and heterorganic affricated ejective clicks do not contrast in any known language, but are judged dissimilar enough to keep separate. Miller's conclusions differ from those of the primary researcher of a language; see the individual languages for details.\n* [[Taa language|Taa]] (\u01c3X\u00f3\u00f5) and [[N\u01c1ng language|N\u01c1ng]] (N\u01c0uu) are [[Tuu languages]], from the two branches of that family.\n* [[\u01c2Hoan language|\u01c2Hoan]] and [[Ju\u01c0\u02bchoan language|Ju\u01c0\u02bch\u00f5asi]] are [[Kx'a languages]], from the two branches of that family.\n* [[Korana language|Korana]] and [[G\u01c0wi language|G\u01c0ui]] (G\u01c1ana) are [[Khoe languages]], from the two branches of that family.\n(all spoken primarily in [[South Africa]], [[Namibia]] and [[Botswana]]; [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]] is like Korana except it has lost ejective {{IPA|/\u01c3\u0361\u03c7\u02bc/}})\n* [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] are [[language isolate]]s spoken in [[Tanzania]]\n* [[Dahalo language|Dahalo]] is a [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] language of [[Kenya]]\n* [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] and [[Yeyi language|Yeyi]] are [[Bantu languages]], from the two geographic areas of that family that have acquired clicks.\n([[Zulu language|Zulu]] is like Xhosa apart from not having {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c3\u02c0/}})\n* [[Damin]] was an initiation jargon in northern [[Australia]].\n\nEach language below is illustrated with alveolar clicks, apart from Dahalo, which only has dental.

The original researchers believe that {{IPA|[\u01c3\u02b0]}} and {{IPA|[\u01c3\u03c7]}} are allophones.\n\nA DoBeS (2008) study of the Western !Xoo dialect of Taa found several new manners: creaky voiced (the voiced equivalent of glottalised oral), breathy-voiced nasal, prenasalised \u0261lottalised (the voiced equivalent of glottalised) and a (pre)voiced ejective. These extra voiced clicks reflect Western !Xoo morphology, where many nouns form their plural by voicing their initial consonant. DoBeS analyses most Taa clicks as clusters, leaving nine basic manners (marked with asterisks in the table). This comes close to Miller's distinction between simple and contour clicks, shaded light and medium grey in the table.\n\n==Click genesis and click loss==\nClicks are often portrayed{{weasel-inline|date=August 2018}} as a primordial feature of human language, a romantic reflection of the primordial lifestyle imagined of the speakers of Khoisan languages. One genetic study concluded that clicks, which occur in the languages of the genetically divergent populations Hadza and !Kung, may be an ancient element of human language.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tishkoff |first=S. A. |last2=Gonder |first2=M. K. |last3=Henn |first3=B. M. |last4=Mortensen |first4=H. |last5=Knight |first5=A. |last6=Gignoux |first6=C. |last7=Fernandopulle |first7=N. |displayauthors=3 |year=2007 |title=History of click-speaking populations of Africa inferred from mtDNA and Y chromosome genetic variation |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=2180\u201395 |doi=10.1093/molbev/msm155 }}</ref> However, this conclusion relies on several dubious assumptions (see [[Hadza language]]), and most linguists assume that clicks, being quite complex consonants, arose relatively late in human history. How they arose is not known, but it is generally assumed that they developed from sequences of non-click consonants, as they are found allophonically for [[doubly articulated consonant]]s in West Africa (Ladefoged 1968), where {{IPA|/tk/}} sequences overlap at word boundaries in German<ref name=germ />, and for the sequence {{IPA|/mw/}} in [[Ndau language|Ndau]] and [[Tonga language (Zambia)|Tonga]].<ref group=note>Here the labial {{IPA|[m]}} may have assimilated to the velar place of the {{IPA|[w]}}, as {{IPA|[m\u0361\u014bw]}}, with the release of the labial before the velar later generating a click {{IPA|[\u1d50\u0298w]}}</ref> Such developments have also been posited in historical reconstruction. For example, the [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] word for 'horn', {{IPA|/t\u026cana/}}, with a lateral affricate, may be a cognate with the root {{IPA|/\u1d51\u01c1a\u02d0/}} found throughout the [[Khoe languages|Khoe family]], which has a lateral click. This and other words suggests that at least some Khoe clicks may have formed from consonant clusters when the first vowel of a word was lost; in this instance *{{IPA|[t\u026cana]}} > *{{IPA|[t\u026cna]}} > {{IPA|[\u01c1\u014ba] ~ [\u1d51\u01c1a]}}.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, several non-endangered languages in vigorous use demonstrate click loss. For example, the [[Khoe languages|East Kalahari languages]] have lost clicks from a large percentage of their vocabulary, presumably due to [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] influence. As a rule, a click is replaced by a consonant with close to the [[manner of articulation]] of the click and the [[place of articulation]] of the forward release: alveolar click releases (the {{IPA|[\u01c3]}} family) tend to mutate into a velar stop or affricate, such as {{IPA|[k], [\u0261], [\u014b], [k\u0361x]}}; palatal clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c2]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into a palatal stop such as {{IPA|[c], [&thinsp;\u025f], [&thinsp;\u0272], [c\u02bc]}}, or a post-alveolar affricate {{IPA|[t\u0283], [d\u0292]}}; and dental clicks ({{IPA|[\u01c0]}} ''etc.'') tend to mutate into an alveolar affricate {{IPA|[ts]}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\n==Difficulty==\nClicks are often presented as difficult sounds to articulate within words.

The story,  set in the pre- and post-World War II era, is about a young man, Homer Wells, growing up under the guidance of Dr. Wilbur Larch, an obstetrician and abortionist. The story relates his early life at Larch's orphanage in Maine and follows Homer as he eventually leaves the nest and [[Coming of age|comes of age]] in the world.\n\n==Background==\nThe story about Wally being shot down over Burma was based in part on that of Irving's biological father (whom he never met), who had been shot down over Burma and survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/books/novelist-builds-fact-reach-truth-john-irving-begins-with-his-memories.html?scp=28&sq=&st=nyt&pagewanted=all|title=A Novelist Builds Out From Fact To Reach The Truth; John Irving Begins With His Memories|date=1998-04-28|author=Mel Gussow|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-11-07}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nHomer Wells grows up in an [[orphan]]age where he spends his childhood trying to be \"of use\" as a medical assistant to the director, Dr. Wilbur Larch, whose history is told in [[flashback (continuity)|flashbacks]]: After a traumatic misadventure with a [[prostitute]] as a young man, Wilbur turns his back on sex and love, choosing instead to help women with unwanted pregnancies give birth and then keeping the babies in an orphanage. He makes a point of maintaining an emotional distance from the orphans, so that they can more easily make the transition into an adoptive family, but when it becomes clear that Homer is going to spend his entire childhood at the orphanage, Wilbur trains the orphan as an [[obstetrician]] and then comes to love him like a son.\n\nWilbur's and Homer's lives are complicated by Wilbur also secretly being an [[abortion]]ist. Wilbur came to this work reluctantly, but he is driven by having seen the horrors of back-alley operations. Homer, upon learning Wilbur's secret, considers it morally wrong.\n\nAs a young man, Homer befriends a young couple, Candy Kendall and Wally Worthington, who come to St. Cloud's for an abortion. Homer leaves the orphanage, and returns with them to Ocean View Orchards (Wally's family's orchard) in Heart's Rock, near the Maine coast. Wally and Homer become best friends and Homer develops a secret love for Candy. Wally goes off to serve in the [[World War II|Second World War]] and his plane is shot down over [[Burma]]. He is presumed missing by the military, but Homer and Candy both believe he is dead and move on with their lives, which includes beginning a romantic relationship. When Candy becomes pregnant, they go back to St. Cloud's Orphanage, where their son is born and named Angel.\n\nSubsequently, Wally is found in Burma and returns home, paralyzed from the waist down. He is still able to have sexual intercourse but is sterile due to an infection caught in Burma. They lie to the family about Angel's parentage, claiming that Homer decided to adopt him. Wally and Candy marry shortly afterward, but Candy and Homer maintain a secret affair that lasts some 15 years.\n\nMany years later, teenaged Angel falls in love with Rose. Rose, the daughter of the head [[migrant worker]] at the apple orchard, becomes pregnant by her father, and Homer performs an abortion on her. Homer decides to return to the orphanage after the death of Wilbur, to work as the new director. Though he maintains his distaste for abortions, he continues Dr. Larch's legacy of honoring the choice of his patients, and he dreams of the day when abortions are free, legal, and safe, so he'll no longer feel obliged to offer them.\n\nThe name \"The Cider House Rules\" refers to the list of rules that the migrant workers are supposed to follow at the Ocean View Orchards. However, none of them can read, and they are completely unaware of the rules - which have been posted for years.\n\nA subplot follows the character Melony, who grew up alongside Homer in the orphanage. She was Homer's first girlfriend in a relationship of circumstances. After Homer leaves the orphanage, so does she in an effort to find him. She eventually becomes an electrician and takes a female lover, Lorna. Melony is an extremely stoic woman, who refuses to press charges against a man who brutally broke her nose and arm so that she can later take revenge herself. She is the catalyst that transforms Homer from his comfortable but not entirely admirable position at the apple orchard to becoming Dr. Larch's replacement at the orphanage.\n\n==References==\n<references></references>\n{{John Irving}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cider House Rules}}\n[[Category:1985 American novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by John Irving]]\n[[Category:Novels about abortion]]\n[[Category:American novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Maine]]\n[[Category:William Morrow and Company books]]\n[[Category:Novels about orphans]]", "sha1": "1fa2kxto3ouwz14x9ey36znv8tflbgy"}}, {"title": "Consumer", "ns": "0", "id": "7818", "revision": {"id": "862533032", "parentid": "862532397", "timestamp": "2018-10-05T00:44:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mojo Hand", "id": "1453997"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/47.205.176.140|47.205.176.140]] ([[User talk:47.205.176.140|talk]]) to last version by ClueBot NG", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|consumers in social systems|Consumers in science|Consumers (food chain)}}\n{{Other uses}}\n[[File:People are buying fruits.jpg|thumb|Consumers buying fruit in [[Nanjing]], China]]\nA '''consumer''' is a person or organization that use [[Service (economics)|economic services]] or [[Commodity|commodities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/consumer|title=Consumer - Define Consumer at Dictionary.com|work=Dictionary.com}}</ref>\n\n==Economics and marketing==\nThe consumer is the one who pays something to consume [[goods and services]] produced.

Most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the [[Atacama Desert]], one of the driest places on earth. Cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. Almost all cacti are [[succulent]]s, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water. Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]], which are highly modified leaves. As well as defending against [[herbivore]]s, spines help prevent water loss by reducing air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. In the absence of leaves, enlarged [[Plant stem|stems]] carry out [[photosynthesis]]. Cacti are native to the Americas, ranging from [[Patagonia]] in the south to parts of western [[Canada]] in the north\u2014except for ''[[Rhipsalis baccifera]]'', which also grows in [[Africa]] and [[Sri Lanka]].\n\nCactus spines are produced from specialized structures called [[areole]]s, a kind of highly reduced branch. [[Areoles]] are an identifying feature of cacti. As well as spines, areoles give rise to [[flower]]s, which are usually tubular and multipetaled. Many cacti have  short [[growing season]]s and long dormancies, and are able to react quickly to any rainfall, helped by an extensive but relatively shallow root system that quickly absorbs any water reaching the ground surface. Cactus stems are often ribbed or fluted, which allows them to expand and contract easily for quick water absorption after rain, followed by long [[drought]] periods. Like other succulent plants, most cacti employ a special mechanism called \"[[crassulacean acid metabolism]]\" (CAM) as part of photosynthesis. [[Transpiration]], during which [[carbon dioxide]] enters the plant and water escapes, does not take place during the day at the same time as photosynthesis, but instead occurs at night. The plant stores the carbon dioxide it takes in as [[malic acid]], retaining it until daylight returns, and only then using it in photosynthesis. Because transpiration takes place during the cooler, more humid night hours, water loss is significantly reduced.\n\nMany smaller cacti have globe-shaped stems, combining the highest possible volume for water storage, with the lowest possible surface area for water loss from [[transpiration]]. The tallest<ref group=Note>The tallest living cactus is a specimen of ''[[Pachycereus pringlei]]''. The tallest cactus ever measured was an armless [[saguaro]] cactus which blew over in a windstorm in July 1986; it was {{convert|78|ft|m}} tall.{{cite news |title=Windstorm Fells 78-Foot Cactus--Tallest in World |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-01/news/mn-19025_1_world-s-tallest-cactus |accessdate=2015-08-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029141504/http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-01/news/mn-19025_1_world-s-tallest-cactus |archivedate=2015-10-29 |df= }}</ref> free-standing cactus is ''[[Pachycereus pringlei]]'', with a maximum recorded height of {{convert|19.2|m|ft|abbr=on}},<ref name=Sala00/> and the smallest is ''[[Blossfeldia liliputiana]]'', only about {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} in diameter at maturity.<ref name=mauseth/> A fully grown saguaro (''[[Carnegiea gigantea]]'') is said to be able to absorb as much as {{convert|200|USgal|l impgal|sp=us}} of water during a rainstorm.<ref name=nps/> A few species differ significantly in appearance from most of the family. At least superficially, plants of the genus ''[[Pereskia]]'' resemble other trees and shrubs growing around them. They have persistent leaves, and when older, bark-covered stems. Their areoles identify them as cacti, and in spite of their appearance, they, too, have many adaptations for water conservation. ''Pereskia'' is considered close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved. In tropical regions, other cacti grow as forest climbers and [[epiphyte]]s (plants that grow on trees). Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines, such as the well-known Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus (in the genus ''[[Schlumbergera]]'').\n\nCacti have a variety of uses: many species are used as ornamental plants, others are grown for fodder or forage, and others for food (particularly their fruit). [[Carmine|Cochineal]] is the product of an insect that lives on some cacti.\n\nMany [[succulent plant]]s in both the [[Old World|Old]] and [[New World]] \u2013 such as some [[Euphorbiaceae]] (euphorbias) \u2013 bear a striking resemblance to cacti, and may incorrectly be called \"cactus\" in common usage.\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Barrel cactus with a view.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[Ferocactus]]'' species, a cactoid, in its native [[Arizona]] habitat]]\nThe 1,500 to 1,800 species of cacti mostly fall into one of two groups of \"core cacti\": opuntias (subfamily [[Opuntioideae]]) and \"cactoids\" (subfamily Cactoideae). Most members of these two groups are easily recognizable as cacti. They have fleshy [[Succulent plant|succulent]] [[Plant stem|stems]] that are major [[Organ (biology)|organs]] of [[photosynthesis]]. They have absent, small, or transient [[Leaf|leaves]]. They have [[flowers]] with [[Ovary (plants)|ovaries]] that lie below the [[sepals]] and [[petals]], often deeply sunken into a fleshy [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] (the part of the stem from which the flower parts grow). All cacti have [[areole]]s\u2014highly specialized short shoots with extremely short [[Internode (botany)|internodes]] that produce [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|spines]], normal shoots, and flowers.<ref name=EdwaDono06/>\n\nThe remaining cacti fall into only two genera, ''[[Pereskia]]'' and ''[[Maihuenia]]'', and are rather different,<ref name=EdwaDono06/> which means any description of cacti as a whole must frequently make exceptions for them. ''Pereskia'' species superficially resemble other tropical forest trees. When mature, they have woody stems that may be covered with [[Bark (botany)|bark]] and long-lasting leaves that provide the main means of photosynthesis. Their flowers may have superior ovaries (i.e., above the points of attachment of the sepals and petals), and areoles that produce further leaves. The two species of ''Maihuenia'' have small, globe-shaped bodies with prominent leaves at the top.<ref name=EdwaDono06/>\n\n===Growth habit===\n\nCacti show a wide variety of growth [[habit (biology)|habits]], which are difficult to divide into clear, simple categories. \n\n; {{vanchor|Arborescent cacti}}\nThey can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody [[Trunk (botany)|trunk]] topped by several to many [[branch]]es. In the genus ''[[Pereskia]]'', the branches are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare of leaves and bark, and covered with spines, as in ''[[Pachycereus pringlei]]'' or the larger [[opuntia]]s. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of ''[[Echinocactus platyacanthus]]''. Cacti may also be described as [[shrub]]by, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in ''[[Stenocereus thurberi]]''.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n; {{vanchor|Columnar cacti}}\nSmaller cacti may be described as columnar. They consist of erect, cylinder-shaped stems, which may or may not branch, without a very clear division into trunk and branches. The boundary between columnar forms and tree-like or shrubby forms is difficult to define. Smaller and younger specimens of ''[[Cephalocereus senilis]]'', for example, are columnar, whereas older and larger specimens may become tree-like. In some cases, the \"columns\" may be horizontal rather than vertical. Thus, ''[[Stenocereus eruca]]'' has stems growing along the ground, rooting at intervals.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n; {{vanchor|Globular cacti}}\nCacti whose stems are even smaller may be described as globular (or globose). They consist of shorter, more ball-shaped stems than columnar cacti. Globular cacti may be solitary, such as ''[[Ferocactus latispinus]]'', or their stems may form clusters that can create large mounds. All or some stems in a cluster may share a common root.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n; Other forms\nOther cacti have a quite different appearance. In tropical regions, some grow as forest climbers and [[epiphyte]]s. Their stems are typically flattened, almost leaf-like in appearance, with fewer or even no spines. Climbing cacti can be very large; a specimen of ''[[Hylocereus]]'' was reported as {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}} long from root to the most distant stem. Epiphytic cacti, such as species of ''[[Rhipsalis]]'' or ''[[Schlumbergera]]'', often hang downwards, forming dense clumps where they grow in trees high above the ground.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n{{center|'''Growth habits of cacti'''}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=155 style=\"font-size:95%; line-height:120%\">\nCardon Pachycereus pringlei.jpg|Tall treelike habit (''[[Pachycereus pringlei]]'')\nCephalocereus columna-trajani rev.jpg|Tall unbranched columnar habit (''[[Cephalocereus]]'')\nFerocactus1.jpg|Shorter clustered columnar habit (''[[Ferocactus pilosus]]'')\nFerocactus echidne var victoriensis 1.jpg|Solitary globular habit (''[[Ferocactus echidne]]'')\nRebutia flavistylus 2 rev.jpg|Clustered globular habit (''[[Rebutia]]'' species)<!--image info implies R. flavistyla, but Anderson p.603 says \"usually solitary\"-->\nRhipsalis paradoxa.jpg|Epiphytic cactus (''[[Rhipsalis paradoxa]]'')\nPereskia aculeata5.jpg|Treelike habit (''[[Pereskia aculeata]]'')\n</gallery>\n\n===Stems===\n[[File:Succu Mammillaria longimamma 02.jpg|thumb|Stem of ''[[Mammillaria longimamma]]'', showing tubercles]]\nThe leafless, spiny stem is the characteristic feature of the majority of cacti (and all of those belonging to the largest subfamily, the Cactoideae). The stem is typically succulent, meaning it is adapted to store water. The surface of the stem may be smooth (as in some species of ''Opuntia'') or covered with protuberances of various kinds, which are usually called tubercles. These vary from small \"bumps\" to prominent, nipple-like shapes in the genus ''[[Mammillaria]]'' and outgrowths almost like leaves in ''[[Ariocarpus]]'' species. The stem may also be ribbed or fluted in shape. The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing: when full (up to 90% of the mass of a cactus may be water), the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem, whereas when the cactus is short of water and the stems shrink, the ribs may be very visible.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\nThe stems of most cacti are some shade of green, often bluish or brownish green. Such stems contain [[chlorophyll]] and are able to carry out photosynthesis; they also have [[Stoma (botany)|stomata]] (small structures that can open and close to allow passage of gases). Cactus stems are often visibly waxy.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n===Areoles===\n\n{{multiple image\n|title=Cactus areoles\n|total_width=400|perrow = 2 / 3\n|width1=1328|height1= 990|image1=Pereskia grandifolia areole.jpg\n|caption1=Areole of ''[[Pereskia grandifolia]]'' showing its position relative to leaves\n|width2=4408|height2=3229|image2=Cut Cereus (brightened).jpg\n|caption2=Cross-section of ''[[Cereus (plant)|Cereus]]'' showing areoles with spines and wool\n\n|width3=2736|height3=3648|image3=Echinopsis candicans (3).jpg\n|caption3=Areoles of an ''[[Echinopsis]]'' species\n|width4= 528|height4= 552|image4=Astrophytum capricorne areole.jpg\n|caption4=Close-up of an areole of ''[[Astrophytum capricorne]]'' showing fine wool\n|width5= 725|height5= 492|image5=Cactus 4a - geograph.org.uk - 1446436 cleaned.jpg\n|caption5=Flowers appear from the upper part of an areole, spines from the lower (''Cereus'' species)\n}}\n\n[[Areole]]s are structures unique to cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy areas on the stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus ''[[Pereskia]]'', believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem).{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=566}} In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.\n\nAreoles are highly specialized and very condensed shoots or branches. In a normal shoot, [[Plant stem|nodes]] bearing leaves or flowers would be separated by lengths of stem (internodes). In an areole, the nodes are so close together, they form a single structure. The areole may be circular, elongated into an oval shape, or even separated into two parts; the two parts may be visibly connected in some way (e.g. by a groove in the stem) or appear entirely separate (a dimorphic areole). The part nearer the top of the stem then produces flowers, the other part spines. Areoles often have multicellular hairs ([[trichome]]s) that give the areole a hairy or woolly appearance, sometimes of a distinct color such as yellow or brown.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\nIn most cacti, the areoles produce new spines or flowers only for a few years, and then become inactive. This results in a relatively fixed number of spines, with flowers being produced only from the ends of stems, which are still growing and forming new areoles. In ''Pereskia'',  a genus close to the ancestor of cacti, areoles remain active for much longer; this is also the case in ''[[Opuntia]]'' and ''[[Neoraimondia]]''.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n===Leaves===\n\nThe great majority of cacti have no visible [[leaf|leaves]]; photosynthesis takes place in the stems (which may be flattened and leaflike in some species). Exceptions occur in three groups of cacti. All the species of ''[[Pereskia]]'' are superficially like normal trees or shrubs and have numerous leaves.  Many cacti in the opuntia group (subfamily [[Opuntioideae]], opuntioids) also have visible leaves, which may be long-lasting (as in ''[[Pereskiopsis]]'' species) or be produced only during the growing season and then be lost (as in many species of ''[[Opuntia]]'').{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}} The small genus ''[[Maihuenia]]'' also relies on leaves for photosynthesis.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=398}} The structure of the leaves varies somewhat between these groups. ''Pereskia'' species have \"normal\" leaves, with a midrib and a flattened blade (lamina) on either side. Opuntioids and ''Maihuenia'' have leaves that appear to consist only of a midrib.{{sfnp|ps=none|Mauseth|2007|p=845}}\n\nEven those cacti without visible photosynthetic leaves do usually have very small leaves, less than {{convert|0.5|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} long in about half of the species studied and almost always less than {{convert|1.5|mm|in|abbr=on|2}} long. The function of such leaves cannot be photosynthesis; a role in the production of plant hormones, such as [[auxin]], and in defining [[axillary bud]]s has been suggested.<ref name=Maus07/>\n\n===Spines===\n<!--{{multiple image|perrow=2\n|title=Cactus spines\n|total_width=300\n|width1=600|height1=535|image1=Ferocactus1001.jpg\n|caption1=Varied spines of a ''[[Ferocactus]]''\n|width2=1602|height2=2400|image2=Hakendornen IMGP7026 WP.jpg\n|caption2=Hooked central spine (cf.

Cacti produce spines, always from areoles as noted above. Spines are present even in those cacti with leaves, such as ''Pereskia'', ''[[Pereskiopsis]]'' and ''Maihuenia'', so they clearly evolved before complete leaflessness. Some cacti only have spines when young, possibly only when seedlings. This is particularly true of tree-living cacti, such as ''[[Rhipsalis]]'' or ''[[Schlumbergera]]'', but some ground-living cacti, such as ''[[Ariocarpus]]'', also lack spines when mature.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\nThe spines of cacti are often useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, as well as in whether all the spines produced by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, needle-like or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. ''[[Schlerocactus papyracanthus]]''). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., ''[[Mammillaria rekoi]]'').{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\nIn addition to normal-length spines, members of the subfamily Opuntioideae have relatively short spines, called [[glochid]]s, that are barbed along their length and easily shed. These enter the skin and are difficult to remove, causing long-lasting irritation.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n{{center|'''Cactus spines'''}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=160 style=\"font-size:95%; line-height:120%\">\nFerocactus1001.jpg|Varied spines of a ''[[Ferocactus]]''\nHakendornen IMGP7026 WP.jpg|Hooked central spine (cf.

Some cacti have [[taproot]]s; in genera such as ''[[Copiapoa]]'', these are considerably larger and of a greater volume than the body. Taproots may aid in stabilizing the larger columnar cacti.<ref name=dalhousie/> Climbing, creeping and epiphytic cacti may have only [[Root#Specialized roots|adventitious roots]], produced along the stems where these come into contact with a rooting medium.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n===Flowers===\n[[File:Echinopsis multiplex cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Large flowers of an ''[[Echinopsis]]'']]\n[[File:Stamen of Fish hook Cactus.jpg|thumb|Style and stamens of ''[[Mammillaria beneckei]]'' flower]]\nLike their spines, cactus [[flower]]s are variable. Typically, the ovary is surrounded by material derived from stem or [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]] tissue, forming a structure called a [[Hypanthium|pericarpel]]. Tissue derived from the petals and sepals continues the pericarpel, forming a composite tube\u2014the whole may be called a floral tube, although strictly speaking only the part furthest from the base is floral in origin. The outside of the tubular structure often has areoles that produce wool and spines. Typically, the tube also has small scale-like [[bract]]s, which gradually change into sepal-like and then petal-like structures, so the sepals and petals cannot be clearly differentiated (and hence are often called \"[[tepal]]s\").{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}} Some cacti produce floral tubes without wool or spines (e.g. ''[[Gymnocalycium]]''){{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=347\u2013348}} or completely devoid of any external structures (e.g. ''[[Mammillaria]]'').{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}} Unlike the flowers of other cacti, ''Pereskia'' flowers may be borne in clusters.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=566}}\n\nCactus flowers usually have many [[stamen]]s, but only a single [[Gynoecium|style]], which may branch at the end into more than one [[Stigma (botany)|stigma]]. The stamens usually arise from all over the inner surface of the upper part of the floral tube, although in some cacti, the stamens are produced in one or more distinct \"series\" in more specific areas of the inside of the floral tube.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\nThe flower as a whole is usually radially symmetrical ([[Floral symmetry#Actinomorphic|actinomorphic]]), but may be bilaterally symmetrical ([[Floral symmetry#Zygomorphic|zygomorphic]]) in some species. Flower colors range from white through yellow and red to magenta.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n==Adaptations for water conservation==\n{{anchor|Adaptations to dry environment}} <!-- old heading, may still be linked -->\n\nAll cacti have some adaptations to promote efficient water use. Most cacti\u2014opuntias and cactoids\u2014specialize in surviving in hot and dry environments (i.e. they are [[xerophytes]]), but the first ancestors of modern cacti were already adapted to periods of intermittent drought.<ref name=EdwaDono06/> A small number of cactus species in the tribes [[Hylocereeae]] and [[Rhipsalideae]] have become adapted to life as climbers or [[epiphyte]]s, often in tropical forests, where water conservation is less important.\n\n===Leaves and spines===\n\nThe absence of visible leaves is one of the most striking features of most cacti.  ''[[Pereskia]]'' (which is close to the ancestral species from which all cacti evolved) does have long-lasting leaves, which are, however, thickened and [[Succulent plant|succulent]] in many species.<ref name=EdwaDono06/>  Other species of cactus with long-lasting leaves, such as the opuntioid ''[[Pereskiopsis]]'', also have succulent leaves.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=572}} A key issue in retaining water is the ratio of surface area to volume. Water loss is proportional to surface area, whereas the amount of water present is proportional to volume. Structures with a high surface area-to-volume ratio, such as thin leaves, necessarily lose water at a higher rate than structures with a low area-to-volume ratio, such as thickened stems.\n\n[[Thorns, spines, and prickles|Spines]], which are modified leaves, are present on even those cacti with true leaves, showing the evolution of spines preceded the loss of leaves. Although spines have a high surface area-to-volume ratio, at maturity they contain little or no water, being composed of fibers made up of dead cells.{{sfnp|ps=none|Mauseth|2007|p=845}} Spines provide protection from [[herbivore]]s and camouflage in some species, and assist in water conservation in several ways. They trap air near the surface of the cactus, creating a moister layer that reduces evaporation and [[transpiration]]. They can provide some shade, which lowers the temperature of the surface of the cactus, also reducing water loss. When sufficiently moist air is present, such as during fog or early morning mist, spines can condense moisture, which then drips onto the ground and is absorbed by the roots.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\n===Stems===\n[[File:Starr 030202-0037 Cereus uruguayanus.jpg|thumb|Stem of young ''[[Cereus hildmannianus]]'' subsp. ''uruguayanus'', showing ribbing and waxy coating]]\n\nThe majority of cacti are [[stem succulent]]s, i.e., plants in which the stem is the main organ used to store water. Water may form up to 90% of the total mass of a cactus. Stem shapes vary considerably among cacti. The cylindrical shape of columnar cacti and the spherical shape of globular cacti produce a low surface area-to-volume ratio, thus reducing water loss, as well as minimizing the heating effects of sunlight. The ribbed or fluted stems of many cacti allow the stem to shrink during periods of drought and then swell as it fills with water during periods of availability.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}} A mature saguaro (''[[Carnegiea gigantea]]'') is said to be able to absorb as much as {{convert|200|USgal|l impgal|sp=us}} of water during a rainstorm.<ref name=nps/> The outer layer of the stem usually has a tough [[Plant cuticle|cuticle]], reinforced with waxy layers, which reduce water loss. These layers are responsible for the grayish or bluish tinge to the stem color of many cacti.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\nThe stems of most cacti have adaptations to allow them to conduct photosynthesis in the absence of leaves. This is discussed further below under [[#Metabolism|Metabolism]].\n\n===Roots===\n\nMany cacti have roots that spread out widely, but only penetrate a short distance into the soil. In one case, a young saguaro only {{convert|12|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall had a root system with a diameter of {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on|0}}, but no more than {{convert|10|cm|in|abbr=on|0}} deep.<ref name=dalhousie/> Cacti can also form new roots quickly when rain falls after a drought. The concentration of salts in the root cells of cacti is relatively high.<ref name=GibsNobe90/> All these adaptations enable cacti to absorb water rapidly during periods of brief or light rainfall. Thus, ''[[Ferocactus cylindraceus]]'' reportedly can take up a significant amount of water within 12 hours of as little as {{convert|7|mm|in|abbr=on|1}} of rainfall, becoming fully hydrated in a few days.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}}\n\nAlthough in most cacti, the stem acts as the main organ for storing water, some cacti have in addition large taproots.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}} These may be several times the length of the above-ground body in the case of species such as ''[[Copiapoa atacamensis]]'',{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=15\u201337}} which grows in one of the driest places in the world, the [[Atacama Desert]] in northern Chile.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=174}}\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|width = 260\n|header = Schematic illustration of CAM\n|image1 = CAM_schema_night.svg\n|alt1 =\n|caption1 = '''Night''': stomata open; {{CO2}} enters and is stored as malic acid; water vapor is able to escape.\n|image2 = CAM_schema_day_cropped.svg\n|alt2 =\n|caption2 = '''Day''': stomata close; malic acid is converted back to {{CO2}} and used to make carbohydrate; water vapor is confined.\n}}\n\n===Metabolism===\n[[Photosynthesis]] requires plants to take in carbon dioxide gas ({{CO2}}). As they do so, they lose water through [[transpiration]]. Like other types of [[Succulent plant|succulents]], cacti reduce this water loss by the way in which they carry out photosynthesis. \"Normal\" leafy plants use the [[C3 carbon fixation|C<sub>3</sub> mechanism]]: during daylight hours, {{CO2}} is continually drawn out of the air present in spaces inside leaves and converted first into a compound containing three carbon atoms ([[3-phosphoglycerate]]) and then into products such as [[carbohydrate]]s. The access of air to internal spaces within a plant is controlled by [[stoma]]ta, which are able to open and close. The need for a continuous supply of {{CO2}} during photosynthesis means the stomata must be open, so water vapor is continuously being lost. Plants using the C<sub>3</sub> mechanism lose as much as 97% of the water taken up through their roots in this way.<ref name=RaveEdwa01/> A further problem is that as temperatures rise, the [[enzyme]] that captures {{CO2}} starts to capture more and more oxygen instead, reducing the efficiency of photosynthesis by up to 25%.<ref name=Shar88/>\n\n[[Crassulacean acid metabolism]] (CAM) is a mechanism adopted by cacti and other succulents to avoid the problems of the  C<sub>3</sub> mechanism. In full CAM, the stomata open only at night, when temperatures and water loss are lowest. {{CO2}} enters the plant and is captured in the form of organic acids stored inside cells (in [[vacuole]]s). The stomata remain closed throughout the day, and photosynthesis uses only this stored {{CO2}}. CAM uses water much more efficiently at the price of limiting the amount of carbon fixed from the atmosphere and thus available for growth.<ref name=KeelRund03/> CAM-cycling is a less efficient system whereby stomata open in the day, just as in plants using the C<sub>3</sub> mechanism. At night, or when the plant is short of water, the stomata close and the CAM mechanism is used to store {{CO2}} produced by [[Cellular respiration|respiration]] for use later in photosynthesis. CAM-cycling is present in ''Pereskia'' species.<ref name=EdwaDono06/>\n\nBy studying the ratio of <sup>14</sup>C to <sup>13</sup>C incorporated into a plant\u2014its [[isotopic signature]]\u2014it is possible to deduce how much {{CO2}} is taken up at night and how much in the daytime. Using this approach, most of the ''Pereskia'' species investigated exhibit some degree of CAM-cycling, suggesting this ability was present in the ancestor of all cacti.<ref name=EdwaDono06/> ''Pereskia'' leaves are claimed to only have the  C<sub>3</sub> mechanism with CAM restricted to stems.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=37}} More recent studies show that \"it is highly unlikely that significant carbon assimilation occurs in the stem\"; ''Pereskia'' species are described as having \"C<sub>3</sub> with inducible CAM.\"<ref name=EdwaDono06/> Leafless cacti carry out all their photosynthesis in the stem, using full CAM. {{As of|2012|February}}, it is not clear whether stem-based CAM evolved once only in the core cacti, or separately in the opuntias and cactoids;<ref name=EdwaDono06/> CAM is known to have [[convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] many times.<ref name=KeelRund03/>\n\nTo carry out photosynthesis, cactus stems have undergone many adaptations. Early in their evolutionary history, the ancestors of modern cacti (other than one group of ''Pereskia'' species) developed [[stoma]]ta on their stems and began to delay developing bark. However, this alone was not sufficient; cacti with only these adaptations appear to do very little photosynthesis in their stems. Stems needed to develop structures similar to those normally found only in leaves. Immediately below the outer epidermis, a hypodermal layer developed made up of cells with thickened walls, offering mechanical support. Air spaces were needed between the cells to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse inwards. The center of the stem, the cortex, developed \"[[Ground tissue|chlorenchyma]]\" \u2013 a plant tissue made up of relatively unspecialized cells containing [[chloroplast]]s, arranged into a \"spongy layer\" and a \"[[Palisade cell|palisade layer]]\" where most of the photosynthesis occurs.{{sfnp|ps=none|Edwards|Nyffeler|Donoghue|2005|p=1184}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Taxonomy and classification==\n{{multiple image\n|direction = vertical\n|image1 = Botany Bay - Cynara cardunculus 1.jpg\n|image2 = Melocactus.JPG\n|footer = (Above) The spiny heads of the [[cardoon]], possibly once known as \"cactus\"; <br>(below) A ''[[Melocactus]]'', likely the first genus seen by Europeans\n}}\nNaming and classifying cacti has been both difficult and controversial since the first cacti were discovered for science. The difficulties began with [[Carl Linnaeus]]. In 1737, he placed the cacti he knew into two genera, ''Cactus'' and ''Pereskia''. However, when he published ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753\u2014the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature\u2014he relegated them all to one genus, ''Cactus''. The word \"cactus\" is derived through Latin from the [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03ba\u03ac\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2}} (''kaktos''), a name used by [[Theophrastus]] for a spiny plant,<ref name=JohnSmit72/> which may have been the [[cardoon]] (''Cynara cardunculus'').<ref name=SonnPignHamm07/>\n\nLater botanists, such as [[Philip Miller]] in 1754, divided cacti into several genera, which, in 1789, [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name ''Cactus'' had become so confused as to its meaning (was it the genus or the family?) that it should not be used as a genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name ''Cactus'' and instead declared ''Mammillaria'' was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, [[Conserved name|conserve]] the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=96}}\n\nThe difficulties continued, partly because giving plants scientific names relies on \"[[type (biology)|type specimens]]\". Ultimately, if botanists want to know whether a particular plant is an example of, say, ''Mammillaria mammillaris'', they should be able to compare it with the type specimen to which this name is permanently attached.  Type specimens are normally prepared by compression and drying, after which they are stored in [[herbarium|herbaria]] to act as definitive references. However, cacti are very difficult to preserve in this way; they have evolved to resist drying and their bodies do not easily compress.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=93\u201394}} A further difficulty is that many cacti were given names by growers and horticulturalists rather than botanists; as a result, the provisions of the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (which governs the names of cacti, as well as other plants) were often ignored. [[Curt Backeberg]], in particular, is said to have named or renamed 1,200 species without one of his names ever being attached to a specimen, which, according to [[David Hunt (botanist)|David Hunt]], ensured he \"left a trail of nomenclatural chaos that will probably vex cactus taxonomists for centuries.\"{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=98}}\n\n===Classification===\n{{main article|Classification of the Cactaceae}}\nIn 1984, it was decided that the Cactaceae Section of the [[International Organization for Succulent Plant Study]] should set up a working party, now called the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG), to produce consensus classifications down to the level of genera. Their system has been used as the basis of subsequent classifications.

Stems are usually not divided into segments, and are ribbed or tuberculate.

The [[Computational phylogenetics#Bayesian inference|Bayesian]] consensus [[cladogram]] from this study is shown below.<ref name=EdwaNyffDono05/>\n\n{{clade|style=line-height:100%\n|label1=Cactaceae\n|1={{clade\n   |1=''Pereskia'' Clade A\n   |label2=caulocacti\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=''Pereskia'' Clade B\n      |label2=core cacti\n      |2={{clade\n         |1=Opuntioideae\n         |2={{clade\n            |1=''Maihuenia''\n            |2=Cactoideae\n            }}\n         }}\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n\nA more recent 2011 study using fewer genes but more species also found that ''Pereskia'' was divided into these two clades, but was unable to resolve the members of the \"core cacti\" clade. It was accepted that the relationships shown above are \"the most robust to date.\"<ref name=BarcYessHawk11/>\n\nThe two clades of ''Pereskia'' differ in their geographical distribution; with one exception, clade A is found around the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Caribbean Sea]], whereas clade B occurs south of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Species of ''Pereskia'' within clade A always lack two key features of the stem present in most of the remaining \"caulocacti\": like most non-cacti, their stems begin to form [[Bark (botany)|bark]] early in the plants' life and also lack [[stoma]]ta\u2014structures that control admission of air into a plant and hence control [[photosynthesis]]. By contrast, caulocacti, including species of ''Pereskia'' clade B, typically delay forming bark and have stomata on their stems, thus giving the stem the potential to become a major organ for photosynthesis. (The two highly specialized species of ''[[Maihuenia]]'' are something of an exception.)<ref name=EdwaNyffDono05/>\n\nThe first cacti are thought to have been only slightly succulent shrubs or small trees whose leaves carried out photosynthesis. They lived in tropical areas that experienced periodic drought. If ''Pereskia'' clade A is a good model of these early cacti, then, although they would have appeared superficially similar to other trees growing nearby, they had already evolved strategies to conserve water (some of which are present in members of other families in the order [[Caryophyllales]]). These strategies included being able to respond rapidly to periods of rain, and keeping transpiration low by using water very efficiently during photosynthesis. The latter was achieved by tightly controlling the opening of stomata. Like ''Pereskia'' species today, early ancestors may have been able to switch from the normal C<sub>3</sub> mechanism, where carbon dioxide is used continuously in photosynthesis, to CAM cycling, in which when the stomata are closed, carbon dioxide produced by respiration is stored for later use in photosynthesis.<ref name=EdwaDono06/>\n\n''Pereskia'' clade B marks the beginnings of an evolutionary switch to using stems as photosynthetic organs. Stems have stomata and the formation of bark takes place later than in normal trees. The \"core cacti\" show a steady increase in both stem succulence and photosynthesis accompanied by multiple losses of leaves, more-or-less complete in the Cactoideae. One evolutionary question at present unanswered is whether the switch to full CAM photosynthesis in stems occurred only once in the core cacti, in which case it has been lost in ''Maihuenia'', or separately in Opuntioideae and Cactoideae, in which case it never evolved in ''Maihuenia''.<ref name=EdwaDono06/>\n\nUnderstanding evolution within the core cacti clade is difficult {{as of|2012|February|lc=yes}}, since phylogenetic relationships are still uncertain and not well related to current classifications. Thus, a 2011 study found \"an extraordinarily high proportion of genera\" were not [[monophyletic]], so were not all descendants of a single common ancestor. For example, of the 36 genera in the subfamily Cactoideae sampled in the research, 22 (61%) were found not monophyletic.<ref name=BarcYessHawk11/> Nine tribes are recognized within Cactoideae in the International Cactaceae Systematics Group (ICSG) classification; one, Calymmantheae, comprises a single genus, ''Calymmanthium''.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=99\u2013103}} Only two of the remaining eight \u2013 Cacteae and Rhipsalideae \u2013 were shown to be monophyletic in a 2011 study by Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. For a more detailed discussion of the phylogeny of the cacti, see [[Classification of the Cactaceae#Phylo|Classification of the Cactaceae]].\n\n===Evolutionary history===\n\nNo known fossils of cacti exist to throw light on their evolutionary history.<ref name=ArakChriNyffLend11/> However, the geographical distribution of cacti offers some evidence. Except for a relatively recent spread of ''[[Rhipsalis baccifera]]'' to parts of the [[Old World]], cacti are plants of [[South America]] and mainly southern regions of [[North America]]. This suggests the family must have evolved after the ancient continent of [[Gondwana]] split into South America and [[Africa]], which occurred during the [[Early Cretaceous]], around {{Period span/brief|Early Cretaceous}}.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=37\u201338}} Precisely when after this split cacti evolved is less clear. Older sources suggest an early origin around 90 \u2013 66 million years ago, during the [[Late Cretaceous]]. More recent molecular studies suggest a much younger origin, perhaps in very Late [[Eocene]] to early [[Oligocene]] periods, around 35\u201330&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=ArakChriNyffLend11/><ref name=Nyff02/> Based on the phylogeny of the cacti, the earliest diverging group (''Pereskia'' clade A) may have originated in Central America and northern South America, whereas the caulocacti, those with more-or-less succulent stems, evolved later in the southern part of South America, and then moved northwards.<ref name=EdwaNyffDono05/> Core cacti, those with strongly succulent stems, are estimated to have evolved around 25&nbsp;million years ago.<ref name=ArakChriNyffLend11/>  A possible stimulus to their evolution may have been uplifting in the central [[Andes]], some 25\u201320&nbsp;million years ago, which was associated with increasing and varying aridity.<ref name=EdwaNyffDono05/> However, the current species diversity of cacti is thought to have arisen only in the last 10\u20135&nbsp;million years (from the late [[Miocene]] into the [[Pliocene]]). Other succulent plants, such as the [[Aizoaceae]] in South Africa, the [[Didiereaceae]] in Madagascar and the genus ''[[Agave]]'' in the Americas, appear to have diversified at the same time, which coincided with a global expansion of arid environments.<ref name=ArakChriNyffLend11/>\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Cactaceae distrib kz plus arrow.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Distribution of cacti; {{legend|#17A9D6|''{{w|Rhipsalis baccifera}}'' only}} \n{{legend|#035D1F|All other cacti}}]]\n<!--[[File:Opuntia dillenii (Los Sauces) 01 ies.jpg|thumb|''Opuntia'' naturalized in the [[Canary Islands]]]]-->\nCacti inhabit diverse regions, from [[coastal plains]] to high mountain areas. With one exception, they are native to the [[Americas]], where their range extends from [[Patagonia]] to [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]] in western [[Canada]]. A number of centers of diversity exist. For cacti adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States; the southwestern [[Andes]], where they are found in [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]]; and eastern [[Brazil]], away from the [[Amazon Basin]]. Tree-living epiphytic and climbing cacti necessarily have different centers of diversity, as they require moister environments. They are mainly found in the coastal mountains and Atlantic forests of southeastern Brazil; in Bolivia, which is the center of diversity for the subfamily [[Rhipsalideae]]; and in forested regions of [[Central America]], where the climbing [[Hylocereeae]] are most diverse.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=39\u201340}}\n\n''[[Rhipsalis baccifera]]'' is the exception; it is native to both the Americas and the [[Old World]], where it is found in tropical [[Africa]], [[Madagascar]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. One theory is  it was spread by  being carried as [[seed]]s in the [[digestive tract]]s of [[Bird migration|migratory]] [[bird]]s; the seeds of ''Rhipsalis'' are adapted for bird distribution. Old World populations are [[polyploid]], and regarded as distinct subspecies, supporting the idea that the spread was not recent.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|p=611}} The alternative theory is the species initially crossed the Atlantic on European ships trading between South America and Africa, after which birds may have spread it more widely.<ref name=CotaBomf10/>\n\nMany other species have become naturalized outside the Americas after having been introduced by people, especially in [[Australia]], [[Hawaii]], and the [[Mediterranean region]]. In Australia, species of ''[[Opuntia]]'', particularly ''[[Opuntia stricta]]'', were introduced in the 19th century for use as natural agricultural fences and in an attempt to establish a [[cochineal]] industry. They rapidly became a major weed problem, but are now controlled by biological agents, particularly the moth ''[[Cactoblastis cactorum]]''.<ref name=weeds_australia/> The weed potential of Opuntia species in Australia continues however, leading to all opuntioid cacti except ''[[Opuntia ficus-indica|O. ficus-indica]]'' being declared [[Weeds of National Significance]] by the [[Australian Weeds Committee]] in April 2012.\n\n==Reproductive ecology==\n[[File:Schlumbergera 06 ies trimmed.jpg|thumb|Flower of ''[[Schlumbergera]]'' cut in half, showing typical adaptations to [[bird pollination]]|alt=Flower cut in half vertically with the base to the left; the bases of the tepals form a kind of tube, the upper parts bending away from the tube; the stamens run the full length of the flower from left to right and emerge from the end; some start at the very base of the flower, others start from further along to the right, being joined to a tepal.]]\n[[File:Saguaroflowers.jpg|thumb|Flowers of [[saguaro]] showing flattish white flowers adapted for bat pollination]]\nCactus flowers are [[Pollination|pollinated]] by insects, birds and bats. None are known to be wind-pollinated and self-pollination occurs in only a very few species; for example the flowers of some species of ''[[Frailea]]'' do not open ([[cleistogamy]]).{{sfnp|Anderson|2001|p=33}} The need to attract [[pollinators]] has led to the evolution of [[pollination syndromes]], which are defined as groups of \"floral traits, including rewards, associated with the attraction and utilization of a specific group of animals as pollinators.\"{{sfnp|ps=none|Fenster|Armbruster|Wilson|Dudash|2004|p=376}}\n\n[[Bee]]s are the most common pollinators of cacti; bee-pollination is considered to have been the first to evolve.{{sfnp|Anderson|2001|p=33}} Day-flying butterflies and nocturnal moths are associated with different pollination syndromes. Butterfly-pollinated flowers are usually brightly colored, opening during the day, whereas moth-pollinated flowers are often white or pale in color, opening only in the evening and at night.<ref name=HartNasoBhat02/> As an example, ''[[Pachycereus schottii]]'' is pollinated by a particular species of moth, ''[[Upiga virescens]]'', which also lays its eggs among the developing seeds its caterpillars later consume.<ref name=HartNasoBhat02/> The flowers of this cactus are funnel-shaped, white to deep pink, up to {{convert|4|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long, and open at night.{{sfnp|Anderson|2001|p=537}}\n\n[[Hummingbird]]s are significant pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red end of the spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not [[Floral symmetry|radially symmetrical]], with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of [[nectar]] with a relatively low sugar content.<ref name=FensArmbWilsDuda04/> ''[[Schlumbergera]]'' species, such as ''[[Schlumbergera truncata|S. truncata]]'', have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome.{{sfnp|McMillan|Horobin|1995|p=49ff}} Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include ''[[Cleistocactus]]'' and ''[[Disocactus]]''.{{sfnp|Anderson|2001|p=33}}\n\nBat-pollination is relatively uncommon in flowering plants, but about a quarter of the genera of cacti are known to be pollinated by [[bat]]s\u2014an unusually high proportion, exceeded among [[eudicots]] by only two other families, both with very few genera. Columnar cacti growing in semidesert areas are among those most likely to be bat-pollinated; this may be because bats are able to travel considerable distances, so are effective pollinators of plants growing widely separated from one another. The pollination syndrome associated with bats includes a tendency for flowers to open in the evening and at night, when bats are active. Other features include a relatively dull color, often white or green; a radially symmetrical shape, often tubular; a smell described as \"musty\"; and the production of a large amount of sugar-rich nectar. ''[[Carnegiea gigantea]]'' is an example of a bat-pollinated cactus, as are many species of ''[[Pachycereus]]'' and ''[[Pilosocereus]]''.<ref name=FlemGeisKres09/>\n\nThe [[fruit]]s produced by cacti after the flowers have been fertilized vary considerably; many are fleshy, although some are dry. All contain a large number of seeds. Fleshy, colorful and sweet-tasting fruits are associated with seed dispersal by birds. The seeds pass through their digestive systems and are deposited in their droppings. Fruit that falls to the ground may be eaten by other animals; [[Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise|giant tortoises]] are reported to distribute ''Opuntia'' seeds in the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands. [[Ant]]s appear to disperse the seeds of a few genera, such as ''[[Blossfeldia]]''. Drier spiny fruits may cling to the fur of mammals or be moved around by the wind.{{sfnp|Anderson|2001|pp=35\u201336}}\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Early history===\n\n{{As of|2012|March}}, there is still controversy as to the precise dates when humans first entered those areas of the New World where cacti are commonly found, and hence when they might first have used them. An archaeological site in [[Chile]] has been dated to around 15,000 years ago,<ref name=GoebWateORou08/> suggesting cacti would have been encountered before then. Early evidence of the use of cacti includes cave paintings in the [[Serra da Capivara National Park|Serra da Capivara]] in [[Brazil]], and seeds found in ancient [[midden]]s (waste dumps) in [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], with dates estimated at 12,000\u20139,000 years ago. Hunter-gatherers likely collected cactus fruits in the wild and brought them back to their camps.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=43}}\n{{multiple image\n|total_width=480\n|width1=838|height1=535|image1=Codex Osuna Triple Alliance.JPG|caption1=The central image in this extract from the [[Aztec codices#Codex Osuna|Codex Osuna]] of 1565 shows an [[opuntia]] used as a symbol for [[Tenochtitlan]] (now in Mexico City)\n|width2=579|height2=525|image2=Coat of arms of Mexico.svg|caption2=The [[coat of arms of Mexico]] depicts a [[Mexican golden eagle]] perched on an opuntia, devouring a snake\n}}\nIt is not known when cacti were first cultivated. Opuntias (prickly pears) were used for a variety of purposes by the [[Aztec]]s, whose empire, lasting from the 14th to the 16th century, had a complex system of horticulture. Their capital from the 15th century was [[Tenochtitlan]] (now [[Mexico City]]); one explanation for the origin of the name is that it includes the [[Nahuatl]] word ''n\u014dchtli'', referring to the fruit of an opuntia.<ref name=Andr03/> The [[coat of arms of Mexico]] shows an eagle perched on a cactus while holding a snake, an image at the center of the myth of the founding of Tenochtitlan.<ref name=AvenCalnHart88/> The Aztecs symbolically linked the ripe red fruits of an opuntia to human hearts; just as the fruit quenches thirst, so offering human hearts to the sun god ensured the sun would keep moving.<ref name=Barroqueiro/>\n\nEuropeans first encountered cacti when they arrived in the New World late in the 15th century. Their first landfalls were in the [[West Indies]], where relatively few cactus genera are found; one of the most common is the genus ''[[Melocactus]]''.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=17}} Thus, melocacti were possibly among the first cacti seen by Europeans. ''Melocactus'' species were present in English collections of cacti before the end of the 16th century (by 1570 according to one source,<ref name=Rowl97/>) where they were called ''Echinomelocactus'', later shortened to ''Melocactus'' by Joseph Pitton de Tourneville in the early 18th century.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=456\u2013459}} Cacti, both purely ornamental species and those with edible fruit, continued to arrive in Europe, so [[Carl Linnaeus]] was able to name 22 species by 1753. One of these, his ''Cactus opuntia'' (now part of ''Opuntia ficus-indica''), was described as \"{{lang|la|fructu majore ... nunc in Hispania et Lusitania}}\" (with larger fruit ... now in Spain and Portugal), indicative of its early use in Europe.<ref name=Linn53I466/><ref name=Grif04/>\n\n===Food===\n[[File:Prickly pears.jpg|thumb|Peeled fruits of the [[Indian fig cactus]] of different varieties on sale in Mexico]]\nThe plant now known as ''[[Opuntia ficus-indica]]'', or the Indian fig cactus, has long been an important source of food. The original species is thought to have come from central Mexico, although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties ([[cultivar]]s), including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias. Both the fruit and pads are eaten, the former often under the Spanish name ''tuna'', the latter under the name ''[[nopal]]''. Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=51\u201354}} The nopal industry in Mexico was said to be worth US$150&nbsp;million in 2007.<ref name=Dani07/> The Indian fig cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived, and was soon after brought to Europe. It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area, both naturally and by being introduced\u2014so much so, early botanists assumed it was native to the area. Outside the Americas, the Indian fig cactus is an important commercial crop in [[Sicily]], [[Algeria]] and other North African countries.<ref name=Grif04/> Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten, generally under the same name, ''tuna''. Flower buds, particularly of ''[[Cylindropuntia]]'' species, are also consumed.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nAlmost any fleshy cactus fruit is edible. The word ''[[pitaya]]'' or ''pitahaya'' (usually considered to have been taken into Spanish from Haitian creole<ref name=Collins/>) can be applied to a range of \"scaly fruit\", particularly those of columnar cacti. The fruit of the saguaro (''[[Carnegiea gigantea]]'') has long been important to the indigenous peoples of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States, including the [[Sonoran Desert]]. It can be preserved by boiling to produce syrup and by drying. The syrup can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic drink. Fruits of ''Stenocereus'' species have also been important food sources in similar parts of North America; ''[[Stenocereus queretaroensis]]'' is cultivated for its fruit. In more tropical southern areas, the climber ''[[Hylocereus undatus]]'' provides ''pitahaya orejona'', now widely grown in Asia under the name dragon fruit. Other cacti providing edible fruit include species of  ''[[Echinocereus]]'', ''[[Ferocactus]]'', ''[[Mammillaria]]'', ''[[Myrtillocactus]]'', ''[[Pachycereus]]'', ''[[Peniocereus]]'' and ''[[Selenicereus]]''. The bodies of cacti other than opuntias are less often eaten, although Anderson reported that ''[[Neowerdermannia vorwerkii]]'' is prepared and eaten like potatoes in upland Bolivia.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=55\u201359}}\n{{center|'''Cacti as food'''}}\n<gallery mode=packed heights=155 style=\"font-size:95%; line-height:120%\">\nSaguaro_gatherers2.jpg|Gathering [[saguaro]] in 1907\nSaguaro fruit.jpg|Edible fruit of the saguaro\nBarrel Cactus Fruit cropped.jpg|Fruits of some ''[[Ferocactus]]'' are edible.\nDragonfruit Chiayi market.jpg|[[Dragon fruit]] for sale in Taiwan\nFruto de Stenocereus queretaroensis.jpg|Fruit prepared from ''[[Stenocereus queretaroensis]]''\nNopal11.jpg|Salad including sliced ''nopales'' ([[opuntia]] pads)\n</gallery>\n\n{{see also|List of edible cacti}}\n\n===Psychoactive agents===\n[[Image:Peyote Cactus.jpg|thumb|''[[Lophophora williamsii]]'' in the wild]]\n[[Image:Chavin-cactus-stone.jpg|thumb|upright|Stone carving from [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar]], dated to ''circa'' 1000 BC, showing a figure carrying what is thought to be the [[San Pedro cactus]]]]\nA number of species of cacti have been shown to contain [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive agents]], chemical compounds that can cause changes in mood, perception and cognition through their effects on the brain.

Suppliers of cacti and other succulents employed collectors to obtain plants from the wild, in addition to growing their own. In the late 1800s, collectors turned to orchids, and cacti became less popular, although never disappearing from cultivation.{{sfnp|ps=none|Keen|1990|p=15}}\n\nCacti are often grown in greenhouses, particularly in regions unsuited to the cultivation of cacti outdoors, such the northern parts of Europe and North America. Here, they may be kept in pots or grown in the ground. Cacti are also grown as [[houseplant]]s, many being tolerant of the often dry atmosphere. Cacti in pots may be placed outside in the summer to ornament gardens or patios, and then kept under cover during the winter.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|1999|pp=24\u201341}} Less drought-resistant [[epiphyte]]s, such as [[epiphyllum hybrid]]s, ''[[Schlumbergera]]'' (the Thanksgiving or Christmas cactus) and ''[[Hatiora]]'' (the Easter cactus), are widely cultivated as houseplants.\n[[File:Gibraltar cactus.jpg|thumb|A planted cactus in [[Gibraltar]]. The hot and relatively dry climate of the territory allows cacti to thrive.]]\nCacti may also be planted outdoors in regions with suitable climates. Concern for water conservation in arid regions has led to the promotion of gardens requiring less watering ([[xeriscaping]]). For example, in [[California]], the East Bay Municipal Utility District sponsored the publication of a book on plants and landscapes for summer-dry climates.<ref name=HarlCoat04/> Cacti are one group of drought-resistant plants recommended for dry landscape gardening.<ref name=DGB/>\n\n===Other uses===\n\nCacti have many other uses. They are used for human food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines.<ref name=ShetRanaPree11/> In addition to their use as psychoactive agents, some cacti are employed in [[herbal medicine]]. The practice of using various species of ''Opuntia'' in this way has spread from the Americas, where they naturally occur, to other regions where they grow, such as [[India]].{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=61\u201362}}\n\n[[Cochineal]] is a red dye produced by a [[scale insect]] that lives on species of ''Opuntia''. Long used by the  peoples of Central and North America, demand fell rapidly when European manufacturers began to produce synthetic dyes in the middle of the 19th century. Commercial production has now increased following a rise in demand for natural dyes.<ref name=GoOaxaca/>\n\nCacti are used as construction materials. Living [[cactus fence]]s are employed as barricades. The woody parts of cacti, such as ''[[Cereus repandus]]'' and ''[[Echinopsis atacamensis]]'', are used in buildings and in furniture. The frames of [[wattle and daub]] houses built by the [[Seri people]] of Mexico may use parts of ''[[Carnegiea gigantea]]''. The very fine spines and hairs (trichomes) of some cacti were used as a source of fiber for filling pillows and in weaving.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=69\u201372}}\n\n==Conservation==\n[[File:Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus flor cropped.jpg|thumb|''[[Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus]]'', an endangered species protected under Appendix I of CITES]]\nAll cacti are included in Appendix II of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES), which \"lists species that are not necessarily now threatened with extinction but that may become so unless trade is closely controlled.\" Control is exercised by making international trade in most specimens of cacti illegal unless permits have been issued, at least for exports.<ref name=CITES_App>{{citation |title=The CITES Appendices |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.php |publisher=[[CITES]] |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414034639/http://www.cites.org/eng/app/index.php |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}</ref> Some exceptions are allowed, e.g., for \"naturalized or artificially propagated plants\".<ref name=CITES_Cactaceae>{{citation |title=Appendices I, II and III |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php |publisher=[[CITES]] |accessdate=2012-04-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6B6FXtv06?url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php |archivedate=2012-10-01 |df= }}; see \"Cactaceae\" and linked footnotes</ref> Some cacti, such as all ''[[Ariocarpus]]'' and ''[[Discocactus]]'' species, are included in the more restrictive Appendix I,<ref name=CITES_Cactaceae/> used for the \"most endangered\" species. These may only be moved between countries for scientific purposes, and only then when accompanied by both export and import permits.<ref name=CITES_App/>\n\nThe three main threats to cacti in the wild are development, grazing and over-collection. Development takes many forms. The construction of a dam near [[Zimapan]], [[Mexico]], caused the destruction of a large part of the natural habitat of ''[[Echinocactus grusonii]]''. Urban development and highways have destroyed cactus habitats in parts of Mexico, [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], including the [[Sonoran Desert]]. The conversion of land to agriculture has affected populations of ''[[Ariocarpus kotschoubeyanus]]'' in Mexico, where dry plains were plowed for maize cultivation, and of ''[[Copiapoa]]'' and ''[[Eulychnia]]'' in [[Chile]], where valley slopes were planted with vines.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=73\u201375}} Grazing, in many areas by introduced animals, such as goats, has caused serious damage to populations of cacti (as well as other plants);  two examples cited by Anderson are the [[Gal\u00e1pagos Islands]] generally and the effect on ''[[Browningia candelaris]]'' in [[Peru]]. Over-collection of cacti for sale has greatly affected some species. For example, the type locality of ''[[Pelecyphora strobiliformis]]'' near [[Miquihuana, Tamaulipas|Miquihuana]], Mexico, was virtually denuded of plants, which were dug up for sale in Europe. Illegal collecting of cacti from the wild continues to pose a threat.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=77\u201379}}\n\nConservation of cacti can be ''in situ'' or ''ex situ''. ''In situ'' conservation involves preserving habits through enforcement of legal protection and the creation of specially protected areas such as national parks and reserves. Examples of such protected areas in the United States include [[Big Bend National Park]], Texas; [[Joshua Tree National Park]], California; and [[Saguaro National Park]], Arizona. Latin American examples include [[El Pinacate y Gran Desierto de Altar Biosphere Reserve|Parque Nacional del Pinacate]], Sonora, Mexico and [[Pan de Az\u00facar National Park]], Chile. ''Ex situ'' conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats, often with the intention of later reintroduction. [[Botanical garden]]s play an important role in ''ex situ'' conservation; for example, seeds of cacti and other succulents are kept in long-term storage at the [[Desert Botanical Garden]], Arizona.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|2001|pp=79\u201381}}\n\n==Cultivation==\n[[File:Notocactuswarasii.jpg|Notocactuswarasii|thumb|right|Cultivated ''[[Notocactus warasii]]'' at the [[San Diego County Fair]], California]]\nThe popularity of cacti means many books are devoted to their cultivation. Cacti naturally occur in a wide range of habitats and are then grown in many countries with different climates, so precisely replicating the conditions in which a species normally grows is usually not practical.{{sfnp|ps=none|Keen|1990|p=15}} A broad distinction can be made between semidesert cacti and epiphytic cacti, which need different conditions and are best grown separately.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=22}} This section is primarily concerned with the cultivation of semidesert cacti in containers and under protection, such as in a greenhouse or in the home, rather than cultivation outside in the ground in those climates that permit it. For the cultivation of epiphytic cacti, see [[Schlumbergera#Cultivation|Cultivation of ''Schlumbergera'']] (Christmas or Thanksgiving cacti), and [[Epiphyllum hybrid#Cultivation|Cultivation of epiphyllum hybrids]].\n\n===Growing medium===\n[[File:DarjeelingCactus.JPG|thumb|Cacti in a greenhouse in [[Darjeeling]], India ]]\nThe purpose of the growing medium is  to provide support and to store water, oxygen and dissolved minerals to feed the plant.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=87}} In the case of cacti, there is general agreement that an open medium with a high air content is important. When cacti are grown in containers, recommendations as to how this should be achieved vary greatly; Miles Anderson says that if asked to describe a perfect growing medium, \"ten growers would give 20 different answers\".{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|1999|p=217}} Roger Brown suggests a mixture of two parts commercial soilless [[growing medium]], one part [[hydroponic]] clay and one part coarse [[pumice]] or [[perlite]], with the addition of soil from earthworm castings.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=87}} The general recommendation of 25\u201375% organic-based material, the rest being inorganic such as pumice, perlite or grit, is supported by other sources.{{sfnp|ps=none|Anderson|1999|p=217}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Hewitt|1993|p=147}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=23}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Keen|1990|pp=27\u201328}} However, the use of organic material is rejected altogether by others; Hecht says that cacti (other than epiphytes) \"want soil that is low in or free of [[humus]]\", and recommends coarse sand as the basis of a growing medium.{{sfnp|ps=none|Hecht|1994|p=140}}\n\n===Watering===\n\nSemi-desert cacti need careful watering. General advice is hard to give, since the frequency of watering required depends on where the cacti are being grown, the nature of the growing medium, and the original habitat of the cacti.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pilbeam|1987|p=10}} Brown says that more cacti are lost through the \"untimely application of water than for any other reason\" and that even during the dormant winter season, cacti need some water.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=88}} Other sources say that water can be withheld during winter (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere).{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=22}} Another issue is the hardness of the water; where it is necessary to use [[hard water]], regular [[re-potting]] is recommended to avoid the build up of salts.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=88}} The general advice given is that during the growing season, cacti should be allowed to dry out between thorough waterings.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=88}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Hewitt|1993|p=151}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=22}} A water meter can help in determining when the soil is dry.{{sfnp|ps=none|Hewitt|1993|p=151}}\n\n===Light and temperature===\n\nAlthough semi-desert cacti may be exposed to high light levels in the wild, they may still need some shading when subjected to the higher light levels and temperatures of a greenhouse in summer.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=85}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Hewitt|1993|p=150}} Allowing the temperature to rise above {{convert|32|C|F}} is not recommended.{{sfnp|ps=none|Hewitt|1993|p=150}} The minimum winter temperature required depends very much on the species of cactus involved. For a mixed collection, a minimum temperature of between {{convert|5|C|F}} and {{convert|10|C|F}} is often suggested, except for cold-sensitive genera such as ''[[Melocactus]]'' and ''[[Discocactus]]''.{{sfnp|ps=none|Pilbeam|1987|p=11}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=22}} Some cacti, particularly those from the high [[Andes]], are fully frost-hardy when kept dry (e.g. ''[[Rebutia minuscula]]'' survives temperatures down to {{convert|\u22129|C|F}} in cultivation<ref name=Amos12/>) and may flower better when exposed to a period of cold.<ref name=Shea12/>\n\n===Propagation===\nCacti can be propagated by seed, [[Cutting (plant)|cuttings]] or [[grafting]]. Seed sown early in the year produces seedlings that benefit from a longer growing period.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=28}} Seed is sown in a moist growing medium and then kept in a covered environment, until 7\u201310 days after germination, to avoid drying out.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=92}} A very wet growing medium can cause both seeds and seedlings to rot.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=27}} A temperature range of {{convert|18|\u2013|30|C|F|0}} is suggested for germination; soil temperatures of around {{convert|22|C|F|0}} promote the best root growth. Low light levels are sufficient during germination, but afterwards semi-desert cacti need higher light levels to produce strong growth, although [[acclimatization]] is needed to conditions in a greenhouse, such as higher temperatures and strong sunlight.{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=92}}\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 14907 The Cactus Avenue.JPG|thumb|Grafted forms of ''[[Gymnocalycium mihanovichii]]'' grown in Israel]]\nReproduction by cuttings makes use of parts of a plant that can grow roots. Some cacti produce \"pads\" or \"joints\" that can be detached or cleanly cut off. Other cacti produce offsets that can be removed.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=28}} Otherwise, stem cuttings can be made, ideally from relatively new growth. It is recommended that any cut surfaces be allowed to dry for a period of several days to several weeks until a [[Callus (cell biology)|callus]] forms over the cut surface. Rooting can then take place in an appropriate growing medium at a temperature of around {{convert|22|C|F|0}}.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=28}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|p=92}}\n\nGrafting is used for species difficult to grow well in cultivation or that cannot grow independently, such as some [[chlorophyll]]-free forms with white, yellow or red bodies, or some forms that show abnormal growth (e.g., [[Fasciation|cristate]] or {{linktext|monstrose}} forms). For the host plant (the [[stock (grafting)|stock]]), growers choose one that grows strongly in cultivation and is compatible with the plant to be propagated: the [[scion (grafting)|scion]]. The grower makes cuts on both stock and scion and joins the two, binding them together while they unite. Various kinds of graft are used\u2014flat grafts, where both scion and stock are of similar diameters, and cleft grafts, where a smaller scion is inserted into a cleft made in the stock.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=29}}\n\nCommercially, huge numbers of cacti are produced annually. For example, in 2002 in Korea alone, 49 million plants were propagated, with a value of almost US$9&nbsp;million. Most of them (31 million plants) were propagated by grafting.<ref name=JeongChoLee2009/>\n\n===Pests and diseases===\n\nA range of pests attack cacti in cultivation. Those that feed on sap include [[mealybug]]s, living on both stems and roots; [[scale insect]]s, generally only found on stems; [[whitefly|whiteflies]], which are said to be an \"infrequent\" pest of cacti;{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|p=32}} [[Tetranychus urticae|red spider mites]], which are very small but can occur in large numbers, constructing a fine web around themselves and badly marking the cactus via their sap sucking, even if they do not kill it; and [[thrips]], which particularly attack flowers. Some of these pests are [[Insecticide resistance|resistant to many insecticides]], although there are [[biological control]]s available. Roots of cacti can be eaten by the larvae of [[Sciaridae|sciarid flies]] and [[fungus gnat]]s. [[Slug]]s and [[snail]]s also eat cacti.{{sfnp|ps=none|Innes|1995|pp=31\u201332}}{{sfnp|ps=none|Brown|2001|pp=90\u201391}}\n\nFungi, bacteria and viruses attack cacti, the first two particularly when plants are over-watered. [[Fusarium oxysporum|Fusarium rot]] can gain entry through a wound and cause rotting accompanied by red-violet mold. \"''Helminosporium'' rot\" is caused by ''[[Bipolaris cactivora]]'' ({{abbr|syn.|synonym}} ''Helminosporium cactivorum''<ref name=SpeciesFungorum/>); ''Phytophthora'' species also cause similar rotting in cacti. [[Fungicides]] may be of limited value in combating these diseases.{{sfnp|ps=none|Hecht|1994|p=152}} Several viruses have been found in cacti, including [[cactus virus X]]. These appear to cause only limited visible symptoms, such as [[chlorotic]] (pale green) spots and mosaic effects (streaks and patches of paler color).<ref name=DuarAlexRivaHara08/> However, in an ''Agave'' species, cactus virus X has been shown to reduce growth, particularly when the roots are dry.<ref name=IzagMaryOlivOrop95/> There are no treatments for virus diseases.{{sfnp|ps=none|Hecht|1994|p=152}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em|refs=\n\n<ref name=Amos12>{{Citation |last=Amos |first=Robert |year=2012 |title=Show Reports: Malvern Show |journal=The Alpine Gardener |volume=80 |issue=1 |pages=80\u201383 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Andr03>{{Citation |last=Andrews |first=J.

The CCC was a major part of President [[Franklin D.

The CCC was designed to provide jobs for young men and to relieve families who had difficulty finding jobs during the [[Great Depression in the United States]]. Maximum enrollment at any one time was 300,000. Through the course of its nine years in operation, 3 million young men participated in the CCC, which provided them with shelter, clothing, and food, together with a wage of $30 (about $570 in 2017<ref>{{Cite web |title=Inflation Calculator: Bureau of Labor Statistics |url=http://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm |website=www.bls.gov |accessdate=January 4, 2016}}</ref>) per month ($25 of which had to be sent home to their families).<ref>John A.

The Emergency Conservation Work (ECW) Act was introduced to Congress the same day and enacted by voice vote on March 31. Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 6101]] on April 5, 1933, which established the CCC organization and appointed a director, [[Robert Fechner]], a former labor union official who served until 1939. The organization and administration of the CCC was a new experiment in operations for a federal government agency. The order indicated that the program was to be supervised jointly by four government departments: [[United States Department of Labor|Labor]], which recruited the young men, [[United States Department of War|War]], which operated the camps, and [[United States Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of the Interior|Interior]], which organized and supervised the work projects. A CCC Advisory Council was composed of a representative from each of the supervising departments.

When the draft began in 1940, the policy was to make CCC alumni corporals and sergeants. CCC also provided command experience to Organized Reserve Corps officers.

On October 1, 1933, Director Fechner was directed to arrange for the second period of enrollment. By January 1934, 300,000 men were enrolled. In July 1934, this cap was increased by 50,000 to include men from Midwest states that had been affected by drought. The temporary tent camps had also developed to include wooden barracks. An education program had been established, emphasizing job training and literacy.<ref name=\"Fechner\"/>{{rp|10}}\n\nApproximately 55% of enrollees were from rural communities, a majority of which were non-farm; 45% came from urban areas.<ref>\"Your CCC, A Handbook for Enrollees\", Happy Days Pub.

At this time, all the states of the South had passed legislation imposing racial segregation and, since the turn of the century, laws and constitutional provisions that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]]; they were excluded from formal politics. Because of discrimination by white officials at the local and state levels, blacks in the South did not receive as many benefits as whites from New Deal programs.\n\nIn the first few weeks of operation, CCC camps in the North were integrated. By July 1935, however, all the camps in the United States were segregated.<ref>{{cite book |author=Kay Rippelmeyer |title=The Civilian Conservation Corps in Southern Illinois, 1933-1942 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ffupBwAAQBAJ&pg=PA98 |year=2015 |publisher=Southern Illinois Press |pages=98\u201399}}</ref>\n\nA total of 200,000 blacks were enrolled in the CCC; they served in 143 all-black camps{{Citation needed|reason=some camps, though internally segregated were not all-black?

Native men from reservations worked on roads, bridges, clinics, shelters, and other public works near their [[Indian reservation|reservations]]. Although they were organized as groups classified as camps, no permanent camps were established for Native Americans. Instead, organized groups moved with their families from project to project and were provided with an additional rental allowance in their pay.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Calvin W. |last=Gower |title=The CCC Indian Division: Aid for Depressed Americans, 1933\u20131942 |journal=Minnesota History |year=1972 |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=3\u201313}}</ref> The CCC often provided the only paid work, as many reservations were in remote rural areas. Enrollees had to be between the ages of 17 and 35.\n\nDuring 1933, about half the male heads of households on the [[Sioux]] reservations in [[South Dakota]] were employed by the CCC-ID.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Roger |last=Bromert |title=The Sioux and the Indian-CCC |journal=South Dakota History |year=1978 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=340\u2013356}}</ref> With grants from the [[Public Works Administration]] (PWA), the Indian Division built schools and conducted an extensive road-building program in and around many reservations to improve infrastructure. The mission was to reduce erosion and improve the value of Indian lands. Crews built dams of many types on creeks, then sowed grass on the eroded areas from which the damming materials had been taken. They built roads and planted shelter-belts on federal lands. The steady income helped participants regain self-respect, and many used the funds to improve their lives. [[John Collier (reformer)|John Collier]], the federal [[Commissioner of Indian Affairs]] and Daniel Murphy, the director of the CCC-ID, both based the program on Indian self-rule and the restoration of tribal lands, governments, and cultures. The next year, Congress passed the [[Indian Reorganization Act|Indian Reorganization Act of 1934]], which ended allotments and helped preserve tribal lands, and encouraged tribes to re-establish self-government.\n\nCollier said of the CCC-Indian Division, \"no previous undertaking in Indian Service has so largely been the Indians' own undertaking\". Education programs also trained participants in gardening, stock raising, safety, native arts, and some academic subjects.<ref name=\"Hanneman\">{{cite journal |first=Carolyn G. |last=Hanneman |title=Baffles, Bridges, and Bermuda: Oklahoma Indians and the Civilian Conservation Corps-Indian Division |journal=Chronicles of Oklahoma |year=1999 |volume=77 |issue=4 |pages=428\u2013449}}</ref> IECW differed from other CCC activities in that it explicitly trained men in skills to be carpenters, truck drivers, radio operators, mechanics, surveyors, and technicians. With the passage of the [[National Defense Vocational Training Act of 1941]], enrollees began participating in defense-oriented training. The government paid for the classes and after individuals completed courses and passed a competency test, guaranteed automatic employment in the defense work. A total of 85,000 Native Americans were enrolled in this training. This proved valuable social capital for the 24,000 alumni who later served in the military and the 40,000 who left the reservations for city jobs supporting the war effort.\n\n===Program expansion, 1935\u20131936===\nResponding to favorable public opinion to alleviate unemployment, Congress approved the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]], on April 8, 1935, which included continued funding for the CCC program through March 31, 1937. The age limit was expanded to 18-28 to include more men.<ref name=\"Fechner\"/>{{rp|11}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://digilab.browardlibrary.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/ccc&CISOPTR=691&CISOSHOW=658 |title=Digital Archives |publisher=}}</ref> From April 1, 1935 to March 31, 1936 was the period of greatest activity and work accomplished by the CCC program. Enrollment had peaked at 505,782 in about 2,900 camps by August 31, 1935, followed by a reduction to 350,000 enrollees in 2,019 camps by June 30, 1936.<ref>Ermentrout, p. 33</ref> During this period the public response to the CCC program was overwhelmingly popular. A [[Gallup poll]] of April 18, 1936, asked: \"Are you in favor of the CCC camps?\"; 82% of respondents said yes, including 92% of [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 67% of [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]].<ref>''Public Opinion, 1935\u20131946,'' ed. by Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk (1951), p. 111</ref>\n\n===Change of purpose, 1937\u20131938===\nOn June 28, 1937, the Civilian Conservation Corps was legally established and transferred from its original designation as the Emergency Conservation Work program. Funding was extended for three more years by Public Law No. 163, [[75th Congress]], effective July 1, 1937. Congress changed the age limits to 17\u201323 years old and changed the requirement that enrollees be on relief to \"not regularly in attendance at school, or possessing full-time employment.\"<ref>Civilian Conservation Corps, \"Standards of Eligibility and Selection for Junior Enrollees,\" United States Dept. of Labor, Office of the Secretary, August 1, 1938,</ref> The 1937 law mandated the inclusion of vocational and academic training for a minimum of 10 hours per week. Students in school were allowed to enroll during summer vacation.<ref>Ermentrout, pp. 48\u201349, 51</ref> During this period, the CCC forces contributed to disaster relief following 1937 floods in New York, Vermont, and the [[Ohio River flood of 1937|Ohio]] and Mississippi river valleys, and response and clean-up after the [[New England Hurricane of 1938|1938 hurricane in New England]].\n\n===Conservation to Defense, 1939\u20131940===\nIn 1939 Congress ended the independent status of the CCC, transferring it to the control of the [[Federal Security Agency]]. The [[National Youth Administration]], [[United States Employment Service|U.S. Employment Service]], the [[Office of Education]], and the [[Works Progress Administration]] also had some responsibilities. About 5,000 Reserve officers for the camps were affected, as they were transferred to federal [[Civil Service]], and military ranks and titles were eliminated. Despite the loss of overt military leadership in the camps by July 1940, with war underway in Europe and Asia, the government directed an increasing number of CCC projects on resources for national defense. It developed infrastructure for military training facilities and forest protection. By 1940 the CCC was no longer wholly a relief agency, was rapidly losing its non-military character, and it was becoming a system for work-training, as its ranks had become increasingly younger, with little experience.<ref>Ermentrout, pp. 55, 62, 64</ref>\n\n===Decline and disbandment 1941\u20131942===\nAlthough the CCC was probably the most popular New Deal program, it never was authorized as a permanent agency. The program was reduced in scale as the Depression waned and employment opportunities improved. After [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|conscription began in 1940]], fewer eligible young men were available. Following the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, the Roosevelt administration directed all federal programs to emphasize the war effort. Most CCC work, except for wildland firefighting, was shifted onto U.S. military bases to help with construction.\n\nThe CCC disbanded one year earlier than planned, as the [[77th United States Congress]] ceased funding it. Operations were formally concluded at the end of the federal fiscal year on June 30, 1942. The end of the CCC program and closing of the camps involved arrangements to leave the incomplete work projects in the best possible state, the separation of about 1,800 appointed employees, the transfer of CCC property to the War and Navy Departments and other agencies, and the preparation of final accountability records. Liquidation of the CCC was ordered by Congress by the Labor-Federal Security Appropriation Act (56 Stat. 569) on July 2, 1942; and virtually completed on June 30, 1943.<ref>[[Conrad L. Wirth|Wirth, Conrad L.]], ''Civilian Conservation Corps Program of the US Dept. of the Interior, March 1933 to June 30, 1942'', a Report to [[Harold L. Ickes]], January 1944</ref> Liquidation appropriations for the CCC continued through April 20, 1948.\n\nSome former CCC sites in good condition were reactivated from 1941 to 1947 as [[Civilian Public Service]] camps where [[conscientious objector]]s performed \"work of national importance\" as an alternative to military service. Other camps were used to hold [[Japanese American internment|Japanese]], [[Internment of German Americans|German]] and [[Internment of Italian Americans|Italian]] Americans interned under the [[Western Defense Command]]'s Enemy Alien Control Program, as well as Axis [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Civilian%20Conservation%20Corps/ |title=Civilian Conservation Corps |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |accessdate=August 19, 2016}}</ref> Most of the Japanese American internment camps were built by the people held there. After the CCC disbanded, the federal agencies responsible for [[public lands]] organized their own seasonal fire crews, modeled after the CCC. These have performed a firefighting function formerly done by the CCC and provided the same sort of outdoor work experience for young people. Approximately 47 young men have died while in this line of duty.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ccc pillow.jpg|thumb|right|A CCC [[pillowcase]] on display at the CCC Museum in Michigan]]\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===Museums===\n* Civilian Conservation Corps Museum, [[Vogel State Park]], [[Blairsville, Georgia]]\n* [[Colossal Cave (Arizona)|Colossal Cave Mountain Park]], [[Vail, Arizona]]\n* [[Camp San Luis Obispo#Conservation Corps State Museum|Conservation Corps State Museum at Camp San Luis Obispo]], [[San Luis Obispo, California]]\n* [http://www.alapark.com/gallery/monte-sano-state-park-ccc-museum-and-memorial|Civilian Conservation Corps Museum and Memorial] at [[Monte Sano State Park]], [[Huntsville, Alabama]]\n* [http://www.ccclegacy.org/ Civilian Conservation Corps Legacy], [[Edinburg, Virginia]]\n* [[Pioneer Park Historical Complex|Civillan Conservation Corps Museum]], [[Rhinelander, Wisconsin]]\n* [[Highlands Hammock State Park|Florida Civilian Conservation Corps Museum at Highlands Hammock State Park]], [[Sebring, Florida]]\n* [[DeSoto State Park|Civilian Conservation Corps Museum at DeSoto State Park]], [[Fort Payne, Alabama]]\n* [[Civilian Conservation Corps Camp in Koke's State Park]], [[Waimea, Kauai County, Hawaii]], [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Hawaii]]\n* [[Backbone State Park|Iowa Civilian Conservation Corps Museum at Backbone State Park]], [[Strawberry Point, Iowa]]\n* [[Lake Greenwood State Recreation Area|Civilian Conservation Corps Museum at Lake Greenwood State Recreation Area]], [[Ninety Six, South Carolina]]\n* Lou and Helen Adams Civilian Conservation Corps Museum, [[Parker Dam State Park]], [[Huston Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania]].\n* [[Promised Land State Park|Masker Museum at Promised Land State Park]], [[Greentown, Pennsylvania]]\n* [https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/famjustin/Nestates.html&date=2009-10-25+22:02:35 North East States Civilian Conservation Corps Museum], Camp Conner, [[Stafford, Connecticut]]\n* [[Gilbert Lake State Park|New York State Civilian Conservation Corps Museum at Gilbert Lake State Park]], [[New Lisbon, New York]]\n* [[Pocahontas State Park|Civilian Conservation Corps Museum at Pocahontas State Park]], [[Chesterfield, Virginia]]\n* [http://www.wva-ccc-legacy.org/The_Museum.html West Virginia CCC Museum], [[Harrison County, West Virginia]]\n* [http://www.justinmuseum.com/famjustin/ccchis.html James F.

Congress provided funding for closing the remaining camps in 1942 with the equipment being reallocated.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/timeline/ccc/2/|title=Timeline. The Civilian Conservation Corps. American Experience. WGBH - PBS|work=American Experience}}</ref> It became a model for conservation programs that were implemented in the period after World War II. Present-day corps are national, state, and local programs that engage primarily youth and young adults (ages 16\u201325) in community service, training, and educational activities. The nation's approximately 113 corps programs operate in 41 states and the [[District of Columbia]]. During 2004, they enrolled more than 23,000 young people. The Corps Network, known originally as the [[National Association of Service and Conservation Corps]] (NASCC), works to expand and enhance corps-type programs throughout the country. The Corps Network began in 1985 when the nation's first 24 Corps directors banded together to secure an advocate at the federal level and a repository of information on how best to start and manage a corps. Early financial assistance from the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation|Hewlett]] and [[Charles Stewart Mott Foundation|Mott Foundations]] was critical to establishing the association.\n\nAnother similar program is the [[National Civilian Community Corps]], part of the [[AmeriCorps]] program, a team-based national service program in which young adults ages 18\u201324 spend 10 months working for non-profit and government organizations.\n\n===Student Conservation Association===\nThe CCC program became a model for the creation of team-based national service youth conservation programs such as the [[Student Conservation Association]] (SCA). The SCA, founded in 1959, is a nonprofit organization that offers conservation internships and summer trail crew opportunities to more than 4,000 people each year. The SCA mission is to build a new generation of conservation managers by inspiring lifelong [[stewardship]] of the environment and communities by engaging high school and college-age volunteers in hands-on service to the land. SCA program is active nationwide in the USA, including national and state parks, forests, wildlife refuges, seashores and historic sites. SCA National Headquarters is located in [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]], with regional offices across the country.\n\n===California Conservation Corps===\nIn 1976, [[Governor of California]] [[Jerry Brown]] established the [[California Conservation Corps]]. This program had many similar characteristics - residential centers, high expectations for participation, and emphasis on hard work on public lands. Young adults from different backgrounds were recruited for a term of one year. Corps members attended a training session called the Corpsmember Orientation Motivation Education and Training (COMET) program before being assigned to one of the various centers. Project work is also similar to the original CCC of the 1930s - work on public forests, state and federal parks.\n\n===Texas Conservation Corps===\nEstablished in 1995, Environmental Corps, now Texas Conservation Corps (TxCC), is an American YouthWorks program which allows youth, ages 17 to 28, to contribute to the restoration and preservation of parks and public lands in Texas. The only conservation corps in Texas, TxcC is a nonprofit corporation based in [[Austin, Texas]], which serves the entire state. Their work ranges from disaster relief to trail building to habitat restoration. TxCC has done projects in national, state, and city parks.\n\n===Montana Conservation Corps===\nThe [[Montana Conservation Corps]] (MCC) is a non-profit organization with a mission to equip young people with the skills and values to be vigorous citizens who improve their communities and environment. Collectively, MCC crews contribute more than 90,000 work hours each year. The MCC was established in 1991 by [[Montana]]'s Human Resource Development Councils in [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] and [[Kalispell, Montana|Kalispell]]. Originally, it was a summer program for disadvantaged youth, although it has grown into an AmeriCorps-sponsored non-profit organization with six regional offices that serve Montana, [[Idaho]], [[Wyoming]], [[North Dakota]], and [[South Dakota]]. All regions also offer Montana YES (Youth Engaged in Service) summer programs for teenagers who are 14 to 17 years old.\n\n===Washington Conservation Corps===\nThe [[Washington Conservation Corps]] (WCC) is a sub-agency of the [[Washington (state)|Washington]] State Department of Ecology. It employs men and women 18 to 25 years old in a program to protect and enhance Washington's natural resources. WCC is a part of the [[AmeriCorps]] program.\n\n===Minnesota Conservation Corps===\nConservation Corps Minnesota & Iowa provides environmental stewardship and service-learning opportunities to youth and young adults while accomplishing conservation, natural resource management projects and emergency response work through its Young Adult Program and the Summer Youth Program. These programs emphasize the development of job and life skills by conservation and community service work.\n\n===Vermont Youth Conservation Corps===\nThe Vermont Youth Conservation Corps (VYCC) is a non-profit, youth service and education organization that hires Corps Members, aged 16\u201324, to work on high-priority conservation projects in Vermont. Through these work projects, Corps Members develop a strong work ethic, strengthen their leadership skills, and learn how to take personal responsibility for their actions. VYCC Crews work at VT State Parks, U.S. Forest Service Campgrounds, in local communities, and throughout the state's backcountry. The VYCC has also given aid to a similar program in North Carolina, which is currently in its infancy.\n\n===Conservation Legacy===\nConservation Legacy is a non-profit employment, job training, and education organization with locations across the United States including Arizona Conservation Corps in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] and [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]; Southwest Conservation Corps in [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]] and [[Salida, Colorado]]; and Southeast Conservation Corps in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Conservation Legacy also operates an [[AmeriCorps VISTA]] team serving to improve the environment and economies of historic mining communities in the American West and [[Appalachia]]. Conservation Legacy also hosts the Environmental Stewards Program - providing internships with federal, state, municipal and NGO land management agencies nationwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conservationlegacy.org|title=Home - Conservation Legacy|publisher=}}</ref> Conservation Legacy formed as a merger of the Southwest Youth Corps, San Luis Valley Youth Corps, The Youth Corps of Southern Arizona, and Coconino Rural Environmental Corps.\n\nConservation Legacy engages young adults ages 14 to 26 and U.S. military veterans of all ages in personal and professional development experiences involving conservation projects on public lands. Corp members live, work, and learn in teams of six to eight for terms of service ranging from 3 months to 1 year.\n\n==See also==\n[[File:CCC boys leaving camp for home, Lassen National Forest, California (3226900020).jpg|thumb|CCC boys leaving camp for home; [[Lassen National Forest]], California]]\n\n===General links===\n*[[National Youth Administration]]\n*[[Works Progress Administration]]\n\n===CCC Camps===\n*[[[[Rabideau_CCC_Camp|Rabideau CCC Camp]]]]\n*[[She-She-She Camps]]\n*[[Camp Petenwell]]\n*[[Table Rock Civilian Conservation Corps Camp Site]]\n*[[Civilian Conservation Corps Camp in Koke'e State Park]]\n*[[Bear Brook State Park Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) Camp Historic District]]\n*[[Camp San Luis Obispo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*American Youth Commission.

After [[Christopher Columbus]] landed in [[the Bahamas]] in 1492, the Spanish term ''[[Antillas]]'' applied to the lands; stemming from this, \"Sea of the Antilles\" became a common alternative name for \"Caribbean Sea\" in various European languages. During the first century of development, Spanish dominance in the region remained undisputed.\n\nFrom the 16th century, Europeans visiting the Caribbean region identified the [[Great South Sea|\"South Sea\"]] (the Pacific Ocean, to the south of the isthmus of Panama) as opposed to the \"North Sea\" (the Caribbean Sea, to the north of the same isthmus).<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Gorgas\n| first1                = William C.\n| author-link1          = William C.

At that time the [[Western Hemisphere]] in general was unknown to most Europeans, although it had been discovered between the years 800 and 1000 by the [[vikings]]. Following the discovery of the islands by Columbus, the area was quickly colonized by several Western cultures (initially [[Spain#Imperial Spain|Spain]], then later [[England#Early Modern|England]], the [[History of the Netherlands#The Dutch in the Americas|Dutch Republic]], [[French colonial empire#The Americas|France]], [[Couronian colonization of the Americas|Courland]] and [[Danish colonization of the Americas#West Indies|Denmark]]). Following the colonization of the Caribbean islands, the Caribbean Sea became a busy area for European-based marine trading and transports, and this commerce eventually attracted [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]] such as [[Samuel Bellamy]] and [[Blackbeard]].\n\n{{As of | 2015}} the area is home to 22 island [[territories]] and borders 12 continental [[countries]].\n\n==Extent==\nThe [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Caribbean Sea as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf|title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition|year=1953|publisher=International Hydrographic Organization|accessdate=7 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n::''On the North.''

From Galera Point through Trinidad to Galeota Point (Southeast extreme) and thence to Baja Point ({{coord|9|32|N|61|0|W|display=inline}}) in [[Venezuela]].\n\nNote that, although [[Barbados]] is an island on the same continental shelf, it is considered to be in the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Caribbean Sea.\n\n==Geology==\nThe Caribbean Sea is an oceanic sea largely situated on the [[Caribbean Plate]]. The Caribbean Sea is separated from the ocean by several [[island arc]]s of various ages. The youngest stretches from the [[Lesser Antilles]] to the [[Virgin Islands]] to the north east of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] off the coast of [[Venezuela]]. This arc was formed by the collision of the [[South American Plate]] with the [[Caribbean Plate]] and includes active and extinct [[volcanoes]] such as [[Mount Pelee]], [[the Quill (volcano)]] on [[Sint Eustatius]] in the [[Caribbean Netherlands]] and [[Morne Trois Pitons]] on [[Dominica]]. The larger islands in the northern part of the sea [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]], [[Jamaica]] and [[Puerto Rico]] lie on an older island arc.\n\nThe geological age of the Caribbean Sea is estimated to be between 160 and 180&nbsp;million years and was formed by a horizontal fracture that split the [[supercontinent]] called [[Pangea]] in the [[Mesozoic Era]].<ref>Iturralde-Vinent, Manuel (2004), The first inhabitants of the Caribbean , Cuban Science Network . URL accessed on 28/07/2007</ref> It is assumed the proto-caribbean basin existed in the [[Devonian]] period. In the early [[Carboniferous]] movement of [[Gondwana]] to the north and its convergence with the [[Euramerica]] basin decreased in size. The next stage of the Caribbean Sea's formation began in the [[Triassic]]. Powerful [[rifting]] led to the formation of narrow troughs, stretching from modern [[Newfoundland]] to the west coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] which formed [[siliciclastic]] [[sedimentary rock]]s. In the early [[Jurassic]] due to powerful [[marine transgression]], water broke into the present area of the [[Gulf of Mexico]] creating a vast shallow pool. The emergence of deep basins in the Caribbean occurred during the [[Middle Jurassic]] [[rifting]]. The emergence of these basins marked the beginning of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and contributed to the destruction of [[Pangaea]] at the end of the late [[Jurassic]]. During the [[Cretaceous]] the Caribbean acquired the shape close to that seen today. In the early [[Paleogene]] due to [[Marine regression]] the Caribbean became separated from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] by the land of [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The Caribbean remained like this for most of the [[Cenozoic]] until the [[Holocene]] when rising water levels of the oceans restored communication with the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n[[File:Caribbean Sea Gulf of Mexico shaded relief bathymetry land map.png|thumb|The [[Terrain cartography|shaded relief]] map of the Caribbean Sea and [[Gulf of Mexico]] area.<ref name=\"GLOBE\" /><ref name=\"ETOPO1\" />]]\nThe Caribbean's floor is composed of sub-oceanic [[sediments]] of [[deep red clay]] in the deep basins and troughs. On continental slopes and ridges [[calcareous]] [[silt]]s are found. [[Clay minerals]] likely having been deposited by the mainland river [[Orinoco]] and the [[Magdalena River]]. Deposits on the bottom of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico have a thickness of about {{cvt|1|km}}. Upper sedimentary layers relate to the period from the [[Mesozoic]] to the [[Cenozoic]] (250&nbsp;million years ago to present) and the lower layers from the [[Paleozoic]] to the [[Mesozoic]].\n\nThe Caribbean sea floor is divided into five [[Oceanic basin|basins]] separated from each other by underwater ridges and mountain ranges. Atlantic Ocean water enters the Caribbean through the ''Anegada Passage'' lying between the [[Lesser Antilles]] and [[Virgin Islands]] and the ''Windward Passage'' located between [[Cuba]] and [[Haiti]]. The [[Yucat\u00e1n Channel]] between Mexico and Cuba links the [[Gulf of Mexico]] with the Caribbean. The deepest points of the sea lie in [[Cayman Trough]] with depths reaching approximately {{cvt|7686|m|-1}}. Despite this, the Caribbean Sea is considered a relatively shallow sea in comparison to other bodies of water.[[File:Caribbean Ocean view from Bodden Town.jpg|thumb|left|Caribbean Sea view from [[Bodden Town (village)|Bodden Town]], [[Grand Cayman]]]]\n[[File:Caribbean plate tectonics-en.png|thumb|Caribbean plate tectonics]]\n\nThe pressure of the [[South American Plate]] to the east of the Caribbean causes the region of the [[Lesser Antilles]] to have high volcanic activity. There was a very serious eruption of [[Mount Pel\u00e9e]] in 1902 which caused many casualties.\n\nThe Caribbean sea floor is also home to two [[oceanic trench]]es: the [[Cayman Trench]] and [[Puerto Rico Trench]], which put the area at a high risk of [[earthquake]]s. Underwater earthquakes pose a threat of generating [[tsunami]]s which could have a devastating effect on the Caribbean islands. Scientific data reveals that over the last 500 years the area has seen a dozen earthquakes above 7.5 magnitude.<ref>{{cite web | last = Dawicki | first = Shelley | url = http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=3964 | title = Tsunamis in the Caribbean?

Over the past fifty years the Caribbean has gone through three stages: cooling until 1974; a cold phase with peaks during 1974\u20131976 and 1984\u20131986 then; a warming phase with an increase in temperature of {{cvt|0.6|C-change}} per year.

Coral reefs support some of the most diverse marine habitats in the world, but they are fragile ecosystems. When tropical waters become unusually warm for extended periods of time, microscopic plants called [[zooxanthellae]], which are symbiotic partners living within the coral polyp tissues, die off. These plants provide food for the corals, and give them their color. The result of the death and dispersal of these tiny plants is called [[coral bleaching]], and can lead to the devastation of large areas of reef. Over 42% of corals are completely bleached and 95% are experiencing some type of whitening.<ref>[http://www.ipsnews.net/2012/03/mesoamerican-coral-reef-on-the-way-to-becoming-a-marine-desert/] Inter Press Service News Agency \u2013 Mesoamerican Coral Reef on the way to becoming a Marine Desert</ref> Historically the Caribbean is thought to contain 14% of the world's coral reefs.<ref>Elder, Danny and Pernetta, John.

A series of low pressure systems develop off the West coast of Africa and make their way across the Atlantic Ocean. While most of these systems do not become tropical storms, some do. The tropical storms can develop into [[North Atlantic tropical cyclone|Atlantic hurricanes]], often in the low pressure areas of the eastern Caribbean. The Caribbean hurricane season as a whole lasts from June through November, with the majority of hurricanes occurring during August and September. On average around 9 tropical storms form each year, with 5 reaching hurricane strength. According to the [[National Hurricane Center]] 385 hurricanes occurred in the Caribbean between 1494 and 1900.\n\nEvery year hurricanes represent a potential threat to the islands of the Caribbean, due to the extremely destructive nature of these powerful weather systems. Coral reefs can easily be damaged by violent wave action, and can be destroyed when a hurricane dumps sand or mud onto a reef. When this happens, the coral organisms are smothered and the reef dies and ultimately breaks apart.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nThe region has a high level of [[biodiversity]] and many species are [[endemic]] to the Caribbean.\n\n===Vegetation===\nThe vegetation of the region is mostly [[tropical]] but differences in [[topography]], soil and climatic conditions increase [[species diversity]]. Where there are porous limestone terraced islands these are generally poor in nutrients. It is estimated that 13,000 species of plants grow in the Caribbean of which 6,500 are [[endemic]]. For example, guaiac wood (''[[Guaiacum officinale]]''), the flower of which is the national flower of [[Jamaica]] and the Bayahibe rose (''[[Pereskia quisqueyana]]'') which is the national flower of the [[Dominican Republic]] and the [[ceiba]] which is the national tree of both [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Guatemala]]. The [[mahogany]] is the national tree of the Dominican Republic and [[Belize]]. The caimito (''[[Chrysophyllum cainito]]'') grows throughout the Caribbean. In coastal zones there are [[coconut palms]] and in [[lagoons]] and [[estuaries]] are found thick areas of [[Avicennia germinans|black mangrove]] and red mangrove (''[[Rhizophora mangle]]'').\n\nIn shallow water [[flora]] and [[fauna]] is concentrated around [[coral reefs]] where there is little variation in water temperature, purity and salinity. Leeward side of [[lagoons]] provide areas of growth for [[sea grass]]es. Turtle grass (''[[Thalassia testudinum]]'') is common in the Caribbean as is manatee grass (''[[Syringodium filiforme]]'') which can grow together as well as in fields of single species at depths up to {{cvt|20|m}}. Another type shoal grass (''[[Halodule wrightii]]'') grows on sand and mud surfaces at depths of up to {{cvt|5|m}}. In [[brackish water]] of harbours and estuaries at depths less than {{cvt|2.5|m}} widgeongrass (''[[Ruppia maritima]]'') grows. Representatives of three species belonging to the genus ''[[Halophila]]'', (''[[Halophila baillonii]]'', ''[[Halophila engelmannii]]'' and ''[[Halophila decipiens]]'') are found at depths of up to {{cvt|30|m}} except for ''Halophila engelmani'' which does not grow below {{cvt|5|m}} and is confined to the [[Bahamas]], [[Florida]], the [[Greater Antilles]] and the western part of the Caribbean.

Throughout the Caribbean there is industrial catching of [[lobster]] and [[sardines]] (off the coast of [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]).\n\nThere are 90 species of [[mammal]]s in the Caribbean including [[sperm whale]]s, [[humpback whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s. The island of [[Jamaica]] is home to [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[manatees]]. The [[Caribbean monk seal]] which lived in the Caribbean is considered extinct. The [[solenodon]] is [[endangered]].\n\nThere are 500 species of [[reptile]]s (94% of which are [[endemic]]). Islands are inhabited by some endemic species such as [[Cyclura|rock iguanas]] and [[American crocodile]]. The [[blue iguana]], endemic to the island of [[Grand Cayman]], is endangered. The [[green iguana]] is invasive to [[Grand Cayman]].  The [[Mona ground iguana]] which inhabits the island of [[Mona, Puerto Rico]], is endangered. The [[rhinoceros iguana]] from the island of [[Hispaniola]] which is shared between [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] is also endangered. The region has several types of [[sea turtle]] ([[Loggerhead sea turtle|loggerhead]], [[green turtle]], [[hawksbill]], [[leatherback turtle]], [[Atlantic ridley]] and [[olive ridley sea turtle|olive ridley]]).

The [[Caribbean Tourism Organization]] calculates that about 12&nbsp;million people a year visit the area, including (in 1991\u20131992) about 8&nbsp;million cruise ship tourists. Tourism based upon [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]] on [[coral reefs]] of many Caribbean islands makes a major contribution to their economies.<ref>[http://www.wri.org/publication/content/7909 Reefs at Risk in the Caribbean: Economic Valuation Methodology] World Resources Institute 2009.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{In popular culture|date=January 2018}}\nThe Caribbean is the setting for countless literary efforts often related to [[piracy]] acts and [[swashbuckling]], set during the 17th and 18th centuries. One memorable work of pulp fiction has in its title a geographic feature unique in its way to the islands: ''[[Fear Cay]]'', the eleventh [[Doc Savage]] adventure by [[Lester Dent]]. Many [[James Bond]] adventures were set there. It is also well known as the location of the [[Pirates of the Caribbean films]], featuring [[Port Royal]]. [[Peter Matthiessen]]'s ''Far Tortuga'' (1975) chronicles the adventures of a turtling crew in the late 1960s.\n\n[[File:St Thomas.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Thomas, US Virgin Islands]]]]\n[[File:Vieques SunBayBeach.jpg|thumb|[[Vieques]], [[Puerto Rico]]]]\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Geography|Oceans|Caribbean}}\n* [[Piracy in the Caribbean]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of the Caribbean]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Cayo_de_Agua,_Archipi%C3%A9lago_de_Los_Roques,_Venezuela.jpg|Cayo de Agua in [[Los Roques archipelago]], [[Venezuela]]\nFile:Anguilla-aerial view western portion.jpg|The [[Anguilla]] island.\nFile:Jamaica sunrise.JPG|Sunrise over the south beach of [[Jamaica]]\nFile:Johny Cay.jpg|the [[San Andr\u00e9s (island)|island of San Andr\u00e9s]]\nFile:Westbay2106.jpg|[[Roat\u00e1n]], [[Bay Islands, Honduras|Bay Islands]], [[Honduras]]\nFile:Cayol2.jpg|[[Cayo Largo del Sur|Cayo Largo]], [[Cuba]]\nFile:Marie Galante - on the beach (407689602).jpg|[[Marie Galante]], [[Guadeloupe]]\nFile:Scotts Head Dominica.JPG|Scotts Head, [[Dominica]]\nFile:Great Blue Hole.jpg|[[Great Blue Hole]] off the coast of Belize\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em |refs=\n\n<ref name=\"GLOBE\">National Geophysical Data Center, 1999.

His father, Reverend and Minister of [[Glendaruel]] John Maclaurin, died when Maclaurin was in infancy, and his mother died before he reached nine years of age. He was then educated under the care of his uncle, the Reverend Daniel Maclaurin, minister of Kilfinan.\n\n==Academic career==\nAt eleven, Maclaurin entered the [[University of Glasgow]]. He graduated MA three years later by defending a thesis on ''the Power of Gravity,'' and remained at Glasgow to study [[Divinity (academic discipline)|divinity]] until he was 19, when he was elected professor of [[mathematics]] in a ten-day competition at the [[Marischal College]] in the [[University of Aberdeen]]. This record as the world's youngest professor endured until March 2008, when the record was officially given to [[Alia Sabur]].<ref name=\"theind\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/university-appoints-child-prodigy-worlds-youngest-professor-818776.html|title=University appoints world's youngest professor|publisher=The Independent|author=David McNeill|date=1 May 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the vacations of 1719 and 1721, Maclaurin went to London, where he became acquainted with Sir [[Isaac Newton]], [[Benjamin Hoadly (physician)|Dr Benjamin Hoadly]], [[Samuel Clarke]], [[Martin Folkes]], and other philosophers. He was admitted a member of the [[Royal Society]].\n\nIn 1722, having provided a substitute for his class at Aberdeen, he travelled on the Continent as tutor to George Hume, the son of [[Alexander Hume, 2nd Earl of Marchmont]]. During their time in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], he wrote his essay on the percussion of bodies (''Demonstration des loix du choc des corps''), which gained the prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences]] in 1724. Upon the death of his pupil at [[Montpellier]], Maclaurin returned to Aberdeen.\n\nIn 1725, Maclaurin was appointed deputy to the mathematical professor at [[Edinburgh]], James Gregory (brother of [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] and nephew of the esteemed [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]]), upon the recommendation of [[Isaac Newton]]. On 3 November of that year Maclaurin succeeded Gregory, and went on to raise the character of that university as a school of science. Newton was so impressed with Maclaurin that he had offered to pay his salary himself.\n\n==Contributions to mathematics==\n[[File:Acta Eruditorum - I monete geometria, 1747 \u2013 BEIC 13417751 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Illustration of critique of ''De fluxionibus libri duo'' published in [[Acta Eruditorum]], 1747]]\nMaclaurin used [[Taylor series]] to characterize maxima, minima, and points of inflection for infinitely differentiable functions in his ''Treatise of Fluxions''.

Clairaut, Euler, Laplace, Legendre, Poisson and Gauss.  Maclaurin showed that an oblate spheroid was a possible equilibrium in Newton's theory of gravity.  The subject continues to be of scientific interest, and Nobel Laureate [[Subramanyan Chandrasekhar]] dedicated a chapter of his book ''Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium'' to Maclaurin spheroids. {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}\n\nIndependently from [[Euler]] and using the same methods, Maclaurin discovered the [[Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula]].  He used it to sum powers of [[arithmetic progression]]s, derive [[Stirling's formula]], and to derive the Newton-Cotes numerical integration formulas which includes [[Simpson's rule]] as a special case. {{harv|Grabiner|1997}}\n\nMaclaurin contributed to the study of [[elliptic integral]]s, reducing many intractable integrals to problems of finding arcs for hyperbolas.  His work was continued by d'Alembert and Euler, who gave a more concise approach.{{harv|Grabiner|1997}}\n\nIn his ''Treatise of Algebra'' (Ch. XII, Sect 86), published in 1748 two years after his death, Maclaurin proved a rule for solving square linear systems in the cases of 2 and 3 unknowns, and discussed the case of 4 unknowns.<ref>{{cite book\n  | last = MacLaurin\n  | first = Colin\n  | title = A Treatise of Algebra, in Three Parts.\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/atreatisealgebr03maclgoog\n  | year = 1748\n}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last=Hedman\n  | first=Bruce\n  |date=November 1999\n  | title=An Earlier Date for \"Cramer's Rule\"\n  | journal=Historia Mathematica\n  | volume=26\n  | issue=4\n  | pages=365\u2013368\n  | publisher=Academic Press Elsevier\n  | format=\n  | doi=10.1006/hmat.1999.2247\n  | jstor = }}</ref>  This publication preceded by two years [[Gabriel Cramer|Cramer]]'s publication of a generalization of the rule to ''n'' unknowns, now commonly known as [[Cramer's rule]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Colin MacLaurin Road, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|Colin MacLaurin Road, Edinburgh]]\nIn 1733, Maclaurin married Anne Stewart, the daughter of Walter Stewart, the [[Solicitor General for Scotland]], by whom he had seven children.

They omit the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s because the positions of these bodies vary relative to those of the stars, but the [[ecliptic]], along which the Sun moves, is indicated.\n\nThere is an issue regarding the \u201c[[chirality|handedness]]\u201d of celestial globes. If the globe is constructed so that the stars are in the positions they actually occupy on the imaginary [[celestial sphere]], then the star field will appear back-to-front on the surface of the globe (all the constellations will appear as their mirror images). This is because the view from [[Earth]], positioned at the centre of the celestial sphere, is of the [[Gnomonic projection|''inside'' of the celestial sphere]], whereas the celestial globe is [[Orthographic projection (cartography)|viewed from the ''outside'']]. For this reason, celestial globes are often produced in mirror image, so that at least the [[constellation]]s appear the \u201cright way round\u201d. Some modern celestial globes address this problem by making the surface of the globe [[transparency and translucency|transparent]]. The stars can then be placed in their proper positions and viewed ''through'' the globe, so that the view is of the inside of the celestial sphere. However, the proper position from which to view the sphere would be from its centre, but the viewer of a transparent globe must be outside it, far from its centre. Viewing the inside of the sphere from the outside, through its transparent surface, produces serious distortions. [[Opacity (optics)|Opaque]] celestial globes that are made with the constellations correctly placed, so they appear as mirror images when directly viewed from outside the globe, are often viewed in a mirror, so the constellations have their familiar appearances. Written material on the globe, e.g. constellation names, is printed in reverse, so it can easily be read in the mirror.{{cn|date=October 2016}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Armillary sphere]]\n\n\n[[Category:Globes]]\n[[Category:Navigational equipment]]\n[[Category:Spheres]]", "sha1": "6k2gmm6zes847oilpb1jrggtuxnm4fo"}}, {"title": "Covenant-breaker", "ns": "0", "id": "7827", "revision": {"id": "809889814", "parentid": "802458103", "timestamp": "2017-11-12T03:44:18Z", "contributor": {"username": "Goustien", "id": "4440889"}, "comment": "{{Bah\u00e1'\u00ed}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{lead rewrite|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n{{Bah\u00e1'\u00ed sidebar}}\n'''Covenant-breaker''' is a term used by [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith|Bah\u00e1'\u00eds]] to refer to a person who has been [[Excommunication|excommunicated]] from the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community for the act of '''covenant-breaking,''' roughly defined as active opposition to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith from a current member. According to [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed laws|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed law,]] only the head of the religion, currently the [[Universal House of Justice]], has the authority to declare a person a covenant-breaker.  \n\nA person may be declared a covenant-breaker for actions which are seen as challenging the unity of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community, not for personal matters such as failure to obey Bah\u00e1'\u00ed law or conversion to another religion. \n\nWhen a person is a declared a covenant-breaker all Bah\u00e1'\u00eds are expected to avoid unnecessary association with that person. \n\n==Definition==\nCovenant-breaking does not refer to attacks from non-Bah\u00e1'\u00eds or former Baha'is. Rather, it is in reference to internal campaigns of opposition where the Covenant-breaker is seen as challenging the unity of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith, causing internal division, or by claiming or supporting an alternate succession of authority or administrative structure. The central purpose of the covenant is to prevent schism and dissension.<ref name=\"bahai-library1\">[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant Covenant, The, and Covenant-breaker<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nIn a letter to an individual dated 23 March 1975, the Universal House of Justice wrote:\n{{quote|When a person declares his acceptance of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h as a Manifestation of God he becomes a party to the Covenant and accepts the totality of His Revelation. If he then turns round and attacks Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h or the Central Institution of the Faith he violates the Covenant. If this happens every effort is made to help that person to see the illogicality and error of his actions, but if he persists he must, in accordance with the instructions of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h Himself, be shunned as a Covenant-breaker.}}\n\nThe term 'Covenant-breaker' or, in Arabic 'naqid al-mithaq' [pl. Naqidu 'l-mithaq], was first used by [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] to describe the partisans of his brother [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad `Al\u00ed]], who challenged his leadership.  In `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1's [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1|Will and Testament]], He appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the ''[[Guardian (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith)|Guardian]]'' of the religion and called for the eventual election of the [[Universal House of Justice]], and defined in the same manner opposition to these two institutions as Covenant-Breaking.  `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 advised all Bah\u00e1'\u00eds to shun anyone opposing the Covenant: \"...one of the greatest and most fundamental principles of the Cause of God is to shun and avoid entirely the Covenant-breakers, for they will utterly destroy the Cause of God, exterminate His Law and render of no account all efforts exerted in the past.\"<ref>''The Will And Testament of \u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1'', [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/WT/wt-2.html#gr10 p 20]</ref>\n\n==Categorization==\n\n=== Included categories of people ===\nMost Covenant-breakers are involved in schismatic groups, but not always.  For example, a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed who refuses to follow guidance on treatment of Covenant-breakers is at risk of being named one. One article<ref>[http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_covenant The Covenant, and Covenant-breaker], by [[Moojan Momen]]</ref> originally written for the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Encyclopedia, characterized Covenant-breakers that have emerged in the course of Bah\u00e1'\u00ed history as belonging to one of four categories:\n\n#Leadership challenge: These are persons who dispute the authority and legitimacy of the head of the religion and advance claims either for themselves or for another. The main examples of these are [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad `Al\u00ed]] and [[Mason Remey|Charles Mason Remey]].\n#Dissidence: Those who actively disagree with the policies and actions of the head of the faith without, however, advancing an alternative claim for leadership. This group consisted mostly of opponents of the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed administration such as [[Ruth White (Bah\u00e1'\u00ed author)|Ruth White]] and [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]].\n#Disobedience: Those who disobey certain direct instructions from the head of the religion.  Mostly the instruction in question is to cease to associate with a Covenant-breaker. Examples of this type include most of the descendants of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 during Shoghi Effendi's time.\n#Apostates who maliciously attack the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith. Examples include [[Abd al-Hosayn Ayati|\u00c1v\u00e1rih]] and [[N\u00edk\u00fa]].\n\n=== Excluded categories of people ===\nShoghi Effendi wrote to the National Spiritual Assembly of Canada in 1957:\n{{quote|People who have withdrawn from the Cause because they no longer feel that they can support its Teachings and Institutions sincerely, are not Covenant-breakers -- they are non-Bah\u00e1'\u00eds and should just be treated as such. Only those who ally themselves actively with known enemies of the Faith who are Covenant-breakers, and who attack the Faith in the same spirit as these people, can be considered, themselves, to be Covenant-breakers.<ref>Shoghi Effendi, Messages to Canada, p. 64</ref>}}\n\nBeyond this, many other relationships to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith exist, both positive and negative.  Covenant-breaking does not apply to most of them. The following is a partial list of those who could not rightly be termed Covenant-breakers:\n\n* Members of other religions or no religion--with or without any particular relationship to the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith.\n* Bah\u00e1'\u00eds who simply leave the religion. (see above)\n* Bah\u00e1'\u00eds who, in the estimation of the head of the religion have insufficiently understood the nature of the covenant from the start.  These are sometimes \"disenrolled\" and are considered to have never actually been Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, given their fundamental diversion from this core Bah\u00e1'\u00ed doctrine.\n\n===B\u00e1b\u00eds===\n[[B\u00e1b\u00eds]] are generally regarded as another religion altogether. Since Covenant-breaking presumes that one has submitted oneself to a covenant and then broken it, and B\u00e1b\u00eds never recognized or swore allegiance to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, they are not Covenant-breakers.\n\nFollowers of [[Subh-i-Azal]], Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's half-brother who tried to poison him, engaged in active opposition to Bah\u00e1'\u00eds, and Shoghi Effendi did inform Bah\u00e1'\u00eds that they should avoid contact with his descendants, writing that \"No intelligent and loyal Baha'i would associate with a descendant of Azal, if he traced the slightest breath of criticism of our Faith, in any aspect, from that person. In fact these people should be strenuously avoided as having an inherited spiritual disease -- the disease of Covenant-breaking!\".<ref>Shoghi Effendi, From letter dated 9 December 1948 to an individual believer</ref>\n\n==Covenant-breaking in Shoghi Effendi's immediate family==\nThrough the influence of [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's family|Bahiyyih Khanum]], the eldest daughter of [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], everyone in the household initially rallied around [[Shoghi Effendi]] after the death of [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]]. For several years his brother Husayn and several cousins served him as secretaries. The only ones publicly opposing him were [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad `Al\u00ed]] and his followers, who were declared Covenant-breakers by `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1. Contrary to `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1's specific instruction, certain family members established illicit links with those whom `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 had declared Covenant-breakers. After Bahiyyih Khanum died in 1932, Shoghi Effendi's eldest sister \u2013 Ruhangiz \u2013 married a son of [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's family|Siyyid Ali Afnan]].  Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's son-in-law was, thus, a long-standing enemy of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (who had declared him a Covenant-breaker.) Through Ruhangiz's efforts, Shoghi Effendi's other sister and his cousin Thurayya also married sons of Siyyid Ali Afnan. Presumably being faced with a choice between shunning their disobedient family members and being themselves disobedient to `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi, his cousins, aunts and uncles chose the latter.\n\n===Ruhi Afnan===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ruhi Afnan.jpeg|thumb|Shoghi Effendi (sitting) and Ruhi Afnan (standing)]] -->\n\nAfter years of silence on these developments, cables sent by [[Shoghi Effendi]] on November 2, 1941 provide background to developments among family members. Ruhi Afnan, Shoghi Effendi's cousin through [[`Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]]'s daughter Tuba:\n\n* \"Ruhi's sister married Covenant-breaker Faydi whose mother joined and supported arch-enemy Muhammad-`Ali and whose father `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 denounced openly and repeatedly as His deadly enemy.

Furughiyyih and her children all supported [[M\u00edrz\u00e1 Muhammad `Al\u00ed]]. Faydi had two elder brothers. Hussein Effendi Afnan was aide-de-camp to [[Faisal II of Iraq]] and Nayyer Effendi Afnan was Commissioner of Parks in Cairo, Egypt. The entire Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Family was stigmatized by Shoghi Effendi as Covenant-breakers as he was displeased with their marriages.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sohrab |first=Ahmad|authorlink=Ahmad Sohrab |title=Abdul Baha's Grandson Story of a Twentieth Century Excommunication |page = 166   |url=https://www.abebooks.com/Abdul-Bahas-Grandson-Story-Twentieth-Century/18337084751/bd |publisher= Universal Publishing Company, New York |date= 1943}}</ref>\n\nThen in a 1950 cable:\n\n* \"Inform friends that Ruhi, his mother, with Ruha, his aunt, and their families, not content with years of disobedience and unworthy conduct, are now showing open defiance.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Effendi |first=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi||date=February 22, 2015 |title=Citadel of Faith  |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/CF/cf-6.html#pg87 |publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform |page=87 |isbn=978-1508530596}}</ref> (''Citadel of Faith'', p.&nbsp;87)\n\nAnd in 1953:\n\n* \"Treacherous Ruhi Afnan, not content with previous disobedience, correspondence with [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]], contact with old Covenant-breakers, sale, in conjunction with other members of family, of sacred property purchased by Founder of Faith, and allowing his sister to marry son of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1's enemy, is now openly lecturing on Bah\u00e1'\u00ed movement, claiming to be its exponent and is misrepresenting the teachings and deliberately causing confusion in minds of authorities and the local population.

The [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1]] states that Guardians should be [[lineal primogeniture|lineal descendant]]s of [[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], that each Guardian must select his successor during his lifetime, and that the nine [[Hands of the Cause of God]] permanently stationed in the [[holy land]] must approve the appointment by majority vote.  Bah\u00e1'\u00eds interpret lineal descendency to mean physical familial relation to Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, of which Mason Remey was not.\n\nAlmost all of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds accepted the determination of the [[Hands of the Cause]] that upon the death of Shoghi Effendi, he died \"without having appointed his successor\". There was an absence of a valid descendant of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h who could qualify under the terms of `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1's will. Later the [[Universal House of Justice]], initially elected in 1963, made a ruling on the subject that it was not possible for another Guardian to be appointed.\n\nIn 1960 Remey, a Hand of the Cause himself, retracted his earlier position, and claimed to have been coerced.  He claimed to be the successor to Shoghi Effendi.  He and the small number of people who followed him were expelled from the Faith by the Hands of the Cause. Those close to Remey claimed that he went senile in old age, and by the time of his death he was largely abandoned, with his most prominent followers fighting amongst themselves for leadership.\n\nThe largest group of the remaining followers of Remey, members of the so called \"[[Orthodox Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]\", believe that legitimate authority passed from Shoghi Effendi to Mason Remey to Joel Marangella. They, therefore, regard the Universal House of Justice in Haifa, Israel to be illegitimate, and its members and followers to be Covenant-breakers.\n\nThe present descendants of expelled members of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h's family have not specifically been declared Covenant-breakers, though they mostly do not associate themselves with the Bah\u00e1'\u00ed religion.\n\nA small group of Bah\u00e1'\u00eds in Northern New Mexico believe that these descendants are eligible for appointment to the Guardianship and are waiting for such a direct descendant of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h to arise as the rightful Guardian.\n\nThere is also a small group in Montana, originally inspired by Leland Jensen, who claimed a status higher than that of the Guardian.

The money was returned the next day in front of the press. Prior to the incident, the system provider had failed to react to proof of the security flaw provided by the CCC, claiming to the public that their system was safe. Bildschirmtext was the biggest commercially available online system targeted at the general public in its region at that time, run and heavily advertised by the German telecommunications agency [[Deutsche Bundespost]] which also strove to keep up-to-date alternatives out of the market.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Karl Koch ===\n{{main|Karl Koch (hacker)}}\nIn 1987, the CCC was peripherally involved in the first [[cyberespionage]] case to make international headlines.  A group of [[West Germany|German]] hackers led by [[Hagbard (Karl Koch)|Karl Koch]], who was loosely affiliated with the CCC, was arrested for breaking into US government and corporate computers, and then selling operating-system source code to the Soviet [[KGB]].\nThis incident was portrayed in the movie ''[[23 (film)|23]]''.\n\n=== GSM-Hack ===\nIn April 1998, the CCC successfully demonstrated the cloning of a [[GSM]] customer card, breaking the [[COMP128]] [[encryption]] algorithm used at that time by many GSM [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]]s.<ref>[http://www.ccc.de/gsm/ CCC | CCC klont D2 Kundenkarte<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530204651/http://www.ccc.de/gsm/ |date=May 30, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Project Blinkenlights ===\n[[File:Blinkenlights_CCC_at_22C3.jpg|thumb|Blinkenlights at the 22nd Chaos Communication Congress]]\n{{main|Project Blinkenlights}}\nIn 2001, the CCC celebrated its twentieth birthday with an interactive light installation dubbed ''Project Blinkenlights'' that turned the building [[Haus des Lehrers]] in Berlin into a giant computer screen.

This \"source wiretapping\" is the only feasible way to wiretap in this case, since Internet telephony programs will usually [[encryption|encrypt]] the data when it leaves the computer. The [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] has ruled that the police may only use such programs for telephony wiretapping, and for no other purpose, and that this restriction should be enforced through technical and legal means.\n\nOn October 8, 2011, the CCC published an analysis of the Staatstrojaner software. The software was found to have the ability to remote control the target computer, to capture [[screenshots]], and to fetch and run arbitrary extra code. The CCC says that having this functionality built in is in direct contradiction to the ruling of the constitutional court.\n\nIn addition, there were a number of security problems with the implementation. The software was controllable over the Internet, but the commands were sent completely un[[encrypted]], with no checks for authentication or integrity. This leaves any computer under surveillance using this software vulnerable to attack. The captured screenshots and audio files were encrypted, but so incompetently that the encryption was ineffective. All captured data was sent over a proxy server in the United States, which is problematic since the data is then temporarily outside the German [[jurisdiction]].\n\nThe CCC's findings were widely reported in the German press.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.de/en/updates/2011/staatstrojaner|title=Chaos Computer Club analyzes government malware|date=2011-10-08|accessdate=2011-10-10|publisher=Chaos Computer Club}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/netzpolitik/0,1518,790756,00.html|title=CCC findet Sicherheitsl\u00fccken in Bundestrojaner|work=[[Der Spiegel]] |accessdate=2011-10-10|date=2011-10-09}}</ref><ref name=\"spiegel\">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,790944,00.html|title=Electronic Surveillance Scandal Hits Germany|work=Der Spiegel|accessdate=2011-10-31|date=2011-10-10}}</ref> This trojan has also been nicknamed [[R2-D2]]<ref name=\"cupa\">Basil Cupa, [http://www.zora.uzh.ch/81157/1/Cupa_Living_in_Surveillance_Societies_2012.pdf Trojan Horse Resurrected: On the Legality of the Use of Government Spyware (Govware)], LISS 2013, pp. 419-428</ref><ref>[http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/101911-german-federal-trojan-eavesdrops-on-252153.html German federal Trojan eavesdrops on 15 applications, experts find.

In a [[social context]], a convention may retain the character of an \"unwritten law\" of custom (for example, the manner in which people greet each other, such as by shaking each other's hands).\n\nIn [[physical science]]s, numerical values (such as constants, quantities, or scales of measurement) are called conventional if they do not represent a measured property of nature, but originate in a convention, for example an average of many measurements, agreed between the scientists working with these values.\n\n== General ==\nA convention is a selection from among two or more alternatives, where the rule or alternative is agreed upon among participants. Often the word refers to unwritten customs shared throughout a community. For instance, it is conventional in many societies that strangers being introduced shake hands. Some conventions are explicitly legislated; for example, it is conventional in the [[United States]] and in [[Germany]] that motorists [[Driving on the left or right|drive on the right]] side of the road, whereas in [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] motorists drive on the left. The standardization of time is a human convention based on the solar cycle or calendar. The extent to which [[justice]] is conventional (as opposed to [[Naturalism (philosophy)|natural]] or [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]) is historically an important debate among [[philosopher]]s.\n\nThe nature of conventions has raised long-lasting philosophical discussion. [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]], [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]], and [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]] published influential writings on the subject. Lewis's account of convention received an extended critique in [[Margaret Gilbert]]'s ''On Social Facts'' (1989), where an alternative account is offered. Another view of convention comes from [[Ruth Millikan]]'s ''Language:  A Biological Model'' (2005), once more against Lewis.{{example needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nAccording to David Kalupahana, [[Gotama Buddha|The Buddha]] described conventions\u2014whether linguistic, social, political, moral, ethical, or even religious\u2014as [[Dependent arising|arising dependent]] on specific conditions. According to his paradigm, when conventions are considered absolute realities, they contribute to dogmatism, which in turn leads to conflict. This does not mean that conventions should be absolutely ignored as unreal and therefore useless. Instead, according to Buddhist thought, a wise person adopts a [[middle way]] without holding conventions to be ultimate or ignoring them when they are fruitful.<ref>[[David Kalupahana]], ''Nagarjuna: The Philosophy of the Middle Way.'' SUNY Press, 1986, pages 17-18. The author refers specifically to the thought of the Buddha here.</ref>\n\n== Customary or social conventions ==\n\n=== Social ===\n{{Main|Norm (social)|Mores|Norm (philosophy)|taboo}}\nIn [[sociology]] a ''social rule'' refers to any social convention commonly adhered to in a [[society]]. These ''rules'' are not written in [[law]] or otherwise formalized. In [[social constructionism]] there is a great focus on social rules. It is argued that these rules are socially constructed, that these rules act upon every member of a society, but at the same time, are re-produced by the individuals.\n\nSociologists representing [[symbolic interactionism]] argue that social rules are created through the interaction between the members of a society. The focus on active interaction highlights the fluid, shifting character of social rules. These are specific to the social context, a context that varies through time and place. That means a social rule changes over time within the same society. What was acceptable in the past may no longer be the case. Similarly, rules differ across space: what is acceptable in one society may not be so in another.\n\nSocial rules reflect what is ''acceptable'' or ''normal'' behaviour in any situation. [[Michel Foucault]]'s concept of [[discourse]] is closely related to social rules as it offers a possible explanation how these rules are shaped and change. It is the social rules that tell people what is ''normal'' behaviour for any specific category. Thus, social rules tell a woman how to behave in a [[Femininity|womanly]] manner, and a man, how to be [[Masculinity|manly]]. Other such rules are as follows:\n\n*Strangers being introduced shake hands, as in Western societies, but\n**[[Bowing (social)|Bow]] toward each other, in [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[China]]\n**''Do not'' bow at each other, in the Jewish tradition\n**In the United States, eye contact, a nod of the head toward each other, and a smile, with no bowing; the palm of the hand faces sideways, neither upward nor downward, in a business handshake.\n**Present business cards to each other, in business meetings (both-handed in [[Japan]])\n*Click heels together, in past eras of Western history{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n*A woman's [[curtsey]], in some societies\n*In the Middle East, never displaying the sole of the foot toward another, as this would be seen as a grave insult.\n*In many schools, though seats for students are not assigned they are still \"claimed\" by certain students, and sitting in someone else's seat is considered an insult\n\n== Government ==\n{{Main|Constitutional convention (political custom)}}\nIn [[Forms of government|government]], convention is a set of unwritten rules that participants in the government must follow. These rules can be ignored only if justification is clear, or can be provided. Otherwise, consequences follow. Consequences may include ignoring some other convention that has until now been followed. According to the traditional doctrine (Dicey){{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}, conventions cannot be enforced in courts, because they are non-legal sets of rules. Convention is particularly important in the [[Westminster System]] of government, where many of the rules are unwritten.\n\n== International law ==\n{{Main|International law}}\nThe term \"convention\" is also used in [[international law]] to refer to certain formal statements of principle such as the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. Conventions are adopted by international bodies such as the [[International Labour Organization]] and the [[United Nations]]. Conventions so adopted usually apply only to countries that ratify them, and do not automatically apply to member states of such bodies. These conventions are generally seen as having the force of international [[treaty|treaties]] for the ratifying countries.

For instance, the set of [[rational number]]s is not complete, because e.g. [[square root of 2|<math>\\sqrt{2}</math>]] is \"missing\" from it, even though one can construct a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers that converges to it. (See the examples below.)  It is always possible to \"fill all the holes\", leading to the ''completion'' of a given space, as explained below.\n\n==Examples==\nThe space '''Q''' of [[rational number]]s, with the standard metric given by the [[absolute value]] of the [[subtraction|difference]], is not complete.  Consider for instance the sequence defined by <math>x_1 \\;=\\; 1</math> and <math>x_{n+1} \\;=\\; \\frac{x_n}{2} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{x_n}</math>.  This is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers, but it does not converge towards any rational limit: If the sequence did have a limit ''x'', then by solving <math>x \\;=\\; \\frac{x}{2} \\,+\\, \\frac{1}{x}</math>  necessarily ''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;2,  yet no rational number has this property. However, considered as a sequence of [[real number]]s, it does converge to the [[irrational number]] <math>\\sqrt{2}</math>.\n\nThe [[interval (mathematics)|open interval]] {{open-open|0,1}}, again with the absolute value metric, is not complete either.  The sequence defined by ''x''<sub>''n''</sub> = {{sfrac|1|''n''}} is Cauchy, but does not have a limit in the given space.  However the [[Closed set|closed]] interval [[unit interval|{{closed-closed|0,1}}]] is complete; for example the given sequence does have a limit in this interval and the limit is zero.\n\nThe space '''R''' of real numbers and the space '''C''' of [[complex number]]s (with the metric given by the absolute value) are complete, and so is [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, with the [[Euclidean distance|usual distance]] metric.  In contrast, infinite-dimensional [[normed vector space]]s may or may not be complete; those that are complete are [[Banach space]]s.  The space C{{closed-closed|''a'',\u2009''b''}} of [[continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space|continuous real-valued functions on a closed and bounded interval]] is a Banach space, and so a complete metric space, with respect to the [[supremum norm]].  However, the supremum norm does not give a norm on the space C{{open-open|''a'',\u2009''b''}} of continuous functions on {{open-open|''a'',\u2009''b''}}, for it may contain unbounded functions.  Instead, with the topology of [[compact convergence]], C{{open-open|''a'',\u2009''b''}} can be given the structure of a [[Fr\u00e9chet space]]: a [[locally convex topological vector space]] whose topology can be induced by a complete translation-invariant metric.\n\nThe space '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] is complete for any [[prime number]] ''p''.  This space completes '''Q''' with the ''p''-adic metric in the same way that '''R''' completes '''Q''' with the usual metric.\n\nIf ''S'' is an arbitrary set, then the set ''S''<sup>'''N'''</sup> of all [[sequence]]s in ''S'' becomes a complete metric space if we define the distance between the sequences (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) and (''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) to be {{sfrac|1|''N''}}, where ''N'' is the smallest index for which ''x''<sub>''N''</sub> is [[Distinct (mathematics)|distinct]] from ''y''<sub>''N''</sub>, or 0 if there is no such index.  This space is [[homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of a [[countable]] number of copies of the [[discrete space]] ''S''.\n\n==Some theorems==\nA metric space ''X'' is complete if and only if every decreasing sequence of non-empty closed subsets of ''X'', with [[Diameter#Generalizations|diameters]] tending to&nbsp;0, has a non-empty intersection: if ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> is closed and non-empty, {{nowrap|''F''<sub>''n''+1</sub> \u2282 ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>}} for every ''n'',  and {{nowrap|diam(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) \u2192 0}}, then there is a point {{nowrap|''x'' \u2208 ''X''}} common to all sets&nbsp;''F''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nEvery [[compact space|compact]] metric space is complete, though complete spaces need not be compact. In fact, a metric space is compact [[if and only if]] it is complete and [[totally bounded]]. This is a generalization of the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]], which states that any closed and bounded subspace ''S'' of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is compact and therefore complete.<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduction to Metric and Topological Spaces |first=Wilson A. |last=Sutherland |isbn=978-0-19-853161-6 }}</ref>\n\nLet {{nowrap|(''X'', ''d'')}} be a complete metric space.

That is, the [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[countable|countably many]] [[nowhere dense]] subsets of the space has [[empty set|empty]] [[interior (topology)|interior]].\n\nThe [[Banach fixed point theorem]] states that a contraction mapping on a complete metric space admits a fixed point. The fixed point theorem is often used to prove the [[inverse function theorem]] on complete metric spaces such as Banach spaces.\n\nThe [[expansion constant]] of a metric space is the [[infimum]] of all constants <math>\\textstyle \\mu</math> such that whenever the family <math>\\textstyle \\left\\{ \\overline{B}(x_\\alpha,\\, r_\\alpha) \\right\\}</math> intersects pairwise, the intersection\n:<math>\\bigcap_\\alpha \\overline{B}(x_\\alpha, \\mu r_\\alpha)</math>\n\nis nonempty. A metric space is complete if and only if its expansion constant is \u2264&nbsp;2.<ref>{{cite journal |first=B. |last=Gr\u00fcnbaum |title=Some applications of expansion constants |journal=[[Pacific Journal of Mathematics|Pacific J.

It has the following [[universal property]]: if ''N'' is any complete metric space and ''f'' is any [[uniformly continuous function]] from ''M'' to ''N'', then there exists a [[unique (mathematics)|unique]] uniformly continuous function ''f\u2032'' from ''M\u2032'' to ''N'', which extends ''f''.  The space ''M''' is determined [[up to]] [[isometry]] by this property, and is called the ''completion'' of ''M''.\n\nThe completion of ''M'' can be constructed as a set of [[equivalence class]]es of Cauchy sequences in ''M''. For any two Cauchy sequences x=(''x''<sub>''n''</sub>) and y=(''y''<sub>''n''</sub>) in ''M'', we may define their distance as\n: <math>d(x, y) = \\lim_n d\\left(x_n, y_n\\right)</math>\n\n(This limit exists because the real numbers are complete.) This is only a [[pseudometric space|pseudometric]], not yet a metric, since two different Cauchy sequences may have the distance 0. But \"having distance 0\" is an [[equivalence relation]] on the set of all Cauchy sequences, and the set of equivalence classes is a metric space, the completion of ''M''.  The original space is embedded in this space via the identification of an element ''x'' of ''M''' with the equivalence class of sequences in ''M'' converging to ''x'' (i.e., the equivalence class containing the sequence with constant value ''x'').  This defines an [[isometry]] onto a dense subspace, as required. Notice, however, that this construction makes explicit use of the completeness of the real numbers, so completion of the rational numbers needs a slightly different treatment.\n\n[[Georg Cantor|Cantor]]'s construction of the real numbers is similar to the above construction; the real numbers are the completion of the rational numbers using the ordinary absolute value to measure distances. The additional subtlety to contend with is that it is not logically permissible to use the completeness of the real numbers in their own construction. Nevertheless, equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences are defined as above, and the set of equivalence classes is easily shown to be a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] that has the rational numbers as a subfield. This field is complete, admits a natural [[total ordering]], and is the unique totally ordered complete field (up to isomorphism).  It is ''defined'' as the field of real numbers (see also [[Construction of the real numbers]] for more details). One way to visualize this identification with the real numbers as usually viewed is that the equivalence class consisting of those Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that \"ought\" to have a given real limit is identified with that real number. The truncations of the decimal expansion give just one choice of Cauchy sequence in the relevant equivalence class.\n\nFor a prime ''p'', the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] arise by completing the rational numbers with respect to a different metric.\n\nIf the earlier completion procedure is applied to a [[normed vector space]], the result is a [[Banach space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace, and if it is applied to an [[inner product space]], the result is a [[Hilbert space]] containing the original space as a dense subspace.\n\n==Topologically complete spaces==\nNote that completeness is a property of the ''metric'' and not of the ''[[topology]]'', meaning that a complete metric space can be [[homeomorphic]] to a non-complete one.  An example is given by the real numbers, which are complete but homeomorphic to the open interval {{open-open|0,1}}, which is not complete.\n\nIn [[topology]] one considers ''[[completely metrizable space]]s'', spaces for which there exists at least one complete metric inducing the given topology.  Completely metrizable spaces can be characterized as those spaces that can be written as an [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of countably many open subsets of some complete metric space. Since the conclusion of the [[Baire category theorem]] is purely topological, it applies to these spaces as well.\n\nCompletely metrizable spaces are often called ''topologically complete''. However, the latter term is somewhat arbitrary since metric is not the most general structure on a topological space for which one can talk about completeness (see the section [[#Alternatives and generalizations|Alternatives and generalizations]]). Indeed, some authors use the term ''topologically complete'' for a wider class of topological spaces, the [[completely uniformizable space]]s.<ref>Kelley, Problem 6.L, p. 208</ref>\n\nA topological space homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space is called a [[Polish space]].\n\n==Alternatives and generalizations==\nSince [[Cauchy sequence]]s can also be defined in general [[topological group]]s, an alternative to relying on a metric structure for defining completeness and constructing the completion of a space is to use a group structure.  This is most often seen in the context of [[topological vector space]]s, but requires only the existence of a continuous \"subtraction\" operation.  In this setting, the distance between two points ''x'' and ''y'' is gauged not by a real number ''\u03b5'' via the metric ''d'' in the comparison ''d''(''x'', ''y'')&nbsp;&lt;&nbsp;''\u03b5'', but by an open neighbourhood ''N'' of 0 via subtraction in the comparison ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA common generalisation of these definitions can be found in the context of a [[uniform space]], where an [[Uniform space#Entourage definition|entourage]] is a set of all pairs of points that are at no more than a particular \"distance\" from each other.\n\nIt is also possible to replace Cauchy ''sequences'' in the definition of completeness by Cauchy ''[[net (mathematics)|nets]]'' or [[filter (mathematics)#Filters in uniform spaces|Cauchy filters]].  If every Cauchy net (or equivalently every Cauchy filter) has a limit in ''X'', then ''X'' is called complete.  One can furthermore construct a completion for an arbitrary uniform space similar to the completion of metric spaces. The most general situation in which Cauchy nets apply is [[Cauchy space]]s; these too have a notion of completeness and completion just like uniform spaces.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Knaster\u2013Tarski theorem]]\n* [[Completion (algebra)]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n* {{Cite book | last=Kelley | first=John L. | title=General Topology | isbn=0-387-90125-6 | publisher=Springer | year=1975}}\n* Kreyszig, Erwin, ''Introductory functional analysis with applications'' (Wiley, New York, 1978). {{ISBN|0-471-03729-X}}\n* Lang, Serge, \"Real and Functional Analysis\" {{ISBN|0-387-94001-4}}\n* {{cite book\n  | last      = Meise\n  | first     = Reinhold\n  | last2     =Vogt \n  | first2    = Dietmar\n  | others=Ramanujan, M.S.

In person, he went by '''Charles Criswell King''', and was sometimes credited as '''Jeron King Criswell'''.\n\nCriswell was flamboyant, with [[Kiss curl|spit curled]] hair, a [[wikt:stentorian|stentorian]] style of speaking, and a [[sequin]]ed [[Black tie|tuxedo]]. He owned a [[coffin]] in which he claimed to sleep. He grew up in a troubled family in [[Indiana]] with relatives who owned a funeral home, and said that he became comfortable with sleeping in caskets in the storeroom. He appeared in two of [[Ed Wood]]'s films.\n\n==Career==\nCriswell said he had once worked as a [[radio announcer]] and news broadcaster. He began buying time on a local Los Angeles television station in the early 1950s to run [[infomercials]] for his Criswell Family Vitamins. To fill the time, he began his \"Criswell Predicts\" part of the show. This made him a minor off-beat celebrity in Los Angeles and around Hollywood, and his friendship with old show-business people such as [[Mae West]] and rising fringe celebrities such as [[Korla Pandit]] made Criswell an entertaining presence at parties. His fame brought him appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show|The Jack Paar Show]]'' (1957\u20131962) which allowed him to publish his predictions in three publications of Spaceway Magazine (February 1955, April 1955, and June 1955), as well as run a weekly syndicated newspaper article starting on September 6, 1951. He later published three books of predictions; ''From Now to the Year 2000'', ''Your  Next Ten Years'', and ''Forbidden Predictions''.  He also recorded a long playing record, ''Your Incredible Future'' (which  was later released on CD), featuring 84 minutes of his predictions in his own voice. Criswell appeared in the movies of writer and director [[Ed Wood]]. After Criswell's death, his longtime friend [[Paul Marco]] released Criswell's song \"Someone Walked Over My Grave\" on a 7\" record which was recorded by Criswell as a memorial song that he wanted released posthumously.\n\n===Filmography, recording and television appearances===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|- \"\n!

In a chain reaction, [[positive feedback]] leads to a self-amplifying [[chain of events]].\n\nChain reactions are one way that systems which are not in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] can release energy or increase entropy in order to reach a state of higher entropy. For example, a system may not be able to reach a lower energy state by releasing energy into the environment, because it is hindered or prevented in some way from taking the path that will result in the energy release. If a reaction results in a small energy release making way for more energy releases in an expanding chain, then the system will typically collapse explosively until much or all of the stored energy has been released. \n\nA macroscopic metaphor for chain reactions is thus a snowball causing a larger snowball until finally an avalanche results (\"[[snowball effect]]\"). This is a result of stored gravitational potential energy seeking a path of release over friction. Chemically, the equivalent to a snow avalanche is a spark causing a forest fire. In nuclear physics, a single stray neutron can result in a [[prompt critical]] event, which may finally be energetic enough for a nuclear reactor meltdown or (in a bomb) a nuclear explosion.\n\nNumerous chain reactions can be represented by a [[mathematical model]] based on [[Markov chain]]s.\n\n==Chemical chain reactions==\n=== History ===\nIn 1913, the German chemist [[Max Bodenstein]] first put forth the idea of [[chemical]] chain reactions. If two molecules react, not only molecules of the final reaction products are formed, but also some unstable molecules which can further react with the parent molecules with a far larger probability than the initial reactants (In the new reaction, further unstable molecules are formed besides the stable products, and so on ..).\n\nIn 1918, [[Walther Nernst]] proposed that the [[photochemistry|photochemical]] reaction between [[hydrogen]] and [[chlorine]] is a chain reaction in order to explain what's known as the ''[[quantum yield]]'' phenomena. This means that one [[photon]] of light is responsible for the formation of as many as 10<sup>6</sup> molecules of the product [[HCl]]. Nernst suggested that the photon dissociates a Cl<sub>2</sub> molecule into two Cl atoms which each initiate a long chain of reaction steps forming HCl.<ref name=Laidler288>Laidler K.J., ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper & Row 1987) p.288-290  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1923, Danish and Dutch scientists [[Christian Christiansen]] and [[Hendrik Anthony Kramers]], in an analysis of the formation of polymers, pointed out that such a chain reaction need not start with a molecule excited by light, but could also start with two molecules colliding violently due to thermal energy as previously proposed for initiation of chemical reactions by [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van' t Hoff]]. <ref name=Nobel1956/>\n\nChristiansen and Kramers also noted that if, in one link of the reaction chain, two or more unstable [[molecules]] are produced, the reaction chain would branch and grow. The result is in fact an exponential growth, thus giving rise to explosive increases in reaction rates, and indeed to chemical explosions themselves. This was the first proposal for the mechanism of chemical explosions.\n\nA quantitative chain chemical reaction theory was created later on by Soviet physicist [[Nikolay Semyonov]] in 1934. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?%26id%3D29264%26lang%3Den |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116032126/http://www.marka-art.ru/catalogs/StampSeries.jsp?&id=29264&lang=en |archivedate=2009-01-16 |df= }}</ref> Semyonov shared the Nobel Prize in 1956 with Sir [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]], who independently developed many of the same quantitative concepts. <ref name=Nobel1956>http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1956/press.html History of the chemical chain reaction from 1913 to the Nobel work recognized in 1956</ref>\n\n===Typical steps===\nThe main types of steps in chain reaction are of the following types.<ref name=Laidler288/>\n* [[Chain initiation|Initiation]] (formation of [[Active center (polymer science)|active particles]] or chain carriers, often [[free radical]]s, in either a thermal or a photochemical step)\n* [[Chain propagation|Propagation]] (may comprise several elementary steps in a cycle, where the active particle through reaction forms another active particle which continues the reaction chain by entering the next elementary step). In effect the active particle serves as a catalyst for the overall reaction of the propagation cycle. Particular cases are:\n:: * chain branching (a propagation step which forms more new active particles than enter the step);\n:: * [[chain transfer]] (a propagation step in which the active particle is a growing [[polymer]] chain which reacts to form an inactive polymer whose growth is terminated and an active small particle (such as a radical), which may then react to form a new polymer chain).\n* [[Chain termination|Termination]] (elementary step in which the active particle loses its activity; e. g. by [[Recombination (chemistry)|recombination]] of two free radicals).\n\nThe ''chain length'' is defined as the average number of times the propagation cycle is repeated, and equals the overall reaction rate divided by the initiation rate.<ref name=Laidler288/>\n\nSome chain reactions have complex [[rate equation]]s with [[Order of reaction#Fractional order|fractional order]] or [[Order of reaction#Mixed order|mixed order]] kinetics.\n\n=== Detailed example: the hydrogen-bromine reaction ===\nThe reaction H<sub>2</sub> + Br<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 HBr proceeds by the following mechanism:<ref name=Laidler291>[[Keith J.

The propagation is a sequence of two steps whose net effect is to replace an H atom by another H atom plus two OH radicals. This leads to an explosion under certain conditions of temperature and pressure.<ref>Laidler K.J., ''Chemical Kinetics'' (3rd ed., Harper & Row 1987) p.323-8  {{ISBN|0-06-043862-2}}</ref>\n**H + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 OH + O\n**O + H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 OH + H\n*In [[chain-growth polymerization]], the propagation step corresponds to the elongation of the growing [[polymer]] chain. Chain transfer corresponds to transfer of the activity from this growing chain, whose growth is terminated, to another molecule which may be a second growing polymer chain. For polymerization, the [[kinetic chain length]] defined above may differ from the [[degree of polymerization]] of the product macromolecule.\n*[[Polymerase chain reaction]], a technique used in [[molecular biology]] to amplify (make many copies of) a piece of [[DNA]] by ''[[in vitro]]'' [[enzyme|enzymatic]] [[DNA replication|replication]] using a [[DNA polymerase]].\n\n==Nuclear chain reactions==\n{{main|Nuclear chain reaction}}\nA ''nuclear'' chain reaction was proposed by [[Leo Szilard]] in 1933, shortly after the neutron was discovered, yet more than five years before [[nuclear fission]] was first discovered. Szil\u00e1rd knew of ''chemical'' chain reactions, and he had been reading about an energy-producing [[nuclear reaction]] involving high-energy protons bombarding lithium, demonstrated by [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]], in 1932. Now, Szil\u00e1rd proposed to use neutrons theoretically produced from certain nuclear reactions in lighter isotopes, to induce further reactions in light isotopes that produced more neutrons. This would in theory produce a chain reaction at the level of the nucleus. He did not envision fission as one of these neutron-producing reactions, since this reaction was not known at the time. Experiments he proposed using [[beryllium]] and [[indium]] failed.\n\nLater, after fission was discovered in 1938, Szil\u00e1rd immediately realized the possibility of using neutron-induced fission as the particular nuclear reaction necessary to create a chain-reaction, so long as fission also produced neutrons. In 1939, with Enrico Fermi, Szil\u00e1rd proved this neutron-multiplying reaction in uranium. In this reaction, a [[neutron]] plus a fissionable [[atom]] causes a fission resulting in a larger number of neutrons than the single one that was consumed in the initial reaction. Thus was born the practical [[nuclear chain reaction]] by the mechanism of neutron-induced nuclear fission.\n\nSpecifically, if one or more of the produced neutrons themselves interact with other fissionable nuclei, and these also undergo fission, then there is a possibility that the macroscopic overall fission reaction will not stop, but continue throughout the reaction material. This is then a self-propagating and thus self-sustaining chain reaction. This is the principle for [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[atomic bomb]]s.\n\nDemonstration of a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction was accomplished by [[Enrico Fermi]] and others, in the successful operation of [[Chicago Pile-1]], the first artificial nuclear reactor, in late 1942.\n\n==Electron avalanche in gases==\nAn [[electron avalanche]] happens between two unconnected electrodes in a gas when an electric field exceeds a certain threshold. Random thermal collisions of gas atoms may result in a few free electrons and positively charged gas ions, in a process called [[impact ionization]]. Acceleration of these free electrons in a strong [[electric field]] causes them to gain energy, and when they impact other atoms, the energy causes release of new free electrons and ions (ionization), which fuels the same process. If this process happens faster than it is naturally quenched by ions recombining, the new ions multiply in successive cycles until the gas breaks down into a plasma and current flows freely in a discharge.\n\nElectron avalanches are essential to the [[dielectric breakdown]] process within gases. The process can culminate in [[corona discharge]]s, [[Streamer discharge|streamer]]s, [[leader (spark)|leader]]s, or in a [[electric spark|spark]] or continuous [[electric arc]] that completely bridges the gap. The process may extend huge sparks \u2014 streamers in [[lightning]] discharges propagate by formation of electron avalanches created in the high potential gradient ahead of the streamers' advancing tips. Once begun, avalanches are often intensified by the creation of [[photoelectron]]s as a result of ultraviolet radiation emitted by the excited medium's atoms in the aft-tip region. The extremely high temperature of the resulting plasma cracks the surrounding gas molecules and the free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds.<ref>{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | author= | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/| accessdate = March 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe process can also be used to detect radiation that initiates the process, as the passage of a single particles can amplified to large discharges. This is the mechanism of a [[Geiger counter]] and also the visualization possible with a [[spark chamber]] and other [[wire chamber]]s.\n\n==Avalanche breakdown in semiconductors==\nAn [[avalanche breakdown]] process can happen in semiconductors, which in some ways conduct electricity analogously to a mildly ionized gas. Semiconductors rely on free electrons knocked out of the crystal by thermal vibration for conduction. Thus, unlike metals, semiconductors become better conductors the higher the temperature. This sets up conditions for the same type of positive feedback\u2014heat from current flow causes temperature to rise, which increases charge carriers, lowering resistance, and causing more current to flow. This can continue to the point of complete breakdown of normal resistance at a semiconductor junction, and failure of the device (this may be temporary or permanent depending on whether there is physical damage to the crystal). Certain devices, such as [[avalanche diode]]s, deliberately make use of the effect.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cascading failure]]\n* [[Multiple-vehicle collision]]\n* [[Rube Goldberg machine]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{commons category|Chain reactions}}\n*[http://goldbook.iupac.org/C00960.html IUPAC Gold Book - Chain reaction]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chain Reaction}}\n[[Category:Chemical kinetics]]\n[[Category:Metaphors referring to objects]]\n[[Category:Causality]]", "sha1": "4a44krh6oxmkhbkgy3laisvp1zu4kl9"}}, {"title": "Caddie", "ns": "0", "id": "7837", "revision": {"id": "864770770", "parentid": "859539421", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T10:37:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "WereSpielChequers", "id": "4071608"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[WP:AWB/T|Typo fixing]], replaced: a  a  \u2192  a, [[WP:AWB/T|typo(s) fixed]]: r\u2019s \u2192 r's", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses|Caddy (disambiguation)}}\n{{unreferenced|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn [[golf]], a '''caddie''' (or '''caddy''') is the person who carries a player's bag and [[Golf club|clubs]], and gives insightful advice and moral support. A good caddie is aware of the challenges and obstacles of the [[golf course]] being played, along with the best strategy in playing it. This includes knowing overall yardage, pin placements and club selection. A caddie is not usually an employee of a private club or resort. They are classified as an \"independent contractor\", meaning that he or she is basically self-employed and does not receive any benefits or perks from his association with the club. Some clubs and resorts do have caddie programs, although benefits are rarely offered.  Particularly in Europe, the vast majority of clubs do not offer caddies, and amateur players will commonly carry or pull their own bags.\n\n[[Image:the caddy 233.jpg|300px|thumb|<center>A caddie plies his trade, 2007</center>]]\n[[File:Imaginative_Marguerite_Martyn_drawing_of_Forest_Park_Golf_Course,_St._Louis,_in_1914.jpg|thumb|right|Imaginative drawing by journalist [[Marguerite Martyn]] of a couple at the Forest Park Golf Course, St. Louis, Missouri, in 1914, while a caddie leans against a tree]]\n[[File:Golf caddy.JPG|thumb|A golf caddie depicted in a late-18th-century painting. Artist unknown.]]\n\n== Types of caddying ==\n'''Traditional caddying''' involves both the golfer and the caddie walking the course.  The caddie is in charge of carrying the player's bag, and walks ahead of the golfer to locate his ball and calculate the yardage to the pin and/or hazards.  This is the most common method used in golf clubs and is the only method allowed in the [[Professional Golfers' Association|PGA (Professional Golf Association)]] and [[LPGA|LPGA (Ladies Professional Golf Association)]]. The three \"ups\" of caddying are: show up, shut up, and keep up.\n\n'''Fore-Caddying''' entails the caddie walking while the players ride in carts. The fore-caddie will give a hole description and then walk ahead to spot the players' tee shots. The caddie then gets the player's yardage (either with a GPS watch, laser, course knowledge, or sprinkler heads) while the players drive their carts from the tee to their shots. The caddie walks ahead again to spot the golfer's next shots. This process is continued until the players reach the green. Once on the [[green (golf)|green]] the caddie will read greens (if asked per proper [[golf etiquette]]), clean [[golf balls]] (if asked), fix ball marks, and attend the flag. The caddie is also responsible for raking [[bunker (golf)|traps]] on the course. Caddies will help with club selection, reading greens, weather variables, and marking balls on the green but should do so only if asked by the player. More than anything else, the caddie is there to make the player's round enjoyable by taking care of menial tasks, speeding up play, and providing mental support if asked.\n\n==Caddie ranks==\nMany clubs use a ranking system. Caddies will start as a trainee, and be promoted through the ranks of Intermediate, Captain, Honor, and finally Championship. Many courses start their caddies off at the B level, and after a year move them to A, and on their fourth year (if they have earned it), they will receive the title of Honor caddie. The intermediate and captain ranks can usually be obtained within the first year of caddying, and the honor rank is usually obtained in the second or third year of caddying. Championship takes at least 6 years and often as many as 10 years to obtain. An alternative ranking system often used in the American Mid-West proceeds as B level, A level, AA level, Honor level, and [[Evans Scholars Foundation|Evans Scholar]]. Caddies often obtain a promotion in rank once a year, while often Honor takes two years to achieve and Evans Scholars are only produced by winning the venerable Evans Scholarship for university. However, in many American clubs, caddies are divided simply between \"B\" caddies (usually younger, less experienced caddies who often carry only one bag), and \"A\" caddies (usually older, more experienced caddies who almost always carry two bags).\n\n== Weekly schedule ==\nCaddies are most frequently employed at clubs on weekends, when the majority of country club golf takes place.  Some (but usually not as many) opportunities to caddie exist during the week, as well.  Additionally, caddies are often allowed to play the course at which they caddie for free, usually on a Monday (the day that most private clubs choose to close their course for maintenance).  On pro golf tours, professional caddies accompany their player to all events, which usually take place from Thursday through Sunday.  Additionally, the player may hire their caddie to carry their bag for them during training sessions and practice rounds.\n\n== Pay scale ==\nAt most clubs, caddies are paid at the end of the round by cash, or receive a payment ticket for which they can redeem their wages in the clubhouse.  Generally, the player will tip the caddie based on their performance during the round, with extra money given for exemplary work.  Most American club caddies earn between $80 and $120 per bag, though newer caddies will often earn less than more experienced caddies.  Caddies working during a tournament, high-stakes match, or 4-Day member-guest will often earn significantly more, upwards of $150 per round, per bag, at times. It is common for experienced caddies to carry two bags at a time. It is considered acceptable to ask a professional at the course what the average pay for a caddie is, as courses differ.\n\nIn a [[professional golf tour]] setting, a player often pays their caddie a percentage of their winnings, which can be as high as 10%.  A common pay scale is 5% for making the cut, 7% for a top 10, and 10% for a win. The caddie also usually receives a salary, as the player is not guaranteed to win money at every tournament.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Caddie Hall of Fame inductees]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|caddies}}\n{{wiktionary|caddie|caddy}}\n* [http://www.eurocaddies.com European Tour Caddies Association]\n* [https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/golf/caddies-making-a-comeback/ \"Caddies making a comeback\"], ''[[The Seattle Times]]''\n* [http://www.mcsweeneys.net/columns/notes-from-the-caddieshack \"Notes from the Caddieshack\"] - a McSweeney's Internet Tendency column about being a caddie in the Chicago suburbs\n\n{{Golf}}\n\n[[Category:Caddies| ]]\n[[Category:Golf people]]\n\n[[sv:Lista \u00f6ver golftermer#Caddie]]", "sha1": "n74kgikombyyu72duq8vzvnnkwmi6y5"}}, {"title": "Compound turbine", "ns": "0", "id": "7838", "revision": {"id": "811129209", "parentid": "811129128", "timestamp": "2017-11-19T18:25:27Z", "contributor": {"username": "Nurab216", "id": "31957645"}, "comment": "/* Tandem compound or cross compound */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "A '''compound turbine''' is a [[steam turbine]] in which there are two casings, a high-[[pressure]] casing and a low-pressure casing, operating in concert to extract work from a single source of steam.

The Sun's corona extends millions of kilometres into outer space and is most easily seen during a total [[solar eclipse]], but it is also observable with a [[coronagraph]].

The K-corona (K&nbsp;for ''kontinuierlich'', \"continuous\" in German) is created by sunlight [[Thomson scattering|scattering]] off free [[electron]]s; [[Doppler broadening]] of the reflected photospheric [[absorption line]]s spreads them so greatly as to completely obscure them, giving the spectral appearance of a continuum with no absorption lines. The F-corona (F&nbsp;for [[Joseph von Fraunhofer|Fraunhofer]]) is created by sunlight bouncing off dust particles, and is observable because its light contains the Fraunhofer absorption lines that are seen in raw sunlight; the F-corona extends to very high [[elongation (astronomy)|elongation]] angles from the Sun, where it is called the [[zodiacal light]]. The E-corona (E for emission) is due to spectral emission lines produced by ions that are present in the coronal plasma; it may be observed in broad or [[forbidden line|forbidden]] or hot [[spectral line|spectral emission lines]] and is the main source of information about the corona's composition.<ref name=\"Corfield\">{{cite book\n|last=Corfield\n|first=Richard\n|year=2007\n|title=Lives of the Planets\n|publisher=Basic Books\n|isbn=978-0-465-01403-3}}\n</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Solar eclipse 1806Jun16-Corona-Ferrer.png|thumb|Corona sketched by [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Ferrer]] during the [[solar eclipse of June 16, 1806]] in [[Kinderhook (town), New York|Kinderhook, New York]].]]\nIn 1724, French-Italian astronomer [[Giacomo F. Maraldi]] recognized that the aura visible during a [[solar eclipse]] belongs to the [[Sun]] not to the [[Moon]]. In 1809, Spanish astronomer [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn de Ferrer]] coined the term 'corona'<ref>{{Cite journal|last=de Ferrer|first=Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn|date=1809|title=Observations of the eclipse of the sun June 16th 1806 made at Kinderhook in the State of New York|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DbkAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA264#v=onepage&q=corona&f=false|journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.|volume=6|pages=264|via=}}</ref>. Based in his own observations of the 1806 solar eclipse at Kinderhook (New York), de Ferrer also proposed that the corona was part of the Sun and not of the Moon. English astronomer [[Norman Lockyer]] identified the first element unknown on Earth in the Sun's chromosphere, which was called [[helium]]. French astronomer [[Pierre Janssen|Jules Jenssen]] noted that the size and shape of the corona changes with the [[Solar cycle|sunspot cycle]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Totality2/TotalityApH.html|title=Chronology of Discoveries about the Sun|last=Espenak|first=Fred|date=|website=Mr. Eclipse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref>. In 1930, [[Bernard Lyot]] invented the [[Coronagraph|coronograph]], which allows to see the corona without a total eclipse. In 1952, American astronomer [[Eugene Parker]] proposed that the solar corona might be heated by myriad tiny 'nanoflares', miniature brightenings resembling [[solar flares]] that would occur all over the surface of the Sun.\n\n=== Historical theories ===\nThe high temperature of the Sun's corona gives it unusual [[spectroscopy|spectral]] features, which led some in the 19th century to suggest that it contained a previously unknown element, \"[[coronium]]\". Instead, these spectral features have since been explained by [[highly charged ion|highly ionized]] [[iron]] (Fe-XIV, or Fe<sup>13+</sup>).  [[Bengt Edl\u00e9n]], following the work of Grotrian (1939), first identified the coronal spectral lines in 1940 (observed since 1869) as transitions from low-lying [[metastable]] levels of the ground configuration of highly ionised metals (the green Fe-XIV line from Fe<sup>13+</sup> at 5303&nbsp;[[\u00c5ngstr\u00f6m|\u00c5]], but also the red Fe-X line from Fe<sup>9+</sup> at 6374&nbsp;\u00c5).<ref name=\"Aschwanden\" />\n\n== Physical features ==\n[[File:Twistedflux.png|thumb|A drawing demonstrating the configuration of solar magnetic flux during the solar cycle]]\n\nThe sun's corona is much hotter (by a factor from 150 to 450) than the visible surface of the Sun: the [[photosphere]]'s average [[temperature]] is 5800 [[kelvin]]s compared to the corona's one to three million kelvins. The corona is 10<sup>\u221212</sup> times as dense as the photosphere, and so produces about one-millionth as much visible light. The corona is separated from the photosphere by the relatively shallow [[chromosphere]]. The exact mechanism by which the corona is heated is still the subject of some debate, but likely possibilities include induction by the Sun's [[magnetic field]] and [[Magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic waves]] from below. The outer edges of the Sun's corona are constantly being transported away due to open magnetic flux and hence generating the [[solar wind]].\n\nThe corona is not always evenly distributed across the surface of the sun. During periods of quiet, the corona is more or less confined to the [[equator]]ial regions, with [[coronal hole]]s covering the [[Geographical pole|polar]] regions. However, during the Sun's active periods, the corona is evenly distributed over the equatorial and polar regions, though it is most prominent in areas with [[sunspot]] activity. The [[solar cycle]] spans approximately 11 years, from [[solar minimum]] to the following minimum. Since the solar magnetic field is continually wound up due to the faster rotation of mass at the sun's equator ([[differential rotation]]), sunspot activity will be more pronounced at [[solar maximum]] where the [[magnetic field]] is more twisted. Associated with sunspots are [[coronal loop]]s, loops of [[magnetic flux]], upwelling from the solar interior. The magnetic flux pushes the hotter [[photosphere]] aside, exposing the cooler plasma below, thus creating the relatively dark sun spots.\n\nSince the corona has been photographed at high resolution in the X-ray range of the spectrum by the satellite [[Skylab]] in 1973, and then later by [[Yohkoh]] and the other following space instruments, it has been seen that the structure of the corona is quite varied and complex: different zones have been immediately classified on the coronal disc.<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF00152731|last1 = Vaiana|first1 = G.

Their temperature is about 5000\u20138000&nbsp;K, and so they are usually considered as chromospheric features.\n\nIn 2013, images from the [[High Resolution Coronal Imager]] revealed never-before-seen \"magnetic braids\" of plasma within the outer layers of these active regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/19400-sun-corona-secrets-suborbital-telescope.html|title=How NASA Revealed Sun's Hottest Secret in 5-Minute Spaceflight|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124115740/http://www.space.com/19400-sun-corona-secrets-suborbital-telescope.html|archivedate=2013-01-24|df=}}</ref>\n\n====Coronal loops====\n{{main article|Coronal loop}}\n[[File:Traceimage.jpg|left|thumb|TRACE 171\u00c5 coronal loops]]\n[[Coronal loop]]s are the basic structures of the magnetic solar corona.

Often, the solar plasma will fill these loops from one point and drain to another, called foot points ([[siphon]] flow due to a pressure difference,<ref>{{cite journal|doi = 10.1023/A:1005182503751|last1 = Betta |first1 = Rita|last2 = Orlando|first2 = Salvatore|last3 = Peres|first3 = Giovanni|last4 = Serio|first4 = Salvatore | title = On the Stability of Siphon Flows in Coronal Loops\n  | journal = Space Science Reviews | volume = 87 | pages = 133\u2013136| year = 1999|bibcode = 1999SSRv...87..133B }}</ref> or asymmetric flow due to some other driver).\n\nWhen the plasma rises from the foot points towards the loop top, as always occurs during the initial phase of a compact flare, it is defined as chromospheric [[evaporation]]. When the plasma rapidly cools and falls toward the photosphere, it is called chromospheric [[condensation]]. There may also be [[symmetric]] flow from both loop foot points, causing a build-up of mass in the loop structure. The plasma may cool rapidly in this region (for a thermal instability), its dark [[Solar prominence|filaments]] obvious against the solar disk or [[solar prominence|prominences]] off the [[limb darkening|Sun's limb]].\n\nCoronal loops may have lifetimes in the order of seconds (in the case of flare events), minutes, hours or days. Where there is a balance in loop energy sources and sinks, coronal loops can last for long periods of time and are known as ''[[steady state]]'' or ''[[wikt:quiescent|quiescent]]'' coronal loops.  ([[:File:Energyfig.png|example]]).\n\nCoronal loops are very important to our understanding of the current ''coronal heating problem''. Coronal loops are highly radiating sources of plasma and are therefore easy to observe by instruments such as ''[[TRACE]]''. An explanation of the coronal heating problem remains as these structures are being observed remotely, where many ambiguities are present (i.e. radiation contributions along the [[Line-of-sight propagation|LOS]]). ''[[In-situ]]'' measurements are required before a definitive answer can be had, but due to the high plasma temperatures in the corona, ''in-situ'' measurements are, at present, impossible. The next mission of the NASA, the [[Parker Solar Probe]] will approach the Sun very closely allowing more direct observations.\n\n[[File:Coronal Hole Magnetic Field Lines.svg|thumb|Coronal arches connecting regions of opposite magnetic polarity (A) and the unipolar magnetic field in the coronal hole (B)]]\n\n====Large-scale structures====\n'''Large-scale structures''' are very long arcs which can cover over a quarter of the solar disk but contain plasma less dense than in the coronal loops of the active regions.\n\nThey were first detected in the June 8, 1968 flare observation during a rocket flight.<ref name = Giacconi>{{cite book |last = Giacconi| first = Riccardo| title = G.S.

They were first observed in the two 1970 rocket flights which also detected ''coronal holes''.<ref name=Giacconi />\n\nFilament cavities are cooler clouds of gases (plasma) suspended above the Sun's surface by magnetic forces. The regions of intense magnetic field look dark in images because they are empty of hot plasma. In fact, the sum of the [[magnetic pressure]] and plasma pressure must be constant everywhere on the heliosphere in order to have an equilibrium configuration: where the magnetic field is higher, the plasma must be cooler or less dense. The plasma pressure <math>p</math> can be calculated by the [[state equation]] of a perfect gas  <math> p = n K_B T</math>, where <math>n</math> is the [[particle number density]], <math>K_B</math> the [[Boltzmann constant]] and <math>T</math> the plasma temperature. It is evident from the equation that the plasma pressure lowers when the plasma temperature decreases with respect to the surrounding regions or when the zone of intense magnetic field empties. The same physical effect renders [[sunspot]]s apparently dark in the [[photosphere]].\n\n====Bright points====\n'''Bright points''' are small active regions found on the solar disk. X-ray bright points were first detected on April 8, 1969 during a rocket flight.<ref name=Giacconi />\n\nThe fraction of the solar surface covered by bright points varies with the [[solar cycle]]. They are associated with small bipolar regions of the magnetic field. Their average temperature ranges from 1.1x10<sup>6</sup> K to 3.4x10<sup>6</sup> K.

The result of the Sun's differential rotation is that the active regions always arise in two bands parallel to the equator and their extension increases during the periods of maximum of the [[solar cycle]], while they almost disappear during each minimum. Therefore, the quiet Sun always coincides with the equatorial zone and its surface is less active during the maximum of the solar cycle. Approaching the minimum of the solar cycle (also named butterfly cycle), the extension of the quiet Sun increases until it covers the whole disk surface excluding some bright points on the hemisphere and the poles, where there are coronal holes.\n\n==Variability of the corona==\nA portrait as diversified as the one already pointed out for the coronal features is emphasized by the analysis of the dynamics of the main structures of the corona,  which evolve in times very different among them. Studying the coronal variability in its complexity is not easy because the times of evolution of the different structures can vary considerably: from seconds to several months.

However these stars do not have coronae, but the outer stellar envelopes emit this radiation during shocks due to thermal instabilities in rapidly moving gas blobs.\nAlso A-stars do not have convection zones but they do not emit at the UV and X-ray wavelengths. Thus they appear to have neither chromospheres nor coronae.\n\n==Physics of the corona==\n[[File:171879main LimbFlareJan12 lg.jpg|thumb|left|This image, taken by [[Hinode]] on 12 January 2007, reveals the filamentary nature of the corona.]]\n\nThe matter in the external part of the solar atmosphere is in the state of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], at very high temperature (a few million kelvins) and at very low density (of the order of 10<sup>15</sup> particles/m<sup>3</sup>).\nAccording to the definition of plasma, it is a quasi-neutral ensemble of particles which exhibits a collective behaviour.\n\nThe composition is similar to that in the Sun's interior, mainly hydrogen, but with much greater ionization than that found in the photosphere. Heavier metals, such as iron, are partially ionized and have lost most of the external electrons. The ionization state of a chemical element depends strictly on the temperature and is regulated by the [[Saha equation]] in the lowest atmosphere, but by collisional equilibrium in the optically-thin corona. Historically, the presence of the spectral lines emitted from highly ionized states of iron allowed determination of the high temperature of the coronal plasma, revealing that the corona is much hotter than the internal layers of the chromosphere.\n\nThe corona behaves like a gas which is very hot but very light at the same time: the pressure in the corona is usually only 0.1 to 0.6 Pa in active regions, while on the Earth the atmospheric pressure is about 100 kPa, approximately a million times higher than on the solar surface. However it is not properly a gas, because it is made of charged particles, basically protons and electrons, moving at different velocities. Supposing that they have the same kinetic energy on average\n(for the [[equipartition theorem]]), electrons have a mass roughly 1800 times smaller than protons, therefore they acquire more velocity. Metal ions are always slower. This fact has relevant physical consequences either on radiative processes (that are very different from the photospheric radiative processes), or on thermal conduction.\nFurthermore, the presence of electric charges induces the generation of electric currents and high magnetic fields.\nMagnetohydrodynamic waves (MHD waves) can also propagate in this plasma,<ref name=\"Jeffrey\">{{cite book\n|last = Jeffrey\n|first = Alan\n|year =1969\n|title = Magneto-hydrodynamics\n|publisher = UNIVERSITY MATHEMATICAL TEXTS\n}}</ref> even if it is not still clear how they can be transmitted or generated in the corona.\n\n===Radiation===\n{{Main article|Coronal radiative losses}}\n\nThe corona emits radiation mainly in the X-rays, observable only from space.\n\nThe plasma is transparent to its own radiation and to that one coming from below, therefore we say that it is  '''optically-thin'''. The gas, in fact, is very rarefied and the photon mean free-path overcomes by far all the other length-scales, including the typical sizes of the coronal features.\n\nDifferent processes of radiation take place in the emission, due to binary collisions between plasma particles, while the interactions with the photons, coming from below; are very rare.\nBecause the emission is due to collisions between ions and electrons, the energy emitted from a unit volume in the time unit is proportional to the squared number of particles in a unit volume, or more exactly, to the product of the electron density and proton density.<ref>{{cite journal| doi = 10.1007/BF00873539| last = Mewe | first = R.| title = X-ray spectroscopy of stellar coronae| journal = The Astronomy and Astrophysics Review | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | page = 127 | year = 1991 | bibcode=1991A&ARv...3..127M}}</ref>\n\n===Thermal conduction===\n[[File:STEREO-A first images.jpg|thumb|A mosaic of the extreme ultraviolet images taken from [[STEREO]] on December 4, 2006.

This force bends the path of the particle. In general, since particles also have a velocity component along the magnetic field line, the [[Lorentz force]] constrains them to bend and move along spirals around the field lines at the [[cyclotron]] frequency.\n\nIf collisions between the particles are very frequent, they are scattered in every direction. This happens in the photosphere, where the plasma carries the magnetic field in its motion. In the corona, on the contrary, the mean free-path of the electrons is of the order of kilometres and even more, so each electron can do a helicoidal motion long before being scattered after a collision. Therefore, the heat transfer is enhanced along the magnetic field lines and inhibited in the perpendicular direction.\n\nIn the direction longitudinal to the magnetic field, the [[thermal conductivity]] of the corona is<ref name=\"Spitzer\" />\n\n<math>\nk = 20 \\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{3/2}\\frac{\\left(k_B T \\right)^{5/2}k_B}{m_e^{1/2} e^4 \\ln \\Lambda} \\approx 1.8~10^{-10}~\\frac{T^{5/2}}{\\ln \\Lambda}~ W m^{-1}K^{-1}\n</math>\n\nwhere <math>k_B</math> is the [[Boltzmann constant]],\n<math>T</math> is the temperature in kelvins,\n<math>m_e</math> the electron mass,\n<math>e</math> the electric charge of the electron,\n\n<math> \\ln \\Lambda = \\ln \\left(12\\pi n \\lambda_D^3 \\right) </math>\n\nthe Coulomb logarithm, and\n\n<math>\\lambda_D = \\sqrt{\\frac{k_B T }{4 \\pi n e^2 }}</math>\n\nthe [[Debye length]] of the plasma with particle density  <math>n</math>.\nThe Coulomb logarithm <math> \\ln \\Lambda </math> is roughly 20 in the corona, with a mean temperature of 1 MK and a density of 10<sup>15</sup> particles/m<sup>3</sup>, and about 10 in the chromosphere, where the temperature is approximately 10kK and the particle density is of the order of 10<sup>18</sup> particles/m<sup>3</sup>, and in practice it can be assumed constant.\n\nThence, if we indicate with <math>q</math> the heat for a volume unit, expressed in J m<sup>\u22123</sup>, the Fourier equation of heat transfer, to be computed only along the direction <math>x</math> of the field line, becomes\n\n<math> \\frac{\\partial q}{\\partial t}= 0.9~10^{-11}~ \\frac{\\partial^2  T^{7/2}}{\\partial x ^2 }</math>.\n\nNumerical calculations have shown that the thermal conductivity of the corona is comparable to that of copper.\n\n===Coronal seismology===\n{{main article|Coronal seismology}}\n'''Coronal seismology''' is a new way of studying the [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] of the solar corona with the use of [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] (MHD) waves. Magnetohydrodynamics studies the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of [[electrical conduction|electrically conducting]] [[fluid]]s\u2014in this case the fluid is the coronal plasma. Philosophically, coronal seismology is similar to the Earth's [[seismology]], the Sun's [[helioseismology]], and MHD spectroscopy of laboratory plasma devices. In all these approaches, waves of various kinds are used to probe a medium. The potential of coronal seismology in the estimation of the coronal magnetic field, density [[scale height]], [[fine structure]] and heating has been demonstrated by different research groups.\n\n==Coronal heating problem==\n{{unsolved|physics|Why is the Sun's corona so much hotter than the Sun's surface?}}\n[[File:Van Gogh Sun.ogv|thumb|A new visualisation technique can provide clues to the coronal heating problem.]]\n\nThe coronal heating problem in [[solar physics]] relates to the question of why the temperature of the Sun's corona is millions of kelvins higher than that of the surface. The high temperatures require energy to be carried from the solar interior to the corona by non-thermal processes, because the [[second law of thermodynamics]] prevents heat from flowing directly from the solar photosphere (surface), which is at about 5800 K, to the much hotter corona at about 1 to 3 [[SI prefix|MK]] (parts of the corona can even reach 10 MK).\n\nBetween the photosphere and the corona, is the thin region through which the temperature increases known as the [[solar transition region|transition region]]. It ranges from only tens to hundreds of kilometers thick. Energy cannot be transferred from the cooler photosphere to the corona by conventional heat transfer as this would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. An analogy of this would be a light bulb raising the temperature of the air surrounding it to something greater than its glass surface.  Hence, some other manner of energy transfer must be involved in the heating of the corona.\n\nThe amount of power required to heat the solar corona can easily be calculated as the difference between [[coronal radiative losses]] and heating by thermal conduction toward the [[chromosphere]] through the transition region. It is about 1 kilowatt for every square meter of surface area on the Sun's chromosphere, or 1/40000 of the amount of light energy that escapes the Sun.\n\nMany coronal heating theories have been proposed,<ref>{{cite book |last = Ulmshneider |first= Peter |title = Heating of Chromospheres and Coronae in ''Space Solar Physics'', Proceedings, Orsay, France |editor = J.C.

It is hypothesized that the reconnection and unravelling of braids can act as primary sources of heating of the active solar corona to temperatures of up to 4 million kelvins. The main heat source in the quiescent corona (about 1.5 million kelvins) is assumed to originate from [[Magnetohydrodynamics|MHD waves]].<ref name=Cirtain2013>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cirtain | first1 = J.

The Sun is made of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to [[sound waves]] in air. The most important types of wave are [[magneto-acoustic wave]]s and [[Alfv\u00e9n wave]]s.<ref>{{cite journal\n  | last = Alfv\u00e9n\n  | first = Hannes\n  | title = Magneto hydrodynamic waves, and the heating of the solar corona\n  | journal = MNRAS\n  | volume = 107\n  | issue = 2\n  | pages = 211\u2013219\n  | year = 1947\n  |bibcode = 1947MNRAS.107..211A\n  | doi=10.1093/mnras/107.2.211}}</ref> Magneto-acoustic waves are sound waves that have been modified by the presence of a magnetic field, and Alfv\u00e9n waves are similar to [[ultra low frequency]] [[radio waves]] that have been modified by interaction with [[matter]] in the plasma. Both types of waves can be launched by the turbulence of [[Granule (solar physics)|granulation]] and [[super granulation]] at the solar photosphere, and both types of waves can carry energy for some distance through the solar atmosphere before turning into [[shock waves]] that dissipate their energy as heat.\n\nOne problem with wave heating is delivery of the heat to the appropriate place. Magneto-acoustic waves cannot carry sufficient energy upward through the chromosphere to the corona, both because of the low pressure present in the chromosphere and because they tend to be [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] back to the photosphere. Alfv\u00e9n waves can carry enough energy, but do not dissipate that energy rapidly enough once they enter the corona. Waves in plasmas are notoriously difficult to understand and describe analytically, but computer simulations, carried out by Thomas Bogdan and colleagues in 2003, seem to show that Alfv\u00e9n waves can transmute into other wave modes at the base of the corona, providing a pathway that can carry large amounts of energy from the photosphere through the chromosphere and transition region and finally into the corona where it dissipates it as heat.\n\nAnother problem with wave heating has been the complete absence, until the late 1990s, of any direct evidence of waves propagating through the solar corona. The first direct observation of waves propagating into and through the solar corona was made in 1997 with the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] space-borne solar observatory, the first platform capable of observing the Sun in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) for long periods of time with stable [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]]. Those were magneto-acoustic waves with a frequency of about 1 [[hertz|millihertz]] (mHz, corresponding to a 1,000 second wave period), that carry only about 10% of the energy required to heat the corona. Many observations exist of localized wave phenomena, such as Alfv\u00e9n waves launched by solar flares, but those events are transient and cannot explain the uniform coronal heat.\n\nIt is not yet known exactly how much wave energy is available to heat the corona. Results published in 2004 using data from the [[TRACE]] spacecraft seem to indicate that there are waves in the solar atmosphere at frequencies as high as 100 mHz (10 second period). Measurements of the temperature of different [[ions]] in the solar wind with the UVCS instrument aboard [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] give strong indirect evidence that there are waves at frequencies as high as 200&nbsp;Hz, well into the range of human hearing. These waves are very difficult to detect under normal circumstances, but evidence collected during solar eclipses by teams from [[Williams College]] suggest the presences of such waves in the 1\u201310&nbsp;Hz range.\n\nRecently, Alfv\u00e9nic motions have been found in the lower solar atmosphere <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.science20.com/news_releases/alfven_waves_our_sun_doing_magnetic_twist |title=Alfven Waves \u2013 Our Sun Is Doing The Magnetic Twist |publisher=read on Jan 6 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723053337/http://www.science20.com/news_releases/alfven_waves_our_sun_doing_magnetic_twist |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1168680 | last1 = Jess | first1 = DB | last2 = Mathioudakis | first2 = M | last3 = Erd\u00e9lyi | first3 = R | last4 = Crockett | first4 = PJ | last5 = Keenan | first5 = FP | last6 = Christian | first6 = DJ | title = Alfv\u00e9n Waves in the Lower Solar Atmosphere | journal = Science | volume = 323| issue =  5921 | pages = 1582\u20131585 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19299614|bibcode = 2009Sci...323.1582J |arxiv = 0903.3546 | hdl = 10211.3/172550 }}</ref> and also in the quiet Sun, in coronal holes and in active regions using observations with AIA on board the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=McIntosh, S.

This process is called \"reconnection\" because of the peculiar way that magnetic fields behave in plasma (or any electrically conductive fluid such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[seawater]]). In a plasma, [[magnetic field lines]] are normally tied to individual pieces of matter, so that the [[topology]] of the magnetic field remains the same: if a particular north and south [[Poles of astronomical bodies#Magnetic poles|magnetic pole]] are connected by a single field line, then even if the plasma is stirred or if the magnets are moved around, that field line will continue to connect those particular poles. The connection is maintained by electric currents that are induced in the plasma. Under certain conditions, the electric currents can collapse, allowing the magnetic field to \"reconnect\" to other magnetic poles and release heat and wave energy in the process.\n\n[[Magnetic reconnection]] is hypothesized to be the mechanism behind solar flares, the largest explosions in our solar system. Furthermore, the surface of the Sun is covered with millions of small magnetized regions 50\u20131,000&nbsp;km across. These small magnetic poles are buffeted and churned by the constant granulation. The magnetic field in the solar corona must undergo nearly constant reconnection to match the motion of this \"magnetic carpet\", so the energy released by the reconnection is a natural candidate for the coronal heat, perhaps as a series of \"microflares\" that individually provide very little energy but together account for the required energy.\n\nThe idea that [[nanoflares]] might heat the corona was proposed by [[Eugene Parker]] in the 1980s but is still controversial. In particular, [[ultraviolet]] telescopes such as [[TRACE]] and [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]]/EIT can observe individual micro-flares as small brightenings in extreme ultraviolet light,<ref>{{cite journal\n  | doi = 10.1051/0004-6361:20020151\n  | last1 = Patsourakos\n  | first1 = S.\n  | last2 = Vial\n  | first2 = J.-C.\n  | title = Intermittent behavior in the transition region and the low corona of the quiet Sun\n  | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics\n  | volume = 385\n  | issue = 3\n  | pages = 1073\u20131077\n  | year = 2002\n| bibcode=2002A&A...385.1073P\n}}</ref> but there seem to be too few of these small events to account for the energy released into the corona. The additional energy not accounted for could be made up by wave energy, or by gradual magnetic reconnection that releases energy more smoothly than micro-flares and therefore doesn't appear well in the [[TRACE]] data. Variations on the micro-flare hypothesis use other mechanisms to stress the magnetic field or to release the energy, and are a subject of active research in 2005.\n\n===Spicules (type II)===\nFor decades, researchers believed [[spicule (solar physics)|spicules]] could send heat into the corona.

It is the sequel to ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', which was released in 1995 for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]. ''Chrono Cross'' was designed primarily by scenarist and director [[Masato Kato]], who had help from other designers who also worked on ''Chrono Trigger'', including art director [[Yasuyuki Honne]] and composer [[Yasunori Mitsuda]]. [[Nobuteru Y\u016bki]] designed the [[Characters of Chrono Cross|characters of the game]].\n\nThe story of ''Chrono Cross'' focuses on a teenage boy named [[Serge (Chrono Cross)|Serge]] and a theme of [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel worlds]]. Faced with an alternate reality in which he died as a child, Serge endeavors to discover the truth of the two worlds' divergence. The flashy thief [[Kid (Chrono Cross)|Kid]] and many other characters assist him in his travels around the tropical archipelago El Nido. Struggling to uncover his past and find the mysterious Frozen Flame, Serge is chiefly challenged by [[Lynx (Chrono Cross)|Lynx]], a shadowy antagonist working to apprehend him.\n\nUpon its release in Japan in 1999 and North America in 2000, ''Chrono Cross'' received critical acclaim, earning a perfect 10.0 score from [[GameSpot]].<ref name=\"gamerankings\">{{cite web|title=Chrono Cross |url=http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages4/196917.asp |publisher=[[GameRankings]] |accessdate=2007-07-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020052718/http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages4/196917.asp |archivedate=2007-10-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"perfect-10\" /> The game shipped over {{Nowrap|1.5 million}} copies worldwide, leading to a Greatest Hits re-release and continued life in Japan as part of the [[Ultimate Hit]]s series.<ref name=\"square-sales\">{{cite web|date=2003-08-04 |title=Square Enix IR Roadshow Document |url=http://www.square-enix.com/jp/ir/e/explanatory/download/0404-200308040000-01.pdf |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |accessdate=2006-07-06 |format=PDF |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723104903/http://www.square-enix.com/jp/ir/e/explanatory/download/0404-200308040000-01.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-23 }}</ref><ref name=\"ultimatehits\">{{cite web|date=2006-04-28 |first=Chris |last=Winkler |title=Square Enix Adds 16 to Ultimate Hits Series |url=http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2006/1219.html |publisher=RPGFan |accessdate=2006-07-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017183611/http://www.rpgfan.com/news/2006/1219.html |archivedate=2015-10-17 }}</ref> ''Chrono Cross'' was later re-released for the [[PlayStation Network]] in Japan in July 2011, and in North America four months later.<ref name=\"psnnetwork\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Chrono Cross'' features standard [[role-playing video game]] gameplay with some differences. Players advance the game by controlling the protagonist Serge through the game's world, primarily by foot and boat. Navigation between areas is conducted via an [[overworld]] map, much like ''Chrono Trigger's'', depicting the landscape from a scaled-down overhead view. Around the island world are villages, outdoor areas, and dungeons, through which the player moves in three dimensions. Locations such as cities and forests are represented by more realistically scaled field maps, in which players can converse with locals to procure items and services, solve puzzles and challenges, or encounter enemies. Like ''Chrono Trigger'', the game features no [[random encounter]]s; enemies are openly visible on field maps or lie in wait to ambush the party.<ref name=\"perfect-10\">{{cite web|date=2000-01-06 |first=Andrew |last=Vestal |title=GameSpot: Chrono Cross Review |url=http://www.gamespot.com/chrono-cross/ |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2014-01-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107112812/http://www.gamespot.com/chrono-cross/ |archivedate=2014-01-07 }}</ref> Touching the monster switches perspectives to a battle screen, in which players can physically attack, use \"Elements\", defend, or run away from the enemy. Battles are turn-based, allowing the player infinite time to select an action from the available menu. For both the playable characters and the computer-controlled enemies, each attack reduces their number of [[hit point]]s (a numerically based [[life bar]]), which can be restored through some Elements. When a playable character loses all hit points, he or she faints. If all the player's characters fall in battle, the game ends and must be restored from a previously saved chapter\u2014except for specific storyline-related battles that allow the player to lose. ''Chrono Cross''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s developers aimed to break new ground in the genre, and the game features several innovations.<ref name=\"gameprointerview2\">{{cite web|date=2000-10-17|title=Interview with Chrono Cross Developers|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/6764/chrono-cross-development-team-interview-and-contest/|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=2006-07-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202153219/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/6764/chrono-cross-development-team-interview-and-contest/|archivedate=December 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref><ref name=\"gameprointerview\"/> For example, players can run away from all conflicts, including [[boss (video games)|boss]] fights and the final battle.<ref name=\"perfect-10\" />\n\n===Battle and Elements===\n[[File:Chronocrossbattlescreenshot.png|left|thumb|In battle, players can attack, use Elements, defend, or run away|alt=Two characters in foreground in battle poise, menu with \"Attack\", \"Element\", \"Defend\", \"Run Away\", boxes with health statistics for characters \"Serge\", \"Kid\", and \"Mel\", stone floor, gold robotic enemy facing the characters]]\nThe Element system of ''Chrono Cross'' handles all magic, consumable items, and character-specific abilities. Elements unleash magic effects upon the enemy or party and must be equipped for use, much like the materia of 1997's ''[[Final Fantasy&nbsp;VII]]''. Elements can be purchased from shops or found in treasure chests littered throughout areas. Once acquired, they are allocated to a grid whose size and shape are unique to each character. They are ranked according to eight tiers; certain high level Elements can only be assigned on equivalent tiers in a character's grid. As the game progresses, the grid expands, allowing more Elements to be equipped and higher tiers to be accessed. Elements are divided into six paired oppositional types, or \"colors,\" each with a natural effect. Red (fire/magma) opposes Blue (water/ice), Green (wind/flora) opposes Yellow (earth/lightning), and White (light/cosmos) opposes Black (darkness/gravity).<ref name=\"perfect-10\" /> Each character and enemy has an innate color, enhancing the power of using same-color Elements while also making them weak against elements of the opposite color. ''Chrono Cross'' also features a \"field effect\", which keeps track of Element color used in the upper corner of the battle screen. If the field is purely one color, characters are able to unleash a powerful summon element at the cost of one the player's stars. The field will also enhance the power of Elements of the colors present, while weakening Elements of the opposite colors. Characters also innately learn some special techniques (\"Techs\") that are unique to each character but otherwise act like Elements. Like ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'', characters can combine certain Techs to make more powerful Double or Triple Techs.<ref name=\"perfect-10\" /> Consumable Elements may be used to restore [[hit point]]s or heal [[status ailment]]s after battle.<ref name=\"perfect-10\" />\n\nAnother innovative aspect of ''Chrono Cross'' is its stamina bar.<ref name=\"perfect-10\" /> At the beginning of a battle, each character has seven points of stamina. When a character attacks or uses an Element, stamina is decreased proportionally to the potency of the attack. Stamina slowly recovers when the character defends or when other characters perform actions in battle. Characters with stamina below one point must wait to take action. Use of an Element reduces the user's stamina bar by seven stamina points; this often means that the user's stamina gauge falls into the negative and the character must wait longer than usual to recover. With each battle, players can enhance [[Attribute (role-playing games)|statistic]]s such as strength and defense. However, no system of [[experience point]]s exists; after four or five upgrades, statistics remain static until players defeat a [[boss (video game)|boss]]. This adds a star to a running count shown on the status screen, which allows for another few rounds of statistical increases.<ref name=\"perfect-10\" /> Players can equip characters with weapons, armor, helmets, and accessories for use in battle; for example, the \"Power Seal\" upgrades attack power. Items and equipment may be purchased or found on field maps, often in [[Power-up|treasure chests]]. Unlike Elements, weapons and armor cannot merely be purchased with money; instead, the player must obtain base materials\u2014such as copper, bronze, or bone\u2014for a blacksmith to forge for a fee. The items can later be disassembled into their original components at no cost.\n[[File:Navigatingelnido.png|right|thumb|Players navigate the game's tropical setting by boat|alt=\"Home World\", an archipelago featuring fishing settlements, a city, and a volcanic mountain range surrounding a stone fort]]\n\n===Parallel dimensions===\nThe existence of two major [[parallel universe (fiction)|parallel dimensions]], like time periods in ''Chrono Trigger'', plays a significant role in the game. Players must go back and forth between the worlds to recruit party members, obtain items, and advance the plot. Much of the population of either world have counterparts in the other; some party members can even visit their other versions. The player must often search for items or places found exclusively in one world. Events in one dimension sometimes have an impact in another\u2014for instance, cooling scorched ground on an island in one world allows vegetation to grow in the other world. This system assists the presentation of certain themes, including the questioning of the importance of one's past decisions and humanity's role in destroying the environment.<ref name=\"ignreview\">{{cite web|date=2000-08-15 |first=David |last=Zdyrko |title=Chrono Cross Review |url=http://psx.ign.com/articles/162/162503p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2006-07-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060810021705/http://psx.ign.com/articles/162/162503p1.html |archivedate=2006-08-10 }}</ref> Rounding out the notable facets of ''Chrono Cross''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s gameplay are the [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] option and multiple endings.

Each character is outfitted with an innate Element affinity and three unique special abilities that are learned over time. If taken to the world opposite their own, characters react to their counterparts (if available). Many characters tie in to crucial plot events. Since it is impossible to obtain all 45 characters in one playthrough, players must replay the game to witness everything. Through use of the [[New Game Plus|New Game+]] feature, players can ultimately obtain all characters on one save file.\n\n[[Serge (Chrono Cross)|Serge]], the game's protagonist, is a 17-year-old boy with blue hair who lives in the fishing village of Arni. One day, he slips into an alternate world in which he drowned ten years before. Determined to find the truth behind the incident, he follows a predestined course that leads him to save the world. He is assisted by [[Kid (Chrono Cross)|Kid]], a feisty, skilled thief who seeks the mythical Frozen Flame. Portrayed as willful and [[tomboy]]ish due to her rough, thieving past, she helps Serge sneak into Viper Manor in order to obtain the Frozen Flame. Kid vows to find and defeat [[Lynx (Chrono Cross)|Lynx]], an anthropomorphic panther who burned down her adopted mother's orphanage.\n\nLynx, a cruel agent of the supercomputer FATE, is bent on finding Serge and using his body as part of a greater plan involving the Frozen Flame. Lynx travels with [[Harle (Chrono Cross)|Harle]], a mysterious, playful girl dressed like a [[harlequin]]. Harle was sent by the Dragon God to shadow Lynx and one day steal the Frozen Flame from Chronopolis, a task she painfully fulfills despite being smitten with Serge.\n\nTo accomplish this goal, Harle helps Lynx manipulate the Acacia Dragoons, the powerful militia governing the islands of El Nido. As the Dragoons maintain order, they contend with Fargo, a former Dragoon turned pirate captain who holds a grudge against their leader, General Viper. Though tussling with Serge initially, the Acacia Dragoons\u2014whose ranks include the fierce warriors Karsh, Zoah, Marcy, and Glenn\u2014later assist him when the militaristic nation of Porre invades the archipelago. The invasion brings Norris and Grobyc to the islands, a heartful commander of an elite force and a prototype cyborg soldier, respectively, as they too seek the Frozen Flame.\n\n===Story===\n''Chrono Cross'' begins with Serge located in El Nido, a tropical archipelago inhabited by ancient natives, mainland colonists, and beings called Demi-humans. Serge slips into an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]] in which he drowned on the beach ten years prior, and meets the thief, \"Kid\". As his adventure proceeds from here, Serge is able to recruit a multitude of allies to his cause. While assisting Kid in a heist Viper Manor to steal the Frozen Flame, he learns that ten years before the present, the universe split into two dimensions\u2014one in which Serge lived, and one in which he perished.<ref name=\"split-dimensions\">{{cite video game|title=Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=2000-08-15|platform=PlayStation|level=Viper Manor|quote= '''Prophet''': In your home world, you survived to live a happy and prosperous life.

At Fort Dragonia the use of a Dragonian artifact called the Dragon Tear, Lynx switches bodies with Serge. Unaware of the switch, Kid confides in Lynx, who stabs her as the real Serge helplessly watches. Lynx boasts of his victory and banishes Serge to a strange realm called the Temporal Vortex. He takes Kid under his wing, brainwashing her to believe the real Serge (in Lynx's body) is her enemy. Serge escapes with help from [[Harle (Chrono Cross)|Harle]], although his new body turns him into a stranger in his own world, with all the allies he had gained up to that point abandoning him due to his new appearance. Discovering that his new body prevents him from traveling across the dimensions, he sets out to regain his former body and learn more of the universal split that occurred ten years earlier, gaining a new band of allies along the way.. He travels to a forbidden lagoon known as the Dead Sea\u2014a wasteland frozen in time, dotted with futuristic ruins.<ref name=\"dead-sea\">{{cite video game|title=Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=2000-08-15|platform= PlayStation|level=Dead Sea|quote='''Member''': The waves are at a standstill&nbsp;...

Charged with guarding the Dead Sea by an entity named FATE, Miguel and three visions of [[Crono (Chrono Trigger)|Crono]], [[Marle (Chrono Trigger)|Marle]], and [[Characters of Chrono Trigger#Lucca|Lucca]] from ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' explain that Serge's existence dooms ''Home'' world's future to destruction at the hands of Lavos. To prevent Serge from obtaining the Frozen Flame, FATE destroys the Dead Sea.\n\nAble to return to ''Another'' world, Serge allies with the Acacia Dragoons against Porre and locates that dimension's Dragon Tear, allowing him to return to his human form. He then enters the Sea of Eden, ''Another'' world's physical equivalent of the Dead Sea, finding a temporal research facility from the distant future called Chronopolis. Lynx and Kid are inside; Serge defeats Lynx and the supercomputer FATE, allowing the six Dragons of El Nido to steal the Frozen Flame and retire to Terra Tower, a massive structure raised from the sea floor. Kid falls into a coma, and Harle bids the party goodbye to fly with the Dragons. Serge regroups his party and tends to Kid, who remains comatose. Continuing his adventure, he obtains and cleanses the corrupted Masamune sword from ''Chrono Trigger''. He then uses the Dragon relics and shards of the Dragon Tears to create the mythic Element Chrono Cross. The spiritual power of the Masamune later allows him to lift Kid from her coma. At Terra Tower, the prophet of time, revealed to be Belthasar from ''Chrono Trigger'', visits him with visions of Crono, Marle, and Lucca. Serge learns that the time research facility Chronopolis created El Nido thousands of years ago after a catastrophic experimental failure drew it to the past.<ref name=\"remodeling\">{{cite video game |title=Chrono Cross|developer=Square|publisher=Square|date=2000-08-15|platform=PlayStation|level=Chronopolis|quote='''Ghost''': Originally, El Nido was nothing but ocean.

His father took him to find assistance at Marbule, but Serge's boat blew off course due to a raging magnetic storm caused by [[Schala]].

They acknowledged that Square would soon re-release ''Chrono Trigger'' as part of ''[[Final Fantasy Chronicles]]'', which would give players a chance to catch up on the story of ''Trigger'' before playing ''Cross''. Kato thought that using a different setting and cast for ''Chrono Cross'' would allow players unfamiliar with ''Chrono Trigger'' to play ''Cross'' without becoming confused.<ref name=\"ultimania\" /> The ''Chrono Cross'' team decided against integrating heavy use of [[time travel]] into the game, as they thought it would be \"rehashing and cranking up the volume of the last game\".<ref name=\"ultimania\" /> Masato Kato cited the belief, \"there's no use in making something similar to before {{sic}}\",<ref name=\"kato-acknowledgment\" /> and noted, \"we're not so weak nor cheap as to try to make something exactly the same as ''Trigger''&nbsp;... Accordingly, ''Chrono Cross'' is not ''Chrono Trigger 2''.

But in my view, the whole point in making ''Chrono Cross'' was to make a new ''Chrono'' with the best available skills and technologies of today. I never had any intentions of just taking the system from ''Trigger'' and moving it onto the PlayStation console. That's why I believe that ''Cross'' is ''Cross'', and NOT ''Trigger 2''.<ref name=\"kato-acknowledgment\" />|Masato Kato}}\n\n{{quote|When creating a series, one method is to carry over a basic system, improving upon it as the series progresses, but our stance has been to create a completely new and different world from the ground up, and to restructure the former style. Therefore, ''Chrono Cross'' is not a sequel to ''Chrono Trigger''. Had it been, it would have been called ''Chrono Trigger 2''. Our main objective for ''Chrono Cross'' was to share a little bit of the ''Chrono Trigger'' worldview, while creating a completely different game as a means of providing new entertainment to the player. This is mainly due to the transition in platform generation from the SNES to the PS. The method I mentioned above, about improving upon a basic system, has inefficiencies, in that it's impossible to maximize the console's performance as the console continues to make improvements in leaps and bounds. Although essentially an RPG, at its core, it is a computer game, and I believe that games should be expressed with a close connection to the console's performance. Therefore, in regards to game development, our goal has always been to \"express the game utilizing the maximum performance of the console at that time.\" I strongly believe that anything created in this way will continue to be innovative.<ref name=\"gameprointerview2\" />|Hiromichi Tanaka}}\n\nFull production began on ''Chrono Cross'' in mid-1998.<ref name=\"gameprointerview\"/> The ''Chrono Cross'' team reached 80 members at its peak, with additional personnel of 10\u201320 cut-scene artists and 100 quality assurance testers.<ref name=\"gameprointerview\" /> The team felt pressure to live up to the work of ''Chrono Trigger''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Dream Team\" development group, which included famous Japanese [[Mangaka|manga artist]] [[Akira Toriyama]].<ref name=\"weeklyfamitsu\" /> Kato and Tanaka hired [[Nobuteru Y\u016bki]] for character design and [[Yasuyuki Honne]] for art direction and concept art.<ref>{{cite video game |title=Chrono Cross |developer=[[Square Co., Ltd.]] |publisher=Square Co., Ltd. |date=1999-11-18 |language=Japanese}}</ref> The event team originally envisioned a short game, and planned a system by which players would befriend any person in a town for alliance in battle.<ref name=\"ultimania\" /> Developers brainstormed traits and archetypes during the character-creation process, originally planning 64 characters with unique endings that could vary in three different ways per character.<ref name=\"gameprointerview\" /><ref name=\"ultimania\" /> Kato described the character creation process: \"Take Pierre, for example: we started off by saying we wanted a wacko fake hero like Tata from ''Trigger''.

Advocates of economic planning have sometimes been staunch critics of these command economies. For example, [[Leon Trotsky]] believed that those at the top of the chain of command, regardless of their intellectual capacity, operated without the input and participation of the millions of people who participate in the economy and who understand/respond to local conditions and changes in the economy, and therefore would be unable to effectively coordinate all economic activity.<ref>{{cite book |title= Writings 1932\u201333 |page= 96 |first= Leon |last= Trotsky }}</ref>\n\nAlthough historians have associated planned economies with [[Marxist-Leninist]] states and the [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet economic model]], some argue{{weasel-inline|date=January 2018}} that the Soviet economic model did not actually constitute a planned economy in that a comprehensive and binding plan did not guide production and investment; therefore the further distinction of an ''administrative command economy'' emerged as a more accurate designation for the economic system that existed in the former [[Soviet Union]] and [[Eastern bloc]], highlighting the role of centralized hierarchical decision-making in the absence of popular control over the economy.<ref name=\"The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning\">{{cite book |last= Ellman |first= Michael |chapter= The Rise and Fall of Socialist Planning |title= Transition and Beyond: Essays in Honour of Mario Nuti |editor1-first= Saul |editor1-last= Estrin |editor2-first= Grzegorz W. |editor2-last= Ko\u0142odko |editor3-first= Milica |editor3-last= Uvali\u0107 |location= New York |publisher= Palgrave Macmillan |year= 2007 |isbn= 0-230-54697-8 |page= 22 |quote= Realization of these facts led in the 1970s and 1980s to the development of new terms to describe what had previously been (and still were in United Nations publications) referred to as the 'centrally planned economies'.

[[Indicative planning]] is a form of planning in market economies that directs the economy through incentive-based methods. Economic planning can be practiced in a decentralized manner through different government authorities. For example, in some predominately market-oriented and mixed economies,{{which?|date=September 2018}} the state utilizes economic planning in strategic industries such as the aerospace industry. Mixed economies usually employ [[macroeconomics | macroeconomic]] planning, while micro-economic affairs are left to the market and price system.\n\nNote too the utilization of [[dirigisme]], or government direction of the economy through non-coercive means, as practiced in France and in Great Britain after the [[Second World War]].

Consumer demand can be restrained in favor of greater capital investment for economic development in a desired pattern. In international comparisons, state-socialist nations compared favorably with capitalist nations in health indicators such as infant mortality and life expectancy, although the statistics concerning infant mortality are self-reported and based on varying standards.<ref>[[Michael Ellman]] (2014).

This difficulty was notably written about by economists [[Ludwig von Mises]] and [[Friedrich Hayek]], who referred to subtly distinct aspects of the problem as the \"[[economic calculation problem]]\"<ref name=\"Mises\">{{cite book\n|title= Economic calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth\n|accessdate=2008-09-08\n|last= Von Mises\n|first= Ludwig\n|authorlink= Ludwig von Mises\n|year= 1990\n|format= pdf\n|publisher= [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]]\n|url= http://library.freecapitalists.org/books/Ludwig%20von%20Mises/Economic%20Calculation%20in%20the%20Socialist%20Commonwealth.pdf\n}}</ref> and \"[[local knowledge problem]]\"<ref name=\"AER519-30\">Friedrich A.

Whereas the former stressed the theoretical underpinnings of a market economy to subjective value theory while attacking the labor theory of value, the latter argued that the only way to satisfy individuals who have a constantly changing hierarchy of needs, and are the only ones to possess their particular individual's circumstances, is by allowing those with the most knowledge of their needs to have it in their power to use their resources in a competing marketplace to meet the needs of the most consumers, most efficiently. This phenomenon is recognized as [[spontaneous order]]. Additionally, misallocation of resources would naturally ensue by redirecting capital away from individuals with direct knowledge and circumventing it into markets where a coercive monopoly influences behavior, ignoring market signals. According to Tibor R. Machan, \"Without a market in which allocations can be made in obedience to the law of supply and demand, it is difficult or impossible to funnel resources with respect to actual human preferences and goals.\"<ref name=tibor2001>{{cite book |last=Machan |first=R.

But they could never have delivered economic self-management, they would always have been slow to innovate as apathy and frustration took their inevitable toll, and they would always have been susceptible to growing inequities and inefficiencies as the effects of differential economic power grew. Under central planning neither planners, managers, nor workers had incentives to promote the social economic interest. Nor did impeding markets for final goods to the planning system enfranchise consumers in meaningful ways. But central planning would have been incompatible with economic democracy even if it had overcome its information and incentive liabilities. And the truth is that it survived as long as it did only because it was propped up by unprecedented totalitarian political power.\"<ref name=\"Hahnel, Robin 2002\"/>\n\n===Economic instability===\nStudies of Eastern European planned economies in the 1950s and 1960s by both American and Eastern European economists found that, contrary to the expectations of both groups, they showed greater fluctuations in [[Output (economics)|output]] than market economies during the same period.<ref name=\"Economic Reforms in Polish Industry\">{{cite book |last=Zielinski |first=J.

The goal of such an economic system would be to achieve conscious control over the economy by the population, specifically, so that the use of the [[surplus product]] is controlled by the producers.<ref>{{cite book |last= Feinstein|first= C.H. |title= Socialism, Capitalism and Economic Growth: Essays Presented to Maurice Dobb |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year= 1975|isbn=0-521-29007-4 |page= 174|quote=We have presented the view that planning and market mechanisms are instruments that can be used both in socialist and non-socialist societies...It was important to explode the primitive identification of central planning and socialism and to stress the instrumental character of planning.}}</ref> The specific forms of planning proposed for socialism and their feasibility are subjects of the [[socialist calculation debate]].\n\n== Computational economic planning ==\nIn their book ''Towards a New Socialism'' (1993) the computer scientist [[Paul Cockshott]] from the [[University of Glasgow]] and the economist Allin Cottrell from the [[Wake Forest University]] claim to demonstrate, in detail, how a democratically planned economy built on modern computer technology is possible and drives the thesis that it would be both economically more stable than the free market economies and also morally desirable.\n\nIn 1971, when the development of computer technology was still its early stages, the socialist [[Salvador Allende|Allende]] administration of Chile launched [[Project Cybersyn]] to install a telex machine in every corporation and organisation in the economy for the communication of economic data between firms and the government. The data was also fed into a computer simulated economy for forecasting. A control room was built for realtime observation and management of the overall economy. The project was initially successful{{Citation needed|reason=any data?|date=June 2018}} but in 1973, after CIA-backed [[Augusto Pinochet]] led a coup and then established a dictatorship under his rule, he abolished the program to move Chile towards a freer economy.\n\n==Fictional portrayals of planned economies==\nThe 1888 novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' by [[Edward Bellamy]] depicts a fictional planned economy in a United States around the year 2000 which has become a socialist utopia.\n\n[[The World State]] in Aldous Huxley's ''[[Brave New World]]'' and [[Airstrip One]] in George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' are both fictional examples of command economies, albeit with diametrically opposed aims: The former is a [[consumer economy]] designed to engender productivity while the latter is a [[shortage economy]] designed as an agent of totalitarian social control. Airstrip One is organised by the euphemistically named Ministry of Plenty.\n\nOther literary portrayals of planned economies were [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]]'s ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', which was an influence on Orwell's work. Like ''Nineteen Eighty Four'', [[Ayn Rand]]'s dystopian story ''[[Anthem (novella)|Anthem]]'' was also an artistic portrayal of a command economy that was influenced by ''We''. The difference is that it was a [[primitivist]] planned economy, as opposed to the advanced technology of ''We'' or ''[[Brave New World]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Calculation in kind]]\n* [[Communist state]]\n* [[Communist economy]]\n* [[Dirigisme]]\n* [[Distributed economy]]\n* [[Economic democracy]]\n* [[Economic equilibrium]]\n* [[Economic calculation problem]]\n* [[Economic planning]]\n* [[Horizontalidad]]\n* [[Inclusive democracy]]\n* [[Indicative planning]]\n* [[Industrial democracy]]\n* [[Input-output model]]\n* [[Material balance planning]]\n* [[Market economy]]\n* [[Marxism-Leninism]]\n* [[Mixed economy]]\n* [[Participatory economics]]\n* [[Production for use]]\n* [[Project Cybersyn]]\n* [[Public ownership]]\n* [[Social peer-to-peer processes#P2P economic system|Peer-to-Peer economy]]\n* [[Socialist calculation debate]]\n* [[Socialism|Socialist economy]]\n* [[State capitalism]]\n* [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|Technocracy]]\n* [[Workers' self-management|Self-managed economy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n;Case studies (Soviet-type economies)\n* [[Analysis of Soviet-type economic planning]]\n* [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Five-year plans of China]] \n* [[OGAS]], a plan for creating a computer network to supervise the Soviet economy\n* [[Project Cybersyn]], a project for a computer network controlling the economy of Chile under [[Salvador Allende]].\n* [[Eastern Bloc economies]]\n*[[Economy of Cuba|Cuban Planned Economy]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/12/18/archives/the-cuban-economy-how-it-works-the-economy-of-cuba-how-it-works.html|title=The Cuban Economy: How It Works|last=Crittenden|first=Ann|access-date=2018-06-29|language=en}}</ref>\n* [[Economy of Venezuela]]\n\n;Case studies (Mixed-market economies)\n* [[Dirigisme|Indicative planning in France]]\n* [[First Malaysia Plan]]\n* [[Five-year plans of Argentina]]\n* [[Five-Year Plans of South Korea]]\n* [[Economy of Singapore]]\n* [[Economy of India]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Michael Ellman]] (2014).

The species lives in a male-dominated, strict hierarchy, which means disputes can generally be settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear [[Senegal bushbaby|Senegal bushbabies]] out of small holes in trees.\n\nThe common chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range in the forests and savannahs of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]].

Some people do not experience symptoms until their early 30s or 40s. Usually, the initial symptom is [[foot drop]] early in the course of the disease. This can also cause [[hammer toe]], where the toes are always curled. Wasting of muscle tissue of the lower parts of the legs may give rise to a \"stork leg\" or \"inverted champagne bottle\" appearance. Weakness in the hands and forearms occurs in many people as the disease progresses.\n\nLoss of touch sensation in the feet, ankles, and legs, as well as in the hands, wrists, and arms occurs with various types of the disease. Early- and late-onset forms occur with 'on and off' painful spasmodic muscular contractions that can be disabling when the disease activates.  High-arched feet ([[pes cavus]]) or flat-arched feet ([[pes planus]]) are classically associated with the disorder.<ref name=\"LeBhushan2014\">{{cite book|last1=Le|first1=Tao|last2=Bhushan|first2=Vikas|title=First Aid for the USMLE Step 1 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yJ-mgEACAAJ|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=6 January 2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780071831420|quote=Typically autosomal dominant inheritance pattern associated with scoliosis and foot deformities (high or flat arches).}}</ref> Sensory and proprioceptive nerves in the hands and feet are often damaged, while unmyelinated pain nerves are left intact.

Nerve signals are conducted by an [[axon]] with a [[myelin]] sheath wrapped around it. Most mutations in CMT affect the myelin sheath, but some affect the axon.\n\nThe most common cause of CMT (70\u201380% of the cases) is the duplication of a large region on the short arm of [[chromosome 17]] that includes the gene ''[[PMP22]]''. Some mutations affect the gene ''[[MFN2]]'', which codes for a mitochondrial protein. Cells contain separate sets of genes in their [[cell nucleus|nuclei]] and [[mitochondria]]. In nerve cells, the mitochondria travel down the long axons. In some forms of CMT, mutated ''MFN2'' causes the mitochondria to form large clusters, or clots, which are unable to travel down the axon towards the [[synapses]]. This prevents the synapses from functioning.<ref name=\"Baloh\">{{cite journal |pages=422\u201330 |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4798-06.2007 |title=Altered Axonal Mitochondrial Transport in the Pathogenesis of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease from Mitofusin 2 Mutations |year=2007 |last1=Baloh |first1=R.

Another cell involved in CMT is the [[Schwann cell]], which creates the myelin sheath, by wrapping its plasma membrane around the axon.<ref name=Berger>{{cite journal |pages=1\u201315 |doi= 10.1007/s10048-002-0130-z |title=Molecular cell biology of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease |year=2002 |last1=Berger |first1=Philipp |last2=Young |first2=Peter |last3=Suter |first3=Ueli |journal=Neurogenetics |volume=4 |pmid=12030326 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\nNeurons, Schwann cells, and [[fibroblast]]s work together to create a functional nerve. Schwann cells and neurons exchange molecular signals that regulate survival and differentiation. These signals are disrupted in CMT.<ref name=Berger/>\n\nDemyelinating Schwann cells causes abnormal axon structure and function. They may cause axon degeneration, or they may simply cause axons to malfunction.<ref name=Krajewski/>\n\nThe myelin sheath allows nerve cells to conduct signals faster. When the myelin sheath is damaged, nerve signals are slower, and this can be measured by a common neurological test, [[electromyography]]. When the axon is damaged, though, this results in a reduced compound muscle [[action potential]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yiu |first=Eppie M. |last2=Burns |first2=Joshua |last3=Ryan |first3=Monique M. |last4=Ouvrier |first4=Robert A. |year=2008 |title=Neurophysiologic abnormalities in children with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A |journal=Journal of the Peripheral Nervous System |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=236\u201341 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8027.2008.00182.x |pmid=18844790}}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nCMT can be diagnosed through symptoms, through measurement of the speed of nerve impulses ([[nerve conduction studies]]), through [[biopsy]] of the nerve, and through DNA testing. DNA testing can give a definitive diagnosis, but not all the [[genetic marker]]s for CMT are known.  CMT is first noticed when someone develops lower leg weakness, such as foot drop, or foot deformities, including hammertoes and high arches, but signs alone do not lead to diagnosis.  Patients must be referred to a physician specialising in neurology or rehabilitation medicine. To see signs of muscle weakness, the neurologist asks patients to walk on their heels or to move part of their leg against an opposing force.  To identify sensory loss, the neurologist tests for deep-tendon reflexes, such as the knee jerk, which are reduced or absent in CMT. The doctor also asks about family history, because CMT is hereditary.  The lack of family history does not rule out CMT, but helps rule out other causes of neuropathy, such as diabetes or exposure to certain chemicals or drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.charcot-marie-tooth.org/about_cmt/diagnosis.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100912/http://www.charcot-marie-tooth.org/about_cmt/diagnosis.php |archivedate=2010-02-27 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, CMT was one of the first diseases where the genetic cause of a particular patient's disease was precisely determined by sequencing the whole genome of an affected individual.

Physical therapy should be involved in designing an exercise program that fits a person's personal strengths and flexibility. Bracing can also be used to correct problems caused by CMT. An orthotist may address gait abnormalities by prescribing the use of [[ankle-foot orthoses]]. These orthoses help control foot drop and ankle instability and often provide a better sense of balance for patients. Appropriate footwear is also very important for people with CMT, but they often have difficulty finding well-fitting shoes because of their high arched feet and hammer toes. Due to the lack of good sensory reception in the feet, CMT patients may also need to see a podiatrist for help in trimming nails or removing calluses that develop on the pads of the feet. A final decision a patient can make is to have surgery. Using a podiatrist or an orthopedic surgeon, patients can choose to stabilize their feet or correct progressive problems. These procedures include straightening and pinning the toes, lowering the arch, and sometimes, fusing the ankle joint to provide stability.<ref name=cmtausaTreat/> CMT patients must take extra care to avoid falling because fractures take longer to heal in someone with an underlying disease process.

In the context of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] low plasma sodium (hyponatremia), the brain compensates by decreasing the levels of these osmolytes within the cells, so that they can remain relatively isotonic with their surroundings and not absorb too much fluid. The reverse is true in hypernatremia, in which the cells increase their intracellular osmolytes so as not to lose too much fluid to the extracellular space.\n\nWith correction of the hyponatremia with [[intravenous fluids]], the extracellular tonicity increases, followed by an increase in intracellular tonicity. When the correction is too rapid, not enough time is allowed for the brain's cells to adjust to the new tonicity, namely by increasing the intracellular osmoles mentioned earlier. If the serum sodium levels rise too rapidly, the increased extracellular tonicity will continue to drive water out of the brain's cells.

The positions of atoms or molecules occur on repeating fixed distances, determined by the unit cell parameters.

They are not extended in space in any dimension. Strict limits for how small a point defect is are generally not defined explicitly. However, these defects typically involve at most a few extra or missing atoms. Larger defects in an ordered structure are usually considered [[dislocation]] loops. For historical reasons, many point defects, especially in ionic crystals, are called ''centers'': for example a vacancy in many ionic solids is called a luminescence center, a color center, or [[F-center]]. These dislocations permit ionic transport through crystals leading to electrochemical reactions. These are frequently specified using [[Kr\u00f6ger\u2013Vink Notation]].\n\n*[[Vacancy defect]]s are lattice sites which would be occupied in a perfect crystal, but are vacant. If a neighboring atom moves to occupy the vacant site, the vacancy moves in the opposite direction to the site which used to be occupied by the moving atom. The stability of the surrounding crystal structure guarantees that the neighboring atoms will not simply collapse around the vacancy. In some materials, neighboring atoms actually move away from a vacancy, because they experience attraction from atoms in the surroundings. A vacancy (or pair of vacancies in an ionic solid) is sometimes called a [[Schottky defect]].\n*[[Interstitial defect]]s are atoms that occupy a site in the crystal structure at which there is usually not an atom. They are generally high energy configurations. Small atoms in some crystals can occupy interstices without high energy, such as [[hydrogen]] in [[palladium]].\n\n[[Image:defecttypes.png|right|thumb|Schematic illustration of some simple point defect types in a monatomic solid]]\n\n*A nearby pair of a vacancy and an interstitial is often called a [[Frenkel defect]] or Frenkel pair. This is caused when an ion moves into an interstitial site and creates a vacancy.\n\n{{anchor|substit}}\n*Due to fundamental limitations of material purification methods, materials are never 100% pure, which by definition induces defects in crystal structure. In the case of an impurity, the atom is often incorporated at a regular atomic site in the crystal structure.  This is neither a vacant site nor is the atom on an interstitial site and it is called a ''substitutional'' defect. The atom is not supposed to be anywhere in the crystal, and is thus an impurity. In some cases where the radius of the substitutional atom (ion) is substantially smaller than that of the atom (ion) it is replacing, its equilibrium position can be shifted away from the lattice site. These types of substitutional defects are often referred to as [[off-center ions]]. There are two different types of substitutional defects: Isovalent substitution and aliovalent substitution. Isovalent substitution is where the ion that is substituting the original ion is of the same oxidation state as the ion it is replacing. Aliovalent substitution is where the ion that is substituting the original ion is of a different oxidation state than the ion it is replacing. Aliovalent substitutions change the overall charge within the ionic compound, but the ionic compound must be neutral. Therefore, a charge compensation mechanism is required. Hence either one of the metals is partially or fully oxidised or reduced, or ion vacancies are created.\n*'''Antisite defects'''<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=10058001|year=1995|last1=Mattila|first1=T|last2=Nieminen|first2=RM|title=Direct Antisite Formation in Electron Irradiation of GaAs|volume=74|issue=14|pages=2721\u20132724|journal=Physical Review Letters|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.74.2721|bibcode=1995PhRvL..74.2721M|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/17579}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.54.8527|title=Point defects and their reactions in electron-irradiated GaAs investigated by optical absorption spectroscopy|year=1996|last1=Hausmann|first1=H.|last2=Pillukat|first2=A.|last3=Ehrhart|first3=P.|journal=Physical Review B|volume=54|pages=8527\u20138539|bibcode = 1996PhRvB..54.8527H|issue=12 }}</ref> occur in an ordered alloy or compound when atoms of different type exchange positions. For example, some alloys have a regular structure in which every other atom is a different species; for illustration assume that type A atoms sit on the corners of a cubic lattice, and type B atoms sit in the center of the cubes. If one cube has an A atom at its center, the atom is on a site usually occupied by a B atom, and is thus an antisite defect. This is neither a vacancy nor an interstitial, nor an impurity.\n*Topological defects are regions in a crystal where the normal chemical bonding environment is topologically different from the surroundings. For instance, in a perfect sheet of graphite ([[graphene]]) all atoms are in rings containing six atoms. If the sheet contains regions where the number of atoms in a ring is different from six, while the total number of atoms remains the same, a topological defect has formed. An example is the [[Stone Wales defect]] in nanotubes, which consists of two adjacent 5-membered and two 7-membered atom rings.\n\n[[Image:compounddefects.png|right|thumb|Schematic illustration of defects in a compound solid, using GaAs as an example.]]\n\n*Also [[amorphous]] solids may contain defects. These are naturally somewhat hard to define, but sometimes their nature can be quite easily understood. For instance, in ideally bonded amorphous [[silica]] all Si atoms have 4 bonds to O atoms and all O atoms have 2 bonds to Si atom. Thus e.g. an O atom with only one Si bond (a [[dangling bond]]) can be considered a defect in silica.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00107510601088156|title=Luminescence of ion-irradiated \u03b1-quartz|year=2006|last1=Lieb|first1=Klaus-Peter|last2=Keinonen|first2=Juhani|journal=Contemporary Physics|volume=47|pages=305\u2013331|bibcode = 2006ConPh..47..305L|issue=5 }}</ref> Moreover, defects can also be defined in amorphous solids based on empty or densely packed local atomic neighbourhoods, and the properties of such 'defects' can be shown to be similar to normal vacancies and interstitials in crystals.<ref name=\"Ash12\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/nl301554k|title=Irradiation Induced Grain Boundary Flow\u2014A New Creep Mechanism at the Nanoscale|issue=8|pages=4084\u20139|year=2012|last1=Ashkenazy|first1=Yinon|last2=Averback|first2=Robert S.|journal=Nano Letters|volume=12|pmid=22775230|bibcode = 2012NanoL..12.4084A }}</ref><ref name=\"May03\" /><ref name=\"Nor05\">{{cite journal|title=Strings and interstitials in liquids, glasses and crystals|journal=Europhys.

The dislocation line is presented in blue, the Burgers vector b in black.]]\n\nEdge dislocations are caused by the termination of a plane of atoms in the middle of a crystal. In such a case, the adjacent planes are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. The analogy with a stack of paper is apt: if a half a piece of paper is inserted in a stack of paper, the defect in the stack is only noticeable at the edge of the half sheet.\n\nThe screw dislocation is more difficult to visualise, but basically comprises a structure in which a helical path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes of atoms in the crystal lattice.\n\nThe presence of dislocation results in lattice strain (distortion). The direction and magnitude of such distortion is expressed in terms of a [[Burgers vector]] (b). For an edge type, b is perpendicular to the dislocation line, whereas in the cases of the screw type it is parallel. In metallic materials, b is aligned with close-packed crystallographic directions and its magnitude is equivalent to one interatomic spacing.\n\nDislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge.\n\nIt is the presence of dislocations and their ability to readily move (and interact) under the influence of stresses induced by external loads that leads to the characteristic [[malleability]] of metallic materials.\n\nDislocations can be observed using [[transmission electron microscopy]], [[field ion microscopy]] and [[atom probe]] techniques.\n[[DLTS|Deep level transient spectroscopy]] has been used for studying the electrical activity of dislocations in semiconductors, mainly [[silicon]].\n\n[[Disclination]]s are line defects corresponding to \"adding\" or \"subtracting\" an angle around a line. Basically, this means that if you track the crystal orientation around the line defect, you get a rotation. Usually, they were thought to play a role only in liquid crystals, but recent developments suggest that they might have a role also in solid materials, e.g. leading to the self-healing of [[Fracture|cracks]].<ref>[http://www.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/tension-can-fuse-metal-1009.html Chandler, David L., ''Cracked metal, heal thyself,'' MIT news, October 9, 2013]</ref>\n\n==Planar defects==<!-- This section is linked from [[Semiconductor]] -->\n\n[[File:Schema fcc hcp.png|thumbnail|Origin of stacking faults: Different stacking sequences of close-packed crystals]]\n\n*[[Grain boundary|Grain boundaries]] occur where the crystallographic direction of the lattice abruptly changes. This usually occurs when two crystals begin growing separately and then meet.\n*Antiphase boundaries occur in ordered alloys: in this case, the crystallographic direction remains the same, but each side of the boundary has an opposite phase: For example, if the ordering is usually ABABABAB ([[hexagonal close-packed]] crystal), an antiphase boundary takes the form of ABABBABA.\n*[[Stacking fault]]s occur in a number of crystal structures, but the common example is in [[Close-packing|close-packed]] structures. They are formed by a local deviation of the stacking sequence of layers in a crystal. An example would be the ABABCABAB stacking sequence.\n*A [[twin boundary]] is a defect that introduces a plane of mirror symmetry in the ordering of a crystal. For example, in [[cubic close-packed]] crystals, the stacking sequence of a twin boundary would be ABCABCBACBA.\n*On planer of  [[single crystal]]s, steps between atomically flat terraces can also be regarded as planar defects.

The table shows which orderings are admitted.\n\nMoreover, the worst-case bloat in grammar size<ref group=note>i.e. written length, measured in symbols</ref> depends on the transformation order. Using |''G''| to denote the size of the original grammar ''G'', the size blow-up in the worst case may range from |''G''|<sup>2</sup> to 2<sup>2 |G|</sup>, depending on the transformation algorithm used.<ref name=\"Lange.Leis.2009\"/>{{rp|7}} The blow-up in grammar size depends on the order between '''DEL''' and '''BIN'''.

It was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 10 September 1996, but has not entered into force, as eight specific states have not ratified the treaty.\n\n==History==\nThe movement for international control of [[nuclear weapon]]s began in 1945, with a call from [[Canada]] and [[United Kingdom]] for a conference on the subject.{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=56}} In June 1946, [[Bernard Baruch]], an emissary of President [[Harry S. Truman]], proposed the [[Baruch Plan]] before the [[United Nations Atomic Energy Commission]], which called for an international system of controls on the production of atomic energy. The plan, which would serve as the basis for [[United States]] nuclear policy into the 1950s, was rejected by the [[Soviet Union]] as a US ploy to cement its nuclear dominance.{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=7}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|pp=57\u201358}}\n\nBetween the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] of 16 July 1945 and the signing of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] (PTBT) on 5 August 1963, 499 nuclear tests were conducted.<ref name=delcoigne>{{cite web |title=The Test Ban Treaty |last=Delcoigne |first=G.C. |publisher=IAEA |page=18 |url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/publications/magazines/bulletin/bull15-4/15403500322.pdf |access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref> Much of the impetus for the PTBT, the precursor to the CTBT, was rising public concern surrounding the size and resulting [[nuclear fallout]] from underwater and atmospheric nuclear tests, particularly tests of powerful [[thermonuclear weapons]] (hydrogen bombs). The [[Castle Bravo]] test of 1 March 1954, in particular, attracted significant attention as the detonation resulted in fallout that spread over inhabited areas and sickened a group of Japanese fishermen.<ref name=atomicheritage>{{cite web |title=Limited or Partial Test Ban Treaty (LTBT/PTBT) |publisher=[[Atomic Heritage Foundation]] |url=http://www.atomicheritage.org/history/limited-or-partial-test-ban-treaty-ltbtptbt |access-date=1 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=nsarchive>{{cite web |title=The Making of the Limited Test Ban Treaty, 1958\u20131963 |last1=Burr |first1=William |last2=Montford |first2=Hector L. |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |date=3 August 2003 |url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB94/ |access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"nti\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nti.org/learn/treaties-and-regimes/treaty-banning-nuclear-test-atmosphere-outer-space-and-under-water-partial-test-ban-treaty-ptbt/|title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water (Partial Test Ban Treaty) (PTBT)|date=26 October 2011|publisher=[[Nuclear Threat Initiative]]|access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref>{{sfn|Rhodes|2005|p=542}}{{sfn|Strode|1990|p=31}} Between 1945 and 1963, the US conducted 215 atmospheric tests, the Soviet Union conducted 219, the UK conducted 21, and [[France]] conducted three.<ref name=nrdc>{{cite web |title=Archive of Nuclear Data |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |publisher=[[Natural Resources Defense Council]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010072829/http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nudb/datab15.asp |archive-date=10 October 2007 |access-date=6 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, following the Castle Bravo test, Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] of [[India]] issued the first appeal for a \"standstill agreement\" on testing, which was soon echoed by the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=247}}{{sfn|Polsby|1984|p=58}}<ref name=bravo>{{cite web |title=1 March 1954 \u2013 Castle Bravo |publisher=Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization |url=https://www.ctbto.org/specials/testing-times/1-march-1954-castle-bravo/ |access-date=31 July 2016}}</ref> Negotiations on a comprehensive test ban, primarily involved the US, UK, and Soviet Union, began in 1955 following a proposal by Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]].{{sfn|Rhodes|2008|p=72}}{{sfn|Reeves|1993|p=121}} Of primary concern throughout the negotiations, which would stretch with some interruptions to July 1963, was the system of verifying compliance with the test ban and detecting illicit tests. On the Western side, there were concerns that the Soviet Union would be able to circumvent any test ban and secretly leap ahead in the [[nuclear arms race]].{{sfn|Burns|Siracusa|2013|p=305}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1991|pp=457\u2013458}}{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=8\u20139}} These fears were amplified following the US [[Operation Plumbbob|''Rainier'']] shot of 19 September 1957, which was the first contained underground test of a nuclear weapon. Though the US held a significant advantage in underground testing capabilities, there was worry that the Soviet Union would be able to covertly conduct underground tests during a test ban, as underground detonations were more difficult to detect than above-ground tests.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|p=9}}{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|pp=85\u201386}} On the Soviet side, conversely, the on-site compliance inspections demanded by the US and UK were seen as amounting to espionage.{{sfn|Evangelista|1999|p=79}} Disagreement over verification would lead to the Anglo-American and Soviet negotiators abandoning a comprehensive test ban (i.e., a ban on all tests, including those underground) in favor of a partial ban, which would be finalized on 25 July 1963. The PTBT, joined by 123 states following the original three parties, banned detonations for military and civilian purposes underwater, in the atmosphere, and in outer space.{{sfn|Schlesinger|2002|pp=905\u2013906, 910}}<ref name=siglist>{{cite web |title=Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty & Partial Test Ban Treaty Membership |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/apmctbt_10.pdf |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=11 August 2016 |date=8 June 2015}}</ref><ref name=unoda>{{cite web |title=Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and Under Water |publisher=[[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]] |access-date=11 August 2016 |url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/test_ban/text}}</ref>\n\nThe PTBT had mixed results.

To verify compliance, the PNET requires that states rely on [[national technical means of verification]], share information on explosions, and grant on-site access to counterparties.

These three nuclear powers made notable progress in the late 1970s, agreeing to terms on a ban on all testing, including a temporary prohibition on PNEs, but continued disagreements over the compliance mechanisms led to an end to negotiations ahead of [[Ronald Reagan]]'s inauguration as President in 1981.<ref name=faschron /> In 1985, Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] announced a unilateral testing moratorium, and in December 1986, Reagan reaffirmed US commitment to pursue the long-term goal of a comprehensive test ban.

Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including [[martial arts]], [[gymnastics]], [[cheerleading]], [[figure skating]], [[synchronized swimming]], marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.\n\n==Performance and participation==\n[[File:GDC onlywayaround.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Members of an American jazz dance company perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting]]\n\nTheatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a [[performance]] upon a [[Stage (theater)|stage]] by [[virtuoso]] dancers. It often tells a [[narrative|story]], perhaps using [[Mime artist|mime]], [[Dance costumes|costume]] and [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]], or else it may simply [[Interpretive dance|interpret the musical accompaniment]], which is often specially composed. Examples are western [[ballet]] and [[modern dance]], [[Classical Indian dance]] and Chinese and Japanese song and dance dramas. Most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in [[opera]] and other forms of [[musical theatre]].\n\nParticipatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a [[folk dance]], a [[social dance]], a [[group dance]] such as a [[Line dance|line]], [[Circle dance|circle]], [[Medieval dance#Other Chain Dances|chain]] or [[square dance]], or a [[partner dance]] such as is common in western [[Ballroom dance|Western ballroom dancing]], is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as [[social interaction]] or [[exercise]], of participants rather than onlookers. Such dance seldom has any narrative. A group dance and a ''[[corps de ballet]]'', a social partner dance and a ''[[pas de deux]]'', differ profoundly. Even a [[solo dance]] may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. Participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the [[rave culture]] of [[electronic dance music]], vast crowds may engage in [[free dance]], uncoordinated with those around them. On the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.\n\n==Origins==\n[[File:Dancing painting at Bhimbetka.jpg|thumb|left|Mesolithic dancers at Bhimbetka]]\n\n[[archeology|Archeological]] evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in [[India]] at the [[Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka]], and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 BC.

[[Bharata Muni]]'s ''[[Natyashastra]]'' (literally ''\"the text of dramaturgy\"'') is one of the earlier texts. It mainly deals with drama, in which dance plays an important part in Indian culture. It categorizes dance into four types - secular, ritual, abstract, and, interpretive - and into four regional varieties. The text elaborates various hand-gestures (''[[mudras]]'') and classifies movements of the various limbs, steps and so on. A strong continuous tradition of dance has since continued in India, through to modern times, where it continues to play a role in culture, ritual, and, notably, the [[Bollywood]] entertainment industry. Many other contemporary dance forms can likewise be traced back to [[Historical dance|historical]], [[Traditional dance|traditional]], [[Ceremonial dance|ceremonial]], and [[List of dances sorted by ethnicity|ethnic]] dance.\n\n==Dance and music==\n{{main|Dance music}}\n\nDance is generally, though not exclusively, performed with the accompaniment of music and may or may not be performed ''in [[time signature|time]]'' to such music. Some dance (such as [[tap dance]]) may provide its own audible accompaniment in place of (or in addition to) music. Many early forms of music and dance were created for each other and are frequently performed together. Notable examples of traditional dance/music couplings include the [[jig]], [[waltz]], [[Tango music|tango]], [[disco]], and [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]]. Some [[musical genre]]s have a parallel dance form such as [[baroque music]] and [[baroque dance]]; other varieties of dance and music may share nomenclature but developed separately, such as [[Classical music era|classical music]] and [[classical ballet]].\n\n== Dance and rhythm ==\n'''[[Rhythm]] and dance''' are deeply linked in history and practice. The American dancer [[Ted Shawn]] wrote; \"The conception of rhythm which underlies all studies of the dance is something about which we could talk forever, and still not finish.\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\">Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p.50</ref> A musical rhythm requires two main elements; first, a regularly-repeating [[pulse (music)|pulse]] (also called the \"beat\" or \"tactus\") that establishes the [[tempo]] and, second, a pattern of [[Accent (music)|accents]] and [[Rest (music)|rests]] that establishes the character of the [[Meter (music)|metre or basic rhythmic pattern]]. The basic pulse is roughly equal in duration to a simple step or gesture. \n[[File:Tango rhythm.svg|thumb|A basic tango rhythm]]\nDances generally have a characteristic tempo and rhythmic pattern. The tango, for example, is usually danced in {{music|time|2|4}} time at approximately 66 beats per minute. The basic slow step, called a \"slow\", lasts for one beat, so that a full \"right\u2013left\" step is equal to one {{music|time|2|4}} measure. The basic forward and backward walk of the dance is so counted - \"slow-slow\" - while many additional figures are counted \"slow - quick-quick.<ref>Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing, ''Ballroom Dancing'', Teach Yourself Books, Hodder and Stoughton, 1977, p. 38</ref>\n\nJust as musical rhythms are defined by a pattern of strong and weak beats, so repetitive body movements often depends on alternating \"strong\" and \"weak\" muscular movements.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\">Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p.4</ref> Given this alternation of left-right, of forward-backward and rise-fall, along with the [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]] of the human body, it is natural that many dances and much music are in [[duple and quadruple meter]]. However, since some such movements require more time in one phase than the other - such as the longer time required to lift a hammer than to strike - some dance rhythms fall equally naturally into [[triple metre]].<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p.49</ref> Occasionally, as in [[Music of Southeastern Europe|the folk dances of the Balkans]], dance traditions depend heavily on more complex rhythms. Further, complex dances composed of a fixed sequence of steps always require phrases and melodies of a certain fixed length to accompany that sequence.\n\n[[File:Lululaund - The Dancing Girl (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|''Lululaund - The Dancing Girl'' (painting and silk cloth. A.L. Baldry 1901, before p.107), The inscription reads; \"Dancing is a form of rhythm/ Rhythm is a form of music/ Music is a form of thought/ And thought is a form of divinity.\"]]\nThe very act of dancing, the steps themselves, generate an \"initial skeleton of rhythmic beats\" that must have preceded any separate musical accompaniment, while dance itself, as much as music, requires time-keeping<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p.3</ref> just as utilitarian repetitive movements such as walking, hauling and digging take on, as they become refined, something of the quality of dance.<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/>\n\nMusical accompaniment therefore arose in the earliest dance, so that ancient Egyptians attributed the origin of the dance to the divine Athotus, who was said to have observed that music accompanying religious rituals caused participants to move rhythmically and to have brought these movements into proportional measure. The same idea, that dance arises from musical rhythm, is still found in [[renaissance]] Europe in the works of the dancing master [[Guglielmo Ebreo da Pesaro]] who speaks of dance as a physical movement that arises from and expresses inward, spiritual motion agreeing with the \"measures and perfect concords of harmony\" that fall upon the human ear,<ref name=\"Kirstein 4\"/> while, earlier, [[Mechthild of Magdeburg]], seizing upon dance as a symbol of the holy life foreshadowed in Jesus' saying \"I have piped and ye have not danced\",<ref>Matthew 11:17</ref> writes;\n\n{{quote|I can not dance unless thou leadest. If thou wouldst have me spring aloft, sing thou and I will spring, into love and from love to knowledge and from knowledge to ecstasy above all human sense<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p.108</ref>}}\n\n[[Thoinot Arbeau]]'s celebrated 16th century dance-treatise ''Orch\u00e9sographie'', indeed, begins with definitions of over eighty distinct drum-rhythms.<ref>Lincoln Kirstein, ''Dance'', Dance Horizons Incorporated, New York, 1969, p.157</ref>\n\n[[File:Dancing with Helen Moller; her own statement of her philosophy and practice and teaching formed upon the classic Greek model, and adapted to meet the aesthetic and hygienic needs of to-day, with (14784705065).jpg|thumb|right|Helen Moller]]\nAs has been shown above, dance has been represented through the ages as having emerged as a response to music yet, as [[Lincoln Kirstein]] implied, it is at least as likely that primitive music arose from dance. Shawn concurs, stating that dance \"was the first art of the human race, and the matrix out of which all other arts grew\" and that even the \"[[Meter (poetry)|metre]] in our poetry today is a result of the accents necessitated by body movement, as the dancing and reciting were performed simultaneously\"<ref name=\"Shawn 50\"/> - an assertion somewhat supported by the common use of the term \"foot\" to describe the fundamental rhythmic units of poetry.\n\n[[Percy Scholes|Scholes]], not a dancer but a musician, offers support for this view, stating that the steady measures of music, of two, three or four beats to the bar, its equal and balanced phrases, regular cadences, contrasts and repetitions, may all be attributed to the \"incalculable\" influence of dance upon music.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scholes |first=Percy A. |authorlink1= Percy Scholes |title= The Oxford Companion to Music |edition= 10 |year= 1977 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= |chapter=Dance |ref= CITEREFScholes1977}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze]], primarily a musician and teacher, relates how a study of the physical movements of pianists led him \"to the discovery that musical sensations of a rhythmic nature call for the muscular and nervous response of the whole organism\", to develop \"a special training designed to regulate nervous reactions and effect a co-ordination of muscles and nerves\" and ultimately to seek the connections between \"the art of music and the art of dance\", which he formulated into his system of [[Dalcroze Eurhythmics|eurhythmics]].<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p.viii</ref> He concluded that \"musical rhythm is only the transposition into sound of movements and dynamisms spontaneously and involuntarily expressing emotion\".<ref>\u00c9mile Jaques-Dalcroze, ''Rhythm, Music and Education'', 1973, The Dalcroze Society, London, p.181</ref>\n\nHence, though doubtless, as Shawn asserts, \"it is quite possible to develop the dance without music and... music is perfectly capable of standing on its own feet without any assistance from the dance\", nevertheless the \"two arts will always be related and the relationship can be profitable both to the dance and to music\",<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p.54</ref> the precedence of one art over the other being a moot point. The [[Common metre|common ballad measures]] of hymns and folk-songs takes their name from dance, as does the [[Carol (music)|carol]], originally a [[circle dance]]. Many purely musical pieces have been named \"[[waltz]]\" or \"[[minuet]]\", for example, while many [[concert dance]]s have been produced that are based upon abstract musical pieces, such as ''[[2 and 3 Part Inventions]], [[Adams Violin Concerto]]'' and ''[[Andantino (ballet)|Andantino]]''. Similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of \"measure\" or \"metre\" from poetry.\n\nShawn quotes with approval the statement of Dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents \"according to physiological law\", that of \"plastic rhythm\" (i.e. dance) \"is to designate movement in space, to interpret long time-values by slow movements and short ones by quick movements, regulate pauses by their divers successions and express sound accentuations in their multiple nuances by additions of bodily weight, by means of muscular innervations\".\n\nShawn nevertheless points out that the system of musical time is a \"man-made, artificial thing.... a manufactured tool, whereas rhythm is something that has always existed and depends on man not at all\", being \"the continuous flowing time which our human minds cut up into convenient units\", suggesting that music might be revivified by a return to the values and the time-perception of dancing.<ref>Shawn, Ted, ''Dance We Must'', 1946, Dennis Dobson Ltd., London, p.50-51</ref>\n\nThe early-20th-century American dancer Helen Moller stated simply that \"it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.\"<ref>Moller, Helen and Dunham, Curtis, ''Dancing with Helen Moller'', 1918, John Lane (New York and London), p.74</ref>\n\n==Approaches to dance==\n\n===Concert dance===\nConcert dance, like [[opera]], generally depends for its large-scale form upon a [[narrative]] [[dramatic structure]]. The movements and gestures of the [[choreography]] are primarily intended to [[mime]] the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot.<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 2</ref> Such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. On the other hand, the ''[[ballet blanc]]'', developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely \"plotless\" ballets in the 20th century<ref>Minden, Eliza Gaynor, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=S-RuSzcrBnAC&dq=%22ballet+blanc%22&source=gbs_navlinks_s ''The Ballet Companion: A Dancer's Guide''], Simon and Schuster, 2007, p.92</ref> and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the ''petit allegro''. A well-known example is ''[[Danse des petits cygnes|The Cygnets' Dance]]'' in act two of ''[[Swan Lake]]''.\n\nThe [[ballet]] developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century France and Italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite,<ref>Thoinot Arbeau, ''Orchesography'', trans. by Mary Stewart Evans, with notes by Julia Sutton, New York: Dover, 1967</ref> all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. These appeared as [[character dance]]s in the era of [[romantic nationalism]].\n\nBallet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. A broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which [[Rudolf Laban]] terms the \"rhythm and shape\" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention,<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, pp. 2,4 ''et passim''</ref> while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to Laban, modern Europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of \"primitive rhythmic movements\",<ref>Laban, Rudolf, ''The Mastery of Movement'', MacDonald and Evans, London, 1960, p. 86</ref> a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.<ref>Abigail Wagner, [https://www.lawrence.edu/mfhe/www_web_student/Everyone/A%20Different%20Type%20of%20Rhythm.pdf ''A Different Type of Rhythm''], Lawrence University, Wisconsin</ref>\n\nIndian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and \"pure\" dance. In this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. The rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as ''nritta''. Both this and expressive dance ''(nritya)'', though, are closely tied to the rhythmic system (''[[Tala (music)|tala]]''). Teachers have adapted the spoken rhythmic mnemonic system called ''[[Bol (music)|bol]]'' to the needs of dancers.\n\nJapanese classical dance-theatre styles such as [[Kabuki]] and [[Noh]], like Indian dance-drama, distinguish between narrative and abstract dance productions. The three main categories of kabuki are ''[[jidaimono]]'' (historical), ''[[sewamono]]'' (domestic) and ''[[shosagoto]]'' (dance pieces).<ref name=\"Kabuki MIT Global Shakespeares\">{{cite web | url=http://globalshakespeares.mit.edu/glossary/kabuki/ | title=Kabuki \u00ab MIT Global Shakespeares | accessdate=April 8, 2015}}</ref> Somewhat similarly, Noh distinguishes between ''Geki Noh'', based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and ''Fury\u016b Noh'', dance pieces involving acrobatics, stage properties, multiple characters and elaborate stage action.<ref name=\"Ortolani\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ge8cWl8OT3gC&pg=PA132&dq=mugen-no+Genzai-no+waki-no#v=onepage&q=mugen-no%20Genzai-no%20waki-no&f=false |page=132 |title=The Japanese theatre: from shamanistic ritual to contemporary pluralism |first=Benito |last=Ortolani| publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1995 |isbn=0-691-04333-7}}</ref>\n\n===Participatory and social dance===\n[[Social dances]], those intended for participation rather than for an audience, may include various forms of mime and narrative, but are typically set much more closely to the rhythmic pattern of music, so that terms like [[waltz]] and [[polka]] refer as much to musical pieces as to the dance itself. The rhythm of the dancers' feet may even form an essential part of the music, as in [[tap dance]]. African dance, for example, is rooted in fixed basic steps, but may also allow a high degree of rhythmic interpretation: the feet or the trunk mark the basic pulse while cross-rhythms are picked up by shoulders, knees, or head, with the best dancers simultaneously giving plastic expression to all the elements of the [[polyrhythm]]ic pattern.<ref>Ayansu, E.

Indian classical music provides accompaniment and dancers of nearly all the styles wear bells around their ankles to counterpoint and complement the percussion.\n\nThere are now many regional varieties of [[Indian classical dance]]. Dances like ''\"Odra Magadhi\"'', which after decades long debate, has been traced to present day Mithila, [[Odisha]] region's dance form of [[Odissi]] (Orissi), indicate influence of dances in cultural interactions between different regions.<ref>[http://www.exoticindiaart.com/article/dance Exoticindiaart.com], Dance: The Living Spirit of Indian Arts, by Prof. P. C. Jain and Dr. Daljeet.</ref>\n\nThe [[Punjab region|Punjab]] area overlapping India and [[Pakistan]] is the place of origin of [[Bhangra (dance)|Bhangra]]. It is widely known both as a style of music and a dance. It is mostly related to ancient harvest celebrations, love, patriotism or social issues. Its music is coordinated by a musical instrument called the 'Dhol'. Bhangra is not just music but a dance, a celebration of the harvest where people beat the dhol (drum), sing Boliyaan (lyrics) and dance. It developed further with the Vaisakhi festival of the [[Sikh]]s.\n\nThe [[dances of Sri Lanka]] include the devil dances (''yakun natima''), a carefully crafted ritual reaching far back into Sri Lanka's pre-Buddhist past that combines ancient \"[[Ayurvedic]]\" concepts of disease causation with [[psychological manipulation]] and combines many aspects including Sinhalese cosmology.

Some European folk dances such as the [[square dance]] were brought to the [[New World]] and subsequently became part of American culture.\n\n[[Ballet]] developed first in Italy and then in France from lavish court spectacles that combined music, drama, poetry, song, costumes and dance. Members of the court nobility took part as performers. During the reign of [[Louis XIV]], himself a dancer, dance became more codified. Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs, and ballet masters were licensed by the French government. The first ballet dance academy was the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse (Royal Dance Academy), opened in Paris in 1661. Shortly thereafter, the first institutionalized ballet troupe, associated with the Academy, was formed; this troupe began as an all-male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well.<ref name=\"lecomte\"/>\n\n[[20th century concert dance]] brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. Early pioneers of what became known as [[modern dance]] include [[Loie Fuller]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Mary Wigman]] and [[Ruth St. Denis]]. The relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for [[Eurhythmics]], devised by [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]], which was influential to the development of Modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as [[Marie Rambert]]. [[Eurythmy]], developed by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]], combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. In the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as [[Martha Graham]] and [[Doris Humphrey]] began their work. Since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see [[Modern dance]].\n\n[[File:HK TST night \u67cf\u9e97\u8cfc\u7269\u5927\u9053 Park Lane Shopper's Boulevard \u5df4\u897f Brasil \u68ee\u5df4\u821e\u5a18 Samba female dancers Nov-2010 02.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.1| [[samba school|Street samba]] dancers perform in carnival parades and contests]]\n[[African American dance]] developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies.

The professional life of a dancer is generally one of constantly changing work situations, strong competitive pressure and low pay. Consequently, professional dancers often must supplement their incomes to achieve financial stability. In the U.S. many professional dancers belong to unions (such as the [[American Guild of Musical Artists]], [[Screen Actors Guild]] and [[Actors' Equity Association]]) that establish working conditions and minimum salaries for their members. Professional dancers must possess large amounts of athleticism. To lead a successful career, it is advantageous to be versatile in many styles of dance, have a strong technical background and to utilize other forms of physical training to remain fit and healthy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sagolla|first=Lisa|date=April 24, 2008|title=Untitled|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=fa35d8ae-239b-4764-b82f-f58a07a15475%40sessionmgr4006&vid=11&hid=4104&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=32038206&db=ibh|journal=International Bibliography of Theatre & Dance with Full Text|volume= 15| issue = 17 |page=1}}</ref>\n\n===Dance teachers===\nDance teachers typically focus on teaching dance performance, or coaching competitive dancers, or both. They typically have performance experience in the types of dance they teach or coach. For example, [[dancesport]] teachers and coaches are often tournament dancers or former dancesport performers. Dance teachers may be self-employed, or employed by [[dance school]]s or general education institutions with dance programs. Some work for university programs or other schools that are associated with professional classical dance (e.g., ballet) or modern dance companies. Others are employed by smaller, privately owned dance schools that offer dance training and performance coaching for various types of dance.\n\n===Choreographers===\n[[Choreography (dance)|Choreographers]] are often university trained and are typically employed for particular projects or, more rarely may work on contract as the resident choreographer for a specific dance company.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:MIT 2006 Standard Prechamp Final 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.45|An amateur dancesport competition, featuring the [[Viennese Waltz]]]]\n\nA '''dance competition''' is an organized event in which contestants perform dances before a judge or judges for awards, and in some cases, monetary prizes.
