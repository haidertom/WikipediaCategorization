Following the [[octet rule]] for both carbon and oxygen, the two atoms form a [[triple bond]], with six shared electrons in three bonding molecular orbitals, rather than the usual double bond found in organic carbonyl compounds. Since four of the shared electrons come from the oxygen atom and only two from carbon, one bonding orbital is occupied by two electrons from oxygen, forming a dative or [[dipolar bond]]. This causes a C\u2190O [[Chemical polarity|polarization]] of the molecule, with a small negative charge on carbon and a small positive charge on oxygen. The other two bonding orbitals are each occupied by one electron from carbon and one from oxygen, forming (polar) covalent bonds with a reverse C\u2192O polarization, since oxygen is more [[electronegativity|electronegative]] than carbon.

Two regions are called ''adjacent'' if they share a common boundary that is not a corner, where corners are the points shared by three or more regions.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Formal Proof\u2014The Four-Color Theorem |author=Georges Gonthier |journal=Notices of the AMS |volume=55 |issue=11 |date=December 2008 |pages=1382\u20131393}}From this paper: Definitions: A planar map is a set of pairwise disjoint subsets of the plane, called regions. A simple map is one whose regions are connected open sets. Two regions of a map are adjacent if their respective closures have a common point that is not a corner of the map. A point is a corner of a map if and only if it belongs to the closures of at least three regions. Theorem: The regions of any simple planar map can be colored with only four colors, in such a way that any two adjacent regions have different colors.</ref> For example, in the map of the United States of America, Utah and Arizona are adjacent, but Utah and New Mexico, which only share a [[Four Corners Monument|point]] that also belongs to Arizona and Colorado, are not.\n\n[[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]] mentioned the problem in his lectures as early as 1840.<ref name=\"rouse_ball_1960\">[[W. W. Rouse Ball]] (1960) ''The Four Color Theorem'', in Mathematical Recreations and Essays, Macmillan, New York, pp 222-232.</ref> The conjecture was first proposed on October 23, 1852<ref name=MacKenzie>Donald MacKenzie, ''Mechanizing Proof: Computing, Risk, and Trust'' (MIT Press, 2004) p103</ref> when [[Francis Guthrie]], while trying to color the map of counties of England, noticed that only four different colors were needed. The [[five color theorem]], which has a short elementary proof, states that five colors suffice to color a map and was proven in the late 19th century {{Harv|Heawood|1890}}; however, proving that four colors suffice turned out to be significantly harder. A number of false proofs and false [[counterexample]]s have appeared since the first statement of the four color theorem in 1852.\n\nThe four color theorem was proven in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]]. It was the first major [[theorem]] to be [[computer-assisted proof#List of theorems proved with the help of computer programs|proved using a computer]]. Appel and Haken's approach started by showing that there is a particular set of 1,936 maps, each of which cannot be part of a smallest-sized counterexample to the four color theorem. (If they did appear, you could make a smaller counter-example.) Appel and Haken used a special-purpose computer program to confirm that each of these maps had this property. Additionally, any map that could potentially be a counterexample must have a portion that looks like one of these 1,936 maps. Showing this required hundreds of pages of hand analysis, Appel and Haken concluded that no smallest counterexamples exists because any must contain, yet do not contain, one of these 1,936 maps. This contradiction means there are no counterexamples at all and that the theorem is therefore true. Initially, their proof was not accepted by all mathematicians because the [[computer-assisted proof]] was infeasible for a human to check by hand {{Harv|Swart|1980}}. Since then the proof has gained wider acceptance, although doubts remain {{Harv|Wilson|2002|loc=216\u2013222}}.\n\n===Hauptvermutung===\n{{main|Hauptvermutung}}\n\nThe [[Hauptvermutung]] (German for main conjecture) of [[geometric topology]] is the conjecture that any two [[Triangulation (topology)|triangulations]] of a [[triangulable space]] have a common refinement, a single triangulation that is a subdivision of both of them. It was originally formulated in 1908, by [[Ernst Steinitz|Steinitz]] and [[Heinrich Franz Friedrich Tietze|Tietze]].\n\nThis conjecture is now known to be false. The non-manifold version was disproved by [[John Milnor]]<ref>{{Cite journal|first=John W.|last= Milnor |title=Two complexes which are homeomorphic but combinatorially distinct|journal= [[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=74|year=1961|issue= 2 |pages=575&ndash;590|mr=133127|doi=10.2307/1970299|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

The generating function has coefficients derived from the numbers ''N''<sub>''k''</sub> of points over the (essentially unique) field with ''q''<sup>''k''</sup> elements.\n\nWeil conjectured that such ''zeta-functions'' should be [[rational function]]s, should satisfy a form of [[functional equation]], and should have their zeroes in restricted places. The last two parts were quite consciously modeled on the [[Riemann zeta function]] and [[Riemann hypothesis]]. The rationality was proved by {{harvtxt|Dwork|1960}}, the functional equation by {{harvtxt|Grothendieck|1965}}, and the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was  proved by {{harvtxt|Deligne|1974}}\n\n===Poincar\u00e9 conjecture===\n{{main|Poincar\u00e9 conjecture}}\nIn [[mathematics]], the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]] is a [[theorem]] about the [[Characterization (mathematics)|characterization]] of the [[3-sphere]], which is the hypersphere that bounds the [[unit ball]] in four-dimensional space. The conjecture states: {{quote|Every [[simply connected]], [[closed manifold|closed]] 3-[[manifold]] is [[homeomorphic]] to the 3-sphere.}} An equivalent form of the conjecture involves a coarser form of equivalence than homeomorphism called [[homotopy equivalence]]: if a 3-manifold is ''homotopy equivalent'' to the 3-sphere, then it is necessarily ''homeomorphic'' to it.\n\nOriginally conjectured by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], the theorem concerns a space that locally looks like ordinary three-dimensional space but is connected, finite in size, and lacks any boundary (a [[Closed manifold|closed]] [[3-manifold]]).  The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture claims that if such a space has the additional property that each [[path (topology)|loop]] in the space can be continuously tightened to a point, then it is necessarily a three-dimensional sphere.  An [[generalized Poincar\u00e9 conjecture|analogous result]] has been known in higher dimensions for some time.\n\nAfter nearly a century of effort by mathematicians, [[Grigori Perelman]] presented a proof of the conjecture in three papers made available in 2002 and 2003 on [[arXiv]]. The proof followed on from the program of [[Richard S. Hamilton]] to use the [[Ricci flow]] to attempt to solve the problem. Hamilton later introduced a modification of the standard Ricci flow, called ''Ricci flow with surgery'' to systematically excise singular regions as they develop, in a controlled way, but was unable to prove this method \"converged\" in three dimensions.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Richard S. | authorlink = Richard S.

The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the [[Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields]].\n\nThe Riemann hypothesis implies results about the distribution of [[prime numbers]]. Along with suitable generalizations, some mathematicians consider it the most important unresolved problem in [[pure mathematics]] {{harv|Bombieri|2000}}. The Riemann hypothesis, along with the [[Goldbach conjecture]], is part of [[Hilbert's eighth problem]] in [[David Hilbert]]'s list of [[Hilbert's problems|23 unsolved problems]]; it is also one of the [[Clay Mathematics Institute]] [[Millennium Prize Problems]].\n\n===P versus NP problem===\n{{main|P versus NP problem}}\nThe [[P versus NP problem]] is a major [[List of unsolved problems in computer science|unsolved problem in computer science]].  Informally, it asks whether every  problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be quickly solved by a computer; it is widely conjectured that the answer is no.

It has not been proven which one is false, but it is widely believed that the first conjecture is true and the second one is false.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Ian | last=Richards | title=On the Incompatibility of Two Conjectures Concerning Primes | journal=Bull.

In mathematics, any number of cases supporting a conjecture, no matter how large, is insufficient for establishing the conjecture's veracity, since a single [[counterexample]] would immediately bring down the conjecture. Mathematical journals sometimes publish the minor results of research teams having extended the search for a counterexample farther than previously done.  For instance, the [[Collatz conjecture]], which concerns whether or not certain [[sequence]]s of [[integer]]s terminate, has been tested for all integers up to 1.2 &times; 10<sup>12</sup> (over a trillion). However, the failure to find a counterexample after extensive search does not constitute a proof that no counterexample exists nor that the conjecture is true, because the conjecture might be false but with a very large minimal counterexample.\n\nInstead, a conjecture is considered proven only when it has been shown that it is logically impossible for it to be false. There are various methods of doing so; see [[Mathematical proof#Methods]] for details.\n\nOne method of proof, usable when there are only a finite number of cases that could lead to counterexamples, is known as \"brute force\": in this approach, all possible cases are considered and shown not to give counterexamples. Sometimes the number of cases is quite large, in which situation a brute-force proof may require as a practical matter the use of a computer algorithm to check all the cases: the validity of the 1976 and 1997 brute-force proofs of the [[four color theorem]] by computer was initially doubted, but was eventually confirmed in 2005 by [[theorem-proving]] software.\n\nWhen a conjecture has been [[mathematical proof|proven]], it is no longer a conjecture but a [[theorem]]. Many important theorems were once conjectures, such as the [[Geometrization conjecture|Geometrization theorem]] (which resolved the [[Poincar\u00e9 conjecture]]), [[Fermat's Last Theorem]], and others.\n\n===Disproof===\nConjectures disproven through counterexample are sometimes referred to as ''false conjectures'' (cf. the [[P\u00f3lya conjecture]] and [[Euler's sum of powers conjecture]]). In the case of the latter, the first counterexample found for the n=4 case involved numbers in the millions, although subsequently it has been found that the minimal counterexample is smaller than that.\n\n===Undecidable conjectures===\nNot every conjecture ends up being proven true or false. The [[continuum hypothesis]], which tries to ascertain the relative [[cardinal number|cardinality]] of certain [[infinite set]]s, was eventually shown to be [[Independence (mathematical logic)|undecidable]] (or independent) from the generally accepted set of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel axioms|axioms of set theory]]. It is therefore possible to adopt this statement, or its negation, as a new [[axiom]] in a consistent manner (much as we can take [[Euclid]]'s [[parallel postulate]] as either true or false).\n\nIn this case, if a proof uses this statement, researchers will often look for a new proof that ''doesn't'' require the hypothesis (in the same way that it is desirable that statements in [[Euclidean geometry]] be proved using only the axioms of neutral geometry, i.e. no parallel postulate.) The one major exception to this in practice is the [[axiom of choice]]\u2014unless studying this axiom in particular, the majority of researchers do not usually worry whether a result requires the axiom of choice.\n\n==Conditional proofs==\nSometimes a conjecture is called a ''hypothesis'' when it is used frequently and repeatedly as an assumption in proofs of other results. For example, the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is a conjecture from [[number theory]] that (amongst other things) makes predictions about the distribution of [[prime number]]s. Few number theorists doubt that the Riemann hypothesis is true. In anticipation of its eventual proof, some have proceeded to develop further proofs which are contingent on the truth of this conjecture. These are called ''[[conditional proof]]s'': the conjectures assumed appear in the hypotheses of the theorem, for the time being.\n\nThese \"proofs\", however, would fall apart if it turned out that the hypothesis was false, so there is considerable interest in verifying the truth or falsity of conjectures of this type.\n\n==In other sciences==\n[[Karl Popper]] pioneered the use of the term \"conjecture\" in [[Philosophy of science|scientific philosophy]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Popper|first=Karl|title=Conjectures and refutations : the growth of scientific knowledge|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-28594-1}}</ref> Conjecture is related to [[hypothesis]], which in [[science]] refers to a testable conjecture.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bold hypothesis]]\n* [[Hypotheticals]]\n* [[List of conjectures]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wiktionary|conjecture}}\n* [http://garden.irmacs.sfu.ca/ Open Problem Garden]\n* [http://unsolvedproblems.org/ Unsolved Problems web site]\n\n{{Portal bar|Mathematics|Science}}\n\n[[Category:Conjectures| ]]\n[[Category:Statements]]\n[[Category:Concepts in the philosophy of science]]", "sha1": "ketov5j3yv1ipsiobjll0v1gc0n8q4u"}}, {"title": "Christoph Ludwig Agricola", "ns": "0", "id": "6139", "revision": {"id": "859301634", "parentid": "859301200", "timestamp": "2018-09-13T04:22:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "Johnbod", "id": "2563820"}, "comment": "removed [[Category:Orientalist painters]] using [[WP:HC|HotCat]] not NEARLY enough!", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox artist\n| name             = Christoph Ludwig Agricola\n| honorific_suffix = \n| image            = File:Christoph Ludwig Agricola.jpg|\n| image_size       = 200px\n| alt              = \n| caption          = Christoph Ludwig Agricola\n| native_name      = \n| native_name_lang = \n| birth_name       = \n| birth_date       = 5 November, 1667 \n| birth_place      = Regensburg, Germany\n| death_date       = 8 August, 1719\n| death_place      = Regensburg, Germany\n| resting_place    = \n| resting_place_coordinates = <!-- {{Coord|LAT|LONG|type:landmark|display=inline}} -->\n| nationality      = German\n| residence        = \n| education        = Germany\n| alma_mater       = \n| known_for        = Painting, etching\n| notable_works    = \n| style            = \n| movement         = \n| spouse           = \n| partner          = \n| awards           = \n| elected          = \n| patrons          = \n| memorials        = \n| website          = \n| module           = \n}}\n\n'''Christoph Ludwig Agricola''' (November 5, 1667 \u2013 August 8, 1719) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Landscape art|landscape painter]] and etcher.

A member of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], he was the son of [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor]]. He was born at [[Lugdunum]] in [[Gaul]], the first (and until [[Trajan]], only) Roman Emperor to be born outside [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Italy]]. Because he was afflicted with a limp and slight deafness due to sickness at a young age, his family ostracized him and excluded him from public office until his [[Roman consul|consulship]], shared with his nephew [[Caligula]] in 37.\n\nClaudius' infirmity probably saved him from the fate of many other nobles during the purges of [[Tiberius]]'s and Caligula's reigns; potential enemies did not see him as a serious threat. His survival led to his being declared Emperor by the [[Praetorian Guard]] after Caligula's assassination, at which point he was the last man of his family. Despite his lack of experience, Claudius proved to be an able and efficient administrator. He was also an ambitious builder, constructing many new roads, aqueducts, and canals across the Empire. During his reign the Empire began the [[Roman conquest of Britain|conquest of Britain]] (if the earlier [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invasions of Britain by Caesar]] and Caligula's aborted attempts are not counted). Having a personal interest in law, he presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day. He was seen as vulnerable throughout his reign, particularly by elements of the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position; this resulted in the deaths of many [[Roman Senate|senators]]. These events damaged his reputation among the  ancient writers, though more recent historians have revised this opinion. Many authors contend that he was murdered by his own wife.  After his death in 54 AD (at the age of 63), his grand-nephew, step-son, and adopted son [[Nero]] succeeded him as Emperor. His 13-year reign (slightly longer than Nero's) would not be surpassed by any successors until that of [[Domitian]], who reigned for 15 years. \n\nHe was a descendant of the [[Octavii Rufi]] (through [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|Gaius Octavius]]), [[Julii Caesares]] (through [[Julia Minor (sister of Caesar)|Julia Minor]] and [[Julia Antonia]]), and the [[Claudii Nerones]] (through [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]). He was a step-grandson (through his father Drusus) and great-nephew (through his mother [[Antonia Minor]]) of [[Augustus]]. He was a nephew of Tiberius through his father, Tiberius' brother. Through his brother [[Germanicus]], Claudius was an uncle of Caligula and a great-uncle of Nero.\n\n==Family and early life==\n{{Julio-Claudian dynasty}}\nClaudius was born on 1 August 10 BC at [[Lugdunum]] (modern [[Lyon, France|Lyon]], France). He had two older siblings, [[Germanicus]] and [[Livilla]]. His mother, Antonia, may have had two other children who died young.\n\nHis maternal grandparents were [[Mark Antony]] and [[Octavia Minor]], [[Augustus]]' sister, and he was therefore the great-great grandnephew of [[Julius Caesar|Gaius Julius Caesar]]. His paternal grandparents were [[Livia]], Augustus' third wife, and [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]]. During his reign, Claudius revived the rumor that his father Drusus was actually the illegitimate son of Augustus, to give the appearance that Augustus was Claudius' paternal grandfather.\n\nIn 9 BC, his father Drusus unexpectedly died on campaign in Germania, possibly from illness. Claudius was then left to be raised by his mother, who never remarried. When Claudius' disability became evident, the relationship with his family turned sour. Antonia referred to him as a monster, and used him as a standard for stupidity. She seems to have passed her son off to his grandmother [[Livia]] for a number of years.<ref>Dio ''Hist.'' LX 2</ref>\n\nLivia was a little kinder, but nevertheless often sent him short, angry letters of reproof. He was put under the care of a \"former mule-driver\"<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 2. Suet ''Claud.'' 4 indicates the reasons for choosing this tutor, as outlined in Leon (1948).</ref> to keep him disciplined, under the logic that his condition was due to laziness and a lack of will-power. However, by the time he reached his teenage years his symptoms apparently waned and his family took some notice of his scholarly interests.<ref name=\"Suet4\">Suet. ''Claud.'' 4.</ref>\n\nIn 7 AD, [[Livy]] was hired to tutor him in history, with the assistance of Sulpicius Flavus. He spent a lot of his time with the latter and the philosopher [[Athenodoros Cananites|Athenodorus]]. Augustus, according to a letter, was surprised at the clarity of Claudius' oratory.<ref name=\"Suet4\"/> Expectations about his future began to increase.\n\n===Public life===\nHis work as a budding historian damaged his prospects for advancement in public life. According to Vincent Scramuzza and others, Claudius began work on a history of the [[Roman civil wars|Civil Wars]] that was either too truthful or too critical of [[Octavian]]<ref>Scramuzza (1940) p.&nbsp;39.</ref>\u2014then reigning as [[Augustus Caesar]]. In either case, it was far too early for such an account, and may have only served to remind Augustus that Claudius was Antony's descendant. His mother and grandmother quickly put a stop to it, and this may have convinced them that Claudius was not fit for public office. He could not be trusted to toe the existing [[Party line (politics)|party line]].<ref name=\"Stuart\">Stuart (1936).</ref>\n\nWhen he returned to the narrative later in life, Claudius skipped over the wars of the [[Second Triumvirate|second triumvirate]] altogether. But the damage was done, and his family pushed him into the background. When the [[Triumphal arch|Arch]] of [[Pavia]] was erected to honor the Imperial clan in 8 BC, Claudius' name (now Tiberius Claudius Nero Germanicus after his elevation to [[paterfamilias]] of Claudii Nerones on the adoption of his brother) was inscribed on the edge\u2014past the deceased princes, [[Gaius Caesar|Gaius]] and [[Lucius Caesar|Lucius]], and Germanicus' children. There is some speculation that the inscription was added by Claudius himself decades later, and that he originally did not appear at all.<ref name=\"Stuart\"/>\n\nWhen Augustus died in 14 AD, Claudius\u2014then 23\u2014appealed to his uncle [[Tiberius]] to allow him to begin the ''[[cursus honorum]]''. Tiberius, the new Emperor, responded by granting Claudius consular ornaments. Claudius requested office once more and was snubbed. Since the new Emperor was no more generous than the old, Claudius gave up hope of public office and retired to a scholarly, private life.\n\nDespite the disdain of the Imperial family, it seems that from very early on the general public respected Claudius. At Augustus' death, the ''[[Equestrian (Roman)|equites]]'', or knights, chose Claudius to head their delegation. When his house burned down, the Senate demanded it be rebuilt at public expense. They also requested that Claudius be allowed to debate in the Senate. Tiberius turned down both motions, but the sentiment remained.\n\nDuring the period immediately after the death of Tiberius' son, [[Julius Caesar Drusus|Drusus]], Claudius was pushed by some quarters as a potential heir. This again suggests the political nature of his exclusion from public life. However, as this was also the period during which the power and terror of the commander of the [[Praetorian Guard]], [[Sejanus]], was at its peak, Claudius chose to downplay this possibility.\n\nAfter the death of Tiberius, the new emperor [[Caligula]] (the son of Claudius' brother [[Germanicus]]) recognized Claudius to be of some use. He appointed Claudius his co-consul in 37 in order to emphasize the memory of Caligula's deceased father Germanicus. Despite this, Caligula relentlessly tormented his uncle: playing practical jokes, charging him enormous sums of money, humiliating him before the Senate, and the like. According to [[Cassius Dio]] Claudius became very sickly and thin by the end of Caligula's reign, most likely due to [[Psychological stress|stress]].<ref>Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 2. Suhr (1955) suggests that this must refer to before Claudius came to power.</ref> A possible surviving portrait of Claudius from this period may support this.\n\n===Assassination of Caligula (41 AD)===\n[[File:Herold of Chalcis coin showing Herod of Chalcis with brother Agrippa of Judaea crowning Roman Emperor Claudius I.jpg|thumb|A coin of [[Herod of Chalcis]], showing him with his brother [[Herod Agrippa I|Agrippa of Judaea]] crowning Claudius. [[British Museum]].]]\n\nOn 24 January 41, Caligula was assassinated in a broad-based [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] involving the Praetorian commander [[Cassius Chaerea]] and several [[Roman Senate|senators]]. There is no evidence that Claudius had a direct hand in the [[assassination]], although it has been argued that he knew about the plot\u2014particularly since he left the scene of the crime shortly before his nephew was murdered.<ref>Major (1992)</ref> However, after the deaths of [[Milonia Caesonia|Caligula's wife]] and [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|daughter]], it became apparent that Cassius intended to go beyond the terms of the conspiracy and wipe out the Imperial family.<ref name=\"Josephus\">Josephus ''Antiquitates Iudiacae'' XIX.

He fled to the palace to hide. According to tradition, a Praetorian named [[Gratus]] found him hiding behind a curtain and suddenly declared him ''[[princeps]]''.<ref name=\"Josephus\"/> A section of the guard may have planned in advance to seek out Claudius, perhaps with his approval. They reassured him that they were not one of the battalions looking for revenge. He was spirited away to the [[Castra Praetoria|Praetorian camp]] and put under their protection.\n\nThe Senate quickly met and began debating a change of government, but this eventually devolved into an argument over which of them would be the new ''princeps''. When they heard of the Praetorians' claim, they demanded that Claudius be delivered to them for approval, but he refused, sensing the danger that would come with complying. Some historians, particularly [[Josephus]],<ref>Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX.</ref> claim that Claudius was directed in his actions by the [[Iudaea Province|Judaean]] King [[Herod Agrippa]]. However, an earlier version of events by the same ancient author downplays Agrippa's role<ref>Josephus ''Bellum Iudiacum'' II, 204\u2013233.</ref> so it remains uncertain. Eventually the Senate was forced to give in and, in return, Claudius pardoned nearly all the assassins.\n\n==As Emperor==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2015}}\n[[Image:Aureus of emperor Claudius.jpg|thumb|''[[Aureus]]'' of Claudius, struck at the [[Lugdunum]] (Lyon) mint, dated 41\u201342.

The depiction of the goddess [[Pax-Nemesis]], representing subdued vengeance, would be used on the coins of many later emperors.]]\nClaudius took several steps to legitimize his rule against potential usurpers, most of them emphasizing his place within the Julio-Claudian family. He adopted the name \"Caesar\" as a [[cognomen]], as the name still carried great weight with the populace. In order to do so, he dropped the cognomen \"Nero\" which he had adopted as ''paterfamilias'' of the Claudii Nerones when his brother Germanicus was adopted out.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} As Pharaoh of Egypt, Claudius adopted the royal titulary ''Tiberios Klaudios, Autokrator Heqaheqau Meryasetptah, Kanakht Djediakhshuemakhet'' (\"Tiberius Claudius, Emperor and ruler of rulers, beloved of Isis and Ptah, the strong bull of the stable moon on the horizon\").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pharaoh.se/roman-emperor/Claudius |title=Claudius |access-date=March 12, 2018 |website=The Royal Titulary of Ancient Egypt}}</ref>\n\nWhile Claudius had never been formally adopted either by Augustus or his successors, he was nevertheless the grandson of Augustus' sister Octavia, and so he felt that he had the right of family. He also adopted the name \"Augustus\" as the two previous emperors had done at their accessions. He kept the honorific \"Germanicus\" to display the connection with his heroic brother. He deified his paternal grandmother Livia to highlight her position as wife of the divine Augustus. Claudius frequently used the term \"filius Drusi\" (son of Drusus) in his titles, in order to remind the people of his legendary father and lay claim to his reputation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSince Claudius was the first Emperor proclaimed on the initiative of the Praetorian Guard instead of the Senate, his repute suffered at the hands of commentators (such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]). Moreover, he was the first Emperor who resorted to bribery as a means to secure army loyalty and rewarded the soldiers of the Praetorian Guard that had elevated him with 15,000 sesterces.<ref>Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 10</ref> Tiberius and Augustus had both left gifts to the army and guard in their [[will (law)|wills]], and upon Caligula's death the same would have been expected, even if no will existed. Claudius remained grateful to the guard, however, issuing coins with tributes to the Praetorians in the early part of his reign.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coin, Museum No. R1874,0715.4|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1216117&partId=1|website=British Museum Online Collection|accessdate=26 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Pliny the Elder]] noted, according to the 1938 [[Loeb Classical Library]] translation by Harris Rackham, \"...&nbsp;many people do not allow any gems in a signet-ring, and seal with the gold itself; this was a fashion invented when Claudius C\u00e6sar was emperor.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loebclassics.com/view/pliny_elder-natural_history/1938/pb_LCL394.21.xml|title=Pliny The Elder, Natural History|author=Harris Rackham|publisher=Loeb Classical Library|year=1938}}</ref>\n\nClaudius restored the status of the peaceful Imperial Roman provinces of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea]] as [[senatorial provinces]].<ref>A History of the Roman People; 1984, Fritz Heichelheim, Cedric Veo, Allen Ward, Prentice Hall Inc., Englewoods, N.J.</ref>\n\n===Expansion of the Empire===\nUnder Claudius, the Empire underwent its first major expansion since the reign of Augustus. The provinces of [[Thrace]], [[Noricum]], [[Pamphylia]], [[Lycia]], and [[Judea]] were [[annexation|annexed]] (or put under direct rule) under various circumstances during his term. The annexation of [[Mauretania]], begun under Caligula, was completed after the defeat of rebel forces, and the official division of the former client kingdom into two Imperial provinces.<ref>Pliny 5.1\u20135.2, Cassius Dio, 60.8, 60.9</ref> The most far-reaching conquest was [[Roman conquest of Britain|that of Britannia]]''.<ref>Scramuzza, Chap. 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Roman emperor head.jpg|thumb|250px|Bronze head of Claudius found in the [[River Alde]] at [[Rendham]], near [[Saxmundham]], Suffolk ([[British Museum]]).

Britain was an attractive target for Rome because of its material wealth&nbsp;\u2013 particularly mines and slaves. It was also a haven for [[Gaul|Gallic]] rebels and the like, and so could not be left alone much longer. Claudius himself traveled to the island after the completion of initial offensives, bringing with him reinforcements and elephants. The latter must have made an impression on the [[British people|Britons]] when they were displayed in the large tribal centre of [[Camulodunum]], modern day [[Colchester]]. The Roman ''[[Colonia (Roman)|colonia]]'' of ''Colonia Claudia Victricensis'' was established as the provincial capital of the newly established [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]] at Camulodunum,<ref name=\"Crummy 97\">Crummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Colchester - Britain's first Roman town. Published by Colchester Archaeological Trust ({{ISBN|1 897719 04 3}})</ref> where a large [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|Temple was dedicated in his honour]].<ref name=\"Crummy 97\"/>\n\nHe left after 16 days, but remained in the provinces for some time. The Senate granted him a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for his efforts. Only members of the Imperial family were allowed such honours, but Claudius subsequently lifted this restriction for some of his conquering generals. He was granted the honorific \"Britannicus\" but only accepted it on behalf of his son, never using the title himself. When the Briton general [[Caractacus]] was captured in 50 AD, Claudius granted him clemency. Caractacus lived out his days on land provided by the Roman state, an unusual end for an enemy commander.\n\nClaudius conducted a census in 48 that found 5,984,072 Roman citizens<ref>Scramuzza, Chap. 7, p. 142</ref> (adult males with [[Roman citizenship]]; women, children, slaves, and free adult males without Roman citizenship were not counted), an increase of around a million since the census conducted at Augustus' death. He had helped increase this number through the foundation of Roman colonies that were granted blanket [[Roman citizenship|citizenship]]. These colonies were often made out of existing communities, especially those with elites who could rally the populace to the Roman cause. Several colonies were placed in new provinces or on the border of the Empire to secure Roman holdings as quickly as possible.\n\n===Judicial and legislative affairs===\nClaudius personally judged many of the legal cases tried during his reign. Ancient historians have many complaints about this, stating that his judgments were variable and sometimes did not follow the law.<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 15. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 33.</ref> He was also easily swayed. Nevertheless, Claudius paid detailed attention to the operation of the judicial system.<ref name=\"Scramuzza ch6\"/>\n\nHe extended the summer court session, as well as the winter term, by shortening the traditional breaks. Claudius also made a law requiring plaintiffs to remain in the city while their cases were pending, as defendants had previously been required to do. These measures had the effect of clearing out the docket. The minimum age for jurors was also raised to 25 in order to ensure a more experienced jury pool.<ref name=\"Scramuzza ch6\">Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 6</ref>\n\nClaudius also settled disputes in the provinces. He freed the island of [[Rhodes]] from Roman rule for their good faith and exempted Ilium ([[Troy#Classical Ilium (Ilion)|Troy]]) from taxes. Early in his reign, the [[Greeks]] and [[Jews of Alexandria]] sent him two embassies at once after riots broke out between the two communities. This resulted in the famous \"Letter to the Alexandrians\", which reaffirmed Jewish rights in the city but also forbade them to move in more families en masse. According to [[Josephus]], he then reaffirmed the rights and freedoms of all the [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jews in the Empire]].<ref>Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XIX.5.3 (287).</ref>\n\nOne of Claudius's investigators discovered that many old Roman citizens based in the city of Tridentum (the modern [[Trento]]) were not in fact citizens.<ref>Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7, p.129</ref> The Emperor issued a declaration, contained in the ''[[Tabula clesiana]]'', that they would be considered to hold citizenship from then on, since to strip them of their status would cause major problems. However, in individual cases, Claudius punished false assumption of citizenship harshly, making it a capital offense. Similarly, any freedmen found to be laying false claim to membership of the [[Roman equestrian order]] were sold back into slavery.<ref>Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 7</ref>\n\nNumerous edicts were issued throughout Claudius' reign. These were on a number of topics, everything from medical advice to moral judgments. A famous medical example is one promoting [[Taxus baccata|yew]] juice as a cure for [[snakebite]].<ref>Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 16</ref> Suetonius wrote that he is even said to have thought of an edict allowing public flatulence for good health.<ref>Suetonius, ''Claud.'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#32 32]</ref> One of the more famous edicts concerned the status of sick slaves. Masters had been abandoning ailing slaves at the [[Temple of Asclepius, Rome|temple of Aesculapius]] on [[Tiber Island]] to die instead of providing them with medical assistance and care, and then reclaiming them if they lived. Claudius ruled that slaves who were thus abandoned and recovered after such treatment would be free. Furthermore, masters who chose to kill slaves rather than take care of them were liable to be charged with murder.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Claudius*.html#25 Suetonius, ''Claud.'' 51]</ref>\n\n===Public works===\nClaudius embarked on many public works throughout his reign, both in the capital and in the provinces. He built two [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], the [[Aqua Claudia]], begun by [[Caligula]], and the [[Anio Novus]]. These entered the city in 52 AD and met at the [[Porta Maggiore]]. He also restored a third, the [[Aqua Virgo]].\n\n[[File:Esquilino - Porta Maggiore - st1.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Porta Maggiore]] aqueduct in Rome]]\nHe paid special attention to transportation. Throughout [[Italy]] and the provinces he built roads and canals. Among these was a large canal leading from the [[Rhine]] to the sea, as well as a road from Italy to Germany&nbsp;\u2013 both begun by his father, Drusus. Closer to Rome, he built a navigable canal on the [[Tiber]], leading to [[Portus]], his new port just north of [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]]. This port was constructed in a semicircle with two [[Mole (architecture)|moles]] and a lighthouse at its mouth. The construction also had the effect of reducing flooding in Rome.\n\nThe port at Ostia was part of Claudius' solution to the constant grain shortages that occurred in winter, after the Roman shipping season. The other part of his solution was to insure the ships of grain merchants who were willing to risk travelling to Egypt in the off-season. He also granted their sailors special privileges, including citizenship and exemption from the [[Lex Papia Poppaea|Lex Papia-Poppaea]], a law that regulated marriage. In addition, he repealed the taxes that [[Caligula]] had instituted on food, and further reduced taxes on communities suffering [[drought]] or [[famine]].\n\nThe last part of Claudius' plan was to increase the amount of arable land in Italy. This was to be achieved by draining the [[Fucine lake]], which would have the added benefit of making the nearby river navigable year-round.<ref>Tacitus ''Ann.'' XII 57</ref> A tunnel was dug through the lake bed, but the plan was a failure. The tunnel was crooked and not large enough to carry the water, which caused it to back up when opened. The resultant flood washed out a large gladiatorial exhibition held to commemorate the opening, causing Claudius to run for his life along with the other spectators. The draining of the lake continued to present a problem well into the Middle Ages. It was finally achieved by the Prince [[Torlonia]] in the 19th century, producing over {{convert|160000|acre|km2}} of new arable land. <ref>Scramuzza (1940), Chap. 9, pp. 173\u20134</ref> He expanded the Claudian tunnel to three times its original size.\n\n===Claudius and the Senate===\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = \n| width = \n| image1 = Denarius of Claudius (YORYM 2001 1433) obverse.jpg\n| caption1 = Obverse of Claudius' denarius\n| image2 = Denarius of Claudius (YORYM 2001 1433) reverse.jpg\n| caption2 = Reverse of Claudius' denarius with \"S C\" meaning \"[[Senatus consultum]]\"\n}}Because of the circumstances of his accession, Claudius took great pains to please the Senate. During regular sessions, the Emperor sat among the Senate body, speaking in turn. When introducing a law, he sat on a bench between the consuls in his position as holder of the power of [[Tribune]] (the Emperor could not officially serve as a Tribune of the Plebes as he was a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patrician]], but it was a power taken by previous rulers). He refused to accept all his predecessors' titles (including [[Imperator]]) at the beginning of his reign, preferring to earn them in due course. He allowed the Senate to issue its own bronze coinage for the first time since Augustus. He also put the Imperial provinces of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]] and [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] back under Senate control.\n\nClaudius set about remodeling the Senate into a more efficient, representative body. He chided the senators about their reluctance to debate bills introduced by himself, as noted in the fragments of a surviving speech:\n\n{{quote|If you accept these proposals, Conscript Fathers, say so at once and simply, in accordance with your convictions. If you do not accept them, find alternatives, but do so here and now; or if you wish to take time for consideration, take it, provided you do not forget that you must be ready to pronounce your opinion whenever you may be summoned to meet. It ill befits the dignity of the Senate that the consul designate should repeat the phrases of the consuls word for word as his opinion, and that every one else should merely say 'I approve', and that then, after leaving, the assembly should announce 'We debated'.<ref>English translation of Berlin papyrus by W.D. Hogarth, in Momigliano (1934).</ref>}}\n\nIn 47 he assumed the office of ''[[Roman censor|censor]]'' with [[Lucius Vitellius]], which had been allowed to lapse for some time. He struck the names of many senators and equites who no longer met qualifications, but showed respect by allowing them to resign in advance. At the same time, he sought to admit eligible men from the provinces. The [[Lyon Tablet]] preserves his speech on the admittance of Gallic senators, in which he addresses the Senate with reverence but also with criticism for their disdain of these men. He even jokes about how the Senate had admitted members from beyond [[Gallia Narbonensis]] ([[Lyons, France]]), i.e. himself.  He also increased the number of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Patricians]] by adding new families to the dwindling number of noble lines. Here he followed the precedent of [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] and [[Julius Caesar]].\n\nNevertheless, many in the Senate remained hostile to Claudius, and many plots were made on his life. This hostility carried over into the historical accounts. As a result, Claudius reduced the Senate's power for the sake of efficiency. The administration of Ostia was turned over to an Imperial [[Promagistrate|Procurator]] after construction of the port. Administration of many of the empire's financial concerns was turned over to Imperial appointees and freedmen. This led to further resentment and suggestions that these same freedmen were ruling the Emperor.\n\n==== Plots and coup attempts ====\nSeveral [[coup]] attempts were made during Claudius' reign, resulting in the deaths of many senators. [[Appius Silanus]] was executed early in Claudius' reign under questionable circumstances.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Shortly after, a large rebellion was undertaken by the Senator [[Lucius Annius Vinicianus|Vinicianus]] and [[Lucius Arruntius Camillus Scribonianus|Scribonianus]], the governor of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], and gained quite a few senatorial supporters. It ultimately failed because of the reluctance of Scribonianus' troops, which led to the [[suicide]] of the main conspirators.\n\nMany other senators tried different conspiracies and were condemned. Claudius' son-in-law [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Claudia Antonia's first husband)|Pompeius Magnus]] was executed for his part in a conspiracy with his father Crassus Frugi. Another plot involved the consulars Lusiius Saturninus, Cornelius Lupus, and Pompeius Pedo.\n\nIn 46, [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus#Family|Asinius Gallus]], the grandson of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Asinius Pollio]], and [[Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus]] were exiled for a plot hatched with several of Claudius' own freedmen. [[Valerius Asiaticus]] was executed without public trial for unknown reasons. The ancient sources say the charge was [[adultery]], and that Claudius was tricked into issuing the punishment. However, Claudius singles out Asiaticus for special damnation in his speech on the Gauls, which dates over a year later, suggesting that the charge must have been much more serious.\n\nAsiaticus had been a claimant to the throne in the chaos following Caligula's death and a co-consul with the Titus Statilius Taurus Corvinus mentioned above. Most of these conspiracies took place before Claudius' term as [[Roman censor|Censor]], and may have induced him to review the Senatorial rolls. The conspiracy of [[Gaius Silius]] in the year after his Censorship, 48, is detailed in the section discussing Claudius' third wife, [[Messalina]]. Suetonius states that a total of 35 senators and 300 knights were executed for offenses during Claudius' reign.<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 29.</ref> Needless to say, the responses to these conspiracies could not have helped Senate-emperor relations.\n\n===Secretariat and centralization of powers===\nClaudius was hardly the first emperor to use [[Freedman|freedmen]] to help with the day-to-day running of the Empire. He was, however, forced to increase their role as the powers of the ''princeps'' became more centralized and the burden larger. This was partly due to the ongoing hostility of the Senate, as mentioned above, but also due to his respect for the senators. Claudius did not want free-born magistrates to have to serve under him, as if they were not peers.\n\nThe secretariat was divided into bureaus, with each being placed under the leadership of one freedman. [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] was the secretary of correspondence. [[Pallas (freedman)|Pallas]] became the secretary of the treasury. [[Gaius Julius Callistus|Callistus]] became secretary of justice. There was a fourth bureau for miscellaneous issues, which was put under [[Polybius (freedman)|Polybius]] until his execution for treason. The freedmen could also officially speak for the Emperor, as when Narcissus addressed the troops in Claudius' stead before the conquest of Britain.<ref name=\"Tac\">Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 65. Seneca ''Ad Polybium.''</ref>\n\nSince these were important positions, the senators were aghast at their being placed in the hands of former slaves. If freedmen had total control of money, letters, and law, it seemed it would not be hard for them to manipulate the Emperor. This is exactly the accusation put forth by the ancient sources. However, these same sources admit that the freedmen were loyal to Claudius.<ref name=\"Tac\"/>\n\nHe was similarly appreciative of them and gave them due credit for policies where he had used their advice. However, if they showed treasonous inclinations, the Emperor did punish them with just force, as in the case of Polybius and Pallas' brother, [[Antonius Felix|Felix]]. There is no evidence that the character of Claudius' policies and edicts changed with the rise and fall of the various freedmen, suggesting that he was firmly in control throughout.\n\nRegardless of the extent of their political power, the freedmen did manage to amass wealth through their positions. [[Pliny the Elder]] notes that several of them were richer than [[Crassus]], the richest man of the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]].<ref>Pliny ''Natural History'' 134.</ref>\n\n===Religious reforms===\n[[File:Claudius (M.A.N. Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Claudius, [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]]]]\nClaudius, as the author of a treatise on Augustus' religious reforms, felt himself in a good position to institute some of his own. He had strong opinions about the proper form for state religion. He refused the request of Alexandrian Greeks to dedicate a temple to his divinity, saying that only gods may choose new gods. He restored lost days to festivals and got rid of many extraneous celebrations added by Caligula. He re-instituted old observances and archaic language.\n\nClaudius was concerned with the spread of eastern mysteries within the city and searched for more Roman replacements. He emphasized the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] which had been practiced by so many during the Republic. He expelled foreign astrologers, and at the same time rehabilitated the old Roman soothsayers (known as [[haruspices]]) as a replacement. He was especially hard on [[Druidism]], because of its incompatibility with the Roman state religion and its [[Proselytism|proselytizing]] activities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nClaudius forbade proselytizing in any religion, even in those regions where he allowed natives to worship freely.\n\n{{main|Claudius' expulsion of Jews from Rome}}\n\nIt is also reported that at one time he expelled the Jews from Rome, probably because the Jews within the city caused continuous disturbances at the instigation of [[Chrestus]].<ref>There is some debate about what actually happened. It is reported by Suetonius and in Acts (18:2), Cassius Dio minimizes the event and Josephus\u2014who was reporting on Jewish events\u2014does not mention it at all. Some scholars hold that it didn't happen, while others have only a few missionaries expelled for the short term.</ref>\n\n===Public games and entertainments===\nAccording to Suetonius, Claudius was extraordinarily fond of games. He is said to have risen with the crowd after gladiatorial matches and given unrestrained praise to the fighters.<ref>Suet. Claud. 12</ref> Claudius also presided over many new and original events. Soon after coming into power, Claudius instituted games to be held in honor of his father on the latter's birthday.<ref>Suet. Claud. 11</ref> Annual games were also held in honour of his accession, and took place at the Praetorian camp where Claudius had first been proclaimed Emperor.<ref name=\"Suet\">Suet. Claud. 21</ref>\n\nClaudius organised a performance of the [[Secular Games]], marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of Rome. Augustus had performed the same games less than a century prior. Augustus' excuse was that the interval for the games was 110 years, not 100, but his date actually did not qualify under either reasoning.<ref name=\"Suet\"/> Claudius also presented naval battles to mark the attempted draining of the [[Fucine Lake]], as well as many other public games and shows.\n\nAt Ostia, in front of a crowd of spectators, Claudius fought a [[killer whale]] which was trapped in the harbour. The event was witnessed by [[Pliny the Elder]]:\n\n{{quote|A killer whale was actually seen in the harbour of Ostia, locked in combat with the emperor Claudius. She had come when he was completing the construction of the harbour, drawn there by the wreck of a ship bringing leather hides from Gaul, and feeding there over a number of days, had made a furrow in the shallows: the waves had raised up such a mound of sand that she couldn't turn around at all, and while she was pursuing her banquet as the waves moved it shorewards, her back stuck up out of the water like the overturned keel of a boat. The Emperor ordered that a large array of nets be stretched across the mouths of the harbour, and setting out in person with the Praetorian cohorts gave a show to the Roman people, soldiers showering lances from attacking ships, one of which I saw swamped by the beast's waterspout and sunk.\u2014\"''Historia Naturalis''\" IX.14\u201315.<ref>[http://www.ostia-antica.org/~atexts/plinsen.htm Translation of] Pliny's ''Historia Naturalis''</ref>}}\n\nClaudius also restored and adorned many public venues in Rome. At the [[Circus Maximus]], the turning posts and starting stalls were replaced in marble and embellished, and an embankment was probably added to prevent flooding of the track.<ref>Humphrey, John, Roman circuses: arenas for chariot racing, University of California Press, 1986, pp. 100-101</ref>  Claudius also reinforced or extended the seating rules that reserved front seating at the Circus for senators.<ref name=\"Suet\"/> Claudius rebuilt [[Pompey's Theatre]] after it had been destroyed by fire, organising special fights at the re-dedication which he observed from a special platform in the orchestra box.<ref name=\"Suet\"/>\n\n==Marriages and personal life==\nSuetonius and the other ancient authors accused Claudius of being dominated by women and wives, and of being a [[Womanizing|womanizer]].\n\nClaudius married four times, after two failed betrothals. The first betrothal was to his distant cousin [[Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)|Aemilia Lepida]], but was broken for political reasons. The second was to [[Livia Medullina]], which ended with Medullina's sudden death on their wedding day.\n\n===Plautia Urgulanilla===\n[[Plautia Urgulanilla]] was the granddaughter of Livia's confidant [[Urgulania]]. During their marriage she gave birth to a son, Claudius Drusus. Drusus died of asphyxiation in his early teens, shortly after becoming engaged to Junilla, the daughter of [[Sejanus]].\n\nClaudius later divorced Urgulanilla for adultery and on suspicion of murdering her sister-in-law Apronia. When Urgulanilla gave birth after the divorce, Claudius [[repudiate]]d the baby girl, Claudia, as the father was allegedly one of his own freedmen. This action made him later the target of criticism by his enemies.\n{{multiple image|direction=vertical\n|image1=Domus Romana, Rabat 0646.jpg\n|width1=100\n|image2=Ritratto di claudia ottavia, da roma, via varese.JPG\n|width2=100\n|caption1=Claudia Antonia\n|caption2=Claudia Octavia\n}}\n\n===Aelia Paetina===\nSoon after (possibly in 28), Claudius married [[Aelia Paetina]], a relative of Sejanus, if not Sejanus's adoptive sister. During their marriage, Claudius and Paetina had a daughter, [[Claudia Antonia]]. He later divorced her after the marriage became a political liability, although Leon (1948) suggests it may have been due to emotional and mental abuse by Paetina.\n\n===Valeria Messalina===\n[[Image:Messalinaandbritannicus.jpg|thumb|250px|Messalina holding her son Britannicus, [[Louvre]]]]\nSome years after divorcing Aelia Paetina, in 38 or early 39, Claudius married [[Valeria Messalina]], who was his first cousin once removed and closely allied with Caligula's circle. Shortly thereafter, she gave birth to a daughter, [[Claudia Octavia]]. A son, first named Tiberius Claudius Germanicus, and later known as [[Britannicus]], was born just after Claudius' accession.\n\nThis marriage ended in tragedy. The ancient historians allege that Messalina was a [[Hypersexuality|nymphomaniac]] who was regularly unfaithful to Claudius\u2014[[Tacitus]] states she went so far as to compete with a [[prostitute]] to see who could have the most sexual partners in a night<ref>Tac. ''Ann.'' XI 10. Also Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LXI 31, and Pliny ''Nat. Hist.'' X 172.</ref>\u2014and manipulated his policies in order to amass wealth. In 48, Messalina married her lover [[Gaius Silius (consul designatus 49 AD)|Gaius Silius]] in a public ceremony while Claudius was at [[Ostia Antica (archaeological site)|Ostia]].\n\nSources disagree as to whether or not she divorced the Emperor first, and whether the intention was to usurp the throne. Under Roman law, the spouse needed to be informed that he or she had been divorced before a new marriage could take place; the sources state that Claudius was in total ignorance until after the marriage.<ref>{{cite book| title=Claudius| author=Barbara Levick| publisher=Yale University Press| year=1990| p=67}}</ref> Scramuzza, in his biography, suggests that Silius may have convinced Messalina that Claudius was doomed, and the union was her only hope of retaining rank and protecting her children.<ref>Scramuzza (1940) p.&nbsp;90. Momigliano (1934) pp.&nbsp;6\u20137. Levick (1990) p.&nbsp;19.</ref> The historian [[Tacitus]] suggests that Claudius's ongoing term as Censor may have prevented him from noticing the affair before it reached such a critical point.<ref>Tac.

Penguin Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-7394-2025-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Agrippina the Younger===\nClaudius did marry once more. The ancient sources tell that his freedmen put forward three candidates, [[Caligula]]'s third wife [[Lollia Paulina]], Claudius's divorced second wife [[Aelia Paetina]] and Claudius's niece [[Agrippina the Younger]]. According to Suetonius, Agrippina won out through her feminine wiles.<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.</ref>\n[[File:Ner\u00f3n y Agripina.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Sculpture of Agrippina crowning her young son Nero (c. 54\u201359&nbsp;AD)]]\n\nThe truth is probably more political. The attempted [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by Silius and Messalina had probably made Claudius realize the weakness of his position as a member of the Claudian but not the Julian family. This weakness was compounded by the fact that he did not yet have an obvious adult heir, Britannicus being just a boy.<ref name=\"Scramuzza91-92\">Scramuzza (1940) pp.&nbsp;91\u201392. See also Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 6, 7; Suet. ''Claud.'' 26.</ref>\n\nAgrippina was one of the few remaining descendants of Augustus, and her son Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus (the future Emperor [[Nero]]) was one of the last males of the Imperial family. Coup attempts could rally around the pair and Agrippina was already showing such ambition. It has been suggested that the Senate may have pushed for the marriage, to end the feud between the Julian and Claudian branches.<ref name=\"Scramuzza91-92\"/> This feud dated back to Agrippina's [[Agrippina the Elder|mother's]] actions against Tiberius after the death of her husband [[Germanicus]] (Claudius's brother), actions which Tiberius had gladly punished. In any case, Claudius accepted Agrippina and later adopted the newly mature Nero as his son.\n\nNero was married to Claudius' daughter Octavia, made joint heir with the underage [[Britannicus]], and promoted; Augustus had similarly named his grandson [[Postumus Agrippa]] and his stepson [[Tiberius]] as joint heirs,<ref>Levick (1990) p.&nbsp;70. See also Scramuzza (1940) p.&nbsp;92.</ref> and Tiberius had named [[Caligula]] joint heir with his grandson [[Tiberius Gemellus]]. Adoption of adults or near adults was an old tradition in Rome, when a suitable natural adult heir was unavailable as was the case during Britannicus' minority. Claudius may have previously looked to adopt one of his sons-in-law to protect his own reign.<ref>Oost (1958).</ref>\n\n[[Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix]], who was married to Claudius's daughter [[Claudia Antonia]], was only descended from Octavia and Antony on one side&nbsp;\u2013 not close enough to the Imperial family to prevent doubts (although that did not stop others from making him the object of a coup attempt against Nero a few years later). Besides which, he was the half-brother of [[Valeria Messalina]] and at this time those wounds were still fresh. [[Nero]] was more popular with the general public as the grandson of Germanicus and the direct descendant of Augustus.\n\n==Claudius' affliction and personality==\n[[File:Statue Claudius Vatikanische Museen.jpg|thumb|220px|Claudius depicted as the [[Jupiter (mythology)|Roman god Jupiter]]]]\nThe historian [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]] describes the physical manifestations of Claudius' affliction in relatively good detail.<ref name = \"boyjnt\">Suet. ''Claud.'' 30.</ref> His knees were weak and gave way under him and his head shook. He stammered and his speech was confused. He slobbered and his nose ran when he was excited. The [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] states in his ''[[Apocolocyntosis]]'' that Claudius' voice belonged to no land animal, and that his hands were weak as well.<ref>Seneca ''Apocolo.'' 5, 6.</ref>\n\nHowever, he showed no physical deformity, as Suetonius notes that when calm and seated he was a tall, well-built figure of ''[[Dignitas (Roman concept)|dignitas]]''.<ref name = \"boyjnt\"/> When angered or stressed, his symptoms became worse. Historians agree that this condition improved upon his accession to the throne.<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 31.</ref> Claudius himself claimed that he had exaggerated his ailments to save his life.<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 38.</ref>\n\nModern assessments of his health have changed several times in the past century. Prior to [[World War II]], [[infantile paralysis]] (or polio) was widely accepted as the cause. This is the diagnosis used in [[Robert Graves]]' [[Claudius (novel)|Claudius novels]], first published in the 1930s. Polio does not explain many of the described symptoms, however, and a more recent theory implicates [[cerebral palsy]] as the cause, as outlined by Ernestine Leon.<ref>Leon (1948).</ref> [[Tourette syndrome]] has also been considered a possibility.<ref>Burden, George.

LX 2, 3.</ref>\n\nClaudius' extant works present a different view, painting a picture of an intelligent, scholarly, well-read, and conscientious administrator with an eye to detail and justice. Thus, Claudius becomes an enigma. Since the discovery of his \"[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/claualex.html Letter to the Alexandrians]\" in the last century, much work has been done to rehabilitate Claudius and determine where the truth lies.\n\n==Scholarly works and their impact==\nClaudius wrote copiously throughout his life. [[Arnaldo Momigliano]] states that during the reign of Tiberius&nbsp;\u2013 which covers the peak of Claudius' literary career&nbsp;\u2013 it became impolitic to speak of republican Rome. The trend among the young historians was to either write about the new empire or obscure antiquarian subjects. Claudius was the rare scholar who covered both.<ref>Momigliano (1934) pp.&nbsp;4\u20136.</ref>\n\nBesides the history of Augustus' reign that caused him so much grief, his major works included ''Tyrrhenica'', a twenty-book [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] history, and ''Carchedonica'', an eight-volume history of [[Carthage]],<ref>''The Oxford Companion to Classical Literature'', 1937  p.107</ref> as well as an [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] dictionary. He also wrote a [[De arte aleae|book on dice-playing]].  Despite the general avoidance of the Republican era, he penned a defense of [[Cicero]] against the charges of [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus|Asinius Gallus]]. Modern historians have used this to determine the nature of his politics and of the aborted chapters of his civil war history.\n\n[[File:Claudian letters.svg|thumb|The [[Claudian letters]].]]\nHe proposed a reform of the [[Latin alphabet]] by the addition of [[Claudian letters|three new letters]], two of which served the function of the modern letters ''W'' and ''Y''. He officially instituted the change during his censorship but they did not survive his reign. Claudius also tried to revive the old custom of putting dots between successive words (Classical Latin was written with no spacing). Finally, he wrote an eight-volume autobiography that Suetonius describes as lacking in taste.<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 41.</ref> Since Claudius (like most of the members of his dynasty) harshly criticized his predecessors and relatives in surviving speeches,<ref>See Claudius' letter to the people of Trent (linked below), in which he refers to the \"obstinate retirement\" of Tiberius. See also Josephus ''Ant Iud.'' XIX, where an edict of Claudius refers to Caligula's \"madness and lack of understanding.\"</ref> it is not hard to imagine the nature of Suetonius' charge.\n\nNone of the works survive but live on as sources for the surviving histories of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Suetonius quotes Claudius' autobiography once and must have used it as a source numerous times. Tacitus uses Claudius' arguments for the orthographical innovations mentioned above and may have used him for some of the more antiquarian passages in his annals. Claudius is the source for numerous passages of [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]''.<ref>See Momigliano (1934) Chap.&nbsp;1, note&nbsp;20 (p.&nbsp;83). Pliny credits him by name in Book VII 35.</ref>\n\nThe influence of historical study on Claudius is obvious. In his speech on Gallic senators, he uses a version of the founding of Rome identical to that of Livy, his tutor in adolescence. The speech is meticulous in details, a common mark of all his extant works, and he goes into long digressions on related matters. This indicates a deep knowledge of a variety of historical subjects that he could not help but share. Many of the public works instituted in his reign were based on plans first suggested by [[Julius Caesar]]. Levick believes this emulation of Caesar may have spread to all aspects of his policies.<ref>Levick (1978).</ref>\n\nHis censorship seems to have been based on those of his ancestors, particularly [[Appius Claudius Caecus]], and he used the office to put into place many policies based on those of Republican times. This is when many of his religious reforms took effect, and his building efforts greatly increased during his tenure. In fact, his assumption of the office of Censor may have been motivated by a desire to see his academic labors bear fruit. For example, he believed (as most Romans did) that his ancestor [[Appius Claudius Caecus]] had used the censorship to introduce [[R|the letter \"R\"]]<ref>Ryan (1993) refers to the historian [[Varro]]'s account of the introduction</ref> and so used his own term to introduce his new letters.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Togato con tesa dell'imperatore claudio, inv. 2221.JPG|thumb|upright|A statue of Claudius in the [[Vatican Museums|Vatican museum]].]]\nThe consensus of ancient historians was that Claudius was murdered by poison&nbsp;\u2013 possibly contained in mushrooms or on a feather&nbsp;\u2013 and died in the early hours of 13 October 54 AD.<ref>cf. Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 66-67.</ref>\n\nNearly all implicate his final wife, [[Agrippina the Younger|Agrippina]], as the instigator. Agrippina and Claudius had become more combative in the months leading up to his death. This carried on to the point where Claudius openly lamented his bad wives, and began to comment on Britannicus' approaching manhood with an eye towards restoring his status within the imperial family.<ref>Suet. ''Claud.'' 43</ref> Agrippina had motive in ensuring the succession of Nero before Britannicus could gain power.\n\nSome implicate either his taster [[Halotus]], his doctor [[Gaius Stertinius Xenophon|Xenophon]], or the infamous poisoner [[Locusta]] as the administrator of the fatal substance.<ref>Accounts of his death: Suet. ''Claud.'' 43, 44. Tac. ''Ann.'' XII 64, 66\u201367. Josephus ''Ant. Iud.'' XX 148, 151. Dio ''Rom. Hist.'' LX 34. Pliny ''Natural History'' II xxiii 92, XI lxxiii 189, XXII xlvi 92.</ref> Some say he died after prolonged suffering following a single dose at dinner, and some have him recovering only to be poisoned again.<ref name=Suet44>Suet. ''Claud.'' 44</ref> Among contemporary sources, [[Seneca the Younger]] ascribed the emperor's death to natural causes, while Josephus only spoke of rumors on his poisoning.<ref>Flavius Josephus Antiquities of the Jews 19:67; 20:148</ref>\n\nIn modern times, some authors have cast doubt on whether Claudius was murdered or merely succumbed to illness or old age.<ref>Scramuzza (1940) pp. 92\u201393 says that tradition makes every emperor the victim of foul play, so we can't know if Claudius was truly murdered. Indeed, the Emperor appears to have been seriously ill since at least 53 AD. Levick (1990) pp.&nbsp;76\u201377. raises the possibility that Claudius was killed by the stress of fighting with Agrippina over the succession, but concludes that the timing makes murder the most likely cause.</ref> Some modern scholars claim the near universality of the accusations in ancient texts lends credence to the crime.<ref>Levick (1990); also as opposed to the murder of Augustus, which is only found in Tacitus and Dio where he quotes Tacitus. Suetonius, an inveterate gossip, doesn't mention it at all.</ref> Claudius' ashes were interred in the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]] on 24 October 54 AD, after a funeral that mimicked that of his great-uncle Augustus 40 years earlier.\n\n==After death==\n\n===Divine honours===\nAlready, while alive, he received the widespread private worship of a living [[Princeps]]<ref>Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-927548-9}}</ref> and was worshipped in [[Britannia]] in his own [[Temple of Claudius, Colchester|temple in Camulodunum]].\n\nClaudius was deified by Nero and the Senate almost immediately.<ref>Suet. ''Nero'' 9</ref> Those who regard this homage as cynical should note that, cynical or not, such a move would hardly have benefited those involved, had Claudius been \"hated\", as some commentators, both modern and historic, characterize him. Many of Claudius' less solid supporters quickly became Nero's men. Claudius' will had been changed shortly before his death to either recommend Nero and Britannicus jointly or perhaps just Britannicus, who would have been considered an adult man according to Roman law only a few months later.\n\n===Views of the new regime===\nAgrippina had sent away [[Tiberius Claudius Narcissus|Narcissus]] shortly before Claudius' death, and now murdered the freedman. The last act of this secretary of letters was to burn all of Claudius' correspondence\u2014most likely so it could not be used against him and others in an already hostile new regime. Thus Claudius' private words about his own policies and motives were lost to history. Just as Claudius had criticized his predecessors in official edicts (see below), Nero often criticized the deceased Emperor and many of Claudius' laws and edicts were disregarded under the reasoning that he was too stupid and senile to have meant them.<ref>Suet. ''Nero'' 33</ref>\n\n[[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s [[Apocolocyntosis]] mocks the deification of Claudius and reinforces the view of Claudius as an unpleasant fool; this remained the official view for the duration of Nero's reign. Eventually Nero stopped referring to his deified adoptive father at all, and realigned with his birth family. Claudius' temple was left unfinished after only some of the foundation had been laid down. Eventually the site was overtaken by Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]].<ref name = \"iiovah\">Levick (1990)</ref>\n\n===Flavian and later perspectives===\nThe [[Flavians]], who had risen to prominence under Claudius, took a different tack. They were in a position where they needed to shore up their legitimacy, but also justify the fall of the Julio-Claudians. They reached back to Claudius in contrast with Nero, to show that they were good associated with good. Commemorative coins were issued of Claudius and his son [[Britannicus]], who had been a friend of the Emperor [[Titus]] (Titus was born in 39, Britannicus was born in 41). When Nero's [[Domus Aurea|Golden House]] was burned, the [[Temple of Claudius]] was finally completed on the Caelian Hill.<ref name = \"iiovah\"/>\n\nHowever, as the Flavians became established, they needed to emphasize their own credentials more, and their references to Claudius ceased. Instead, he was lumped with the other emperors of the fallen dynasty. His state cult in Rome probably continued until the abolition of all such cults of dead Emperors by [[Maximinus Thrax]] in 237\u2013238.<ref>Gradel I. Emperor worship and Roman religion.

Emperor worship and Roman religion. Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-927548-9}} p.367</ref>\n\n===Views of ancient historians===\nThe main ancient historians [[Tacitus]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], and [[Cassius Dio]] all wrote after the last of the Flavians had gone. All three were senators or ''equites''. They took the side of the Senate in most conflicts with the Princeps, invariably viewing him as being in the wrong. This resulted in biases, both conscious and unconscious. Suetonius lost access to the official archives shortly after beginning his work. He was forced to rely on second-hand accounts when it came to Claudius (with the exception of Augustus' letters, which had been gathered earlier). Suetonius painted Claudius as a ridiculous figure, belittling many of his acts and attributing the objectively good works to his retinue.<ref>Scramuzza, p.&nbsp;29</ref>\n\nTacitus wrote a narrative for his fellow senators and fitted each of the emperors into a simple mold of his choosing.<ref>Vessey (1971)</ref> He wrote of Claudius as a passive pawn and an idiot in affairs relating to the palace and often in public life. During his censorship of 47-8 Tacitus allows the reader a glimpse of a Claudius who is more statesmanlike (XI.23-25), but it is a mere glimpse. Tacitus is usually held to have 'hidden' his use of Claudius' writings and to have omitted Claudius' character from his works.<ref>Griffin (1990). ''Ann.'' XI 14 is often thought to be a good example: the digression on the history of writing is actually Claudius' own argument for his new letters, and fits in with his personality and extant writings. Tacitus makes no explicit attribution - and so there exists the possibility that the digression is Tacitus' own work or derivative of another source</ref> Even his version of Claudius' Lyons tablet speech is edited to be devoid of the Emperor's personality. Dio was less biased, but seems to have used Suetonius and Tacitus as sources. Thus the conception of Claudius as the weak fool, controlled by those he supposedly ruled, was preserved for the ages.\n\nAs time passed, Claudius was mostly forgotten outside of the historians' accounts. His books were lost first, as their antiquarian subjects became unfashionable. In the 2nd century, [[Pertinax]], who shared his birthday, became emperor, overshadowing commemoration of Claudius.<ref>Levick. ''Claudius'' p. 194</ref>\n\n==In modern literature, film and radio==\n*The best known fictional representation of the Emperor Claudius was contained in the books ''[[I, Claudius]]'' and ''[[Claudius the God]]'' (published in 1934 and 1935, respectively) by [[Robert Graves]], both written in the [[Grammatical person|first-person]] to give the reader the impression that they are Claudius' [[autobiography]]. Graves employed a fictive artifice to suggest that they were recently discovered, genuine translations of Claudius' writings. Claudius' extant letters, speeches, and sayings were incorporated into the text (mostly in the second book, ''Claudius the God''), to add authenticity.\n**In 1937, director [[Josef von Sternberg]] attempted a film version of ''[[I, Claudius (film)|I, Claudius]]'', with [[Charles Laughton]] as Claudius. However, the lead actress, [[Merle Oberon]], suffered a near-fatal car accident and the movie was never finished. The surviving reels were featured in the BBC documentary ''The Epic That Never Was'' (1965). The motion picture rights for a new film eventually passed to producer [[Scott Rudin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/movies/movie-synopsis/i-claudius.1/|title=I, Claudius (2009)&nbsp;\u2013 Synopsis|accessdate=21 January 2011}}</ref>\n**Graves's two books were the basis for a British television adaptation ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', produced by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. The series starred [[Derek Jacobi]] as Claudius and was broadcast in 1976 on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].<ref>{{Citation|title=I, Claudius|date=1977-11-06|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074006/|accessdate=2016-04-14}}</ref> It was a substantial critical success, and won several [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. The series was later broadcast in the United States on ''[[Masterpiece Theatre]]'' in 1977. The 1996 7-VHS release and the later DVD release of the television series, include ''The Epic That Never Was'' documentary.\n**A radio adaptation of the Graves novels by [[Robin Brooks]] and directed by [[Jonquil Panting]], was broadcast in six one-hour episodes on [[BBC Radio 4]] beginning 4 December 2010. The cast featured [[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Claudius, [[Derek Jacobi]] as Augustus, [[Harriet Walter]] as Livia, [[Tim McInnerny]] as Tiberius and [[Samuel Barnett (actor)|Samuel Barnett]] as Caligula.\n**In 2011, it was announced rights for a miniseries adaptation passed to HBO and BBC2.  Anne Thomopoulos and Jane Tranter, producers of the popular HBO\u2013BBC2 ''[[Rome (TV series)|Rome]]'' miniseries, were attached to the ''I, Claudius'' project.  However, as of 2018, it has yet to be produced, and no release date is pending.\n*The 1954 film ''[[Demetrius and the Gladiators]]'' also portrayed him sympathetically, played by [[Barry Jones (actor)|Barry Jones]].\n*In the 1960 film ''[[Messalina (1960 film)|Messalina]]'', Claudius is portrayed by [[Mino Doro]].\n*On television, [[Freddie Jones]] portrayed Claudius in the 1968 British [[television]] series ''[[The Caesars (TV series)|The Caesars]]''.\n*The 1975 TV Special ''Further Up Pompeii!'' (based on the [[Frankie Howerd]] sit-com ''[[Up Pompeii!]]'') featured [[Cyril Appleton]] as Claudius.\n*In the 1979 motion picture ''[[Caligula (film)|Caligula]]'', where the role was performed by [[Giancarlo Badessi]], Claudius is depicted as an idiot, in contrast to [[Robert Graves]]' portrait of Claudius as a cunning and deeply intelligent man, who is perceived by others to be an idiot.\n*The 1985 made-for-television [[miniseries]] ''A.D.'' features actor [[Richard Kiley]] as Claudius.  Kiley portrays him as thoughtful, but willing to cater to public opinion as well as being under the influence of Agrippina.\n*In the 2004 TV film ''[[Nero (2004 film)|Imperium: Nero]]'', Claudius is portrayed by [[Massimo Dapporto]].\n*There is also a reference to Claudius' suppression of a coup in the movie ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', though the incident is entirely fictional.\n\nIn literature, Claudius and his contemporaries appear in the historical novel ''The Roman'' by [[Mika Waltari]]. Canadian-born science fiction writer [[A. E. van Vogt]] reimagined Robert Graves' Claudius story, in his two novels, ''[[Empire of the Atom]]'' and ''[[The Wizard of Linn]]''.\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Although Cantor himself defined the set in a general, abstract way, the most common modern construction is the '''Cantor ternary set''', built by removing the middle thirds of a line segment. Cantor himself mentioned the ternary construction only in passing, as an example of a more general idea, that of a [[perfect set]] that is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]].\n\n==Construction and formula of the ternary set==\nThe Cantor ternary set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is created by iteratively deleting the [[open interval|open]] middle third from a set of line segments. One starts by deleting the open middle third ({{sfrac|1|3}},&nbsp;{{sfrac|2|3}}) from the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] [0,&nbsp;1], leaving two line segments: [0,&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}] \u222a [{{sfrac|2|3}},&nbsp;1].  Next, the open middle third of each of these remaining segments is deleted, leaving four line segments: [0,&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|9}}] \u222a [{{sfrac|2|9}},&nbsp;{{sfrac|1|3}}]  \u222a [{{sfrac|2|3}},&nbsp;{{sfrac|7|9}}] \u222a [{{sfrac|8|9}},&nbsp;1].

The Cantor ternary set is an example of a [[fractal string]].\n\n[[File:Cantor set binary tree.svg|400px]]\n\nIn arithmetical terms, the Cantor set consists of all real numbers on the [[unit interval]] that are expressible as a [[Ternary numeral system|ternary]] (base 3) fraction using only the digits 0 and 2. As the above diagram illustrates, each point in the Cantor set is uniquely located by a path through an infinitely deep binary tree, where the path turns left or right at each level according to which side of a deleted segment the point lies on. Representing each left turn with 0 and each right turn with 2 yields the ternary fraction for a point. Replacing the \"2\" digits in these fractions with \"1\" digits produces a bijective mapping between the Cantor set and the set of infinite binary sequences.\n\n== Composition ==\nSince the Cantor set is defined as the set of points not excluded, the proportion (i.e., [[Lebesgue measure|measure]]) of the unit interval remaining can be found by total length removed.  This total is the [[geometric progression]]\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^n}{3^{n+1}} = \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{2}{9} + \\frac{4}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} + \\cdots =  \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{2}{3}}\\right) = 1.</math>\n\nSo that the proportion left is  1 &ndash; 1 = 0.\n\nThis calculation suggests that the Cantor set cannot contain any [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] of non-zero length. It may seem surprising that there should be anything left&mdash;after all, the sum of the lengths of the removed intervals is equal to the length of the original interval. However, a closer look at the process reveals that there must be something left, since removing the \"middle third\" of each interval involved removing [[open set]]s (sets that do not include their endpoints). So removing the line segment (<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>,&nbsp;<sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>) from the original interval [0,&nbsp;1] leaves behind the points <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>  and <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>. Subsequent steps do not remove these (or other) endpoints, since the intervals removed are always internal to the intervals remaining.  So the Cantor set is not empty, and in fact contains an uncountably infinite number of points (as follows from the above description in terms of paths in an infinite binary tree).\n\nIt may appear that ''only'' the endpoints of the construction segments are left, but that is not the case either. The number 1/4, for example, has the unique ternary form 0.020202\u2026. It is in the bottom third, and the top ninth of that third, and the bottom twenty-seventh of that ninth, and so on. Since it is never in one of the middle segments, it is never removed. Yet it is also not an endpoint of any middle segment, because it is not a multiple of any power of 1/3.<ref>{{citation\n | last1 = Belcastro | first1 = Sarah-Marie\n | last2 = Green | first2 = Michael\n | date = January 2001\n | doi = 10.2307/2687224\n | issue = 1\n | journal = The College Mathematics Journal\n | page = 55\n | title = The Cantor set contains <math>\\tfrac{1}{4}</math>?

The construction steps, which are [[countable set|countable]], each introduce a finite number of endpoints. Therefore the endpoints are also countable, while the whole Cantor set is not.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Cardinality ===\nIt can be shown that there are as many points left behind in this process as there were to begin with, and that therefore, the Cantor set is [[uncountable set|uncountable]]. To see this, we show that there is a function ''f'' from the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> to the closed interval [0,1] that is [[Surjective function|surjective]] (i.e. ''f'' maps from <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> onto [0,1]) so that the [[cardinality]] of <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is no less than that of [0,1].  Since <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> is a subset of [0,1], its cardinality is also no greater, so the two cardinalities must in fact be equal, by the [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schroeder theorem]].\n\nTo construct this function, consider the points in the [0,&nbsp;1] interval in terms of base 3 (or [[ternary numeral system|ternary]]) notation. \nRecall that some points admit more than one representation in this notation, as for example <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, that can be written as 0.1<sub>3</sub> but also as 0.022222...<sub>3</sub>, and <sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub>, that can be written as 0.2<sub>3</sub> but also as 0.12222...<sub>3</sub>.\n(This alternative recurring representation of a number with a terminating numeral occurs in any  [[Numeral system#Positional systems in detail|positional system]].)\nWhen we remove the middle third, this contains the numbers with ternary numerals of the form 0.1xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> where xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> is strictly between 00000...<sub>3</sub> and 22222...<sub>3</sub>.   So the numbers remaining after the first step consist of\n* Numbers of the form 0.0xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> (including 0.022222...<sub>3</sub> = 1/3)\n* Numbers of the form 0.2xxxxx...<sub>3</sub> (including 0.222222...<sub>3</sub> = 1)\nThis can be summarized by saying that those numbers that admit a ternary representation such that the first digit after the decimal point is not 1 are the ones remaining after the first step.\n\nThe second step removes numbers of the form 0.01xxxx...<sub>3</sub> and 0.21xxxx...<sub>3</sub>, and (with appropriate care for the endpoints) it can be concluded that the remaining numbers are those with a ternary numeral where neither of the first ''two'' digits is 1.  Continuing in this way, for a number not to be excluded at step ''n'', it must have a ternary representation whose ''n''th digit is not 1.  For a number to be in the Cantor set, it must not be excluded at any step, it must admit a numeral representation consisting entirely of 0s and 2s.  It is worth emphasising that numbers like 1, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> = 0.1<sub>3</sub> and <sup>7</sup>/<sub>9</sub> = 0.21<sub>3</sub> are in the Cantor set, as they have ternary numerals consisting entirely of 0s and 2s: 1 = 0.2222...<sub>3</sub>, <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> = 0.022222...<sub>3</sub> and <sup>7</sup>/<sub>9</sub> = 0.2022222...<sub>3</sub>.  So while a number in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> may have either a terminating or a recurring ternary numeral, one of its representations will consist entirely of 0s and 2s.\n\nThe function from <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> to [0,1] is defined by taking the numeral that does consist entirely of 0s and 2s, replacing all the 2s by 1s, and interpreting the sequence as a [[Binary numeral system#Representing real numbers|binary]] representation of a real number.  In a formula,\n\n:<math>f \\bigg( \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty a_k 3^{-k} \\bigg) = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{2} 2^{-k}.</math>\n\nFor any number ''y'' in [0,1], its binary representation can be translated into a ternary representation of a number ''x'' in <math>\\mathcal{C}</math> by replacing all the 1s by 2s.  With this, ''f''(''x'') = ''y'' so that ''y'' is in the range of ''f''.  For instance if ''y'' = <sup>3</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = 0.100110011001...<sub>2</sub>, we write ''x'' = 0.200220022002...<sub>3</sub> = <sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub>.  Consequently, ''f'' is surjective; however, ''f'' is ''not'' [[injective function|injective]] &mdash; the values for which ''f''(''x'') coincides are those at opposing ends of one of the ''middle thirds'' removed.  For instance, <sup>7</sup>/<sub>9</sub> = 0.2022222...<sub>3</sub> and <sup>8</sup>/<sub>9</sub> = 0.2200000...<sub>3</sub> so ''f''(<sup>7</sup>/<sub>9</sub>) = 0.101111...<sub>2</sub> = 0.11<sub>2</sub> = ''f''(<sup>8</sup>/<sub>9</sub>).\n\nSo there are as many points in the Cantor set as there are in [0,&nbsp;1], and the Cantor set is [[countable|uncountable]] (see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). However, the set of endpoints of the removed intervals is countable, so there must be uncountably many numbers in the Cantor set which are not interval endpoints. As noted above, one example of such a number is \u00bc, which can be written as 0.02020202020...<sub>3</sub> in ternary notation.  In fact, given any <math>x\\in[-1,1]</math>, there exist <math>a,b\\in\\mathcal{C}</math> such that <math>x = a-b</math>.  This was first demonstrated by Steinhaus in 1917, who proved, via a geometric argument, the equivalent assertion that <math>\\{(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2:y=x+c\\}\\cap(\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}) \\neq\\emptyset</math> for every <math>c\\in[-1,1]</math>.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Real Analysis|last=Carothers|first=N. L.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-69624-1|location=Cambridge|pages=31\u201332|quote=|via=}}</ref> Since this construction provides an injection from <math>[-1,1]</math> to <math>\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}</math>, we have <math>|\\mathcal{C}\\times\\mathcal{C}|\\geq|[-1,1]|=\\mathfrak{c}</math> as an immediate corollary.  Assuming that <math>|A\\times A|=|A|</math> for any infinite set <math>A</math> (a statement shown to be equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]] by [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]), this provides another demonstration that <math>|\\mathcal{C}|=\\mathfrak{c}</math>.\n\nThe Cantor set contains as many points as the interval from which it is taken, yet itself contains no interval of nonzero length. The irrational numbers have the same property, but the Cantor set has the additional property of being closed, so it is not even [[Dense set|dense]] in any interval, unlike the irrational numbers which are dense in every interval.\n\nIt has been conjectured that all [[algebraic number|algebraic]] irrational numbers are [[normal number|normal]].  Since members of the Cantor set are not normal, this would imply that all members of the Cantor set are either rational or [[transcendental number|transcendental]].\n\n=== Self-similarity ===\nThe Cantor set is the prototype of a [[fractal]]. It is [[self-similar]], because it is equal to two copies of itself, if each copy is shrunk by a factor of 3 and translated. More precisely, the Cantor set is equal to the union of two functions, the left and right self-similarity transformations of itself, <math>T_L(x)=x/3</math> and <math>T_R(x)=(2+x)/3</math>, which leave the Cantor set invariant up to [[homeomorphism]]: <math>T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cong T_R(\\mathcal{C})\\cong \\mathcal{C}=T_L(\\mathcal{C})\\cup T_R(\\mathcal{C}).</math>  \n\nRepeated [[iterated function|iteration]] of <math>T_L</math> and <math>T_R</math> can be visualized as an infinite [[binary tree]]. That is, at each node of the tree, one may consider the subtree to the left or to the right. Taking the set <math>\\{T_L,T_R\\}</math> together with [[function composition]] forms a [[monoid]], the [[dyadic monoid]].\n\nThe [[automorphism]]s of the binary tree are its hyperbolic rotations, and are given by the [[modular group]]. Thus, the Cantor set is a [[homogeneous space]] in the sense that for any two points <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> in the Cantor set <math>\\mathcal{C}</math>, there exists a homeomorphism <math>h:\\mathcal{C}\\to \\mathcal{C}</math> with <math>h(x)=y</math>. An explicit construction of <math>h</math> can be described more easily if we see the Cantor set [[Cantor_set#Topological_and_analytical_properties|as a product space]] of  countably many copies of the discrete space <math>\\{0,1\\}</math>. Then the map <math>h:\\{0,1\\}^\\N\\to\\{0,1\\}^\\N </math> defined by <math>h_n(u):=u_n+x_n+y_n \\mod 2</math> is an involutive homeomorphism exchanging  <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>.\n\n=== Conservation law===\n\nIt has been found that some form of conservation law is always responsible behind scaling and self-similarity. In the case of Cantor set it can be seen that the <math>d_f</math>th moment (where <math>d_f=\\ln(2)/\\ln(3)</math> is the fractal dimension) of all the surviving intervals at any stage of the construction process is equal to constant which is equal to one in the case of Cantor set <ref name=\"KBN95\">{{cite journal | first1=P.

Since the Cantor set is the complement of a [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[open set]]s, it itself is a [[closed set|closed]] subset of the reals, and therefore a [[complete space|complete]] [[metric space]]. Since it is also [[totally bounded]], the [[Heine\u2013Borel theorem]] says that it must be [[compact space|compact]].\n\nFor any point in the Cantor set and any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the point, there is some other number with a ternary numeral of only 0s and 2s, as well as numbers whose ternary numerals contain 1s.  Hence, every point in the Cantor set is an [[accumulation point]] (also called a cluster point or limit point) of the Cantor set, but none is an [[interior point]]. A closed set in which every point is an accumulation point is also called a [[perfect set]] in [[topology]], while a closed subset of the interval with no interior points is [[Nowhere dense set|nowhere dense]] in the interval.\n\nEvery point of the Cantor set is also an accumulation point of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the Cantor set.\n\nFor any two points in the Cantor set, there will be some ternary digit where they differ &mdash; one will have 0 and the other 2.  By splitting the Cantor set into \"halves\" depending on the value of this digit, one obtains a partition of the Cantor set into two closed sets that separate the original two points.  In the [[relative topology]] on the Cantor set, the points have been separated by a [[clopen set]].  Consequently, the Cantor set is [[totally disconnected]].  As a compact totally disconnected [[Hausdorff space]], the Cantor set is an example of a [[Stone space]].\n\nAs a [[topological space]], the Cantor set is naturally [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to the [[product topology|product]] of [[countable|countably many]] copies of the space <math>\\{0, 1\\}</math>, where each copy carries the [[discrete space|discrete topology]]. This is the space of all [[sequence]]s in two digits \n:<math>2^\\mathbb{N}=\\{(x_n)\\mid x_n\\in \\{0,1\\} \\text{ for } n\\in \\mathbb{N}\\}</math>,\n\nwhich can also be identified with the set of [[p-adic numbers|2-adic integers]]. The [[basis (topology)|basis]] for the open sets of the product topology are [[cylinder set]]s; the homeomorphism maps these to the [[subspace topology]] that the Cantor set inherits from the natural topology on the real number line. This characterization of the [[Cantor space]] as a product of compact spaces gives a second proof that Cantor space is compact, via [[Tychonoff's theorem]].\n\nFrom the above characterization, the Cantor set is homeomorphic to the [[p-adic numbers|p-adic integers]], and, if one point is removed from it, to the [[p-adic numbers]].\n\nThe Cantor set is a subset of the reals, which are a [[metric space]] with respect to the [[absolute difference|ordinary distance metric]]; therefore the Cantor set itself is a metric space, by using that same metric. Alternatively, one can use the [[p-adic metric]] on <math>2^\\mathbb{N}</math>: given two sequences <math>(x_n),(y_n)\\in 2^\\mathbb{N}</math>, the distance between them is <math>d((x_n),(y_n)) = 1/k</math>, where <math>k</math> is the smallest index such that <math>x_k \\ne y_k</math>; if there is no such index, then the two sequences are the same, and one defines the distance to be zero. These two metrics generate the same [[topological space|topology]] on the Cantor set.\n\nWe have seen above that the Cantor set is a totally disconnected perfect compact metric space. Indeed, in a sense it is the only one: every nonempty totally disconnected perfect compact metric space is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. See [[Cantor space]] for more on spaces homeomorphic to the Cantor set.\n\nThe Cantor set is sometimes regarded as \"universal\" in the [[Category theory|category]] of [[Compact space|compact]] [[metric space]]s, since any compact metric space is a continuous image of the Cantor set; however this construction is not unique and so the Cantor set is not [[universal property|universal]] in the precise categorical sense. The \"universal\" property has important applications in [[functional analysis]], where it is sometimes known as the ''representation theorem for compact metric spaces''.<ref>{{cite book | first=Stephen | last=Willard | title=General Topology | publisher=Addison-Wesley | date=1968 | asin=B0000EG7Q0}}</ref>\n\nFor any integer ''q'' \u2265 2, the topology on the group G='''Z'''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>\u03c9</sup> (the countable direct sum) is discrete. Although the [[Pontrjagin dual]] \u0393 is also '''Z'''<sub>''q''</sub><sup>\u03c9</sup>, the topology of \u0393 is compact. One can see that \u0393 is totally disconnected and perfect - thus it is homeomorphic to the Cantor set. It is easiest to write out the homeomorphism explicitly in the case ''q''=2. (See Rudin 1962 p 40.)\n\nThe [[geometric mean]] of the Cantor set is approximately 0.274974.<ref>http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1889476/cantor-set-geometric-mean</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Measure and probability===\nThe Cantor set can be seen as the [[compact group]] of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural [[Haar measure]]. When normalized so that the measure of the set is 1, it is a model of an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual [[Lebesgue measure]] on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a [[singular measure]]. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any [[probability]], making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.\n\nIn [[Lebesgue measure]] theory, the Cantor set is an example of a set which is uncountable and has zero measure.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://theoremoftheweek.wordpress.com/2010/09/30/theorem-36-the-cantor-set-is-an-uncountable-set-with-zero-measure/ | title=Theorem 36: the Cantor set is an uncountable set with zero measure | first=Laura | last=Irvine | website=Theorem of the week}}</ref>\n\n===Cantor numbers===\nIf we define a Cantor number as a member of the Cantor set, then<ref>{{cite book | title=Fractals, Chaos, Power Laws: Minutes from an Infinite Paradise  | first=Manfred | last=Schroeder | publisher=Dover | date=1991 | pages=164\u2013165 | isbn=0486472043}}</ref>\n*(1) Every real number in [0, 2] is the sum of two Cantor numbers.\n*(2) Between any two Cantor numbers there is a number that is not a Cantor number.\n\n== Variants ==\n\n===Smith&ndash;Volterra&ndash;Cantor set===\n{{main|Smith&ndash;Volterra&ndash;Cantor set}}\n\nInstead of repeatedly removing the middle third of every piece as in the Cantor set, we could also keep removing any other fixed percentage (other than 0% and 100%) from the middle.

Besides, to incorporate time we can divide only one of the available intervals at each step instead of dividing all the available intervals.

The cardinality of a [[finite set]] is a natural number: the number of elements in the set. The ''[[transfinite number|transfinite]]'' cardinal numbers describe the sizes of [[infinite set]]s.\n\nCardinality is defined in terms of [[bijective function]]s. Two sets have the same cardinality if, and only if, there is a one-to-one correspondence (bijection) between the elements of the two sets. In the case of finite sets, this agrees with the intuitive notion of size. In the case of infinite sets, the behavior is more complex. A fundamental theorem due to [[Georg Cantor]] shows that it is possible for infinite sets to have different cardinalities, and in particular the cardinality of the set of [[real number]]s is greater than the cardinality of the set of [[natural number]]s. It is also possible for a [[proper subset]] of an infinite set to have the same cardinality as the original set, something that cannot happen with proper subsets of finite sets.\n\nThere is a transfinite sequence of cardinal numbers:\n:<math>0, 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n, \\ldots ; \\aleph_0, \\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\ldots, \\aleph_{\\alpha}, \\ldots.\\ </math>\nThis sequence starts with the [[natural number]]s including zero (finite cardinals), which are followed by the [[aleph number]]s (infinite cardinals of [[well-ordering|well-ordered sets]]). The aleph numbers are indexed by [[ordinal number]]s.  Under the assumption of the [[axiom of choice]], this [[transfinite sequence]] includes every cardinal number.  If one [[axiom of choice#Independence|rejects]] that axiom, the situation is more complicated, with additional infinite cardinals that are not alephs.\n\n[[Cardinality]] is studied for its own sake as part of [[set theory]]. It is also a tool used in branches of mathematics including [[model theory]], [[combinatorics]], [[abstract algebra]], and [[mathematical analysis]]. In [[category theory]], the cardinal numbers form a [[Skeleton (category theory)|skeleton]] of the [[category of sets]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe notion of cardinality, as now understood, was formulated by [[Georg Cantor]], the originator of [[set theory]], in 1874\u20131884. Cardinality can be used to compare an aspect of finite sets; e.g. the sets {1,2,3} and {4,5,6} are not ''equal'', but have the ''same cardinality'', namely three (this is established by the existence of a [[bijection]], i.e. a one-to-one correspondence, between the two sets; e.g. {1\u21924, 2\u21925, 3\u21926}).\n\nCantor applied his concept of bijection to infinite sets;<ref>{{harvnb|Dauben|1990|loc=pg. 54}}</ref> e.g. the set of natural numbers '''N''' = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Thus, all sets having a bijection with '''N''' he called [[Countable set|denumerable (countably infinite) sets]] and they all have the same cardinal number. This cardinal number is called <math>\\aleph_0</math>, [[Aleph number|aleph-null]]. He called the cardinal numbers of these infinite sets [[transfinite cardinal numbers]].\n\nCantor proved that any [[Bounded set|unbounded subset]] of '''N''' has the same cardinality as '''N''', even though this might appear to run contrary to intuition. He also proved that the set of all [[ordered pair]]s of natural numbers is denumerable; this implies that the set of all [[rational number]]s is also denumerable, since every rational can be represented by a pair of integers. He later proved that the set of all real [[algebraic number]]s is also denumerable. Each real algebraic number ''z'' may be encoded as a finite sequence of integers which are the coefficients in the polynomial equation of which it is a solution, i.e. the ordered n-tuple (''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>''), ''a<sub>i</sub>'' \u2208 '''Z''' together with a pair of rationals (''b''<sub>0</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>) such that ''z'' is the unique root of the polynomial with coefficients (''a''<sub>0</sub>, ''a''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''a<sub>n</sub>'') that lies in the interval (''b''<sub>0</sub>, ''b''<sub>1</sub>).\n\nIn his 1874 paper \"[[On a Property of the Collection of All Real Algebraic Numbers]]\", Cantor proved that there exist higher-order cardinal numbers by showing that the set of real numbers has cardinality greater than that of '''N'''. His proof used an argument with [[nested intervals]], but in an 1891 paper he proved the same result using his ingenious but simpler [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]]. The new cardinal number of the set of real numbers is called the [[cardinality of the continuum]] and Cantor used the symbol <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math> for it.\n\nCantor also developed a large portion of the general theory of cardinal numbers; he proved that there is a smallest transfinite cardinal number (<math>\\aleph_0</math>, aleph-null), and that for every cardinal number there is a next-larger cardinal\n\n:<math>(\\aleph_1, \\aleph_2, \\aleph_3, \\ldots).</math>\n\nHis [[continuum hypothesis]] is the proposition that <math>\\mathfrak{c}</math> is the same as <math>\\aleph_1</math>. This hypothesis has been found to be independent of the standard axioms of mathematical set theory; it can neither be proved nor disproved from the standard assumptions.\n\n== Motivation ==\nIn informal use, a '''cardinal number''' is what is normally referred to as a ''[[counting number]]'', provided that 0 is included: 0, 1, 2, .... They may be identified with the [[natural numbers]] beginning with 0. The counting numbers are exactly what can be defined formally as the [[finite set|finite]] cardinal numbers.  Infinite cardinals only occur in higher-level mathematics and logic.\n\nMore formally, a non-zero number can be used for two purposes: to describe the size of a set, or to describe the position of an element in a sequence.  For finite sets and sequences it is easy to see that these two notions coincide, since for every number describing a position in a sequence we can construct a set which has exactly the right size, e.g. 3 describes the position of 'c' in the sequence <'a','b','c','d',...>, and we can construct the set {a,b,c} which has 3 elements.  However, when dealing with [[infinite set]]s it is essential to distinguish between the two \u2014 the two notions are in fact different for infinite sets. Considering the position aspect leads to [[ordinal numbers]], while the size aspect is generalized by the '''cardinal numbers''' described here.\n\nThe intuition behind the formal definition of cardinal is the construction of a notion of the relative size or \"bigness\" of a set without reference to the kind of members which it has.  For finite sets this is easy; one simply counts the number of elements a set has.  In order to compare the sizes of larger sets, it is necessary to appeal to more subtle notions.\n\nA set ''Y'' is at least as big as a set ''X'' if there is an [[injective function|injective]] [[map (mathematics)|mapping]] from the elements of ''X'' to the elements of ''Y''. An injective mapping identifies each element of the set ''X'' with a unique element of the set ''Y''. This is most easily understood by an example; suppose we have the sets ''X'' = {1,2,3} and ''Y'' = {a,b,c,d}, then using this notion of size we would observe that there is a mapping:\n: 1 \u2192 a\n: 2 \u2192 b\n: 3 \u2192 c\nwhich is injective, and hence conclude that ''Y'' has cardinality greater than or equal to ''X''. Note the element d has no element mapping to it, but this is permitted as we only require an injective mapping, and not necessarily an injective and [[onto]] mapping. The advantage of this notion is that it can be extended to infinite sets.\n\nWe can then extend this to an equality-style relation. Two [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] ''X'' and ''Y'' are said to have the same '''cardinality''' if there exists a [[bijection]] between ''X'' and ''Y''.  By the [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schroeder theorem|Schroeder\u2013Bernstein theorem]], this is equivalent to there being ''both'' an injective mapping from ''X'' to ''Y'' ''and'' an injective mapping from ''Y'' to ''X''. We then write |''X''| = |''Y''|. The cardinal number of ''X'' itself is often defined as the least ordinal ''a'' with |''a''| = |''X''|.  This is called the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]]; for this definition to make sense, it must be proved that every set has the same cardinality as ''some'' ordinal; this statement is the [[well-ordering principle]]. It is however possible to discuss the relative cardinality of sets without explicitly assigning names to objects.\n\nThe classic example used is that of the infinite hotel paradox, also called [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]].  Suppose you are an innkeeper at a hotel with an infinite number of rooms. The hotel is full, and then a new guest arrives.  It is possible to fit the extra guest in by asking the guest who was in room 1 to move to room 2, the guest in room 2 to move to room 3, and so on, leaving room 1 vacant.  We can explicitly write a segment of this mapping:\n: 1 \u2192 2\n: 2 \u2192 3\n: 3 \u2192 4\n: ...\n: ''n'' \u2192 ''n'' + 1\n: ...\nIn this way we can see that the set {1,2,3,...} has the same cardinality as the set {2,3,4,...} since a bijection between the first and the second has been shown.  This motivates the definition of an infinite set being any set which has a proper subset of the same cardinality; in this case {2,3,4,...} is a proper subset of {1,2,3,...}.\n\nWhen considering these large objects, we might also want to see if the notion of counting order coincides with that of cardinal defined above for these infinite sets.  It happens that it doesn't; by considering the above example we can see that if some object \"one greater than infinity\" exists, then it must have the same cardinality as the infinite set we started out with. It is possible to use a different formal notion for number, called [[Ordinal number|ordinals]], based on the ideas of counting and considering each number in turn, and we discover that the notions of cardinality and ordinality are divergent once we move out of the finite numbers.\n\nIt can be proved that the cardinality of the [[real number]]s is greater than that of the natural numbers just described.  This can be visualized using [[Cantor's diagonal argument]];\nclassic questions of cardinality (for instance the [[continuum hypothesis]]) are concerned with discovering whether there is some cardinal between some pair of other infinite cardinals.  In more recent times mathematicians have been describing the properties of larger and larger cardinals.\n\nSince cardinality is such a common concept in mathematics, a variety of names are in use.  Sameness of cardinality is sometimes referred to as '''equipotence''', '''equipollence''', or '''equinumerosity'''. It is thus said that two sets with the same cardinality are, respectively, '''equipotent''', '''equipollent''', or '''equinumerous'''.\n\n== Formal definition ==\nFormally, assuming the [[axiom of choice]], the cardinality of a set ''X'' is the least [[ordinal number]] \u03b1 such that there is a bijection between ''X'' and \u03b1.  This definition is known as the [[von Neumann cardinal assignment]].  If the axiom of choice is not assumed we need to do something different.  The oldest definition of the cardinality of a set ''X'' (implicit in Cantor and explicit in Frege and [[Principia Mathematica]]) is as the class ''[X]'' of all sets that are equinumerous with ''X''. This does not work in [[ZFC]] or other related systems of [[axiomatic set theory]] because if ''X'' is non-empty, this collection is too large to be a set. In fact, for ''X \u2260 \u2205'' there is an injection from the universe into ''[X]'' by mapping a set ''m'' to ''{m} \u00d7 X'' and so by the [[axiom of limitation of size]], ''[X]'' is a proper class. The definition does work however in [[type theory]] and in [[New Foundations]] and related systems.  However, if we restrict from this class to those equinumerous with ''X'' that have the least [[rank (set theory)|rank]], then it will work (this is a trick due to [[Dana Scott]]:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Deiser|first1=Oliver|title=On the Development of the Notion of a Cardinal Number|journal=History and Philosophy of Logic|doi=10.1080/01445340903545904 |volume=31|issue=2|pages=123\u2013143|date=May 2010}}</ref>  it works because the collection of objects with any given rank is a set).\n\nFormally, the order among cardinal numbers is defined as follows: |''X''| \u2264 |''Y''| means that there exists an [[injective]] function from ''X'' to ''Y''.

The [[finite set|finite]] cardinals are just the [[natural numbers]], i.e., a set ''X'' is finite if and only if |''X''| = |''n''| = ''n'' for some natural number ''n''.  Any other set is [[infinite set|infinite]].  Assuming the axiom of choice, it can be proved that the Dedekind notions correspond to the standard ones. It can also be proved that the cardinal <math>\\aleph_0</math> ([[aleph null]] or aleph-0, where aleph is the first letter in the [[Hebrew alphabet]], represented <math>\\aleph</math>) of the set of natural numbers is the smallest infinite cardinal, i.e. that any infinite set has a subset of cardinality <math>\\aleph_0.</math>  The next larger cardinal is denoted by <math>\\aleph_1</math> and so on. For every [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] \u03b1 there is a cardinal number <math>\\aleph_{\\alpha},</math> and this list exhausts all infinite cardinal numbers.\n\n== Cardinal arithmetic ==\nWe can define [[arithmetic]] operations on cardinal numbers that generalize the ordinary operations for natural numbers.  It can be shown that for finite cardinals these operations coincide with the usual operations for natural numbers. Furthermore, these operations share many properties with ordinary arithmetic.\n\n=== Successor cardinal ===\n{{Details|Successor cardinal}}\n\nIf the axiom of choice holds, then every cardinal \u03ba has a successor \u03ba<sup>+</sup> > \u03ba, and there are no cardinals between \u03ba and its successor.  (Without the axiom of choice, using [[Hartogs number|Hartogs' theorem]], it can be shown that, for any cardinal number \u03ba, there is a minimal cardinal \u03ba<sup>+</sup>, such that <!-- \u03ba<sup>+</sup> \u08de \u03ba.<ref group=notes>The symbol is the [[Unicode]] symbol for not less than or equal to.</ref>--><math>\\kappa^+\\nleq\\kappa. </math>)  For finite cardinals, the successor is simply \u03ba + 1.  For infinite cardinals, the successor cardinal differs from the [[successor ordinal]].\n\n=== Cardinal addition ===\nIf ''X'' and ''Y'' are [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]], addition is given by the [[union (set theory)|union]] of ''X'' and ''Y''.  If the two sets are not already disjoint, then they can be replaced by disjoint sets of the same cardinality, e.g., replace ''X'' by ''X''\u00d7{0} and ''Y'' by ''Y''\u00d7{1}.\n:<math>|X| + |Y| = | X \\cup Y|.</math>\n\nZero is an additive identity ''\u03ba'' + 0 = 0 + ''\u03ba'' = ''\u03ba''.\n\nAddition is [[associative]] (''\u03ba'' + ''\u03bc'') + ''\u03bd'' = ''\u03ba'' + (''\u03bc'' + ''\u03bd'').\n\nAddition is [[commutative]] ''\u03ba'' + ''\u03bc'' = ''\u03bc'' + ''\u03ba''.\n\nAddition is non-decreasing in both arguments:\n:<math>(\\kappa \\le \\mu) \\rightarrow ((\\kappa + \\nu \\le \\mu + \\nu) \\mbox{ and } (\\nu + \\kappa \\le \\nu + \\mu)).</math>\n\nAssuming the axiom of choice, addition of infinite cardinal numbers is easy.

This proves that no largest cardinal exists (because for any cardinal ''\u03ba'', we can always find a larger cardinal 2<sup>\u03ba</sup>). In fact, the [[class (set theory)|class]] of cardinals is a [[proper class]].  (This proof fails in some set theories, notably [[New Foundations]].)\n\nAll the remaining propositions in this section assume the axiom of choice:\n\n:If ''\u03ba'' and ''\u03bc'' are both finite and greater than 1, and ''\u03bd'' is infinite, then ''\u03ba''<sup>''\u03bd''</sup> = ''\u03bc''<sup>''\u03bd''</sup>.\n:If ''\u03ba'' is infinite and ''\u03bc'' is finite and non-zero, then ''\u03ba''<sup>''\u03bc''</sup> = ''\u03ba''.\n\nIf 2 \u2264 \u03ba and 1 \u2264 \u03bc and at least one of them is infinite, then:\n:Max (\u03ba, 2<sup>\u03bc</sup>) \u2264 \u03ba<sup>\u03bc</sup> \u2264 Max (2<sup>\u03ba</sup>, 2<sup>\u03bc</sup>).\n\nUsing [[K\u00f6nig's theorem (set theory)|K\u00f6nig's theorem]], one can prove \u03ba < \u03ba<sup>cf(\u03ba)</sup> and \u03ba < cf(2<sup>\u03ba</sup>) for any infinite cardinal \u03ba, where cf(\u03ba) is the [[cofinality]] of \u03ba.\n\n==== Roots ====\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \u03ba and a finite cardinal \u03bc greater than 0, the cardinal \u03bd satisfying <math>\\nu^\\mu = \\kappa</math> will be \u03ba.\n\n==== Logarithms ====\nAssuming the axiom of choice and, given an infinite cardinal \u03ba and a finite cardinal \u03bc greater than 1, there may or may not be a cardinal \u03bb satisfying <math>\\mu^\\lambda = \\kappa</math>.

Logarithms of infinite cardinals are useful in some fields of mathematics, for example in the study of [[cardinal invariant]]s of [[topological space]]s, though they lack some of the properties that logarithms of positive real numbers possess.<ref>Robert A.

That is, the \"cardinality\" of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.\n\nThe relation of having the same cardinality is called [[equinumerosity]], and this is an [[equivalence relation]] on the [[class (set theory)|class]] of all sets. The [[equivalence class]] of a set ''A'' under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as ''A''. There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\":\n\n#The cardinality of a set ''A'' is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity.\n#A representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the [[Von Neumann cardinal assignment|initial ordinal in that class]]. This is usually taken as the definition of [[cardinal number]] in [[axiomatic set theory]].\n\nAssuming [[Axiom of choice|AC]], the cardinalities of the [[infinite set]]s are denoted\n:<math>\\aleph_0 < \\aleph_1 < \\aleph_2 < \\ldots . </math>\nFor each [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] <math>\\alpha</math>, <math>\\aleph_{\\alpha + 1}</math> is the least cardinal number greater than <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math>.\n\nThe cardinality of the [[natural number]]s is denoted [[aleph number|aleph-null]] (<math>\\aleph_0</math>), while the cardinality of the [[real number]]s is denoted by \"<math>\\mathfrak c</math>\" (a lowercase [[fraktur (script)|fraktur script]] \"c\"), and is also referred to as the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Cantor showed, using the [[Cantor's diagonal argument|diagonal argument]], that <math>{\\mathfrak c} >\\aleph_0</math>. We can show that <math>\\mathfrak c = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>, this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The [[continuum hypothesis]] says that <math>\\aleph_1 = 2^{\\aleph_0}</math>, i.e. <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> is the smallest cardinal number bigger than <math>\\aleph_0</math>, i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers.\nThe continuum hypothesis is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice|ZFC]], a standard axiomatization of set theory; that is, it is impossible to prove the continuum hypothesis or its negation from ZFC (provided ZFC is consistent).

Thus we can make the following definitions:\n\n*Any set ''X'' with cardinality less than that of the [[natural number]]s, or |\u2009''X''\u2009| < |\u2009'''N'''\u2009|, is said to be a [[finite set]].\n*Any set ''X'' that has the same cardinality as the set of the natural numbers, or |\u2009''X''\u2009| = |\u2009'''N'''\u2009| = <math>\\aleph_0</math>, is said to be a [[countably infinite]] set.\n*Any set ''X'' with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers, or |\u2009''X''\u2009| > |\u2009'''N'''\u2009|, for example |\u2009'''R'''\u2009| = <math>\\mathfrak c </math> > |\u2009'''N'''\u2009|, is said to be  [[uncountable set|uncountable]].\n\n==Infinite sets==\nOur intuition gained from [[finite set]]s breaks down when dealing with [[infinite set]]s. In the late nineteenth century [[Georg Cantor]], [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Richard Dedekind]] and others rejected the view that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]].\nIndeed, Dedekind defined an infinite set as one that can be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with a strict subset (that is, having the same size in Cantor's sense); this notion of infinity is called [[Dedekind infinite]]. Cantor introduced the cardinal numbers, and showed that (according to his bijection-based definition of size) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers (<math>\\aleph_0</math>).\n\n===Cardinality of the continuum===\n{{main article|Cardinality of the continuum}}\n\nOne of Cantor's most important results was that the [[cardinality of the continuum]] (<math>\\mathfrak{c}</math>) is greater than that of the natural numbers (<math>\\aleph_0</math>); that is, there are more real numbers '''R''' than whole numbers '''N'''. Namely, Cantor showed that <math>\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\beth_1</math> (see [[Beth number#Beth one|Beth one]]) satisfies:\n:<math>2^{\\aleph_0} > \\aleph_0</math>\n:(see [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] or [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]]).\n\nThe [[continuum hypothesis]] states that there is no [[cardinal number]] between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,\n:<math>2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1</math>\n\nHowever, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted [[ZFC]] [[axiomatic set theory]], if ZFC is consistent.\n\nCardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a [[real number line]] is equal to the number of points in any [[line segment|segment]] of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist [[proper subset]]s and [[proper superset]]s of an infinite set ''S'' that have the same size as ''S'', although ''S'' contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of ''S'' contain elements that are not included in it.\n\nThe first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the [[tangent function]], which provides a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between the [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] (\u2212\u00bd\u03c0, \u00bd\u03c0) and '''R''' (see also [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]]).\n\nThe second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when [[Giuseppe Peano]] introduced the [[space-filling curve]]s, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or [[hypercube]], or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be used to obtain [[Space-filling curve#Proof that a square and its side contain the same number of points|such a proof]].\n\nCantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than <math>\\mathfrak c</math> exist (see his [[Cantor's diagonal argument#General sets|generalized diagonal argument]] and [[Cantor's theorem|theorem]]). They include, for instance:\n\n:* the set of all subsets of '''R''', i.e., the [[power set]] of '''R''', written ''P''('''R''') or 2<sup>'''R'''</sup>\n:* the set '''R'''<sup>'''R'''</sup> of all functions from '''R''' to '''R'''\n\nBoth have cardinality\n:<math>2^\\mathfrak {c} = \\beth_2 > \\mathfrak c </math>\n:(see [[Beth number#Beth two|Beth two]]).\n\nThe [[Cardinality of the continuum#Cardinal equalities|cardinal equalities]] <math>\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\mathfrak{c},</math> <math>\\mathfrak c^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak c,</math> and <math>\\mathfrak c ^{\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\mathfrak c}</math> can be demonstrated using [[cardinal arithmetic]]:\n:<math>\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\left(2^{\\aleph_0}\\right)^2 = 2^{2\\times{\\aleph_0}} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c},</math>\n:<math>\\mathfrak c^{\\aleph_0} = \\left(2^{\\aleph_0}\\right)^{\\aleph_0} = 2^{{\\aleph_0}\\times{\\aleph_0}} = 2^{\\aleph_0} = \\mathfrak{c},</math>\n:<math> \\mathfrak c ^{\\mathfrak c} = \\left(2^{\\aleph_0}\\right)^{\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\mathfrak c\\times\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\mathfrak c}.</math>\n\n==Examples and properties==\n* If ''X'' = {''a'', ''b'', ''c''} and ''Y'' = {apples, oranges, peaches}, then |\u2009''X''\u2009| = |\u2009''Y''\u2009| because { (''a'', apples), (''b'', oranges), (''c'', peaches)} is a bijection between the sets ''X'' and ''Y''. The cardinality of each of ''X'' and ''Y'' is 3.\n* If |\u2009''X''\u2009| &lt; |\u2009''Y''\u2009|, then there exists ''Z'' such that |\u2009''X''\u2009| = |\u2009''Z''\u2009| and ''Z'' \u2286 ''Y''.\n*If |\u2009''X''\u2009| \u2264 |\u2009''Y''\u2009| and |\u2009''Y''\u2009| \u2264 |\u2009''X''\u2009|, then |\u2009''X''\u2009| = |\u2009''Y''\u2009|. This holds even for infinite cardinals, and is known as [[Cantor\u2013Bernstein\u2013Schroeder theorem]].\n* [[Cardinality of the continuum#Sets with cardinality of the continuum|Sets with cardinality of the continuum]]\n\n==Union and intersection==\n\nIf ''A'' and ''B'' are ''disjoint'' sets, then\n:<math>\\left\\vert A \\cup B \\right\\vert = \\left\\vert A \\right\\vert + \\left\\vert B \\right\\vert.</math>\n\nFrom this, one can show that in general the cardinalities of [[Union (set theory)|unions]] and  [[Intersection (set theory)|intersections]] are related by<ref>Applied Abstract Algebra, K.H.

Changes in the theater rendered DeMille's melodramas obsolete before they were produced, and true theatrical success eluded him. By 1913 he was having difficulty supporting his wife and baby daughter.\n\n===Moving pictures===\nIn July 1913 DeMille, Jesse Lasky, Sam Goldfish (later [[Samuel Goldwyn]]), and a group of East Coast businessmen created the Jesse L. Lasky Feature Play Company. On December 12, 1913, DeMille, his cast, and crew boarded a Southern Pacific train bound for Flagstaff via New Orleans. His tentative plan was to shoot a film in Arizona, but he disliked the quality of light he saw there.<ref>Presley, ''Cecil B. DeMille;;, p. 29.</ref> He continued to Los Angeles. Once there, he chose not to shoot in [[Edendale, Los Angeles|Edendale]], where many studios were, but in Hollywood. He also flouted the dictum that a film should run twenty minutes. He made his first film run sixty minutes, as long as a short play. ''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914), co-directed by [[Oscar Apfel]], was a sensation and it established the Lasky Company.\n\n===Silent era===\n[[File:Cecil B. DeMille 1919.jpg|200px|thumb|Advertisement (1919)]]\nThe first few years of the Lasky Company (soon to become [[Famous Players-Lasky]]) were spent in making films nonstop, literally writing the language of film. DeMille adapted Belasco's dramatic lighting techniques to film technology, mimicking moonlight with U.S. cinema's first attempts at \"motivated lighting\" in ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (1915 film)|The Warrens of Virginia]]''.<ref name=\"Presley, p. 47\"/>\n\nAfter five years and thirty hit films, DeMille became the American film industry's most successful director. In the silent era, he was renowned for ''[[Male and Female]]'' (1919), ''[[Manslaughter (1922 film)|Manslaughter]]'' (1921), ''[[The Volga Boatman (film)|The Volga Boatman]]'' (1926), and ''[[The Godless Girl]]'' (1928). DeMille's trademark scenes included bathtubs, lion attacks, and Roman orgies. A number of his films featured scenes in two-color [[Technicolor]].\n\nThe immense popularity of DeMille's silent films enabled him to branch out into other areas. The Roaring Twenties were the boom years and DeMille took full advantage, opening the Mercury Aviation Company, one of America's first commercial airlines. He was also a real estate speculator, an underwriter of political campaigns, and a Bank of America executive, approving loans for other filmmakers.\n\n===Sound era===\nWhen \"talking pictures\" were innovated in 1928, DeMille made a successful transition, offering his own innovations to the painful process; he devised a microphone boom and a soundproof camera blimp. He also popularized the camera crane.\n\nDeMille made stars of unknown actors: [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Bebe Daniels]], [[Rod La Rocque]], [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]], [[Claudette Colbert]], and [[Charlton Heston]]. He also cast established stars such as [[Gary Cooper]], [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], [[Paulette Goddard]] and [[Fredric March]] in multiple pictures. DeMille displayed a loyalty to his performers, casting them repeatedly. They included [[Henry Wilcoxon]], [[Julia Faye]], [[Joseph Schildkraut]], [[Ian Keith]], [[Charles Bickford]], [[Theodore Roberts]], [[Akim Tamiroff]] and [[William Boyd (actor)|William Boyd]]. DeMille was credited by actor [[Edward G. Robinson]] with saving his career following his eclipse in the [[Hollywood blacklist]].<ref>Presley, ''Cecil B. DeMille'', p. 375.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cecil b de mille directing.png|left|240px|thumb|DeMille directing, 1920]]\nDeMille had a reputation for autocratic behavior on the set, singling out and berating extras who were not paying attention. A number of these displays were thought to be staged, however, as an exercise in discipline.<ref>Presley, \"Cecil B. DeMille\", p. 259.</ref> He despised actors who were unwilling to take physical risks, especially when he had first demonstrated that the required stunt would not harm them. This occurred with [[Victor Mature]] in ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]''. Mature refused to wrestle Jackie the Lion, even though DeMille had just tussled with the lion, proving that he was tame. DeMille told the actor that he was \"one hundred percent yellow\".<ref>Presley, ''Cecil B. DeMille'', p. 344.</ref> [[Paulette Goddard]]'s refusal to risk personal injury in a scene involving fire in ''[[Unconquered]]'' cost her DeMille's favor and a role in ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]''.<ref>Presley, ''Cecil B. DeMille'', p. 363.</ref>\n\nDeMille was adept at directing \"thousands of extras\", and many of his pictures include spectacular setpieces: the toppling of the [[Paganism|pagan]] temple in ''[[Samson and Delilah (1949 film)|Samson and Delilah]]''; train wrecks in ''[[The Road to Yesterday]]'', ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'' and ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]''; the destruction of an airship in ''[[Madam Satan]]''; and the parting of the [[Red Sea]] in both versions of ''The Ten Commandments''.\n\nDeMille first used three-strip [[Technicolor]] in ''[[North West Mounted Police (film)|North West Mounted Police]]'' (1940). Audiences liked its highly saturated color, so DeMille made no further black-and-white features.\n\n===Showmanship as director===\n[[File:Cecil B DeMille 1937.JPG|thumb|DeMille as producer of the CBS Radio Theatre, 1937]]\nDeMille was one of the first directors to become a celebrity in his own right. He cultivated the image of the omnipotent director, complete with [[megaphone]], [[riding crop]], and [[jodhpurs]]. From 1936 to 1944, DeMille hosted ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]'', a weekly digest of current feature films.\n\nDeMille was respected by his peers, yet his individual films were sometimes criticized. \"Directorially, I think his pictures were the most horrible things I've ever seen in my life\", said director [[William Wellman]]. \"But he put on pictures that made a fortune. In that respect, he was better than any of us.\"<ref>Brownlow, K. (1976). ''The Parade's Gone by...'' Berkeley, California: University of California Press. p. 185. {{ISBN|978-0-520-03068-8}}.</ref> \nProducer [[David O. Selznick]] wrote: \"There has appeared only one Cecil B. DeMille. He is one of the most extraordinarily able showmen of modern times. However much I may dislike some of his pictures, it would be very silly of me, as a producer of commercial motion pictures, to demean for an instant his unparalleled skill as a maker of mass entertainment.\"<ref>Presley, ''Cecil B. DeMille'', p. 357.</ref>\n\nDeMille appeared as himself in numerous films, including the M-G-M comedy ''[[Free and Easy (1930 film)|Free and Easy]].'' He often appeared in his coming-attraction trailers and narrated many of his later films, even stepping on screen to introduce ''The Ten Commandments''. DeMille was immortalized in [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Sunset Boulevard (film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' when [[Gloria Swanson]] spoke the line: \"All right, Mr. DeMille. I'm ready for my closeup.\" DeMille plays himself in the film.\n\nIn the 1940s, DeMille continued to please the public. He averaged one film a year; most of them centered on historical figures or Bible stories. His first attempt at a drama set within a semi-documentary frame was ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (film)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', a saga of circus performers released in 1952. His experiment gained him a nomination for best director and won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for Best Picture that year.\n\n===''The Ten Commandments''===\nIn 1954, DeMille began his last film, the production for which he is best remembered, ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]''.\n\nOn November 7, 1954, while in Egypt filming the [[The Exodus|Exodus]] sequence for ''The Ten Commandments'', DeMille (who was seventy-three) climbed a {{convert|107|ft|adj=on}} ladder to the top of the massive Per Rameses set and suffered a serious heart attack. Ignoring his doctor's orders, DeMille was back directing the film within a week.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/dvd/2011-04-01-dvdextra-ten-commandments_N.htm|title=DVD extra: 'Ten Commandments' gets HD treatment|last=Jones|first=Steve|date=April 1, 2011|publisher=usatoday.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref> Although DeMille completed the film, his health was diminished by several more heart attacks. This film would be his last.\n\n===Unfulfilled projects===\nBecause of his illness, DeMille asked his son-in-law, actor [[Anthony Quinn]], to direct a remake of his 1938 film ''[[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|The Buccaneer]]''. DeMille served as executive producer. Despite a cast led by [[Charlton Heston]] and [[Yul Brynner]], the 1958 film ''[[The Buccaneer (1958 film)|The Buccaneer]]'' was a disappointment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/188862%7C0/The-Buccaneer.html|title=The Buccaneer (1958)|website=Turner Classic Movies|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\nIn the months before his death, DeMille was researching a film biography of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell]], the founder of the [[Scouting|Scout Movement]]. DeMille asked [[David Niven]] to star in the film, but it was never made. DeMille also was planning a film about the space race as well as another Biblical epic about the [[Book of Revelation]].<ref>Eyman, Scott. ''Empire of Dreams: The Epic Life of Cecil B. DeMille''.

The couple also adopted an orphan child, [[Katherine DeMille|Katherine Lester]], in the early 1920s; her father had been killed in [[World War I]] and her mother had died of [[tuberculosis]].\n\nKatherine became an actress at Paramount Pictures, ultimately gaining his approval. In 1937 she married actor [[Anthony Quinn]]. In the 1920s the DeMilles adopted two sons, John and [[Richard de Mille|Richard]], the latter of whom became a notable filmmaker, writer, and psychologist.\n\nDeMille was a Freemason and a member of Prince of Orange Lodge #16 in New York City.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |publisher=MWGLNY |title=Famous Masons |date=January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110010123/http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nCecil had an older brother William, and a sister Agnes who died in childhood. William later named a daughter after her, [[Agnes de Mille]], the famed dancer-choreographer.\n\n==Politics==\nDeMille was a lifelong conservative [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] activist. He greatly admired [[Herbert Hoover]]. In [[U.S. presidential election, 1944|1944]], he was the [[master of ceremonies]] at the massive rally organized by [[David O. Selznick]] in the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]] in support of the [[Thomas E. Dewey|Dewey]]-[[John W. Bricker|Bricker]] ticket as well as [[governor of California|Governor]] [[Earl Warren]] of California, who would become Dewey's running mate in 1948 and later the [[Chief Justice of the United States]]. The gathering drew 93,000, with short speeches by [[Hedda Hopper]] and [[Walt Disney]]. Among those in attendance were [[Ann Sothern]], [[Ginger Rogers]], [[Randolph Scott]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Gary Cooper]], and [[Walter Pidgeon]]. Though the rally drew a good response, most Hollywood celebrities who took a public position sided with the [[Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]-[[Harry Truman|Truman]] ticket.<ref name=\"David M. Jordan 2011 pp. 231-232\">David M. Jordan, ''FDR, Dewey, and the Election of 1944'' (Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 2011), pp. 231\u2013232.</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Secretary of the Air Force [[Harold E. Talbott]] asked DeMille for help in designing the cadet uniforms at the newly established [[United States Air Force Academy]]. DeMille's designs, most notably his design of the distinctive cadet parade uniform, won praise from Air Force and Academy leadership, were ultimately adopted, and are still worn by cadets.<ref>Radford, Bill. \"A Digger, A Director and A Practical Joker\". ''Colorado Springs Gazette'', USAF Academy 50th Anniversary Edition, Spring 2004.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s, DeMille was recruited by [[Allen Dulles]] and [[Frank Wisner]] to serve on the board of the [[anti-communist]] [[National Committee for a Free Europe]], the public face of the organization that oversaw the [[Radio Free Europe]] service.<ref>Weiner, Tim (2007). ''Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA''. New York: Doubleday. p. 36. {{ISBN|978-0-3855-1445-3}}</ref>\n\n==Race and religion==\nDeMille drew on his Christian and Jewish heritage to convey a message of tolerance. ''[[The Crusades (film)|The Crusades]]'' was the first film to show accord between Christians and Muslims. DeMille received more than a dozen awards from Jewish religious and cultural groups, including [[B\u2019nai B\u2019rith]].\n\nIn 1954, he was seeking approval for a lavish remake of his 1923 silent film ''The Ten Commandments''. He went before the Paramount board of directors, which was mostly Jewish-American. The members rejected his proposal, even though his last two films, ''Samson and Delilah'' and ''The Greatest Show on Earth'', had been record-breaking hits. Adolph Zukor, the chairman of the board, rebuked the members, saying:\n\n<blockquote>We have just lived through a war where our people were systematically executed. Here we have a man who made a film praising the Jewish people, that tells of Samson, one of the legends of our Scripture. Now he wants to make the life of Moses. We should get down on our knees to Cecil and say \"Thank you!\"</blockquote>\n\nDeMille did not have an exact budget proposal for the project, and it promised to be the most costly in U.S. film history. Still, the members unanimously approved it.<ref>Presley, ''Cecil B. DeMille'', p. 371.</ref>\n\n==Death==\nIn the early hours of January 21, 1959, DeMille died of a [[heart ailment]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0812.html|title=Cecil De Mille, 77, Pioneer of Movies, Dead in Hollywood|date=January 22, 1959|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDeMille's funeral was held on January 23 at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church. He was entombed at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery|Hollywood Memorial Cemetery]] (now known as Hollywood Forever).<ref>Donnelley, Paul (2004).

The first, for radio contributions, is located at 6240 Hollywood Blvd. The second star is located at 1725 Vine Street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/cecil-b-demille/|title=Hollywood Star Walk: Cecil B.

DeMille Middle School, in [[Long Beach, California]], closed and demolished in 2007 to make way for a new high school; and Cecil B. DeMille Elementary School in [[Midway City, California]].\n\nThe former film building at [[Chapman University]] in [[Orange, California]] is named in honor of DeMille. The [[Lawrence and Kristina Dodge College of Film and Media Arts]] now resides in Marion Knotts Studios.\n\nThe [[Golden Globe]]'s annual [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]] recognizes lifetime achievement in the film industry.\n\nThe moving image collection of Cecil B. DeMille is held at the Academy Film Archive and includes home movies, outtakes, and [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6EnMrahqbA&index=20&list=PLJ8RjvesnvDMirffrNEsCKnSFlIMwJoei never-before-seen test footage].<ref>{{cite web|title=Cecil B.

DeAldrin\", as a humorous nod to DeMille.<ref>{{cite web|title=Apollo 11-Technical Air to Ground Voice Transcription|url=https://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a11/a11transcript_tec.html|website=Nasa Lunar Surface Journal}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\nDeMille made seventy features. In spite of careful storage in his film vaults, seven films&mdash;the early silents: ''[[The Arab (1915 film)|The Arab]]'', ''[[The Wild Goose Chase (film)|The Wild Goose Chase]]'', ''[[Chimmie Fadden]]'', ''[[The Dream Girl (film)|The Dream Girl]]'', ''[[We Can't Have Everything]]'', ''[[The Devil Stone]]'', and the 1918 remake ''[[The Squaw Man (1918 film)|The Squaw Man]]''&mdash;were lost to nitrate decomposition. Roughly twenty of his silent features are available in commercial DVD format.\n\nThe sound films are in three groups:\n\n1. The three films DeMille produced at [[M-G-M]] are now owned by [[Warner Bros.]] (through [[Turner Entertainment]]).\n\n2. The films he made at Paramount between 1932 and 1947 were sold by that company to [[EMKA, Ltd.]] in 1957, and are available through the [[Universal Television|television division]] of [[NBCUniversal]].\n\n3. DeMille's last three films were not sold to EMKA, and at present remain with Paramount. Television distribution for those films is handled by [[Trifecta Entertainment & Media]]. ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' is broadcast every Easter Sunday in the United States on the [[ABC Television Network]].\n\n===Director===\n'''Silent films'''\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*''[[The Squaw Man (1914 film)|The Squaw Man]]'' (1914)\n*''[[Brewster's Millions (1914 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1914, Lost)\n*''[[The Master Mind]]'' (1914)\n*''[[The Only Son (1914 film)|The Only Son]]'' (1914, Lost)\n*''[[The Man on the Box]]'' (1914)\n*''[[The Call of the North (1914 film)|The Call of the North]]'' (1914)\n*''[[The Virginian (1914 film)|The Virginian]]'' (1914)\n*''[[What's His Name]]'' (1914)\n*''[[The Man from Home (1914 film)|The Man from Home]]'' (1914)\n*''[[Rose of the Rancho]]'' (1914)\n*''[[The Ghost Breaker (1914 film)|The Ghost Breaker]]'' (1914, Lost)\n*''[[The Girl of the Golden West (1915 film)|The Girl of the Golden West]]'' (1915)\n*''[[After Five]]'' (1915)\n*''[[The Warrens of Virginia (1915 film)|The Warrens of Virginia]]'' (1915)\n*''[[The Unafraid]]'' (1915)\n*''[[The Captive (1915 film)|The Captive]]'' (1915)\n*''[[The Wild Goose Chase (film)|The Wild Goose Chase]]'' (1915, Lost)\n*''[[The Arab (1915 film)|The Arab]]'' (1915, Lost)\n*''[[Chimmie Fadden]]'' (1915)\n*''[[Kindling (film)|Kindling]]'' (1915)\n*''[[Carmen (1915 Cecil B.

Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine originated in [[China proper]]. It is heavily influenced by [[Beijing cuisine]], with nearly all cooking methods identical, and differs only in material due to religious restrictions. As a result, northern Islamic cuisine is often included in home Beijing cuisine though seldom in east coast restaurants.\n\nDuring the [[Yuan dynasty]], [[halal]] methods of slaughtering animals and preparing food was banned and forbidden by the Mongol emperors, starting with [[Genghis Khan]] who banned Muslims and Jews from slaughtering their animals their own way and made them follow the Mongol method.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&pg=PA24&dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&q=chinggis%20khan%20forbidden%20halal&f=false|title=China's Muslim Hui community: migration, settlement and sects|author=Michael Dillon|year=1999|publisher=Curzon Press|location=Richmond|page=24|isbn=0-7007-1026-4|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N7_4Gr9Q438C&pg=PA230&dq=yuan+dynasty+halal&q=yuan+dynasty+halal#v=onepage&q=%20halal%20chinggis%20khan%20you%20are%20our%20slaves%20&f=false|title=Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road|author=Johan Elverskog|year=2010|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|edition=illustrated|location=|page=228|isbn=0-8122-4237-8|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nAmong all the [subject] alien peoples only the Hui-hui say \u201cwe do not eat Mongol food\u201d.

How can this be right?\u201d He thereupon made them eat. \u201cIf you slaughter sheep, you will be considered guilty of a crime.\u201d He issued a regulation to that effect ... [In 1279/1280 under [[Kublai Khan|Qubilai]]] all the Muslims say: \u201cif someone else slaughters [the animal] we do not eat\u201d. Because the poor people are upset by this, from now on, Musuluman [Muslim] Huihui and Zhuhu [Jewish] Huihui, no matter who kills [the animal] will eat [it] and must cease slaughtering sheep themselves, and cease the rite of circumcision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |title=The Integration of Religious Minorities in China: The Case of Chinese Muslims |author=Donald Daniel Leslie |year=1998 |page=12 |publisher=The Fifty-ninth George Ernest Morrison Lecture in Ethnology |accessdate=30 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217112014/http://islamicpopulation.com/asia/China/China_integration%20of%20religious%20minority.pdf |archivedate=17 December 2010 |df= }}.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nTraditionally, there is a distinction between northern and southern Chinese Islamic cuisine despite both using [[mutton]] and lamb. Northern Chinese Islamic cuisine relies heavily on beef, but rarely ducks, geese, shrimp or seafood, while southern Islamic cuisine is the reverse. The reason for this difference is due to availability of the ingredients. Oxen have been long used for farming and Chinese governments have frequently strictly prohibited the slaughter of oxen for food. However, due to the geographic proximity of the northern part of China to minority-dominated regions that were not subjected to such restrictions, beef could be easily purchased and transported to northern China. At the same time, ducks, geese, and shrimp are rare in comparison to southern China due to the arid climate of northern China.\n\n[[File:Muslim meat shop halal sign, Hankow China, 1935.jpg|thumb|left|A halal meat store sign in Hankou, ca. 1934-1935.]]\n[[File:Hongchangxing Islamic Fastfood in Expo2010.jpg|thumb|left|An Islamic fast food restaurant in Shanghai Expo]]\n\nA Chinese Islamic restaurant ({{zh|c=\u6e05\u771f\u83dc\u9928|p=q\u012bngzh\u0113n c\u00e0igu\u01cen}}) can be similar to a [[Mandarin cuisine|Mandarin restaurant]] with the exception that there is no [[pork]] on the menu and is{{clarify|date=February 2015}} primarily noodle/soup based.\n\nIn most major eastern cities in China, there are very limited Islamic/Halal restaurants, which are typically run by migrants from Western China (e.g., [[Uyghur people|Uyghurs]]). They primarily offer inexpensive noodle soups only. These restaurants are typically decorated with Islamic motifs such as pictures of Islamic [[Carpet|rug]]s and Arabic writing.\n\nAnother difference is that [[domestic sheep|lamb]] and [[Lamb (food)|mutton]] dishes are more commonly available than in other Chinese restaurants, due to the greater prevalence of these meats in the cuisine of western Chinese regions. ([[Chinese Islamic cuisine#Image gallery|Refer to image 1]].)\n\nOther Muslim ethnic minorities like the [[Salar people|Salar]], [[Dongxiang people|Dongxiang]], [[Bonan people|Bonan]], and [[Tibetan Muslims]] have their own cuisines as well. Dongxiang people operate their own restaurants serving their cuisine.\n\nMany cafeterias (canteens) at Chinese universities have separate sections or dining areas for Muslim students (Hui or western Chinese minorities), typically labeled \"qingzhen.\" Student ID cards sometimes indicate whether a student is Muslim and will allow access to these dining areas or will allow access on special occasions such as the [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] feast following [[Ramadan]].\n\nSeveral Hui restaurants serving Chinese Islamic cuisine exist in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbZuVatiFIUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=dru+c+gladney#v=snippet&q=los%20angeles%20restaurants&f=false|title=Dislocating China: reflections on Muslims, minorities, and other subaltern subjects|author=Dru C.

It was created by the Hui people during the [[Tang Dynasty]] of [[China]].\n\nIn the west, this food may be served in a small portion as a soup. In China, a large bowl of it is often taken as a whole meal with or without any side dish.\n\n===Chuanr===\n{{main|Chuan (food)}}\n'''Chuanr''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]] :\u4e32\u513f \u0427\u045e\u0430\u043d\u0440, [[pinyin]]: chu\u00e0nr (shortened from \"chuan er\"); ''\"kebab\"''), originating in the [[Xinjiang]] (\u65b0\u7586) province of China and in recent years has been disseminated throughout the rest of that country, most notably in [[Beijing]]. It is a product of the Chinese Islamic cuisine of the [[Uyghur people|Uyghur]] (\u7ef4\u543e\u5c14) people and other [[Islam in China|Chinese Muslims]]. Yang rou chuan, or lamb kebabs, is particularly popular.\n\n===Suan cai===\n{{main|Suan cai}}\nSuan cai is a traditional fermented vegetable dish, similar to Korean [[kimchi]] and German [[sauerkraut]], used in a variety of ways. It consists of pickled Chinese cabbage. Suan cai is a unique form of pao cai due to the material used and the method of production. Although ''suan cai'' is not exclusive to Chinese Islamic cuisine, it is used in Chinese Islamic cuisine to top off noodle soups, especially [[beef noodle soup]].\n\n===Nang===\n''Nang'' \u9995 \u041d\u04d9\u04a3, is a type of round unleavened bread, topped with sesame. It is similar to South and Central Asia [[naan]].\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\" caption=\"\" widths=\"210px\" heights=\"210px\"> \nImage:Niuroumian.jpg|Lanzhou-style Beef Lamian\nImage:beef noodle.JPG|Beef noodle served\nFile:Peking Duck.jpg|[[Peking Duck]] served at a halal restaurant in Beijing\nImage:5658-Linxia-City-niang-pi.jpg|''Niang pi'' (\u917f\u76ae \u041d\u044f\u04a3 \u043f\u044b), a popular noodle cold dish in [[Linxia City|Linxia]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|China|Islam|Islam in China|Food}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Chinese cuisine]]\n* [[Iranian cuisine]]\n* [[Kazakh cuisine]]\n* [[Turkish cuisine]]\n* [[Islam in China]]\n* [[Xinjiang cuisine]]\n* [[Dali City]]\n* [[Gansu]]\n* [[Kunming]]\n* [[Lanzhou]]\n* [[Ningxia]]\n* [[Qinghai]]\n* [[Shaanxi]]\n* [[Xi'an]]\n* [[Yunnan]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Chinese Islamic cuisine}}\n*[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/09/PNGTF7H0QS1.DTL A San Francisco Chronicle article on a Chinese Islamic restaurant in the San Francisco Bay area]\n*[http://www.chinaheritagequarterly.org/features.php?searchterm=005_halal.inc&issue=005 chinaheritagequarterly.org]\n*[http://centralasianchef.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!C5B6F768391D3635!272.entry The Famous Dungan Noodles or Lyu Mian with Eight Seasoning Dishes!]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[http://s694.photobucket.com/albums/vv306/CyberChef/ More pictures of the Dungan Cuisine]\n\n{{Cuisine}}\n{{Religion in China}}\n{{Xinjiang topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chinese Islamic Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Chinese Islamic cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Regional cuisines of China]]\n[[Category:Islamic culture]]\n[[Category:Xinjiang]]\n[[Category:Multiculturalism and Islam]]", "sha1": "q48j2ppwsuw2me06qv0go316m7g6h7v"}}, {"title": "Cantonese cuisine", "ns": "0", "id": "6182", "revision": {"id": "866100910", "parentid": "862704031", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T07:40:00Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "replace portal link(s) with the on-topic portal, as a list item link, with small portal icon.", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox Chinese\n|pic= [[File:Flaming wok by KellyB in Bountiful, Utah.jpg|300px]] \n|piccap= Chefs cook with a [[wok]]\n|t=\u5ee3\u6771\u83dc\n|s=\u5e7f\u4e1c\u83dc\n|j=Gwong2 dung1 coi3\n|y=Gw\u00f3ng d\u016bng choi\n|p=Gu\u01cengd\u014dngc\u00e0i\n|ci={{IPAc-yue|gw|ong|2|d|ung|1|c|oi|3|}}\n|altname=Yue cuisine\n|t2=\u7cb5\u83dc\n|s2=\u7ca4\u83dc\n|j2=Jyut6 coi3\n|y2=Yuht choi\n|p2=Yu\u00e8c\u00e0i\n|ci2={{IPAc-yue|yut|6|c|oi|3|}}\n|showflag=y\n}}\n[[File:Cuisines of China.png|thumb|Map showing major regional cuisines of China]]\n\n'''Cantonese cuisine''' (\u5ee3\u6771\u83dc), also known as '''Yue cuisine''' (\u7cb5\u83dc) or '''Guangdong cuisine''', refers to the cuisine of China's [[Guangdong|Guangdong Province]], particularly the provincial capital, [[Guangzhou|Guangzhou (Canton)]].<ref name=\"Hsiung\">Hsiung, Deh-Ta.

Besides pork, beef and chicken, Cantonese cuisine incorporates almost all edible meats, including [[offal]], chicken feet, duck's tongue, frog legs, snakes and snails. However, lamb and goat are less commonly used than in the cuisines of northern or western China. Many cooking methods are used, with [[steaming]] and [[stir frying]] being the most favoured due to their convenience and rapidity. Other techniques include [[shallow frying]], [[double steaming]], [[braising]] and [[deep frying]].\n\nFor many traditional Cantonese cooks, the flavours of a dish should be well balanced and not greasy. Apart from that, spices should be used in modest amounts to avoid overwhelming the flavours of the primary ingredients, and these ingredients in turn should be at the peak of their freshness and quality. There is no widespread use of fresh [[herb]]s in Cantonese cooking, in contrast with their liberal use in other cuisines such as [[Sichuanese cuisine|Sichuanese]], [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], [[Lao cuisine|Lao]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] and [[European cuisine|European]]. [[Garlic chives]] and [[coriander]] leaves are notable exceptions, although the former are often used as a vegetable and the latter are usually used as mere garnish in most dishes.\n\n== Foods ==\n\n=== Sauces and condiments ===\nIn Cantonese cuisine, a number of ingredients such as [[sugar]], [[salt]], [[Soy sauce#Chinese|soy sauce]], [[Huangjiu|rice wine]], [[cornstarch]], [[vinegar]], [[scallion]] and [[sesame oil]], suffice to enhance flavour, although garlic is heavily used in some dishes, especially those in which internal organs, such as entrails, may emit unpleasant odours. [[Ginger]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[five-spice powder]], powdered [[black pepper]], [[star anise]] and a few other spices are also used, but often sparingly.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! English !!

This may be influenced by [[Hakka cuisine]], since the [[Hakka people|Hakkas]] were once a dominant group occupying [[History of Hong Kong under Imperial China|imperial Hong Kong]] and other southern territories.<ref name=\"Barber\">Barber, Nicola. [2004] (2004) Hong Kong. Gareth Stevens Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8368-5198-6}}</ref>\n\nSome items gain very intense flavours during the [[Drying (food)|drying]]/[[Food preservation|preservation]]/[[oxidation]] process and some foods are preserved to increase their shelf life. Some chefs combine both dried and fresh varieties of the same items in a dish. Dried items are usually soaked in water to [[Hydrate|rehydrate]] before cooking. These ingredients are generally not served ''a la carte'', but rather with vegetables or other Cantonese dishes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! English !! Traditional Chinese !! Simplified Chinese !!

Chinese herbs are often used as ingredients. There are basically two ways to make old fire soup \u2013 put ingredients and water in the pot and heat it directly on fire, which is called ''bou tong'' ({{zh|s=\u7172\u6c64|t=\u7172\u6e6f|j=bou1 tong1|p=b\u0101o t\u0101ng|labels=no}}); or put the ingredients in a small stew pot, and put it in a bigger pot filled with water, then heat the bigger pot on fire directly, which is called ''dun tong'' ({{zh|s=\u71c9\u6c64|t=\u71c9\u6e6f|j=dun6 tong1|p=d\u00f9n t\u0101ng|labels=no}}).

In Cantonese cuisine, as in cuisines from other parts of Asia, if seafood has a repugnant odour, strong spices and marinating juices are added; the freshest seafood is odourless and, in Cantonese culinary arts, is best cooked by steaming. For instance, in some recipes, only a small amount of [[soy sauce]], [[ginger]] and [[spring onion]] is added to steamed fish. In Cantonese cuisine, the light seasoning is used only to bring out the natural sweetness of the seafood. As a rule of thumb, the spiciness of a dish is usually inversely proportionate to the freshness of the ingredients.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! English !! Traditional Chinese !!

Teochew cuisine bears more similarities to that of [[Fujian cuisine]], with which it shares some dishes. This may be due to the similarity of Chaoshan's and Fujian's culture and language and to their geographic proximity.<ref name=kcc>{{citation|title=Food in Chinese culture : anthropological and historical perspectives |first=Kwang-chih |last=Chang |publisher=Yale University Press|year=1977}}</ref> However, Teochew cuisine is also influenced by [[Cantonese cuisine]] in its style and technique.<ref name=kcc/>\n\n==Background==\nTeochew cuisine is well known for its seafood and vegetarian dishes. Its use of flavouring is much less heavy-handed than most other Chinese cuisines and depends much on the freshness and quality of the ingredients for taste and flavour. As a delicate cuisine, oil is not often used in large quantities and there is a relatively heavy emphasis on poaching, steaming and [[braising]], as well as the common Chinese method of [[stir-frying]]. Teochew cuisine is also known for serving [[congee]] ({{zh|c=\u7cdc|p=m\u00ed|labels=no}}; or ''mue''), in addition to [[steamed rice]] or noodles with meals. The Teochew ''{{lang|zh|mue}}'' is rather different from the Cantonese counterpart, being very watery with the rice sitting loosely at the bottom of the bowl, while the Cantonese dish is more a thin gruel.\n\nAuthentic Teochew restaurants serve very strong [[oolong]] tea called [[Tieguanyin]] in very tiny cups before and after the meal. Presented as [[Gongfu tea ceremony|''gongfu'' tea]], the tea has a thickly bittersweet taste, colloquially known as ''gam gam'' ({{zh|c=\u7518\u7518|p=g\u0101n g\u0101n|labels=no}}).\n\nA condiment that is popular in Fujian and [[Taiwanese cuisine]] and commonly associated with cuisine of certain Teochew groups is [[shacha sauce]] ({{zh|s=\u6c99\u8336\u9171|t=\u6c99\u8336\u91ac|p=sh\u0101ch\u00e1 ji\u00e0ng|labels=no}}). It is made from soybean oil, garlic, shallots, chilies, brill fish and dried shrimp. The paste has a savoury and slightly spicy taste. As an ingredient, it has multiple uses: as a base for soups, as a rub for barbecued meats, as a seasoning for stir-fried dishes, or as a component for dipping sauces.\n\nIn addition to [[soy sauce]] (widely used in all Chinese cuisines), the Teochew diaspora in Southeast Asia use [[fish sauce]] in their cooking. It is used as a flavouring agent in soups and sometimes as a dipping sauce, as in Vietnamese spring rolls.\n\nTeochew chefs often use a special stock called [[Asian soups#Traditional soup bases|superior broth]] ({{zh|s=\u4e0a\u6c64|t=\u4e0a\u6e6f|p=sh\u00e0ngt\u0101ng|labels=no}}). This stock remains on the stove and is continuously replenished. Portrayed in popular media, some Hong Kong chefs allegedly use the same superior broth that is preserved for decades. This stock can as well be seen on Chaozhou TV's cooking programmes.\n\nThere is a notable feast in Teochew cuisine called ''{{lang|zh-Latn|jiat dot}}'' ({{zh|c=\u98df\u684c|p=sh\u00edzhu\u014d|l=food table|labels=no}}). A myriad of dishes are often served, which include [[shark fin soup]], [[Edible bird's nest|bird's nest soup]], lobster, steamed fish, roasted suckling pig and braised goose.\n\nTeochew chefs take pride in their skills of vegetable carving, and carved vegetables are used as garnishes on cold dishes and on the banquet table.\n\nTeochew cuisine is also known for a late night meal known as ''meh siao'' ({{zh|c=\u591c\u5bb5|p=y\u00e8xi\u0101o|labels=no}}) or ''[[Daa Laang|daa laang]]'' ({{zh|c=\u6253\u51b7|p=d\u01cel\u00e9ng|labels=no}}) among the Cantonese. Teochew people enjoy eating out close to midnight in restaurants or at roadside food stalls. Some [[dai pai dong]]-like eateries stay open till dawn.\n\nUnlike the typical menu selections of many other Chinese cuisines, Teochew restaurant menus often have a [[dessert]] section.\n\nMany people of Chaoshan origin, also known as Teochiu or Teochew people, have settled in Hong Kong and places in Southeast Asia like [[Singapore]], [[Cambodia]] and [[Thailand]]. Influences they bring can be noted in [[Singaporean cuisine]] and that of other settlements. A large number of Teochew people have also settled in Taiwan, evident in [[Taiwanese cuisine]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/48176894|title=The globalization of Chinese food|date=2002|publisher=University of Hawai\u02bbi Press|others=Wu, David Y.

There is also a large diaspora of Teochew people (most were from Southeast Asia) in the United States - particularly in California.

Dark and light soy sauce may also be added to the soup during the cooking stages. Some Teochew families like to add extra Chinese herbs such as [[Polygonatum|yuzhu (rhizome of Solomon's Seal)]] and [[Rhamnus (genus)|juzhi (buckthorn fruit)]] for a sweeter, slightly stronger flavoured soup. The dish is usually eaten with rice or noodles (sometimes as a noodle soup), and often served with [[youtiao]]. Garnish includes chopped coriander or green onions and a sprinkling of fried shallots. A variation of bak kut teh uses chicken instead of pork, which then becomes chik kut teh.

A [[decision problem]] {{mathcal|X}} is a member of '''co-NP''' if and only if its  [[complement (complexity)|complement]] {{overline|{{mathcal|X}}}} is in the complexity class '''[[NP (complexity)|NP]]'''. In simple terms, '''co-NP''' is the class of problems for which there is a polynomial-time algorithm that can verify ''no'' instances (sometimes called counterexamples) given the appropriate certificate. Equivalently, '''co-NP''' is the set of decision problems where the \"no\" instances can be accepted in polynomial time by a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]. <!-- DO NOT edit what you do not grasp! This is the second time this opening paragraph has been made wrong by an editor who did not know anything about complexity theory! -->\n\nAn example of an [[NP-complete|'''NP'''-complete]]  problem is the [[subset sum problem]]: given a finite set of integers, is there a non-empty subset that sums to zero? To give a proof of a \"yes\" instance, one must specify a non-empty subset that does sum to zero. The complementary problem is in '''co-NP''' and asks: \"given a finite set of integers, does every non-empty subset have a non-zero sum?\".\n\n==Relationship to other classes==\n[[P (complexity)|'''P''']], the class of polynomial time solvable problems, is a subset of both '''NP''' and '''co-NP'''. '''P''' is thought to be a strict subset in both cases (and demonstrably cannot be strict in one case and not strict in the other). '''NP''' and '''co-NP''' are also thought to be unequal.<ref>\n{{cite book | first = John E. | last = Hopcroft | title = Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation (2nd Edition) | publisher = Addison-Wesley | location = Boston | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-201-44124-1 }} Chap. 11.</ref> If so, then no '''NP'''-complete problem can be in '''co-NP''' and no [[co-NP-complete|'''co-NP'''-complete]] problem can be in '''NP'''.<ref name=\"\">{{cite book | title = P, NP, and NP-completeness: The Basics of Computational Complexity | last1 = Goldreich | first1 = Oded | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2010 | page = 155 | authorlink = Oded Goldreich | isbn = 9781139490092 }}</ref>\n\nThis can be shown as follows. Suppose there exists an '''NP'''-complete problem {{mathcal|X}}  that is in '''co-NP'''. Since all problems in '''NP''' can be reduced to {{mathcal|X}}, it follows that for every problem in '''NP''' we can construct a [[non-deterministic Turing machine]] that decides its complement in polynomial time, i.e., '''NP''' &sube; '''co-NP'''. From this it follows that the set of complements of the problems in '''NP''' is a subset of the set of complements of the problems in '''co-NP''', i.e., '''co-NP''' &sube; '''NP'''. Thus '''co-NP''' = '''NP'''. The proof that no '''co-NP'''-complete problem can be in '''NP''' if '''NP''' &ne; '''co-NP''' is symmetrical.\n\nIf a problem can be shown to be in both '''NP''' and '''co-NP''', that is generally accepted as strong evidence that the problem is probably not '''NP'''-complete (since otherwise '''NP''' = '''co-NP''').\n\nAn example of a problem that is known to belong to both '''NP''' and '''co-NP''' is [[Integer_factorization#Difficulty_and_complexity|integer factorization]]: given positive integers ''m'' and ''n'' determine if ''m'' has a factor less than ''n'' and greater than one.  Membership in '''NP''' is clear; if ''m'' does have such a factor then the factor itself is a certificate.  Membership in '''co-NP''' is also straightforward: one can just list the prime factors of ''m'', all greater or equal to n, which the verifier can confirm to be valid by multiplication and the [[AKS primality test]]. It is presently not known whether there is a polynomial-time algorithm for factorization, equivalently that integer factorization is in '''P''', and hence this example is interesting as one of the most natural problems known to be in '''NP''' and '''co-NP''' but not known to be in '''P'''.<ref>http://mathoverflow.net/q/31821</ref> <!-- Please do not edit this unless you know the technical details. -->\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{CZoo|coNP|C#conp}}\n\n{{ComplexityClasses}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Co-Np}}\n[[Category:Complexity classes]]", "sha1": "1h46t2fomd1lmog7fkgdccqm66k5h4p"}}, {"title": "Chuck Yeager", "ns": "0", "id": "6185", "revision": {"id": "866405611", "parentid": "866405600", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T03:30:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/172.251.138.188|172.251.138.188]] to version by WikiPedant.

Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision, saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot, along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school. In part, because of his maintenance background, he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units.\n\nYeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership. On {{nowrap|October 12}}, 1944, he became the first pilot in his group to make \"[[ace in a day]],\" downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission. Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot: when he flew into firing position against a [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]], the pilot of the aircraft panicked, breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman. Yeager said both pilots bailed out. He finished the war with 11.5 official victories, including one of the first air-to-air victories over a jet fighter, a German [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] that he shot down as it was on final approach for landing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/wwii/chuck-yeager-fighter-pilot/|last=Niderost|first=Eric|title=Chuck Yeager: Fighter Pilot|website=Warfare History Network|access-date=29 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckyeager.com/yeager-destroys-an-me-262|title=Encounter Report|date=6 November 1944}}</ref>\n\nIn his 1986 memoirs, Yeager recalled with disgust that \"atrocities were committed by both sides\" said he went on a mission with orders from the [[Eighth Air Force]] to \"strafe anything that moved.\"<ref name=\"Wolfgang W.

It is what could be called a rustic cuisine; [[local food|locally available ingredients]] predominate and preparation is simple.\n\nAn authentic Cajun meal is usually a three-pot affair, with one pot dedicated to the main dish, one dedicated to steamed [[rice]], special made sausages, or some seafood dish, and the third containing whatever vegetable is plentiful or available. [[Crawfish]], [[shrimp]], and [[andouille]] [[sausage]] are staple meats used in a variety of dishes.\n\nThe aromatic vegetables [[green bell pepper]] (''poivron''), [[onion]], and [[celery]] are called the holy trinity by Cajun chefs in Cajun and [[Louisiana Creole cuisine]]s. Roughly diced and combined in cooking, the method is similar to the use of the ''[[Mirepoix (cuisine)|mirepoix]]'' in traditional [[French cuisine]] which blends roughly diced onion, celery, and [[carrot]]. Characteristic aromatics for the Creole version may also include [[parsley]], [[bay leaf]], [[scallion|green onions]], dried [[cayenne pepper]], and dried [[black pepper]].\n\n==History==\n\nAround 1755, Acadians were forcibly deported by the British in 1755 in what was called [[Expulsion of the Acadians|''le Grand D\u00e9rangement'']], eventually settling in Southern Louisiana.<ref name=\"Gutierrez\">{{Cite book |last= Gutierrez |first= Paige C. |title= Cajun Foodways |publisher= University Press of Mississippi |date= 1992 |isbn= 0-8780-5563-0}} Retrieved 2014-04.</ref> {{rp|6}} Due to the extreme change in climate, Acadians were unable to cook their original dishes.<ref name=\"Bienvenu\">{{Cite book |author1=Bienvenu, Marcelle |author2=Brasseaux, Carl A. |author3=Brasseaux, Ryan A. |title= Stir the Pot: The History of Cajun Cuisine |publisher= Hippocrine Books |date=June 2008 |isbn= 0-7818-1212-7}} Retrieved 2014-04.</ref> {{rp|20}} Soon, their former culinary traditions were lost, and so, these other meals developed to become what is now considered classic Cajun cuisine traditions <ref name=\"Bienvenu\"/> {{rp|19\u201320}} (not to be confused with the more modern concept associated with [[Paul Prudhomme|Prudhomme]]'s style).<ref name=\"Read\">{{cite web| url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/434010916?accountid=14612 |title= Real Cajun Food, From Swamp to City: [Dining In, Dining Out / Style Desk] |author= Read, Mimi |publisher= New York Times |accessdate =2014-05-05}}</ref> Up through the 20th century, the meals were not elaborate but instead, rather basic.<ref name=\"Bienvenu\"/> {{rp|23}} The public's false perception of \"Cajun\" cuisine was based on Prudhomme's style of Cajun cooking, which was spicy, flavorful, and not true to the classic form of the cuisine.<ref name=\"Read\"/> Cajun and Creole label have been mistaken to be the same, but the origins of Creole cooking began in New Orleans, and Cajun cooking came 40 years after the establishment of New Orleans down south on the bayou.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Gonsoulin |first1=Brandy |title= 70 Miles of Distinction; Exploring the differences between Cajun and Creole cuisines |url= http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/food/sc-food-0130-creole-vs-cajun-20150127-story.html#page=1 |agency= Tribune Newspapers |issue=4pp |publisher= Orland |date= February 5, 2015}}</ref>\nToday, most restaurants serve dishes that consist of Cajun styles, which [[Paul Prudhomme]] dubbed \"Louisiana cooking\".<ref name=\"Prudhomme\">{{cite book |last= Prudhomme |first= Paul |title= Chef Paul Prudhomme's Louisiana Kitchen |publisher= William and Morrow Company, Inc. |date= 1984 |isbn=0-6880-2847-0}} Retrieved 2014-04.</ref> {{rp|16}} In home-cooking, these individual styles are still kept separate.<ref name=\"Prudhomme\"/> {{rp|16}} However, there are fewer and fewer people cooking the classic Cajun dishes that would have been eaten by the original settlers.<ref name=\"Bienvenu\"/> {{rp|30}}\n\n==Cajun cooking methods==\n*[[Barbecuing]] - similar to \"slow and low\" Southern barbecue traditions, but with Creole / Cajun seasoning.\n**[[Baking]] - direct and indirect dry heat in a furnace or oven, faster than [[Smoking (cooking)|smoking]] but slower than grilling.\n**[[Grilling]] - direct heat on a shallow surface, fastest of all variants; sub-variants include:\n***[[Charbroiling]] - direct dry heat on a solid surface with wide raised ridges.\n***[[Gridiron (cooking)|Gridironing]] - direct dry heat on a solid or hollow surface with narrow raised ridges.\n***[[Griddle|Griddling]] - direct dry or moist heat along with the use of oils and butter on a flat surface.\n**[[Braising]] - combining a direct dry heat charbroil-grill or gridiron-grill with a pot filled with broth for direct moist heat, faster than smoking but slower than regular grilling and baking; time starts fast, slows down, then speeds up again to finish.\n*[[Boiling]] - as in boiling of crabs, crawfish, or shrimp, in seasoned liquid.\n*[[Deep frying]]\n*[[Smothering (food)|Smothering]] - cooking a vegetable or meat with low heat and small amounts of water or stock, similar to [[braising]]. [[\u00c9touff\u00e9e]] is a popular variant done with [[Crayfish (food)|crawfish]] or shrimp.\n*Pan-[[broiling]] or [[pan-frying]].\n*Injecting - using a large [[syringe]]-type setup to place seasoning deep inside large cuts of meat. This technique is much newer than the others on this list, but very common in Cajun Country\n*[[Stewing]], also known as ''fricass\u00e9e''.\n\n[[Deep-frying]] of [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]s or oven-roasted [[turducken]]s entered southern Louisiana cuisine more recently. Also, [[Blackening (cooking)|blackening]] of fish or chicken and barbecuing of shrimp in the shell are excluded because they were not prepared in traditional Cajun cuisine. Blackening was actually an invention by chef [[Paul Prudhomme]] in the 1970s, becoming associated with Cajun cooking, and presented as such by him, but is not a true historical or traditional Cajun cooking process.<ref>\"[http://www.astray.com/recipes/?show=Blacken%20fish%20and%20recipe%20a%20la%20prudhomme Blacken fish and recipe ''a la'' Prudhomme\"]\".

With an abundance of water and a hot, humid climate, rice could be grown practically anywhere in the region and grew wild in some areas. Rice became the predominant starch in the diet, easy to grow, store and prepare.

Smoking of meats remains a fairly common practice, but once-common preparations such as turkey or [[duck confit]] (preserved in poultry fat, with spices) are now seen even by Acadians as quaint rarities.\n\nGame (and [[hunting]]) are still uniformly popular in Acadiana.\n\nThe recent increase of [[catfish]] [[Aquaculture of catfish|farming]] in the [[Mississippi Delta]] has brought about an increase in its usage in Cajun cuisine in the place of the more traditional wild-caught trout (the saltwater species) and [[red fish]].\n<div style=\"float:left; width:48%;\">\n'''Seafood'''\n*Freshwater <!--Please add more-->\n**[[Large mouth bass (fish)|Bass]] \n**[[Catfish]]\n**[[White perch|Sac-au-Lait]] (white perch or crappie)\n**[[Yellow perch]]\n*Saltwater or brackish water species\n**[[Cynoscion nebulosus|Trout]]\n**[[Red Drum|Redfish]]\n**[[Pompano]]\n**[[Sciaenidae|Drumfish]]\n**[[Flounder]]\n**[[Grouper]]\n**[[Perch]] - many varieties\n**[[Lutjanidae|Snapper]] - many varieties\n*Shellfish\n**[[Crawfish (food)|Crawfish]] (ecrevisse)- either wild swamp or farm-raised\n**[[Shrimp (food)|Shrimp]], or Crevette (\"Chevrette\" in Colonial Louisiana French)\n**[[Oyster]]s\n**[[Callinectes sapidus|Blue Crab]]\nAlso included in the seafood mix are some so-called [[trash fish]] that would not sell at market because of their high bone to meat ratio or required complicated cooking methods.

Other versions can contain seafood, such as crawfish.\n*Chaurice, similar to the Spanish [[chorizo]]\n*[[Chaudin]] or \"ponce\" - a pig's stomach, stuffed with spiced pork & smoked.\n*[[Ham hock]]s\n*[[Wild boar]] or Feral Hog\n*[[Head cheese]]\n*Gratons - hog cracklings or pork rinds; fried, seasoned pork fat & skin, sometimes with small bits of meat attached.

The sausage itself does not include rice, separating it from boudin.\n*Salt Pork\n*[[Tasso ham|Tasso]] - a highly seasoned, smoked pork shoulder of the Choctaw\n\n'''Beef and dairy'''<br>\nThough parts of Acadiana are well suited to cattle or dairy farming, beef is not often used in a pre-processed or uniquely Cajun form. It is usually prepared fairly simply as chops, stews, or steaks, taking a cue from Texas to the west. Ground beef is used as is traditional throughout the US, although seasoned differently.\n\nDairy farming is not as prevalent as in the past, but there are still some farms in the business. There are no unique dairy items prepared in Cajun cuisine.

Cajun seasonings consist of a blend of salt with a variety of spices, most common being cayenne pepper and garlic. The spicy heat comes from the cayenne pepper, while other flavors come from bell pepper, paprika, green onions, parsley and more.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Peterson |first1=Jenny |title= Louisiana Life |journal= Chachere's Creole Foods |date= July 2014 |volume=34 |issue=6 |page=8}}</ref>\n*[[Hot sauce]] that includes [[Tabasco sauce]] that by 1885 was well known in Louisiana and abroad.\n*[[Seafood boil]] mix\n*Vinegar seasoned with small, pickled, hot green peppers is a common condiment with many Cajun meals.\n*[[Persillade]]\n*[[Marinade]]s made with [[olive oil]], [[brown sugar]], and [[citrus]] juices\n*Various barbecue rubs similar to those in other states.\n*[[Worcestershire sauce]]\n\n===Cooking bases===\n*Dark [[roux]]: The Cajuns inherited the roux from the French. However, unlike the French, it is made with oil or bacon fat and more lately [[olive oil]], however, not normally with butter. It is used as a thickening agent, especially in gumbo and \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Preparation of a dark roux is probably the most involved or complicated procedure in Cajun cuisine,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Les Vingt |first1=Quatre Club |title= First-- you make a roux |date=1954 |publisher= Les Vingt Quatre Club |location= Lafayette, La |page=47}}</ref> involving heating fat and flour very carefully, constantly stirring for about 15\u201345 minutes (depending on the color of the desired product), until the mixture has darkened in color and developed a nutty flavor.

Pairing Roux with protein follows the same orthodox philosophy as pairing wine with protein.\n*[[Stock (food)|Stocks]]: Cajun stocks are more heavily seasoned than Continental counterparts, and the shellfish stock sometimes made with shrimp and crawfish heads is unique to Cajun cuisine.\n**Fish stock and [[Court-bouillon]]\n**Shellfish stock\n**Chicken stock\n\n==Cajun dishes==\nThree popular local dishes in Acadiana are noted in the [[Hank Williams]]'  song ''[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]'', namely \"Jambalaya and-a crawfish pie and fil\u00e9 gumbo\".\n\n===Primary favorites===\n[[File:Smoked Boudin Blanc.jpg|thumb|''Boudin'' that has been [[Smoking (food)|smoked]]]]\n[[File:Gumbo3bg 122499.jpg|thumb|Seafood gumbo]]\n'''[[Boudin]]''' is a type of [[sausage]] made from pork, pork liver, rice, garlic, [[scallion|green onions]] and other spices. It is widely available by the link or pound from butcher shops. Boudin is typically stuffed in a [[Casing (sausage)|natural casing]] and has a softer consistency than other, better-known sausage varieties. It is usually served with side dishes such as rice dressing, [[maque choux]] or bread. Boudin balls are commonly served in southern Louisiana restaurants and are made by taking the boudin out of the case and frying it in spherical form.\n\n'''Gumbo''' - High on the list of favorites of Cajun cooking are the soups called [[gumbo]]s. Contrary to non-Cajun or Continental beliefs, gumbo does not mean simply \"everything in the pot\". Gumbo exemplifies the influence of French, Spanish, African and [[Native American cuisine|Native American food]] cultures on Cajun cuisine. The name originally meant ''[[okra]]'', a word brought to the region from western [[Africa]]. Okra which can be one of the principal ingredients in gumbo recipes is used as a thickening agent and for its distinct vegetable flavor. Many claim that Gumbo is a \"Cajun\" dish, but Gumbo was established long before the Acadian arrival. Its early existence came via the early French Creole culture In New Orleans, Louisiana, where French, Spanish and Africans frequented and also influenced by later waves of Italian, German and Irish settlers.\n\nA fil\u00e9 gumbo is thickened with dried [[sassafras]] leaves after the stew has finished cooking, a practice borrowed from the [[Choctaw]] Indians. The backbone of a gumbo is [[roux]] of which there are two variations: Cajun, a golden brown [[roux]], and Creole, a dark [[roux]], which is made of flour, toasted until well-browned, and [[fat]] or [[cooking oil|oil]]. The classic gumbo is made with [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] and the Cajun sausage called [[andouille]], pronounced {ahn-doo-wee}, but the ingredients vary according to what is available.\n\n'''Jambalaya''' - Another classic Cajun dish is [[jambalaya]]. The only certain thing that can be said about a jambalaya is that it contains [[rice]], some sort of meat (such as chicken or beef), seafood (such as shrimp or crawfish) or almost anything else. Usually, however, one will find green peppers, onions, celery, tomatoes and hot chili peppers. Anything else is optional. This is also a great pre-Acadian dish, established by the Spanish in Louisiana.\n\n'''Rice and gravy''' - [[Rice and gravy]] dishes are a [[Staple food|staple]] of Cajun cuisine<ref name=LAFTRAVEL>{{cite web |url=http://www.lafayettetravel.com/eat|title= Eat |publisher=Lafayettetravel.com |accessdate=2012-11-24}}</ref>  and is usually a [[brown gravy]] based on pan drippings, which are [[Deglazing (cooking)|deglazed]] and simmered with extra seasonings and served over steamed or boiled rice. The dish is traditionally made from cheaper cuts of meat and cooked in a [[cast iron cookware|cast iron pot]], typically for an extended time period in order to let the tough cuts of meat become tender.<ref name=TAMU>{{cite web| url= http://generalhorticulture.tamu.edu/prof/recipes/smother/smother.html |title= Smothered Meat With Rice and Gravy |author= Reed, David W. |publisher= [[Texas A&M University]] |accessdate= 2012-11-24}}</ref> Beef,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jfolse.com/recipe_week/recipe0711/WAFB_071211%20smothered%20seven%20steak.html |title= Smothered seven steaks | access-date= 2012-11-26 |publisher= [[WAFB]] }}</ref> pork, chicken or any of a large variety of game meats are used for its preparation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.realcajunrecipes.com/recipes/cajun/rice-gravy/119.rcr | title= Rice and Gravy |publisher= Realcajunrecipes.com |accessdate=2012-11-24 }}</ref> Popular local varieties include [[hamburger steak]], smothered [[rabbit]],<ref>{{cite web| title=Smothered rabbit with mushrooms | url= http://beta.lpb.org/index.php/programs/folse_recipe/smothered_rabbit_with_mushrooms |accessdate= 2012-11-26 |publisher= [[Louisiana Public Broadcasting]] }}</ref> turkey necks,<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.jfolse.com/recipes/poultry/turkey05.htm| title= Smothered Turkey Necks in Onion Gravy | accessdate= 2012-11-26 | publisher= Chef John Folse & Company }}</ref> and [[Fricassee|chicken fricassee]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Chicken Fricassee |url= http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chicken-Fricassee/Detail.aspx |publisher= Allrecipes.com |accessdate= 2012-11-28}}</ref>\n\n===Food as an event===\n\n====Crawfish boil====\n[[File:Louisiana crawfish.jpg|thumb|Louisiana-style crawfish boil]]\nThe [[seafood boil|crawfish boil]] is a celebratory event where Cajuns boil crawfish, potatoes, onions and corn in large pots over propane cookers. Lemons and small muslin bags containing a mixture of bay leaves, mustard seeds, cayenne pepper, and other spices, commonly known as \"crab boil\" or \"crawfish boil\" are added to the water for seasoning. The results are then dumped onto large, newspaper-draped tables and in some areas covered in Creole/Cajun spice blends, such as REX, [[Zatarain's]], Louisiana Fish Fry, or Tony Chachere's. Also, [[cocktail sauce]], mayonnaise, and [[hot sauce]] are sometimes used. The seafood is scooped onto large trays or plates and eaten by hand. During times when crawfish are not abundant, shrimp and crabs are prepared and served in the same manner.\n\nAttendees are encouraged to \"suck the head\" of a crawfish by separating the abdomen of the [[crustacean]] and sucking out the abdominal fat/juices.\n\nOften, newcomers to the crawfish boil or those unfamiliar with the traditions are jokingly warned \"not to eat the dead ones.\" This comes from the common belief that when live crawfish are boiled, their tails curl beneath themselves, but when dead crawfish are boiled, their tails are straight and limp.\nSeafood boils with crabs and shrimp are also popular.\n\n====Family Boucherie====\n[[File:Lakeview Boucherie5 Piggy goes to pieces HRoe 2013.jpg|thumb|A traditional \"boucherie\" near [[Eunice, Louisiana|Eunice]]]]\nThe traditional Cajun outdoor food event hosted by a farmer in the rural areas of the Acadiana.

Traditionally, a [[suckling pig]] was purchased for the event, but in modern ''cochon de lait''s, adult pigs are used.<ref name=\"Gutierrez\"/> {{rp|111}} Unlike the family boucherie, a hog is not butchered by the hosts and there are generally not as many guests or activities.<ref name=\"Gutierrez\"/> {{rp|112}} The host and male guests have the task of roasting the pig (see [[pig roast]]) while female guests bring side dishes.\n\n====Rural Mardi Gras====\nThe traditional Cajun Mardi Gras (see: ''[[Courir de Mardi Gras]]'') is a Mardi Gras celebration in rural Cajun Parishes. The tradition originated in the 18th century with the Cajuns of Louisiana, but it was abandoned in the early 20th century because of unwelcome violence associated with the event. In the early 1950s the tradition was revived in [[Mamou, Louisiana|Mamou]] in [[Evangeline Parish]].<ref name=\"Gutierrez\"/> {{rp|112}}\n\nThe event revolves around male maskers on horseback who ride into the countryside to collect food ingredients for the party later on. They entertain householders with Cajun music, dancing, and festive antics in return for the ingredients. The preferred ingredient is a live chicken in which the householder throws the chicken to allow the maskers to chase it down (symbolizing a hunt), but other ingredients include rice, sausage, vegetables, or frozen chicken.<ref name=\"Gutierrez\"/> {{rp|112}} Unlike other Cajun events, men take no part in cooking the main course for the party, and women prepare the chicken and ingredients for the gumbo.<ref name=\"Gutierrez\"/> {{rp|113}}\n\nOnce the festivities begin, the Cajun community members eat and dance to Cajun music until midnight, as the beginning of [[Lent]].<ref name=\"Gutierrez\"/> {{rp|113}}\n\n===Other dishes and sides===\n[[File:Boudin Sausage Balls.jpg|thumb|Boudin balls]]\n* [[Alligator meat]]\n* [[Andouille|Andouille sausage]]\n* [[Seafood boil#Louisiana|Boiled crawfish]]\n* [[Boudin#Types|Boudin balls]] - Boudin-sausage filling that is rolled into a ball, battered and deep fried, instead of being stuffed into pork casings.<ref>{{Cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uha0mHZ-N8oC&lpg=PA141&ots=D_tqH6GuQC&dq=%22boudin%20ball%22&pg=PA141#v=onepage&q=%22boudin%20ball%22&f=false |last= Stern |first=Michael |title=500 Things to Eat Before It's Too Late: And the Very Best Places to Eat Them |publisher= Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |date=2009 |page=141 |isbn= 978-0-547-05907-5 |accessdate= 2009-11-24}}</ref>\n* [[Brochette]]\n* [[Creole rice]]\n* [[Catfish]] (or [[redfish]]) [[court-bouillon]]\n* [[Suckling pig|Cochon de lait]]\n* [[Couche couche]] (Creole [[Cornbread|corn mush]])\n* [[Crayfish as food|Crawfish]] [[Bisque (food)|bisque]]\n* Crawfish [[\u00e9touff\u00e9e]]\n* [[Crawfish pie]]\n* [[Creole cream cheese]] and [[Creole cream cheese#Creole cream cheese ice cream|Creole cream cheese ice cream]]\n* [[Cr\u00eape]]\n* [[Dirty rice]]\n* [[\u00c9touff\u00e9e]]\n* Fried [[frog legs]]\n* [[Gumbo#Gumbo z'herbes|Gumbo z'herbes]] {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u028c|m|b|o\u028a|_|\u02c8|z|\u00e6|b}}\n* [[Head cheese|Hog's head cheese]]\n* [[Maque choux]]\n* [[Pecan]] [[praline]]s\n* [[Pepper jelly]]\n* [[Potato salad]], generally made with egg, potato, celery, onions, mayonnaise, mustard and sometimes bell pepper\n* [[Sauce piquante]] (Shrimp, Alligator, Turtle, and so on.)\n* Seafood-stuffed [[Chayote|Mirliton]]\n* [[Tarte \u00e0 la bouillie]] (sweet-dough custard tarts)\n* [[Tasso ham]]\n* [[Poutine (Creole)]] - A traditional Sunday supper deriving from the French \"Boeuf Bourgignon\" but served with a thick gravy from which it derives its name, Poutine, meaning \"pudding\".

In order to weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors on the bishop's see with the prerogatives of secular princes, thus establishing the [[Electorate of Cologne]], formed by the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of [[J\u00fclich]], as well as the [[Duchy of Westphalia]] on the other side of the Rhine, beyond [[Berg (state)|Berg]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]].\nBy the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince elector, he was Arch-chancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803.\n\nFollowing the [[Battle of Worringen]] in 1288, Cologne gained its independence from the archbishops and became a [[Free Imperial City|Free City]]. Archbishop [[Sigfried II von Westerburg]] was forced into exile in [[Bonn]].<ref name=\"Catholic Encyclopedia\">Harry de Quetteville. \"[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04116a.htm History of Cologne]\". ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 28 November 2009.</ref>\nThe archbishop nevertheless preserved the right of capital punishment. Thus the municipal council (though in strict political opposition towards the archbishop) depended upon him in all matters concerning criminal justice. This included torture, which sentence was only allowed to be handed down by the episcopal judge, the so-called \"Greve\". This legal situation lasted until the French conquest of Cologne.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nBesides its economic and political significance Cologne also became an important centre of medieval pilgrimage, when Cologne's Archbishop [[Rainald of Dassel]] gave the relics of the [[Three Wise Men]] to Cologne's cathedral in 1164 (after they, in fact, had been captured from [[Milan]]). Besides the three magi Cologne preserves the relics of [[Saint Ursula]] and [[Albertus Magnus]].<ref>Joseph P. Huffman, ''Family, Commerce, and Religion in London and Cologne'' (1998) covers from 1000 to 1300.</ref>\n\nCologne's location on the river Rhine placed it at the intersection of the major [[trade route]]s between east and west as well as the main Western Europe trade route, South \u2013 North Northern Italy-Flanders. These two trade routes were the basis of Cologne's growth. By 1300 the city population was 50,000-55,000.<ref>''The population of European cities'', Bairoch</ref> Cologne was a member of the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1475, when [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] confirmed the city's imperial immediacy.<ref name=\"Cologne History\"/>\n\n[[File:Cologn1411.jpg|thumb|upright=2.5|center|Cologne around 1411]]\n\n===Early modern history===\nThe economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were characterised by the city's status as a major harbour and transport hub on the Rhine. Craftsmanship was organised by self-administering guilds, some of which were exclusive to women.\n\nAs a free city, Cologne was a sovereign state within the Holy Roman Empire and as such had the right (and obligation) to maintain its own military force. As they wore a red uniform, these troops were known as the ''Rote Funken'' (red sparks). These soldiers were part of the Army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (\"Reichskontingent\") and fought in the wars of the 17th and 18th century, including the wars against revolutionary France, when the small force was almost completely wiped out in combat. The tradition of these troops is preserved as a military persiflage by Cologne's most outstanding carnival society, the ''Rote Funken''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rote-funken.de/ |title=Rote Funken \u2013 K\u00f6lsche Funke rut-wie\u00df vun 1823 e.V. \u2013 Rote Funken Koeln |publisher=Rote-funken.de |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe free city of Cologne must not be confused with the [[Archbishopric of Cologne]] which was a state of its own within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Since the second half of the 16th century the archbishops were drawn from the [[Bavaria]] [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty. Due to the free status of Cologne, the archbishops were usually not allowed to enter the city. Thus they took up residence in [[Bonn]] and later in [[Br\u00fchl, North Rhine-Westphalia|Br\u00fchl]] on the Rhine. As members of an influential and powerful family, and supported by their outstanding status as [[Prince-elector|electors]], the archbishops of Cologne repeatedly challenged and threatened the free status of Cologne during the 17th and 18th centuries, resulting in complicated affairs, which were handled by diplomatic means and propaganda as well as by the supreme courts of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\n===From the 19th century until World War II===\n[[File:Hohestra\u00dfe - C\u00f6ln am Rhein, 1912.tif|thumb|Hohestra\u00dfe, 1912]]\n[[File:H\u00e4ngebr\u00fccke - K\u00f6ln (1).tif|thumb|H\u00e4ngebr\u00fccke]]\nCologne lost its status as a [[Free Imperial City|free city]] during the French period. According to the Peace [[Treaty of Lun\u00e9ville]] (1801) all the territories of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] on the left bank of the Rhine were officially incorporated into the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] (which had already occupied Cologne in 1794). Thus this region later became part of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's]] Empire. Cologne was part of the French [[Department (administrative division)|D\u00e9partement]] [[Roer (department)|Roer]] (named after the river Roer, German: [[Rur]]) with [[Aachen]] (French: Aix-la-Chapelle) as its capital. The French modernised public life, for example by introducing the [[Napoleonic code]] and removing the old elites from power. The [[Napoleonic code]] remained in use on the left bank of the Rhine until 1900, when a unified civil code (the ''[[B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch]]'') was introduced in the [[German Empire]]. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], Cologne was made part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], first in the [[Province of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg province]] and then the [[Rhine province]].\n\nThe permanent tensions between the Roman Catholic [[Rhineland]] and the overwhelmingly Protestant Prussian state repeatedly escalated with Cologne being in the focus of the conflict. In 1837 the archbishop of Cologne, [[Clemens August von Droste-Vischering]], was arrested and imprisoned for two years after a dispute over the legal status of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics (''Mischehenstreit''). In 1874, during the [[Kulturkampf]], Archbishop [[Paul Melchers]] was imprisoned before taking asylum in the Netherlands. These conflicts alienated the Catholic population from Berlin and contributed to a deeply felt anti-Prussian resentment, which was still significant after World War II, when the former mayor of Cologne, [[Konrad Adenauer]], became the first West German chancellor.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Cologne absorbed numerous surrounding towns, and by World War&nbsp;I had already grown to 700,000 inhabitants. Industrialisation changed the city and spurred its growth. Vehicle and engine manufacturing was especially successful, though the heavy industry was less ubiquitous than in the [[Ruhr area]]. The [[Cologne Cathedral|cathedral]], started in 1248 but abandoned around 1560, was eventually finished in 1880 not just as a place of worship but also as a German national monument celebrating the newly founded [[German empire]] and the continuity of the German nation since the Middle Ages. Some of this urban growth occurred at the expense of the city's historic heritage with much being demolished (for example, the city walls or the area around the cathedral) and sometimes replaced by contemporary buildings.\n\nCologne was designated as one of the [[Fortresses of the German Confederation]].<ref name=USM>[https://books.google.com/books?dq=%22Federal+Fortress+on+the+Upper+Rhine%22&pg=PA254&id=B77POH6Wgk4C United Services Magazine], December 1835</ref> It was turned into a heavily armed fortress (opposing the French and Belgian fortresses of [[Verdun]] and [[Li\u00e8ge (city)|Li\u00e8ge]]) with two fortified belts surrounding the city, the remains of which can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altearmee.de/zwischenwerk/index.htm |title=Festung K\u00f6ln |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref> The military demands on what became Germany's largest fortress presented a significant obstacle to urban development, with forts, bunkers, and wide defensive dugouts completely encircling the city and preventing expansion; this resulted in a very densely built-up area within the city itself.\n\nDuring [[World War&nbsp;I]] Cologne was the target of several minor air raids but suffered no significant damage. Cologne was occupied by the [[British Army of the Rhine]] until 1926, under the terms of the Armistice and the subsequent [[Peace Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Peace Treaty]].<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,721598,00.html Cologne Evacuated], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', 15 February 1926</ref>\nIn contrast with the harsh behaviour of the French occupation troops in Germany, the British forces were more lenient to the local population. [[Konrad Adenauer]], the mayor of Cologne from 1917 until 1933 and later a West German chancellor, acknowledged the political impact of this approach, especially since Britain had opposed French demands for a permanent Allied occupation of the entire Rhineland.\n\nAs part of the demilitarisation of the [[Rhineland]], the city's fortifications had to be dismantled. This was an opportunity to create two green belts (''Gr\u00fcng\u00fcrtel'') around the city by converting the fortifications and their fields of fire into large public parks. This was not completed until 1933. In 1919 the [[University of Cologne]], closed by the French in 1798, was reopened. This was considered to be a replacement for the loss of the [[University of Strasbourg]] on the west bank of the Rhine, which reverted to France with the rest of [[Alsace]]. Cologne prospered during the [[Weimar Republic]] (1919\u201333), and progress was made especially in public governance, city planning, housing and social affairs. Social housing projects were considered exemplary and were copied by other German cities. Cologne competed to host the Olympics, and a modern sports stadium was erected at M\u00fcngersdorf. When the British occupation ended, the prohibition of civil aviation was lifted and [[Cologne Butzweilerhof Airport]] soon became a hub for national and international air traffic, second in Germany only to [[Tempelhof International Airport|Berlin Tempelhof Airport]].\n\nThe democratic parties lost the local elections in Cologne in March 1933 to the [[Nazi Party]] and other right wing parties. The Nazis then arrested the [[KPD|Communist]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]] members of the city assembly, and Mayor Adenauer was dismissed. Compared to some other major cities, however, the Nazis never gained decisive support in Cologne. (Significantly, the number of votes cast for the Nazi Party in [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] elections had always been the national average.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080211085633/http://weimarer-wahlen.de/de/index.html |archivedate=11 February 2008 |title=Weimarer Wahlen |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=11 February 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wahlen-in-deutschland.de/wrtwkoelnaachen.htm |title=Voting results 1919\u20131933 Cologne-Aachen |publisher=Wahlen-in-deutschland.de |date= |accessdate=8 August 2010}}</ref> By 1939 the population had risen to 772,221 inhabitants.\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Koeln 1945.jpg|thumb|The devastation of Cologne, 1945]]\nDuring World War II, Cologne was a Military Area Command Headquarters (''Milit\u00e4rbereichshauptkommandoquartier'') for the [[Military district (Germany)|Military District]] (''Wehrkreis'') VI of [[M\u00fcnster]]. Cologne was under the command of Lieutenant-General Freiherr Roeder von Diersburg, who was responsible for military operations in [[Bonn]], [[Siegburg]], [[Aachen]], [[J\u00fclich]], [[D\u00fcren]], and [[Monschau]].

With [[Bonn]] being chosen as the provisional federal capital (''provisorische Bundeshauptstadt'') and seat of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany (then informally [[West Germany]]), Cologne benefited by being sandwiched between two important political centres. The city became\u2013and still is\u2013home to a number of federal agencies and organizations. After reunification in 1990, Berlin was made the capital of Germany.\n\nIn 1945 architect and urban planner [[Rudolf Schwarz (architect)|Rudolf Schwarz]] called Cologne the \"world's greatest heap of rubble\". Schwarz designed the master plan for reconstruction in 1947, which included the construction of several new thoroughfares through the city centre, especially the ''Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt'' (\"North-South-Drive\"). The master plan took into consideration the fact that even shortly after the war a large increase in automobile traffic could be anticipated. Plans for new roads had already, to a certain degree, evolved under the Nazi administration, but the actual construction became easier when most of the city centre was in ruins.\n\nThe destruction of 95% of the city centre, including the famous [[Twelve Romanesque churches of Cologne|Twelve Romanesque churches]] such as [[St. Gereon's Basilica|St.&nbsp;Gereon]], [[Great St. Martin Church|Great St.&nbsp;Martin]], [[St.&nbsp;Maria im Kapitol]] and several other monuments in World War&nbsp;II, meant a tremendous loss of cultural treasures. The rebuilding of those churches and other landmarks such as the G\u00fcrzenich event hall was not undisputed among leading architects and art historians at that time, but in most cases, civil intention prevailed. The reconstruction lasted until the 1990s, when the Romanesque church of [[St. Kunibert (Cologne)|St.&nbsp;Kunibert]] was finished.\n\nIn 1959, the city's population reached pre-war numbers again. It then grew steadily, exceeding 1&nbsp;million for about one year from 1975. It remained just below that until mid-2010, when it exceeded 1&nbsp;million again.\n[[File:2013-08-10 07-18-55 Ballonfahrt \u00fcber K\u00f6ln EH 0626.jpg|thumb|left|Cologne in 2013]]\n\n===Post-reunification===\n[[File:1983 09 15 to 23 Envelope of the Letter from Odessa to Cuba.jpg|thumb|Soviet letter's envelope in honor of the Internationale Philatelic Exhibition ''LUPOSTA'' in Cologne in 1983.]]\nIn the 1980s and 1990s Cologne's economy prospered for two main reasons. The first was the growth in the number of media companies, both in the private and public sectors; they are especially catered for in the newly developed Media Park, which creates a strongly visual focal point in Cologne city centre and includes the ''K\u00f6lnTurm'', one of Cologne's most prominent high-rise buildings. The second was the permanent improvement of the diverse traffic infrastructure, which made Cologne one of the most easily accessible metropolitan areas in Central Europe.\n\nDue to the economic success of the [[Cologne Trade Fair]], the city arranged a large extension to the fair site in 2005. At the same time the original buildings, which date back to the 1920s, were rented out to [[Mediengruppe RTL Deutschland|RTL]], Germany's largest private broadcaster, as their new corporate headquarters.\n\nCologne was the focus of the 2015 [[New Year's Eve sexual assaults in Germany|New Year's Eve sexual assaults]], with over 500 women reporting that they were sexually assaulted by persons of African and Arab appearance.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/tensions-rise-in-germany-over-handling-of-mass-sexual-assaults-in-cologne|title=Tensions rise in Germany over handling of mass sexual assaults in Cologne|last=Connolly|first=Kate| publisher=The Guardian|date=7 January 2016|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"waz2\">{{cite web|url=https://www.derwesten.de/politik/1075-anzeigen-nach-koelner-silvesternacht-73-verdaechtige-id11567004.html|title=1075 Anzeigen nach K\u00f6lner Silvesternacht \u2013 73 Verd\u00e4chtige|trans-title=1,075 assaults by Cologne New Year's Eve \u2013 73 suspects|work=[[Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung]]|language=German|accessdate=15 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe metropolitan area encompasses over {{convert|405|km2|0|abbr=off}}, extending around a central point that lies at 50\u00b0 56' 33 latitude and 6\u00b0 57' 32 longitude.

Various interest groups often form networks beyond party boundaries. The resulting web of relationships, with political, economic, and cultural links with each other in a system of mutual favours, obligations and dependencies, is called the 'Cologne coterie'. This has often led to an unusual proportional distribution in the city government and degenerated at times into corruption: in 1999, a \"waste scandal\" over kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions came to light, which led not only to the imprisonment of the entrepreneur Hellmut Trienekens, but also to the downfall of almost the entire leadership of the ruling Social Democrats.\n\n===Mayor===\nThe Lord Mayor of Cologne is [[Henriette Reker]].

The reconstruction of the city followed the style of the 1950s, while respecting the old layout and naming of the streets. Thus, the city today is characterized by simple and modest post-war buildings, with a few interspersed pre-war buildings which were reconstructed due to their historical importance. Some buildings of the \"Wiederaufbauzeit\" (era of reconstruction), for example, the opera house by [[Wilhelm Riphahn]], are nowadays regarded as classics of modern architecture.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ay8mnbMwYesC&pg=PT35&lpg=PT35&dq=The+inner+city+of+Cologne+was+completely+destroyed+during+World+War+II.+The+reconstruction+of+the+city+followed+the+style+of+the+1950s,+while+respecting+the+old+layout+and+naming+of+the+streets.+Thus,+the+city+today+is+characterized+by+simple+and+modest+post-war+buildings,+with+a+few+interspersed+pre-war+buildings+which+were+reconstructed+due+to+their+historical+importance.+Some+buildings+of+the+%22Wiederaufbauzeit%22+(era+of+reconstruction),+for+example,+the+opera+house+by+Wilhelm+Riphahn,+are+nowadays+regarded+as+classics+of+modern+architecture.&source=bl&ots=ofJlT_fW3J&sig=ZW8uf284rvWeNz3zMy5GV3sjXY0&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi1_e-TiNvaAhVKr1QKHV-CDDMQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&q=The%20inner%20city%20of%20Cologne%20was%20completely%20destroyed%20during%20World%20War%20II.%20The%20reconstruction%20of%20the%20city%20followed%20the%20style%20of%20the%201950s%2C%20while%20respecting%20the%20old%20layout%20and%20naming%20of%20the%20streets.%20Thus%2C%20the%20city%20today%20is%20characterized%20by%20simple%20and%20modest%20post-war%20buildings%2C%20with%20a%20few%20interspersed%20pre-war%20buildings%20which%20were%20reconstructed%20due%20to%20their%20historical%20importance.%20Some%20buildings%20of%20the%20%22Wiederaufbauzeit%22%20(era%20of%20reconstruction)%2C%20for%20example%2C%20the%20opera%20house%20by%20Wilhelm%20Riphahn%2C%20are%20nowadays%20regarded%20as%20classics%20of%20modern%20architecture.&f=false|title=Heidi Klum & Seal The truth about the divorce|last=Hombach|first=Jean-Pierre|publisher=|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4716-2190-1|location=|pages=31|language=en}}</ref> Nevertheless, the uncompromising style of the [[Cologne Opera]] house and other modern buildings has remained controversial.\n\nGreen areas account for over a quarter of Cologne, which is approximately {{convert|75|m2|2|abbr=on}} of public green space for every inhabitant.<ref>{{cite web|title=Green Cologne|url=http://www.koeln.de/cologne_tourist_information/exploring_city/green_cologne|publisher=K\u00f6lnTourismus|accessdate=17 April 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe presence of animals in Cologne is generally limited to insects, small rodents, and several species of birds.

The sheltered climate in southeast [[Northrhine-Westphalia]] allows these birds to survive through the winter, and in some cases, they are displacing native species.

Cologne was also an important hotbed for electronic music in the 1950s (Studio f\u00fcr elektronische Musik, [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]]) and again from the 1990s onward. The public radio and TV station [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] was involved in promoting musical movements such as [[Krautrock]] in the 1970s; the influential [[Can (band)|Can]] was formed there in 1968. There are several centres of nightlife, among them the ''Kwartier Lat\u00e4ng'' (the student quarter around the Z\u00fclpicher Stra\u00dfe) and the nightclub-studded areas around [[Hohenzollernring]], Friesenplatz and Rudolfplatz.\n\n[[File:Water feature in Cologne, Germany.jpg|thumb|left|Water feature in Cologne, Germany, summer of 2017.]]The large annual literary festival Lit. Cologne features regional and international authors. The main literary figure connected with Cologne is the writer [[Heinrich B\u00f6ll]], winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]].\n\nCologne is well known for its beer, called [[K\u00f6lsch (beer)|K\u00f6lsch]]. [[Colognian language|K\u00f6lsch]] is also the name of the local dialect. This has led to the common joke of K\u00f6lsch being the only language one can drink.\n\nCologne is also famous for [[Eau de Cologne]] (German: ''K\u00f6lnisch Wasser''; lit: \"Water of Cologne\"), a perfume created by Italian expatriate [[Johann Maria Farina]] at the beginning of the 18th century. During the 18th century, this perfume became increasingly popular, was exported all over Europe by the Farina family and ''Farina'' became a household name for ''Eau de Cologne''. In 1803 Wilhelm M\u00fclhens entered into a contract with an unrelated person from Italy named Carlo Francesco Farina who granted him the right to use his family name and M\u00fchlens opened a small factory at Cologne's Glockengasse. In later years, and after various court battles, his grandson [[Ferdinand M\u00fclhens]] was forced to abandon the name ''Farina'' for the company and their product. He decided to use the house number given to the factory at Glockengasse during the French occupation in the early 19th century, [[4711 (brand)|4711]]. Today, original Eau de Cologne is still produced in Cologne by both the [[Johann Maria Farina gegen\u00fcber dem J\u00fclichs-Platz|Farina family]], currently in the eighth generation, and by [[M\u00e4urer & Wirtz]] who bought the 4711 brand in 2006.\n\n===Carnival===\nThe [[Cologne carnival]] is one of the largest street festivals in Europe. In Cologne, the carnival season officially starts on 11 November at 11 minutes past 11&nbsp;a.m. with the proclamation of the new Carnival Season, and continues until [[Ash Wednesday]]. However, the so-called \"Tolle Tage\" (crazy days) do not start until ''Weiberfastnacht'' (Women's Carnival) or, in dialect, ''Wieverfastelovend'', the Thursday before Ash Wednesday, which is the beginning of the street carnival. Z\u00fclpicher Strasse and its surroundings, Neumarkt square, Heumarkt and all bars and pubs in the city are crowded with people in costumes dancing and drinking in the streets. Hundreds of thousands of visitors flock to Cologne during this time. Generally, around a million people celebrate in the streets on the Thursday before Ash Wednesday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125230206/http://www.stadt-koeln.de/en/koelntourismus/karneval/ |archivedate=25 January 2008 |title=Carnival \u2013 Cologne's \"fifth season\" \u2013 Cologne Sights & Events \u2013 Stadt K\u00f6ln |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=24 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Rivalry with D\u00fcsseldorf===\nCologne and [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] have a \"fierce regional rivalry\",<ref name=\"Rivalry\">{{cite news|title=Giving Beer A Home in the Rhineland|url=http://www.thelocal.de/society/20110728-36597.html|accessdate=28 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Local]]|date=28 July 2011}}</ref> which includes [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|carnival]] parades, [[Association football|football]], and beer.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> People in Cologne prefer [[K\u00f6lsch (beer)|K\u00f6lsch]] while people in D\u00fcsseldorf prefer [[Altbier]] (\"Alt\").<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> Waiters and patrons will \"scorn\" and make a \"mockery\" of people who order Alt beer in Cologne or K\u00f6lsch in D\u00fcsseldorf.<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/> The rivalry has been described as a \"love\u2013hate relationship\".<ref name=\"Rivalry\"/>\n\n===Museums===\n[[File:Museum Ludwig K\u00f6ln - S\u00fcdeingang - Schriftzug.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum Ludwig]] houses one of the most important collections of [[modern art]].]]\n[[File:Dionysusmoza\u00efek 17-02-2009 10-51-23.JPG|thumb|Roman [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] in Cologne: [[Dionysus]] Mosaic on display at [[R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Museum]]]]\n\n{{Main|List of museums in Cologne}}\n* [[Fragrance Museum|Farina Fragrance Museum]] \u2013 birthplace of [[Eau de Cologne]]\n* [[R\u00f6misch-Germanisches Museum]] (Roman-Germanic Museum) \u2013 ancient Roman and Germanic culture\n* [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] \u2013 European painting from the 13th to the early 20th century\n* [[Museum Ludwig]] \u2013 modern art\n* [[Museum Schn\u00fctgen]] \u2013 medieval art\n* [[Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst (Cologne)|Museum f\u00fcr Angewandte Kunst]] \u2013 [[applied art]]\n* [[Kolumba|Kolumba Kunstmuseum des Erzbistums K\u00f6ln]] ([[art museum]] of the Archbishopric of Cologne) \u2013 modern art museum built around medieval ruins, completed 2007\n* Cathedral Treasury \"Domschatzkammer\" \u2013 historic underground vaults of the Cathedral\n* [[EL-DE Haus]] \u2013 former local headquarters of the [[Gestapo]] houses a museum documenting [[Nazi]] rule in Cologne with a special focus on the persecution of political dissenters and minorities\n* German Sports and Olympic Museum \u2013 exhibitions about sports from antiquity until the present\n* [[Imhoff-Schokoladenmuseum]] \u2013 Chocolate Museum\n* Geomuseum of the University of Cologne \u2013 the exhibition includes fossils (such as [[dinosaur]] bones and the skeleton of an [[Eryops]]), [[stones]] and [[minerals]]\n* Forum for Internet Technology in Contemporary Art \u2013 collections of Internet-based art, corporate part of (NewMediaArtProjectNetwork):cologne, the experimental platform for art and New Media\n* [[Flora und Botanischer Garten K\u00f6ln]] \u2013 the city's formal park and main [[botanical garden]]\n* [[Forstbotanischer Garten K\u00f6ln]] \u2013 an [[arboretum]] and woodland [[botanical garden]]\n\n===Music fairs and festivals===\nThe city was home to the internationally famous [[Ringfest]], and now to the C/o pop festival.<ref name=\"C/o pop\"> {{cite web\n| url=http://www.c-o-pop.de/home.4.en.html\n| title=C/o Pop Official Website\n| publisher=\n}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Cologne enjoys a thriving Christmas Market (''Weihnachtsmarkt'') presence with several locations in the city.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Koelnmesse Nordeingang.jpg|thumb|North entrance to [[Koelnmesse]], 2008]]\n[[File:Rheinauhafen - The Bench - Rheinseite (1828-30).jpg|thumb|Modern office building at [[Rheinauhafen]]]]\nAs the largest city in the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] metropolitan region, Cologne benefits from a large [[market structure]].<ref>[http://www.stadt-koeln.de/mediaasset/content/pdf80/cbg_2009_bfrei_deutsch.pdf stadt-koeln.de ''Cologne Business Guide''] {{de icon}} {{en icon}}</ref> In competition with [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the economy of Cologne is primarily based on [[Insurance industry|insurance]] and [[media industry|media industries]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125964/Cologne/61370/Economy|title=Cologne|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> while the city is also an important cultural and research centre and home to a number of [[corporate headquarters]].\n\nAmong the largest media companies based in Cologne are [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]], [[RTL Television]] (with subsidiaries), [[n-tv]], [[Deutschlandradio]], [[Brainpool TV]] and publishing houses like J.&nbsp;P.

The first German limited-access road was constructed after 1929 between Cologne and [[Bonn]]. Today, this is the [[Bundesautobahn 555]]. In 1965, Cologne became the first German city to be fully encircled by a motorway ring road. Roughly at the same time, a city centre bypass (''Stadtautobahn'') was planned, but only partially put into effect, due to opposition by environmental groups. The completed section became ''Bundesstra\u00dfe (\"Federal Road\") B 55a'', which begins at the ''Zoobr\u00fccke'' (\"Zoo Bridge\") and meets with [[Bundesautobahn 4|A&nbsp;4]] and [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] at the interchange Cologne East. Nevertheless, it is referred to as ''Stadtautobahn'' by most locals. In contrast to this, the ''Nord-S\u00fcd-Fahrt'' (\"North-South-Drive\") was actually completed, a new four/six-lane city centre through-route, which had already been anticipated by planners such as [[Fritz Schumacher (architect)|Fritz Schumacher]] in the 1920s. The last section south of ''Ebertplatz'' was completed in 1972.\n\nIn 2005, the first stretch of an eight-lane motorway in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] was opened to traffic on [[Bundesautobahn&nbsp;3]], part of the eastern section of the [[Cologne Beltway]] between the interchanges Cologne East and Heumar.\n\n===Cycling===\n[[File:4517Bensberg.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cologne Stadtbahn]] at [[Bensberg (KVB)|Bensberg station]]]]\n[[File:146 019-5 Rheinexpressinkoelnhbf.jpg|thumb|right|Train at [[K\u00f6ln Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n\nCompared to other German cities, Cologne has a traffic layout that is not very [[bicycle-friendly]].

It is vegetarian or vegan, and it is based on the Dharmic concept of [[ahimsa]] (non-violence). Vegetarianism is common in other Dharmic faiths such as [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], as well as East Asian religions like [[Taoism]]. While [[Bhikkhu|monks]] and a minority of believers are vegetarian year-round, many believers follow the Buddhist vegetarian diet for celebrations.\n\nVegetarian cuisine is known as ''s\u00f9sh\u00ed'' (\u7d20\u98df) (\"vegetarian food\"), ''ch\u00fans\u00f9'' (\u7eaf\u7d20) (\"pure vegetarian\"), ''zh\u0101ic\u00e0i'' (\u658b\u83dc) (\"lent / fasting food\") in Mainland [[China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]; ''\u0111\u1ed3 chay'' in [[Vietnam]]; {{nihongo||\u7cbe\u9032\u6599\u7406|sh\u014djin ry\u014dri|devotion cuisine}} in [[Japan]]; ''sachal eumsik'' ({{lang|ko|\uc0ac\ucc30\uc74c\uc2dd}}\"temple food\") in [[Korea]]; ''jay (\u0e40\u0e08)'' in [[Thailand]] and by other names in many countries. The dishes that comprise Buddhist cuisine in any given place will be influenced by the general local cuisine.\n\nThe origin of \"Buddhist food\" as a distinct sub-style of cuisine is tied to [[monastery|monasteries]], where one member of the community would have the duty of being the head cook and supplying meals that paid respect to the strictures of Buddhist precepts. Temples that were open to visitors from the general public might also serve meals to them and a few temples effectively run functioning restaurants on the premises. In Japan, this practice is generally known as {{nihongo||\u7cbe\u9032\u6599\u7406|sh\u014djin ry\u014dri|devotion cuisine}}, and served at many temples, especially in [[Kyoto]]. A more recent version, more Chinese in style, is prepared by the [[\u014cbaku]] school of zen, and known as {{nihongo||\u666e\u8336\u6599\u7406|fucha ry\u014dri}}; this is served at the head temple of [[Manpuku-ji]], as well as various subtemples. In modern times, commercial restaurants have also latched on to the style, catering both to practicing and non-practicing lay people.\n\n==Philosophies governing food==\n\n=== Vegetarianism ===\n{{Main|Buddhist vegetarianism}}\n\nMost of the dishes considered to be uniquely Buddhist are vegetarian, but opinions and restrictions on the eating of meat, and whether it should be prohibited, vary among sects.\n\nWhen monks and nuns who follow the [[Theravada]]n way feed themselves by [[alms]], they must eat leftover foods which are given to them, including meat.<ref name=\"aboutbudd\">{{cite web |url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/basicbuddhistteachings/a/vegetarianism.htm |title=Buddhism and Vegetarianism |accessdate=June 9, 2012 |publisher=[[About.com]] }}</ref> (The Pali/Sanskrit term for monks and nuns means \"one who seeks alms\".) The exception to this alms rule is when monks and nuns have seen, heard or known that animal(s) have been specifically killed to feed the alms-seeker, in which case consumption of such meat would be [[karma|karmically]] negative.<ref name=\"aboutbudd\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma3/meat.html |title=What the Buddha Said About Eating Meat |accessdate=June 9, 2012  |publisher=Urban Dharma }}</ref> The same restriction is also followed by [[laity|lay]] Buddhists and is known as the consumption of the \"triply clean meat\" (\u4e09\u51c0\u8089).

This is based on teachings found in the [[Brahamajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahamajala Sutra]], the [[Surangama Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] (chapter eight). In modern times this rule is often interpreted to include other vegetables of the [[Allium|onion]] [[genus]], as well as [[coriander]]. The origins of this additional restriction is from the Indic region and can still be found among some believers of [[Hinduism]] and [[Jainism]]. Some Taoists also have this additional restriction but the list of restricted plants differs from the Buddhist list.<ref>It also includes coriander and a type of rabe plant.</ref>\n[[Image:Shojin ryori ryuanji.jpg|thumb|250px|left|An example of sh\u014djin-ry\u014dri taken in [[Kyoto]], Japan at the zen temple of [[Ry\u014dan-ji]].]] The food that a strict Buddhist takes, if not a vegetarian, is also specific. For many Chinese Buddhists beef and the consumption of large animals and exotic species is avoided. Then there would be the aforementioned \"triply clean meat\" rule. One restriction on food that is not known to many is the abstinence from eating animal innards and organs. This is known as ''xi\u00e0shui'' (\u4e0b\u6c34), not to be confused with the term for sewage.{{cn|date=January 2016}}\n\nAlcohol and other drugs are also avoided by many Buddhists because of their effects on the mind and \"[[mindfulness]]\". It is part of the Five Precepts which dictate that one is not to consume \"addictive materials\". The definition of \"addictive\" depends on each individual but most Buddhists consider alcohol, [[tobacco]] and drugs other than medicine to be addictive. Although [[caffeine]] is now also known to be addictive, caffeinated drinks and especially [[tea]] are not included under this restriction; tea in particular is considered to be healthful and beneficial and its mild stimulant effect desirable. There are many legends about tea. <!-- In the probably oldest legend a Chinese emperor adopted is first. --> Among meditators it is considered to keep the person alert and awake without overexcitement.\n\n===Simple and natural===\n\nIn theory and practice, many regional styles of cooking may be adopted to be \"Buddhist\" as long as the cook, with the above restrictions in mind, prepares the food, generally in simple preparations, with expert attention to its quality, wholesomeness and flavor. Often working on a tight budget, the monastery cook would have to make the most of whatever ingredients were available.\n\nIn ''[[Tenzo kyokun]]'' (\"Instructions for the Zen Cook\"), [[Soto Zen]] founder [[Eihei Dogen]] wrote the following about the Zen attitude toward food:\n\n<blockquote>In preparing food, it is essential to be sincere and to respect each ingredient regardless of how coarse or fine it is. (...) A rich buttery soup is not better as such than a broth of wild herbs. In handling and preparing wild herbs, do so as you would the ingredients for a rich feast, wholeheartedly, sincerely, clearly. When you serve the monastic assembly, they and you should taste only the flavour of the Ocean of Reality, the Ocean of unobscured Awake Awareness, not whether or not the soup is creamy or made only of wild herbs. In nourishing the seeds of living in the Way, rich food and wild grass are not separate.\"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wwzc.org/book/tenzo-kyokun-instructions-tenzo-0 | title = Tenzo kyokun: Instructions for the Tenzo - White Wind Zen Community | accessdate = 2012-10-15}}</ref>\"</blockquote>\n\n== Ingredients ==\n[[File:Saigon Vegetarian food.jpg|thumb|Vegetarian dishes at a Buddhist restaurant in Ho Chi Minh city]]\n\nFollowing its dominant status in most parts of East Asia where Buddhism is most practiced, [[rice]] features heavily in as a staple in the Buddhist meal, especially in the form of rice porridge or [[congee]] as the usual morning meal. [[Noodle]]s and other grains may often be served as well.  Vegetables of all sorts are generally either stir-fried or cooked in vegetarian broth with seasonings and may be eaten with various sauces. Traditionally eggs and dairy are not permitted. Seasonings will be informed by whatever is common in the local region; for example, [[soy sauce]] and vegan [[dashi]] figure strongly in Japanese monastery food while [[curry]] and [[T\u01b0\u01a1ng]] (as a vegetarian replacement for fish sauce) may be prominent in Southeast Asia. Sweets and desserts are not often consumed, but are permitted in moderation and may be served at special occasions such as in the context of a [[tea ceremony]] in the Zen tradition.\n\nBuddhist vegetarian chefs have become extremely creative in imitating meat using prepared [[wheat gluten (food)|wheat gluten]], also known as seitan, kao fu (\u70e4\u9eb8) or wheat meat, [[soy]] (such as [[tofu]] or [[tempeh]]), [[agar]], [[konjac|konnyaku]] and other [[plant]] products.  Some of their recipes are the oldest and most-refined [[meat analogue]]s in the world.  Soy and wheat gluten are very versatile materials, because they can be manufactured into various shapes and textures, and they absorb flavorings (including, but not limited to, meat-like flavorings), while having very little flavor of their own.  With the proper [[seasoning]]s, they can mimic various kinds of meat quite closely.\n\nSome of these Buddhist vegetarian chefs are in the many [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[temple]]s which serve allium-free and mock-meat (also known as 'meat analogues') dishes to the monks and visitors (including non-Buddhists who often stay for a few hours or days, to Buddhists who are not monks, but staying overnight for anywhere up to weeks or months). Many Buddhist restaurants also serve vegetarian, vegan, non-alcoholic or allium-free dishes.\n\nSome Buddhists eat vegetarian on the 1st and 15th of the lunar calendar (lenten days), on Chinese New Year eve, and on saint and ancestral holy days.  To cater to this type of customer, as well as full-time vegetarians, the menu of a Buddhist vegetarian restaurant usually shows no difference from a typical Chinese or East Asian restaurant, except that in recipes originally made to contain meat, a soy chicken substitute might be served instead.\n\n== Variations by sect or region ==\n\nAccording to cookbooks published in English, formal monastery meals in the [[Zen]] tradition generally follow a pattern of [[\u014cry\u014dki|\"three bowls\"]] in descending size. The first and largest bowl is a grain-based dish such as rice, noodles or [[congee]]; the second contains the protein dish which is often some form of stew or soup; the third and smallest bowl is a vegetable dish or a salad.<ref name=\"FarreyO'Hara2000\">{{cite book|author1=Edward Farrey|author2=Nancy O'Hara|title=3 Bowls: Vegetarian Recipes from an American Zen Buddhist Monastery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAdXsNXVokoC|accessdate=14 October 2012|date=16 May 2000|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-395-97707-1|page=X}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Food}}\n* [[Buddha's delight]]\n<!--* [[Buddhist dietitian]]-->\n* [[Buddhist ethics]]\n* [[Buddhist vegetarianism]]\n* [[Cultural elements of Buddhism]]\n* [[Vegetarian cuisine]]\n* [[Vegetarianism and religion]]\n* [[Korean temple cuisine]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Buddhist cuisine}}\n* [http://www.shabkar.org Shabkar.org: Vegetarianism as a way of life for Buddhists]\n* [http://www.shabkar.org/download/pdf/Shojin_Ryori_Culinary_Fundamentals_in_Zen.pdf Shojin Ryori: Vegetarian Cooking]\n* [http://www.shabkar.org/scripture/tantras/index.htm Tantras on Buddhist food]\n* [http://www.shabkar.org/scripture/sutras/index.htm Sutras on vegetarianism]\n* [http://www.headcity.com/uptown/bigmouth/hungry/chinese/middle.html Return To The Middle Kingdom: Chinese Vegetarian Eating in East Asia]\n* [http://zecoow.com Toshio Tanahashi]\n* [http://vegetarian-china.info/ vegetarian-china.info]\n\n\n{{Buddhism topics}}\n{{Vegetarianism|state=expanded}}\n{{Diets}}\n{{cuisines}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Buddhist Cuisine}}\n[[Category:Buddhist cuisine| ]]\n[[Category:Buddhist culture]]\n[[Category:Buddhist vegetarianism]]\n[[Category:Buddhism in China]]\n[[Category:Regional cuisines of China]]", "sha1": "n0uxxxtnqsdnbpzleaz23709mrk72tm"}}, {"title": "Chinese five spice", "ns": "0", "id": "6190", "redirect": {"title": "Five-spice powder"}, "revision": {"id": "15904349", "parentid": "7523220", "timestamp": "2004-11-16T14:19:08Z", "contributor": {"username": "Chameleon", "id": "50881"}, "minor": "", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Five-spice powder]]", "sha1": "mm7uc6qa9ju9ntp7cdh4bp1l1v8974v"}}, {"title": "Charles V", "ns": "0", "id": "6191", "revision": {"id": "833357428", "parentid": "827842460", "timestamp": "2018-03-31T02:08:33Z", "contributor": {"username": "Vmavanti", "id": "25128382"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Cleanup per [[WP:MOSDAB]] using [[tools:~dispenser/cgi-bin/dabfix.py|Dabfix]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Carlos V|the candy bar|Carlos V (chocolate bar)}}\n'''Charles V''' may refer to:\n\n* [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1500\u20131558)\n* [[Charles V of Naples]] (1661\u20131700), better known as Charles II of Spain\n* [[Charles V of France]] (1338\u20131380), called the Wise\n* [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine]] (1643\u20131690)\n* [[Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina]] (1788\u20131855), first Carlist pretender to the throne of Spain (as Charles V)\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Karl V]]'', a 1938 opera by Ernst Krenek\n* [[King Charles (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Charles]]\n\n{{hndis|Charles V}}\n\n[[eo:Karolo (regantoj)#Karolo la 5-a]]", "sha1": "du090msvzq5t24qjfnajnte8mu9wjvc"}}, {"title": "Constantin von Tischendorf", "ns": "0", "id": "6193", "revision": {"id": "862850929", "parentid": "862850696", "timestamp": "2018-10-07T03:38:03Z", "contributor": {"username": "Jay Schro", "id": "25823682"}, "comment": "/* The Codex Sinaiticus */Added potential reference", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox scientist\n| name              = Constantin von Tischendorf\n| image             = [[File:Tischendorf um 1870.jpg]]\n| image_size         = 150px\n| caption           = Constantin von Tischendorf, around 1870\n| birth_date        = {{birth date|df=yes|1815|01|18}}\n| birth_place       = [[Lengenfeld]], [[Kingdom of Saxony]]\n| death_date        = {{death date and age|df=yes|1874|12|07|1815|01|18}}\n| death_place       = [[Leipzig]], [[Saxony]], [[German Empire]]\n| nationality       = [[German people|German]]\n| field             = theology\n| religion          =\n}}\n\n'''Lobegott Friedrich Constantin (von) Tischendorf''' (18 January 1815 &ndash; 7 December 1874) was a world-leading [[biblical]] scholar in his time.

Experience the oldest Bible]</ref>\n\n== Tischendorf's motivation ==\n\nThroughout his life Tischendorf sought old biblical manuscripts, as he saw it as his task to give theology a Greek New Testament which was based on the oldest possible scriptures. He intended to be as close as possible to the original sources. Tischendorf's greatest discovery was in the monastery of Saint Catherine on the [[Sinai Peninsula]], which he visited in May 1844, and again in 1853 and 1859 (as Russian envoy).\n\nIn 1862 Tischendorf published the text of the Codex Sinaiticus for the 1000th Anniversary of the Russian Monarchy in both an illustrious four-volume facsimile edition and in a less costly text edition, to enable all scholars to have access to the Codex.\n\nTischendorf pursued a constant course of editorial labours, mainly on the New Testament, until he was broken down by overwork in 1873. His motive, as explained in a publication on Tischendorf's Letter by Prof. Christfried Boettrich (Leibzig University, Prof. of Theology), was to prove scientifically that the words of the Bible were trustfully transmitted over centuries.<ref>[[:de:Christfried B\u00f6ttrich]]</ref>\n\n==Life==\n[[File:Codex Sinaiticus Petropolitanus (title).JPG|thumb|right|220px|Title page from facsimile edition of codex Sinaiticus]]\n\nTischendorf was born in [[Lengenfeld]], [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]], near [[Plauen]], the son of a physician. Beginning in 1834, he spent his scholarly career at the [[University of Leipzig]] where he was mainly influenced by [[Georg Benedikt Winer|JGB Winer]], and he began to take special interest in [[New Testament]] [[textual criticism|criticism]]. Winer's influence gave him the desire to use the oldest manuscripts in order to compile the text of the New Testament as close to the original as possible.<ref>Panning, Armin J. [http://www.wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf Home Tischendorf and the History of the Greek New Testament Text] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130095538/http://wlsessays.net/files/PanningTischendorf.pdf |date=2010-11-30 }}, Milwaukee: Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly, 2008.</ref> In 1838 he took the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, then became master at a school near [[Leipzig]].\n\nAfter a journey through southern Germany and [[Switzerland]], and a visit to [[Strassburg]], he returned to Leipzig, and set to work upon a critical study of the New Testament text. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a dissertation on the [[recension]]s of the New Testament text \u2014 the main part of which reappeared the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the Greek New Testament. His critical apparatus included variant readings from earlier scholars \u2014 [[Elsevier]], [[Georg Christian Knapp]], [[Johann Martin Augustin Scholz]], and as recent as [[Karl Lachmann]] \u2014 whereby his researches were emboldened to depart from the [[received text]] as used in churches.\n\nThese early textual studies convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and more exact [[collation]]s of manuscripts. From October 1840 until January 1843 he was in Paris, busy with the treasures of the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France|Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], eking out his scanty means by making collations for other scholars, and producing for the publisher, [[Firmin Didot]], several editions of the Greek New Testament \u2014 one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the [[Vulgate]]. His second edition retracted the more precarious readings of the first, and included a statement of critical principles that is a landmark for evolving critical studies of Biblical texts.<ref name = \"Bible Researcher\">[http://www.bible-researcher.com/bib-t.html Bible Researcher].</ref>\n\nA great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the [[palimpsest]] ''[[Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus|Codex Ephraemi Syri Rescriptus]]'', of which the New Testament part was printed before he left Paris, and the [[Old Testament]] in 1845. His success in dealing with a manuscript that, having been over-written with other works of [[Ephrem the Syrian]], had been mostly illegible to earlier collators, made him more well known, and gained support for more extended critical expeditions. He now became ''professor extraordinarius'' at Leipzig, and where he was married in 1845. He also began to publish ''Reise in den Orient'', an account of his travels in the east (in 2 vols., 1845\u201346, translated as ''Travels in the East'' in 1847). Even though he was an expert in reading the text of a palimpsest (this is a document where the original writing has been removed and new writing added), he was not able to identify the value or meaning of the \"Archimedes Palimpsest\", which he donated to Cambridge.\n\nFrom Paris, he had paid short visits to the [[Netherlands]] (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months, went on to [[Egypt]], [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]], and the [[Levant]], returning via [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]].\n\n=== Discovery of the Codex Sinaiticus Bible manuscripts ===\n\nIn 1844 Tischendorf travelled the first time to [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] at the foot of [[Mount Sinai]] in Egypt, where he found the oldest complete known Bible. Of the many pages which were contained in an old wicker basket (the kind that the monastery hauled in its visitors as customary in unsafe territories) he was given 43 pages as a present. He donated those 43 pages to King [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]] (reigned 1836-1854), to honour him and to recognise his patronage as the funder of Tischenforf's journey. (Tischendorf held a position as Theological Professor at [[Leipzig University]], also under the patronage of Frederick Augustus II.) Leipzig University put 2 of the leaves on display in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tischendorf- Search for the oldest Bible of the world|url= http://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/tischendorf/home.html|publisher=University Leipzig}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1= Kholodiuk|first1= Anatoly|title= Tischendorf in search of the oldest Bible of the world - Leibzig Exhibition 2011|url=http://www.pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|website=pravoslavie.ru/english/44856.htm|publisher=Pravoslavie|accessdate=26 July 2014}}</ref>\nTischendorf reported in his 1865 book ''Wann Wurden Unsere Evangelen Verfasst'', translated to English in 1866 as  ''When Were Our Gospels Written'' in the section \"The Discovery of the Sinaitic Manuscript\" that he found, in a trash basket, forty-three sheets of parchment of an ancient copy of the Greek Old Testament, reporting that the monks were using the trash to start fires. And Tischendorf, horrified, asked if he could have them. He deposited them at the [[Leipzig University Library|University of Leipzig]], under the title of the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus|Codex Friderico-Augustanus]]'', a name given in honour of his patron, [[Frederick Augustus II of Saxony]], king of Saxony. The fragments were published in 1846, although Tischendorf kept the place of discovery a secret.\n\nMany have expressed skepticism at the historical accuracy of this report of saving a 1500-year-old parchment from the flames. [[J. Rendel Harris]] referred to the story as a ''myth''.<ref>\"What a run this myth has had, of a convent stove fed with parchment! unhappily for the statement, the basket is still there, a regular part of the library furniture, and not a suggestion can be found that it was ever used to carry vellum books to the kitchen for burning. But any story will be believed against the Sinaitic monks, even that they made fires with parchment.\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=u6gQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA140 Dr Gregory and the Canon and Text of the New Testament, ''Expositor'', 1908, p. 140]</ref> The Tischendorf Lesebuch (see References) quotes that the Librarian Kyrillos mentioned to Tischendorf that the contents of the basket had already twice been submitted to the fire. The contents of the baskets were damaged scriptures, the third filling apparently, so cited by Tischendorf himself.[see Tischendorf Lesebuch, Tischendorf's own account]. \nIn 1853 Tischendorf made a second trip to the Syrian monastery but made no new discoveries. He returned a third time in January 1859 under the patronage of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] with the active aid of the Russian government to find more of the ''Codex Frederico-Augustanus'' or similar ancient Biblical texts. On February 4, the last day of his visit, he was shown a text which he recognized as significant \u2014 the ''[[Codex Sinaiticus]]'' \u2014 a Greek manuscript of the complete New Testament and parts of the Old Testament dating to the 4th century.\n\nTischendorf persuaded the monks to present the manuscript to [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]], at the cost of the Tsar it was published in 1862 (in four folio volumes). Those{{who|date=November 2014}} ignorant of the details of his discovery of the ''Codex Sinaiticus'' accused Tischendorf of buying manuscripts from ignorant [[monastery]] librarians at low prices. Indeed, he was never rich, but he staunchly defended the rights of the monks at Saint Catherine's Monastery when he persuaded them eventually to send the manuscript to the Tsar. This took approximately 10 years because the abbot of St Catherines had to be re-elected and confirmed in office in Cairo and in Jerusalem, and during those 10 years no one in the monastery had the authority to hand over any documents. However the documents were handed over in due course following a signed and sealed letter to the Tsar Alexander II (Schenkungsurkunde). Even so, the monks of Mt. Sinai still display a receipt-letter from Tischendorf promising to return the manuscript to them in the case that the donation can not be done. This token-letter had to be destroyed, following the late issue of a \"Schenkungsurkunde\". This donation act regulated the Codex exchange with the Tsar, against 9000 Rubels and Rumanian estate protection. The Tsar was seen as the protector of Greek-Orthodox Christians. Thought lost since the Russian revolution, the document (Schenkungsurkunde) has now resurfaced in St Petersburg 2003, and has also been long before commented upon by other scholars like Kurt Aland. The monastery has disputed the existence of the gift certificate (Schenkungsurkunde) since the British Library was named as the new owner of the Codex. Now following the late find of the gift certificate by the [[National Library of Russia|National Russian Library]] the existence cannot be disputed in earnest.<ref name=\"nlr.ru\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nlr.ru/eng/exib/CodexSinaiticus/zah/|title=A.V.

Supporting the production of the facsimile, all made with special print characters for each of the 4 scribes of the Codex Sinaiticus, was shift work and contributed to Tischendorf's early demise due to exhausting work for months also during nights. Thus the Codex found its way to the Imperial Library at St. Petersburg.<ref name=\"nlr.ru\"/>\n\nWhen the 4-volume luxury edition of the Sinai Bible was completed in 1862, C. Tischendorf presented the original ancient manuscript to Emperor Alexander II. Meanwhile, the question of transferring the manuscript to the full possession of the Russian Sovereign remained unresolved for some years. In 1869, the new Archbishop of Sinai, Callistratus, and the monastic community, signed the official certificate presenting the manuscript to the Tsar. The Russian Government, in turn, bestowed the Monastery with 9000 rubles and decorated the Archbishop and some of the brethren with orders. In 1933 the Soviet Government sold the Codex Sinaiticus for 100,000 pounds to the [[British Museum]] in London, England.

Preparations critical in many ways''), containing [[wiktionary:canon|canon]]s of criticism, adding examples of their application that are applicable to students today:\n\n<blockquote>Basic rule: \"The text is only to be sought from ancient evidence, and especially from Greek manuscripts, but without neglecting the testimonies of versions and [[Fathers of the Church|fathers]].\"\n#\"A reading altogether peculiar to one or another ancient document is suspicious; as also is any, even if supported by a class of documents, which seems to evince that it has originated in the revision of a learned man.\"\n#\"Readings, however well supported by evidence, are to be rejected, when it is manifest (or very probable) that they have proceeded from the errors of copyists.\"\n#\"In parallel passages, whether of the New or Old Testament, especially in the [[Synoptic Gospels]], which ancient copyists continually brought into increased accordance, those testimonies are preferable, in which precise accordance of such parallel passages is not found; unless, indeed, there are important reasons to the contrary.\"\n#\"In discrepant readings, that should be preferred which may have given occasion to the rest, or which appears to comprise the elements of the others.\"\n#\"Those readings must be maintained which accord with [[Koine Greek|New Testament Greek]], or with the particular style of each individual writer.\"<ref name = \"Bible Researcher\" />\n</blockquote>\n\nThese were partly the result of the tireless travels he had begun in 1839 in search of unread manuscripts of the New Testament, \"to clear up in this way,\" he wrote, \"the history of the sacred text, and to recover if possible the genuine [[Twelve apostles|apostolic]] text which is the foundation of our faith.\"\n\nIn 1850 appeared his edition of the ''[[Codex Amiatinus]]'' (in 1854 corrected)<ref>Constantinus Tischendorf, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&id=x0opAAAAYAAJ&q=NOVUM_TESTAMENTUM_LATINE#v= ''Codex Amiatinus. Novum Testamentum Latine interpreter Hieronymo''], (Lipsiae 1854).</ref> and of the [[Septuagint]] version of the Old Testament (7th ed., 1887); in 1852, amongst other works, his edition of the ''[[Codex Claromontanus]]''.\n\nMeanwhile, also in 1859, he had been made ''professor ordinarius'' of theology and of Biblical [[paleography]], this latter professorship being specially created for him; and another book of travel, ''Aus dem heiligen Lande'', appeared in 1862. Tischendorf's Eastern journeys were rich enough in other discoveries to merit the highest praise.\n\nBesides his fame as a scholar, he was a friend of both [[Robert Schumann]], with whom he corresponded, and [[Felix Mendelssohn]], who dedicated a song to him. His text critical colleague [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]] wrote warmly of their mutual interest in textual scholarship. His personal library, purchased after his death, eventually came to the [[University of Glasgow]],<ref name = \"Univ Glasgow\">[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/collection/tischendorf.html Tischendorf] at the [[University of Glasgow]], Scotland.</ref> where a commemorative exhibition of books from his library was held in 1974 and can be accessed by the public.\n\nHe died in [[Leipzig]].\n\n==Works==\n[[File:Codex Ephraemi Mt 26,52-69.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Matthew 26:52-69 in Tischendorf's facsimile edition (1843)]]\nHis ''magnum opus'' was the \"Critical Edition of the New Testament.\"\n\nThe great edition, of which the text and apparatus appeared in 1869 and 1872, was called by himself ''editio viii''; but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one, if mere reprints from [[stereotype]] plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are included; posthumous prints bring the total to forty-one. Four main recensions of Tischendorf's text may be distinguished, dating respectively from his editions of 1841, 1849, 1859 (ed. vii), and 1869\u201372 (ed. viii). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important, from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished from Tischendorf's other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the eighth edition, the testimony of the Sinaitic manuscript received great (probably too great) weight. The readings of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] manuscript were given with more exactness and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had also the advantage of using the published labours of his colleague and friend [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles]].\n\nOf relatively lesser importance was Tischendorf's work on the Greek Old Testament. His edition of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian manuscript, the ''[[Codex Ephraemi]]'', and the ''Friderico-Augustanus'', was of service when it appeared in 1850, but, being stereotyped, was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections, even within the limited field it covers, may be judged by the aid of [[Eberhard Nestle]]'s appendix to the 6th issue (1880).\n\nBesides this may be mentioned editions of the [[New Testament apocrypha]], ''De Evangeliorum apocryphorum origine et usu'' (1851); ''Acta Apostolorum apocrypha'' (1851); ''Evangelia apocrypha'' (1853; 2nd ed., 1876); ''Apocalypses apocryphae'' (1866), and various minor writings, partly of an apologetic character, such as ''Wann wurden unsere Evangelien verfasst?'' (''When Were Our Gospels Written?''; 1865; 4th ed., 1866, digitized by Google and available for e-readers), ''Haben wir den echten Schrifttext der Evangelisten und Apostel?'' (1873), and ''Synopsis evangelica'' (7th ed., 1898).\n\n; Facsimile of manuscripts\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=wWFAAAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false ''Codex Ephraemi Syri rescriptus, sive Fragmenta Novi Testamenti''], Lipsiae 1843\n* [https://archive.org/stream/Tischendorf.V.Various/01.CodexEphraemiSyriRescriptus.FragUtriusqTest.1845.#page/n9/mode/2up ''Codex Ephraemi Syri rescriptus, sive Fragmenta Veteris Testamenti''], Lipsiae 1845\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=1CFMAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=#v=onepage&q&f=false Notitia editionis codicis Bibliorum Sinaitici] (Leipzig 1860)\n* [https://archive.org/stream/Tischendorf.V.Various/04.AnecdotaSacraProfanaOrientOccidentNotitiaCodex..v1.Tischendorf.1861.#page/n7/mode/2up ''Anecdota sacra et profana''] (Leipzig 1861)\n\n; Editions of Novum Testamentum Graece\n* [https://archive.org/stream/hkaindiathknovu00tiscgoog#page/n5/mode/2up ''Novum Testamentum Graece.

A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawyer from [[New England]], born in [[Vermont]], Coolidge worked his way up the ladder of [[Massachusetts]] state [[politics]], eventually becoming [[Governor of Massachusetts|governor]]. His response to the [[Boston Police Strike]] of 1919 thrust him into the national spotlight and gave him a reputation as a man of decisive action. Soon after, he was elected [[Vice President of the United States]] in 1920, and succeeded to the presidency upon the sudden death of [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1923. Elected in his own right in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]], he gained a reputation as a [[small government]] [[conservative]] and also as a man who said very little, although having a rather dry sense of humor.\n\nCoolidge restored public confidence in the [[White House]] after the [[Warren G.

He was the elder of the two children of [[John Calvin Coolidge Sr.]] (1845\u20131926) and Victoria Josephine Moor (1846\u20131885). Coolidge Senior engaged in many occupations and developed a statewide reputation as a prosperous farmer, storekeeper, and public servant. He held various local offices, including [[justice of the peace]] and tax collector and served in the Vermont House of Representatives as well as the Vermont Senate.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=22}} Coolidge's mother was the daughter of a Plymouth Notch farmer. She was chronically ill and died, perhaps from [[tuberculosis]], when Coolidge was twelve years old. His younger sister, Abigail Grace Coolidge (1875\u20131890), died at the age of fifteen, probably of appendicitis, when Coolidge was eighteen. Coolidge's father married a Plymouth schoolteacher in 1891, and lived to the age of eighty.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1p=17|McCoy|1967|2p=5|White|1938|3p=11}}\n\nCoolidge's family had deep roots in [[New England]]; his earliest American ancestor, John Coolidge, emigrated from [[Cottenham]], Cambridgeshire, England, around 1630 and settled in [[Watertown, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=12}} Another ancestor, [[Edmund Rice (1638)|Edmund Rice]], arrived at Watertown in 1638. Coolidge's great-great-grandfather, also named John Coolidge, was an American military officer in the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] and one of the first [[Board of Selectmen|selectmen]] of the town of Plymouth.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=7}} His grandfather [[Calvin Galusha Coolidge]] served in the Vermont House of Representatives.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=24}} Coolidge was also a descendant of [[Samuel Appleton (born 1625)|Samuel Appleton]], who settled in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts|Ipswich]] and led the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] during [[King Philip's War]].{{sfn|Roberts|1995|p=199}}\n\n==Early career and marriage==\n\n===Education and law practice===\n[[File:Prof. Charles E. Garman - Amherst College.jpg|thumb|upright|Amherst College Philosophy Dept. Picture|Professor [[Charles Edward Garman]]]]\n\nCoolidge attended [[Black River Academy]] and then [[St. Johnsbury Academy]], before enrolling at [[Amherst College]], where he distinguished himself in the debating class. As a senior he joined the fraternity [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and graduated ''cum laude''. While at Amherst Coolidge was profoundly influenced by philosophy professor [[Charles Edward Garman]], a [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational]] mystic, with a [[Neo-Hegelianism|neo-Hegelian]] philosophy.\n\nCoolidge explained Garman's ethics forty years later:\n<blockquote>[T]here is a standard of righteousness that might does not make right, that the end does not justify the means, and that expediency as a working principle is bound to fail. The only hope of perfecting human relationships is in accordance with the law of service under which men are not so solicitous about what they shall get as they are about what they shall give. Yet people are entitled to the rewards of their industry. What they earn is theirs, no matter how small or how great. But the possession of property carries the obligation to use it in a larger service...{{sfn|White|1938|pp=43\u201344}}</blockquote>\n\nAt his father's urging after graduation, Coolidge moved to [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] to become a lawyer. To avoid the cost of [[law school]], Coolidge followed the common practice of apprenticing with a local law firm, Hammond & Field, and [[reading law]] with them. [[John C Hammond|John C. Hammond]] and Henry P. Field, both Amherst graduates, introduced Coolidge to law practice in the county seat of [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]]. In 1897, Coolidge was admitted to the Massachusetts bar, becoming a [[country lawyer]].{{sfn|Shlaes|2013|pp=66\u201368}} With his savings and a small inheritance from his grandfather, Coolidge opened his own law office in Northampton in 1898. He practiced commercial law, believing that he served his clients best by staying out of court. As his reputation as a hard-working and diligent attorney grew, local banks and other businesses began to retain his services.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=74\u201381|McCoy|1967|2pp=22\u201326}}\n\n===Marriage and family===\n[[File:Grace Coolidge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Grace Coolidge]]]]\nIn 1903, Coolidge met [[Grace Coolidge|Grace Anna Goodhue]], a [[University of Vermont]] graduate and teacher at Northampton's [[Clarke School for the Deaf]]. They married on October 4, 1905 at 2:30&nbsp;p.m. in a small ceremony which took place in the parlor of Grace's family's house, following a vain effort at postponement by Grace's mother; she was never enamored with Coolidge, nor he with her.{{sfn|Bryson|2013|p=187}} The newlyweds went on a honeymoon trip to Montreal, originally planned for two weeks but cut short by a week at Coolidge's request. After 25 years he wrote of Grace, \"for almost a quarter of a century she has borne with my infirmities and I have rejoiced in her graces\".{{sfn|White|1938|p=61}}\n\nThe Coolidges had two sons: [[John Coolidge|John]] (September 7, 1906 \u2013 May 31, 2000) and Calvin Jr. (April 13, 1908 \u2013 July 7, 1924). The death of Calvin Jr. at age 16 from blood poisoning brought on by an infected blister \"hurt [Coolidge] terribly,\" according to son John. John became a railroad executive, helped to start the Coolidge Foundation, and was instrumental in creating the [[President Calvin Coolidge State Historic Site]].{{sfn|Martin|2000|p=}}\n\nCoolidge was frugal, and when it came to securing a home, he insisted upon renting. Grace Coolidge was a member of Northampton's Edwards [[Congregational church|Congregational]] Church, but Coolidge never formally joined the congregation.{{sfn|Shlaes|2013|p=91}}\n\n==Local political office==\n\n===City offices===\nThe [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was dominant in New England at the time, and Coolidge followed the example of Hammond and Field by becoming active in local politics.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=49\u201351}} In 1896, Coolidge campaigned for Republican presidential candidate [[William McKinley]], and the next year he was selected to be a member of the Republican City Committee.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=51\u201353}} In 1898, he won election to the [[City Council]] of Northampton, placing second in a ward where the top three candidates were elected.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=49\u201351}} The position offered no salary but provided Coolidge invaluable political experience.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=83}} In 1899, he declined renomination, running instead for [[Solicitor#United States|City Solicitor]], a position elected by the City Council. He was elected for a one-year term in 1900, and reelected in 1901.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=84\u201385}} This position gave Coolidge more experience as a lawyer and paid a salary of $600 ({{Inflation|US|600|1901|fmt=eq}}).{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=84\u201385}} In 1902, the city council selected a Democrat for city solicitor, and Coolidge returned to private practice.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=29}} Soon thereafter, however, the [[Court clerk|clerk of courts]] for the county died, and Coolidge was chosen to replace him. The position paid well, but it barred him from practicing law, so he remained at the job for only one year.{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=29}} In 1904, Coolidge suffered his sole defeat at the ballot box, losing an election to the Northampton [[Board of Education|school board]]. When told that some of his neighbors voted against him because he had no children in the schools he would govern, Coolidge replied, \"Might give me time!\"{{sfn|McCoy|1967|p=29}}\n\n===State legislator and mayor===\nIn 1906, the local Republican committee nominated Coolidge for election to the state [[Massachusetts House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. He won a close victory over the incumbent Democrat, and reported to [[Boston]] for the 1907 session of the [[Massachusetts General Court]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=61}} In his freshman term, Coolidge served on minor committees and, although he usually voted with the party, was known as a [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Republican]], voting in favor of such measures as [[women's suffrage]] and the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|direct election of Senators]].{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=62|Fuess|1940|2p=99}} While in Boston, Coolidge became an ally, and then a liegeman, of then U.S. Senator [[Winthrop Murray Crane]] who controlled the western faction of the Massachusetts Republican Party; Crane's party rival in the east of the commonwealth was U.S. Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]].{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=63\u201366}} Coolidge forged another key strategic alliance with [[Guy Currier]], who had served in both state houses and had the social distinction, wealth, personal charm and broad circle of friends which Coolidge lacked, and which would have a lasting impact on his political career.{{sfn|White|1938|pp=99\u2013102}} In 1907, he was elected to a second term, and in the 1908 session Coolidge was more outspoken, though not in a leadership position.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|pp=68\u201369}}\n\nInstead of vying for another term in the [[Massachusetts State House|State House]], Coolidge returned home to his growing family and ran for [[mayor]] of Northampton when the incumbent Democrat retired.

While we should not refuse to spend and be spent in the service of our country, it is hazardous to attempt what we feel is beyond our strength to accomplish.\"{{sfn|Coolidge|1929|p=239}} After leaving office, he and Grace returned to Northampton, where he wrote his memoirs. The Republicans retained the White House in 1928 with a landslide by  [[Herbert Hoover]]. Coolidge had been reluctant to endorse Hoover as his successor; on one occasion he remarked that \"for six years that man has given me unsolicited advice\u2014all of it bad.\"{{sfn|Ferrell|1998|p=195}} Even so, Coolidge had no desire to split the party by publicly opposing the nomination of the popular commerce secretary.{{sfn|Clemens| Daggett|1945|p=147-63}}\n\n===Cabinet===\n[[File:Coolidge Cabinet.jpg|thumb|Coolidge's cabinet in 1924, outside the [[White House]]<br />Front row, left to right: [[Harry Stewart New]], [[John W.

Wallace]], [[Herbert Hoover]], [[Hubert Work]]]]\nAlthough a few of Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge initially retained all of them, out of an ardent conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election. He kept Harding's able speechwriter [[Judson T. Welliver]]; Stuart Crawford replaced Welliver in November 1925.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=48\u201349}} Coolidge appointed [[C. Bascom Slemp]], a [[Virginia]] Congressman and experienced federal politician, to work jointly with Edward T. Clark, a Massachusetts Republican organizer whom he retained from his vice-presidential staff, as [[Secretary to the President (United States)|Secretaries to the President]] (a position equivalent to the modern [[White House Chief of Staff]]).{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=320\u201322}}\n\nPerhaps the most powerful person in Coolidge's Cabinet was Secretary of the Treasury [[Andrew Mellon]], who controlled the administration's financial policies and was regarded by many, including House Minority Leader [[John Nance Garner]], as more powerful than Coolidge himself.{{sfn|Rusnak|1983|pp=270\u201371}} Secretary of Commerce [[Herbert Hoover]] also held a prominent place in Coolidge's Cabinet, in part because Coolidge found value in Hoover's ability to win positive publicity with his pro-business proposals.{{sfn|Polsky|Tkacheva|2002|pp=224\u201327}} Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] directed Coolidge's foreign policy until he resigned in 1925 following Coolidge's re-election. He was replaced by [[Frank B. Kellogg]], who had previously served as a Senator and as the ambassador to Great Britain. Coolidge made two other appointments following his re-election, with [[William M. Jardine]] taking the position of Secretary of Agriculture and [[John G. Sargent]] becoming Attorney General.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=111\u201312}} Coolidge did not have a vice president during his first term, but [[Charles Dawes]] became vice president during Coolidge's second term, and Dawes and Coolidge clashed over farm policy and other issues.{{sfn|Senate Historian|2014|p=}}\n\n===Judicial appointments===\n{{Main|List of federal judges appointed by Calvin Coolidge}}\n[[File:Chief Justice Harlan Fiske Stone photograph circa 1927-1932.jpg|thumb|upright|Coolidge appointed [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] Attorney General and then Supreme Court Justice]]\n\nCoolidge appointed one justice to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], [[Harlan Fiske Stone]] in 1925. Stone was Coolidge's fellow Amherst alumnus, a Wall Street lawyer and conservative Republican. Stone was serving as dean of [[Columbia Law School]] when Coolidge appointed him to be attorney general in 1924 to restore the reputation tarnished by Harding's Attorney General, [[Harry M. Daugherty]].{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=364}} It does not appear that Coolidge considered appointing anyone other than Stone, although Stone himself had urged Coolidge to appoint [[Benjamin N. Cardozo]].{{sfn| Handler |1995|pp=113\u2013122}} Stone proved to be a firm believer in [[judicial restraint]] and was regarded as one of the court's [[The Three Musketeers (Supreme Court)|three liberal justices]] who would often vote to uphold New Deal legislation.{{sfn|Galston|loc=''passim''}} President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] later appointed Stone to be chief justice.\n\nCoolidge nominated 17 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 61 judges to the [[United States district courts]]. He appointed judges to various specialty courts as well, including [[Genevieve R. Cline]], who became the first woman named to the federal judiciary when Coolidge placed her on the [[United States Customs Court]] in 1928.{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=216}} Coolidge also signed the [[Judiciary Act of 1925]] into law, allowing the Supreme Court more discretion over its workload.\n\n==Retirement and death==\n[[File:Coolidge public address.jpg|thumb|right|Coolidge addressing a crowd at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]'s Roman style [[Arlington Memorial Amphitheater|Memorial Amphitheater]] in 1924.]]\nAfter his presidency, Coolidge retired to the modest rented house on residential Massasoit Street in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] before moving to a more spacious home, \"The Beeches.\"{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=407}} He kept a [[Hacker-Craft|Hacker]] runabout boat on the Connecticut River and was often observed on the water by local boating enthusiasts. During this period, he also served as chairman of the Non-Partisan Railroad Commission, an entity created by several banks and corporations to survey the country's long-term transportation needs and make recommendations for improvements.  He was the honorary president of the [[American Foundation for the Blind]], a director of [[New York Life Insurance Company]], president of the [[American Antiquarian Society]], and a trustee of Amherst College.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|pp=450\u201355}}\n\nCoolidge published [[The Autobiography of Calvin Coolidge|his autobiography]] in 1929 and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, \"Calvin Coolidge Says,\" from 1930 to 1931.{{sfnm|Sobel|1998a|1p=403|Ferrell|1998|2pp=201\u201302}} Faced with looming defeat in the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 presidential election]], some Republicans spoke of rejecting Herbert Hoover as their party's nominee, and instead drafting Coolidge to run, but the former president made it clear that he was not interested in running again, and that he would publicly repudiate any effort to draft him, should it come about.{{sfnm|Fuess|1940|1pp=457\u201359|Greenberg|2006|2p=153}} Hoover was renominated, and Coolidge made several radio addresses in support of him. Hoover then lost the general election to Coolidge's 1920 vice presidential Democratic opponent [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in a landslide.{{sfn|Fuess|1940|p=460}}\n\n{{anchor|Death}}\nCoolidge died suddenly from [[coronary thrombosis]] at \"The Beeches,\" at 12:45&nbsp;p.m., January 5, 1933.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|pp=154\u201355}} Shortly before his death, Coolidge confided to an old friend: \"I feel I no longer fit in with these times.\"{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=410}} Coolidge is buried in [[Plymouth Notch Cemetery]], [[Plymouth Notch]], Vermont. The nearby family home is maintained as one of the original buildings on the [[Calvin Coolidge Homestead District]] site. The State of Vermont dedicated a new visitors' center nearby to mark Coolidge's 100th birthday on July 4, 1972.\n\n==Radio, film, and commemorations==\n[[File:Coolidge with press.jpg|upright|thumb|Coolidge, reporters, and cameramen]]\nDespite his reputation as a quiet and even reclusive politician, Coolidge made use of the new medium of radio and made radio history several times while president. He made himself available to reporters, giving 520 press conferences, meeting with reporters more regularly than any president before or since.{{sfn|Greenberg|2006|p=7}} Coolidge's [[Second inauguration of Calvin Coolidge|second inauguration]] was the first presidential inauguration broadcast on radio. On December 6, 1923, he was the first president whose address to Congress was broadcast on radio.{{sfn|Sobel|1998a|p=252}} Coolidge signed the [[Radio Act of 1927]], which assigned regulation of radio to the newly created [[Federal Radio Commission]]. On August 11, 1924, [[Theodore W. Case]], using the [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process he developed for [[Lee DeForest]], filmed Coolidge on the White House lawn, making Coolidge the first president to appear in a sound film. The title of the DeForest film was ''President Coolidge, Taken on the White House Grounds''.{{sfn|de Forest|1924|p=}} When [[Charles Lindbergh]] arrived in Washington on a U.S. Navy ship after his celebrated 1927 trans-Atlantic flight, President Coolidge welcomed him back to the U.S. and a sound-on-film record of the event exists.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Sesquicentennial american independence half dollar commemorative obverse.jpg|Coolidge was the only president to have his portrait on a coin during his lifetime, the [[United States Sesquicentennial coinage|Sesquicentennial of American Independence Half Dollar]], minted in 1926.\nFile:Calvin Coolidge 1938 Issue-$5.jpg|Coolidge on a 1938 postage stamp\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* {{Portal inline|size=tiny|Calvin Coolidge}}\n* {{SS|President Coolidge}}\n* [[Coolidge, Arizona]]\n* [[Coolidge Dam]]\n* [[Coolidge effect]]\n* [[List of Presidents of the United States]]\n* [[List of Presidents of the United States, sortable by previous experience]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notes|colwidth=35em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|15em}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{external media| float = right| video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?310540-1/amity-shlaes ''Q&A'' interview with Amity Shlaes on ''Coolidge'', February 10, 2013], [[C-SPAN]]| video2 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?110049-1/coolidge-american-enigma ''Booknotes'' interview with Robert Sobel on ''Coolidge: An American Enigma'', August 30, 1998], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n\n===About Coolidge and his era===\n* {{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/138860690/|title=Confirms Daugherty's Story of Coolidge's Second Oath|last=Associated Press|first=|date=February 2, 1932|work=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|access-date=2018-05-31|publication-place=St. Louis, Missouri|page=1C|language=en|ref={{sfnRef|\"Confirms Daugherty's Story of Coolidge's Second Oath\"}}}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Barry |first=John M. |authorlink=John M.

The Convention has three main goals including: the conservation of biological diversity (or [[biodiversity]]); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from [[Germplasm|genetic resource]]s.\n\nIn other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It is often seen as the key document regarding [[sustainable development]]. The Convention was opened for signature at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. At the 2010 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October in [[Nagoya]], Japan, the Nagoya Protocol was adopted.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.cbd.int/cop10/ Welcome to COP 10<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Origin and scope==\n\nThe notion of an international convention on bio-diversity was conceived at a [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities.\nIn 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the convention's text.<ref name=\"CBDweb01\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/history/|title=History of the Convention|work=Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD)|accessdate= 14 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nA Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the [[Nairobi Final Act]].<ref name=\"nairAct\">[https://www.cbd.int/doc/handbook/cbd-hb-09-en.pdf Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the adoption of the agreed text of the Convention on Biological Diversity], Heinrich, M. (2002). Handbook of the Convention on Biological Diversity: Edited by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Earthscan, London, 2001. {{ISBN|9781853837371}}</ref> The Convention's text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio \"Earth Summit\"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.<ref name=\"CBDweb01\" />\n\nThe convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biodiversity is \"a common concern of humankind\" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all [[ecosystem]]s, [[species]], and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use.<ref>Louafi, S\u00e9lim and Jean-Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Morin, International governance of biodiversity: Involving all the users of genetic resources, IDDRI, 2004, https://www.academia.edu/3809935/Louafi_S._and_J-F_Morin_2004_International_Governance_of_biodiversity_Involving_all_the_Users_of_Genetic_Resources_Les_synth%C3%A8ses_de_lIddri_n_5._4_p</ref> It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and [[biosafety]] issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.\n\nThe convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of [[sustainable use]]. While past [[conservation biology|conservation]] efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.\n\nThe convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the [[precautionary principle]] which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.\n\nThe Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].\n\n==Issues==\n{{ref section|date=February 2017}}\n\nSome of the many issues dealt with under the convention include:\n\n* Measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.\n* Regulated access to genetic resources and [[traditional knowledge]], including Prior Informed Consent of the party providing resources.\n* Sharing, in a fair and equitable way, the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of [[Genetics|genetic]] resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources (governments and/or local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized).\n* Access to and transfer of technology, including [[biotechnology]], to the governments and/or local communities that provided traditional knowledge and/or biodiversity resources.\n* Technical and scientific cooperation.\n* Coordination of a global directory of taxonomic expertise (Global Taxonomy Initiative).\n* Impact assessment.\n* Education and public [[awareness]].\n* Provision of financial resources.\n* National reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments.\n\n==Cartagena Protocol==\n{{ref section|date=February 2017}}\n\n{{main|Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety}}\nThe '''Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety''' of the Convention, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.\n\nThe Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the [[precautionary principle]] and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a [[genetically modified organism]] if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is [[safe]] and requires exporters to label shipments containing [[genetically modified]] commodities such as corn or cotton.\n\nThe required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.\n\n== Global Strategy for Plant Conservation ==\n{{ref section|date=February 2017}}\n\n{{main|Global Strategy for Plant Conservation}}\n\nIn April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.\n\n==Parties==\nAs of 2016, the Convention has 196 parties, which includes 195 states and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|title=CBD List of Parties}}</ref> All UN member states\u2014with the exception of the United States\u2014have ratified the treaty.

The US has signed but not ratified the treaty,<ref>{{cite news|title=India Presses U.S. to Pass Biotic Treaty|last=Hazarika|first=Sanjoy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 April 1995|page=1.13}}</ref> and has not announced plans to ratify it.\n\n==International bodies established==\n{{ref section|date=February 2017}}\n\n'''Conference of the parties:'''\nThe convention's governing body is the [[Conference of the parties]] (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.\n\nThe Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, two main organs are:\n\n'''Secretariat:'''\nThe CBD Secretariat, based in [[Montreal]], operates under the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.\n\n'''Subsidiary body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA):'''\nThe SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues.\n\nThe 13th Meeting of the SBSTTA, or SBSTTA-13, held from 18&ndash;22 February 2008 at the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] headquarters in Rome, Italy. SBSTTA-13 delegates finalized and adopted recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and forest biodiversity and SBSTTA's modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues, as well as on inland waters biodiversity, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] biodiversity, [[invasive alien species]], and biodiversity and [[climate change]].\n\nThe current chairperson of the SBSTTA is Dr. Theresa Mundita Lim of the [[Philippines]].\n\n==Country implementation==\n\n===National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)===\n\"National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level (Article 6). The Convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy (or equivalent instrument) and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity. To date [2012-02-01], 173 Parties have developed NBSAPs in line with Article 6.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/nbsap/|title= National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) }}</ref>\n\nFor example, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats.

(green) and ratifications (dark green) as of July 2007]]\n\nThe '''Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution''', often abbreviated as '''Air Pollution''' or '''CLRTAP''', is intended to protect the human environment against [[air pollution]] and to gradually reduce and prevent air pollution, including long-range transboundary air pollution. It is implemented by the [[European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme]] (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).\n\n==Overview==\nThe convention opened for signature on 1979-11-13 and entered into force on 1983-03-16.\n\nThe Convention, which now has 51 Parties, identifies the Executive Secretary of the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) as its secretariat. The current parties to the Convention are shown on the map.\n\nThe Convention is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) (short for ''Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe'').<ref>EMEP History and Structure, [http://www.emep.int/index.html EMEP website]</ref> Results of the EMEP programme are published on the EMEP website, [http://www.emep.int/ www.emep.int].\n\nSince 1979 the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution has addressed some of the major environmental problems of the UNECE region through scientific collaboration and policy negotiation. The Convention has been extended by eight protocols that identify specific measures to be taken by Parties to cut their emissions of air pollutants:\n\n* Protocol on Long-Term Financing of the Cooperative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP) (1984)\n* [[1985 Helsinki Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]]\n* [[Nitrogen Oxide Protocol]] (1988)\n* [[Volatile Organic Compounds Protocol]] (1991)\n* [[1994 Oslo Protocol on Further Reduction of Sulphur Emissions]]\n* [[Protocol on Heavy Metals]] (1998)\n* [[Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants]] (1998)\n* [[Multi-effect Protocol|1999 Gothenburg Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone]] (1999)\n\nThe aim of the Convention is that Parties shall endeavour to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce and prevent air pollution including long-range transboundary air pollution. Parties develop policies and strategies to combat the discharge of air pollutants through exchanges of information, consultation, research and monitoring.\n\nThe Parties meet annually at sessions of the Executive Body to review ongoing work and plan future activities including a workplan for the coming year. The three main subsidiary bodies - the Working Group on Effects, the Steering Body to EMEP and the Working Group on Strategies and Review - as well as the Convention's Implementation Committee, report to the Executive Body each year.\n\nCurrently, the Convention's priority activities include review and possible revision of its most recent protocols, implementation of the Convention and its protocols across the entire UNECE region (with special focus on Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia and South-East Europe) and sharing its knowledge and information with other regions of the world.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Aarhus Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants]]\n* [[Protocol on Heavy Metals]]\n* [[Critical load]]\n* [[Environmental agreement]]s\n* [[Multi-effect

Species of Wild Fauna and Flora''', also known as the '''Washington Convention''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] to protect endangered plants and animals. It was drafted as a result of a resolution adopted in 1963 at a meeting of members of the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN). The convention was opened for signature in 1973 and CITES entered into force on 1 July 1975. Its aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten the survival of the species in the wild, and it accords varying degrees of protection to more than 35,000 [[species]] of animals and plants. In order to ensure that the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) was not violated, the Secretariat of GATT was consulted during the drafting process.<ref name=\"what_is_cites\">{{cite web|url= http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/what.php |title=What is CITES?|work=cites.org|publisher=CITES|accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{as of|2015}}, Secretary-General of the CITES Secretariat is [[John E. Scanlon]].\n\n== Background and operation ==\nCITES is one of the largest and oldest conservation and sustainable use agreements in existence. Participation is voluntary, and countries that have agreed to be bound by the Convention are known as Parties. Although CITES is legally binding on the Parties, it does not take the place of national laws. Rather it provides a framework respected by each Party, which must adopt their own domestic legislation to implement CITES at the national level.  Often, domestic legislation is either non-existent (especially in Parties that have not ratified it), or with penalties  with the gravity of the crime and insufficient deterrents to wildlife traders.<ref name=Zimmerman>{{cite web|url=http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|title=Zimmerman, \"The Black Market for Wildlife: llegal Wildlife Trade,\" ''Vanderbilt Journal of Transnational Law'' 36 (5) 1657-1689 (November 2003)|accessdate=23 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621160652/http://law.vanderbilt.edu/publications/journal-of-transnational-law/archives/volume-36-number-5/download.aspx?id=1907|archivedate=21 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As of 2002, 50% of Parties lacked one or more of the four major requirements for a Party: designation of Management and Scientific Authorities; laws prohibiting the trade in violation of CITES; penalties for such trade; laws providing for the confiscation of specimens.<ref name=Reeve>Reeve, Policing International Trade in Endangered Species: The CITES Treaty and agreement.  London: Earthscan, 2000.</ref>\n\nFunding for the activities of the Secretariat and Conference of the Parties (CoP) meetings comes from a Trust Fund derived from Party contributions.  Trust Fund money is not available to Parties to improve implementation or compliance. These activities, and all those outside Secretariat activities (training, species specific programmes such as Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants - MIKE) must find external funding, mostly from donor countries and regional organizations such as the European Union.\n\nAlthough the Convention itself does not provide for arbitration or dispute in the case of noncompliance, 36 years of CITES in practice has resulted in several strategies to deal with infractions by Parties. The Secretariat, when informed of an infraction by a Party, will notify all other parties. The Secretariat will give the Party time to respond to the allegations and may provide technical assistance to prevent further infractions. Other actions the Convention itself does not provide for but that derive from subsequent COP resolutions may be taken against the offending Party. These include:\n*Mandatory confirmation of all permits by the Secretariat\n*Suspension of cooperation from the Secretariat\n*A formal warning\n*A visit by the Secretariat to verify capacity\n*Recommendations to all Parties to suspend CITES related trade with the offending party<ref name=\"cites_suspend\">{{cite web |url= http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/ref/suspend.php|title=Countries currently subject to a recommendation to suspend trade|publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n*Dictation of corrective measures to be taken by the offending Party before the Secretariat will resume cooperation or recommend resumption of trade\nBilateral sanctions have been imposed on the basis of national legislation (e.g. the USA used certification under the Pelly Amendment to get Japan to revoke its reservation to hawksbill turtle products in 1991, thus reducing the volume of its exports).\n\nInfractions may include negligence with respect to permit issuing, excessive trade, lax enforcement, and  failing to produce annual reports (the most common).\n\nOriginally, CITES addressed depletion resulting from demand for luxury goods such as furs in Western countries, but with the rising wealth of Asia, particularly in China, the focus changed to products demanded there, particularly those used for luxury goods such as ivory or shark fins or for superstitious purposes such as rhinoceros horn. As of 2013 the demand was massive and had expanded to include thousands of species previously considered unremarkable and in no danger of extinction such as [[manta ray]]s or [[pangolin]]s.<ref name=NYT031313>{{cite news|title=No Species Is Safe From Burgeoning Wildlife Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/world/asia/no-species-is-safe-from-burgeoning-wildlife-trade.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 March 2013|author=Bettina Wassener}}</ref>\n\n==Ratifications==\n[[File:CITES.svg|thumb|300px|Parties to the treaty. [[Greenland]] is covered by CITES regulations through [[Denmark]].<ref name=DMK/>]]\nThe text of the Convention was finalized at a meeting of representatives of 80 countries in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States, on 3 March 1973. It was then open for signature until 31 December 1974. It entered into force after the 10th ratification by a signatory country, on 1 July 1975. Countries that signed the Convention become Parties by ratifying, accepting or approving it. By the end of 2003, all signatory countries had become Parties. States that were not signatories may become Parties by acceding to the Convention. As of October 2016, the Convention has 183 parties, including 182 states and the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/parties/chronolo.php|title=List of Contracting Parties - CITES|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe CITES Convention includes provisions and rules for trade with non-Parties. All member states of the [[United Nations]] are party to the treaty, with the exception of [[Andorra]], [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]], [[Federated States of Micronesia]], [[Haiti]], [[Kiribati]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[South Sudan]], [[Timor-Leste]], [[Tonga]], [[Turkmenistan]], and [[Tuvalu]]. UN observer the [[Holy See]] is also not a member. The [[Faroe Islands]], an autonomous country in the [[Kingdom of Denmark]], is also treated as a non-Party to CITES (both the Danish mainland and [[Greenland]] are part of CITES).<ref name=DMK>CITES: [http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/DK Denmark.] Retrieved 24 February 2015.</ref><ref>CITES: [http://www.cites.org/eng/cms/index.php/component/cp/country/FO Faroe Islands.] Retrieved 24 February 2015.</ref>\n\nAn amendment to the text of the Convention, known as the Gaborone Amendment<ref>{{cite web|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php |publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref> allows regional economic integration organizations (REIO), such as the [[European Union]], to have the status of a member state and to be a Party to the Convention.  The REIO can vote at CITES meetings with the number of votes representing the number of members in the REIO, but it does not have an additional vote.\n\nIn accordance with Article XVII, paragraph 3, of the CITES Convention, the Gaborone Amendment entered into force on 29 November 2013, 60 days after 54 (two-thirds) of the 80 States that were party to CITES on 30 April 1983 deposited their instrument of acceptance of the amendment.  At that time it entered into force only for those States that had accepted the amendment. The amended text of the Convention will apply automatically to any State that becomes a Party after 29 November 2013. For States that became party to the Convention before that date and have not accepted the amendment, it will enter into force 60 days after they accept it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/gaborone.php|title=Gaborone amendment to the text of the Convention - CITES|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation of trade==\nCITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls. All import, export, re-export and introduction from the sea of species covered by the Convention has to be authorized through a licensing system. According to Article IX of the Convention, Management and Scientific Authorities, each Party to the Convention must designate one or more Management Authorities in charge of administering that licensing system and one or more Scientific Authorities to advise them on the effects of trade on the status of CITES-listed species.\n\n==Appendices==\n\nRoughly 5,000 species of animals and 29,000 species of plants are protected by CITES against [[over-exploitation]] through international trade. Each protected species or population is included in one of three lists, called appendices<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|title=Appendices I, II and III|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=2013|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cites.org/eng/app/index.php|title=The CITES Appendices|author=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora|year=|accessdate=13 September 2013}}</ref> (explained below). The Appendix that lists a species or population reflects the extent of the threat to it and the controls that apply to the trade.\n\nSpecies may be split-listed meaning that some populations of a species are on one Appendix, while some are on another.  Some people argue that this is risky as specimens from a more protected population could be 'laundered' through the borders of a Party whose population is not as strictly protected.  The [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana'') is currently split-listed, with all populations except those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe listed in Appendix I.  Those of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe are listed in Appendix II.  Listing the species over the whole of its range would prevent such 'laundering' but also restricts trade in wildlife products by [[range states]] with good management practices. There are also species that have only some populations listed in an Appendix. One example is the [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana''), a ruminant native to North America. Its Mexican population is listed in Appendix I, but its U.S. and Canadian populations are not listed (though certain U.S. populations in Arizona are nonetheless protected under the [[Endangered Species Act]]).\n\nSpecies are proposed for inclusion in or deletion from the Appendices at meetings of the Conference of the Parties (CoP), which are held approximately once every three years, the most recent of which was CoP (CoP 17) in [[Johannesburg, South Africa]]  from 24 September to 5 October 2016 at the Sandton Convention Center.<ref name=\"CITES-Calendar\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php |title=CITES Calendar |publisher=CITES|work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nSpecies in the Appendices may be proposed for addition, change of Appendix, or de-listing (i.e., deletion) by any Party, whether or not it is a range State and changes may be made despite objections by range States if there is sufficient (2/3 majority) support for the listing.  These discussions are usually among the most contentious at CoP meetings.\n\nThere has been increasing willingness within the Parties to allow for trade in products from well-managed populations.  For instance, sales of the South African white rhino have generated revenues that helped pay for protection.  Listing the species on Appendix I increased the price of rhino horn (which fueled more poaching), but the species survived wherever there was adequate on-the-ground protection. Thus field protection may be the primary mechanism that saved the population, but it is likely that field protection would not have been increased without CITES protection.<ref name=Hutton>Hutton and Dickinson, Endangered Species Threatened Convention: The Past, Present and Future of CITES. London: Africa Resources Trust, 2000.</ref>\n\n===Appendix I===\nAppendix I, about 1200 species, are species that are threatened with extinction and are or may be affected by trade. Commercial trade in wild-caught specimens of these species is illegal (permitted only in exceptional licensed circumstances). Captive-bred animals or cultivated plants of Appendix I species are considered Appendix II specimens, with concomitant requirements (see below and Article VII).  The Scientific Authority of the exporting country must make a non-detriment finding, assuring that export of the individuals will not adversely affect the wild population.  Any trade in these species requires export and import permits. The Management Authority of the exporting state is expected to check that an import permit has been secured and that the importing state is able to care for the specimen adequately. Notable animal species listed in Appendix I include the [[red panda]] (''Ailurus fulgens''), [[western gorilla]] (''Gorilla gorilla''), the [[chimpanzee]] species (''Pan spp.''), [[tiger]]s (''Panthera tigris'' subspecies), [[Asiatic lion]] (''Panthera leo persica''), [[leopards]] (''Panthera pardus''), [[jaguar]] (''Panthera onca''), [[cheetah]] (''Acinonyx jubatus''), [[Asian elephant]] (''Elephas maximus''), some populations of [[African bush elephant]] (''Loxodonta africana''), the [[dugong]] and [[manatee]]s ([[Sirenia]]), and all [[rhinoceros]] species (except some Southern African subspecies populations).<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\">{{cite web|title=Appendices I, II and III |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/appendices.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Appendix II===\nAppendix II, about 21,000 species, are species that are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but may become so unless trade in specimens of such species is subject to strict regulation in order to avoid utilization incompatible with the survival of the species in the wild.  In addition, Appendix II can include species similar in appearance to species already listed in the Appendices.  International trade in specimens of Appendix II species may be authorized by the granting of an export permit or re-export certificate.  In practice, many hundreds of thousands of Appendix II animals are traded annually.<ref name=\"CITES-Quotas\">{{cite web|title=CITES Export Quotas |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/resources/quotas/index.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>  No import permit is necessary for these species under CITES, although some Parties do require import permits as part of their stricter domestic measures.  A non-detriment finding and export permit are required by the exporting Party.<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\"/>\n\nIn addition, Article VII of CITES states that specimens of animals listed in Appendix I that are bred in captivity for commercial purposes are treated as Appendix II. The same applies for specimens of Appendix I plants artificially propagated for commercial purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cites.org/eng/disc/text.php#VII |title=Article VII: Exemptions and Other Special Provisions Relating to Trade |work=Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora |publisher=CITES |accessdate=17 October 2014}}</ref>\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix II are the [[great white shark]] (''Carcharodon carcharias''), the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), [[Hartmann's mountain zebra]] (''Equus zebra hartmannae''), [[green iguana]] (''Iguana iguana''), [[queen conch]] (''Strombus gigas''), [[Emperor scorpion]] (''Pandinus imperator''), [[Mertens' water monitor]] (''Varanus mertensi''), bigleaf mahogany (''[[Swietenia macrophylla]]'') and [[lignum vitae]] \"ironwood\" (''Guaiacum officinale'').\n\n===Appendix III===\nAppendix III, about 170 species, are species that are listed after one member country has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling trade in a species.  The species are not necessarily threatened with extinction globally.  In all member countries, trade in these species is only permitted with an appropriate export permit and a certificate of origin from the state of the member country who has listed the species.<ref name=\"CITES-Appendices\" />\n\nExamples of species listed on Appendix III and the countries that listed them are the [[two-toed sloth]]  (''Choloepus hoffmanni'') by Costa Rica, [[sitatunga]] (Tragelaphus Spekii) by Ghana, [[African civet]] (''Civettictis civetta'') by Botswana, and [[alligator snapping turtle]] by the USA.\n\n==Amendments and reservations==\nAmendments to the Convention must be supported by a two-thirds majority who are \"present and voting\" and can be made during an extraordinary meeting of the COP if one-third of the Parties are interested in such a meeting.  The Gaborone Amendment (1983) allows regional economic blocs to accede to the treaty.  Reservations (Article XXIII) can be made by any Party with respect to any species, which considerably weakens the treaty (see [http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php ] for current reservations).  Trade with non-Party states is allowed, although permits and certificates are recommended to be issued by exporters and sought by importers.\n\nNotable reservations include those by [[Iceland]], [[Japan]] and [[Norway]] on various [[baleen]] whale species and those on [[Falconiformes]] by Saudi Arabia.<ref name=\"CITES-Reservations\">{{cite web|title=CITES Reservations Entered by Parties |url=http://www.cites.org/eng/app/reserve.php|publisher=CITES |work=cites.org |accessdate=13 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Shortcomings and concerns==\n\n===Approach to biodiversity conservation===\nGeneral limitations about the structure and philosophy of CITES include: by design and intent it focuses on trade at the species level and does not address habitat loss, [[ecosystem approach]]es to conservation, or poverty; it seeks to prevent unsustainable use rather than promote sustainable use (which generally conflicts with the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]), although this has been changing (see [[Nile crocodile]], [[African elephant]], South African [[white rhino]] case studies in Hutton and Dickinson 2000). It does not explicitly address market demand.<ref name=Hill>Hill, 1990, \"The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species: Fifteen Years Later,\" ''Loyola of Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Journal'' 13: 231</ref> Funding does not provide for increased on-the-ground enforcement (it must apply for bilateral aid for most projects of this nature).\n\n===Drafting===\nBy design, CITES regulates and monitors trade in the manner of a \"negative list\" such that trade in all species is permitted and unregulated ''unless'' the species in question appears on the Appendices or looks very much like one of those taxa. Then and only then, trade is regulated or constrained.  Because the remit of the Convention covers millions of species of plants and animals, and tens of thousands of these taxa are potentially of economic value, in practice this negative list approach effectively forces CITES signatories to expend limited resources on just a select few, leaving many species to be traded with neither constraint nor review.  For example, recently several bird classified as [[IUCN Red List|threatened with extinction]] appeared in the legal wild bird trade because the CITES process never considered their status.  If a \"positive list\" approach were taken, only species evaluated and approved for the positive list would be permitted in trade, thus lightening the review burden for member states and the Secretariat, and also preventing inadvertent legal trade threats to poorly known species.\n\nSpecific weaknesses in the text include: it does not stipulate guidelines for the 'non-detriment' finding required of national Scientific Authorities; non-detriment findings require copious amounts of information; the 'household effects' clause is often not rigid enough/specific enough to prevent CITES violations by means of this Article (VII); non-reporting from Parties means Secretariat monitoring is incomplete; and it has no capacity to address domestic trade in listed species.\n\n===Reform suggestions===\nSuggestions for improvement in the operation of CITES include: more regular missions by the Secretariat (not reserved just for high-profile species); improvement of national legislation and enforcement; better reporting by Parties (and the consolidation of information from all sources-NGOs, [[TRAFFIC, the wildlife trade monitoring network]] and Parties); more emphasis on enforcement-including a technical committee enforcement officer; the development of CITES Action Plans (akin to Biodiversity Action Plans related to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]) including: designation of Scientific/Management Authorities and national enforcement strategies; incentives for reporting and timelines for both Action Plans and reporting.  CITES would benefit from access to [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF), funds-although this is difficult given the GEFs more ecosystem approach-or other more regular funds.  Development of a future  mechanism similar to that of the Montreal Protocol (developed nations contribute to a fund for developing nations) could allow more funds for non-Secretariat activities.<ref name=\"Reeve\"/>\n\nOn 15 July 2008, the Committee of Environmental Insecticides that oversees the administration of the convention between meetings of all the Parties granted China and Japan permission to import elephant [[ivory]] from four African government stockpiles, the ivory being sold at a single auction in each country. The amounts to be sold comprise approximately 44 tons from Botswana, 9 tons from Namibia, 51 tons from South Africa, and 4 tons from Zimbabwe. The Chinese government in 2003 acknowledged that it had lost track of 121 tons of ivory between 1991 and 2002.\n\n=== [[Traffic (conservation programme)|TRAFFIC]] Data ===\nFrom 2005 &ndash; 2009 the legal trade corresponded with these numbers\n* 317,000 live birds\n* More than 2 million live reptiles\n* 2.5 million crocodile skins\n* 2.1 million [[Snakeskin|snake skins]]\n* 73 tons of [[caviar]]\n* 1.1 million beaver skins\n* Millions of pieces of [[coral]]\n* 20,000 mammalian [[Trophy hunting|hunting trophies]]\nIn the 1990s the annual trade of legal animal products was $160 billion annually. In 2009 the estimated value almost doubled to $300 billion.<ref>Ceballos, G.; Ehrlich, A. H.; Ehrlich, P. R. (2015). ''The Annihilation of Nature: Human Extinction of Birds and Mammals''.

The last Conference of the Parties (CoP 17) was held in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], and the one before it (CoP 16) was held in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], in 2013.  The next one (CoP 18) will be in [[Sri Lanka]] in 2019.  The location of the next CoP is chosen at the close of each CoP by a secret ballot vote.\n\nThe CITES Committees (Animals Committee, Plants Committee and Standing Committee) hold meetings during each year that does not have a CoP, while the Standing committee meets also in years with a CoP.  The Committee meetings take place in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] (where the Secretariat of the CITES Convention is located), unless another country offers to host the meeting.  The Animals and Plants Committees have sometimes held joint meetings.  The previous joint meeting was held in March 2012 in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the latest one was held in [[Veracruz (city)|Veracruz]], [[Mexico]] in May 2014.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=90|Meeting\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=1 width=110|City\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=120|Country\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=1 width=200|Duration\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 1\n|[[Bern]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 2\u20136 November 1976\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 2\n|[[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]]\n|{{flag|Costa Rica}}\n| 19\u201330 March 1979\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 3\n|[[New Delhi]]\n|{{flag|India}}\n| 25 February \u2013 8 March 1981\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 4\n|[[Gaborone]]\n|{{flag|Botswana}}\n| 19 \u2013 30 April 1983\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 5\n|[[Buenos Aires]]\n|{{flag|Argentina}}\n| 22 April \u2013 3 May 1985\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 6\n|[[Ottawa]]\n|{{flag|Canada}}\n| 12\u201324 July 1987\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 7\n|[[Lausanne]]\n|{{flag|Switzerland}}\n| 9\u201320 October 1989\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 8\n|[[Kyoto]]\n|{{flag|Japan}}\n| 2\u201313 March 1992\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 9\n|[[Fort Lauderdale]]\n|{{flag|United States}}\n| 7\u201318 November 1994\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 10\n|[[Harare]]\n|{{flag|Zimbabwe}}\n| 9\u201320 June 1997\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 11\n|[[Gigiri]]\n|{{flag|Kenya}}\n| 10\u201320 April 2000\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 12\n|[[Santiago]]\n|{{flag|Chile}}\n| 3\u201315 November 2002\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 13\n|[[Bangkok]]\n|{{flag|Thailand}}\n| 2\u201314 October 2004\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 14\n|[[The Hague]]\n|{{flag|Netherlands}}\n| 3\u201315 June 2007\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 15\n|[[Doha]]\n|{{flag|Qatar}}\n| 13\u201325 March 2010\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 16\n|[[Bangkok]]\n|{{flag|Thailand}}\n| 3\u201314 March 2013\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|CoP 17\n|[[Johannesburg]]\n|{{flag|South Africa}}\n| 24 September \u2013 5 October 2016\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''CoP 18''\n|[[Colombo]]\n|{{flag|Sri Lanka}}\n| ''2019''\n|-\n|}\n\nA current list of upcoming meetings appears on the CITES calendar at http://www.cites.org/eng/news/calendar.php.\n\n==See also==\n<!-- New links in alphabetical order please -->\n*[[Environmental agreements]]\n*[[IUCN Red List]]\n*[[Ivory trade]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix I]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix II]]\n*[[List of species protected by CITES Appendix III]]\n*[[Shark finning]]\n*[[Wildlife conservation]]\n*[[Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System]]\n*[[Wildlife management]]\n*[[Wildlife smuggling]]\n*[[World Wildlife Day]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Oldfield, S. and McGough, N.

Techniques''' is an international [[treaty]] prohibiting the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. It opened for signature on 18 May 1977 in [[Geneva]] and entered into force on 5 October 1978.\n\nThe Convention bans [[weather warfare]], which is the use of [[weather modification]] techniques for the purposes of inducing damage or destruction. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] of 2010 would also ban some forms of weather modification or geoengineering.<ref>http://www.cbd.int/cop10</ref>\n\nMany states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of [[herbicide]]s in warfare, such as [[Agent Orange]], but it does require case-by-case consideration.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule76 |title=Practice Relating to Rule 76. Herbicides |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |year=2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Parties==\n{{Main|List of parties to the Environmental Modification Convention}}\nThe Convention was signed by 48 states; 16 of the signatories have not ratified. As of January 2018, the Convention has 78 state parties.<ref name=undb/>\n\n==History==\nThe problem of artificial modification of the environment for military or other hostile purposes was brought to the international agenda in the early 1970s. Following the US decision of July 1972 to renounce the use of climate modification techniques for hostile purposes, the 1973 resolution by the US Senate calling for an international agreement \"prohibiting the use of any environmental or geophysical modification activity as a weapon of war\", and an in-depth review by the Department of Defense of the military aspects of weather and other environmental modification techniques, US decided to seek agreement with the Soviet Union to explore the possibilities of an international agreement.\n\nIn July 1974, US and USSR agreed to hold bilateral discussions on measures to overcome the danger of the use of environmental modification techniques for military purposes and three subsequent rounds of discussions in 1974 and 1975. In August 1975, US and USSR tabled identical draft texts of a convention at the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament (CCD), [[Conference on Disarmament]], where intensive negotiations resulted in a modified text and understandings regarding four articles of this Convention in 1976.\n\nThe Convention was approved by [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72|Resolution 31/72]] of the General Assembly of the United Nations on 10 December 1976, by 96 to 8 votes with 30 abstentions.\n\n==Environmental Modification Technique==\nEnvironmental Modification Technique includes any technique for changing \u2013 through the deliberate manipulation of natural processes \u2013 the dynamics, composition or structure of the earth, including its biota, lithosphere, hydrosphere and atmosphere, or of outer space.\n\n==Structure of ENMOD==\nThe Convention contains ten articles and one Annex on the Consultative Committee of Experts. Integral part of the Convention are also the Understandings relating to articles I, II, III and VIII. These Understandings are not incorporated into the Convention but are part of the negotiating record and were included in the report transmitted by the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament to the United Nations General Assembly in September 1976 Report of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament, Volume I, General Assembly Official records: Thirty-first session, Supplement No. 27

Retrieved 28 May 2012</ref> or '''halting probability''' is a [[real number]] that, informally speaking, represents the [[probability]] that a randomly constructed program will halt. These numbers are formed from a construction due to [[Gregory Chaitin]].\n\nAlthough there are infinitely many halting probabilities, it is common to use the letter &Omega; to refer to them as if there were only one.  Because &Omega; depends on the program encoding used, it is sometimes called '''Chaitin's construction''' instead of '''Chaitin's constant''' when not referring to any specific encoding.\n\nEach halting probability is a [[normal number|normal]] and [[transcendental number|transcendental]] real number that is not [[computable number|computable]], which means that there is no [[algorithm]] to compute its digits. Indeed, each halting probability is [[Algorithmically random sequence|Martin-L\u00f6f random]], meaning there is not even any algorithm which can reliably guess its digits.\n\n== Background ==\nThe definition of a halting probability relies on the existence of a '''prefix-free universal computable function.'''  Such a function, intuitively, represents a programming language with the property that no valid program can be obtained as a proper extension of another valid program.\n\nSuppose that ''F'' is a partial function that takes one argument, a finite binary string, and possibly returns a single binary string as output. The function ''F'' is called '''[[Computable function|computable]]''' if there is a [[Turing machine]] that computes it (in the sense that for any finite binary string ''x'' such that ''F(x) = y'' the Turing machine halts with ''y'' on its tape when given the input ''x'').\n\nThe function ''F'' is called '''[[Computational universality|universal]]''' if the following property holds:  for every computable function ''f'' of a single variable there is a string ''w'' such that for all ''x'', ''F''(''w''&nbsp;''x'') = ''f''(''x''); here ''w''&nbsp;''x'' represents the [[concatenation]] of the two strings ''w'' and ''x''.  This means that ''F'' can be used to simulate any computable function of one variable.  Informally, ''w'' represents a \"script\" for the computable function ''f'', and ''F'' represents an \"interpreter\" that parses the script as a prefix of its input and then executes it on the remainder of input.\n\nThe '''domain''' of ''F'' is the set of all inputs ''p'' on which it is defined. For ''F'' that are universal, such a ''p'' can generally be seen both as the concatenation of a program part and a data part, as a single program for the function ''F''.\n\nThe function ''F'' is called '''prefix-free''' if there are no two elements ''p'', ''p&prime;'' in its domain such that ''p&prime;'' is a proper extension of ''p''. This can be rephrased as: the domain of ''F'' is a [[prefix-free code]] (instantaneous code) on the set of finite binary strings. A simple way to enforce prefix-free-ness is to use machines whose means of input is a binary stream from which bits can be read one at a time. There is no end-of-stream marker; the end of input is determined by when the universal machine decides to stop reading more bits. Here, the difference between the two notions of program mentioned in the last paragraph becomes clear; one is easily recognized by some grammar, while the other requires arbitrary computation to recognize.\n\nThe domain of any universal computable function is a [[computably enumerable set]] but never a [[computable set]].  The domain is always [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] to the [[halting problem]].\n\n== Definition ==\nLet ''P''<sub>F</sub> be the domain of a prefix-free universal computable function ''F''.  The constant &Omega;<sub>F</sub> is then defined as\n:<math>\\Omega_F = \\sum_{p \\in P_F} 2^{-|p|}</math>,\nwhere <math>\\left|p\\right|</math> denotes the length of a string ''p''.\nThis is an [[series (mathematics)|infinite sum]] which has one summand for every ''p'' in the domain of ''F''.  The requirement that the domain be prefix-free, together with [[Kraft's inequality]], ensures that this sum converges to a [[real number]] between 0 and 1.  If ''F'' is clear from context then &Omega;<sub>F</sub> may be denoted simply &Omega;, although different prefix-free universal computable functions lead to different values of &Omega;.\n\n== Relationship to the halting problem ==\nKnowing the first ''N'' bits of &Omega;, one could calculate the [[halting problem]] for all programs of a size up to ''N''. Let the program ''p'' for which the halting problem is to be solved be ''N'' bits long. In [[Dovetailing (computer science)|dovetailing]] fashion, all programs of all lengths are run, until enough have halted to jointly contribute enough probability to match these first ''N'' bits. If the program ''p'' hasn't halted yet, then it never will, since its contribution to the halting probability would affect the first ''N'' bits. Thus, the halting problem would be solved for ''p''.\n\nBecause many outstanding problems in number theory, such as [[Goldbach's conjecture]] are equivalent to solving the halting problem for special programs (which would basically search for counter-examples and halt if one is found), knowing enough bits of Chaitin's constant would also imply knowing the answer to these problems. But as the halting problem is not generally solvable, and therefore calculating any but the first few bits of Chaitin's constant is not possible, this just reduces hard problems to impossible ones, much like trying to build an [[Oracle machine#Oracles and halting problems|oracle machine for the halting problem]] would be.\n\n==Interpretation as a probability==\nThe [[Cantor space]] is the collection of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s. A halting probability can be interpreted as the [[measure theory|measure]] of a certain subset of Cantor space under the usual [[probability measure]] on Cantor space.  It is from this interpretation that halting probabilities take their name.\n\nThe probability measure on Cantor space, sometimes called the fair-coin measure, is defined so that for any binary string ''x'' the set of sequences that begin with ''x'' has measure 2<sup>\u2212|''x''|</sup>. This implies that for each natural number ''n'', the set of sequences ''f'' in Cantor space such that ''f''(''n'') = 1 has measure 1/2, and the set of sequences whose ''n''th element is 0 also has measure 1/2.\n\nLet ''F'' be a prefix-free universal computable function. The domain ''P'' of ''F'' consists of an infinite set of binary strings\n:<math>P = \\{p_1,p_2,\\ldots\\}</math>.\nEach of these strings ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> determines a subset ''S''<sub>''i''</sub> of Cantor space; the set ''S''<sub>''i''</sub>  contains all sequences in cantor space that begin with ''p''<sub>''i''</sub>. These sets are disjoint because ''P'' is a prefix-free set.  The sum\n:<math>\\sum_{p \\in P} 2^{-|p|}</math>\nrepresents the measure of the set \n:<math>\\bigcup_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} S_i</math>.\n\nIn this way, &Omega;<sub>''F''</sub> represents the probability that a randomly selected infinite sequence of 0s and 1s begins with a bit string (of some finite length) that is in the domain of ''F''. It is for this reason that &Omega;<sub>''F''</sub> is called a halting probability.\n\n== Properties ==\nEach Chaitin constant &Omega; has the following properties{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}:\n* It is [[algorithmic randomness|algorithmically random]]. This means that the shortest program to output the first ''n'' bits of &Omega; must be of size at least ''n''-O(1). This is because, as in the Goldbach example, those ''n'' bits enable us to find out exactly which programs halt among all those of length at most ''n''.\n* It is a [[normal number]], which means that its digits are equidistributed as if they were generated by tossing a fair coin.\n* It is not a [[computable number]]; there is no computable function that enumerates its binary expansion, as discussed below.\n* The set of rational numbers ''q'' such that ''q'' < &Omega; is [[computably enumerable set|computably enumerable]]; a real number with such a property is called a '''left-c.e. real number''' in [[recursion theory]].\n* The set of rational numbers ''q'' such that ''q'' > &Omega; is not computably enumerable.\n* &Omega; is an [[arithmetical number]].\n* It is [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] to the [[halting problem]] and thus at level <math>\\Delta^0_2</math> of the [[arithmetical hierarchy]].\n\nNot every set that is Turing equivalent to the halting problem is a halting probability.   A [[equivalence relation#Comparing equivalence relations|finer]] equivalence relation, '''Solovay equivalence''', can be used to characterize the halting probabilities among the left-c.e. reals.\n\n== Uncomputability ==\nA real number is called computable if there is an algorithm which, given ''n'', returns the first ''n'' digits of the number.  This is equivalent to the existence of a program that enumerates the digits of the real number.\n\nNo halting probability is computable. The proof of this fact relies on an algorithm which, given the first ''n'' digits of &Omega;, solves Turing's [[halting problem]] for programs of length up to ''n''. Since the halting problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], &Omega; cannot be computed.\n\nThe algorithm proceeds as follows.  Given the first ''n'' digits of &Omega; and a ''k'' \u2264 ''n'', the algorithm enumerates the domain of ''F'' until enough elements of the domain have been found so that the probability they represent is within 2<sup>\u2212(''k''+1)</sup> of &Omega;. After this point, no additional program of length ''k'' can be in the domain, because each of these would add 2<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> to the measure, which is impossible.  Thus the set of strings of length ''k'' in the domain is exactly the set of such strings already enumerated.\n\n== Algorithmic randomness ==\nA real number is random if the binary sequence representing the real number is an [[algorithmically random sequence]]. \nCalude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang showed<ref>Calude, Hertling, Khoussainov, and Wang: Recursively enumerable reals and Chaitin's &Omega; numbers. Theoretical Computer Science 255:125\u2013149, (2001) http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/TCS01.pdf </ref>\nthat a recursively enumerable real number is an algorithmically random sequence  if and only if it is a Chaitin's &Omega;  number.\n\n== Incompleteness theorem for halting probabilities ==\n{{main|Chaitin's incompleteness theorem}}\n\nFor each specific consistent effectively represented [[axiomatic system]] for the [[natural numbers]], such as [[Peano axioms|Peano arithmetic]], there exists a constant ''N'' such that no bit of &Omega; after the ''N''th can be proven to be 1 or 0 within that system. The constant ''N'' depends on how the [[formal system]] is effectively represented, and thus does not directly reflect the complexity of the axiomatic system. This incompleteness result is similar to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]] in that it shows that no consistent formal theory for arithmetic can be complete.\n\n== Super Omega ==\nAs mentioned above, the first n bits of [[Gregory Chaitin]]'s constant &Omega; are random or  incompressible in the sense that we cannot compute them by a halting algorithm with fewer than n-O(1) bits. However, consider the short but never halting algorithm which systematically lists and runs all possible programs; whenever one of them halts its probability gets added to the output (initialized by zero). After finite time the first n bits of the output will never change any more (it does not matter that this time itself is not computable by a halting program). So there is a short non-halting algorithm whose output converges (after finite time) onto the first n bits of &Omega;. In other words, the [[enumerable]] first n bits of &Omega; are highly compressible in the sense that they are [[limit-computable]] by a very short algorithm; they are not [[random]] with respect to the set of enumerating algorithms. [[J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber]] (2000) constructed a limit-computable \"Super &Omega;\" which in a sense is much more random than the original limit-computable &Omega;, as one cannot significantly compress the Super &Omega; by any enumerating non-halting algorithm.\n\nFor an alternative \"Super &Omega;\", the [[universality probability]] of a [[prefix-free code|prefix-free]] [[Universal Turing Machine]] (UTM){{Snd}} namely, the probability that it remains universal even when every input of it (as a [[binary string]]) is prefixed by a random binary string{{Snd}} can be seen as the non-halting probability of a machine with oracle the third iteration of the [[halting problem]] (i.e., 0``` = 0^{(3)}).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Barmpalias, G. and Dowe D.L. |title=Universality probability of a prefix-free machine |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A |volume=370 |issue=1 | pages=3488\u20133511 (Theme Issue 'The foundations of computation, physics and mentality: the Turing legacy' compiled and edited by Barry Cooper and Samson Abramsky) |date=2012 |doi=10.1098/rsta.2011.0319}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Incompleteness theorem]]\n* [[Kolmogorov complexity]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n* Cristian S.

They are also known as the '''recursive numbers''' or the '''computable reals''' or '''recursive reals'''.\n\nEquivalent definitions can be given using [[\u03bc-recursive function]]s, [[Turing machines]], or [[lambda calculus|\u03bb-calculus]] as the formal representation of algorithms. The computable numbers form a [[real closed field]] and can be used in the place of real numbers for many, but not all, mathematical purposes.\n\n==Informal definition using a Turing machine as example==\nIn the following, [[Marvin Minsky]] defines the numbers to be computed in a manner similar to those defined by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936; i.e., as \"sequences of digits interpreted as decimal fractions\" between 0 and 1:\n \n:\"A computable number [is] one for which there is a Turing machine which, given ''n'' on its initial tape, terminates with the ''nth'' digit of that number [encoded on its tape].\" (Minsky 1967:159)\n\nThe key notions in the definition are (1) that some ''n'' is specified at the start, (2) for any ''n'' the computation only takes a finite number of steps, after which the machine produces the desired output and terminates.\n\nAn alternate form of (2) \u2013 the machine successively prints all n of the digits on its tape, halting after printing the n<sup>th</sup> \u2013 emphasizes Minsky's observation: (3) That by use of a Turing machine, a ''finite'' definition \u2013 in the form of the machine's table \u2013 is being used to define what is a potentially-''infinite'' string of decimal digits.\n\nThis is however not the modern definition which only requires the result be accurate to within any given accuracy. The informal definition above is subject to a rounding problem called the [[table-maker's dilemma]] whereas the modern definition is not.\n\n==Formal definition==\nA [[real number]] ''a'' is '''computable''' if it can be approximated by some [[computable function]] <math>f:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{Z}</math> in the following manner: given any positive [[integer]] ''n'', the function produces an integer ''f''(''n'') such that:\n\n:<math>{f(n)-1\\over n} \\leq a \\leq {f(n)+1\\over n}.</math>\n\nThere are two similar definitions that are equivalent:\n*There exists a computable function which, given any positive rational [[error bound]] <math>\\varepsilon</math>, produces a [[rational number]] ''r'' such that <math>|r - a| \\leq \\varepsilon.</math>\n*There is a computable sequence of rational numbers <math>q_i</math> converging to <math>a</math> such that <math>|q_i - q_{i+1}| < 2^{-i}\\,</math> for each ''i''.\n\nThere is another equivalent definition of computable numbers via computable [[Dedekind cut]]s. A '''computable Dedekind cut''' is a computable function <math>D\\;</math> which when provided with a rational number <math>r</math> as input returns <math>D(r)=\\mathrm{true}\\;</math> or <math>D(r)=\\mathrm{false}\\;</math>, satisfying the following conditions:\n:<math>\\exists r D(r)=\\mathrm{true}\\;</math>\n:<math>\\exists r D(r)=\\mathrm{false}\\;</math>\n:<math>(D(r)=\\mathrm{true}) \\wedge (D(s)=\\mathrm{false}) \\Rightarrow r<s\\;</math>\n:<math>D(r)=\\mathrm{true} \\Rightarrow \\exist s>r, D(s)=\\mathrm{true}.\\;</math>\nAn example is given by a program ''D'' that defines the [[cube root]] of 3. Assuming <math>q>0\\;</math> this is defined by:\n:<math>p^3<3 q^3 \\Rightarrow D(p/q)=\\mathrm{true}\\;</math>\n:<math>p^3>3 q^3 \\Rightarrow D(p/q)=\\mathrm{false}.\\;</math>\n\nA real number is computable if and only if there is a computable Dedekind cut ''D'' corresponding to it. The function ''D'' is unique for each computable number (although of course two different programs may provide the same function).\n\nA [[complex number]] is called computable if its real and imaginary parts are computable.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Countable but not computably enumerable===\nWhile the set of real numbers is [[uncountable]], the set of computable numbers is only [[countable]] and thus [[almost all]] real numbers are not computable. That the computable numbers are [[countable|at most countable]] intuitively comes from the fact that they are produced by Turing machines, of which there are only countably many.  More precisely, assigning a [[G\u00f6del number]] to each Turing machine definition produces a subset <math>S</math> of the [[natural numbers]] corresponding to the computable numbers and identifies a [[surjection]] from <math>S</math> to the computable numbers, which shows that the computable numbers are [[subcountable]].  Moreover, for any computable number <math>x,</math> the [[well ordering principle]] provides that there is a minimal element in <math>S</math> which corresponds to <math>x</math>, and therefore there exists a subset <math>S_1\\subset S</math> consisting of the minimal elements, on which the map is a [[bijection]].  The inverse of this bijection is an [[Injective function|injection]] into the natural numbers of the computable numbers, proving that they are countable.\n\nThe set <math>S</math> of these G\u00f6del numbers, however, is not [[computably enumerable]] (nor consequently is <math>S_1</math>), even though the computable reals are themselves ordered. This is because there is no algorithm to determine which G\u00f6del numbers correspond to Turing machines that produce computable reals. In order to produce a computable real, a Turing machine must compute a [[total function]], but the corresponding [[decision problem]] is in [[Turing degree]] '''0&prime;&prime;'''. Consequently, there is no surjective [[computable function]] from the natural numbers to the computable reals, and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]] cannot be used [[Constructivism (mathematics)|constructively]] to demonstrate uncountably many of them.\n\n===Properties as a field===\nThe arithmetical operations on computable numbers are themselves computable in the sense that whenever real numbers ''a'' and ''b'' are computable then the following real numbers are also computable: ''a + b'', ''a - b'', ''ab'', and ''a/b'' if ''b'' is nonzero.\nThese operations are actually ''uniformly computable''; for example, there is a Turing machine which on input (''A'',''B'',<math>\\epsilon</math>) produces output ''r'', where ''A'' is the description of a Turing machine approximating ''a'', ''B'' is the description of a Turing machine approximating ''b'', and ''r'' is an <math>\\epsilon</math> approximation of ''a''+''b''.\n\nThe fact that computable real numbers form a field was first proved by [[Henry Gordon Rice]] (1954).\n\nComputable reals do not form however a [[computable algebra|computable field]], because the definition of the latter notion requires effective equality.\n\n===Non-computability of the ordering===\nThe order relation on the computable numbers is not computable. Let ''A'' be the description of a Turing machine approximating the number <math>a</math>. Then there is no Turing machine which on input ''A'' outputs \"YES\" if <math>a > 0</math> and \"NO\" if <math>a \\le 0.</math> To see why, suppose the machine described by ''A'' keeps outputting 0 as <math>\\epsilon</math> approximations. It is not clear how long to wait before deciding that the machine will ''never'' output an approximation which forces ''a'' to be positive. Thus the machine will eventually have to guess that the number will equal 0, in order to produce an output; the sequence may later become different from 0. This idea can be used to show that the machine is incorrect on some sequences if it computes a total function. A similar problem occurs when the computable reals are represented as [[Dedekind cut]]s. The same holds for the equality relation : the equality test is not computable.\n\nWhile the full order relation is not computable, the restriction of it to pairs of unequal numbers is computable. That is, there is a program that takes as input two Turing machines ''A'' and ''B'' approximating numbers ''a'' and ''b'', where ''a'' \u2260 ''b'', and outputs whether <math>a < b</math> or <math>a > b.</math> It is sufficient to use ''\u03b5''-approximations where <math> \\varepsilon < |b-a|/2,</math> so by taking increasingly small \u03b5 (approaching 0), one eventually can decide whether <math>a < b</math> or <math>a > b.</math>\n\n===Other properties===\nThe computable real numbers do not share all the properties of the real numbers used in analysis. For example, the least upper bound of a bounded increasing computable sequence of computable real numbers need not be a computable real number (Bridges and Richman, 1987:58). A sequence with this property is known as a [[Specker sequence]], as the first construction is due to E. Specker (1949). Despite the existence of counterexamples such as these, parts of calculus and real analysis can be developed in the field of computable numbers, leading to the study of [[computable analysis]].\n\nEvery computable number is [[definable number|definable]], but not vice versa. There are many definable, noncomputable real numbers, including:\n*any number that encodes the solution of the [[halting problem]] (or any other [[undecidable problem]]) according to a chosen encoding scheme.\n*[[Chaitin's constant]], <math>\\Omega</math>, which is a type of real number that is [[Turing degree|Turing equivalent]] to the halting problem.\nBoth of these examples in fact define an infinite set of definable, uncomputable numbers, one for each [[Universal Turing machine]].\nA real number is computable if and only if the set of natural numbers it represents (when written in binary and viewed as a characteristic function) is computable.\n\nEvery computable number is [[arithmetical number|arithmetical]].\n\nThe set of computable real numbers (as well as every countable, [[densely ordered]] subset of computable reals without ends) is [[order-isomorphic]] to the set of rational numbers.\n\n==Digit strings and the Cantor and Baire spaces==\n\nTuring's original paper defined computable numbers as follows:\n\n:A real number is computable if its digit sequence can be produced by some algorithm or Turing machine. The algorithm takes an integer <math>n \\ge 1</math> as input and produces the <math>n</math>-th digit of the real number's decimal expansion as output.\n\n(Note that the decimal expansion of ''a'' only refers to the digits following the decimal point.)\n\nTuring was aware that this definition is equivalent to the <math>\\epsilon</math>-approximation definition given above. The argument proceeds as follows: if a number is computable in the Turing sense, then it is also computable in the <math>\\epsilon</math> sense: if <math>n > \\log_{10} (1/\\epsilon)</math>, then the first ''n'' digits of the decimal expansion for ''a'' provide an <math>\\epsilon</math> approximation of ''a''. For the converse, we pick an <math>\\epsilon</math> computable real number ''a'' and generate increasingly precise approximations until the ''n''th digit after the decimal point is certain. This always generates a decimal expansion equal to ''a'' but it may improperly end in an infinite sequence of 9's in which case it must have a finite (and thus computable) proper decimal expansion.\n\nUnless certain topological properties of the real numbers are relevant it is often more convenient to deal with elements of <math>2^{\\omega}</math> (total 0,1 valued functions) instead of reals numbers in <math>[0,1]</math>. The members of <math>2^{\\omega}</math> can be identified with binary decimal expansions but since the decimal expansions <math>.d_1d_2\\ldots d_n0111\\ldots</math> and <math>.d_1d_2\\ldots d_n10</math> denote the same real number the interval <math>[0,1]</math> can only be bijectively (and homeomorphically under the subset topology) identified with the subset of <math>2^{\\omega}</math> not ending in all 1's.\n\nNote that this property of decimal expansions means it's impossible to effectively identify computable real numbers defined in terms of a decimal expansion and those defined in the <math>\\epsilon</math> approximation sense. Hirst has shown there is no algorithm which takes as input the description of a Turing machine which produces <math>\\epsilon</math> approximations for the computable number ''a'', and produces as output a Turing machine which enumerates the digits of ''a'' in the sense of Turing's definition (see Hirst 2007). Similarly it means that the arithmetic operations on the computable reals are not effective on their decimal representations as when adding decimal numbers, in order to produce one digit it may be necessary to look arbitrarily far to the right to determine if there is a carry to the current location. This lack of uniformity is one reason that the contemporary definition of computable numbers uses <math>\\epsilon</math> approximations rather than decimal expansions.\n\nHowever, from a computational or measure theoretic perspective the two structures <math>2^{\\omega}</math> and <math>[0,1]</math> are essentially identical, and computability theorists often refer to members of <math>2^{\\omega}</math> as reals. While <math>[0,1]</math> <math>2^{\\omega}</math> is [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]] for questions about <math>\\Pi^0_1</math> classes or randomness it's much less messy to work in <math>2^{\\omega}</math>.\n\nElements of <math>\\omega^{\\omega}</math> are sometimes called reals as well and though containing a homeomorphic image of <math>\\mathbb{R}</math> <math>\\omega^{\\omega}</math> in addition to being totally disconnected isn't even locally compact. This leads to genuine differences in the computational properties. For instance the <math>x \\in \\mathbb{R}</math> satisfying <math>\\forall(n \\in \\omega)\\phi(x,n)</math> with <math>\\phi(x,n)</math> quantifier free must be computable while the unique <math>x \\in \\omega^{\\omega}</math> satisfying a universal formula can be arbitrarily high in the hyperarithmetic hierarchy.\n\n==Can computable numbers be used instead of the reals?==\n\nThe computable numbers include many of the specific real numbers which appear in practice, including all real [[algebraic number]]s, as well as ''e'', <math>\\pi</math>, and many other [[transcendental number]]s. Though the computable reals exhaust those reals we can calculate or approximate, the assumption that all reals are computable leads to substantially different conclusions about the real numbers. The question naturally arises of whether it is possible to dispose of the full set of reals and use computable numbers for all of mathematics. This idea is appealing from a [[constructivism (mathematics)|constructivist]] point of view, and has been pursued by what [[Errett Bishop|Bishop]] and Richman call the ''Russian school'' of constructive mathematics.\n\nTo actually develop analysis over computable numbers, some care must be taken. For example, if one uses the classical definition of a sequence, the set of computable numbers is not closed under the basic operation of taking the [[supremum]] of a [[bounded sequence]] (for example, consider a [[Specker sequence]]). This difficulty is addressed by considering only sequences which have a computable [[modulus of convergence]]. The resulting mathematical theory is called [[computable analysis]].\n\n==Implementation==\n\nThere are some computer packages that work with computable real numbers, representing the real numbers as programs computing approximations.  One example is the [[RealLib]] package.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Definable number]]\n*[[Semicomputable function]]\n*[[Transcomputational problem]]\n\n==References==\n\n*Oliver Aberth 1968, ''Analysis in the Computable Number Field'', Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery (JACM), vol 15, iss 2, pp 276\u2013299.

They also create [[magnetic fields]], which are used in motors, inductors and generators.\n\nThe moving charged particles in an electric current are called [[charge carrier]]s.  In [[metal]]s, one or more electrons from each atom are loosely bound to the atom, and can move freely about within the metal. These [[conduction electron]]s are the charge carriers in metal conductors.\n\n==Symbol==\nThe conventional symbol for current is {{math|''I''}}, which originates from the French phrase ''intensit\u00e9 de courant'', (current intensity).<ref>T.

In metals, which make up the wires and other conductors in most [[electrical circuit]]s, the positively charged [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] are held in a fixed position, and the negatively charged [[electron]]s are free to move, carrying their charge from one place to another. In other materials, notably the [[semiconductor]]s, the charge carriers can be positive ''or'' negative, depending on the [[dopant]] used. Positive and negative charge carriers may even be present at the same time, as happens in an [[electrolyte]] in an [[electrochemical cell]].\n\nA flow of positive charges gives the same electric current, and has the same effect in a circuit, as an equal flow of negative charges in the opposite direction. Since current can be the flow of either positive or negative charges, or both, a convention is needed for the direction of current that is independent of the type of [[charge carrier]]s.  The direction of ''conventional current'' is arbitrarily defined as the same direction as positive charges flow.\n\nSince electrons, the charge carriers in metal wires and most other parts of electric circuits, have a negative charge, as a consequence, they flow in the opposite direction of conventional current flow in an electrical circuit.\n\n=== Reference direction ===\nSince the current in a wire or component can flow in either direction, when a variable {{math|''I''}} is defined to represent that current, the direction representing positive current must be specified, usually by an arrow on the circuit [[schematic diagram]].  This is called the ''reference direction'' of current {{math|''I''}}.  If the current flows in the opposite direction, the variable {{math|''I''}} has a negative value.\n\nWhen analyzing electrical circuits, the actual direction of current through a specific circuit element is usually unknown. Consequently, the reference directions of currents are often assigned arbitrarily. When the circuit is solved, a negative value for the variable means that the actual direction of current through that circuit element is opposite that of the chosen reference direction.\nIn electronic circuits, the reference current directions are often chosen so that all currents are toward ground. This often corresponds to the actual current direction, because in many circuits the [[power supply]] voltage is positive with respect to ground.\n\n==Ohm's law==\n{{main|Ohm's law}}\n\nOhm's law states that the current through a conductor between two points is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[potential difference]] across the two points.

AC is the form of [[electric power]] most commonly delivered to businesses and residences. The usual [[waveform]] of an [[AC power]] circuit is a [[sine wave]]. Certain applications use different waveforms, such as [[Triangle wave|triangular]] or [[square wave]]s. [[Audio frequency|Audio]] and [[Radio frequency|radio]] signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. An important goal in these applications is recovery of information encoded (or ''[[modulated]]'') onto the AC signal.\n\nIn contrast, [[direct current]] (DC) is the unidirectional flow of electric charge, or a system in which the movement of electric charge is in one direction only. Direct current is produced by sources such as [[battery (electrical)|batteries]], [[thermocouple]]s, [[solar cell]]s, and [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]-type electric machines of the [[dynamo]] type. Direct current may flow in a [[conductor (material)|conductor]] such as a wire, but can also flow through [[semiconductor]]s, [[electrical insulation|insulator]]s, or even through a [[vacuum]] as in [[electron beam|electron or ion beams]]. An [[archaism|old name]] for direct current was ''galvanic current''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Clinical Electrophysiology: Electrotherapy and Electrophysiologic Testing |author1=Andrew J.

[[Eddy current]]s are electric currents that occur in conductors exposed to changing magnetic fields. Similarly, electric currents occur, particularly in the surface, of conductors exposed to [[electromagnetic wave]]s. When oscillating electric currents flow at the correct voltages within [[radio antenna]]s, [[radio wave]]s are generated.\n\nIn [[electronics]], other forms of electric current include the flow of electrons through [[resistor]]s or through the vacuum in a [[vacuum tube]], the flow of ions inside a [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] or a [[neuron]], and the flow of [[Electron hole|holes]] within a [[semiconductor]].\n\n==Current measurement==\nCurrent can be measured using an [[ammeter]].\n\nAt the circuit level, various [[Current sensing techniques|techniques]] are used to measure current:\n*[[Shunt resistor]]s<ref>[http://www.ti.com/analog/docs/microsite.tsp?sectionId=560&tabId=2180&micrositeId=7 What is a Current Sensor and How is it Used?].

It was first studied by [[James Prescott Joule]] in 1841. Joule immersed a length of wire in a fixed [[mass]] of [[water]] and measured the [[temperature]] rise due to a known current through the wire for a 30 [[minute]] period. By varying the current and the length of the wire he deduced that the heat produced was [[proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the current multiplied by the [[electrical resistance]] of the wire.\n\n:<math>Q \\propto I^2 R </math>\n\nThis relationship is known as [[Joule's first law|Joule's First Law]]. The [[SI unit]] of [[energy]] was subsequently named the [[joule]] and given the symbol ''J''. The commonly known unit of power, the [[watt]], is equivalent to one joule per second.\n\n== Electromagnetism ==\n\n===Electromagnet===\n{{main|Electromagnet}}In an electromagnet a coil, of a large number of circular turns of insulated wire, wrapped on a cylindrical core, behaves like a magnet when an electric current flows through it. When the current is switched off, the coil loses its magnetism immediately.<ref>{{Cite book|title = We And Our World|publisher = D.A.V. College Managing Committee}}</ref><ref>From the book/ We And Our World</ref>[[Image:Electromagnetism.svg|175px|thumb|According to [[Amp\u00e8re's circuital law|Amp\u00e8re's law]], an electric current produces a [[magnetic field]].]]\nElectric current produces a [[magnetic field]].  The magnetic field can be visualized as a pattern of circular field lines surrounding the wire that persists as long as there is current.\n\nMagnetism can also produce electric currents. When a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, an [[Electromotive force]] (EMF) is produced, and when there is a suitable path, this causes current.\n\nElectric current can be directly measured with a [[galvanometer]], but this method involves breaking the [[electrical circuit]], which is sometimes inconvenient.  Current can also be measured without breaking the circuit by detecting the magnetic field associated with the current.  Devices used for this include [[Hall effect]] [[sensor]]s, [[current clamp]]s, [[current transformer]]s, and [[Rogowski coil]]s.\n\n===Radio waves===\n{{main|Radio waves}}\nWhen an electric current flows in a [[antenna (radio)|suitably shaped conductor]] at [[radio frequencies]] [[radio waves]] can be generated. These travel at the [[speed of light]] and can cause electric currents in distant conductors.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Conduction mechanisms in various media==\n{{main|Electrical conductivity|Charge transport mechanisms}}\nIn metallic solids, electric charge flows by means of [[electron]]s, from lower to higher [[electrical potential]]. In other media, any stream of charged objects (ions, for example) may constitute an electric current.  To provide a definition of current independent of the type of charge carriers, ''conventional current'' is defined as moving in the same direction as the positive charge flow. So, in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current is in the opposite direction as the electrons.  In conductors where the charge carriers are positive, conventional current is in the same direction as the charge carriers.\n\nIn a [[vacuum]], a beam of ions or electrons may be formed. In other conductive materials, the electric current is due to the flow of both positively and negatively charged particles at the same time. In still others, the current is entirely due to [[proton conductor|positive charge flow]]. For example, the electric currents in [[electrolyte]]s are flows of positively and negatively charged ions.  In a common lead-acid [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] cell, electric currents are composed of positive hydrogen ions (protons) flowing in one direction, and negative sulfate ions flowing in the other.  Electric currents in [[electric spark|sparks]] or [[Plasma physics|plasma]] are flows of electrons as well as positive and negative ions.  In ice and in certain solid electrolytes, the electric current is entirely composed of flowing ions.\n\n=== Metals ===\n\nIn a [[metal]], some of the outer electrons in each atom are not bound to the individual atom as they are in insulating materials, but are free to move within the [[Metal#Definition|metal lattice]].  These [[conduction electron]]s can serve as [[charge carrier]]s, carrying a current.   Metals are particularly conductive because there are a large number of these free electrons, typically one per atom in the lattice.  With no external [[electric field]] applied, these electrons move about randomly due to [[thermal energy]] but, on average, there is zero net current within the metal.  At room temperature, the average speed of these random motions is 10<sup>6</sup> metres per second.<ref>[http://library.thinkquest.org/C0111709/English/DC-Circuts/mechanism.html \"The Mechanism Of Conduction In Metals\"], Think Quest.</ref>  Given a surface through which a metal wire passes, electrons move in both directions across the surface at an equal rate. As [[George Gamow]] wrote in his [[popular science]] book, ''[[One, Two, Three...Infinity]]'' (1947), \"The metallic substances differ from all other materials by the fact that the outer shells of their atoms are bound rather loosely, and often let one of their electrons go free. Thus the interior of a metal is filled up with a large number of unattached electrons that travel aimlessly around like a crowd of displaced persons. When a metal wire is subjected to electric force applied on its opposite ends, these free electrons rush in the direction of the force, thus forming what we call an electric current.\"\n\nWhen a metal wire is connected across the two terminals of a [[Direct current|DC]] [[voltage source]] such as a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], the source places an electric field across the conductor. The moment contact is made, the free electrons of the conductor are forced to drift toward the [[Positive (electricity)|positive]] terminal under the influence of this field. The free electrons are therefore the [[charge carrier]] in a typical solid conductor.\n\nFor a steady flow of charge through a surface, the current ''I'' (in amperes) can be calculated with the following equation:\n:<math>I = {Q \\over t} \\, ,</math>\nwhere ''Q'' is the electric charge transferred through the surface over a [[time]] ''t''.  If ''Q'' and ''t'' are measured in [[coulomb]]s and seconds respectively, ''I'' is in amperes.\n\nMore generally, electric current can be represented as the rate at which charge flows through a given surface as:\n:<math>I = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}Q}{\\mathrm{d}t} \\, .</math>\n\n===Electrolytes===\n{{main|Conductivity (electrolytic)}}\nElectric currents in [[electrolyte]]s are flows of electrically charged particles ([[ion]]s). For example, if an electric field is placed across a solution of [[sodium|Na]]<sup>+</sup> and [[chlorine|Cl]]<sup>\u2212</sup> (and conditions are right) the sodium ions move towards the negative electrode (cathode), while the chloride ions move towards the positive electrode (anode). Reactions take place at both electrode surfaces, absorbing each ion.\n\nWater-ice and certain solid electrolytes called [[proton conductor]]s contain positive hydrogen ions (\"[[proton]]s\") that are mobile. In these materials, electric currents are composed of moving protons, as opposed to the moving electrons in metals.\n\nIn certain electrolyte mixtures, brightly coloured ions are the moving electric charges. The slow progress of the colour makes the current visible.<ref>Rudolf Holze, [https://books.google.com/books?id=TbcDvDcDFB0C&pg=PA44#v=onepage&q&f=true ''Experimental Electrochemistry: A Laboratory Textbook''], page 44, John Wiley & Sons, 2009 {{ISBN|3527310983}}.</ref>\n\n===Gases and plasmas===\nIn air and other ordinary [[gas]]es below the breakdown field, the dominant source of electrical conduction is via relatively few mobile ions produced by radioactive gases, ultraviolet light, or cosmic rays. Since the electrical conductivity is low, gases are [[dielectric]]s or [[Electrical insulation|insulator]]s. However, once the applied [[electric field]] approaches the [[dielectric breakdown|breakdown]] value, free electrons become sufficiently accelerated by the electric field to create additional free electrons by colliding, and [[ionizing]], neutral gas atoms or molecules in a process called [[avalanche breakdown]]. The breakdown process forms a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] that contains enough mobile electrons and positive ions to make it an electrical conductor. In the process, it forms a light emitting conductive path, such as a [[Electrostatic discharge|spark]], [[electric arc|arc]] or [[lightning]].\n\n[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]] is the state of matter where some of the electrons in a gas are stripped or \"ionized\" from their [[molecule]]s or atoms. A plasma can be formed by high [[temperature]], or by application of a high electric or alternating magnetic field as noted above. Due to their lower mass, the electrons in a plasma accelerate more quickly in response to an electric field than the heavier positive ions, and hence carry the bulk of the current. The free ions recombine to create new chemical compounds (for example, breaking atmospheric oxygen into single oxygen [O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2O], which then recombine creating [[ozone]] [O<sub>3</sub>]).<ref>{{cite web | title = Lab Note #106 ''Environmental Impact of Arc Suppression'' | publisher = Arc Suppression Technologies | date = April 2011 | url = http://www.arcsuppressiontechnologies.com/arc-suppression-facts/lab-app-notes/ | accessdate = March 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Vacuum===\nSince a \"[[free space|perfect vacuum]]\" contains no charged particles, it normally behaves as a perfect insulator. However, metal electrode surfaces can cause a region of the vacuum to become conductive by injecting free electrons or [[ion]]s through either [[field electron emission]] or [[thermionic emission]]. Thermionic emission occurs when the thermal energy exceeds the metal's [[work function]], while [[field electron emission]] occurs when the electric field at the surface of the metal is high enough to cause [[quantum tunneling|tunneling]], which results in the ejection of free electrons from the metal into the vacuum. Externally heated electrodes are often used to generate an [[electron cloud]] as in the [[electrical filament|filament]] or indirectly [[hot cathode|heated cathode]] of [[vacuum tube]]s. [[cold cathode|Cold electrodes]] can also spontaneously produce electron clouds via thermionic emission when small incandescent regions (called '''cathode spots''' or '''anode spots''') are formed. These are incandescent regions of the electrode surface that are created by a localized high current. These regions may be initiated by [[field electron emission]], but are then sustained by localized thermionic emission once a [[vacuum arc]] forms. These small electron-emitting regions can form quite rapidly, even explosively, on a metal surface subjected to a high electrical field. [[Vacuum tube]]s and [[Krytron|sprytron]]s are some of the electronic switching and amplifying devices based on vacuum conductivity.\n\n===Superconductivity===\n{{main|Superconductivity}}\n\nSuperconductivity is a phenomenon of exactly zero [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] and expulsion of [[magnetic field]]s occurring in certain materials when [[cryogenics|cooled]] below a characteristic [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical temperature]]. It was discovered by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]] on April&nbsp;8, 1911 in [[Leiden]]. Like [[ferromagnetism]] and [[atomic spectral line]]s, superconductivity is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon. It is characterized by the [[Meissner effect]], the complete ejection of [[magnetic field|magnetic field lines]] from the interior of the superconductor as it transitions into the superconducting state. The occurrence of the Meissner effect indicates that superconductivity cannot be understood simply as the idealization of ''[[perfect conductor|perfect conductivity]]'' in [[classical physics]].\n\n===Semiconductor===\n{{main|Semiconductor}}\n\nIn a [[semiconductor]] it is sometimes useful to think of the current as due to the flow of positive \"[[electron hole|holes]]\" (the mobile positive charge carriers that are places where the semiconductor crystal is missing a valence electron). This is the case in a p-type semiconductor. A semiconductor has [[electrical conductivity]] intermediate in magnitude between that of a [[Electrical Conductor|conductor]] and an [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator]].  This means a conductivity roughly in the range of 10<sup>\u22122</sup>  to 10<sup>4</sup> [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]] per centimeter (S\u22c5cm<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nIn the classic crystalline semiconductors, electrons can have energies only within certain bands (i.e. ranges of levels of energy).   Energetically,  these bands are located between the energy of the ground state, the state in which electrons are tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, the latter describing the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. The energy bands each correspond to a large number of discrete [[quantum state]]s of the electrons, and most of the states with low energy (closer to the nucleus) are occupied, up to a particular band called the ''[[valence band]]''. Semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from [[metals]] because the valence band in any given metal is nearly filled with electrons under usual operating conditions, while very few (semiconductor) or virtually none (insulator) of them are available in the ''conduction band'', the band immediately above the valence band.\n\nThe ease of exciting electrons in the semiconductor from the valence band to the conduction band depends on the [[band gap]] between the bands.  The size of this energy band gap serves as an arbitrary dividing line (roughly 4 [[electronvolt|eV]]) between semiconductors and [[Electrical insulation|insulators]].\n\nWith covalent bonds, an electron moves by hopping to a neighboring bond.  The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] requires that the electron be lifted into the higher anti-bonding state of that bond.   For delocalized states, for example in one dimension \u2013 that is in a [[nanowire]], for every energy there is a state with electrons flowing in one direction and another state with the electrons flowing in the other. For a net current to flow, more states for one direction than for the other direction must be occupied. For this to occur, energy is required, as in the semiconductor the next higher states lie above the band gap. Often this is stated as: full bands do not contribute to the [[electrical conductivity]]. However, as a semiconductor's temperature rises above [[absolute zero]], there is more energy in the semiconductor to spend on lattice vibration and on exciting electrons into the conduction band. The current-carrying electrons in the conduction band are known as ''free electrons'', though they are often simply called ''electrons'' if that is clear in context.\n\n==Current density and Ohm's law==\n\n{{Main|Current density}}\nCurrent density is a measure of the density of an electric current. It is defined as a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] whose magnitude is the electric current per cross-sectional area. In [[SI|SI units]], the current density is measured in amperes per square metre.\n:<math>I=\\int\\vec J\\cdot d\\vec A</math>\n\nwhere ''<math>I</math>'' is current in the conductor, '''<math>\\vec J</math>''' is the current density, and '''<math>d\\vec A </math>''' is the differential cross-sectional area vector.\n\nThe current density (current per unit area) ''<math>\\vec J</math>'' in materials with finite [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] is directly proportional to the [[electric field]] <math>\\vec E</math> in the medium. The proportionality constant is called the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] ''<math>\\sigma</math>''  of the material, whose value depends on the material concerned and, in general, is dependent on the temperature of the material:\n:<math>\\vec J = \\sigma \\vec E\\,</math>\n\nThe reciprocal of the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] ''<math>\\sigma</math>'' of the material is called the [[electrical resistivity|resistivity]] ''<math>\\rho</math>'' of the material and the above equation, when written in terms of resistivity becomes:\n:<math>\\vec J = \\frac {\\vec E}{\\rho}</math> or\n:<math>\\vec E=\\rho\\vec J</math>\n\nConduction in [[semiconductor device]]s may occur by a combination of drift and diffusion, which is proportional to [[diffusion constant]] <math>D</math> and [[charge density]] <math>\\alpha_q</math>. The current density is then:\n:<math>J =\\sigma E + D q \\nabla n,</math>\n\nwith <math>q</math> being the [[elementary charge]] and <math>n</math> the electron density. The carriers move in the direction of decreasing concentration, so for electrons a positive current results for a positive density gradient. If the carriers are holes, replace electron density <math>n</math> by the negative of the [[electron hole|hole]] density <math>p</math>.\n\nIn linear [[anisotropy|anisotropic]] materials, ''\u03c3'', ''\u03c1'' and ''D'' are [[tensor]]s.\n\nIn linear materials such as metals, and under low frequencies, the current density across the conductor surface is uniform. In such conditions, [[Ohm's law]] states that the current is directly proportional to the potential difference between two ends (across) of that metal (ideal) [[resistor]] (or other [[ohmic device]]):\n:<math>I = {V \\over R} \\, ,</math>\n\nwhere <math>I</math> is the current, measured in amperes; <math>V</math> is the [[potential difference]], measured in [[volt]]s; and <math>R</math> is the [[electrical resistance|resistance]], measured in [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s. For [[alternating current]]s, especially at higher frequencies, [[skin effect]] causes the current to spread unevenly across the conductor cross-section, with higher density near the surface, thus increasing the apparent resistance.\n\n== Drift speed ==\nThe mobile charged particles within a conductor move constantly in random directions, like the particles of a [[gas]].  (More accurately, a [[Fermi gas]].) To create a net flow of charge, the particles must also move together with an average drift rate. Electrons are the charge carriers in most [[metal]]s and they follow an erratic path, bouncing from atom to atom, but generally drifting in the opposite direction of the electric field. The speed they drift at can be calculated from the equation:\n:<math>I=nAvQ \\, ,</math>\nwhere\n:<math>I</math> is the electric current\n:<math>n</math> is number of charged particles per unit volume (or charge carrier density)\n:<math>A</math> is the cross-sectional area of the conductor\n:<math>v</math> is the [[drift velocity]], and\n:<math>Q</math> is the charge on each particle.\nTypically, electric charges in solids flow slowly.  For example, in a [[copper]] wire of cross-section 0.5&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>, carrying a current of 5&nbsp;A, the [[drift velocity]] of the electrons is on the order of a millimetre per second. To take a different example, in the near-vacuum inside a [[cathode ray tube]], the electrons travel in near-straight lines at about a tenth of the [[speed of light]].\n\nAny accelerating electric charge, and therefore any changing electric current, gives rise to an [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] wave that propagates at very high speed outside the surface of the conductor.  This speed is usually a significant fraction of the speed of light, as can be deduced from [[Maxwell's Equations]], and is therefore many times faster than the drift velocity of the electrons. For example, in [[electric power transmission|AC power lines]], the waves of electromagnetic energy propagate through the space between the wires, moving from a source to a distant [[external electric load|load]], even though the electrons in the wires only move back and forth over a tiny distance.\n\nThe ratio of the speed of the electromagnetic wave to the speed of light in free space is called the [[velocity factor]], and depends on the electromagnetic properties of the conductor and the insulating materials surrounding it, and on their shape and size.\n\nThe magnitudes (not the natures) of these three velocities can be illustrated by an analogy with the three similar velocities associated with gases. (See also [[hydraulic analogy]].)\n*The low drift velocity of charge carriers is analogous to air motion; in other words, winds.\n*The high speed of electromagnetic waves is roughly analogous to the speed of sound in a gas (sound waves move through air much faster than large-scale motions such as [[convection]])\n*The random motion of charges is analogous to heat \u2013 the thermal velocity of randomly vibrating gas particles.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Wiktionary|amperage}}\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Alternating current]]\n*[[Current 3-vector]]\n*[[Direct current]]\n*[[Electric shock]]\n*[[Electrical measurements]]\n*[[History of electrical engineering]]\n*[[Hydraulic analogy]]\n* [[International System of Quantities]]\n*[[SI electromagnetism units]]\n* [[Single-phase electric power]]\n* [[Two-phase electric power]]\n* [[Three-phase electric power]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{SI base quantities}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Electric Current}}\n[[Category:Electric current| ]]\n[[Category:SI base quantities]]", "sha1": "i83kinylxhcfrnxcffpp94i2w1raf06"}}, {"title": "Charles Ancillon", "ns": "0", "id": "6208", "revision": {"id": "862715926", "parentid": "782506206", "timestamp": "2018-10-06T06:19:26Z", "contributor": {"username": "Cydebot", "id": "1215485"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Robot - Removing category German people of Huguenot descent per [[WP:CFD|CFD]] at [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2018 September 27]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox person\n | name             =\n | image            = Charles Ancillon (1659-1715).jpg\n | imagesize        =\n | caption          =\n | birth_name       =\n | birth_date       = 28 July 1659\n | birth_place      = [[Metz]]\n | death_date       = {{Death date and age|df=yes|1715|07|05|1659|07|28}}\n | death_place      = Berlin\n | othername   =\n | occupation  = Diplomat<br>Jurist\n | years_active     =\n | spouse           =\n | signature        =\n}}\n\n'''Charles Ancillon''' (28 July 1659{{snd}}5 July 1715)<ref name=Brit>\"Ancillon, Charles\" in ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''.

At the request of the Huguenots at Metz, he pleaded its cause at the court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], urging that it should be excepted in the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]], but his efforts were unsuccessful, and he joined his father in Berlin. He was at once appointed by Elector [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] \"''juge et directeur de colonie de Berlin''.\" Before this, he had published several works on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes and its consequences, but his literary capacity was mediocre, his style stiff and cold, and it was his personal character rather than his reputation as a writer that earned him the confidence of the elector.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1687 Ancillon was appointed head of the so-called ''Academie des nobles,'' the principal educational establishment of the state; later on, as councillor of embassy, he took part in the negotiations which led to the assumption of the title of \"[[King in Prussia]]\" by the elector.  In 1699 he succeeded [[Samuel Pufendorf]] as historiographer to the elector, and the same year replaced his uncle [[Joseph Ancillon]] as judge of all the French refugees in the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nAncillon is mainly remembered for what he did for education in [[Brandenburg-Prussia]],  and the share he took, in co-operation with [[Gottfried Leibniz]], in founding the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Berlin]].

He achieved early local recognition, largely through the enthusiasm of [[George Sterling]], for traditional verse in the vein of [[Swinburne]]. As a poet, Smith is grouped with the West Coast Romantics alongside [[Joaquin Miller]], Sterling, [[Nora May French]], and remembered as \"The Last of the Great Romantics\" and \"The Bard of Auburn\".\n\nSmith was one of \"the big three of ''[[Weird Tales]]'', with [[Robert E. Howard]] and [[H. P. Lovecraft]]\",<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=G. W.|title=A Reader's Guide to Sword & Sorcery S-V|url=http://www.gwthomas.org/ssrgsv.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528033423/http://www.gwthomas.org/ssrgsv.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=May 28, 2010|accessdate=September 27, 2012}}</ref> but some readers objected to his morbidness and violation of pulp traditions. The fantasy critic [[L. Sprague de Camp]] said of him that \"nobody since [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]] has so loved a well-rotted corpse.\"<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 206</ref> Smith was a member of the Lovecraft circle and his literary friendship with Lovecraft lasted from 1922 until Lovecraft's death in 1937. His work is marked by an extraordinarily rich and ornate vocabulary, a cosmic perspective and a vein of sardonic and sometimes ribald humor.\n\nOf his writing style, Smith stated that: \"My own conscious ideal has been to delude the reader into accepting an impossibility, or series of impossibilities, by means of a sort of verbal black magic, in the achievement of which I make use of prose-rhythm, metaphor, simile, tone-color, counter-point, and other stylistic resources, like a sort of incantation.\"<ref>[http://www.eldritchdark.com/articles/reviews/68/introduction-to-%27tales-of-zothique%27 Eldritchdark.com]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and education===\n\nSmith was born January 13, 1893, in Long Valley, California, of English and New England parentage. He spent most of his life in the small town of [[Auburn, California]], living in a small cabin built by his parents, Fanny and Timeus Smith. His formal education was limited: he suffered from psychological disorders including a fear of crowds, and although admitted to high school after attending eight years of grammar school (Long Valley School, whence dates the earliest known photo of him), he never went to high school. His parents decided it was better for him to be educated at home.\n\nHowever, he was an insatiable reader, and continued to teach himself after he left school. His education began with the reading of ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' (unabridged), ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', the fairy tales of [[Hans Christian Andersen]] and [[Madame d'Aulnoy]], the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' and (at the age of 13) the poems of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He read an unabridged dictionary (the 13th edition of Webster's) through, word for word, studying not only the definitions of the words but also their derivations from ancient languages. Having an extraordinary [[eidetic memory]], he seems to have retained most or all of it.<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 197-98</ref>\n\nThe other main course in Smith's self-education was to read the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition]] of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' through at least twice.<ref>Behrends 1990, p. 5</ref> Smith later taught himself French and Spanish in order to translate verse out of those languages. Smith professed to hate the provinciality of the small town of Auburn but rarely left it until he married late in life.\n\n===Early writing ===\n[[File:Clark Ashton Smith WS 3010.jpg|thumb|right|Smith as depicted in ''[[Wonder Stories]]'' in 1930]]\n\nHis first literary efforts, at the age of 11, took the form of fairy tales and imitations of the Arabian Nights. Later, he wrote long adventure novels dealing with Oriental life. By 14 he had already written a short adventure novel called ''The Black Diamonds'' which was lost for years until published in 2002. Another juvenile novel was written in his teenaged years\u2014''[[The Sword of Zagan]]'' (unpublished until 2004). Like ''The Black Diamonds'', it uses a [[Middle Ages|medieval]], ''Arabian Nights''-like setting, and the ''Arabian Nights'', like the fairy tales of the [[Brothers Grimm]] and the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe]], are known to have strongly influenced Smith's early writing, as did [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s ''[[Vathek]]''.\n\nAt age 17, he sold several tales to ''[[The Black Cat (magazine)|The Black Cat]]'', a magazine which specialized in unusual tales. He also published some tales in the ''[[Overland Monthly]]'' in this brief foray into fiction which preceded his poetic career.\n\nHowever, it was primarily poetry that motivated the young Smith and he confined his efforts to poetry for more than a decade. In his later youth, Smith made the acquaintance of the San Francisco poet [[George Sterling]] through a member of the local [[Auburn Monday Night Club]], where he read several of his poems with considerable success. On a month-long visit to Sterling in [[Carmel, California]], Smith was introduced by Sterling to the poetry of [[Baudelaire]].<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 200</ref>\n\nHe became Sterling's [[prot\u00e9g\u00e9]] and Sterling helped him to publish his first volume of poems, ''[[The Star-Treader and Other Poems]]'', at the age of 19. Smith received international acclaim for the collection. ''[[The Star-Treader]]'' was received very favorably by American critics, one of whom named Smith \"the [[John Keats|Keats]] of the Pacific\". Smith briefly moved among the circle that included [[Ambrose Bierce]] and [[Jack London]], but his early fame soon faded away.\n\n===Health breakdown period===\n\nA little later, Smith's health broke down and for eight years his literary production was intermittent, though he produced his best poetry during this period. A small volume, ''Odes and Sonnets'', was brought out in 1918. Smith came into contact with literary figures who would later form part of H.P. Lovecraft's circle of correspondents; Smith knew them far earlier than Lovecraft. These figures include poet [[Samuel Loveman]] and bookman George Kirk. It was Smith who in fact later introduced [[Donald Wandrei]] to Lovecraft. For this reason, it has been suggested that Lovecraft might as well be referred to as a member of a \"Smith\" circle as Smith was a member of a Lovecraft one.<ref>Schultz & Connors 2003, p. xix</ref>\n\nIn 1920 Smith composed a celebrated long poem in [[blank verse]], ''The Hashish Eater, or The Apocalypse of Evil'' which was published in ''[[Ebony and Crystal]]'' (1922).<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith |first=Clark Ashton |title=Ebony and Crystal: Poems in Verse and Prose |year=1922 |location=[[Auburn, California]]}}</ref> This was followed by a fan letter from [[H. P. Lovecraft]], which was the beginning of 15 years of friendship and correspondence. With studied playfulness, Smith and Lovecraft borrowed each other's coinages of place names and the names of strange gods for their stories, though so different is Smith's treatment of the Lovecraft theme that it has been dubbed the \"Clark Ashton Smythos.\"<ref>Murray 1990</ref>\n\nIn 1925 Smith published ''Sandalwood'', which was partly funded by a gift of $50 from [[Donald Wandrei]]. He wrote little fiction in this period with the exception of some imaginative vignettes or [[prose poem]]s. Smith was poor for most of his life and often did hard manual jobs such as fruit picking and [[woodcutting]] in order to support himself and his parents. He was an able cook and made many kinds of wine. He also did well digging, typing and journalism, as well as contributing a column to ''The Auburn Journal'' and sometimes worked as its night editor.<ref>de Camp 1976, p. 203</ref>\n\nOne of Smith's artistic patrons and frequent correspondents was San Francisco businessman [[Albert M. Bender]].\n\n===Prolific fiction-writing period===\nAt the beginning of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] in 1929, with his aged parents' health weakening, Smith resumed fiction writing and turned out more than a hundred short stories between 1929 and 1934, nearly all of which can be classed as weird horror or science fiction. Like Lovecraft, he drew upon the nightmares that had plagued him during youthful spells of sickness. [[Brian Stableford]] has written that the stories written during this brief phase of hectic productivity \"constitute one of the most remarkable oeuvres in imaginative literature\".<ref>Brian Stableford, \"Clark Ashton Smith\" in David Pringle (ed), ''St James Guide to Fantasy Writers'', Detroit MI: St James Press, 1996, pp.529-30</ref>\n\nHe published at his own expense a volume containing six of his best stories, ''The Double Shadow and Other Fantasies'', in an edition of 1000 copies printed by the ''Auburn Journal''. The theme of much of his work is egotism and its supernatural punishment; his weird fiction is generally macabre in subject matter, gloatingly preoccupied with images of death, decay and abnormality.\n\nMost of Smith's weird fiction falls into four series set variously in [[Hyperborean cycle|Hyperborea]], [[Poseidonis]], [[Averoigne]] and [[Zothique]]. Hyperborea, which is a lost continent of the Miocene period, and Poseidonis, which is a remnant of Atlantis, are much the same, with a magical culture characterized by bizarreness, cruelty, death and postmortem horrors. Averoigne is Smith's version of pre-modern France, comparable to [[James Branch Cabell]]'s Poictesme. Zothique exists millions of years in the future. It is \"the last continent of earth, when the sun is dim and tarnished\". These tales have been compared to the ''Dying Earth'' sequence of [[Jack Vance]].\n\nIn 1933 Smith began corresponding with [[Robert E. Howard]], the Texan creator of [[Conan the Barbarian]]. From 1933 to 1936, Smith, Howard and Lovecraft were the leaders of the [[Weird Tales]] school of fiction and corresponded frequently, although they never met. The writer of oriental fantasies [[E. Hoffmann Price]] is the only man known to have met all three in the flesh.\n\nCritic Steve Behrends has suggested that the frequent theme of 'loss' in Smith's fiction (many of his characters attempt to recapture a long-vanished youth, early love, or picturesque past) may reflect Smith's own feeling that his career had suffered a \"fall from grace\":\n{{quote|Smith's late teens and early twenties had certainly been a heady period: he'd been taken under the wing of a personal, idol, the poet George Sterling, and his first book of poetry had brought him comparisons to Keats and Shelley. This notoriety must surely have raised his standing in his small hometown. And yet the depression found Smith without a job or viable occupation, unable to eke out a living as a poet, with girlfriends berating him for his lack of ambition. And while his turn to writing fiction did put bread on the table, he found it a very distasteful business at times\u2014he had once said to Sterling that writing prose was \"a hateful task, for a poet, and [one which] wouldn't be necessary in any true civilisation.\" In short, it may be that Smith experienced that variety of \"let-down\" or loss peculiar to the child prodigies.<ref>Steve Behrends. \"The Song of the Necromancer: 'Loss' in Clark Ashton Smith's Fiction\". ''Studies in Weird Fiction'' 1, No 1 (Summer 1986), 3\u201312.</ref>}}\n\n===Mid-late career: return to poetry and sculpture===\n\nIn September 1935, Smith's mother Fanny died. Smith spent the next two years nursing his father through his last illness. Timeus died in December 1937. Aged 44, Smith now virtually ceased writing fiction. He had been severely affected by several tragedies occurring in a short period of time: [[Robert E. Howard]]'s death by suicide (1936), Lovecraft's death from cancer (1937) and the deaths of his parents, which left him exhausted. As a result, he withdrew from the scene, marking the end of ''Weird Tales''' [[Golden Age]]. He began sculpting and resumed the writing of poetry. However, Smith was visited by many writers at his cabin, including [[Fritz Leiber]], [[Rah Hoffman]], [[Francis T. Laney]] and others.\n\nIn 1942, three years after [[August Derleth]] founded [[Arkham House]] for the purpose of preserving the work of H.P. Lovecraft, Derleth published the first of several major collections of Smith's fiction, ''Out of Space and Time'' (1942). This was followed by ''Lost Worlds'' (1944). The books sold slowly, went out of print and became costly rarities. Derleth published five more volumes of Smith's prose and two of his verse, and at his death in 1971 had a large volume of Smith's poems in press.\n\n===Later life, marriage and death===\n\nIn 1953 Smith suffered a coronary attack. Aged 61, he married Carol(yn) Jones Dorman on November 10, 1954. Dorman had much experience in Hollywood and radio public relations. After honeymooning at the Smith cabin, they moved to [[Pacific Grove, California]], where he set up a household with their children. (Carol had been married before and had three children). For several years he alternated between the house on Indian Ridge and his wife's house in Pacific Grove. Having sold most of his father's tract, in 1957 the old house burned\u2014the Smiths believed by arson, others said by accident.\n\nSmith now reluctantly did gardening for other residents at Pacific Grove, and grew a goatee. He spent much time shopping and walking near the seafront but despite Derleth's badgering, resisted the writing of more fiction.<ref>Haefele 2010, p.170</ref> In 1961 he suffered strokes. In August 1961 he quietly died in his sleep, aged 68. After Smith's death Carol remarried (becoming Carolyn Wakefield) and subsequently died of cancer.\n\nThe poet's ashes were buried beside, or beneath, a boulder to the immediate west of where his childhood home (destroyed by fire in 1957) stood; some were also scattered in a stand of blue oaks near the boulder. There was no marker. Plaques recognizing Smith have been erected at the Auburn Placer County Library in 1985 and in Bicentennial Park in Auburn in 2003.<ref>[http://alangullette.com/lit/smith/sorcerer.htm Alan Gullette]</ref>\n\nBookseller [[Roy A. Squires]] was appointed Smith's \"west coast executor\", with [[Jack L. Chalker]] as his \"east coast executor\".<ref>Haefele 2010, p.172</ref> Squires published many letterpress editions of individual Smith poems.\n\nSmith's literary estate is represented by his stepson, Prof William Dorman, director of CASiana Literary Enterprises. [[Arkham House]] owns the copyright to many Smith stories, though some are now in the public domain.\n\nFor 'posthumous collaborations' of Smith (stories completed by Lin Carter), see the entry on [[Lin Carter]].\n\n==Artistic periods==\n\nWhile Smith was always an artist who worked in several very different media, it is possible to identify three distinct periods in which one form of art had precedence over the others.\n\n===Poetry: until 1925===\nSmith published most of his volumes of poetry in this period, including the aforementioned ''[[The Star-Treader and Other Poems]]'', as well as ''[[Odes and Sonnets]]'' (1918), ''[[Ebony and Crystal]]'' (1922) and ''Sandalwood'' (1925). His [[long poem]] ''[[The Hashish-Eater; Or, the Apocalypse of Evil]]'' was written in 1920.\n\n===Weird fiction: 1926\u20131935===\n\n[[File:Strange tales 193210.jpg|thumb|\"The Hunters from Beyond\", one of Clark Ashton Smith's best-known stories, was first published in the October 1932 issue of ''[[Strange Tales (pulp magazine)|Strange Tales]]''.]]\n\nSmith wrote most of his [[weird fiction]] and [[Cthulhu Mythos]] stories, partially inspired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]. Creatures of his invention include [[Aforgomon]], [[Rlim-Shaikorth]], [[Mordiggian]], [[Tsathoggua]], the wizard [[Eibon]], and various others. In an homage to his friend, Lovecraft referred in \"The Whisperer in Darkness\" and \"The Battle That Ended the Century\" (written in collaboration with R. H. Barlow) to an Atlantean high-priest, \"Klarkash-Ton.\"\n\nSmith's weird stories form several cycles, called after the lands in which they are set: [[Averoigne]], [[Hyperborean cycle|Hyperborea]], [[Mars in fiction|Mars]], [[Poseidonis]], [[Zothique]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackgate.com/articles/zothique.htm |title=The Fantasy Cycles of Clark Ashton Smith PART III: Tales of Zothique |last=Harvey |first=Ryan |publisher=[[Black Gate (magazine)|Black Gate]] |date=April 9, 2008 |accessdate=September 16, 2013}}</ref> To some extent Smith was influenced in his vision of such lost worlds by the teachings of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] and the writings of [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Stories set in Zothique belong to the [[Dying Earth subgenre]]. Amongst Smith's science fiction tales are stories set on [[Mars]] and the invented planet of [[Xiccarph]].\n\nHis short stories originally appeared in the magazines ''[[Weird Tales]]'', ''[[Strange Tales]]'', ''[[Astounding Stories]]'', ''[[Science fiction magazine|Stirring Science Stories]]'' and ''[[Wonder Stories]]''.\n\nClark Ashton Smith was the third member of the great triumvirate of ''Weird Tales'', with Lovecraft and [[Robert E.

In the late 1950s Smith recorded a number of his poems on the taperecorder of his friend Robert B. Elder. Elder chose the 11 poems at random from Smith's books ''The Dark Chateau'' and \"Spells and Philtres\". (Elder had first met Smith when reporting on his 1954 wedding to the former Carol Dorman for ''The Auburn Courier'' and they became friends when Smith praised Elder's novel ''Whom the Gods Destroy''.) In 1995 Necronomicon Press released the audiocassette ''Clark Ashton Smith: Live from Auburn: The Elder Tapes'', which includes an introduction by Elder and then Smith reading his poems. The recording was produced by Wayne Haigh. The cassette was accompanied by a booklet feasturing a c.1960 photo of Smith and reprints all 11 poems. [[Gahan Wilson]] provided the cover art for cassette and booklet. The recording has not been released on CD.    \n*\"The Double Shadow\" was filmed by Azathoth Productions on Super 8 film in 1975 with a script by [[Leigh Blackmore]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.optusnet.com.au/lvxnox/pastprojects.html |title=Past Projects |last=Blackmore |first=Leigh |authorlink=Leigh Blackmore |accessdate=September 18, 2013 |quote=There is mention here of Azathoth productions, a filmmaking group within the [Horror Fantasy Society].

The addition of the empty string allows the statement that the context sensitive languages are a proper superset of the context-free languages, rather than having to make the weaker statement that all context-free grammars with no \u2192\u03bb productions are also context sensitive grammars.\n\nThe name ''context-sensitive'' is explained by the \u03b1 and \u03b2 that form the context of ''A'' and determine whether ''A'' can be replaced with \u03b3 or not. This is different from a [[context-free grammar]] where the context of a nonterminal is not taken into consideration. Indeed, every production of a context-free grammar is of the form ''V'' \u2192 ''w'' where ''V'' is a ''single'' nonterminal symbol, and ''w'' is a string of terminals and/or nonterminals; ''w'' can be empty.\n\nIf the possibility of adding the empty string to a language is added to the strings recognized by the noncontracting grammars (which can never include the empty string) then the languages in these two definitions are identical.\n\nThe '''left-context'''- and '''right-context'''-sensitive grammars are defined by restricting the rules to just the form \u03b1''A'' \u2192 \u03b1\u03b3 and to just ''A''\u03b2 \u2192 \u03b3\u03b2, respectively.

However this does not necessarily imply that all the class CSG is necessary to capture \"context sensitivity\" in the colloquial sense of these terms in natural languages. For example, the strictly weaker (than CSG) [[linear context-free rewriting system]]s (LCFRS) can account for the phenomenon of cross-serial dependencies; one can write a LCFRS grammar for {''a<sup>n</sup>b<sup>n</sup>c<sup>n</sup>d<sup>n</sup>'' | ''n'' \u2265 1} for example.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~kallmeyer/GrammarFormalisms/4nl-cfg.pdf|title=Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar Formalisms: Natural Languages are not Context-Free|first=Laura|last=Kallmeyer|year=2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://user.phil-fak.uni-duesseldorf.de/~kallmeyer/GrammarFormalisms/4lcfrs-intro.pdf|title=Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar Formalisms: Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems|first=Laura|last=Kallmeyer|year=2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Kallmeyer2010\">{{cite book|first=Laura|last=Kallmeyer|title=Parsing Beyond Context-Free Grammars|year=2010|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-14846-0|pages=1\u20135}}</ref>\n\nOngoing research on [[computational linguistics]] has focused on formulating other classes of languages that are \"[[mildly context-sensitive language|mildly context-sensitive]]\" whose decision problems are feasible, such as [[tree-adjoining grammar]]s, [[combinatory categorial grammar]]s, [[coupled context-free language]]s, and [[Generalized context-free grammar#Linear Context-free Rewriting Systems (LCFRSs)|linear context-free rewriting system]]s.

The argument was first presented by philosopher [[John Searle]] in his paper, \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]'' in 1980.

Specifically, the argument is intended to refute a position Searle calls '''Strong AI''':\n<blockquote>The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.{{efn|name=\"Strong AI\"}}</blockquote>\n\nAlthough it was originally presented in reaction to the statements of [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) researchers, it is not an argument against the goals of AI research, because it does not limit the amount of intelligence a machine can display.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The argument applies only to digital computers running programs and does not apply to machines in general.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}}\n\n==Chinese room thought experiment==\n[[File:John searle2.jpg|thumb|John Searle]]\nSearle's [[thought experiment]] begins with this hypothetical premise: suppose that [[artificial intelligence]] research has succeeded in constructing a computer that behaves as if it understands [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. It takes [[Chinese character]]s as input and, by following the instructions of a [[computer program]], produces other Chinese characters, which it presents as output. Suppose, says Searle, that this computer performs its task so convincingly that it comfortably passes the [[Turing test]]: it convinces a human Chinese speaker that the program is itself a live Chinese speaker. To all of the questions that the person asks, it makes appropriate responses, such that any Chinese speaker would be convinced that they are talking to another Chinese-speaking human being.\n\nThe question Searle wants to answer is this: does the machine ''literally'' \"understand\" Chinese? Or is it merely ''simulating'' the ability to understand Chinese?{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}{{efn|Searle writes that \"according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.\"{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}} He also writes:  \"On the Strong AI view, the appropriately programmed computer does not just simulate having a mind; it literally has a mind.\"{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=66}}}} Searle calls the first position \"[[#Strong AI|strong AI]]\" and the latter \"weak AI\".{{efn|name=\"Strong AI in Searle (1980)\" | \nSearle writes:  \"Partisans of strong AI claim that in this question and answer sequence the machine is not only simulating a human ability but also (1) that the machine can literally be said to ''understand'' the story and provide the answers to questions, and (2) that what the machine and its program ''explains'' the human ability to understand the story and answer questions about it.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=2}}\n}}\n\nSearle then supposes that he is in a closed room and has a book with an English version of the computer program, along with sufficient papers, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, that he would do so as well, simply by running the program manually.\n\nSearle asserts that there is no essential difference between the roles of the computer and himself in the experiment. Each simply follows a program, step-by-step, producing a behavior which is then interpreted as demonstrating intelligent conversation. However, Searle would not be able to understand the conversation. (\"I don't speak a word of Chinese,\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}} he points out.)  Therefore, he argues, it follows that the computer would not be able to understand the conversation either.\n\nSearle argues that, without \"understanding\" (or \"[[intentionality]]\"), we cannot describe what the machine is doing as \"thinking\" and, since it does not think, it does not have a \"mind\" in anything like the normal sense of the word. Therefore, he concludes that \"strong AI\" is false.\n\n==History==\n[[Gottfried Leibniz]] made a similar argument in 1714 against [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]] (the position that the mind is a machine and nothing more). Leibniz used the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a [[mill (factory)|mill]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.1}}, {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1714|loc=section 17}}</ref> Leibniz found it difficult to imagine that a \"mind\" capable of \"perception\" could be constructed using only mechanical processes.{{efn|Note that Leibniz' was objecting to a \"mechanical\" theory of the mind (the philosophical position known as [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]].) Searle is objecting to an \"information processing\" view of the mind (the philosophical position known as \"[[computationalism]]\"). Searle accepts mechanism and rejects computationalism.}} In 1974, [[Lawrence Davis]] imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 [[Ned Block]] envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called the [[China brain]], also the \"Chinese Nation\" or the \"Chinese Gym\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.3}}</ref>\n\nThe Chinese Room Argument was introduced in Searle's 1980 paper \"Minds, Brains, and Programs\", published in ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1980}} It eventually became the journal's \"most influential target article\",{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=1}} generating an enormous number of commentaries and responses in the ensuing decades, and Searle has continued to defend and refine the argument in many papers, popular articles and books. David Cole writes that \"the Chinese Room argument has probably been the most widely discussed philosophical argument in cognitive science to appear in the past 25 years\".<ref>{{harvnb|Cole|2004|p=2}}; {{harvnb|Preston|Bishop|2002}}</ref>\n\nMost of the discussion consists of attempts to refute it. \"The overwhelming majority,\" notes ''[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences|BBS]]'' editor [[Stevan Harnad]],{{efn|[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]] edited ''BBS'' during the years which saw the introduction and popularisation of the Chinese Room argument.}} \"still think that the Chinese Room Argument is dead wrong.\"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=2}} The sheer volume of the literature that has grown up around it inspired [[Patrick J.

Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]]: \"The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}}}</blockquote>\nThe definition hinges on the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''actually having'' a mind. Searle writes that \"according to Strong AI, the correct simulation really is a mind. According to Weak AI, the correct simulation is a model of the mind.\"{{sfn|Searle|2009|p=1}}\n\nThe position is implicit in some of the statements of early AI researchers and analysts. For example, in 1955, AI founder [[Herbert A. Simon]] declared that \"there are now in the world machines that think, that learn and create\"<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=21}}.</ref>{{efn|Simon, together with [[Allen Newell]] and [[Cliff Shaw]], had just completed the first \"AI\" program, the [[Logic Theorist]].}} and claimed that they had \"solved the venerable [[mind\u2013body problem]], explaining how a system composed of matter can have the properties of [[mind]].\"<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=46}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=17}}.</ref> [[John Haugeland]] wrote that \"AI wants only the genuine article: ''machines with minds'', in the full and literal sense.

Because a computer program can accurately represent functional relationships as relationships between symbols, a computer can have mental phenomena if it runs the right program, according to functionalism.\n\n[[Stevan Harnad]] argues that Searle's depictions of strong AI can be reformulated as \"recognizable tenets of ''computationalism'', a position (unlike \"strong AI\") that is actually held by many thinkers, and hence one worth refuting.\"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|loc=p. 3 (Italics his)}} [[Computationalism]]{{efn|[[Computationalism]] is associated with [[Jerry Fodor]] and [[Hilary Putnam]],{{sfn|Horst|2005|p=1}} and is held by [[Allen Newell]],{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} [[Zenon Pylyshyn]]{{sfn|Harnad|2001}} and [[Steven Pinker]],{{sfn|Pinker|1997}} among others.}} is the position in the philosophy of mind which argues that the [[mind]] can be accurately described as an [[information processing|information-processing]] system.\n\nEach of the following, according to Harnad, is a \"tenet\" of computationalism:{{sfn|Harnad|2001|pp=3\u20135}}\n* Mental states are computational states (which is why computers can have mental states and help to explain the mind);\n* Computational states are [[multiple realizability|implementation-independent]] \u2014 in other words, it is the software that determines the computational state, not the hardware (which is why the brain, being hardware, is irrelevant); and that\n* Since implementation is unimportant, the only empirical data that matters is how the system functions; hence the [[Turing test]] is definitive.\n\n===Strong AI vs. biological naturalism===\n\nSearle holds a philosophical position he calls \"[[biological naturalism]]\": that [[consciousness]]{{efn|name=Consciousness}} and [[intentionality|understanding]] require specific biological machinery that are found in brains. He writes \"brains cause minds\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} and that \"actual human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical\u2013chemical properties of actual human brains\".{{sfn|Searle|1990|p=29}} Searle argues that this machinery (known to [[neuroscience]] as the \"[[neural correlates of consciousness]]\") must have some (unspecified) \"causal powers\" that permit the human experience of consciousness.{{sfn|Searle|1990}} Searle's faith in the existence of these powers has been criticized.{{efn|See the replies to Searle under [[#Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness|Meaninglessness]], below}}\n\nSearle does not disagree with the notion that machines can have consciousness and understanding, because, as he writes, \"we are precisely such machines\".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=11}} Searle holds that the brain is, in fact, a machine, but that the brain gives rise to consciousness and understanding using machinery that is non-computational. If neuroscience is able to isolate the mechanical process that gives rise to consciousness, then Searle grants that it may be possible to create machines that have consciousness and understanding. However, without the specific machinery required, Searle does not believe that consciousness can occur.\n\nBiological naturalism implies that one cannot determine if the experience of consciousness is occurring merely by examining how a system functions, because the specific machinery of the brain is essential. Thus, biological naturalism is directly opposed to both [[behaviorism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] (including \"computer functionalism\" or \"strong AI\").{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} Biological naturalism is similar to [[identity theory of mind|identity theory]] (the position that mental states are \"identical to\" or \"composed of\" neurological events);  however, Searle has specific technical objections to identity theory.{{sfn|Searle|1992|loc=chpt. 5}}{{efn|Larry Hauser writes that \"biological naturalism is either confused (waffling between identity theory and dualism) or else it ''just is'' identity theory or dualism.\"{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}}}} Searle's biological naturalism and strong AI are both opposed to [[Cartesian dualism]],{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=8}} the classical idea that the brain and mind are made of different \"substances\". Indeed, Searle accuses strong AI of dualism, writing that \"strong AI only makes sense given the dualistic assumption that, where the mind is concerned, the brain doesn't matter.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}}\n\n===Consciousness===\nSearle's original presentation emphasized \"understanding\"\u2014that is, mental states with what philosophers call \"[[intentionality]]\"\u2014and did not directly address other closely related ideas such as \"consciousness\". However, in more recent presentations Searle has included consciousness as the real target of the argument.{{sfn|Searle|1992|p=44}}\n{{quote|Computational models of consciousness are not sufficient by themselves for consciousness. The computational model for consciousness stands to consciousness in the same way the computational model of anything stands to the domain being modelled. Nobody supposes that the computational model of rainstorms in London will leave us all wet. But they make the mistake of supposing that the computational model of consciousness is somehow conscious. It is the same mistake in both cases.{{sfn|Searle|2002}}|John R. Searle| Consciousness and Language, p. 16}}\n[[David Chalmers]] writes \"it is fairly clear that consciousness is at the root of the matter\" of the Chinese room.{{sfn|Chalmers|1996|p=322}}\n\n[[Colin McGinn]] argues that the Chinese room provides strong evidence that the [[hard problem of consciousness]] is fundamentally insoluble. The argument, to be clear, is not about whether a machine can be conscious, but about whether it (or anything else for that matter) can be shown to be conscious. It is plain that any other method of probing the occupant of a Chinese room has the same difficulties in principle as exchanging questions and answers in Chinese. It is simply not possible to divine whether a conscious agency or some clever simulation inhabits the room.{{sfn|McGinn|2000}}\n\nSearle argues that this is only true for an observer ''outside'' of the room. The whole point of the thought experiment is to put someone ''inside'' the room, where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.\n\n===Applied Ethics===\n\n[[File:USS Vincennes (CG-49) Aegis large screen displays.jpg|thumb|right|Sitting in the [[Operations room|Combat Information Center]] aboard [[USS Vincennes (CG-49)|a warship]] - proposed as a real-life analog to the Chinese Room]]\nPatrick Hew used the Chinese Room argument to deduce requirements from military [[command and control]] systems if they are to preserve a commander's [[moral agency]]. He drew an analogy between a commander in their [[Operations room|command center]] and the person in the Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of [[Nicomachean Ethics|Aristotle\u2019s notions of 'compulsory' and 'ignorance']]. Information could be 'down converted' from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the [[Iran Air Flight 655|USS ''Vincennes'' incident]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hew|first1=Patrick Chisan|title=Preserving a combat commander\u2019s moral agency: The Vincennes Incident as a Chinese Room|journal=Ethics and Information Technology|date=September 2016|volume=18|issue=3|pages=227\u2013235 |doi=10.1007/s10676-016-9408-y}}</ref>\n\n==Computer science==\nThe Chinese room argument is primarily an argument in the [[philosophy of mind]], and both major computer scientists and artificial intelligence researchers consider it irrelevant to their fields.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} However, several concepts developed by computer scientists are essential to understanding the argument, including [[physical symbol system|symbol processing]], [[Turing machine]]s, [[Turing completeness]], and the [[Turing test]].\n\n===Strong AI vs. AI research===\nSearle's arguments are not usually considered an issue for AI research. [[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] observe that most AI researchers \"don't care about the strong AI hypothesis\u2014as long as the program works, they don't care whether you call it a simulation of intelligence or real intelligence.\"{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} The primary mission of [[artificial intelligence]] research is only to create useful systems that ''act'' intelligently, and it does not matter if the intelligence is \"merely\" a simulation.\n\nSearle does not disagree that AI research can create machines that are capable of highly intelligent behavior. The Chinese room argument leaves open the possibility that a digital machine could be built that ''acts'' more intelligently than a person, but does not have a [[mind]] or [[intentionality]] in the same way that [[Human brain|brains]] do. The Chinese room argument is not a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', rather it is an example that requires explanation. \n\nSearle's \"strong AI\" should not be confused with \"[[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]\" as defined by [[Ray Kurzweil]] and other futurists,{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005|p=260}} who use the term to describe machine intelligence that rivals or exceeds human intelligence. Kurzweil is concerned primarily with the ''amount'' of intelligence displayed by the machine, whereas Searle's argument sets no limit on this. Searle argues that even a super-intelligent machine would not necessarily have a mind and consciousness.\n\n===Turing test===\n{{main article|Turing test}}\n[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The \"standard interpretation\" of the Turing Test, in which player C, the interrogator, is given the task of trying to determine which player \u2013 A or B \u2013 is a computer and which is a human. The interrogator is limited to using the responses to written questions to make the determination. Image adapted from Saygin, 2000.{{sfn|Saygin|2000}}]]\nThe Chinese room implements a version of the [[Turing test]].{{sfn|Turing|1950}} [[Alan Turing]] introduced the test in 1950 to help answer the question \"can machines think?\" In the standard version, a human judge engages in a natural language conversation with a human and a machine designed to generate performance indistinguishable from that of a human being. All participants are separated from one another. If the judge cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test.\n\nTuring then considered each possible objection to the proposal \"machines can think\", and found that there are simple, obvious answers if the question is de-mystified in this way. He did not, however, intend for the test to measure for the presence of \"consciousness\" or \"understanding\". He did not believe this was relevant to the issues that he was addressing. He wrote:\n{{quote|I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness. There is, for instance, something of a paradox connected with any attempt to localise it. But I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.{{sfn|Turing|1950}}}}\n\nTo Searle, as a philosopher investigating in the nature of [[philosophy of mind|mind]] and [[consciousness]], these are the relevant mysteries. The Chinese room is designed to show that the Turing test is insufficient to detect the presence of consciousness, even if the room can [[behaviourism|behave]] or [[functionalism (philosophy)|function]] as a conscious mind would.\n\n===Symbol processing===\n{{Main article|Physical symbol system}}\nThe Chinese room (and all modern computers) manipulate physical objects in order to carry out calculations and do simulations. AI researchers [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] called this kind of machine a [[physical symbol system]]. It is also equivalent to the [[formal system]]s used in the field of [[mathematical logic]].\n\nSearle emphasizes the fact that this kind of symbol manipulation is [[syntax|syntactic]] (borrowing a term from the study of [[grammar]]). The computer manipulates the symbols using a form of [[syntax|syntax rules]], without any knowledge of the symbol's [[semantics]] (that is, their [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]).\n\nNewell and Simon had conjectured that a physical symbol system (such as a digital computer) had all the necessary machinery for \"general intelligent action\", or, as it is known today, [[artificial general intelligence]]. They framed this as a philosophical position, the [[physical symbol system|physical symbol system hypothesis]]: \"A physical symbol system has the [[sufficient|necessary and sufficient means]] for general intelligent action.\"{{sfn|Newell|Simon|1976|p=116}}{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}} The Chinese room argument does not refute this, because it is framed in terms of \"intelligent action\", i.e. the external behavior of the machine, rather than the presence or absence of understanding, consciousness and mind.\n\n===Chinese room and Turing completeness===\n{{See also|Turing completeness|Church-Turing thesis}}\nThe Chinese room has a design analogous to that of a modern computer. It has a [[Von Neumann architecture]], which consists of a program (the book of instructions), some memory (the papers and file cabinets), a [[central processing unit|CPU]] which follows the instructions (the man), and a means to write symbols in memory (the pencil and eraser). A machine with this design is known in [[theoretical computer science]] as \"[[Turing complete]]\", because it has the necessary machinery to carry out any computation that a [[Turing machine]] can do, and therefore it is capable of doing a step-by-step simulation of any other digital machine, given enough memory and time. [[Alan Turing]] writes, \"all digital computers are in a sense equivalent.\"{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=442}} The widely accepted [[Church-Turing thesis]] holds that any function computable by an effective procedure is computable by a Turing machine.\n\nThe Turing completeness of the Chinese room implies that it can do whatever any other digital computer can do (albeit much, much more slowly). Thus, if the Chinese room does not or can not contain a Chinese-speaking mind, then no other digital computer can contain a mind. Some replies to Searle begin by arguing that the room, as described, cannot have a Chinese-speaking mind. Arguments of this form, according to [[Stevan Harnad]], are \"no refutation (but rather an affirmation)\"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}} of the Chinese room argument, because these arguments actually imply that ''no'' digital computers can have a mind.{{sfn|Harnad|2001}}\n\nThere are some critics, such as Hanoch Ben-Yami, who argue that the Chinese room cannot simulate all the abilities of a digital computer, such as being able to determine the current time.{{sfn|Ben-Yami|1993}}\n\n==Complete argument==\nSearle has produced a more formal version of the argument of which the Chinese Room forms a part. He presented the first version in 1984. The version given below is from 1990.<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}; {{Harvnb|Searle|1990}}.</ref>{{efn|The wording of each axiom and conclusion are from Searle's presentation in ''[[Scientific American]]''.{{sfn|Searle|1990}}{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=5}} (A1-3) and (C1) are described as 1,2,3 and 4 in David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=5}}}} The only part of the argument which should be controversial is A3 and it is this point which the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove.{{efn|Paul and Patricia Churchland write that the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to \"shore up axiom 3\".{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990|p=34}}}}\n\nHe begins with three axioms:\n:(A1) \"Programs are formal ([[syntax|syntactic]]).\"\n::A program uses [[syntax]] to manipulate symbols and pays no attention to the [[semantics]] of the symbols. It knows where to put the symbols and how to move them around, but it doesn't know what they stand for or what they mean. For the program, the symbols are just physical objects like any others.\n\n:(A2) \"Minds have mental contents ([[semantics]]).\"\n::Unlike the symbols used by a program, our thoughts have meaning: they represent things and we know what it is they represent.\n\n:(A3) \"Syntax by itself is neither constitutive of nor sufficient for semantics.\"\n::This is what the Chinese room thought experiment is intended to prove: the Chinese room has syntax (because there is a man in there moving symbols around). The Chinese room has no semantics (because, according to Searle, there is no one or nothing in the room that understands what the symbols mean). Therefore, having syntax is not enough to generate semantics.\n\nSearle posits that these lead directly to this conclusion:\n\n:(C1) Programs are neither constitutive of nor sufficient for minds.\n::This should follow without controversy from the first three: Programs don't have semantics. Programs have only syntax, and syntax is insufficient for semantics. Every mind has semantics. Therefore no programs are minds.\n\nThis much of the argument is intended to show that [[artificial intelligence]] can never produce a machine with a mind by writing programs that manipulate symbols. The remainder of the argument addresses a different issue. Is the human brain running a program? In other words, is the [[computational theory of mind]] correct?{{efn|name=Computationalism}} He begins with an axiom that is intended to express the basic modern scientific consensus about brains and minds:\n\n:(A4) Brains cause minds.\n\nSearle claims that we can derive \"immediately\" and \"trivially\"{{sfn|Searle|1990}} that:\n\n:(C2) Any other system capable of causing minds would have to have causal powers (at least) equivalent to those of brains.\n::Brains must have something that causes a mind to exist. Science has yet to determine exactly what it is, but it must exist, because minds exist. Searle calls it \"causal powers\". \"Causal powers\" is whatever the brain uses to create a mind. If anything else can cause a mind to exist, it must have \"equivalent causal powers\". \"Equivalent causal powers\" is whatever ''else'' that could be used to make a mind.\n\nAnd from this he derives the further conclusions:\n\n:(C3) Any artifact that produced mental phenomena, any artificial brain, would have to be able to duplicate the specific causal powers of brains, and it could not do that just by running a formal program.\n::This [[Logical consequence|follows from]] C1 and C2: Since no program can produce a mind, and \"equivalent causal powers\" produce minds, it follows that programs do not have \"equivalent causal powers.\"\n\n:(C4) The way that human brains actually produce mental phenomena cannot be solely by virtue of running a computer program.\n::Since programs do not have \"equivalent causal powers\", \"equivalent causal powers\" produce minds, and brains produce minds, it follows that brains do not use programs to produce minds.\n\n==Replies==\nReplies to Searle's argument may be classified according to what they claim to show:{{efn|David Cole combines the second and third categories, as well as the fourth and fifth.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=5\u20136}}}}\n* Those which identify ''who'' speaks Chinese\n* Those which demonstrate how meaningless symbols can become meaningful\n* Those which suggest that the Chinese room should be redesigned in some way\n* Those which contend that Searle's argument is misleading\n* Those which argue that the argument makes false assumptions about subjective conscious experience and therefore proves nothing\n\nSome of the arguments (robot and brain simulation, for example) fall into multiple categories.\n\n===Systems and virtual mind replies: finding the mind===\nThese replies attempt to answer the question: since the man in the room doesn't speak Chinese, ''where'' is the \"mind\" that does? These replies address the key [[ontological]] issues of [[mind/body problem|mind vs. body]] and simulation vs. reality. All of the replies that identify the mind in the room are versions of \"the system reply\".\n\n;System reply:The basic version argues that it is the \"whole system\" that understands Chinese.<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=5\u20136}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=6\u20137}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=2\u20133}}; {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=439}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}.</ref>{{efn|This position is held by  [[Ned Block]], [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=6}}}}  While the man understands only English, when he is combined with the program, scratch paper, pencils and file cabinets, they form a system that can understand Chinese. \"Here, understanding is not being ascribed to the mere individual; rather it is being ascribed to this whole system of which he is a part\" Searle explains.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The fact that man does not understand Chinese is irrelevant, because it is only the system as a whole that matters.\n\nSearle notes that (in this simple version of the reply) the \"system\" is nothing more than a collection of ordinary physical objects; it grants the power of understanding and consciousness to \"the conjunction of that person and bits of paper\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} without making any effort to explain how this pile of objects has become a conscious, thinking being. Searle argues that no reasonable person should be satisfied with the reply, unless they are \"under the grip of an ideology;\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} In order for this reply to be remotely plausible, one must take it for granted that consciousness can be the product of an information processing \"system\", and does not require anything resembling the actual biology of the brain.\n\nSearle then responds by simplifying this list of physical objects: he asks what happens if the man memorizes the rules and keeps track of everything in his head? Then the whole system consists of just one object: the man himself. Searle argues that if the man doesn't understand Chinese then the system doesn't understand Chinese either because now \"the system\" and \"the man\" both describe exactly the same object.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} \n\nCritics of Searle's response argue that the program has allowed the man to have two minds in one head.{{who|date=March 2011}} If we assume a \"mind\" is a form of information processing, then the [[theory of computation]] can account for two computations occurring at once, namely (1) the computation for [[Universal Turing machine|universal programmability]] (which is the function instantiated by the person and note-taking materials ''independently'' from any particular program contents) and (2) the computation of the Turing machine that is described by the program (which is instantiated by everything ''including'' the specific program).{{sfn|Yee|1993|p=44|footnote=2}} The theory of computation thus formally explains the open possibility that the second computation in the Chinese Room could entail a human-equivalent semantic understanding of the Chinese inputs. The focus belongs on the program's Turing machine rather than on the person's.{{sfn|Yee|1993|pp=42\u201347}} However, from Searle's perspective, this argument is circular. The question at issue is whether consciousness is a form of information processing, and this reply requires that we make that assumption.\n\nMore sophisticated versions of the systems reply try to identify more precisely what \"the system\" is and they differ in exactly how they describe it. According to these replies,{{who|date=March 2011}} the \"mind that speaks Chinese\" could be such things as: the \"software\", a \"program\", a \"running program\", a simulation of the \"neural correlates of consciousness\", the \"functional system\", a \"simulated mind\", an \"[[strong emergence|emergent]] property\", or \"a [[virtual artifact|virtual]] mind\" ([[Marvin Minsky]]'s version of the systems reply, described below).\n\n;Virtual mind reply:The term \"[[virtual artifact|virtual]]\" is used in computer science to describe an object that appears to exist \"in\" a computer (or computer network) only because software makes it appear to exist. The objects \"inside\" computers (including files, folders, and so on) are all \"virtual\", except for the computer's electronic components. Similarly, [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] argues, a computer may contain a \"mind\" that is virtual in the same sense as [[virtual machine]]s, [[virtual community|virtual communities]] and [[virtual reality]].{{efn|The virtual mind reply is held by [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=7\u20139}} The reply was introduced by [[Marvin Minsky]].{{sfn|Minsky|1980|p=440}}{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=7}}}}\n\n:To clarify the distinction between the simple systems reply given above and virtual mind reply, David Cole notes that two simulations could be running on one system at the same time: one speaking Chinese and one speaking Korean. While there is only one system, there can be multiple \"virtual minds,\" thus the \"system\" cannot be the \"mind\".{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=8}}\n\nSearle responds that such a mind is, at best, a simulation, and writes: \"No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=12}} Nicholas Fearn responds that, for some things, simulation is as good as the real thing. \"When we call up the pocket calculator function on a desktop computer, the image of a pocket calculator appears on the screen. We don't complain that 'it isn't ''really'' a calculator', because the physical attributes of the device do not matter.\"{{sfn|Fearn|2007|p=47}} The question is, is the human mind like the pocket calculator, essentially composed of information? Or is the mind like the rainstorm, something other than a computer, and not realizable in full by a computer simulation? (The issue of simulation is also discussed in the article [[synthetic intelligence]].)\n\nThese replies provide an explanation of exactly who it is that understands Chinese. If there is something ''besides'' the man in the room that can understand Chinese, Searle can't argue that (1) the man doesn't understand Chinese, therefore (2) nothing in the room understands Chinese. This, according to those who make this reply, shows that Searle's argument fails to prove that \"strong AI\" is false.{{efn|David Cole writes \"From the intuition that in the CR thought experiment he would not understand Chinese by running a program, Searle infers that there is no understanding created by running a program. Clearly, whether that inference is valid or not turns on a metaphysical question about the identity of persons and minds. If the person understanding is not identical with the room operator, then the inference is unsound.\"{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=21}}}}\n\nHowever, the thought experiment is not intended to be a reduction ad absurdum, but rather an example that requires explanation. Searle is not asserting that the situation is impossible, but rather that it is difficult or impossible to explain how this system can have subjection conscious experience.{{sfn|Searle|2004|p=63|quote=\"the Chinese room argument ... assumes complete success on the part of artificial intelligence in simulating human cognition.\"}} The system reply succeeds in showing that it is ''not impossible'' but fails to show how the system would have consciousness; the replies, by themselves, provide no evidence that the system (or the virtual mind) understands Chinese, other than the [[hypothetical]] premise that it passes the [[Turing Test]]. As Searle writes \"the systems reply simply begs the question by insisting that the system must understand Chinese.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}}\n\n===Robot and semantics replies: finding the meaning===\nAs far as the person in the room is concerned, the symbols are just meaningless \"squiggles.\" But if the Chinese room really \"understands\" what it is saying, then the symbols must get their meaning from somewhere. These arguments attempt to connect the symbols to the things they symbolize. These replies address Searle's concerns about [[intentionality]], [[symbol grounding]] and [[syntax]] vs. [[semantic]]s.\n\n;Robot reply:Suppose that instead of a room, the program was placed into a robot that could wander around and interact with its environment. This would allow a \"[[causality|causal]] connection\" between the symbols and things they represent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=9\u201311}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=3}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=44}}.</ref>{{efn|This position is held by [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Stevan Harnad]], [[Hans Moravec]], and [[Georges Rey]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=9}}}} [[Hans Moravec]] comments: \"If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world.\"<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}</ref>{{efn| David Cole calls this the \"externalist\" account of meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}}}\n\n:Searle's reply is to suppose that, unbeknownst to the individual in the Chinese room, some of the inputs came directly from a camera mounted on a robot, and some of the outputs were used to manipulate the arms and legs of the robot. Nevertheless, the person in the room is still just following the rules, and ''does not know what the symbols mean.'' Searle writes \"he doesn't ''see'' what comes into the robot's eyes.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} (See [[Mary's room]] for a similar thought experiment.)\n\n;Derived meaning: Some respond that the room, as Searle describes it, ''is'' connected to the world: through the Chinese speakers that it is \"talking\" to and through the programmers who designed the [[knowledge base]] in his file cabinet. The symbols Searle manipulates ''are already meaningful'', they're just not meaningful to ''him''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=19}}.</ref>{{efn|The derived meaning reply is associated with [[Daniel Dennett]] and others.}}\n\n:Searle says that the symbols only have a \"derived\" meaning, like the meaning of words in books. The meaning of the symbols depends on the conscious understanding of the Chinese speakers and the programmers outside the room. The room, like a book, has no understanding of its own.{{efn|Searle distinguishes between \"intrinsic\" intentionality and \"derived\" intentionality. \"Intrinsic\" intentionality is the kind that involves \"conscious understanding\" like you would have in a human mind. [[Daniel Dennett]] doesn't agree that there is a distinction. David Cole writes \"derived intentionality is all there is, according to Dennett.\"{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=19}}}}\n\n;Commonsense knowledge / contextualist reply:Some have argued that the meanings of the symbols would come from a vast \"background\" of [[commonsense knowledge]] encoded in the program and the filing cabinets. This would provide a \"[[contextualism|context]]\" that would give the symbols their meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}}{{efn|David Cole describes this as the \"internalist\" approach to meaning.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=18}} Proponents of this position include [[Roger Schank]], [[Doug Lenat]], [[Marvin Minsky]] and (with reservations) [[Daniel Dennett]], who writes \"The fact is that any program [that passed a Turing test] would have to be an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge.\" {{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}\n\n:Searle agrees that this background exists, but he does not agree that it can be built into programs. [[Hubert Dreyfus]] has also criticized the idea that the \"background\" can be represented symbolically.{{sfn|Dreyfus|1979|loc=\"The [[epistemological]] assumption\"}}\n\nTo each of these suggestions, Searle's response is the same: no matter how much knowledge is written into the program and no matter how the program is connected to the world, he is still in the room manipulating symbols according to rules. His actions are [[syntax|syntactic]] and this can never explain to him what the symbols stand for. Searle writes \"syntax is insufficient for semantics.\"{{sfn|Searle|1984}}{{efn|Searle also writes \"Formal symbols by themselves can never be enough for mental contents, because the symbols, by definition, have no meaning (or [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], or semantics) except insofar as someone outside the system gives it to them.\"{{sfn|Motzkin|Searle|1989|p=45}}}}\n\nHowever, for those who accept that Searle's actions simulate a mind, separate from his own, the important question is not what the symbols mean ''to Searle'', what is important is what they mean ''to the virtual mind.'' While Searle is trapped in the room, the virtual mind is not: it is connected to the outside world through the Chinese speakers it speaks to, through the programmers who gave it world knowledge, and through the cameras and other sensors that [[roboticist]]s can supply.\n\n===Brain simulation and connectionist replies: redesigning the room===\nThese arguments are all versions of the systems reply that identify a particular ''kind'' of system as being important; they identify some special technology that would create conscious understanding in a machine. (Note that the \"robot\" and \"commonsense knowledge\" replies above also specify a certain kind of system as being important.)\n\n;Brain simulator reply:Suppose that the program simulated in fine detail the action of every neuron in the brain of a Chinese speaker.<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=7\u20138}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=12\u201313}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=3\u20134}}; {{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}.</ref>{{efn|The brain simulation replay has been made by [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]].{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=12}}}} This strengthens the intuition that there would be no significant difference between the operation of the program and the operation of a live human brain.\n\n:Searle replies that such a simulation does not reproduce the important features of the brain\u2014its causal and intentional states. [[John Searle|Searle]] is adamant that \"human mental phenomena [are] dependent on actual physical\u2013chemical properties of actual human brains.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=13}} Moreover, he argues:\n\n<blockquote>[I]magine that instead of a monolingual man in a room shuffling symbols we have the man operate an elaborate set of water pipes with valves connecting them. When the man receives the Chinese symbols, he looks up in the program, written in English, which valves he has to turn on and off. Each water connection corresponds to a synapse in the Chinese brain, and the whole system is rigged up so that after doing all the right firings, that is after turning on all the right faucets, the Chinese answers pop out at the output end of the series of pipes.\n\nNow where is the understanding in this system? It takes Chinese as input, it simulates the formal structure of the synapses of the Chinese brain, and it gives Chinese as output. But the man certainly doesn't understand Chinese, and neither do the water pipes, and if we are tempted to adopt what I think is the absurd view that somehow the conjunction of man and water pipes understands, remember that in principle the man can internalize the formal structure of the water pipes and do all the \"neuron firings\" in his imagination.{{sfn|Searle|1980}}</blockquote>\n\n:Two variations on the brain simulator reply are:\n:;[[China brain]]:What if we ask each citizen of China to simulate one neuron, using the telephone system to simulate the connections between [[axon]]s and [[dendrite]]s? In this version, it seems obvious that no individual would have any understanding of what the brain might be saying.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=4}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.</ref>{{efn|Early versions of this argument were put forward in 1974 by [[Lawrence Davis]] and in 1978 by [[Ned Block]]. Block's version used walkie talkies and was called the \"Chinese Gym\". Paul and Patricia Churchland described this scenario as well.{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}}} It is also obvious that this system would be functionally equivalent to a brain, so if consciousness is a function, this system would be conscious.\n\n:;Brain replacement scenario:In this, we are asked to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue that there would be no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins.<ref>{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=956\u20138}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=20}}; {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}; {{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}.</ref>{{efn|An early version of the brain replacement scenario was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-70s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] in 1980.

You find, for example, that when doctors test your vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely outside of your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] [Y]our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1992}} quoted in {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=957}}.</ref> (See [[Ship of Theseus]] for a similar thought experiment.)\n \n;Connectionist replies:Closely related to the brain simulator reply, this claims that a massively parallel connectionist architecture would be capable of understanding.{{efn|The connectionist reply is made by [[Andy Clark]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]],{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=12 & 17}} as well as [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]].{{sfn|Hauser|2006|p=7}}}}\n\n;Combination reply:This response combines the robot reply with the brain simulation reply, arguing that a brain simulation connected to the world through a robot body could have a mind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|pp=8\u20139}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|p=11}}.</ref>\n\n;Many mansions/Wait till next year reply:Better technology in the future will allow computers to understand.{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}}{{efn|{{harvtxt|Searle|2009}} uses the name \"Wait 'Til Next Year Reply\".}} Searle agrees that this is possible, but considers this point irrelevant. His argument is that a machine using a program to manipulate formally defined elements can not produce understanding. Searle's argument, if correct, rules out only this particular design. Searle agrees that there may be other designs that would cause a machine to have conscious understanding.\n\nThese arguments (and the robot or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology that would help create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) it would not have conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is easier to see that the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.\n\nIn the first case, where features like a robot body or a connectionist architecture are required, Searle claims that strong AI (as he understands it) has been abandoned.{{efn|Searle writes that the robot reply \"tacitly concedes that cognition is not solely a matter of formal symbol manipulation.\" {{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} Stevan Harnad makes the same point, writing: \"Now just as it is no refutation (but rather an affirmation) of the CRA to deny that [the Turing test] is a strong enough test, or to deny that a computer could ever pass it, it is merely special pleading to try to save computationalism by stipulating ad hoc (in the face of the CRA) that implementational details do matter after all, and that the computer's is the 'right' kind of implementation, whereas Searle's is the 'wrong' kind.\"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=14}}}} The Chinese room has all the elements of a Turing complete machine, and thus is capable of simulating any digital computation whatsoever. If Searle's room can't pass the Turing test then there is no other digital technology that could pass the Turing test. If Searle's room ''could'' pass the Turing test, but still does not have a mind, then the Turing test is not sufficient to determine if the room has a \"mind\". Either way, it denies one or the other of the positions Searle thinks of as \"strong AI\", proving his argument.\n\nThe brain arguments in particular deny strong AI if they assume that there is no simpler way to describe the mind than to create a program that is just as mysterious as the brain was. He writes \"I thought the whole idea of strong AI was that we don't need to know how the brain works to know how the mind works.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=8}} If computation does not provide an ''explanation'' of the human mind, then strong AI has failed, according to Searle.\n\nOther critics hold that the room as Searle described it does, in fact, have a mind, however they argue that it is difficult to see\u2014Searle's description is correct, but ''misleading.'' By redesigning the room more realistically they hope to make this more obvious. In this case, these arguments are being used as appeals to intuition (see next section).\n\nIn fact, the room can just as easily be redesigned to ''weaken'' our intuitions. [[Ned Block]]'s [[Blockhead argument]]{{sfn|Block|1981}} suggests that the program could, in theory, be rewritten into a simple [[lookup table]] of [[Production system (computer science)|rules]] of the form \"if the user writes ''S'', reply with ''P'' and goto X\". At least in principle, any program can be rewritten (or \"[[refactored]]\") into this form, even a brain simulation.{{efn|That is, any program running on a machine with a finite amount memory.}} In the blockhead scenario, the entire mental state is hidden in the letter X, which represents a [[memory address]]\u2014a number associated with the next rule. It is hard to visualize that an instant of one's conscious experience can be captured in a single large number, yet this is exactly what \"strong AI\" claims. On the other hand, such a lookup table would be ridiculously large (to the point of being physically impossible), and the states could therefore be ''extremely'' specific.\n\nSearle argues that however the program is written or however the machine is connected to the world, the mind is being ''simulated'' by a simple step by step digital machine (or machines). These machines are always just like the man in the room: they understand nothing and don't speak Chinese. They are merely manipulating symbols without knowing what they mean. Searle writes: \"I can have any formal program you like, but I still understand nothing.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=3}}\n\n===Speed and complexity: appeals to intuition===\nThe following arguments (and the intuitive interpretations of the arguments above) do not directly explain how a Chinese speaking mind could exist in Searle's room, or how the symbols he manipulates could become meaningful. However, by raising doubts about Searle's intuitions they support other positions, such as the system and robot replies. These arguments, if accepted, prevent Searle from claiming that his conclusion is obvious by undermining the intuitions that his certainty requires.\n\nSeveral critics believe that Searle's argument relies entirely on intuitions. [[Ned Block]] writes \"Searle's argument depends for its force on intuitions that certain entities do not think.\"<ref>Quoted in {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}.</ref> [[Daniel Dennett]] describes the Chinese room argument as a misleading \"[[intuition pump]]\"{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437\u2013440}} and writes \"Searle's thought experiment depends, illicitly, on your imagining too simple a case, an irrelevant case, and drawing the 'obvious' conclusion from it.\"{{sfn|Dennett|1991|pp=437\u2013440}}\n\nSome of the arguments above also function as appeals to intuition, especially those that are intended to make it seem more plausible that the Chinese room contains a mind, which can include the robot, commonsense knowledge, brain simulation and connectionist replies. Several of the replies above also address the specific issue of complexity. The connectionist reply emphasizes that a working artificial intelligence system would have to be as complex and as interconnected as the human brain. The commonsense knowledge reply emphasizes that any program that passed a Turing test would have to be \"an extraordinarily supple, sophisticated, and multilayered system, brimming with 'world knowledge' and meta-knowledge and meta-meta-knowledge\", as [[Daniel Dennett]] explains.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}\n\n;Speed and complexity replies:The speed at which human brains process information is (by some estimates) 100 billion operations per second.{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=269}} Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require \"filing cabinets\" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|pp=14\u201315}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269\u2013270}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=95}}.</ref>{{efn|Speed and complexity replies are made by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Paul Churchland]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} Daniel Dennett points out the complexity of world knowledge.{{sfn|Dennett|1991|p=438}}}}\n\nAn especially vivid version of the speed and complexity reply is from [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]. They propose this analogous thought experiment:\n\n;Churchland's luminous room:\"Consider a dark room containing a man holding a bar magnet or charged object. If the man pumps the magnet up and down, then, according to [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of artificial luminance (AL), it will initiate a spreading circle of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] waves and will thus be luminous. But as all of us who have toyed with magnets or charged balls well know, their forces (or any other forces for that matter), even when set in motion produce no luminance at all. It is inconceivable that you might constitute real luminance just by moving forces around!\"{{sfn|Churchland|Churchland|1990}} The problem is that he would have to wave the magnet up and down something like 450 trillion times per second in order to see anything.<ref>{{Harvnb|Churchland|Churchland|1990}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=12}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=270}}; {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|pp=45\u201346}}; {{Harvnb|Pinker|1997|p=94}}.</ref>\n\n[[Stevan Harnad]] is critical of speed and complexity replies when they stray beyond addressing our intuitions. He writes \"Some have made a cult of speed and timing, holding that, when accelerated to the right speed, the computational may make a [[phase transition]] into the mental. It should be clear that is not a counterargument but merely an ''[[ad hoc]]'' speculation (as is the view that it is all just a matter of ratcheting up to the right degree of 'complexity.')\"{{sfn|Harnad|2001|p=7}}{{efn|Critics of the \"phase transition\" form of this argument include Stevan Harnad, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[Daniel Dennett]] and David Cole.{{sfn|Cole|2004|p=14}} This \"phase transition\" idea is a version of [[strong emergentism]] (what [[Daniel Dennett]] derides as \"Woo woo West Coast emergence\"{{sfn|Crevier|1993|p=275}}). Harnad accuses [[Paul Churchland|Churchland]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] of espousing strong emergentism. Ray Kurzweil also holds a form of strong emergentism.{{sfn|Kurzweil|2005}}}}\n\nSearle argues that his critics are also relying on intuitions, however his opponents' intuitions have no empirical basis. He writes that, in order to consider the \"system reply\" as remotely plausible, a person must be \"under the grip of an ideology\".{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=6}} The system reply only makes sense (to Searle) if one assumes that any \"system\" can have consciousness, just by virtue of being a system with the right behavior and functional parts. This assumption, he argues, is not tenable given our experience of consciousness.\n\n===Other minds and zombies: meaninglessness===<!-- Linked to in a footnote above -->\n\nSeveral replies argue that Searle's argument is irrelevant because his assumptions about the mind and consciousness are faulty. Searle believes that  human beings directly experience their consciousness, intentionality and the nature of the mind every day, and that this experience of consciousness is not open to question.  He writes that we must \"presuppose the reality and knowability of the mental.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=10}} These replies question whether Searle is justified in using his own experience of consciousness to determine that it is more than mechanical symbol processing. In particular, the other minds reply argues that we cannot use our experience of consciousness to answer questions about other minds (even the mind of a computer), and the epiphenomena reply argues that Searle's consciousness does not \"exist\" in the sense that Searle thinks it does.\n\n;Other minds reply:This reply points out that Searle's argument is a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. There is no way we can determine if other people's subjective experience is the same as our own. We can only study their behavior (i.e., by giving them our own [[Turing test]]). Critics of Searle argue that he is holding the Chinese room to a higher standard than we would hold an ordinary person.<ref>{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=9}}; {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=13}}; {{Harvnb|Hauser|2006|pp=4\u20135}}; {{Harvnb|Nilsson|1984}}.</ref>{{efn|The \"other minds\" reply has been offered by [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Hans Moravec]], among others.{{sfn|Cole|2004|pp=12\u201313}}}}\n\n[[Nils Nilsson (researcher)|Nils Nilsson]] writes \"If a program behaves ''as if''  it were multiplying, most of us would say that it is, in fact, multiplying.  For all I know, Searle may only be behaving ''as if''  he were thinking deeply about these matters.  But, even though I disagree with him, his simulation is pretty good, so I'm willing to credit him with real thought.\"{{sfn|Nilsson|1984}}\n\n[[Alan Turing]] anticipated Searle's line of argument (which he called \"The Argument from Consciousness\") in 1950 and makes the other minds reply.{{sfn|Turing|1950|pp=11\u201312}} He noted that people never consider the problem of other minds when dealing with each other. He writes that \"instead of arguing continually over this point it is usual to have the polite convention that everyone thinks.\"{{sfn|Turing|1950|p=11}} The [[Turing test]] simply extends this \"polite convention\" to machines. He doesn't intend to solve the problem of other minds (for machines or people) and he doesn't think we need to.{{efn|One of Turing's motivations for devising the [[Turing test]] is to avoid precisely the kind of philosophical problems that Searle is interested in. He writes \"I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery ... [but] I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question with which we are concerned in this paper.\" {{sfn|Turing|1950|p=12}} Although Turing is discussing consciousness (not the mind or understanding or intentionality), Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig argue that Turing's comments apply the Chinese room.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=952\u2013953}}}}\n\n; Epiphenomenon / zombie reply: Several philosophers argue that consciousness, as Searle describes it, does not exist. This position is sometimes referred to as [[eliminative materialism]]: the view that consciousness is a property that can be reduced to a strictly mechanical description, and that our experience of consciousness is, as Daniel Dennett describes it, a \"[[user illusion]]\".{{sfn|Dennett|1991|loc={{page needed|date=February 2011}}}}\n\n:[[Stuart J. Russell|Stuart Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig]] argue that, if we accept Searle's description of intentionality, consciousness and the mind, we are forced to accept that consciousness is  [[epiphenomenal]]: that it \"casts no shadow\", that it is undetectable in the outside world. They argue that Searle must be mistaken about the \"knowability of the mental\", and in his belief that there are \"causal properties\" in our neurons that give rise to the mind. They point out that, by Searle's own description, these causal properties can't be detected by anyone outside the mind, otherwise the Chinese Room couldn't pass the [[Turing test]]\u2014the people outside would be able to tell there wasn't a Chinese speaker in the room by detecting their causal properties. Since they can't detect causal properties, they can't detect the existence of the mental. In short, Searle's \"causal properties\" and consciousness itself is undetectable, and anything that cannot be detected either does not exist or does not matter.{{sfn|Russell|Norvig|2003}}\n\n[[Daniel Dennett]] provides this extension to the \"epiphenomena\" argument.\n;Dennett's reply from natural selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, a human being is born that does not have Searle's \"causal properties\" but nevertheless acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a \"[[philosophical zombie|zombie]]\" in thought experiments in the [[philosophy of mind]]). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as we see them today) are actually \"zombies\", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|p=22}}; {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=271}}; {{Harvnb|Harnad|2005|p=4}}.</ref>\n\nSearle disagrees with this analysis and argues that \"the study of the mind starts with such facts as that humans have beliefs, while thermostats, telephones, and adding machines don't ... what we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers.\"{{sfn|Searle|1980|p=7}} He takes it as obvious that we can detect the presence of consciousness and dismisses these replies as being off the point.\n\n;[[Newton's flaming laser sword]] reply: [[Mike Alder]] argues that the entire argument is frivolous, because it is non-[[positivist]]: not only is the distinction between ''simulating'' a mind and ''having'' a mind ill-defined, but it is also irrelevant because no experiments were, or even can be, proposed to distinguish between the two.{{sfn|Alder|2004}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nThe Chinese room argument is a central concept in [[Peter Watts (author)|Peter Watts]]'s novels ''[[Blindsight (Watts novel)|Blindsight]]'' and (to a lesser extent) ''Echopraxia''.<ref>Patrick Whitmarsh.

Thus the length of the circumference ''C'' is related to the radius ''r'' and diameter ''d'' by:\n:<math>C = 2\\pi r = \\pi d.\\,</math>\n\n===Area enclosed===\n[[Image:Circle Area.svg|thumb|Area enclosed by a circle = {{pi}} \u00d7 area of the shaded square]]\n{{Main article|Area of a circle}}\nAs proved by [[Archimedes]], in his [[Measurement of a Circle]], the [[Area of a disk|area enclosed by a circle]] is equal to that of a triangle whose base has the length of the circle's circumference and whose height equals the circle's radius,<ref>{{citation|first=Victor J.|last=Katz|title=A History of Mathematics / An Introduction|edition=2nd|year=1998|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|isbn=978-0-321-01618-8|page=108}}</ref> which comes to {{pi}} multiplied by the radius squared:\n:<math>\\mathrm{Area} = \\pi r^2.\\,</math>\n\nEquivalently, denoting diameter by ''d'',\n:<math>\\mathrm{Area} = \\frac{\\pi d^2}{4} \\approx 0{.}7854d^2,</math>\n\nthat is, approximately 79% of the [[Circumscribe|circumscribing]] square (whose side is of length ''d'').\n\nThe circle is the plane curve enclosing the maximum area for a given arc length.

If the circle is centred at the origin (0, 0), then the equation simplifies to\n:<math>x^2 + y^2 = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\n'''Parametric form '''<br>\nThe equation can be written in [[parametric equation|parametric form]] using the [[trigonometric function]]s sine and cosine as\n:<math>x = a+r\\,\\cos t,\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b+r\\,\\sin t\\,</math>\nwhere ''t'' is a [[parametric variable]] in the range 0 to 2{{pi}}, interpreted geometrically as the [[angle]] that the ray from (''a'',&nbsp;''b'') to (''x'',&nbsp;''y'') makes with the positive ''x''-axis.\n\nAn alternative parametrisation of the circle is:\n:<math>x = a + r \\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}.\\,</math>\n:<math>y = b + r \\frac{2t}{1+t^2}\\,</math>\n\nIn this parameterisation, the ratio of ''t'' to ''r'' can be interpreted geometrically as the [[stereographic projection]] of the line passing through the centre parallel to the ''x''-axis (see [[Tangent half-angle substitution]]). However, this parameterisation works only if ''t'' is made to range not only through all reals but also to a point at infinity; otherwise, the bottom-most point of the circle would be omitted.\n\n'''3-point-form '''<br>\nThe equation of the circle determined by three points <math>(x_1,y_1), (x_2,y_2),(x_3,y_3)</math> not on a line is obtained by a conversion of the [[Ellipse#Circles|''3-point-form of a circle's equation'']]\n::<math>\\frac{({\\color{green}x}-x_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)+({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{red}y}-y_2)}\n             {({\\color{red}y}-y_1)({\\color{green}x}-x_2)-({\\color{red}y}-y_2)({\\color{green}x}-x_1)}=\n        \\frac{(x_3-x_1)(x_3-x_2)+(y_3-y_1)(y_3-y_2)}\n             {(y_3-y_1)(x_3-x_2)-(y_3-y_2)(x_3-x_1)}.</math>\n\n'''Homogeneous form'''<br>\nIn [[homogeneous coordinates]], each [[conic section]] with the equation of a circle has the form\n:<math>x^2+y^2-2axz-2byz+cz^2 = 0.\\,</math>\n\nIt can be proven that a conic section is a circle exactly when it contains (when extended to the [[complex projective plane]]) the points ''I''(1: ''i'': 0) and ''J''(1:&nbsp;\u2212''i'':&nbsp;0). These points are called the [[circular points at infinity]].\n\n====Polar coordinates====\nIn [[polar coordinates]], the equation of a circle is:\n:<math>r^2 - 2 r r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) + r_0^2 = a^2\\,</math>\n\nwhere ''a'' is the radius of the circle, <math>(r, \\theta)</math> is the polar coordinate of a generic point on the circle, and <math>(r_0, \\phi)</math> is the polar coordinate of the centre of the circle (i.e., ''r''<sub>0</sub> is the distance from the origin to the centre of the circle, and ''\u03c6'' is the anticlockwise angle from the positive ''x''-axis to the line connecting the origin to the centre of the circle). For a circle centred on the origin, i.e. ''r''<sub>0</sub> = 0, this reduces to simply {{nowrap|''r'' {{=}} ''a''}}. When {{nowrap|''r''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} ''a''}}, or when the origin lies on the circle, the equation becomes\n:<math>r = 2 a\\cos(\\theta - \\phi).\\,</math>\n\nIn the general case, the equation can be solved for ''r'', giving\n:<math>r = r_0 \\cos(\\theta - \\phi) \\pm \\sqrt{a^2 - r_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta - \\phi)},</math>\nNote that without the \u00b1 sign, the equation would in some cases describe only half a circle.\n\n====Complex plane====\nIn the [[complex plane]], a circle with a centre at ''c'' and radius ''r'' has the equation:\n\n:<math>|z-c| = r\\,</math>.\n\nIn [[Parametric equation|parametric form]], this can be written:\n\n:<math>z = re^{it}+c</math>.\n\nThe slightly generalised equation\n:<math>pz\\overline{z} + gz + \\overline{gz} = q</math>\n\nfor real ''p'', ''q'' and complex ''g'' is sometimes called a [[generalised circle]]. This becomes the above equation for a circle with <math>p = 1,\\ g=-\\overline{c},\\ q=r^2-|c|^2</math>, since <math>|z-c|^2 = z\\overline{z}-\\overline{c}z-c\\overline{z}+c\\overline{c}</math>. Not all generalised circles are actually circles: a generalised circle is either a (true) circle or a [[line (geometry)|line]].\n\n===Tangent lines===\n{{Main article|Tangent lines to circles}}\nThe [[tangent line]] through a point ''P'' on the circle is perpendicular to the diameter passing through ''P''. If {{nowrap|P {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and the circle has centre (''a'', ''b'') and radius ''r'', then the tangent line is perpendicular to the line from (''a'', ''b'') to (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>), so it has the form {{nowrap|(''x''<sub>1</sub> \u2212 ''a'')''x'' + (''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2013 ''b'')''y'' {{=}} ''c''}}. Evaluating at (''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>) determines the value of ''c'' and the result is that the equation of the tangent is\n:<math>(x_1-a)x+(y_1-b)y = (x_1-a)x_1+(y_1-b)y_1\\,</math>\nor\n:<math>(x_1-a)(x-a)+(y_1-b)(y-b) = r^2.\\!\\ </math>\n\nIf {{nowrap|''y''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 ''b''}} then the slope of this line is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1-a}{y_1-b}.</math>\n\nThis can also be found using [[implicit differentiation]].\n\nWhen the centre of the circle is at the origin then the equation of the tangent line becomes\n:<math>x_1x+y_1y = r^2,\\!\\ </math>\nand its slope is\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx} = -\\frac{x_1}{y_1}.</math>\n\n==Properties==\n*The circle is the shape with the largest area for a given length of perimeter. (See [[Isoperimetric inequality]].)\n*The circle is a highly symmetric shape: every line through the centre forms a line of [[reflection symmetry]] and it has [[rotational symmetry]] around the centre for every angle. Its [[symmetry group]] is the [[orthogonal group]] O(2,''R''). The group of rotations alone is the [[circle group]] '''T'''.\n*All circles are [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]].\n**A circle's circumference and radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n**The [[area (geometry)|area]] enclosed and the square of its radius are [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]].\n**The [[mathematical constant|constants]] of proportionality are 2{{pi}} and {{pi}}, respectively.\n*The circle that is centred at the origin with radius 1 is called the [[unit circle]].\n**Thought of as a [[great circle]] of the [[unit sphere]], it becomes the [[Riemannian circle]].\n*Through any three points, not all on the same line, there lies a unique circle. In [[Cartesian coordinates]], it is possible to give explicit formulae for the coordinates of the centre of the circle and the radius in terms of the coordinates of the three given points. See [[circumcircle]].\n\n===Chord===\n*Chords are equidistant from the centre of a circle if and only if they are equal in length.\n*The [[perpendicular bisector]] of a chord passes through the centre of a circle; equivalent statements stemming from the uniqueness of the perpendicular bisector are:\n**A perpendicular line from the centre of a circle bisects the chord.\n**The [[line segment]] through the centre bisecting a chord is [[perpendicular]] to the chord.\n*If a central angle and an [[inscribed angle]] of a circle are subtended by the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then the central angle is twice the inscribed angle.\n*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on the same side of the chord, then they are equal.\n*If two angles are inscribed on the same chord and on opposite sides of the chord, then they are [[supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n**For a [[cyclic quadrilateral]], the [[exterior angle]] is equal to the interior opposite angle.\n*An inscribed angle subtended by a diameter is a right angle (see [[Thales' theorem]]).\n*The diameter is the longest chord of the circle.\n**Among all the circles with a chord AB in common, the circle with minimal radius is the one with diameter AB.\n*If the [[Intersecting chords theorem|intersection of any two chords]] divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''ab'' {{=}} ''cd''}}.\n*If the intersection of any two perpendicular chords divides one chord into lengths ''a'' and ''b'' and divides the other chord into lengths ''c'' and ''d'', then {{nowrap|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup> + ''c''<sup>2</sup> + ''d''<sup>2</sup>}} equals the square of the diameter.<ref>Posamentier and Salkind, ''Challenging Problems in Geometry'', Dover, 2nd edition, 1996: pp. 104\u2013105, #4\u201323.</ref>\n*The sum of the squared lengths of any two chords intersecting at right angles at a given point is the same as that of any other two perpendicular chords intersecting at the same point, and is given by 8''r'' <sup>2</sup> \u2013 4''p'' <sup>2</sup> (where ''r'' is the circle's radius and ''p'' is the distance from the centre point to the point of intersection).<ref>''[[College Mathematics Journal]]'' 29(4), September 1998, p. 331, problem 635.</ref>\n*The distance from a point on the circle to a given chord times the diameter of the circle equals the product of the distances from the point to the ends of the chord.<ref>Johnson, Roger A., ''Advanced Euclidean Geometry'', Dover Publ., 2007.</ref>{{rp|p.71}}\n\n===Tangent===\n*A line drawn perpendicular to a radius through the end point of the radius lying on the circle is a tangent to the circle.\n*A line drawn perpendicular to a tangent through the point of contact with a circle passes through the centre of the circle.\n*Two tangents can always be drawn to a circle from any point outside the circle, and these tangents are equal in length.\n*If a tangent at ''A'' and a tangent at ''B'' intersect at the exterior point ''P'', then denoting the centre as ''O'', the angles \u2220''BOA'' and \u2220''BPA'' are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]].\n*If ''AD'' is tangent to the circle at ''A'' and if ''AQ'' is a chord of the circle, then {{nowrap|\u2220''DAQ'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}}arc(''AQ'')}}.\n\n===Theorems===\n[[Image:Secant-Secant Theorem.svg|thumb|right|Secant-secant theorem]]\n{{See also|Power of a point}}\n*The chord theorem states that if two chords, ''CD'' and ''EB'', intersect at ''A'', then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}.\n*If two secants, ''AE'' and ''AD'', also cut the circle at ''B'' and ''C'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD'' {{=}} ''AB'' \u00d7 ''AE''}}. (Corollary of the chord theorem.)\n*A tangent can be considered a limiting case of a secant whose ends are coincident. If a [[tangent]] from an external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''F'' and a [[Secant line|secant]] from the external point ''A'' meets the circle at ''C'' and ''D'' respectively, then {{nowrap|''AF''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} ''AC'' \u00d7 ''AD''}}. (Tangent-secant theorem.)\n*The angle between a chord and the tangent at one of its endpoints is equal to one half the angle subtended at the centre of the circle, on the opposite side of the chord (Tangent Chord Angle).\n*If the angle subtended by the chord at the centre is 90 [[Degree (angle)|degrees]] then {{nowrap|''\u2113'' {{=}} ''r'' {{radic|2}}}}, where ''\u2113'' is the length of the chord and ''r'' is the radius of the circle.\n*If two secants are inscribed in the circle as shown at right, then the measurement of angle ''A'' is equal to one half the difference of the measurements of the enclosed arcs (''DE'' and ''BC''). I.e. {{nowrap|2\u2220''CAB'' {{=}} \u2220''DOE'' \u2212 \u2220''BOC'',}} where ''O'' is the centre of the circle. This is the secant-secant theorem.\n\n===Inscribed angles===\n{{See also|Inscribed angle theorem}}\n[[Image:inscribed angle theorem.svg|thumb|200px|right|Inscribed angle theorem]]\nAn [[inscribed angle]] (examples are the blue and green angles in the figure) is exactly half the corresponding [[central angle]] (red). Hence, all inscribed angles that subtend the same arc (pink) are equal. Angles inscribed on the arc (brown) are supplementary. In particular, every inscribed angle that subtends a [[diameter]] is a [[right angle]] (since the central angle is 180 degrees).\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Sagitta===\n[[Image:circle Sagitta.svg|thumb|277px|right|The sagitta is the vertical segment.]]\n*The [[Sagitta (geometry)|sagitta]] (also known as the [[versine]]) is a line segment drawn perpendicular to a chord, between the midpoint of that chord and the arc of the circle.\n*Given the length ''y'' of a chord, and the length ''x'' of the sagitta, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] can be used to calculate the radius of the unique circle that will fit around the two lines:\n:: <math>r=\\frac{y^2}{8x}+ \\frac{x}{2}.</math>\n\nAnother proof of this result, which relies only on two chord properties given above, is as follows. Given a chord of length ''y'' and with sagitta of length ''x'', since the sagitta intersects the midpoint of the chord, we know it is part of a diameter of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, the \"missing\" part of the diameter is ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x''}}) in length. Using the fact that one part of one chord times the other part is equal to the same product taken along a chord intersecting the first chord, we find that ({{nowrap|2''r'' \u2212 ''x'')''x'' {{=}} (''y'' / 2)<sup>2</sup>}}. Solving for ''r'', we find the required result.\n\n==Compass and straightedge constructions ==\n\nThere are many [[compass-and-straightedge construction]]s resulting in circles.\n\nThe simplest and most basic is the construction given the centre of the circle and a point on the circle. Place the fixed leg of the [[Compass (drawing tool)|compass]] on the centre point, the movable leg on the point on the circle and rotate the compass.\n\n=== Construct a circle with a given diameter ===\n\n* Construct the [[midpoint (geometry)|midpoint]] {{math|'''M'''}} of the diameter.\n* Construct the circle with centre {{math|'''M'''}} passing through one of the endpoints of the diameter (it will also pass through the other endpoint).\n\n[[File:Circunferencia 10.svg|thumb|Construct a circle through points A, B and C by finding the perpendicular bisectors (red) of the sides of the triangle (blue).

Stanley]], ''Excursions in Geometry'', Dover, 1969, 14\u201317.</ref> (The set of points where the distances are equal is the perpendicular bisector of segment ''AB'', a line.) That circle is sometimes said to be drawn ''about'' two points.\n\nThe proof is in two parts. First, one must prove that, given two foci ''A'' and ''B'' and a ratio of distances, any point ''P'' satisfying the ratio of distances must fall on a particular circle. Let ''C'' be another point, also satisfying the ratio and lying on segment ''AB''. By the [[angle bisector theorem]] the line segment ''PC'' will bisect the [[interior angle]] ''APB'', since the segments are similar:\n:<math>\\frac{AP}{BP} = \\frac{AC}{BC}.</math>\n\nAnalogously, a line segment ''PD'' through some point ''D'' on ''AB'' extended bisects the corresponding [[exterior angle]] ''BPQ'' where ''Q'' is on ''AP'' extended. Since the interior and exterior angles sum to 180 degrees, the angle ''CPD'' is exactly 90 degrees, i.e., a [[right angle]]. The set of points ''P'' such that angle ''CPD'' is a right angle forms a circle, of which ''CD'' is a diameter.\n\nSecond, see<ref>Altshiller-Court, Nathan, ''College Geometry'', Dover, 2007 (orig. 1952).</ref>{{rp|p.15}} for a proof that every point on the indicated circle satisfies the given ratio.\n\n===Cross-ratios===\nA closely related property of circles involves the geometry of the [[cross-ratio]] of points in the [[complex plane]]. If ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are as above, then the circle of Apollonius for these three points is the collection of points ''P'' for which the absolute value of the cross-ratio is equal to one:\n:<math>|[A,B;C,P]| = 1.\\ </math>\n\nStated another way, ''P'' is a point on the circle of Apollonius if and only if the cross-ratio [''A'',''B'';''C'',''P''] is on the [[unit circle]] in the complex plane.\n\n==={{anchor|Generalized circles}} Generalised circles===\n{{See also|Generalised circle}}\nIf ''C'' is the [[midpoint]] of the segment ''AB'', then the collection of points ''P'' satisfying the Apollonius condition\n:<math>\\frac{|AP|}{|BP|} = \\frac{|AC|}{|BC|}</math>{{pad|1em}}\n\nis not a circle, but rather a line.\n\nThus, if ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are given distinct points in the plane, then the locus of points ''P'' satisfying the above equation is called a \"generalised circle.\" It may either be a true circle or a line. In this sense a [[line (geometry)|line]] is a generalised circle of infinite radius.\n\n==Circles inscribed in or circumscribed about other figures==\nIn every [[triangle]] a unique circle, called the [[Incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]], can be inscribed such that it is [[tangent]] to each of the three sides of the triangle.<ref>[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html Incircle \u2013 from Wolfram MathWorld] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121111333/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Incircle.html |date=2012-01-21 }}.

A well-studied example is the [[cyclic quadrilateral]]. Every regular polygon and every triangle is a cyclic polygon. A polygon that is both cyclic and tangential is called a [[bicentric polygon]].\n\nA [[hypocycloid]] is a curve that is inscribed in a given circle by tracing a fixed point on a smaller circle that rolls within and tangent to the given circle.\n\n==Circle as limiting case of other figures==\nThe circle can be viewed as a [[Limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of each of various other figures:\n*A [[Cartesian oval]] is a set of points such that a [[weighted sum]] of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points ([[Focus (geometry)|foci]]) is a constant. An [[ellipse]] is the case in which the weights are equal. A circle is an ellipse with an [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] of zero, meaning that the two foci coincide with each other as the centre of the circle. A circle is also a different special case of a Cartesian oval in which one of the weights is zero.\n*A [[superellipse]] has an equation of the form <math>\\left|\\frac{x}{a}\\right|^n\\! + \\left|\\frac{y}{b}\\right|^n\\! = 1</math> for positive ''a'', ''b'', and ''n''. A supercircle has {{nowrap|''b'' {{=}} ''a''}}. A circle is the special case of a supercircle in which {{nowrap|''n'' {{=}} 2}}.\n*A [[Cassini oval]] is a set of points such that the product of the distances from any of its points to two fixed points is a constant. When the two fixed points coincide, a circle results.\n*A [[curve of constant width]] is a figure whose width, defined as the perpendicular distance between two distinct parallel lines each intersecting its boundary in a single point, is the same regardless of the direction of those two parallel lines. The circle is the simplest example of this type of figure.\n\n==Circles in other p-norms==\n[[Image:Vector-p-Norms qtl1.svg|thumb|right|Illustrations of [[unit circle]]s (see also [[superellipse]]) in different {{math|''p''}}-norms (every vector from the origin to the unit circle has a length of one, the length being calculated with length-formula of the corresponding {{math|''p''}}).]]\nDefining a circle as the set of points with a fixed distance from a point, different shapes can be considered circles under different definitions of distance. In [[p-norm]], distance is determined by\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _p = \\left( |x_1|^p + |x_2|^p + \\dotsb + |x_n|^p \\right) ^{1/p} .</math>\nIn Euclidean geometry, ''p'' = 2, giving the familiar\n:<math> \\left\\| x \\right\\| _2 = \\sqrt{ |x_1|^2 + |x_2|^2 + \\dotsb + |x_n|^2 } .</math>\n\nIn [[taxicab geometry]], ''p'' = 1. Taxicab circles are [[square (geometry)|square]]s with sides oriented at a 45\u00b0 angle to the coordinate axes. While each side would have length <math>\\sqrt{2}r</math> using a [[Euclidean metric]], where ''r'' is the circle's radius, its length in taxicab geometry is 2''r''. Thus, a circle's circumference is 8''r''. Thus, the value of a geometric analog to [[Pi|<math>\\pi </math>]] is 4 in this geometry. The formula for the unit circle in taxicab geometry is <math>|x| + |y| = 1</math> in [[Cartesian coordinates]] and\n\n:<math>r = \\frac{1}{| \\sin \\theta| + |\\cos\\theta|}</math>\n\nin [[polar coordinates]].\n\nA circle of radius 1 (using this distance) is the [[von Neumann neighborhood]] of its center.\n\nA circle of radius ''r'' for the [[Chebyshev distance]] ([[Lp space|L<sub>\u221e</sub> metric]]) on a plane is also a square with side length 2''r'' parallel to the coordinate axes, so planar Chebyshev distance can be viewed as equivalent by rotation and scaling to planar taxicab distance. However, this equivalence between L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>\u221e</sub> metrics does not generalize to higher dimensions.\n\n==Squaring the circle==\n\n[[Squaring the circle]] is the problem, proposed by [[classical antiquity|ancient]] [[geometers]], of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with [[compass and straightedge]].\n\nIn 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the [[Lindemann\u2013Weierstrass theorem]], which proves that [[pi]] ({{pi}}) is a [[transcendental number]], rather than an [[algebraic number|algebraic irrational number]]; that is, it is not the [[root of a function|root]] of any [[polynomial]] with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients.\n\n==See also==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n\n*[[Affine sphere]]\n*[[Annulus (mathematics)]]\n*[[Apeirogon]]\n*[[Circle fitting]]\n*[[List of circle topics]]\n*[[Sphere]]\n*[[Three points determine a circle]]\n*[[Translation of axes]]\n\n===Specially named circles===\n*[[Unit circle]]\n*[[Apollonian circles]]\n*[[Chromatic circle]]\n*[[Ford circle]]\n*[[Circle of antisimilitude]]\n*[[Carlyle circle]]\n*[[Bankoff circle]]\n*[[Archimedes' twin circles]]\n*[[Archimedean circle]]\n*[[Johnson circles]]\n*[[Schoch circles]]\n*[[Woo circles]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of a triangle====\n*[[Mandart circle]]\n*[[Spieker circle]]\n*[[Nine-point circle]]\n*[[Lemoine circle]]\n*[[Circumcircle]]\n*[[Incircle]]\n*[[Excircle]]\n*[[Incircle and excircles of a triangle#Other excircle properties|Apollonius circle of the excircles]]\n*[[Lester circle]]\n*[[Malfatti circles]]\n*[[Brocard circle]]\n*[[Orthocentroidal circle]]\n*[[Van Lamoen circle]]\n*[[Parry circle]]\n*[[Polar circle (geometry)]]\n\n{{col-break}}\n\n====Of certain quadrilaterals====\n*[[Eight-point circle]] of an orthodiagonal quadrilateral\n*[[Tangential quadrilateral|Incircle of a tangential quadrilateral]]\n*[[Cyclic quadrilateral|Circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral]]\n\n====Of certain polygons====\n*[[Cyclic polygon|Circumcircle of a cyclic polygon]]\n*[[Tangential polygon|Incircle of a tangential polygon]]\n\n====Of a conic section====\n*[[Director circle]]\n*[[Directrix circle]]\n\n====Of a sphere====\n*[[Great circle]]\n*[[Riemannian circle]]\n\n====Of a torus====\n*[[Villarceau circles]]\n\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=Pedoe, Dan |title=Geometry: a comprehensive course |publisher=Dover |year=1988}}\n*[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/history/Curves/Circle.html \"Circle\" in The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive]\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons and category|Circles|Circles}}\n{{wikiquote|Circles}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Circle}}\n* {{springer|title=Circle|id=p/c022260}}\n*[[planetmath:4236|Circle (PlanetMath.org website)]]\n*{{MathWorld |urlname=Circle |title=Circle}}\n*[http://www.mathopenref.com/tocs/circlestoc.html Interactive Java applets] for the properties of and elementary constructions involving circles.\n*[http://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/circle/interactive-circle-equation.php Interactive Standard Form Equation of Circle] Click and drag points to see standard form equation in action\n*[http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/Munching/circle.shtml Munching on Circles] at [[cut-the-knot]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Circles| ]]\n[[Category:Elementary shapes]]\n[[Category:Curves]]\n[[Category:Conic sections]]\n[[Category:Pi]]", "sha1": "fuuizha44goit77gg2vdp0t6b2iz8pe"}}, {"title": "Cardinal (Catholic Church)", "ns": "0", "id": "6221", "revision": {"id": "865434179", "parentid": "865337181", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T22:48:58Z", "contributor": {"username": "Danielmonk", "id": "7918450"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{For|a current list of cardinals|List of living cardinals}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Catholic Church Hierarchy}}\n[[File:External Ornaments of a Cardinal (not a bishop).svg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|The coat of arms of a cardinal is indicated by a red [[galero]] (wide-brimmed hat) with 15 tassels on each side (the [[motto]] and [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] are proper to the individual cardinal).]]\nA '''cardinal''' ({{lang-la|Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae cardinalis}}, literally ''Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church'') is a senior [[Ecclesiology|ecclesiastical]] leader, considered a [[Prince of the Church]], and usually  an ordained [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]] of the [[Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. The cardinals of the Church are collectively known as the [[College of Cardinals]]. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the [[Pope]] as requested. Most have additional duties, such as leading a [[diocese]] or [[archdiocese]] or managing a [[Dicastery|department]] of the [[Roman Curia]]. A cardinal's primary duty is [[papal election|electing the Pope]] when the [[Holy See|see]] becomes vacant. During the ''[[sede vacante]]'' (the period between a pope's death or resignation and the election of his successor), the day-to-day governance of the Holy See is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the [[Papal conclave|conclave]] of cardinals where the pope is elected is limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years by the day the vacancy occurs.\n\nIn 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven [[Suburbicarian diocese|suburbicarian see]]s. In the 12th century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them assigned a church in Rome as his [[titular church]] or linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nThe term ''cardinal'' at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or [[incardinated]] to a church,<ref name=\"CE-cardinal\">{{CathEncy | wstitle=Cardinal | title=Cardinal | last=S\u00e4gm\u00fcller | first=Johannes Baptist}}</ref> or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin ''cardo'' (hinge), meaning \"principal\" or \"chief\". The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the ''tituli'' (parishes) of the [[diocese of Rome]].<ref name=\"CE-cardinal\" />\n\n==History==\n{{further information|Papal selection before 1059}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Richelieu, por Philippe de Champaigne (detalle).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cardinal Richelieu]], chief minister of [[France]]]]\n\nThere is disagreement about the origin of the term, but the consensus that \"''cardinalis''\" from the word ''cardo'' (meaning 'pivot' or 'hinge') was first used in late antiquity to designate a bishop or priest who was incorporated into a church for which he had not originally been ordained. In [[Rome]] the first persons to be called cardinals were the deacons of the seven regions of the city at the beginning of the 6th century, when the word began to mean \"principal,\" \"eminent,\" or \"superior.\" The name was also given to the senior priest in each of the \"title\" churches (the parish churches) of Rome and to the bishops of the seven sees surrounding the city. By the 8th century the Roman cardinals constituted a privileged class among the Roman clergy. They took part in the administration of the church of Rome and in the papal liturgy. By decree of [[Lateran Council (769)|a synod of 769]], only a cardinal was eligible to become bishop of Rome. Cardinals were granted the privilege of wearing the red hat by Pope [[Innocent IV]] in 1244.<ref>Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica</ref>\n\nIn cities other than Rome, the name cardinal began to be applied to certain church men as a mark of honour. The earliest example of this occurs in a letter sent by [[Pope Zacharias]] in 747 to [[Pippin III]] (the Short), ruler of the [[Franks]], in which Zacharias applied the title to the priests of [[Paris]] to distinguish them from country clergy. This meaning of the word spread rapidly, and from the 9th century various episcopal cities had a special class among the clergy known as cardinals. The use of the title was reserved for the cardinals of Rome in 1567 by [[Pius V]].\n\nIn the year 1563 the influential Ecumenical Council of Trent, headed by Pope [[Pius IV]], wrote about the importance of selecting good Cardinals. According to this historic council \"nothing is more necessary to the Church of God than that the holy Roman pontiff apply that solicitude which by the duty of his office he owes the universal Church in a very special way by associating with himself as cardinals the most select persons only, and appoint to each church most eminently upright and competent shepherds; and this the more so, because our Lord Jesus Christ will require at his hands the blood of the sheep of Christ that perish through the evil government of shepherds who are negligent and forgetful of their office.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catholic bishops and Pope Pius IV|title=The Council of Trent|date=11 November 1563|publisher=Tan Books and Publishers}}</ref>\n\nThe earlier influence of temporal rulers, notably the French kings, reasserted itself through the influence of cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements. Traditions even developed entitling certain monarchs, including those of Austria, Spain, and France, to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called ''[[crown-cardinal]]''.<ref name=\"Chadwick\">{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=Owen|title=The Popes and European Revolution|date=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198269199|page=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XrLmCwAAQBAJ&dq}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Early Modern period|early modern]] times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. In [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s England, his chief minister was [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]]. [[Cardinal Richelieu]]'s power was so great that he was for many years effectively the ruler of France.<ref>Henry Kitchell Webster, Hutton Webster, ''Early European History'', p. 604.

[[Guillaume Dubois]] and [[Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury]] complete the list of the four great cardinals to have ruled [[France]].<ref name=\"Chadwick\" /> In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, [[Henry, King of Portugal]], was crowned king, the only example of a cardinal-king.\n\nWhile the incumbents of some sees are regularly made cardinals, and some countries are entitled to at least one cardinal by [[concordate]] (usually earning either its [[primate (bishop)|primate]] or the metropolitan of the capital city the cardinal's hat), no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate, not even if its bishop is a Patriarch.\n\n==Papal elections==\nIn 1059, [[Pope Nicholas II]] gave cardinals the right to elect the bishop of Rome in the [[papal bull]] ''[[In nomine Domini]]''. For a time this power was assigned exclusively to the cardinal bishops, but in 1179 the [[Third Lateran Council]] restored the right to the whole body of cardinals.<ref name=TCE1>{{cite book |last=Fanning |first=W. |editor-first=|editor-last=|title=The Catholic Encyclopaedia |publisher=Robert Appleton Company |year=1911 |pages= |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11456a.htm |chapter=Papal Elections |isbn= 0840731752}}</ref>\n\n==Numbers==\nIn 1586 [[Pope Sixtus V]] limited the number of cardinals to 70:<ref>{{cite news | accessdate = 25 October 2017 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1958/11/18/83425668.pdf | first=Arnaldo | last=Cortesi | work= New York Times | date= 18 November 2017 | title = Two Americans among 23 New Cardinals}}</ref> six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons.

Since then, cardinals have been advanced to cardinal bishop exclusively by papal appointment. Those appointed to be cardinal-bishops are usually already cardinals, but their seniority within the order of cardinal bishops is determined by the date of their elevation to the order of cardinal bishop, rather than by the date they originally became cardinals of a lesser order.\n\nOn June 26, 2018, it was announced that, corresponding to the expansion in cardinal priests and cardinal deacons in recent decades, there will be an expansion in cardinal bishops (of Roman titles).  Four cardinals, effective June 28, were elevated to this rank by having their titular churches co-opted to suburbicarian rank.<ref>{{cite document | accessdate = 26 June 2018 | url = http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2018/06/26/180626c.html | publisher =Holy See Press Office | date= 26 June 2018 | title = Rescriptum of the Holy Father Francis ...}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | | work =National Catholic Reporter | date= 26 June 2018 | url = https://www.ncronline.org/news/vatican/new-papal-appointments-reflect-popes-wish-transparency | accessdate = 26 June 2018 | title = New papal appointments reflect pope's wish for transparency| agency = Catholic News Service | first = Carol | last = Glatz}}</ref> At the time of the announcement, all six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian see titles, as well as two of the three cardinal patriarchs, were non-electors because of having reached age 80.\n\n==== Dean and Vice-Dean of the College of Cardinals ====\n{{main|Dean of the College of Cardinals}}\nThe Dean of the College of Cardinals, or Cardinal Dean, is the ''[[primus inter pares]]'' of the [[College of Cardinals]], elected by the [[Latin Rite]] cardinal bishops from among their own number, an election, however, that must be approved by the Pope. The position of Dean formerly belonged by right to the longest-serving of the cardinal bishops. The Vice-Dean is similarly elected by the Latin Rite cardinal bishops from among their own number with the Pope's approval and also formerly belonged by right to the second-longest-serving of the cardinal bishops.\n\n==== Cardinal patriarchs ====\nIn 1965, [[Pope Paul VI]] decreed in his ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''Ad Purpuratorum Patrum Collegium'' that [[patriarch]]s of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named cardinals (i.e., patriarch cardinals) would also be cardinal bishops, ranking after the six cardinal bishops of the suburbicarian sees.<ref>{{cite document| title=Ad Purpuratorum Patrum Collegium | url= http://w2.vatican.va/content/paul-vi/la/motu_proprio/documents/hf_p-vi_motu-proprio_19650211_ad-purpuratorum.html | publisher= Libreria Editrice Vaticana | accessdate=3 December 2017 | author= Pope Paul VI | language=la | date=11 February 1965}}</ref> Unlike all other cardinals, these patriarch cardinals do not receive any title associated with the [[Diocese of Rome]]. Unlike the other cardinal bishops, they do not participate in electing the dean nor can they be chosen dean. \n\nThere are currently four Eastern Patriarchs who are cardinal bishops:\n* [[Nasrallah Sfeir]], [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch Emeritus of Antioch]] of the [[Maronite]]s\n* [[Antonios Naguib]], [[List of Coptic Catholic Patriarchs of Alexandria|Patriarch Emeritus of Alexandria of the Copts]]\n* [[Bechara Boutros al-Rahi]], [[List of Maronite Patriarchs|Patriarch of Antioch]] of the [[Maronite]]s\n* [[Louis Rapha\u00ebl I Sako]], [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans]]\n\nIf a Latin Rite prelate who carries the title patriarch, such as that of [[Patriarchate of Venice|Venice]] or [[Patriarchate of Lisbon|Lisbon]], becomes a cardinal, he ranks as a cardinal priest, not automatically as a cardinal bishop, unless specifically appointed as one.\n\n=== Cardinal priests ===\nCardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops.<ref>[http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/dictionary/index.cfm?id=32336 John Hardon, ''Modern Catholic Dictionary'']</ref> Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|bishop]]s of important [[diocese]]s throughout the world, though some hold [[Roman Curia|Curial]] positions.\n\nIn modern times, the name \"cardinal priest\" is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the ''cardinal'' priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as [[Bishop]] of [[diocese of Rome|Rome]] (the Latin ''cardo'' means \"hinge\"). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel\u2014the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope.\n\n[[File:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumb|left|Cardinal-priest [[Thomas Wolsey]]]]\nWhile the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and [[Roman Curia]], every cardinal priest has a [[titular church]] in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops are given one of the [[suburbicarian diocese]]s around Rome. [[Pope Paul VI]] abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal's name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to celebrate mass and preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.\n\nWhile the number of cardinals was small from the times of the [[Roman Empire]] to the [[Renaissance]], and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, [[Pope Sixtus V]] sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum [[Size of the College of Cardinals|size of the College]] at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When [[Pope John XXIII]] abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes [[Pope Paul VI|Paul VI]] and [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.\n\nThe cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled ''cardinal [[protopriest]]''. He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is [[Michael Michai Kitbunchu]] of [[Thailand]].\n\n=== Cardinal deacons ===\nThe cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the [[Roman Curia]] or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests.\n\nCardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the [[Papal Household]] and the seven deacons who supervised the Church's works in the districts of [[Rome]] during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries.\n\nCardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the [[Roman Curia]] holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important, they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied.<ref name=\"Thomas J. Reese p. 92-93\">Thomas J. Reese, '' Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church'',  Harvard University Press, 1996 p. 92-93</ref> Under the 1587 decree of [[Pope Sixtus V]], which fixed the maximum [[size of the College of Cardinals]], there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II maintained this ratio.<ref name=\"Thomas J. Reese p. 92-93\"/>\n\nAs of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to \"opt for the order of cardinal priests\" (''optazione'') after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant \"[[titular church|title]]\" (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest's \"title\" for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).\n\nWhen not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual ''[[Urbi et Orbi]]'' [[papal blessing]], some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the [[dalmatic]]s they would don with the simple white mitre (so called ''mitra simplex'').\n\n==== Cardinal protodeacon ====\nThe cardinal protodeacon is the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals. If he is a cardinal elector and participates in a conclave, he [[Habemus Papam|announces a new pope's election]] and name{{efn|once he has been ordained to the episcopate<ref>Ap. Const.

For example, in the 16th century, [[Reginald Pole]] was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests,<ref>Canon 232 \u00a71 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law</ref> and, in 1962, [[Pope John XXIII]] set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as [[bishop (Catholic Church)|bishops]], even if they are only priests at the time of appointment.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_j-xxiii_motu-proprio_19620415_cum-gravissima_lt.html Motu proprio ''Cum gravissima'', 15 April 1962] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302231616/http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_xxiii/motu_proprio/documents/hf_j-xxiii_motu-proprio_19620415_cum-gravissima_lt.html |date=2 March 2013 }}</ref> As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of [[priesthood (Catholic Church)|priesthood]] at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained [[Dispensation (Catholic Church)|dispensation]] from the rule of having to be a bishop.{{efn|Examples include [[Domenico Bartolucci]], [[Karl Josef Becker]], [[Yves Congar]], [[Aloys Grillmeier]], [[Henri de Lubac]], [[Julien Ries]], [[Leo Scheffczyk]], [[Roberto Tucci]] and [[Albert Vanhoye]].}} These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but [[Roberto Tucci]] and [[Albert Vanhoye]] lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest.\n\nA cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other [[pontificalia]] (episcopal regalia: [[mitre]], [[crozier]], [[zucchetto]], [[pectoral cross]] and ring). Even if not a bishop, any cardinal has both actual and honorary precedence over non-cardinal patriarchs, as well as the archbishops and bishops who are not cardinals, but he cannot perform the functions reserved solely to bishops, such as [[Holy Orders|ordination]]. The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it, and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent [[papal conclave]]s.\n\n===\"Lay cardinals\"===\n{{Main article|Lay cardinal}}\nAt various times, there have been cardinals who had only received [[tonsure#Western Christianity|first tonsure]] and [[minor orders]] but not yet been [[Holy Orders|ordained]] as [[deacon]]s or priests. Though [[clergy|clerics]], they were inaccurately called \"[[lay cardinal]]s\". [[Teodolfo Mertel]] was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the [[Code of Canon Law]] promulgated in 1917 by [[Pope Benedict XV]], only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_PO.HTM canon 232 \u00a71] of the 1917 Code of Canon Law</ref> Since the time of [[Pope John XXIII]] a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.<ref>Cf.

In the modern era popes have named cardinals ''in pectore'' to protect them or their congregations from political reprisals. If conditions change, the pope makes the appointment public. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those made cardinals at the time of his ''in pectore'' appointment.

The E codex from El Escorial is illuminated with colored [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] showing pairs of musicians playing a wide variety of [[musical instrument|instruments]].

The Cantigas depict the Virgin Mary in a very humanized way, often having her play a role in earthly episodes.\n\nThe authors are unknown, although several studies have suggested that [[Galicia (Spain)|Galician]] poet [[Airas Nunes]] might have been the author of a large number of the Cantiga poems. King Alfonso X &mdash; named as Affonso in the Cantigas &mdash; is also believed to be an author of some of them as he refers himself in first person. Support for this theory can be found in the prologue of the Cantigas. Also, many sources credit Alfonso owing to his influence on other works within the poetic tradition, including his introduction on religious song. Although King Alfonso X's authorship is debatable, his influence is not. While the other major works that came out of Alfonso's workshops, including histories and other prose texts, were in [[Castilian language|Castilian]], the Cantigas are in Galician-Portuguese, and reflect the popularity in the Castilian court of other poetic corpuses such as the [[cantigas d'amigo]] and cantigas d'amor.\n\n[[Image:MALaute1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A [[lute]] player.]]\nThe metrics are extraordinarily diverse: 280 different formats for the 420 Cantigas. The most common are the ''[[virelai]]'' and the ''[[Rondeau (music)|rondeau]]''. The length of the lines varies between two and 24 syllables. The narrative voice in many of the songs describes an erotic relationship, in the troubadour fashion, with the Divine.\nThe music is written in notation which is similar to that used for chant, but also contains some information about the length of the notes. Several transcriptions exist.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ferreira |first1=Manuel Pedro |title=Rhythmic paradigms in the Cantigas de Santa Maria: French versus Arabic precedent |journal=Plainsong and Medieval Music |date=2015 |volume=24 |issue=1 }}</ref> The Cantigas are frequently recorded and performed by [[Early Music]] groups, and quite a few CDs featuring music from the Cantigas are available.\n\n[[Image:Vihuela_de_arco_y_vihuela_de_p\u00e9\u00f1ola_en_las_Cantigas.jpg|left|thumb|301px|Musicians playing the Spanish vihuela.]]\n===Codices===\n[[File:13th-century unknown painters - Cantigas de Alfonso el Sabio - WGA16031.jpg|thumb|left|Miniatures, Cantiga #35]]\nThe Cantigas are preserved in four manuscripts:<ref name=\"mettmann\">Walter Mettmann, ''Alfonso X. el Sabio: Cantigas de Santa Maria'', Cl\u00e1sicos Castalia, Madrid 1986\u20131989.</ref> ''To'' (''c\u00f3dice de Toledo,'' Biblioteca Nacional de Espa\u00f1a, MS 10069), ''T'' (Biblioteca de [[El Escorial]], MS T.I.1), ''F'' (''c\u00f3dice de Florencia,'' [[Florence]], Biblioteca Nazionale, MS b.r. 20) and ''E'' (''c\u00f3dice de los m\u00fasicos,'' Biblioteca de [[El Escorial]] MS B.I.2). ''E'' contains the largest number of songs (406 Cantigas, plus the Introduction and the Prologue); it contains 41 carefully detailed miniatures and many illuminated letters. ''To'' is the earliest collection and contains 129 songs. Although not illustrated, it is richly decorated with pen flourished initials, and great care has been taken over its construction. The ''T'' and ''F'' manuscripts are sister volumes. ''T'' contains 195 surviving cantigas (8 are missing due to loss of folios) which roughly correspond in order to the first two hundred in ''E'', each song being illustrated with either 6 or 12 miniatures that depict scenes from the cantiga. ''F'' follows the same format but has only 111 cantigas, of which 7 have no text, only miniatures. These are basically a subset of those found in the second half of ''E'', but are presented here in a radically different order. ''F'' was never finished, and so no music was ever added. Only the empty staves display the intention to add musical notation to the codex at a later date. It is generally thought that the codices were constructed during Alfonso's lifetime, ''To'' perhaps in the 1270s, and ''T''/''F'' and ''E'' in the early 1280s up until the time of his death in 1284.\n\n===The music===\n\nThe musical forms within the Cantigas, and there are many, are still being studied. There have been many false leads, and there is little beyond pitch value that is very reliable. Mensuration is a particular problem in the Cantigas, and most attempts at determining meaningful rhythmic schemes have tended, with some exceptions, to be unsatisfactory. This remains a lively topic of debate and study. Progress, while on-going, has nevertheless been significant over the course of the last 20 years.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Cantiga de amigo]]\n*[[Llibre Vermell de Montserrat]]\n*[[Pergaminho Sharrer]]\n*[[Martim Codax]]\n*[[The Legend of Ero of Armenteira]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* Galliano Ciliberti, ''L'infanzia salvata nell\u2019immaginario poetico e musicale del medioevo'', in Galliano Ciliberti (a cura di), ''La musica ricercata.

A composer of both [[Secular music|secular]] and [[Religious music|sacred music]], and a pioneer in the development of [[opera]], he is considered a crucial transitional figure between the [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] and the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] periods of music history.\n\nBorn in [[Cremona]], where he undertook his first musical studies and compositions, Monteverdi developed his career first at the court of [[Mantua]] (c. 1590\u20131613) and then until his death in the [[Republic of Venice]] where he was ''maestro di capella'' at the basilica of [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]]. His surviving letters give insight into the life of a professional musician in Italy of the period, including problems of income, patronage and politics.\n\nMuch of Monteverdi's output, including many stage works, [[Lost operas by Claudio Monteverdi|has been lost]]. His surviving music includes nine books of [[madrigal]]s, large-scale sacred works such as his ''[[Vespro della Beata Vergine]]'' (''Vespers'') of 1610, and three complete operas. His opera ''[[L'Orfeo]]'' (1607) is the earliest of the genre still widely performed; towards the end of his life he wrote works for the commercial theatre in Venice, including ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]'' and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]''.\n\nWhile he worked extensively in the tradition of earlier Renaissance [[polyphony]], such as in his madrigals, he undertook great developments in form and melody, and began to employ the [[basso continuo]] technique, distinctive of the Baroque. No stranger to controversy, he defended his sometimes novel techniques as elements of a ''[[seconda pratica]]'', contrasting with the more orthodox earlier style which he termed the ''prima pratica''. Largely forgotten during the eighteenth and much of the nineteenth centuries, his works enjoyed a rediscovery around the beginning of the twentieth century. He is now established both as a significant influence in European musical history and as a composer whose works are regularly performed and recorded.\n\n== Life ==\n===Background: Italy in the time of Monteverdi===\nMonteverdi is usually described as an \"Italian\" composer, even though in his lifetime the concept of \"Italy\" existed only as a geographical entity. Although the inhabitants of the peninsula shared much in common in terms of history, culture and language, in political terms the people experienced various layers of (mostly foreign) authority and jurisdiction. In the first instance they were subject to the local rulers of their city-states, powerful families such as the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzagas]] and the [[House of Medici|Medicis]]. Above them were the imperial powers \u2013 in the sixteenth century primarily Spain \u2013 and also the authority of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs of Vienna]], in their role as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]s, guardians of the Catholic faith.<ref>Pryer (2007), pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n\n===Cremona 1567\u20131591===\nMonteverdi was baptised in the church of SS Nazaro e Celso, Cremona, on 15 May 1567. The register records his name as \"Claudio Zuan Antonio\" the son of \"Messer Baldasar Mondeverdo\".<ref name=fabbri6>Fabbri (2007), p. 6</ref> He was the first child of the apothecary Baldassare Monteverdi and his first wife Maddalena (n\u00e9e Zignani); they had married early the previous year. Claudio's brother [[Giulio Cesare Monteverdi]] (b. 1573) was also to become a musician; there were two other brothers and two sisters from Baldassare's marriage to Maddalena and his subsequent marriage in 1576 or 1577.<ref name=Carter1>Carter and Chew (n.d.), \u00a71 \"Cremona\"</ref> Cremona lay under the jurisdiction of [[Milan]], a Spanish possession, so that Monteverdi was technically born a Spanish subject.{{refn|The 1559 [[Italian War of 1551\u201359#Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis (1559)|Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]], signed between France and Spain in April 1559, recognised Spanish sovereignty over various Italian possessions, including the [[Duchy of Milan]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]].<ref>Setton (1984), pp. 708\u201309</ref> Monteverdi would encounter further connections with Spain during his twenty years at the [[Mantua|Court of Mantua]]; according to the musicologist Anthony Pryer, the extent to which these Spanish connections affected Monteverdi's music has yet to be the subject of scholarly study.<ref>Pryer (2007), pp. 6\u20137</ref>|group=n}} Cremona was close to the border of the Republic of Venice, and not far from the lands controlled by [[Mantua]], in both of which states Monteverdi was later to establish his career.<ref name=fabbri6 />\n\n[[File:Cremona Duomo.jpg|right|thumb|Cremona Cathedral, where Monteverdi's teacher Ingegneri was ''maestro di capella'']]There is no clear record of Monteverdi's early musical training, or evidence that (as is sometimes claimed) he was a member of the Cathedral choir or studied at Cremona University. Monteverdi's first published work, a set of [[motets]], ''{{lang|la|Sacrae cantiunculae}} (Sacred Songs)'' for three voices, was issued in Venice in 1582, when he was only fifteen years old. In this, and his other initial publications, he describes himself as the pupil of [[Marc'Antonio Ingegneri]], who was from 1581 (and possibly from 1576) to 1592 the ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' at [[Cremona Cathedral]]. The musicologist [[Tim Carter (musicologist)|Tim Carter]] deduces that Ingegneri \"gave him a solid grounding in [[counterpoint]] and composition\", and that Monteverdi would also have studied playing instruments of the [[viol]] family and singing.<ref name=Carter1/><ref>Carter (2002), p. 1</ref><ref name=whenhamxv>Whenham (2007) \"Chronology\", p. xv.</ref><ref name=Arnold515>Arnold (1980a), p. 515</ref>\n\nMonteverdi's first publications also give evidence of his connections beyond Cremona, even in his early years. His second published work, ''Madrigali spirituali'' (Spiritual Madrigals, 1583), was printed at [[Brescia]]. His next works (his first published secular compositions) were sets of five-part [[madrigal]]s, according to his biographer Paolo Fabbri \"the inevitable proving ground for any composer of the second half of the sixteenth century&nbsp;... the secular genre ''par excellence''\". The first book of madrigals (Venice, 1587) was dedicated to Count Marco Verit\u00e0 of [[Verona]]; the second book of madrigals (Venice, 1590) was dedicated to the President of the [[Senate]] of Milan, Giacomo Ricardi, for whom he had played the [[viola da braccio]] in 1587.<ref name=Carter1/><ref name=whenhamxv /><ref>Fabbri (2007), p. 15</ref>\n\n===Mantua 1591\u20131613===\n====Court musician====\n[[File:Vincenzo I Gonzaga nel giorno dell%E2%80%99incoronazione.jpg|thumb|right|upright=|Duke Vincenzo I Gonzaga in his coronation robes (1587)]] In the dedication of his second book of madrigals, Monteverdi had described himself as a player of the ''vivuola'' (which could mean either [[viola da gamba]] or viola da braccio).<ref name=Arnold515 /><ref>Bates (2002), p. 53</ref>{{refn|The viola da gamba (literally 'violin on the leg'), was held upright between the knees; the viola da braccio ('violin on the arm'), like the modern violin, was held beneath the chin.<ref>Holman (n.d.)</ref>|group=n}} In 1590 or 1591 he entered the service of Duke [[Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Vincenzo I Gonzaga]] of Mantua; he recalled in his dedication to the Duke of his third book of madrigals (Venice, 1592) that \"the most noble exercise of the ''vivuola'' opened to me the fortunate way into your service.\"<ref>Holman (1993), p. 577</ref> In the same dedication he compares his instrumental playing to \"flowers\" and his compositions as \"fruit\" which as it matures \"can more worthily and more perfectly serve you\", indicating his intentions to establish himself as a composer.<ref>Fabbri (1994), pp. 27\u201328</ref>\n\nDuke Vincenzo was keen to establish his court as a musical centre, and sought to recruit leading musicians. When Monteverdi arrived in Mantua, the ''maestro di capella'' at the court was the [[Flanders|Flemish]] musician [[Giaches de Wert]]. Other notable musicians at the court during this period included the composer and violinist [[Salomone Rossi]], Rossi's sister the singer [[Madama Europa]], and the [[tenor]] Francesco Rasi.<ref>Stevens (1995), p. 20</ref> Monteverdi married the court singer Claudia de Cattaneis in 1599; they were to have three children, two sons (Francesco, b. 1601 and Massimiliano, b. 1604), and a daughter who died soon after birth in 1603.<ref name=Arnold515 /> Monteverdi's brother Giulio Cesare joined the court musicians in 1602.<ref name = Ab534>Arnold (1980b), pp. 534\u201335</ref>\n\nWhen Wert died in 1596, his post was given to [[Benedetto Pallavicino]], but Monteverdi was clearly highly regarded by Vincenzo and accompanied him on his military campaigns in Hungary (1595) and also on a visit to Flanders in 1599.<ref name=Arnold515 /> Here at the town of [[Spa]] he is reported by his brother Giulio Cesare as encountering, and bringing back to Italy, the ''canto alla francese''. (The meaning of this, literally \"song in the French style\", is debatable, but may refer to the French-influenced poetry of [[Gabriello Chiabrera]], some of which was set by Monteverdi in his ''Scherzi musicali'', and which departs from the traditional Italian style of lines of 9 or 11 syllables).<ref name=Carter2 /><ref>Vartolo, Sergio (n.d.), [https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.553317&catNum=553317&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English# \"About this recording\"], liner notes, ''Monteverdi: Scherzi Musicali a Tre Voci'', [[Naxos Records]], Catalogue number 8.553317\n</ref> Monteverdi may possibly have been a member of Vincenzo's entourage at [[Florence]] in 1600 for the marriage of [[Marie de' Medici|Maria de' Medici]] and [[Henry IV of France]], at which celebrations [[Jacopo Peri]]'s opera ''[[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]]'' (the earliest surviving opera) was premiered.

The influential [[Bologna|Bolognese]] theorist [[Giovanni Maria Artusi]] attacked Monteverdi's music (without naming the composer) in his work ''L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (Artusi, or On the imperfections of modern music)'' of 1600, followed by a sequel in 1603. Artusi cited extracts from Monteverdi's works not yet published (they later formed parts of his fourth and fifth books of madrigals of 1603 and 1605), condemning their use of [[harmony]] and their innovations in use of musical [[mode (music)|modes]], compared to orthodox [[polyphony|polyphonic]] practice of the sixteenth century.<ref name=Carter2 /> Artusi attempted to correspond with Monteverdi on these issues; the composer refused to respond, but found a champion in a [[pseudonym]]ous supporter, \"L'Ottuso Academico\" (\"The Obtuse Academic\").<ref>Bowers (2007), p. 59</ref> Eventually Monteverdi replied in the preface to the fifth book of madrigals that his duties at court prevented him from a detailed reply; but in a note to \"the studious reader\", he claimed that he would shortly publish a response, ''Seconda Pratica, overo Perfettione della Moderna Musica (The Second Style, or Perfection of Modern Music).''<ref>Bowers (2007), p. 63</ref> This work never appeared, but a later publication by Claudio's brother Giulio Cesare made it clear that the ''[[seconda pratica]]'' which Monteverdi defended was not seen by him as radical change or his own invention, but was an evolution from previous styles (''[[prima pratica]]'') which was complementary to them.<ref>Bowers (2007), p. 66</ref>\n\nThis debate seems in any case to have raised the composer's profile, leading to reprints of his earlier books of madrigals.<ref name=Arnold515 /> Some of his madrigals were published in [[Copenhagen]] in 1605 and 1606, and the poet Tommaso Stigliani published a eulogy of him in his 1605 poem \"O sirene de' fiumi\".<ref name=Carter2 /> The composer of [[madrigal comedy|madrigal comedies]] and theorist [[Adriano Banchieri]] wrote in 1609: \"I must not neglect to mention the most noble of composers, Monteverdi&nbsp;... his expressive qualities are truly deserving of the highest commendation, and we find in them countless examples of matchless declamation&nbsp;... enhanced by comparable harmonies.\"<ref>Stevens (1995), p. 214</ref> The modern music historian Massimo Ossi has placed the Artusi issue in the context of Monteverdi's artistic development: \"If the controversy seems to define Monteverdi's historical position, it also seems to have been about stylistic developments that by 1600 Monteverdi had already outgrown\".<ref>Ossi (2007), p. 100</ref>\n\nThe non-appearance of Monteverdi's promised explanatory treatise may have been a deliberate ploy, since by 1608, by Monteverdi's reckoning, Artusi had become fully reconciled to modern trends in music, and the ''seconda pratica'' was by then well established; Monteverdi had no need to revisit the issue.<ref name= Chrissochoidis>{{cite web|last= Chrisssochoidis|first= Ilias|title= The \"Artusi-Monteverdi\" controversy: Background, content, and modern interpretations|url= https://www.academia.edu/249264/The_Artusi-Monteverdi_controversy_Background_content_and_modern_interpretations|publisher= King's College, London|date= 27 March 2015|accessdate= 9 July 2017}}</ref> On the other hand, letters to [[Giovanni Battista Doni]] of 1632 show that Monteverdi was still preparing a defence of the ''seconda practica'', in a treatise entitled ''Melodia''; he may still have been working on this at the time of his death ten years later.<ref>Stevens (1995), pp. 420\u201322</ref>\n\n====Opera, conflict and departure====\n\n[[File:Francesco Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, by workshop of Frans Pourbus the Younger.jpg|thumb|upright=|right|Duke Francesco IV Gonzaga, by the studio of [[Frans Pourbus the Younger]]]]\nIn 1606 Vincenzo's heir [[Francesco IV Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Francesco]] commissioned from Monteverdi the opera ''[[L'Orfeo]]'', to a [[libretto]] by [[Alessandro Striggio the Younger|Alessandro Striggio]], for the [[Carnival]] season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; the singers included, in the title role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of ''Euridice'' witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera ''[[L'Arianna]]'' (libretto by [[Ottavio Rinuccini]]), intended for the celebration of the marriage of Francesco to [[Margaret of Savoy, Vicereine of Portugal|Margherita of Savoy]]. All the music for this opera is lost apart from ''Ariadne's Lament'', which became extremely popular.{{refn|As late as 1932, the composer [[Francesco Malipiero]] commented that of all Monteverdi's works, \"only ''Ariadne's Lament'' has prevented us from completely forgetting the most famous composer of the seventeenth century.\"<ref>Malipiero (1932), p. 383</ref>|group=n}} To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment ''[[Il ballo delle ingrate]]''.<ref name=Carter2 /><ref>Whenham (2007) \"Chronology\", p. xvii</ref><ref>Pryer (2007), p. 12</ref>\n\nThe strain of the hard work Monteverdi had been putting into these and other compositions was exacerbated by personal tragedies. His wife died in September 1607 and the young singer [[Caterina Martinelli]], intended for the title role of ''Arianna'', died of [[smallpox]] in March 1608. Monteverdi also resented his increasingly poor financial treatment by the Gonzagas. He retired to Cremona in 1608 to convalesce, and wrote a bitter letter to Vincenzo's minister Annibale Chieppio in November of that year seeking (unsuccessfully) \"an honourable dismissal\".<ref>Stevens (1995), pp. 46\u201354</ref> Although the Duke increased Monteverdi's salary and pension, and Monteverdi returned to continue his work at the court, he began to seek patronage elsewhere. After publishing his ''Vespers'' in 1610, which were dedicated to [[Pope Paul V]], he visited Rome, ostensibly hoping to place his son Francesco at a [[seminary]], but apparently also seeking alternative employment. In the same year he may also have visited Venice, where a large collection of his church music was being printed, with a similar intention.<ref name=Carter2 /><ref name=Arnold516>Arnold (1980a), p. 516</ref>\n\nDuke Vincenzo died on 18 February 1612. When Francesco succeeded him, court intrigues and cost-cutting let to the dismissal of Monteverdi and his brother Giulio Cesare, who both returned, almost penniless, to Cremona. Despite Francesco's own death from smallpox in December 1612, Monteverdi was unable to return to favour with his successor, his brother [[Ferdinando Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga]]. In 1613, following the death of [[Giulio Cesare Martinengo]], Monteverdi auditioned for his post as ''maestro'' at the [[basilica of San Marco]] in Venice, for which he submitted music for a Mass. He was appointed in August 1613, and given 50 [[ducats]] for his expenses (of which he was robbed, together with his other belongings, by highwaymen at [[Sanguinetto]] on his return to Cremona).<ref name=Carter2 /><ref name= Stevens83>Stevens (1995), pp. 83\u201385</ref>\n\n===Venice 1613\u20131643===\n====Maturity: 1613\u20131630====\n[[File:Veneza47.jpg|thumb|right|The basilica of [[St Mark's Basilica|San Marco]], Venice]]\nMartinengo had been ill for some time before his death and had left the music of San Marco in a fragile state. The choir had been neglected and the administration overlooked.<ref name= Stevens83/> When Monteverdi arrived to take up his post, his principal responsibility was to recruit, train, discipline and manage the musicians of San Marco (the ''capella''), who amounted to about 30 singers and six instrumentalists; the numbers could be increased for major events.<ref name= Fabbri128>Fabbri (2007), pp. 128\u201329</ref> Among the recruits to the choir was [[Francesco Cavalli]], who joined in 1616 at the age of 14; he was to remain connected with San Marco throughout his life, and was to develop a close association with Monteverdi.<ref name=Cavalli>Walker and Alm (n.d.)</ref> Monteverdi also sought to expand the repertory, including not only the traditional ''[[a cappella]]'' repertoire of Roman and Flemish composers, but also examples of the modern style which he favoured, including the use of [[basso continuo|continuo]] and other instruments.<ref name= Fabbri128/> Apart from this he was of course expected to compose music for all the major feasts of the church. This included a new [[Mass (Catholic Church)|mass]] each year for [[Holy Cross Day]] and [[Christmas Eve]], [[cantata]]s in honour of the Venetian [[Doge]], and numerous other works (many of which are lost).<ref>Fabbri (2007), pp. 134\u201335</ref> Monteverdi was also free to obtain income by providing music for other Venetian churches and for other patrons, and was frequently commissioned to provide music for state banquets. The [[Procurator of San Marco|Procurators of San Marco]], to whom Monteverdi was directly responsible, showed their satisfaction with his work in 1616 by raising his annual salary from 300 [[ducat]]s to 400.<ref name=Carter3 />\n\nThe relative freedom which the Republic of Venice afforded him, compared to the problems of court politics in Mantua, are reflected in Monteverdi's letters to Striggio, particularly his letter of 13 March 1620, when he rejects an invitation to return to Mantua, extolling his present position and finances in Venice, and referring to the pension which Mantua still owes him.<ref>Stevens (1995), pp. 188\u201394</ref> Nonetheless, remaining a Mantuan citizen, he accepted commissions from the new Duke Ferdinando, who had formally renounced his position as Cardinal in 1616 to take on the duties of state. These included the ''[[Ballo#The baroque ballo|balli]]'' ''Tirsi e Clori'' (1616) and ''Apollo'' (1620), an opera ''[[Lost operas by Claudio Monteverdi#Andromeda (1618\u201320)|Andromeda]]'' (1620) and an ''[[intermedio]]'', ''[[Lost operas by Claudio Monteverdi#Le nozze di Tetide (1616\u201317)|Le nozze di Tetide]]'', for the marriage of Ferdinando with [[Catherine de' Medici, Governor of Siena|Caterina de' Medici]] (1617). Most of these compositions were extensively delayed in creation \u2013 partly, as shown by surviving correspondence, through the composer's unwillingness to prioritise them, and partly because of constant changes in the court's requirements.{{refn|Monteverdi's letters provide a detailed account of the various procrastinations and delays.<ref>Stevens (1995), pp. 106\u201350</ref>|group=n}} They are now lost, apart from ''Tirsi e Clori'', which was included in the seventh book of madrigals (published 1619) and dedicated to the Duchess Caterina, for which the composer received a pearl necklace from the Duchess.<ref name=Arnold516 /><ref name=Carter3 /><ref>Arnold (1980a), p. 531</ref> A subsequent major commission, the opera ''[[Lost operas by Claudio Monteverdi#La finta pazza Licori|La finta pazza Licori]]'', to a libretto by [[Giulio Strozzi]], was completed for Fernando's successor [[Vincenzo II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua|Vincenzo II]], who succeeded to the dukedom in 1626. Because of the latter's illness (he died in 1627), it was never performed, and it is now also lost.<ref name=Arnold516 />\n\n[[File:Monteverdiletter.jpg|thumb|left|Letter from Monteverdi to Enzo Bentivoglio in Ferrara, 18 September 1627, ([[British Library]], MS Mus. 1707), discussing the composer's ''intermezzo, Didone ed Enea''<ref>See Stevens (1995), pp. 370\u201373.</ref>]]\n\nMonteverdi also received commissions from other Italian states and from their communities in Venice. These included, for the Milanese community in 1620, music for the Feast of [[St. Charles Borromeo]], and for the [[Florence|Florentine]] community a [[Requiem Mass]] for [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo II de' Medici]] (1621).<ref name=Carter3 /> Monteverdi acted on behalf of Paolo Giordano II, Duke of [[Bracciano]], to arrange publication of works by the Cremona musician Francesco Petratti.<ref>Stevens (1995), pp. 151\u201353</ref> Among Monteverdi's private Venetian patrons was the nobleman Girolamo Mocenigo, at whose home was premiered in 1624 the dramatic entertainment ''[[Il combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda]]'' based on an episode from [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[La Gerusalemme liberata]]''.<ref>Carter (2007) \"Musical sources\", p. 29</ref> In 1627 Monteverdi received a major commission from [[Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma|Odoardo Farnese]], Duke of [[Parma]], for a series of works, and gained leave from the Procurators to spend time there during 1627 and 1628.<ref name=Arnold516 />\n\nMonteverdi's musical direction received the attention of foreign visitors. The Dutch diplomat and musician [[Constantijn Huygens]], attending a Vespers service at the church of SS. Giovanni and Lucia, wrote that he \"heard the most perfect music I had ever heard in my life. It was directed by the most famous Claudio Monteverdi&nbsp;... who was also the composer and was accompanied by four [[theorbo]]s, two [[cornett]]os, two [[bassoon]]s, one ''basso de viola'' of huge size, organs and other instruments&nbsp;...\".<ref>Wistreich (2007), p. 261</ref> Monteverdi wrote a mass, and provided other musical entertainment, for the visit to Venice in 1625 of the [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw IV Vasa|Crown Prince W\u0142adys\u0142aw]] of Poland, who may have sought to revive attempts made a few years previously to lure Monteverdi to Warsaw.<ref name=Carter3 /> He also provided chamber music for [[Wolfgang Wilhelm, Count Palatine of Neuburg]], when the latter was paying an incognito visit to Venice in July 1625.<ref>Stevens (1995), p. 345</ref>\n\nCorrespondence of Monteverdi in 1625 and 1626 with the Mantuan courtier Ercole Marigliani reveals an interest in [[alchemy]], which apparently Monteverdi had taken up as a hobby. He discusses experiments to transform lead into gold, the problems of obtaining [[mercury (element)|mercury]], and mentions commissioning special vessels for his experiments from the glassworks at [[Murano]].<ref>Stevens (1995), pp. 289\u2013301</ref>\n\nDespite his generally satisfactory situation in Venice, Monteverdi experienced personal problems from time to time. He was on one occasion \u2013 probably because of his wide network of contacts \u2013 the subject of an anonymous denunciation to the Venetian authorities alleging that he supported the Habsburgs. He was also subject to anxieties about his children. His son Francesco, while a student of law at [[University of Padua|Padua]] in 1619, was spending in Monteverdi's opinion too much time with music, and he therefore moved him to the [[University of Bologna]]. This did not have the required result, and it seems that Monteverdi resigned himself to Francesco having a musical career \u2013 he joined the choir of San Marco in 1623. His other son Massimiliano, who graduated in medicine, was arrested by the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisition]] in Mantua in 1627 for reading [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|forbidden literature]]. Monteverdi was obliged to sell the necklace he had received from Duchess Caterina to pay for his son's (eventually successful) defence. Monteverdi wrote at the time to Striggio seeking his help, and fearing that Massimiliano might be subject to torture; it seems that Striggio's intervention was helpful. Money worries at this time also led Monteverdi to visit Cremona to secure for himself a church [[Canon (priest)|canonry]].<ref name=Carter3>Carter and Chew (n.d.), \u00a73 \"Venice\"</ref><ref>Stevens (1995), p. 402</ref>\n\n====Pause: 1630\u20131637====\nA series of disturbing events troubled Monteverdi's world in the period around 1630. Mantua was invaded by Habsburg armies in 1630, who besieged the [[bubonic plague|plague]]-stricken town, and after its fall in July looted its treasures, and dispersed the artistic community. The plague was carried to Mantua's ally Venice by an embassy led by Monteverdi's confidante Striggio, and over a period of 16 months led to over 45,000 deaths, leaving Venice's population in 1633 at just above 100,000, the lowest level for about 150 years. Among the plague victims was Monteverdi's assistant at San Marco, and a notable composer in his own right, [[Alessandro Grandi]]. The plague and the after-effects of war had an inevitable deleterious effect on the economy and artistic life of Venice.<ref>Norwich (1983), pp. 537\u201340</ref><ref name =Wenhamxx>Whenham (2007) \"Chronology\", p. xx</ref><ref name=Arnold617>Arnold (1980c), p. 617.</ref> Monteverdi's younger brother Giulio Cesare also died at this time, probably from the plague.<ref name = Ab534/>\n\nBy this time Monteverdi was in his sixties, and his rate of composition seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's ''[[Lost operas by Claudio Monteverdi#Proserpina rapita (1630)|Proserpina rapita]] ([[Persephone#Abduction myth|The Abduction of Proserpina]])'', now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of ''Scherzi musicali'' was published in Venice in 1632.<ref name=Carter3 /> In 1631, Monteverdi was admitted to the [[tonsure]], and was ordained [[deacon]], and later [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]], in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated as a member of the clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.<ref name=Wenhamxx /><ref name=Arnold617 />\n\n====Late flowering: 1637\u20131643====\n[[File:Frari (Venice) Cappella dei milanesi- tomb of Claudio Monteverdi.jpg|thumb|Monteverdi's tomb in the church of [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari]]]]\nThe opening of the [[Teatro San Cassiano|opera house of San Cassiano]] in 1637, the first public opera house in Europe, stimulated the city's musical life<ref name=Arnold617 /> and coincided with a new burst of the composer's activity. 1638 saw the publication of Monteverdi's eighth book of madrigals and a revision of the ''Ballo delle ingrate''. The eighth book contains a ''ballo'', \"Volgendi il ciel\", which may have been composed for the Holy Roman Emperor, [[Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand III]], to whom the book is dedicated. The years 1640\u20131641 saw the publication of the extensive collection of church music, ''[[Selva morale e spirituale]]''. Among other commissions, Monteverdi wrote music in 1637 and 1638 for Strozzi's \"Accademia degli Unisoni\" in Venice, and in 1641 a ballet, ''La vittoria d'Amore'', for the court of [[Piacenza]].<ref name = Wenhamxxi>Wenham (2007) \"Chronology\", p. xxi.</ref><ref>Arnold (1980a), p. 530</ref>\n\nMonteverdi was still not entirely free from his responsibilities for the musicians at San Marco. He wrote to complain about one of his singers to the Procurators, on 9 June 1637: \"I, Claudio Monteverdi&nbsp;... come humbly&nbsp;... to set forth to you how Domenicato Aldegati&nbsp;... a [[Bass (voice type)|bass]], yesterday morning&nbsp;... at the time of the greatest concourse of people&nbsp;... spoke these exact words&nbsp;...'The Director of Music comes from a brood of cut-throat bastards, a thieving, fucking, he-goat&nbsp;... and I shit on him and whoever protects him&nbsp;...{{' \"}}.<ref>Stevens, (1995) pp. 431\u201332</ref>{{refn|[[Denis Stevens]] notes, in his edition of Monteverdi's letters: \"Strange that these words, once unfairly applied to the composer, might now be used with some justification to describe the more unruly among his interpreters.\"<ref>Stevens (1995), p. 432, note ''k''</ref>|group=n}}\n\nMonteverdi's contribution to opera at this period is notable. He revised his earlier opera ''L'Arianna'' in 1640 and wrote three new works for the commercial stage, ''Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria (The Return of [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] to his Homeland'', 1640, first performed in Bologna with Venetian singers), ''[[Lost operas by Claudio Monteverdi#Le nozze d'Enea con Lavinia (1641\u22122)|Le nozze d'Enea e Lavinia]] (The Marriage of [[Aeneas]] and [[Lavinia]]'', 1641, music now lost), and ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]'' (''The Coronation of [[Poppea]]'', 1643).<ref>Arnold (1980a), p. 517.</ref> The introduction to the printed scenario of ''Le nozze d'Enea'', by an unknown author, acknowledges that Monteverdi is to be credited for the rebirth of theatrical music and that \"he will be sighed for in later ages, for his compositions will surely outlive the ravages of time.\"<ref>Stevens (1995), p. 434</ref>\n\nIn his last surviving letter (20 August 1643), Monteverdi, already ill, was still hoping for the settlement of the long-disputed pension from Mantua, and asked the Doge of Venice to intervene on his behalf.<ref>Stevens (1995), pp. 435\u201336</ref> He died in Venice on 29 November 1643, after paying a brief visit to Cremona, and is buried in the [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Church of the Frari]].

[[Percy Scholes]] in his ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music|Oxford Companion to Music]]'' describes the \"new music\" thus: \"[Composers] discarded the choral polyphony of the madrigal style as barbaric, and set dialogue or soliloquy for single voices, imitating more or less the inflexions of speech and accompanying the voice by playing mere supporting chords. Short choruses were interspersed, but they too were [[homophonic]] rather than polyphonic.\"<ref>Ward (ed.) (1978), p. 704</ref>\n\n===Novice years: Madrigal books 1 and 2===\n[[File:Luca conte Marenzio, Komponist des 16. Jahrhunderts.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Luca Marenzio]], an early influence on Monteverdi]]\nIngegneri, Monteverdi's first tutor, was a master of the ''[[musica reservata]]'' vocal style, which involved the use of [[chromatic]] progressions and [[word-painting]];<ref>Fabbri (2007) p. 8</ref> Monteverdi's early compositions were grounded in this style.<ref name=Carter1/> Ingegneri was a traditional Renaissance composer, \"something of an anachronism\" according to Arnold,<ref>Arnold and Fortune (1968), p. 93</ref> but Monteverdi also studied the work of more \"modern\" composers such as [[Luca Marenzio]], [[Luzzasco Luzzaschi]], and a little later,  Giaches de Wert, from whom he would learn the art of expressing passion.<ref>Arnold and Fortune (1968), p. 108</ref> He was a precocious  and productive student, as indicated by his youthful publications of 1582\u201383. [[Paul Ringer]] writes that \"these teenaged efforts reveal palpable ambition matched with a convincing mastery of contemporary style\", but at this stage they display their creator's competence rather than any striking originality.<ref name= Ringer4>Ringer (2006), p. 4</ref> [[Geoffrey Chew (musicologist)|Geoffrey Chew]] classifies them as \"not in the most modern vein for the period\", acceptable but out-of-date.<ref name= ChewEW>Carter and Chew (n.d.), \u00a77 \"Early works\"</ref> Chew rates the ''Canzonette'' collection of 1584 much more highly than the earlier juvenilia: \"These brief three-voice pieces draw on the airy, modern style of the [[villanella]]s of Marenzio, [drawing on] a substantial vocabulary of text-related madrigalisms\".<ref name= ChewEW/>\n\nThe [[canzonetta]] form was much used by composers of the day as a technical exercise, and is a prominent element in Monteverdi's first book of madrigals published in 1587. In this book, the playful, pastoral settings again reflect the style of Marenzio, while Luzzaschi's influence is evident in Monteverdi's use of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]].<ref name= ChewEW/> The second book (1590) begins with a setting modelled on Marenzio of a modern verse,  Torquato Tasso's \"Non si levav' ancor\", and concludes with a text from 50 years earlier: [[Pietro Bembo]]'s \"Cantai un tempo\". Monteverdi set the latter to music in an archaic style reminiscent of the long-dead [[Cipriano de Rore]]. Between them is \"Ecco mormorar l'onde\", strongly influenced by de Wert and hailed by Chew as the great masterpiece of the second book.<ref>Chew (2007), pp. 39\u201343</ref>\n\nA thread common throughout these early works is Monteverdi's use of the technique of ''imitatio'', a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued to use this procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.<ref>Carter and Chew (n.d.), \u00a76 \"'Imitatio' and use of models\"</ref>\n\n===Madrigals 1590\u20131605: books 3, 4, 5===\nMonteverdi's first fifteen years of service in Mantua are bracketed by his publications of the third book of Madrigals in 1592 and the fourth and fifth books in 1603 and 1605. Between 1592 and 1603 he made minor contributions to other anthologies.<ref name = Bowers58>Bowers (2007), p. 58</ref> How much he composed in this period is a matter of conjecture; his many duties in the Mantuan court may have limited his opportunities,<ref name= Ossi97>Ossi (2007), p. 97</ref> but several of the madrigals that he published in the fourth and fifth books were written and performed during the 1590s, some figuring prominently in the Artusi controversy.<ref name= ChewMantua/>\n{{listen\n | filename     = Monteverdi - non si levav'ancor.ogg\n | title        = '''Madrigal''': Non si levav'ancor from second book, pub. 1590\n | description  =\n | format       = [[Ogg]]\n | filename2     = Monteverdi-cor mio mentre vi miro.ogg\n | title2        = '''Madrigal''': Cor mio mentre vi miro from fourth book, pub. 1603\n | description2  =\n | format2       = [[Ogg]]\n }}\n\nThe third book shows strongly the increased influence of Wert,<ref name= ChewMantua>Carter and Chew (n.d.), \u00a78 \"Works from the Mantuan Years\"</ref> by that time Monteverdi's direct superior as ''maestro de capella'' at Mantua. Two poets dominate the collection: Tasso, whose lyrical poetry had figured prominently in the second book but is here represented through the more epic, heroic verses from ''[[Jerusalem Delivered|Gerusalemme liberata]]'',<ref name= Ossi98/> and [[Giovanni Battista Guarini]], whose verses had appeared sporadically in Monteverdi's earlier publications, but form around half of the contents of the third book. Wert's influence is reflected in Monteverdi's forthrightly modern approach, and his expressive and chromatic settings of Tasso's verses.<ref name= ChewMantua/> Of the Guarini settings Chew writes: \"The epigrammatic style&nbsp;... closely matches a poetic and musical ideal of the period&nbsp;... [and] often depends on strong, final cadential progressions, with or without the intensification provided by chains of suspended dissonances\". Chew cites the setting of \"Stracciami pur il core\" as \"a prime example of Monteverdi's irregular dissonance practice\".<ref name= ChewMantua/> Tasso and Guarini were both regular visitors to the Mantuan court; Monteverdi's association with them and his absorption of their ideas may have helped lay the foundations of his own approach to the musical dramas that he would create a decade later.<ref name= Ossi98>Ossi (2007), p. 98</ref>\n\nAs the 1590s progressed, Monteverdi moved closer towards the form that he would identify in due course as the ''seconda pratica''. [[Claude V. Palisca]] quotes the madrigal ''Ohim\u00e8, se tanto amate'', published in the fourth book but written before 1600 \u2013 it is among the works attacked by Artusi \u2013 as a typical example of the composer's developing powers of invention. In this madrigal Monteverdi again departs from the established practice in the use of dissonance, by means of a vocal ornament Palisca describes as ''\u00e9chapp\u00e9''. Monteverdi's daring use of this device is, says Palisca, \"like a forbidden pleasure\".<ref>Palisca (1980), pp. 10\u201311</ref> In this and in other settings the poet's images were supreme, even at the expense of musical consistency.<ref>Palisca (1980), p. 12</ref>\n\nThe fourth book includes madrigals to which Artusi objected on the grounds of their \"modernism\". However, Ossi describes it as \"an anthology of disparate works firmly rooted in the 16th century\",<ref name= Ossi102>Ossi (2007), pp. 102\u201303</ref> closer in nature to the third book than to the fifth. There is evidence of the composer's familiarity with the works of [[Carlo Gesualdo]], and with composers of the school of [[Ferrara]] such as Luzzaschi; the book was dedicated to a Ferrarese musical society, the ''Accademici Intrepidi''.<ref>Tomlinson (1990), pp. 101\u201305</ref>\n\nThe fifth book looks more to the future; for example, Monteverdi employs the ''[[concertato]]'' style with basso continuo (a device that was to become a typical feature in the emergent Baroque era), and includes a ''sinfonia'' (instrumental interlude) in the final piece. He presents his music through complex counterpoint and daring harmonies, although at times combining the expressive possibilities of the new music with traditional polyphony.<ref name= Ossi102/>\n\n===Opera and sacred music, 1607\u20131612===\n\nIn Monteverdi's final five years' service in Mantua he completed the operas ''L'Orfeo'' (1607) and ''L'Arianna'' (1608), and wrote quantities of sacred music, including the ''Messa in illo tempore'' (1610) and also the collection known as ''Vespro della Beata Vergine'' which is often referred to as \"Monteverdi's ''Vespers''\" (1610). He also published ''Scherzi musicale a tre voci'' (1607), settings of verses composed since 1599 and dedicated to the Gonzaga heir, Francesco. The vocal trio in the ''Scherzi'' comprises two sopranos and a bass, accompanied by simple instrumental [[ritornello]]s. According to Bowers the music \"reflected the modesty of the prince's resources; it was, nevertheless, the earliest publication to associate voices and instruments in this particular way\".<ref>Bowers (2007), p. 65</ref>\n\n====''L'Orfeo''====\n{{Main| L'Orfeo}}\n[[File:Frontispiece of L'Orfeo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Frontispiece of Monteverdi's opera ''L'Orfeo'', Venice edition, 1609.]]\nThe opera opens with a brief trumpet [[toccata]]. The prologue of La musica (a figure representing music) is introduced with a ritornello by the strings, repeated often to represent the \"power of music\" \u2013 one of the earliest examples of an operatic [[leitmotif]].<ref>Grout (1971), p. 56</ref> Act 1 presents a pastoral idyll, the buoyant mood of which continues into Act 2. The confusion and grief which follow the news of Euridice's death are musically reflected by harsh dissonances and the juxtaposition of keys. The music remains in this vein until the act ends with the consoling sounds of the ritornello.<ref>Ringer (2006), pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\nAct 3 is dominated by Orfeo's aria \"Possente spirto e formidabil nume\" by which he attempts to persuade [[Charon (mythology)|Caronte]] to allow him to enter Hades. Monteverdi's vocal embellishments and virtuoso accompaniment provide what Tim Carter has described as \"one of the most compelling visual and aural representations\" in early opera.<ref>Carter (1993)</ref> In Act 4 the warmth of Proserpina's singing on behalf of Orfeo is retained until Orfeo fatally \"looks back\".<ref name= H24>Harnoncourt (1969), pp. 24\u201325</ref> The brief final act, which sees Orfeo's rescue and metamorphosis, is framed by the final appearance of the ritornello and by a lively [[moresca]] that brings the audience back to their everyday world.<ref>Ringer (2006), p. 89</ref>\n\nThroughout the opera Monteverdi makes innovative use of polyphony, extending the rules beyond the conventions which composers normally observed in fidelity to [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hull|first= Robert H.|title= The Development of Harmony|url= |journal= The School Music Review|date= 15 September 1929|page=111|accessdate= }}</ref> He combines elements of the traditional 16th-century madrigal with the new monodic style where the text dominates the music and sinfonias and instrumental ritornellos illustrate the action.<ref>Ringer (2006), pp. 27\u201328</ref>\n\n====''L'Arianna''====\n{{Main|L'Arianna}}\nThe music for this opera is lost except for the ''Lamento d'Arianna'', which was published in the sixth book in 1614 as a five-voice madrigal; a separate monodic version was published in 1623.<ref>Whenham (2007) \"Catalogue and Index\", p. 322</ref> In its operatic context the lament depicts Arianna's various emotional reactions to her abandonment: sorrow, anger, fear, self-pity, desolation and a sense of futility. Throughout, indignation and anger are punctuated by tenderness, until a descending line brings the piece to a quiet conclusion.<ref name= R96/>\n\nThe musicologist Suzanne Cusick writes that Monteverdi \"creat[ed] the lament as a recognizable genre of vocal chamber music and as a standard scene in opera&nbsp;... that would become crucial, almost genre-defining, to the full-scale public operas of 17th-century Venice\".<ref name=Cusick>Cusick (1984)</ref> Cusick observes how Monteverdi is able to match in music the \"rhetorical and syntactical gestures\" in the text of  Ottavio Rinuccini.<ref name= Cusick/> The opening repeated words \"Lasciatemi morire\" (Let me die) are accompanied by a [[dominant seventh chord]] which Ringer describes as \"an unforgettable chromatic stab of pain\".<ref name= R96/> Ringer suggests that the lament defines Monteverdi's innovative creativity in a manner similar to that in which the Prelude and the [[Liebestod]] in ''[[Tristan und Isolde]]'' announced [[Richard Wagner|Wagner's]] discovery of new expressive frontiers.<ref name= R96>Ringer (2006), pp. 96\u201398</ref>\n\nRinuccini's full libretto, which has survived, was set in modern times by [[Alexander Goehr]] (''[[Arianna (Goehr)|Arianna]]'', 1995), including a version of Monteverdi's ''Lament''.<ref>Sutcliffe (1995), pp. 610\u201311</ref>\n\n====Vespers====\n{{Main|Vespro della Beata Vergine}}\n{{listen |filename= Deus in adiutorium.ogg |title= ''Deus in adiutorium'', from ''Vespro della Beata Vergine'' |description= |format= [[Ogg]] |filename2= Laudate pueri.ogg |title2= ''Laudate pueri'', from ''Vespro della Beata Vergine'' |description2= |format2= [[Ogg]]}}\nThe ''Vespro della Beata Vergine'', Monteverdi's first published sacred music since the ''Madrigali spirituali'' of 1583, consists of 14 components: an introductory versicle and response, five psalms interspersed with five \"sacred concertos\" (Monteverdi's term),<ref name= W17>Whenham (1997), pp. 16\u201317</ref> a hymn, and two Magnificat settings. Collectively these pieces fulfil the requirements for a  Vespers  service on any [[Marian feast days|feast day of the Virgin]]. Monteverdi employs many musical styles; the more traditional features, such as [[cantus firmus]], [[falsobordone]] and Venetian [[canzone]], are mixed with the latest madrigal style, including echo effects and chains of dissonances. Some of the musical features used are reminiscent of ''L'Orfeo'', written slightly earlier for similar instrumental and vocal forces.<ref name= ChewMantua/>\n\nIn this work the \"sacred concertos\" fulfil the role of the [[antiphons]] which divide the psalms in regular Vespers services. Their non-liturgical character has led writers to question whether they should be within the service, or indeed whether this was Monteverdi's intention. In some versions of Monteverdi's ''Vespers'' (for example, those of [[Denis Stevens]]) the concertos are replaced with antiphons associated with the Virgin, although [[John Whenham]] in his analysis of the work argues that the collection as a whole should be regarded as a single liturgical and artistic entity.<ref name= W17/>\n\nAll the psalms, and the Magnificat, are based on melodically limited and repetitious [[Gregorian chant]] psalm tones, around which Monteverdi builds a range of innovative textures. This concertato style challenges the traditional  cantus firmus,<ref name= K2007>Kurtzman 2007, pp. 147\u201353</ref> and is most evident in the \"Sonata sopra Sancta Maria\", written for eight string and wind instruments plus basso continuo, and a single soprano voice. Monteverdi uses modern rhythms, frequent metre changes and constantly varying textures;<ref name= K2007/> yet, according to [[John Eliot Gardiner]], \"for all the virtuosity of its instrumental writing and the evident care which has gone into the combinations of timbre\", Monteverdi's chief concern was resolving the proper combination of words and music.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes\n| title       = Claudio Monteverdi: Vespro della beata vergine\n| title-link  =\n| others      =\n| year        = 1990\n| chapter     =\n| url         =\n| last        = Gardiner\n| first       = John Eliot\n| author-link = John Eliot Gardiner\n| first2      =\n| last2       =\n| author-link2 =\n| page        =\n| pages       = 17\u201322\n| at          =\n| type        =\n| publisher   = Deutsche Grammophon\n| id          = Digital stereo 429 565\u20132\n| location    = Hamburg\n| ref         =\n}}</ref>\n\nThe actual musical ingredients of the Vespers were not novel to Mantua \u2013 concertato had been used by [[Lodovico Grossi da Viadana]],<ref name= AF123/> a former choirmaster at the cathedral of Mantua,<ref>Mompellio (n.d.)</ref> while the ''Sonata sopra'' had been anticipated by [[Archangelo Crotti]] in his ''Sancta Maria'' published in 1608. It is, writes [[Denis Arnold]], Monteverdi's mixture of the various elements that makes the music unique.

The sixth book consists of works written before the composer's departure from Mantua.<ref name= ChewVenice/> [[Hans Redlich]] sees it as a transitional work, containing Monteverdi's last madrigal compositions in the manner of the ''prima pratica'', together with music which is typical of the new style of expression which Monteverdi had displayed in the dramatic works of 1607\u201308.<ref>Redlich (1952), p. 76</ref> The central theme of the collection is loss; the best-known work is the five-voice version of ''Lamento d'Arianna'', which, says Massimo Ossi, gives \"an object lesson in the close relationship between monodic recitative and counterpoint\".<ref name= Ossi107>Ossi (2007), pp. 107\u201308</ref> The book contains Monteverdi's first settings of verses by [[Giambattista Marino]], and two settings of [[Petrarch]] which Ossi considers the most extraordinary pieces in the volume, providing some \"stunning musical moments\".<ref name= Ossi107/>\n\n====Seventh book====\nWhile Monteverdi had looked backwards in the sixth book, he moved forward in the seventh book from the traditional concept of the madrigal, and from monody, in favour of chamber duets.

For unknown reasons, the composer's name does not appear on the inscription, the dedication being signed by the Venetian printer Bartolemeo Magni; Carter surmises that the recently ordained Monteverdi may have wished to keep his distance from this secular collection.<ref name= Carter183/> It mixes strophic continuo songs for solo voice with more complex works which employ continuous variation over repeated bass patterns. Chew selects the [[chaconne]] for two tenors, ''Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti'', as the outstanding item in the collection: \"[T]he greater part of this piece consists of repetitions of a bass pattern which ensures tonal unity of a simple kind, owing to its being framed as a simple cadence in a G major tonal type: over these repetitions, inventive variations unfold in virtuoso passage-work\".<ref name= ChewVenice/>\n\n=== Late operas and final works ===\n''Main articles'': ''[[Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria]]''; ''[[L'incoronazione di Poppea]]''; ''[[Selva morale e spirituale]]''\n[[File:Poppea Sabina.jpg|thumb|upright|Poppea, represented in a 16th-century painting]]\nThe last years of Monteverdi's life were much occupied with opera for the Venetian stage. [[Richard Taruskin]], in his ''[[Oxford History of Western Music]]'', gives his chapter on this topic the title \"Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi.\" This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian [[Nino Pirrotta]], is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for the transformation of the opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with ''Orfeo'' in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera ''L'incoronazione di Poppea'' (1643).<ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 1\u20132</ref> His two surviving operatic works of this period, ''Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria'' and ''L'incoronazione'' are held by Arnold to be the first \"modern\" operas;<ref name= ArnoldBrit>{{cite web|authorlink= Denis Arnold|last= Arnold|first= Denis|title= Claudio Monteverdi: Three decades in Venice|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/390820/Claudio-Monteverdi/4981/Three-decades-in-Venice|publisher= Britannica Online|accessdate= 21 February 2010}}</ref> ''Il ritorno'' is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms \"the mythological pastoral\".<ref>Rosand (2007), p. 230</ref> However, David Johnson in ''The North American Review'' warns audiences not to expect immediate affinity with [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] or [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]]: \"You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last= Johnson|first= David|title= For the Record|jstor= 25116167|journal= The North American Review|volume= 250|issue= 2|date= May 1965|page= 63}} {{subscription}}</ref>\n\n''Il ritorno'', says Carter, is clearly influenced by Monteverdi's earlier works. Penelope's lament in Act I is close in character to the lament from ''L'Arianna'', while the martial episodes recall ''Il combattimento''. ''Stile concitato'' is prominent in the fight scenes and in the slaying of [[Suitors of Penelope|Penelope's suitors]]. In ''L'incoronazione'', Monteverdi represents moods and situations by specific musical devices: triple metre stands for the language of love; arpeggios demonstrate conflict; ''stile concitato'' represents rage.<ref>Carter (2002), p. 250</ref> There is continuing debate about how much of the extant ''L'incoronazione'' music is Monteverdi's original, and how much is the work of others (there are, for instance, traces of music by Francesco Cavalli).<ref name=Cavalli /><ref>Rosand (1991), p. 220</ref>\n\nThe ''Selva morale e spirituale'' of 1641, and the posthumous ''Messa et salmi'' published in 1650 (which was edited by Cavalli), are selections of the sacred music that Monteverdi wrote for San Marco during his 30-year tenure \u2013 much else was likely written but not published.<ref name=Cavalli /><ref name= Guardian>{{cite newspaper|url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/24/monteverdi-messa-quattro-voci-salmi-1650-cd-review-the-sixteen|last= Clements|first= Andrew|title= Monteverdi: Messa a Quattro Voci et Salmi of 1650: CD review|newspaper= The Guardian|date= 24 March 2016|accessdate= 15 July 2017}}</ref> The ''Selva morale'' volume opens with a series of madrigal settings on moral texts, dwelling on themes such as \"the transitory nature of love, earthly rank and achievement, even existence itself\".<ref>Whenham (2007) \"The Venetian Sacred Music\", p. 204</ref> They are followed by a Mass in conservative style (''[[stile antico]]''), the high point of which is an extended seven-voice \"Gloria\".

This is evidenced by the scale of his funeral rites: \"[W]ith truly royal pomp a [[catafalque]] was erected in the Chiesa de Padrini Minori de Frari, decorated all in mourning, but surrounded with so many candles that the church resembled a night sky luminous with stars\".<ref>Ringer (2006), p. 308</ref> This glorification was transitory; Carter writes that in Monteverdi's day, music rarely survived beyond the circumstances of its initial performance and was quickly forgotten along with its creator.<ref name= C4>Carter (2002), p. 4</ref> In this regard Monteverdi fared better than most. His operatic works were revived in several cities in the decade following his death;<ref name= R145>Redlich (1952), pp. 145\u201348</ref> according to Severo Bonini writing in 1651, every musical household in Italy possessed a copy of the ''Lamento d'Arianna''.<ref>Pryer (2007), p. 15</ref>\n\nThe German composer [[Heinrich Sch\u00fctz]], who had studied in Venice under [[Giovanni Gabrieli]] shortly before Monteverdi's arrival there, possessed a copy of ''Il combattimento'' and himself took up elements of the \"stile concitato\". On his second visit to Venice in 1628\u20131629, Arnold believes, Sch\u00fctz absorbed the concepts of ''basso continuo'' and expressiveness of word-setting, but he opines that Sch\u00fctz was more directly influenced by the style of the younger generation of Venetian composers, including Grandi and [[Giovanni Rovetta]] (the eventual successor to Monteverdi at San Marco).<ref>Arnold (1985), pp. 359, 362\u201365, 367\u201374</ref> Sch\u00fctz published a first book of [[Symphoniae sacrae I|Symphonia sacrae]], settings of biblical texts in the style of ''seconda pratica'', in Venice in 1629. ''Es steh Gott auf'', from his Symphoniae sacrae II, published in Dresden in 1647, contains specific quotations from Monteverdi.<ref>Drebes (1992), p. 54</ref>\n\nAfter the 1650s, Monteverdi's name quickly disappears from contemporary accounts, his music generally forgotten except for the ''Lamento'', prototype of a genre that would endure well into the 18th century.<ref name= R145/>\n\n[[File:D.annunzio c. 1904.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The writer [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]], an early 20th-century admirer of Monteverdi]]\nInterest in Monteverdi revived in the late 18th and early 19th centuries among music scholars in Germany and Italy, although he was still regarded as essentially a historical curiosity.<ref name= C4/> Wider interest in the music itself began in 1881, when [[Robert Eitner]] published a shortened version of the ''Orfeo'' score.<ref>Fortune (1986), pp. 80\u201381</ref> Around this time [[Kurt Vogel (musicologist)|Kurt Vogel]] scored the madrigals from the original manuscripts, but more critical interest was shown in the operas, following the discovery of the ''L'incoronazione'' manuscript in 1888 and that of ''Il ritorno'' in 1904.<ref>Redlich (1952), p. 146</ref> Largely through the efforts of [[Vincent d'Indy]], all three operas were staged in one form or other, during the first quarter of the 20th century: ''L'Orfeo'' in May 1911,<ref>Fortune and Whenham (1986), pp. 173\u201381</ref> ''L'incoronazione'' in February 1913 and ''Il ritorno'' in May 1925.<ref>Carter (2002), p. 6</ref>\n\nThe [[Italian nationalism#Post-Risorgimento, World War I and aftermath (1870 to 1922)|Italian nationalist]] poet [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] lauded Monteverdi and in his novel ''Il fuoco'' (1900) wrote of \"''il divino Claudio''&nbsp;... what a heroic soul, purely Italian in its essence!\" His vision of Monteverdi as the true founder of Italian musical lyricism was adopted by musicians who worked with the regime of [[Benito Mussolini]] (1922\u20131945), including [[Francesco Malipiero]], [[Luigi Dallapiccola]], and Mario Labroca, who contrasted Monteverdi with the decadence of the music of [[Richard Strauss]], [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].<ref>dell'Antonio (1996), pp. 272, 274\u201375, 278\u201380</ref>\n\nIn the years after the Second World War the operas began to be performed in the major opera houses, and eventually were established in the general repertory.<ref>Abbate and Parker (2012), p. 54</ref> The resuscitation of Monteverdi's sacred music took longer; he did not benefit from the Catholic Church's 19th-century revival of Renaissance music in the way that Palestrina did, perhaps, as Carter suggests, because Monteverdi was viewed chiefly as a secular composer.<ref name= C4/> It was not until 1932 that the 1610 ''Vespers'' were published in a modern edition, followed by Redlich's revision two years later.

Thus, says Chew, \"his achievement was both retrospective and progressive\".

It did this by combining the [[plaintext]] characters with a stream of [[Key (cryptography)|key]] characters using the [[XOR]] [[Boolean function]] to produce the [[ciphertext]].\n\nIn August 1941, a blunder by German operators led to the transmission of two versions of the same message with identical machine settings. These were intercepted and worked on at Bletchley Park. First, [[John Tiltman]], a very talented GC&CS cryptanalyst, derived a [[key stream]] of almost 4000 characters.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Budianski, Stephen ''Colossus, Codebreaking and the Digital Age'' pp. 55\u201356}} Then [[Bill Tutte]], a newly arrived member of the Research Section, used this key stream to work out the logical structure of the Lorenz machine. He deduced that the twelve wheels consisted of two groups of five, which he named the \u03c7 (''[[chi (letter)|chi]]'') and \u03c8 (''[[psi (letter)|psi]]'') wheels, the remaining two he called \u03bc (''[[Mu (letter)|mu]]'') or \"motor\" wheels. The ''chi'' wheels stepped regularly with each letter that was encrypted, while the ''psi'' wheels stepped irregularly, under the control of the motor wheels.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Tutte, William T. ''My Work at Bletchley Park'' p. 357}}\n\nWith a sufficiently random key stream, a Vernam cipher removes the natural language property of a plaintext message of having an uneven [[frequency distribution]] of the different characters, to produce a uniform distribution in the ciphertext. The Tunny machine did this well. However, the cryptanalysts worked out that by examining the frequency distribution of the character-to-character changes in the ciphertext, instead of the plain characters, there was a departure from uniformity which provided a way into the system. This was achieved by [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#Differencing|\"differencing\"]] in which each bit or character was XOR-ed with its successor.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11C Wheel Patterns, (b) Differenced and Undifferenced Wheels, p. 11}} After Germany surrendered, allied forces captured a Tunny machine and discovered that it was the [[electromechanical]] [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ]] (''Schl\u00fcsselzusatzger\u00e4t'', cipher attachment) in-line cipher machine.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11A Fish Machines, (c) The German Ciphered Teleprinter, p. 4}}\n\n[[File:Lorenz SZ40 cipher machine (TUNNY) - National Cryptologic Museum - DSC07883.JPG|right|upright=1.35|thumbnail|A Lorenz SZ40 machine on display at the National Cryptologic Museum, Fort Meade, Maryland, USA.]]\n\nIn order to decrypt the transmitted messages, two tasks had to be performed. The first was \"wheel breaking\", which was the discovery of the cam patterns for all the wheels. These patterns were set up on the Lorenz machine and then used for a fixed period of time for a succession of different messages. Each transmission, which often contained more than one message, was enciphered with a different start position of the wheels. Alan Turing invented a method of wheel-breaking that became known as [[Turingery]].{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, ''Turingery'' pp. 378\u2013385}} Turing's technique was further developed into \"Rectangling\", for which Colossus could produce tables for manual analysis. Colossi 2, 4, 6, 7 and 9 had a \"gadget\" to aid this process.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 24 \u2013 Rectangling: 24B Making and Entering Rectangles pp. 114\u2013115, 119\u2013120}}\n\nThe second task was [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher#Steps in Wheel Setting|\"wheel setting\"]], which worked out the start positions of the wheels for a particular message, and could only be attempted once the cam patterns were known.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11E The Tunny Network, (b) Wheel-breaking and Setting, p. 15}} It was this task for which Colossus was initially designed. To discover the start position of the ''chi'' wheels for a message, Colossus compared two character streams, counting statistics from the evaluation of programmable Boolean functions. The two streams were the ciphertext, which was read at high speed from a paper tape, and the key stream, which was generated internally, in a  simulation of the unknown German machine. After a succession of different Colossus runs to discover the likely ''chi''-wheel settings, they were checked by examining the frequency distribution of the characters in processed ciphertext.{{sfn|Small|1944|p=15}} Colossus produced these frequency counts.\n\n==Decryption processes==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" | border=1 | align=\"right\" | style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|+ Notation {{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 12 Cryptographic Aspects, 12A The Problem, (a) Formulae and Notation, p. 16}}\n|-\n| <big>P</big> || plaintext\n|-\n| <big>K</big> || key \u2013 the sequence of characters used in binary [[XOR]] with <br /> the plaintext to give the ciphertext\n|-\n| <big><math>\\chi</math></big> ||''chi'' component of key\n|-\n| <big><math>\\psi</math></big> ||''psi'' component of key\n|-\n| <big><math>\\psi'</math></big> ||extended ''psi'' \u2013 the actual sequence of characters added by <br /> the ''psi'' wheels, including those when they do not advance {{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11B The Tunny Cipher Machine, (e) Psi-key, p. 7}}\n|-\n| <big>Z</big> || ciphertext\n|-\n| <big>D</big> || de-''chi''\u2014the ciphertext with the ''chi'' component of the key removed{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 12 Cryptographic Aspects, 12A The Problem, (a) Formulae and Notation, p. 16}}\n|-\n| <big>\u0394</big> || any of the above XOR'ed with its successor character or bit{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11C Wheel Patterns, (b) Differenced and Undifferenced Wheels, p. 11}}\n|-\n| <big>\u2295</big> || the XOR operation<ref>The [[Truth function|Boolean or \"truth\" function]] [[Exclusive or|XOR]], also known as [[Exclusive disjunction|Exclusive disjunction and Exclusive or]], is the same as binary [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 2 addition and subtraction</ref>{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 1 Introduction: 11 German Tunny, 11B The Tunny Cipher Machine, (a) Addition, p. 5}}\n|-\n| '''\u2022''' || Bletchley Park shorthand for telegraphy code ''space'' (zero)\n|-\n| '''x''' || Bletchley Park shorthand for telegraphy code ''mark'' (one)\n|-\n|}\nBy using differencing and knowing that the ''psi'' wheels did not advance with each character, Tutte worked out that trying just two differenced bits (impulses) of the ''chi''-stream against the differenced ciphertext would produce a statistic that was non-random.

If this number exceeded a pre-defined threshold value known as the \"set total\", it was printed out. The cryptanalyst would examine the printout to determine which of the putative start positions was most likely to be the correct one for the ''chi''-1 and ''chi''-2 wheels.{{sfn|Carter|2008|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nThis technique would then be applied to other pairs of, or single, impulses to determine the likely start position of all five ''chi'' wheels. From this, the de-''chi'' (D) of a ciphertext could be obtained, from which the ''psi'' component could be removed by manual methods.{{sfn|Small|1944|p=65}} If the frequency distribution of characters in the de-''chi'' version of the ciphertext was within certain bounds, \"wheel setting\" of the ''chi'' wheels was considered to have been achieved,{{sfn|Small|1944|p=15}} and the message settings and de-''chi'' were passed to the \"[[Testery]]\". This was the section at Bletchley Park led by Major [[Ralph Tester]] where the bulk of the decrypting work was done by manual and linguistic methods.{{sfn|Roberts|2009|loc=34 minutes in}}\n\nColossus could also derive the start position of the ''psi'' and motor wheels, but this was not much done until the last few months of the war, when there were plenty of Colossi available and the number of Tunny messages had declined.\n\n==Design and construction==\nColossus was developed for the \"[[Newmanry]]\",{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 3 Organisation: 31 Mr Newman's section, p. 276}} the section headed by the mathematician [[Max Newman]] that was responsible for machine methods against the twelve-rotor [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ40/42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine]] (code named Tunny, for tunafish). The Colossus design arose out of a prior project that produced a counting machine dubbed \"[[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]\". Although it proved the concept of machine analysis for this part of the process, it was initially unreliable. The electro-mechanical parts were relatively slow and it was difficult to synchronise two looped [[punched tape|paper tapes]], one containing the enciphered message, and the other representing part of the key stream of the Lorenz machine,{{sfn|Anderson|2007|p=8}} also the tapes tended to stretch when being read at up to 2000 characters per second.\n[[File:COLOSSUS, part of the machine, presented by Director GCHQ to Director NSA in 1986 - National Cryptologic Museum - DSC07890.JPG|thumbnail|upright=1.15|[[Stepping switch]] from an original Colossus presented by the Director of [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]] to the Director of the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to mark the 40th anniversary of the [[UKUSA Agreement]] in 1986<ref>Exhibit in the National Cryptologic Museum, Fort Meade, Maryland, USA</ref>]]\n\nTommy Flowers [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]<ref>Flowers had been appointed MBE in June 1943</ref> was a senior electrical engineer and Head of the Switching Group at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]].

''Colossus'' p. 96}} He presented this design to Max Newman in February 1943, but the idea that the one to two thousand thermionic valves ([[vacuum tube]]s and [[thyratron]]s) proposed, could work together reliably, was greeted with great scepticism,{{sfn|Flowers|1983|p=244}} so more Robinsons were ordered from Dollis Hill. Flowers, however, knew from his pre-war work that most thermionic valve failures occurred as a result of the thermal stresses at power up, so not powering a machine down reduced failure rates to very low levels.{{sfn|Copeland|2006|loc=Copeland, Jack, ''Machine against Machine'' p. 72}} Additionally, the heaters were started at a low voltage then slowly brought up to full voltage to reduce the thermal stress.

The operator would then thread the paper tape through the gate and around the pulleys of the bedstead and adjust the tension. The two-tape bedstead design had been carried on from Heath Robinson so that one tape could be loaded whilst the previous one was being run. A switch on the Selection Panel specified the \"near\" or the \"far\" tape.{{sfn|Fensom|2006|p=303}}\n\nAfter performing various resetting and zeroizing tasks, the Wren operators would, under instruction from the cryptanalyst, operate the \"set total\" decade switches and the K2 panel switches to set the desired algorithm.

I told the machine to make certain calculations and counts, and after studying the results, told it to do another job. It did not remember the previous result, nor could it have acted upon it if it did. Colossus and I alternated in an interaction that sometimes achieved an analysis of an unusual German cipher system, called \"Geheimschreiber\" by the Germans, and \"Fish\" by the cryptanalysts.{{sfn|Flowers|1983|pp=239\u2013252}} }}\n\nColossus was not a [[stored-program computer]]. The input data for the five parallel processors was read from the looped message paper tape and the electronic pattern generators for the ''chi'', ''psi'' and motor wheels.{{sfn|Small|1944|p=108}} The programs for the processors were set and held on the switches and jack panel connections. Each processor could evaluate a Boolean function and count and display the number of times it yielded the specified value of \"false\" (0) or \"true\" (1) for each pass of the message tape.\n\nInput to the processors came from two sources, the shift registers from tape reading and the thyratron rings that emulated the wheels of the Tunny machine.{{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 5 Machines: 53 Colossus, pp. 333\u2013353}} The characters on the paper tape were called '''Z''' and the characters from the Tunny emulator were referred to by the Greek letters that Bill Tutte had given them when working out the logical structure of the machine. On the selection panel, switches specified either '''Z''' or '''\u0394Z''', either <math>\\chi</math> or '''\u0394'''<math>\\chi</math> and either <math>\\psi</math> or '''\u0394'''<math>\\psi</math> for the data to be passed to the jack field and 'K2 switch panel'. These signals from the wheel simulators could be specified as stepping on with each new pass of the message tape or not.\n\nThe K2 switch panel had a group of switches on the left hand side to specify the algorithm. The switches on the right hand side selected the counter to which the result was fed. The plugboard allowed less specialized conditions to be imposed. Overall the K2 switch panel switches and the plugboard allowed about five billion different combinations of the selected variables. {{sfn|Good|Michie|Timms|1945|loc = 5 Machines: 53 Colossus 53A Introduction, p.333}}\n\nAs an example: a set of runs for a message tape might initially involve two ''chi'' wheels, as in Tutte's 1+2 algorithm. Such a two-wheel run was called a long run, taking on average eight minutes unless the parallelism was utilised to cut the time by a factor of five. The subsequent runs might only involve setting one ''chi'' wheel, giving a short run taking about two minutes. Initially, after the initial long run, the choice of next algorithm to be tried was specified by the cryptanalyst. Experience showed, however, that decision trees for this iterative process could be produced for use by the Wren operators in a proportion of cases.{{sfn|Budiansky|2006|p=62}}\n\n==Influence and fate==\nAlthough the Colossus was the first of the electronic digital machines with programmability, albeit limited by modern standards,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/BriefHistofComp.html#Col|title=A Brief History of Computing.

In 1972 [[Herman Goldstine]], who was unaware of Colossus and its legacy to the projects of people such as Alan Turing ([[ACE (computer)|ACE]]), Max Newman ([[Manchester computers]]) and [[Harry Huskey]] ([[Bendix G-15]]), wrote that,\n\n{{quote|Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field.{{sfn|Goldstine|1980|p=321}} }}\n\nProfessor [[Brian Randell]], who unearthed information about Colossus in the 1970s, commented on this, saying that:\n{{quote|It is my opinion that the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer.{{sfn|Randell|1980|p=87}} }}\n\nRandell's efforts started to bear fruit in the mid-1970s, after the secrecy about Bletchley Park was broken when Group Captain Winterbotham published his 1974 book ''The Ultra Secret''.<ref>{{Citation | last = Winterbotham | first = F.W. | author-link = F.W.

Published and distributed independently of the established comics industry, most of such comics reflected the youth [[counterculture]] and [[drug culture]] of the time. Many had an uninhibited, often irreverent style; their frank depictions of nudity, sex, profanity, and politics had no parallel outside their precursors, the pornographic and even more obscure \"[[Tijuana bibles]]\". Underground comics were almost never sold at newsstands, but rather in such youth-oriented outlets as [[head shops]] and record stores, as well as by [[mail order]].\n\n[[Frank Stack]]'s ''The Adventures of Jesus'', published under the name Foolbert Sturgeon,<ref name=\"Shelton\">{{Cite book | last1=Stack | first1=Frank | authorlink1=Frank Stack | last2=Shelton | first2=Gilbert | authorlink2=Gilbert Shelton | title=The New Adventures of Jesus | date=25 December 2006 | publisher=[[Fantagraphics Books]] | page=9 | chapter=Introduction | isbn=978-1-56097-780-3}}</ref><ref name=\"Skinn-34\"/> has been credited as the first underground comic;<ref name=\"Shelton\"/><ref name=\"Skinn-34\">{{Cite book | last=Skinn | first=Dez | authorlink=Dez Skinn | title=Comix: The Underground Revolution | date=20 May 2004 | publisher=[[Thunder's Mouth Press]] | page=34 | chapter=Heroes of the Revolution | isbn=978-1-56025-572-7}}</ref> while [[R.

Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre, but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"[[small press]]\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers - such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] - had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"[[minicomic]]s\" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref> despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].\n\n===Graphic novels===\n[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]\n{{Main|Graphic novel}}\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger.

Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way, and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the number 1 issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974. The \"Pay Copy\" of this book sold for $43,125 in a 2005 [[Heritage Auctions|Heritage]] auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://comics.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=818&Lot_No=2020&type=prte-pr091305a |title=Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1 Pay Copy (First Funnies, Inc., 1939) CGC VF/NM 9.0 Cream to off-white pages.

(See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in a thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. {{as of|2014||}}, there are two companies that provide third party grading of comic book condition. Because condition is so important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as [http://comics.gocollect.com GoCollect] and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-man are considered priceless.\n\n==Asian comics==\n\n===Japanese manga===\n{{Main|Manga}}\n\nThe first comic books in Japan appeared during the 18th century in the form of woodblock-printed booklets containing short stories drawn from folk tales, legends, and historical accounts, told in a simple visual-verbal idiom. Known as {{Nihongo|\"red books\"|\u8d64\u672c|akahon}}, {{Nihongo|\"black books\"|\u9ed2\u672c|kurobon}}, and {{Nihongo|\"blue books\"|\u9752\u672c|aohon}}, these were written primarily for less literate readers. However, with the publication in 1775 of Koikawa Harumachi's comic book {{Nihongo|''Master Flashgold's Splendiferous Dream''|\u91d1\u3005\u5148\u751f\u6804\u82b1\u306e\u5922|Kinkin sensei eiga no yume}}, an evolved form of comic book originated, which required greater literacy and cultural sophistication. This was known as the {{nihongo3|lit. ''yellow cover''|\u9ec4\u8868\u7d19|[[kiby\u014dshi]]}}. Published in thousands of copies, the ''kiby\u014dshi'' may have been the earliest fully realized comic book for adults in world literary history. Approximately 2,000 titles remain [[Extant literature|extant]].\n\nModern comic books in Japan developed from a mixture of these earlier comic books and of woodblock prints {{Nihongo|''[[ukiyo-e]]''|\u6d6e\u4e16\u7d75|}} with Western styles of drawing. They took their current form shortly after World War II. They are usually published in black-and-white, except for the covers, which are usually printed in four colors, although occasionally, the first few pages may also be printed in full color. The term ''manga'' means \"random (or whimsical) pictures\", and first came into common usage in the late 18th century with the publication of such works as [[Sant\u014d Ky\u014dden]]'s picturebook {{Nihongo|''Shiji no yukikai''|\u56db\u6642\u4ea4\u52a0|}} (1798) and Aikawa Minwa's ''Comic Sketches of a Hundred Women'' (1798). During the [[Meiji period]], the term ''[[Akahon]]'' was also common.\n\nWestern artists were brought over to teach their students such concepts as line, form, and color; these were things which had not been regarded as conceptually important in ''ukiyo-e'', as the idea behind the picture was of paramount importance. Manga at this time was referred to as ''Ponchi-e'' (Punch-picture) and, like its British counterpart ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine, mainly depicted humor and political satire in short one- or [[Yonkoma|four-picture format]].\n\nDr. [[Osamu Tezuka]] (1928\u20131989) further developed this form. Seeing an animated war propaganda film titled {{Nihongo|''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]''|\u6843\u592a\u90ce\u3000\u6d77\u306e\u795e\u5175|''Momotar\u014d Umi no Shinpei''}} inspired Tezuka to become a comic artist. He introduced episodic storytelling and character development in comic format, in which each story is part of larger story arc. The only text in Tezuka's comics was the characters' dialogue and this further lent his comics a cinematic quality. Inspired by the work of Walt Disney, Tezuka also adopted a style of drawing facial features in which a character's [[human eye|eye]]s, [[human nose|nose]], and mouth are drawn in an extremely exaggerated manner. This style created immediately recognizable expressions using very few lines, and the simplicity of this style allowed Tezuka to be prolific. Tezuka's work generated new interest in the ''ukiyo-e'' tradition, in which the image is a representation of an idea, rather than a depiction of reality.\n\nThough a close equivalent to the American comic book, manga has historically held a more important place in Japanese culture than comics have in American culture. Japanese society shows a wide respect for manga, both as an art form and as a form of popular literature. Many manga become television shows or short films. As with its American counterpart, some manga has been criticized for its sexuality and violence, although in the absence of official or even industry restrictions on content, artists have freely created manga for every age group and for every topic.\n\nManga magazines\u2014also known as [[comics anthology|\"anthologies\"]]\u2014often run several series concurrently, with approximately 20 to 40 pages allocated to each series per issue. These magazines range from 200 to more than 850 pages each. Manga magazines also contain [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics and a variety of four-panel yonkoma (equivalent to comic strips). Manga series may continue for [[List of manga series by volume count|many years]] if they are successful, with stories often collected and reprinted in book-sized volumes called {{nihongo3|lit. ''stand-alone book''|\u5358\u884c\u672c|[[tank\u014dbon]]}}, the equivalent of the American [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]. These volumes use higher-quality paper and are useful to readers who want to be brought up to date with a series, or to readers who find the cost of the weekly or monthly publications to be prohibitive. Deluxe versions are printed as commemorative or collectible editions.\n\n===D\u014djinshi===\n{{Main|D\u014djinshi}}\n\n{{nihongo3|''fan magazine''|\u540c\u4eba\u8a8c|D\u014djinshi}}, [[fan-made]] Japanese comics, operate in a far larger market in Japan than the American \"underground comics\" market; the largest d\u014djinshi fair, [[Comiket]], attracts 500,000 visitors twice a year.<ref>Mizoguchi Akiko (2003). \"Male-Male Romance by and for Women in Japan: A History and the Subgenres of Yaoi Fictions\".

The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunt the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\n===Webtoons===\n{{Main|Webtoons}}\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwaga]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include Lezhin, Naver, and Kakao.\n\n===Chinese manhua===\n{{Main|Manhua}}\n\n==European comics==\n{{Main|European comics}}\n\n===Franco-Belgian comics===\n\n{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] (1926 \u2013 1977), writer of the ''[[Ast\u00e9rix]]'' comic book series.]] \nFrance and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessin\u00e9es'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics, but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvi\u00e8me art'' (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\n===British comics===\n{{Main|British comics}}\n\n[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|right|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.<ref>Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), \"Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero\", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished. Some comics, such as ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' and other ''2000 AD'' titles, have been published in a [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] form. Underground comics and [[British small press comics|\"small press\"]] titles have also appeared in the UK, notably ''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' and ''[[Escape Magazine]]''.\n\nThe content of ''[[Action (comic)|Action]]'', another title aimed at children and launched in the mid-1970s, became the subject of discussion in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the U.S., such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the U.S. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972. DC Comics and [[Dark Horse Comics]] also opened offices in the 1990s.

Author comics are published in the French BD format, with an example being Pratt's ''[[Corto Maltese]]''.\n\nItalian cartoonists show the influence of comics from other countries, including France, Belgium, Spain, and [[Argentina]].

Connectedness is one of the principal [[topological properties]] that are used to distinguish topological spaces.\n\nA subset of a topological space ''X'' is a '''connected set''' if it is a connected space when viewed as a [[Subspace topology|subspace]] of ''X''.\n\n==Formal definition==\nA [[topological space]] ''X'' is said to be '''disconnected''' if it is the [[union (set theory)|union]] of two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[nonempty]] [[open set]]s. Otherwise, ''X'' is said to be '''connected'''.  A [[subset]] of a topological space is said to be connected if it is connected under its subspace topology. Some authors exclude the [[empty set]] (with its unique topology) as a connected space, but this article does not follow that practice.\n\nFor a topological space ''X'' the following conditions are equivalent:\n\n#''X'' is connected, that is, it cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty open sets.\n#''X'' cannot be divided into two disjoint nonempty [[closed set]]s.\n#The only subsets of ''X'' which are both open and closed ([[clopen set]]s) are ''X'' and the empty set.\n#The only subsets of ''X'' with empty [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] are ''X'' and the empty set.\n#''X'' cannot be written as the union of two nonempty [[separated sets]] (sets for which each is disjoint from the other's closure). \n#All continuous functions from ''X'' to {0,1} are constant, where {0,1} is the two-point space endowed with the discrete topology.\n\n===Connected components===\nThe [[maximal element|maximal]] connected subsets (ordered by [[subset|inclusion]]) of a nonempty topological space are called the '''connected components''' of the space.\nThe components of any topological space ''X'' form a [[partition of a set|partition]] of&nbsp;''X'': they are [[disjoint sets|disjoint]], nonempty, and their union is the whole space.\nEvery component is a [[closed subset]] of the original space. It follows that, in the case where their number is finite, each component is also an open subset. However, if their number is infinite, this might not be the case; for instance, the connected components of the set of the [[rational number]]s are the one-point sets ([[singleton (mathematics)|singletons]]), which are not open.\n\nLet <math>\\Gamma_x</math> be the connected component of ''x'' in a topological space ''X'', and <math>\\Gamma_x'</math> be the intersection of all [[clopen]] sets containing ''x'' (called [[Locally connected space|quasi-component]] of ''x''.) Then <math>\\Gamma_x \\subset \\Gamma'_x</math> where the equality holds if ''X'' is compact Hausdorff or locally connected.\n\n===Disconnected spaces===\nA space in which all components are one-point sets is called [[totally disconnected]]. Related to this property, a space ''X'' is called '''totally separated''' if, for any two distinct elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''X'', there exist disjoint [[open sets]] ''U'' containing ''x'' and ''V'' containing ''y'' such that ''X'' is the union of ''U'' and ''V''. Clearly, any totally separated space is totally disconnected, but the converse does not hold. For example take two copies of the rational numbers '''Q''', and identify them at every point except zero. The resulting space, with the quotient topology, is totally disconnected. However, by considering the two copies of zero, one sees that the space is not totally separated. In fact, it is not even [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], and the condition of being totally separated is strictly stronger than the condition of being Hausdorff.\n\n==Examples==\n\n* The closed interval [0,&nbsp;2] in the [[Euclidean space|standard]] [[subspace topology]] is connected; although it can, for example, be written as the union of [0, 1) and [1,&nbsp;2], the second set is not open in the chosen topology of [0, 2].\n*The union of [0,&nbsp;1) and (1,&nbsp;2] is disconnected; both of these intervals are open in the standard topological space [0,&nbsp;1)&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;(1,&nbsp;2].\n* (0,&nbsp;1)&nbsp;\u222a&nbsp;{3} is disconnected.\n* A [[convex set]] is connected; it is actually [[simply connected set|simply connected]].\n* A [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]] excluding the origin, (0,&nbsp;0), is connected, but is not simply connected. The three-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is connected, and even simply connected. In contrast, the one-dimensional Euclidean space without the origin is not connected.\n* A Euclidean plane with a straight line removed is not connected since it consists of two half-planes.\n* \u211d, The space of [[real number]]s with the usual topology, is connected.\n* If even a single point is removed from \u211d, the remainder is disconnected. However, if even a countable infinity of points are removed from \u211d<sup>''n''</sup>, where ''n''\u22652, the remainder is connected.\n* Any [[topological vector space]] over a connected field is connected.\n* Every [[discrete topological space]] with at least two elements is disconnected, in fact such a space is [[totally disconnected space|totally disconnected]].  The simplest example is the [[discrete two-point space]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to Topology and Modern Analysis|author=[[George F. Simmons]]|publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company|year=1968|page=144|isbn=0-89874-551-9}}</ref>\n* On the other hand, a finite set might be connected. For example, the spectrum of a [[discrete valuation ring]] consists of two points and is connected. It is an example of a [[Sierpi\u0144ski space]].\n* The [[Cantor set]] is totally disconnected; since the set contains uncountably many points, it has uncountably many components.\n* If a space ''X'' is [[homotopy|homotopy equivalent]] to a connected space, then ''X'' is itself connected.\n* The [[topologist's sine curve]] is an example of a set that is connected but is neither path connected nor locally connected.\n* The [[general linear group]] <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbf{R})</math> (that is, the group of ''n''-by-''n'' real, invertible matrices) consists of two connected components: the one with matrices of positive determinant and the other of negative determinant. In particular, it is not connected. In contrast, <math>\\operatorname{GL}(n, \\mathbf{C})</math> is connected. More generally, the set of invertible bounded operators on a (complex) Hilbert space is connected.\n* The spectra of commutative [[local ring]] and integral domains are connected. More generally, the following are equivalent<ref>[[Charles Weibel]], [http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~weibel/Kbook.html The K-book: An introduction to algebraic K-theory]</ref>\n*# The spectrum of a commutative ring ''R'' is connected\n*# Every [[finitely generated projective module]] over ''R'' has constant rank.\n*# ''R'' has no [[idempotent]] <math>\\ne 0, 1</math> (i.e., ''R'' is not a product of two rings in a nontrivial way).\n\nAn example of a space that is not connected is a plane with an infinite line deleted from it. Other examples of disconnected spaces (that is, spaces which are not connected) include the plane with an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] removed, as well as the union of two disjoint closed [[Disk (mathematics)|disks]], where all examples of this paragraph bear the [[subspace (topology)|subspace topology]] induced by two-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\n== Path connectedness ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Covering space]] and [[path-connected]] -->\n[[File:Path-connected space.svg|thumb|This subspace of '''R'''\u00b2 is path-connected, because a path can be drawn between any two points in the space.]]\n\nA '''path-connected space''' is a stronger notion of connectedness, requiring the structure of a [[path (topology)|path]]. A '''[[path (topology)|path]]''' from a point ''x'' to a point ''y''  in a [[topological space]] ''X'' is  a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] ''f'' from the [[unit interval]] [0,1] to ''X'' with ''f''(0) = ''x'' and ''f''(1) = ''y''. A '''path-component''' of ''X'' is an [[equivalence class]] of ''X'' under the [[equivalence relation]] which makes ''x''  equivalent to ''y'' if there is a path from ''x'' to ''y''. The space ''X'' is said to be '''path-connected''' (or '''pathwise connected''' or '''0-connected''') if there is exactly one path-component, i.e. if there is a path joining any two points in ''X''. Again, many authors exclude the empty space.\n\nEvery path-connected space is connected. The converse is not always true: examples of connected spaces that are not path-connected include the extended [[long line (topology)|long line]] ''L''* and the ''[[topologist's sine curve]]''.\n\nSubsets of the [[real line]] '''R''' are connected [[if and only if]] they are path-connected; these subsets are the [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] of '''R'''.\nAlso, [[open subset]]s of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> or '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup> are connected if and only if they are path-connected.\nAdditionally, connectedness and path-connectedness are the same for [[finite topological space]]s.\n\n== Arc connectedness == <!-- Connected_space#Arc_connectedness redirects to this subsection -->\nA space ''X'' is said to be '''arc-connected''' or '''arcwise connected''' if any two distinct points can be joined by an ''arc'', that is a path ''f'' which is a [[homeomorphism]] between the unit interval [0,&nbsp;1] and its image ''f''([0,&nbsp;1]). It can be shown any [[Hausdorff space]] which is path-connected is also arc-connected. An example of a space which is path-connected but not arc-connected is provided by adding a second copy 0' of 0 to the nonnegative real numbers <nowiki>[</nowiki>0,&nbsp;\u221e<nowiki>)</nowiki>. One endows this set with a [[partially ordered set|partial order]] by specifying that 0'<''a'' for any positive number ''a'', but leaving 0 and 0' incomparable. One then endows this set with the ''order topology'', that is, one takes the open intervals\n(''a'',&nbsp;''b'') = {''x'' | ''a''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''b''}  and the half-open intervals <nowiki>[</nowiki>0,&nbsp;''a''<nowiki>)</nowiki> = {''x'' | 0&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;x&nbsp;<&nbsp;''a''}, <nowiki>[</nowiki>0',&nbsp;''a''<nowiki>)</nowiki> = {''x'' | 0'&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''a''} as a [[base (topology)|base]] for the topology. The resulting space is a [[T1 space|T<sub>1</sub>]] space but not a [[Hausdorff space]]. Clearly 0 and 0' can be connected by a path but not by an arc in this space.\n\n== Local connectedness ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Covering space]] -->\n\n{{main|Locally connected space}}\n\nA topological space is said to be '''[[Locally connected space|locally connected]] at a point''' ''x'' if every neighbourhood of ''x'' contains a connected open neighbourhood. It is '''locally connected''' if it has a [[base (topology)|base]] of connected sets. It can be shown that a space ''X'' is locally connected if and only if every component of every open set of ''X'' is open. The [[topologist's sine curve]] is an example of a connected space that is not locally connected.\n\nSimilarly, a topological space is said to be '''{{visible anchor|locally path-connected}}''' if it has a base of path-connected sets.\nAn open subset of a locally path-connected space is connected if and only if it is path-connected.\nThis generalizes the earlier statement about '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> and '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>, each of which is locally path-connected. More generally, any [[topological manifold]] is locally path-connected.\n\n[[File:Union et intersection d'ensembles.svg|thumb|Examples of unions and intersections of connected sets]]\n\nNeither local connectedness nor local path connectedness necessarily implies connectedness or path connectedness. For example, the space <math>(0,1) \\cup (2,3)</math> is locally connected and locally path connected but neither connected nor path connected.\n\n== Set operations ==\nThe '''intersection''' of connected sets is not necessarily connected.\n\n[[File:Disconnected-union-of-connected-sets.png|thumb|Each ellipse is a connected set, but the union is not connected, since it can be partitioned to two disjoint open sets U and V.]]\n\nThe '''union''' of connected sets is not necessarily connected. Consider a collection <math>\\{X_i\\}</math> of connected sets whose union is <math>X=\\cup_i{X_i}</math>. If {{mvar|X}} is disconnected and <math>U \\cup V</math> is a separation of {{mvar|X}} (with <math>U, V</math> disjoint and open in {{mvar|X}}), then each <math>X_i</math> must be entirely contained in either {{mvar|U}} or {{mvar|V}}, since otherwise, <math>X_i \\cap U</math> and <math>X_i \\cap V</math> (which are disjoint and open in <math>X_i</math>) would be a separation of <math>X_i</math>, contradicting the assumption that it is connected.\n\nThis means that, if the union {{mvar|X}} is disconnected, then the collection <math>\\{X_i\\}</math> can be partitioned to two sub-collections, such that the unions of the sub-collections are disjoint and open in {{mvar|X}}  (see picture). This implies that in several cases, a union of connected sets ''is'' necessarily connected. In particular:\n\n# If the common intersection of all sets is not empty (<math> \\cap X_i \\neq \\emptyset</math>), then obviously they cannot be partitioned to collections with disjoint unions. Hence ''the union of connected sets with non-empty intersection is connected''.\n# If the intersection of each pair of sets is not empty (<math>\\forall i,j: X_i \\cap X_j \\neq \\emptyset</math>) then again they cannot be partitioned to collections with disjoint unions, so their union must be connected.\n# If the sets can be ordered as a \"linked chain\", i.e. indexed by integer indices and <math>\\forall i: X_i \\cap X_{i+1} \\neq \\emptyset</math>, then again their union must be connected.\n# If the sets are pairwise-disjoint and the [[quotient space]] <math>X / \\{X_i\\}</math> is connected, then {{mvar|X}} must be connected. Otherwise, if <math>U \\cup V</math> is a separation of {{mvar|X}} then <math>q(U) \\cup q(V)</math> is a separation of the quotient space (since <math>q(U), q(V)</math> are disjoint and open in the quotient space).<ref>Credit: [http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/302059/how-to-prove-this-result-involving-the-quotient-maps-and-connectedness Saaqib Mahmuud and Henno Brandsma at Math StackExchange].</ref>\n\n[[File:Connectedness-of-set-difference.png|thumb|Two connected sets whose difference is not connected]]\n\nThe [[set difference]] of connected sets is not necessarily connected. However, if ''X''\u2287''Y'' and their difference ''X''\\''Y'' is disconnected (and thus can be written as a union of two open sets ''X''{{sub|1}} and ''X''{{sub|2}}), then the union of ''Y'' with each such component is connected (i.e. ''Y''\u222a''X{{sub|i}}'' is connected for all ''i'').   \n'''Proof''':<ref>Credit:  [http://math.stackexchange.com/a/302094/29780 Marek at Math StackExchange]</ref> By contradiction, suppose ''Y''\u222a''X''{{sub|1}} is not connected. So it can be written as the union of two disjoint open sets, e.g. ''Y''\u222a''X''{{sub|1}} = ''Z''{{sub|1}}\u222a''Z''{{sub|2}}. Because ''Y'' is connected, it must be entirely contained in one of these components, say ''Z''{{sub|1}}, and thus ''Z''{{sub|2}} is contained in ''X''{{sub|1}}. Now we know that:\n::''X'' = (''Y''\u222a''X''{{sub|1}})\u222a''X''{{sub|2}} = (''Z''{{sub|1}}\u222a''Z''{{sub|2}})\u222a''X''{{sub|2}} = (''Z''{{sub|1}}\u222a''X''{{sub|2}})\u222a(''Z''{{sub|2}}\u2229''X''{{sub|1}})\nThe two sets in the last union are disjoint and open in ''X'', so there is a separation of ''X'', contradicting the fact that ''X'' is connected.\n\n== Theorems <!--'Main theorem of connectedness' redirects here-->==\n*'''Main theorem of connectedness'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->: Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be topological spaces and let ''f'' : ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' be a [[continuous (topology)|continuous function]]. If ''X'' is (path-)connected then the [[image (mathematics)|image]] ''f''(''X'') is (path-)connected. This result can be considered a generalization of the [[intermediate value theorem]].\n*Every path-connected space is connected.\n*Every locally path-connected space is locally connected.\n*A locally path-connected space is path-connected if and only if it is connected.\n*The [[closure (topology)|closure]] of a connected subset is connected.  Furthermore, any subset between a connected subset and its closure is connected.\n*The connected components are always [[closed set|closed]] (but in general not open)\n*The connected components of a locally connected space are also open.\n*The connected components of a space are disjoint unions of the path-connected components (which in general are neither open nor closed).\n*Every [[Quotient space (topology)|quotient]] of a connected (resp. locally connected, path-connected, locally path-connected) space is connected (resp. locally connected, path-connected, locally path-connected).\n*Every  [[product topology|product]] of a family of connected (resp. path-connected) spaces is connected (resp. path-connected).\n*Every open subset of a locally connected (resp. locally path-connected) space is locally connected (resp. locally path-connected).\n*Every [[manifold]] is locally path-connected.\n\n==Graphs==\n[[Graph (discrete mathematics)|Graph]]s have path connected subsets, namely those subsets for which every pair of points has a path of edges joining them.\nBut it is not always possible to find a topology on the set of points which induces the same connected sets. The [[cycle graph|5-cycle]] graph (and any ''n''-cycle with ''n''>3 odd) is one such example.\n\nAs a consequence, a notion of connectedness can be formulated independently of the topology on a space. To wit, there is a category of connective spaces consisting of sets with collections of connected subsets satisfying connectivity axioms; their morphisms are those functions which map connected sets to connected sets {{harv|Muscat|Buhagiar|2006}}. Topological spaces and graphs are special cases of connective spaces; indeed, the finite connective spaces are precisely the finite graphs.\n\nHowever, every graph can be canonically made into a topological space, by treating vertices as points and edges as copies of the [[unit interval]] (see [[topological graph theory#Graphs as topological spaces]]). Then one can show that the graph is connected (in the graph theoretical sense) if and only if it is connected as a topological space.\n\n== Stronger forms of connectedness ==\nThere are stronger forms of connectedness for [[topological space]]s, for instance: \n* If there exist no two disjoint non-empty open sets in a topological space, ''X'', ''X'' must be connected, and thus [[hyperconnected space]]s are also connected.\n* Since a [[simply connected space]] is, by definition, also required to be path connected, any simply connected space is also connected. Note however, that if the \"path connectedness\" requirement is dropped from the definition of simple connectivity, a simply connected space does not need to be connected.\n*Yet stronger versions of connectivity include the notion of a [[contractible space]]. Every contractible space is path connected and thus also connected.\n\nIn general, note that any path connected space must be connected but there exist connected spaces that are not path connected. The [[Comb space|deleted comb space]] furnishes such an example, as does the above-mentioned [[topologist's sine curve]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n*[[Connected component (graph theory)]]\n*[[Connectedness locus]]\n*[[Extremally disconnected space]]\n*[[Locally connected space]]\n*[[n-connected|''n''-connected]]\n*[[Uniformly connected space]]\n*[[Pixel connectivity]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book | author= Munkres, James R. | authorlink=James Munkres  | title=Topology, Second Edition | publisher=Prentice Hall | year=2000 | isbn=0-13-181629-2}}\n* {{MathWorld|urlname=ConnectedSet|title=Connected Set}}\n* {{Springer|urlname=Connected_space|author=V.

'''''nuclei'''''; from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|nucleus}} or {{lang|la|nuculeus}}, meaning ''kernel'' or ''seed'') is a [[biological membrane|membrane]]-enclosed [[organelle]] found in [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have [[#Anucleated_cells|no nuclei]], and a few others including [[osteoclast]]s have [[Multinucleate|many]].\n\nCell nuclei contain most of the cell's [[genetics|genetic material]], organized as multiple long linear [[DNA]] molecules in a [[protein complex|complex]] with a large variety of [[protein]]s, such as [[histone]]s, to form [[chromosome]]s. The [[gene]]s within these [[chromosome]]s are the cell's [[genome|nuclear genome]] and are [[Eukaryotic Nuclear Organization|structured]] in such a way to promote cell function. The nucleus maintains the integrity of genes and controls the activities of the cell by regulating [[gene expression]]\u2014the nucleus is, therefore, the control center of the cell. The main structures making up the nucleus are the [[nuclear envelope]], a double membrane that encloses the entire organelle and isolates its contents from the cellular [[cytoplasm]], and the [[nuclear matrix]] (which includes the [[nuclear lamina]]), a network within the nucleus that adds mechanical support, much like the [[cytoskeleton]], which supports the cell as a whole.\n\nBecause the nuclear envelope is impermeable to large molecules, [[nuclear pore]]s are required to regulate [[nuclear transport]] of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a [[Ion channel|channel]] through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and [[ion]]s. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and [[RNA]] through the pores is required for both gene expression and the maintenance of chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound subcompartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of ''sub-nuclear bodies'' exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the [[nucleolus]], which is mainly involved in the assembly of [[ribosome]]s. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate [[mRNA]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Leeuwenhoek1719RedBloodCells.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Oldest known depiction of cells and their nuclei by [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]], 1719]]\n[[Image:Flemming1882Tafel1Fig14.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a ''[[Chironomus]]'' salivary gland cell published by [[Walther Flemming]] in 1882. The nucleus contains [[Polytene chromosome]]s.\n]]\nThe nucleus was the first organelle to be discovered. What is most likely the oldest preserved drawing dates back to the early microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632\u20131723). He observed a \"lumen\", the nucleus, in the [[red blood cell]]s of [[salmon]].<ref>Leeuwenhoek, A. van: Opera Omnia, seu Arcana Naturae ope exactissimorum Microscopiorum detecta, experimentis variis comprobata, Epistolis ad varios illustres viros.

Brown was studying [[orchid]]s under microscope when he observed an opaque area, which he called the \"areola\" or \"nucleus\", in the cells of the flower's outer layer.<ref name=\"Robert Brown\">{{cite journal | last =  Brown | first = Robert | title = On the Organs and Mode of Fecundation of Orchidex and Asclepiadea | journal = Miscellaneous Botanical Works I | volume =  | pages = 511\u2013514 | year = 1866}}</ref>\n\nHe did not suggest a potential function. In 1838, [[Matthias Schleiden]] proposed that the nucleus plays a role in generating cells, thus he introduced the name \"cytoblast\" (cell builder). He believed that he had observed new cells assembling around \"cytoblasts\". [[Franz Meyen]] was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells multiplying by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de novo, by the \"cytoblast\" or otherwise, contradicted work by [[Robert Remak]] (1852) and [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1855) who decisively propagated the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells (\"Omnis cellula e cellula\"). The function of the nucleus remained unclear.<ref name=\"Cremer\">{{cite book | last =Cremer| first =Thomas | title =Von der Zellenlehre zur Chromosomentheorie | edition = | year =1985 | publisher =Springer Verlag | location =Berlin, Heidelberg, New York, Tokyo | isbn = 3-540-13987-7}} Online Version [http://www.t-cremer.de/main_de/cremer/personen/info_T_Cremer.htm#book here]</ref>\n\nBetween 1877 and 1878, [[Oscar Hertwig]] published several studies on the [[fertilization]] of [[sea urchin]] eggs, showing that the nucleus of the [[sperm]] enters the [[oocyte]] and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a (single) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to [[Ernst Haeckel]]'s theory that the complete [[phylogeny]] of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a \"monerula\", a structureless mass of primordial mucus (\"Urschleim\"). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, Hertwig confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including [[amphibians]] and [[molluscs]]. [[Eduard Strasburger]] produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, [[August Weismann]] postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal germ ''cells'' for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after [[mitosis]] was discovered and the [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian rules]] were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century; the [[chromosome theory of heredity]] was therefore developed.<ref name =\"Cremer\"/>\n\n==Structures==\nThe nucleus is the largest cellular [[organelle]] in animal cells.<ref name=\"Lodish\">{{cite book  | last = Lodish   | first = H  |author2=Berk A|author3=Matsudaira P|author4=Kaiser CA|author5=Krieger M|author6=Scott MP|author7=Zipursky SL|author8=Darnell J.   | title = Molecular Cell Biology  | publisher = WH Freeman  | edition = 5th  | year = 2004  | location = New York  | isbn = 0-7167-2672-6}}</ref>\nIn [[mammal]]ian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 [[micrometre]]s (\u00b5m), which occupies about 10% of the total cell volume.<ref name=\"MBoC\">{{cite book | year = 2002 | title = Molecular Biology of the Cell, Chapter 4, pages 191\u2013234 |editor1=Bruce Alberts |editor2=Alexander Johnson |editor3=Julian Lewis |editor4=Martin Raff |editor5=Keith Roberts |editor6=Peter Walter | publisher = Garland Science | edition = 4th}}</ref> The viscous liquid within it is called [[nucleoplasm]] (or karyolymph), and is similar in composition to the [[cytosol]] found outside the nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Clegg JS |title=Properties and metabolism of the aqueous cytoplasm and its boundaries |journal=Am.

These regions are called [[nucleolar organizer regions]] (NOR). The main roles of the nucleolus are to synthesize rRNA and [[Nucleolus#Function and ribosome assembly|assemble ribosomes]]. The structural cohesion of the nucleolus depends on its activity, as ribosomal assembly in the nucleolus results in the transient association of nucleolar components, facilitating further ribosomal assembly, and hence further association.

Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected.

The main function of the cell nucleus is to control gene expression and mediate the replication of DNA during the [[cell cycle]].\n\nThe nucleus is an [[organelle]] found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear [[membrane]], it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as [[DNA]] [[molecules]], along with a variety of [[proteins]], to form [[chromosomes]].\n\n===Cell compartmentalization===\nThe nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a cytoplasmic process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to downregulate the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of [[glycolysis]], a cellular pathway for breaking down [[glucose]] to produce energy. [[Hexokinase]] is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming [[glucose-6-phosphate]] from glucose. At high concentrations of [[fructose-6-phosphate]], a molecule made later from glucose-6-phosphate, a regulator protein removes hexokinase to the nucleus,<ref name=\"Lehninger\">{{cite book | last =Lehninger | first =Albert L. |author2=Nelson, David L. |author3=Cox, Michael M. | title =Lehninger principles of biochemistry | edition =3rd | year =2000 | publisher =Worth Publishers | location =New York | isbn = 1-57259-931-6 }}</ref> where it forms a transcriptional repressor complex with nuclear proteins to reduce the expression of genes involved in glycolysis.<ref name=\"Moreno\">{{cite  journal |vauthors=Moreno F, Ahuatzi D, Riera A, Palomino CA, Herrero P |year=2005 |title = Glucose sensing through the Hxk2-dependent signalling pathway. |journal=Biochem Soc Trans | volume =  33 | issue = 1 |pages = 265\u2013268 | pmid = 15667322  | doi = 10.1042/BST0330265 }}</ref>\n\nIn order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some [[transcription factor]] proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of [[NF-\u03baB]]-controlled genes, which are involved in most [[inflammation|inflammatory]] responses, transcription is induced in response to a [[cell signaling|signal pathway]] such as that initiated by the signaling molecule [[TNF-\u03b1]], binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of signalling proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF-\u03baB. A [[nuclear localisation signal]] on the NF-\u03baB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes.<ref name=\"MBoC\" />\n\nThe compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of unspliced mRNA.<ref name=\"Gorlich\">{{cite  journal  | last = G\u00f6rlich | first = Dirk |author2=Ulrike Kutay | title = Transport between the cell nucleus and the cytoplasm | journal = Annu.

These proteins include [[helicase]]s, which unwind the double-stranded DNA molecule to facilitate access to it, [[RNA polymerase]]s, which bind to the DNA promoter to synthesize the growing RNA molecule, [[topoisomerase]]s, which change the amount of [[supercoil]]ing in DNA, helping it wind and unwind, as well as a large variety of [[transcription factor]]s that regulate expression.<ref>{{cite book |title=Genome Structure and Function: From Chromosomes Characterization to Genes Technology |last=Nicolini |first=Claudio A. |year=1997 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-7923-4565-7 }}</ref>\n\n===Processing of pre-mRNA===\n{{Main|Post-transcriptional modification}}\nNewly synthesized mRNA molecules are known as [[primary transcript]]s or pre-mRNA. They must undergo [[post-transcriptional modification]] in the nucleus before being exported to the cytoplasm; mRNA that appears in the cytoplasm without these modifications is degraded rather than used for protein [[translation (genetics)|translation]]. The three main modifications are [[5' cap]]ping, 3' [[polyadenylation]], and [[RNA splicing]]. While in the nucleus, pre-mRNA is associated with a variety of proteins in complexes known as [[heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle]]s (hnRNPs). Addition of the 5' cap occurs co-transcriptionally and is the first step in post-transcriptional modification. The 3' poly-[[adenine]] tail is only added after transcription is complete.\n\nRNA splicing, carried out by a complex called the [[spliceosome]], is the process by which [[intron]]s, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the remaining [[exon]]s connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons.<ref name=\"Lodish\" /> Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding [[antibody|antibodies]], can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different [[primary structure|protein sequences]]. This process is known as [[alternative splicing]], and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Dynamics and regulation==\n\n===Nuclear transport===\n{{Main|Nuclear transport}}\n\n[[Image:RanGTPcycle.png|360px|Right|thumb|[[Macromolecule]]s, such as [[RNA]] and [[protein]]s, are [[active transport|actively transported]] across the nuclear membrane in a process called the [[Ran (biology)|Ran]]-[[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] nuclear transport cycle.]]\n\nThe entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes.

The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by [[GTPase]]s, enzymes that [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] the molecule [[guanosine triphosphate]] (GTP) to release energy. The key GTPase in nuclear transport is [[Ran (biology)|Ran]], which can bind either GTP or GDP (guanosine diphosphate), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to dissociate from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo.<ref name=\"Pemberton\" />\n\nNuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the exportin binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm.\n\nSpecialized export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post-transcriptional modification is complete. This quality-control mechanism is important due to these molecules' central role in protein translation. Mis-expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis-incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.<ref name=\"Lodish\" />\n\n===Assembly and disassembly===\n[[File:Mitosis-fluorescent.jpg|thumb|left|230px|An image of a [[newt]] [[lung]] cell [[staining (biology)|stained]] with [[fluorescent]] [[dye]]s during [[metaphase]]. The [[mitotic spindle]] can be seen, stained green, attached to the two sets of [[chromosome]]s, stained light blue. All chromosomes but one are already at the metaphase plate. ]]\n\nDuring its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of [[cell division]] or as a consequence of [[apoptosis]] (the process of [[programmed cell death]]). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus&nbsp;\u2014 the envelope and lamina&nbsp;\u2014 can be systematically degraded.\nIn most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the [[prophase]] of [[mitosis]]. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called [[closed mitosis]], in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo [[open mitosis]], which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.\n\nAt a certain point during the [[cell cycle]] in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the [[sister chromatid]]s, attaching to [[microtubule]]s, which in turn are attached to different [[centrosome]]s. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome is located in the cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids in the presence of the nuclear envelope.<ref name=\"Lippincott-Schwartz\">{{cite  journal | last = Lippincott-Schwartz  | first = Jennifer | title = Cell biology: Ripping up the nuclear envelope | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6876 | pages = 31\u201332 | date = 7 March 2002 | doi =10.1038/416031a  | pmid = 11882878  }}</ref> Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in [[prophase]] and until around [[prometaphase]], the nuclear membrane is dismantled.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the [[CDC2|CDC2 protein kinase]].<ref name=\"Boulikas\">{{cite journal | author = Boulikas T | title = Phosphorylation of transcription factors and control of the cell cycle | journal = Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 1\u201377 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7549180}}</ref> Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.<ref name=\"Boulikas\" />\n\nHowever, in [[dinoflagellates]], the nuclear envelope remains intact, the centrosomes are located in the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., [[ciliate]]s, [[Apicomplexa|sporozoans]]) and fungi, the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.\n\n[[Apoptosis]] is a controlled process in which the cell's structural components are destroyed, resulting in death of the cell. Changes associated with apoptosis directly affect the nucleus and its contents, for example, in the condensation of chromatin and the disintegration of the nuclear envelope and lamina. The destruction of the lamin networks is controlled by specialized apoptotic [[protease]]s called [[caspase]]s, which cleave the lamin proteins and, thus, degrade the nucleus' structural integrity. Lamin cleavage is sometimes used as a laboratory indicator of caspase activity in [[assay]]s for early apoptotic activity.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Cells that express mutant caspase-resistant lamins are deficient in nuclear changes related to apoptosis, suggesting that lamins play a role in initiating the events that lead to apoptotic degradation of the nucleus.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" /> Inhibition of lamin assembly itself is an inducer of apoptosis.<ref name=\"Steen\">{{cite  journal  |vauthors=Steen R, Collas P | title = Mistargeting of B-type lamins at the end of mitosis: implications on cell survival and regulation of lamins A/C expression | journal = J Cell Biol | volume = 153 | issue = 3 | pages = 621\u2013626 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11331311 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.153.3.621 | pmc=2190567}}</ref>\n\nThe nuclear envelope acts as a barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to replicate and/or assemble.

This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.<ref name=\"RGoldman\" />\n\n===Disease-related dynamics===\nInitially, it has been suspected that [[immunoglobulins]] in general and [[autoantibodies]] in particular do not enter the nucleus.

What is important to the understanding of a life-changing moment is that it happened, not necessarily where or when it happened. The message is clear: Christmas is not about marking the actual birth date of Jesus. It is about the Incarnation of the One who became like us in all things but sin (Heb. 4:15) and who humbled Himself \"to the point of death-even death on a cross\" (Phil. 2:8). Christmas is a pinnacle feast, yes, but it is not the beginning of the liturgical year. It is a memorial, a remembrance, of the birth of Jesus, not really a celebration of the day itself.

There has been much scholarly debate concerning the exact time of the year when Jesus was born, and even in what year he was born. Actually, we do not know either. The best estimate is that Jesus was probably born in the springtime, somewhere between the years of 6 and 4 BC, as December is in the middle of the cold rainy season in [[Bethlehem]], when the sheep are kept inside and not on pasture as told in the Bible. The lack of a consistent system of timekeeping in the first century, mistakes in later calendars and calculations, and lack of historical details to cross reference events has led to this imprecision in fixing Jesus' birth.

Countries such as Japan, where Christmas is popular despite there being only a small number of Christians, have adopted many of the secular aspects of Christmas, such as gift-giving, decorations, and Christmas trees.\n\nCountries in which Christmas is not a formal public holiday include Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bhutan, Cambodia, China (excepting Hong Kong and [[Macau]]), the Comoros, Iran, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, the Maldives, Mauritania, Mongolia, Morocco, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Qatar, the Sahrawi Republic, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, and Yemen. Christmas celebrations around the world can vary markedly in form, reflecting differing cultural and national traditions.\n\nAmong countries with a strong Christian tradition, a variety of Christmas celebrations have developed that incorporate regional and local cultures. For Christians, participating in a religious service plays an important part in the recognition of the season. Christmas, along with Easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. A 2010 survey by [[LifeWay Christian Resources]] found that 47% of American households attend church services during this time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lifewayresearch.com/2010/12/20/lifeway-research-finds-americans-celebrate-christmas-yet-many-stray-from-religious-meaning/ | title=Americans Celebrate Christmas, Yet Many Stray From Religious Meaning | date=December 20, 2010 | publisher=LifeWay Christian Resources | accessdate=December 24, 2017}}</ref> In the United Kingdom, the Church of England reported an estimated attendance of {{nowrap|2.5 million}} people at Christmas services in 2015.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/10/27/british-families-only-attend-church-at-christmas-new-figures-sug/ | title=British families only attend church at Christmas, new figures suggest | first=John | last=Bingham | date=October 27, 2016 | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | accessdate=December 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] countries, people hold religious processions or [[parade]]s in the days preceding Christmas. In other countries, secular processions or parades featuring Santa Claus and other seasonal figures are often held. Family reunions and the exchange of gifts are a widespread feature of the season. Gift-giving takes place on Christmas Day in most countries. Others practice gift giving on [[Saint Nicholas Day]], and January 6, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].\n\n=== Decorations ===\n{{Main|Christmas decoration}}\n[[File:Nacimiento napolitano.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2| A typical [[Naples|Neapolitan]] ''presepe'' or ''presepio'', or Nativity scene.

When nothing happened, Boniface pointed out a young fir tree amid the roots of the oak and explained how this tree was a more fitting object of reverence as it pointed towards the Christian heaven and its triangular shape was reminiscent of the Christian trinity.}}</ref> The English language phrase \"Christmas tree\" is first recorded in 1835<ref name=Harper>Harper, Douglas, [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Christ Christ], ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', 2001.</ref> and represents an importation from the [[German language]].

The outside of houses may be decorated with lights and sometimes with illuminated [[Sled|sleighs]], [[snowmen]], and other Christmas figures. Mistletoe features prominently in European myth and folklore (for example the legend of [[Baldr]]), it is an evergreen parasitic plant which grows on trees, especially apple and poplar, and turns golden when it is dried. It is customary to hang a sprig of mistletoe in the house at Christmas, and anyone standing underneath it may be kissed. Mistletoe has sticky white berries, one of which was traditionally removed whenever someone was kissed under it. This is probably a fertility ritual.

Latin hymns such as \"[[Veni redemptor gentium]]\", written by [[Ambrose]], Archbishop of Milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the Incarnation in opposition to [[Arianism]]. \"Corde natus ex Parentis\" (\"Of the Father's love begotten\") by the Spanish poet [[Prudentius]] (d. 413) is still sung in some churches today.<ref>Miles, Clement, ''Christmas customs and traditions'', Courier Dover Publications, 1976, {{ISBN|0-486-23354-5}}, p. 32.</ref> In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Christmas \"Sequence\" or \"Prose\" was introduced in North European monasteries, developing under [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] into a sequence of rhymed [[stanza]]s. In the 12th century the Parisian monk Adam of St. Victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional [[Christmas carol]].\n\nBy the 13th century, in France, Germany, and particularly, Italy, under the influence of [[Francis of Assisi]], a strong tradition of popular Christmas songs in the native language developed.<ref>Miles, pp. 31\u201337.</ref> Christmas carols in English first appear in a 1426 work of [[John Audelay|John Awdlay]], a [[Shropshire]] chaplain, who lists twenty-five \"caroles of Cristemas\", probably sung by groups of [[Wassailing|wassailers]], who went from house to house.<ref>Miles, pp. 47\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[File:Steaua, Bucharest, 1842 crop.jpg|thumb|left|Child singers in [[Bucharest]], 1841]]\n\nThe songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as \"harvest tide\" as well as Christmas. It was only later that carols began to be sung in church. Traditionally, carols have often been based on [[medieval]] chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. Some carols like \"[[Personent hodie]]\", \"[[Good King Wenceslas]]\", and \"[[The Holly and the Ivy]]\" can be traced directly back to the [[Middle Ages]]. They are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. \"[[Adeste Fideles]]\" (O Come all ye faithful) appears in its current form in the mid-18th century, although the words may have originated in the 13th century.\n\nSinging of carols initially suffered a decline in popularity after the [[Protestant Reformation]] in northern Europe, although some Reformers, like [[Martin Luther]], wrote carols and encouraged their use in worship. Carols largely survived in rural communities until the revival of interest in popular songs in the 19th century. The 18th-century English reformer [[Charles Wesley]] understood the importance of music to worship. In addition to setting many psalms to melodies, which were influential in the [[Great Awakening]] in the United States, he wrote texts for at least three Christmas carols. The best known was originally entitled \"Hark! How All the Welkin Rings\", later renamed \"[[Hark! the Herald Angels Sing]]\".<ref>{{cite book\n |last=Dudley-Smith\n |first=Timothy\n |authorlink=Timothy Dudley-Smith\n |title=A Flame of Love\n |publisher=Triangle/SPCK\n |location=London\n |year=1987\n |isbn=0-281-04300-0\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen\n|filename=U.S. Army Band - Hark!

In the 19th and 20th century, African American spirituals and songs about Christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. An increasing number of seasonal holidays songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. In addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as The Revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music. [[John Rutter]] has composed many carols including \"[[All Bells in Paradise]]\", \"[[Angels' Carol]]\", \"[[Candlelight Carol]]\", \"[[Donkey Carol]]\", \"[[Jesus Child]]\", \"[[Shepherds' Pipe Carol]]\" and \"[[Star Carol]]\".\n\n=== Traditional cuisine ===\n[[File:Christmas pudding.JPG|thumb|right|[[Christmas pudding]] cooked on [[Stir-up Sunday]], the Sunday before the beginning of the [[Advent]] season]]\n[[File:Christmas table (Serbian cuisine).jpg|thumb|left|Christmas table in Serbia]]\nA special [[Christmas dinner|Christmas family meal]] is traditionally an important part of the holiday's celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country.

In the United Kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard Christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider.

The eating of sweets and chocolates has become popular worldwide, and sweeter Christmas delicacies include the German ''[[stollen]]'', [[marzipan]] cake or candy, and Jamaican rum fruit cake. As one of the few fruits traditionally available to northern countries in winter, oranges have been long associated with special Christmas foods. [[Eggnog]] is a [[added sugar|sweetened]] [[dairy]]-based [[sweetened beverage|beverage]] traditionally made with milk, cream, sugar, and whipped eggs (which gives it a frothy texture).

After the introduction of the Julian calendar in Rome, the 25th of December became the day of ''Sol invictus'' when people greeted the winter solstice. It was the day of the Sun's rebirth, and it was the day of the Christmas festivities \u2013 although it was only in the year 336 AD that it appears to have become established as the day of Jesus's birth (see Pannenberg 1989: 57). The Eastern Church adopted this date even later, towards the end of the 4th century, having previously regarded the 6th of January as the day of gift-giving, as it still is in the Italian community of Befana. The winter solstice was a time of festivity in every traditional culture, and the Christian Christmas probably took its place within this mythical context of the solar cult. Its core dogma of the Incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event. 'Children were given presents as the Jesus child received gifts from the magi or kings who came from afar to adore him. But in reality it was they, together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of God through man's renewed participation in the divine life' (ibid.: 61).}}<!--|accessdate=December 24, 2015--></ref>\n\n==== Gift-bearing figures ====\n{{Main|Santa Claus|Father Christmas|Christkind}}\n[[File:Christmas-gift-bringers-Europe.jpg|thumb|Christmas gift-bringers in Europe]]\n[[File:Sinterklaas 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Nicholas]], known as [[Sinterklaas]] in the Netherlands, is considered by many to be the original Santa Claus<ref name=\"SewardLal2006\">{{cite book|last1=Seward|first1=Pat|last2=Lal|first2=Sunandini Arora|title=Netherlands|year=2006|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-2052-1|page=116|quote=Until quite recently, the celebrations focused solely on Saint Nicholas, or Sinterklaas (SIN-ter-klahs), as the Dutch call him. ...

Among these are [[Father Christmas]], also known as [[Santa Claus]] (derived from the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for Saint Nicholas), P\u00e8re No\u00ebl, and the [[Weihnachtsmann]]; [[Saint Nicholas]] or [[Sinterklaas]]; the [[Christkind]]; Kris Kringle; [[Joulupukki]]; [[Nisse (folklore)|tomte/nisse]]; Babbo Natale; [[Basil of Caesarea|Saint Basil]]; and [[Ded Moroz]]. The Scandinavian tomte (also called nisse) is sometimes depicted as a [[gnome]] instead of Santa Claus.\n\nThe best known of these figures today is red-dressed Santa Claus, of diverse origins. The name Santa Claus can be traced back to the Dutch ''Sinterklaas'', which means simply Saint Nicholas. Nicholas was a 4th-century [[Greeks in Turkey#History|Greek]] [[bishop]] of [[Myra]], a city in the [[Roman province]] of [[Lycia]], whose ruins are {{convert|3|km}} from modern [[Demre]] in southwest Turkey.<ref>{{cite book |author= Domenico, Roy Palmer |title= The regions of Italy: a reference guide to history and culture |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group |year= 2002 |page=21 |isbn= 0-313-30733-4 |quote= Saint Nicholas (Bishop of Myra) replaced Sabino as the patron saint of the city...

By the 13th century, Saint Nicholas was well known in the Netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern Europe. At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in 16th\u201317th-century Europe, many Protestants changed the gift bringer to the Christ Child or ''Christkindl'', corrupted in English to Kris Kringle, and the date of giving gifts changed from December 6 to Christmas Eve.<ref name=\"ADS\" />\n\nThe modern popular image of Santa Claus, however, was created in the United States, and in particular in New York. The transformation was accomplished with the aid of notable contributors including [[Washington Irving]] and the [[German Americans|German-American]] cartoonist [[Thomas Nast]] (1840\u20131902). Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], some of the inhabitants of New York City sought out symbols of the city's non-English past.

Contractive maps are sometimes called '''Lipschitzian maps'''.  If the above condition is instead satisfied for\n''k''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;1, then the mapping is said to be a [[non-expansive map]].\n\nMore generally, the idea of a contractive mapping can be defined for maps between metric spaces.

This concept is very useful for [[iterated function systems]] where contraction mappings are often used.

Covalent bonding is implied in the [[Lewis structure]] by indicating electrons shared between atoms.]]\n\nThe term ''covalence'' in regard to bonding was first used in 1919 by [[Irving Langmuir]] in a ''[[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]'' article entitled \"The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules\". Langmuir wrote that \"we shall denote by the term ''covalence'' the number of pairs of electrons that a given atom shares with its neighbors.\"<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja02227a002|volume=41|issue=6|pages=868\u2013934|last=Langmuir|first=Irving|title=The Arrangement of Electrons in Atoms and Molecules|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1919-06-01}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of covalent bonding can be traced several years before 1919 to [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], who in 1916 described the sharing of electron pairs between atoms.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|volume=38|issue=4|pages=762\u2013785|last=Lewis|first=Gilbert N.|title=The atom and the molecule|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1916-04-01}}</ref> He introduced the ''[[Lewis Structure|Lewis notation]]'' or ''electron dot notation'' or ''Lewis dot structure'', in which valence electrons (those in the outer shell) are represented as dots around the atomic symbols. Pairs of electrons located between atoms represent covalent bonds. Multiple pairs represent multiple bonds, such as [[double bond]]s and [[triple bond]]s. An alternative form of representation, not shown here, has bond-forming electron pairs represented as solid lines.\n\nLewis proposed that an atom forms enough covalent bonds to form a full (or closed) outer electron shell. In the diagram of methane shown here, the carbon atom has a valence of four and is, therefore, surrounded by eight electrons (the [[octet rule]]), four from the carbon itself and four from the hydrogens bonded to it. Each hydrogen has a valence of one and is surrounded by two electrons (a duet rule) \u2013 its own one electron plus one from the carbon. The numbers of electrons correspond to full shells in the quantum theory of the atom; the outer shell of a carbon atom is the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2 shell, which can hold eight electrons, whereas the outer (and only) shell of a hydrogen atom is the ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 shell, which can hold only two.\n\nWhile the idea of shared electron pairs provides an effective qualitative picture of covalent bonding, [[quantum mechanics]] is needed to understand the nature of these bonds and predict the structures and properties of simple molecules. [[Walter Heitler]] and [[Fritz London]] are credited with the first successful quantum mechanical explanation of a chemical bond ([[molecular hydrogen]]) in 1927.<ref>{{cite journal|first=W.|last=Heitler|first2=F.|last2=London|title=Wechselwirkung neutraler Atome und hom\u00f6opolare Bindung nach der Quantenmechanik|trans-title=Interaction of neutral atoms and homeopolar bonds according to quantum mechanics|journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik|volume=44|issue=6\u20137|pages=455\u2013472|date=1927|doi=10.1007/bf01397394|bibcode=1927ZPhy...44..455H}} English translation in {{cite book| last = Hettema| first = H.| title = Quantum Chemistry: Classic Scientific Papers| url = https://books.google.com/?id=qsidHRJmUoIC| accessdate = 2012-02-05| year = 2000| publisher = World Scientific| isbn = 978-981-02-2771-5| pages = 140}}</ref> Their work was based on the valence bond model, which assumes that a chemical bond is formed when there is good overlap between the [[atomic orbitals]] of participating atoms.\n\n==Types of covalent bonds==\nAtomic orbitals (except for s orbitals) have specific directional properties leading to different types of covalent bonds. [[Sigma bond|Sigma (\u03c3) bond]]s are the strongest covalent bonds and are due to head-on overlapping of orbitals on two different atoms. A [[single bond]] is usually a \u03c3 bond. [[Pi bond|Pi (\u03c0) bonds]] are weaker and are due to lateral overlap between p (or d) orbitals. A [[double bond]] between two given atoms consists of one \u03c3 and one \u03c0 bond, and a [[triple bond]] is one \u03c3 and two \u03c0 bonds.\n\nCovalent bonds are also affected by the electronegativity of the connected atoms which determines the [[chemical polarity]] of the bond. Two atoms with equal electronegativity will make nonpolar covalent bonds such as H\u2013H. An unequal relationship creates a polar covalent bond such as with H\u2212Cl.  However polarity also requires [[Geometry|geometric]] [[asymmetry]], or else [[Dipole|dipoles]] may cancel out resulting in a non-polar molecule.\n\n== Covalent structures ==\nThere are several types of structures for covalent substances, including individual molecules, molecular structures, [[macromolecular]] structures and giant covalent structures. Individual molecules have strong bonds that hold the atoms together, but there are negligible forces of attraction between molecules. Such covalent substances are usually gases, for example, [[HCl]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO<sub>2</sub>]], [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]], and [[Methane|CH<sub>4</sub>]]. In molecular structures, there are weak forces of attraction. Such covalent substances are low-boiling-temperature liquids (such as [[ethanol]]), and low-melting-temperature solids (such as [[iodine]] and solid CO<sub>2</sub>). Macromolecular structures have large numbers of atoms linked by covalent bonds in chains, including synthetic polymers such as [[polyethylene]] and [[nylon]], and biopolymers such as [[protein]]s and [[starch]]. [[Network covalent bonding|Network covalent structures]] (or giant covalent structures) contain large numbers of atoms linked in sheets (such as [[graphite]]), or 3-dimensional structures (such as [[diamond]] and [[quartz]]). These substances have high melting and boiling points, are frequently brittle, and tend to have high electrical [[resistivity]]. Elements that have high [[electronegativity]], and the ability to form three or four electron pair bonds, often form such large macromolecular structures.<ref name=\"StranksEtAl1970\">{{cite book |last1=Stranks |first1=D.

The simplest example of a 1-electron bond is found in the [[dihydrogen cation]], {{chem|H|2|+}}. One-electron bonds often have about half the bond energy of a 2-electron bond, and are therefore called \"half bonds\". However, there are exceptions: in the case of [[dilithium]], the bond is actually stronger for the 1-electron {{chem|Li|2|+}} than for the 2-electron Li<sub>2</sub>. This exception can be explained in terms of [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridization]] and inner-shell effects.<ref>{{cite book | title=Valency and Bonding| publisher=Cambridge | year=2005 |pages=96\u2013100 | last1=Weinhold|first1= F. |last2= Landis|first2= C. | isbn=0-521-83128-8}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphical comparison of bonds.svg|150px|thumb|left|Comparison of the electronic structure of the three-electron bond to the conventional covalent bond.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Harcourt |editor-first=Richard D.|title=Bonding in Electron-Rich Molecules: Qualitative Valence-Bond Approach via Increased-Valence Structures |publisher=Springer |date=2015 |chapter=Chapter 2: Pauling \"3-Electron Bonds\", 4-Electron 3-Centre Bonding, and the Need for an \"Increased-Valence\" Theory|isbn=9783319166766}}</ref>]]\nThe simplest example of three-electron bonding can be found in the [[helium dimer]] cation, {{chem|He|2|+}}. It is considered a \"half bond\" because it consists of only one shared electron (rather than two); in molecular orbital terms, the third electron is in an anti-bonding orbital which cancels out half of the bond formed by the other two electrons. Another example of a molecule containing a 3-electron bond, in addition to two 2-electron bonds, is [[nitric oxide]], NO. The oxygen molecule, O<sub>2</sub> can also be regarded as having two 3-electron bonds and one 2-electron bond, which accounts for its [[paramagnetism]] and its formal bond order of 2.<ref name=\"pauling\">{{cite book|last=Pauling|first=L.|date=1960|title=The Nature of the Chemical Bond|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=340\u2013354}}</ref> [[Chlorine dioxide]] and its heavier analogues [[bromine dioxide]] and [[iodine dioxide]] also contain three-electron bonds.\n\nMolecules with odd-electron bonds are usually highly reactive. These types of bond are only stable between atoms with similar electronegativities.<ref name=\"pauling\" />\n\n== Resonance ==\n{{Main article|Resonance (chemistry)}}\nThere are situations whereby a single [[Lewis structure]] is insufficient to explain the electron configuration in a molecule, hence a superposition of structures are needed. The same two atoms in such molecules can be bonded differently in different structures (a single bond in one, a double bond in another, or even none at all), resulting in a non-integer [[bond order]]. The [[nitrate]] ion is one such example with three equivalent structures. The bond between the [[nitrogen]] and each oxygen is a double bond in one structure and a single bond in the other two, so that the average bond order for each N\u2013O interaction is {{sfrac|2 + 1 + 1|3}} = {{sfrac|4|3}}.\n\n[[File:Nitrate-ion-resonance-2D.png|400px]]\n\n=== Aromaticity ===\n{{Main article|Aromaticity}}\n\nIn [[organic chemistry]], when a molecule with a planar ring obeys [[H\u00fcckel's rule]], where the number of [[pi bond|\u03c0 electrons]] fit the formula 4''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2 (where ''n'' is an integer), it attains extra stability and symmetry. In [[benzene]], the prototypical aromatic compound, there are 6 \u03c0 bonding electrons (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, 4''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;=&nbsp;6). These occupy three delocalized \u03c0 molecular orbitals ([[molecular orbital theory]]) or form conjugate \u03c0 bonds in two resonance structures that linearly combine ([[valence bond theory]]), creating a regular [[hexagon]] exhibiting a greater stabilization than the hypothetical 1,3,5-cyclohexatriene.\n\nIn the case of [[heterocyclic]] aromatics and substituted [[benzene]]s, the electronegativity differences between different parts of the ring may dominate the chemical behaviour of aromatic ring bonds, which otherwise are equivalent.\n\n=== Hypervalence ===\n{{Main article|Hypervalent molecule}}\nCertain molecules such as [[xenon difluoride]] and [[sulfur hexafluoride]] have higher co-ordination numbers than would be possible due to strictly covalent bonding according to the [[octet rule]]. This is explained by the [[three-center four-electron bond]] (\"3c\u20134e\") model which interprets the molecular wavefunction in terms of non-bonding [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied molecular orbital]]s in [[molecular orbital theory]] and ionic-covalent [[resonance (chemistry)|resonance]] in [[valence bond theory]].\n\n=== Electron-deficiency ===\n{{Main article|Electron deficiency}}\nIn [[three-center two-electron bond]]s (\"3c\u20132e\") three atoms share two electrons in bonding. This type of bonding occurs in electron deficient compounds like [[diborane]]. Each such bond (2 per molecule in diborane) contains a pair of electrons which connect the [[boron]] atoms to each other in a [[banana]] shape, with a proton (nucleus of a hydrogen atom) in the middle of the bond, sharing electrons with both boron atoms. In certain [[cluster chemistry|cluster compounds]], so-called [[four-center two-electron bond]]s also have been postulated.\n\n== Quantum mechanical description ==\n{{main article|Chemical bonding model}}\nAfter the development of quantum mechanics, two basic theories were proposed to provide a quantum description of chemical bonding: [[valence bond theory|valence bond (VB) theory]] and [[molecular orbital theory|molecular orbital (MO) theory]].

The [[Shinto|''torii'' gate]], crisscrossed bridge and shrine, located in the median between Platte and Bijou Streets in downtown Colorado Springs, were a gift to Colorado Springs, erected in 1966 by the Rotary Club of Colorado Springs to celebrate the friendship between the two communities.

Not all certifications that use [[post-nominal letters]] are an acknowledgement of educational achievement, or an agency appointed to safeguard the public interest.\n\n==Overview==\nA certification is a third-party attestation of an individual's level of knowledge or proficiency in a certain industry or profession. They are granted by authorities in the field, such as [[professional society|professional societies]] and universities, or by private certificate-granting agencies. Most certifications are time-limited; some expire after a period of time (e.g., the lifetime of a product that required certification for use), while others can be renewed indefinitely as long as certain requirements are met. Renewal usually requires ongoing education to remain up-to-date on advancements in the field, evidenced by earning the specified number of [[continuing education]] credits (CECs), or [[continuing education unit]]s (CEUs), from approved professional development courses.\n\nMany certification programs are affiliated with professional associations, trade organizations, or private vendors interested in raising industry standards. Certificate programs are often created or endorsed by professional associations, but are typically completely independent from membership organizations. Certifications are very common in fields such as aviation, construction, technology, environment, and other industrial sectors, as well as healthcare, business, real estate, and finance.\n \nAccording to ''The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs'' (1997) by Phillip Barnhart, \"certifications are portable, since they do not depend on one company's definition of a certain job\" and they provide protential employers with \"an impartial, third-party endorsement of an individual's professional knowledge and experience\".<ref>Phillip Barnhart, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3tY8Fck5UVkC&lpg=PP1&dq=the%20guide%20to%20national%20professional%20certification%20programs&pg=PA2 The Guide to National Professional Certification Programs] (1997), HRD Press. {{ISBN|0-8493-9960-2}} Retrieved electronically 7 July 2009.</ref>\n\nCertification is different from professional licensure. In the United States, licenses are typically issued by state agencies, whereas certifications are usually awarded by professional societies or educational institutes. Obtaining a certificate is voluntary in some fields, but in others, certification from a government-accredited agency may be legally required to perform certain jobs or tasks. In other countries, licenses are typically granted by professional societies or universities and require a certificate after about three to five years and so on thereafter. The assessment process for certification may be more comprehensive than that of licensure, though sometimes the assessment process is very similar or even the same, despite differing in terms of legal status.\n\nThe [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) defines the standard for being a certifying agency as meeting the following two requirements:\n# Delivering an assessment based on industry knowledge that is independent from training courses or course providers\n# Granting a time-limited credential to anyone who meets the assessment standards\n\nThe [[Institute for Credentialing Excellence]] (ICE) is a U.S.-based organization that sets standards for the accreditation of personnel certification and certificate programs based on the ''[[Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing]]'', a joint publication of the American Educational Research Association (AERA), the American Psychological Association (APA), and the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME). Many members of the [[Association of Test Publishers]] (ATP) are also certification organizations.\n\n==Types of certifications==\nThere are three general types of certification. Listed in order of development level and portability, they are: corporate (internal), product-specific, and profession-wide.\n\nCorporate, or \"internal\" certifications, are made by a [[corporation]] or low-stakes organization for internal purposes. For example, a corporation might require a one-day training course for all sales personnel, after which they receive a certificate. While this certificate has limited portability \u2013 to other corporations, for example \u2013 it is the most simple to develop.\n\nProduct-specific certifications are more involved, and are intended to be referenced to a product across all applications. This approach is very prevalent in the [[information technology]] (IT) industry, where personnel are certified on a version of [[software]] or hardware. This type of certification is portable across locations (for example, different corporations that use that software), but not across other products. Another example could be the certifications issued for shipping personnel, which are under international standards even for the recognition of the certification body, under the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO).\n\nThe most general type of certification is profession-wide. Certification in the medical profession is often offered by particular specialties. In order to apply professional standards, increase the level of practice, and protect the public, a professional organization might establish a certification. This is intended to be portable to all places a certified professional might work. Of course, this generalization increases the cost of such a program; the process to establish a legally defensible assessment of an entire profession is very extensive. An example of this is a [[Certified Public Accountant]]&nbsp;(CPA), which would not be certified for just one corporation or one piece of [[accountancy]] software but for general work in the profession.\n\n==Professional certificates awarded by universities==\nMany universities grant professional certificates as an award for the completion of an educational program. The curriculum of a professional certificate is most often in a focused subject matter. Many professional certificates have the same curriculum as master's degrees in the same subject. Many other professional certificates offer the same courses as master's degrees in the same subject, but require the student to take fewer total courses to complete the program. Some professional certificates have a curriculum that more closely resembles a baccalaureate major in the same field.  The typical professional certificate program is between 200\u2013300 class-hours in size. It is uncommon for a program to be larger or smaller than that. Most professional certificate programs are open enrollment, but some have admissions processes. A few universities put some of their professional certificates into a subclass they refer to as advanced professional certificates.\n\nSome of the more commonly offered professional certificates include:\n* Professional Certificate in Accounting (PCA)\n* Professional Certificate in Contract Management (PCCM)\n* Professional Certificate in Customer Relationship Management (PCCRM)\n* Professional Certificate in Facility Management (PCFM)\n* Professional Certificate in Financial Planning (PCFP)\n* Professional Certificate in Graphic Design (PCGD)\n* Professional Certificate in Human Resources (PCHR)\n* Professional Certificate in Marketing (PCM)\n* Professional Certificate in Paralegal Studies (PCPS)\n* Professional Certificate in Project Management (PCPM)\n* Professional Certificate in Supply Chain Management (PCSCM)\n* Professional Certificate in Store Management (PCSM)\n* Professional Certificate in Materials Management (PCMM)\n* Professional Certificate in Technical Communication (PCTC)\n\n===Advanced professional certificate===\n''Advanced professional certificates'' are professional credentials designed to help [[professional]]s enhance their [[job performance]] and marketability in their respective fields. In many other countries, certificates are qualifications in [[higher education]]. In the [[United States]], a certificate may be offered by an institute of higher education. These certificates usually signify that a student has reached a standard of knowledge of a certain [[vocation]]al subject. Certificate programs can be completed more quickly than associate degrees and often do not have general education requirements.\n\nAn advanced professional certificate is a result of an educational process designed for individuals. Certificates are designed for both newcomers to the industry as well as seasoned professionals. Certificates are awarded by an [[educational program]] or [[academic institution]]. Completion of a certificate program indicates completion of a course or series of courses with a specific concentration that is different from an educational degree program. Course content for an advanced certificate is set forth through a variety of sources i.e. [[faculty (academic staff)|faculty]], [[committee]], [[Teacher|instructors]], and other subject matter experts in a related field. The end goal of an advanced professional certificate is so that professionals may demonstrate knowledge of course content at the end of a set period in time.\n\nInstitutions that offer advance professional certificates in various fields and industries include:\n:*[[Georgetown University]]<ref>{{cite web |author=Master of Professional Studies in Real Estate |url=http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/72/advanced-professional-certificate-in-real-estate |title=Advanced Professional Certificate in Real Estate &#124; Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies |publisher=Scs.georgetown.edu |date= |access-date=18 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716105109/http://scs.georgetown.edu/programs/72/advanced-professional-certificate-in-real-estate |archivedate=16 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n:*[[Lesley University]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lesley.edu/PageTemplate.aspx?id=8192 |title=Certificate Programs |publisher=lesley.edu}}</ref>\n:*[[New York University]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/llmjsd/advancedprofessionalcertificateprograms/advancedcertificateinlawandbusiness/index.htm |title=NYU Law \u2013 Advanced Professional Certificate Programs: Advanced Certificate in Law and Business |publisher=Law.NYU.edu |date= |access-date=18 May 2012}}</ref>\n:*[[St. John's University (New York)|St. John's University]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/tobin/academics/departments/accounting/programs/controllership/advanced_certificate.stj |title=Advanced Professional Certificate |publisher=Stjohns.edu |date=14 October 2011 |access-date=18 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601044552/http://www.stjohns.edu/academics/graduate/tobin/academics/departments/accounting/programs/controllership/advanced_certificate.stj |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n:*[[Stanford University]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Stanford Advanced Project Management Certificate (SAPM) |url=http://apm.stanford.edu/|publisher=[[Stanford University]]}}</ref>\n:*[[University of San Francisco]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Advanced Professional Certificate|url=http://www.usanfranonline.com/online-certificates/|publisher=[[University of San Francisco]]}}</ref>\n\n==Areas of certification==\n\n===Accountancy, auditing and finance===\nThere are many professional bodies for accountants and auditors throughout the world; some of them are legally recognized in their jurisdictions.\n[[Public accounting|Public accountants]] are the [[accountancy]] and [[Management accounting|control]] experts that are legally certified in different [[jurisdiction]]s to work in public practices, certifying accounts as [[statutory auditor]]s, eventually selling advice and services to other individuals and businesses.

Requirements for certifications are quite equal in most countries and are regulated by each National Aviation Authority. The existing certificates or pilot licenses are:\n* SPL (Sport Pilot License)conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]])\n* [[Private Pilot License|PPL]] (Private Pilot License) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])\n* CPL ([[Commercial Pilot Licence]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])\n* ATP ([[Airline Transport Pilot License|Airline Transport Pilot]]) conferred by the FAA ([[Federal Aviation Administration]]) or JAA ([[Joint Aviation Authorities]])\n\nLicensing in these categories require not only examinations but also a minimum number of flight hours. All categories are available for Fixed-Wing Aircraft ([[airplane]]s) and Rotatory-Wing Aircraft ([[helicopter]]s). Within each category, aviators may also obtain certifications in:\n* Instrument Flight Rules ([[Instrument flight rules|IFR]])\n* [[:Category:Multi-engine aircraft|Multi-engine aircraft]]\n* [[Turbojet]] Engines\n* [[Jet Engine]]s\n* [[Experimental aircraft]]\n* [[Amphibious aircraft]]\n* [[Seaplane]]s\nUsually, aviators must be certified also in their log books for the type and model of aircraft they are allowed to fly. Currency checks as well as regular medical check-ups with a frequency of 6 months, 12 months, or 36 months, depending on the type of flying permitted, are obligatory. An aviator can fly only if holding:\n* A valid pilot license\n* A valid medical certificate\n* Valid certifications for the type of aircraft and type of flight.\n\nIn [[Europe]], the [[Air Navigation Service Provider|ANSP]], [[Air traffic controller|ATCO]] & ANSP technicians are certified according to [[EUROCONTROL Safety Regulatory Requirement|ESARRs]] [https://archive.is/20121203024613/http://www.eurocontrol.int/src/public/standard_page/src_deliverables.html] (according to [[European Union|EU]] regulation 2096/2005 \"Common Requirements\").\n\n===Biomedical===\n* BMD (Biomedical Electronics Technician) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n* BIET (Biomedical Imaging Electronics Technician) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n\n===Business===\n{{Main article|Professional certification (business)}}\n\n===Chiropractic===\n{{Main article|List of chiropractic credentials}}\n\n===Communications===\nIn the United States, several communications certifications are conferred by the [[Electronics Technicians Association]].\n\n===Computer technology===\n{{Main article|Professional certification (computer technology)}}\nCertification is often used in the professions of [[software engineering]] and [[information technology]].\n\n* CITP (Chartered IT Professional) conferred by [[British Computer Society]], [[The Institution of Engineering and Technology]] and by other professional engineering institutions in the UK and commonwealth\n\n===Contract management===\n{{Main article|Contract management}}\nCPCM (Certified Professional Contract Manager) conferred by the National Contract Management Association.\n\n=== Dance ===\nConferred by the&nbsp;International Dance Council CID<ref name=\"cid-portal.org\">{{cite web|url=http://cid-portal.org/site/index.php|title=International Dance Council CID|author=|date=|website=CID-Portal.org|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref>&nbsp;at&nbsp;UNESCO, the International Certification of Dance Studies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cid-portal.org/site/index.php/certification|title=International Certification of Dance Studies|author=|date=|website=CID-Portal.org|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref> is awarded to students who have completed 150 hours of classes in a specific form of dance for Level 1.

Service Quality System includes activities like security, maintenance, catering, and external as well as internal cleaning. In general, it is also the coordination and harmonization of various specialist disciplines to create the best possible working environment for staff.\n\nFacility management is an interdisciplinary field devoted to the coordination of space, infrastructure, people and organization, often associated with the administration of office blocks, arenas, schools, convention centers, shopping complexes, hospitals, hotels, etc. However, FM facilitates on a wider range of activities than just business services and these are referred to as non-core functions.\n\n*[https://www.fm.training/credentials/fmp FMP]- Facility Management Professional\n*[https://www.fm.training/credentials/cfm CFM]- Certified Facility Manager\n*[https://www.fm.training/credentials/sfp SFP]- Sustainability Facility Professional\n\n{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Warehousing management===\nA warehouse management system (WMS) is a part of the supply chain and primarily aims to control the movement and storage of materials within a warehouse and process the associated transactions, including shipping, receiving, putaway and picking. The systems also direct and optimize stock putaway based on real-time information about the status of bin utilization. A WMS monitors the progress of products through the warehouse. It involves the physical warehouse infrastructure, tracking systems, and communication between product stations.\n\nMore precisely, warehouse management involves the receipt, storage and movement of goods, (normally finished goods), to intermediate storage locations or to a final customer. In the multi-echelon model for distribution, there may be multiple levels of warehouses. This includes a central warehouse, a regional warehouses (serviced by the central warehouse) and potentially retail warehouses (serviced by the regional warehouses).{{cn|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Environment===\n* [[CEnvP]] \u2013 Certified Environmental Practitioner ''of Australia and New Zealand'' (CEnvP)\n\n===Environmental health===\n* [[CPHI(C)]] \u2013 Certified Public Health Inspector (Canada)\n\n===Explosive atmospheres===\nIECEx<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iecex.com/|title=IECEx Home|author=|date=|website=www.IECEx.com|access-date=3 May 2017}}</ref> covers the highly specialized field of explosion protection associated with the use of equipment in areas where flammable gases, liquids and combustible dusts may be present. This system provides the assurance that equipment is manufactured to meet safety standards, and that services such as installation, repair and overhaul also comply with IEC International Standards on safety. The United Nations, via UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe), recommends the IEC and IECEx as the world\u2019s best practice model for the verification of conformity to International Standards. It published a \u201cCommon Regulatory Framework\u201d encompassing the use of IEC International Standards developed by IEC TC (Technical Committee) 31: Equipment for explosive atmospheres, with proof of compliance demonstrated by IECEx.\n\n===Fiber optics and data cabling===\n* RCDD (Registered Communications Distribution Designer) by [[BICSI]]\n* DCI (Data Cabling Installer) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n* FOI (Fiber Optics Installer) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n* FOT (Fiber Optics Technician) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n* FOT-OSP (Fiber Optics Technician-Outside Plant) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n* FOD (Fiber Optics Designer) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n* TTT (Termination and Testing Technician) conferred by [[Electronics Technicians Association]]\n\n===Genealogy===\n* AG (Accredited Genealogist) conferred by the International Commission for the Accreditation of Professional Genealogists (ICAPGen).\n* CG (Certified Genealogist) conferred by the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] (BCG).\n* CGL (Certified Genealogical Lecturer) conferred by the [[Board for Certification of Genealogists]] (BCG).\n\n===Health leadership===\n* CHE ([[Certified Health Executive]]) conferred by the [[Canadian College of Health Leaders]] (CCHL)\n\n===Hospitality and tourism===\n* CHA ([[Certified Hotel Administrator]]) conferred by [[American Hotel & Lodging Association]]\n* CMP ([[Certified Meeting Professional]]) conferred by [[Convention Industry Council]]\n* CEM ([[Certified in Exhibition Management]]) conferred by [[International Association of Exhibitions and Events]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iaee.com/cem|title=Certified in Exhibition Management (CEM)|publisher=|access-date=10 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Insurance and risk management===\nIn the United States, insurance professionals are licensed separately by each state. Many individuals seek one or more certifications to distinguish themselves from their peers.\n\n* American College of Financial Services:\n** [[Chartered Life Underwriter]] (CLU)\n** [[Chartered Financial Consultant]] (ChFC)\n* National Alliance for Insurance Education & Research administers the [[Certified Insurance Counselor]] (CIC)\n* Professional Liability Underwriting Society (PLUS) administers [[Registered Professional Liability Underwriter]] (RPLU).{{cn|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Language education===\n[[English language learning and teaching|TESOL]] is a large field of employment with widely varying degrees of regulation. Most provision worldwide is through the [[state school]] system of each individual country, and as such, the instructors tend to be trained primary- or [[secondary school]] teachers who are [[native speakers]] of the language of their pupils, and not of English. Though native speakers of English have been working in non-English speaking countries [[TEFL|in this capacity]] for years, it was not until the last twenty-five years or so that there was any widespread focus on training particularly for this field. Previously, workers in this sort of job were anyone from [[backpacking (travel)|backpackers]] hoping to earn some extra travel money to well-educated professionals in other fields doing [[Volunteering|volunteer]] work, or retired people. These sort of people are certainly still to be found, but there are many who consider TESOL their main profession.\n\nOne of the problems{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} facing these full-time teachers is the absence of an international governing body for the certification or licensure of English language teachers. However, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] and its subsidiary body [[UCLES]] are pioneers in trying to get some degree of accountability and quality control to consumers of English courses, through their [[CELTA]] and [[DELTA (ELT)|DELTA]] programs. [[Trinity College London]] has equivalent programs, the [[CertTESOL]] and the [[LTCL DipTESOL]]. They offer initial certificates in teaching, in which candidates are trained in [[language]] awareness and [[classroom]] techniques, and given a chance to practice teaching, after which feedback is reported. Both institutions have as a follow-up a professional diploma, usually taken after a year or two in the field. Although the initial certificate is available to anyone with a high school education, the diploma is meant to be a post-graduate qualification and in fact can be incorporated into a master's degree program.\n\n===Legal affairs===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}An increasing number of attorneys are choosing to be recognized as having special expertise in certain fields of law. According to the [[American Bar Association]], a lawyer who is a certified specialist has been recognized by an independent professional certifying organization as having an enhanced level of skill and expertise, as well as substantial involvement in an established legal specialty. These organizations require a lawyer to demonstrate special training, experience and knowledge to ensure that the lawyer's recognition is meaningful and reliable. Lawyer conduct with regard to specialty certification is regulated by the states.\n\n===Logistics and transport===\n[[Logistician]] is the profession in the logistics and transport sectors, including sea, air, land and rail modes. Professional qualification for logisticians usually carries post-nominal letters. \n\nCertification granting bodies include, but are not limited to, [[APICS|Association for Operations Management]] (APICS), [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]] (CILT), [[International Society of Logistics]] (SOLE), [[Canadian Institute of Traffic and Transportation]] (CITT), and [[Allied Council for Commerce and Logistics]] (ACCL).\n\n===Marketing===\n* CME (Certified Marketing Executive), conferred by [[Sales & Marketing Executives International|Sales & Marketing Executives International, Inc.]].\n\n===Ministers===\nChurches have their own process of who may use various religious titles. [[Protestant]] churches typically require a [[Masters of Divinity]], accreditation by the [[Christian denomination|denomination]] and [[ordination]] by the local church in order for a minister to become a \"[[Reverend]]\". Those qualifications may or may not also give government authorization to solemnize [[marriage]]s\n\n===Medicine===\n{{Main article|Medical credentials}}\n[[Board certification]] is the process by which a physician in the United States documents by written, practical or computer based testing, illustrating a mastery of knowledge and skills that define a particular area of medical specialization. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]], a not-for-profit organization, assists 24 approved medical specialty boards in the development and use of standards in the ongoing evaluation and certification of physicians.\n\nMedical specialty certification in the United States is a voluntary process. While medical licensure sets the minimum competency requirements to diagnose and treat patients, it is not specialty specific.<ref>[http://www.abms.org/about_board_certification/means.aspx What Board Certification Means]. Abms.org. Retrieved on 5 October 2013.</ref> Board certification demonstrates a physician\u2019s exceptional expertise in a particular specialty or sub-specialty of medical practice.\n\nPatients, physicians, health care providers, insurers and quality organizations regard certification as an important measure of a physician\u2019s knowledge, experience and skills to provide quality health care within a given specialty.\n\nOther professional certifications include certifications such as [[medical license]]s, [[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians]], Fellowship of the [[Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada]], [[nursing board certification]], diplomas in [[social work]]. The [[Commission for Certification in Geriatric Pharmacy]] certifies pharmacists that are knowledgeable about principles of geriatric pharmacotherapy and the provision of pharmaceutical care to the elderly.

He was the son of a wealthy family of minor nobility; his father, Anton, was a lawyer. His mother, Caroline, was the daughter of a wealthy [[Bohemian]] merchant.  He had two brothers, [[Anton Menger|Anton]] and Max, both prominent as lawyers. His son, [[Karl Menger]], was a mathematician who taught for many years at [[Illinois Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering Karl Menger |url=http://www.iit.edu/csl/events/archive/remembering_menger.shtml|accessdate=2009-03-26|publisher=[[Illinois Institute of Technology]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter attending ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' he studied law at the Universities of [[Charles University in Prague|Prague]] and [[University of Vienna|Vienna]] and later received a doctorate in jurisprudence from the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]. In the 1860s Menger left school and enjoyed a stint as a [[journalist]] reporting and analyzing market news, first at the ''Lemberger Zeitung'' in [[Lviv|Lemberg]], [[Austrian Galicia]] (now Lviv, [[Ukraine]]) and later at the ''Wiener Zeitung'' in Vienna.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://mises.org/library/biography-carl-menger-founder-austrian-school-1840-1921|title=Biography of Carl Menger: The Founder of the Austrian School (1840-1921)|last=kanopiadmin|date=2014-08-18|work=Mises Institute|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nDuring the course of his newspaper work he noticed a discrepancy between what the classical economics he was taught in school said about [[price|price determination]] and what real world market participants believed. In 1867 Menger began a study of [[political economy]] which culminated in 1871 with the publication of his ''[[Principles of Economics (Menger)|Principles of Economics]]'' ''(Grunds\u00e4tze der Volkswirtschaftslehre),'' thus becoming the father of the [[Austrian School]] of economic thought. It was in this work that he challenged classical cost-based theories of value with his theory of marginality \u2013 that price is determined at the margin.\n\nIn 1872 Menger was enrolled into the law faculty at the [[University of Vienna]] and spent the next several years teaching finance and political economy both in seminars and lectures to a growing number of students. In 1873 he received the university's chair of economic theory at the very young age of 33.\n\nIn 1876 Menger began tutoring Archduke [[Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria|Rudolf von Habsburg]], the Crown Prince of [[Austria]] in political economy and [[statistics]]. For two years Menger accompanied the prince in his travels, first through continental Europe and then later through the British Isles.<ref>The History of Economic Thought: A Reader</ref> He is also thought to have assisted the crown prince in the composition of a pamphlet, published anonymously in 1878, which was highly critical of the higher Austrian aristocracy. His association with the prince would last until Rudolf's suicide in 1889 (see the [[The Mayerling Incident|Mayerling]] Affair).\n\nIn 1878 Rudolf's father, Emperor [[Franz Josef of Austria|Franz Josef]], appointed Menger to the chair of political economy at Vienna. The title of ''Hofrat'' was conferred on him, and he was appointed to the Austrian ''[[Imperial Council (Austria)|Herrenhaus]]'' in 1900.\n\nEnsconced in his professorship he set about refining and defending the positions he took and methods he utilized in ''Principles,'' the result of which was the 1883 publication of ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics (Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Methode der Socialwissenschaften und der politischen Oekonomie insbesondere).'' The book caused a firestorm of debate, during which members of the [[Historical school of economics]] began to derisively call Menger and his students the \"Austrian School\" to emphasize their departure from mainstream economic thought in [[Germany]] \u2013 the term was specifically used in an unfavorable review by [[Gustav von Schmoller]].\n\nIn 1884 Menger responded with the pamphlet ''The Errors of Historicism in German Economics'' and launched the infamous ''[[Methodenstreit]],'' or methodological debate, between the Historical School and the Austrian School. During this time Menger began to attract like-minded disciples who would go on to make their own mark on the field of [[economics]], most notably [[Eugen von B\u00f6hm-Bawerk]], and [[Friedrich von Wieser]].\n\nIn the late 1880s Menger was appointed to head a commission to reform the Austrian monetary system. Over the course of the next decade he authored a plethora of articles which would revolutionize [[monetary theory]], including \"The Theory of Capital\" (1888) and \"Money\" (1892).<ref>\"On the Origin of Money\" (English translation by Caroline A. Foley), ''Economic Journal'', Volume 2 (1892), pp. 239\u201355.</ref> Largely due to his pessimism about the state of German scholarship, Menger resigned his professorship in 1903 to concentrate on study.\n\n==Economics==\n[[File:Menger - Untersuchungen \u00fcber das Methode der socialwissenschaften und der politischen \u00d6konomie insbesondere, 1933 - 5787924.tif|thumb|''Untersuchungen \u00fcber die Methode der Socialwissenschaften, und der Politischen Oekonomie insbesondere'', 1933]]\nMenger used his [[subjective theory of value]] to arrive at what he considered one of the most powerful insights in economics: both sides gain from exchange.\nUnlike [[William Jevons]], Menger did not believe that goods provide \u201cutils,\u201d or units of utility. Rather, he wrote, goods are valuable because they serve various uses whose importance differs. Menger also came up with an explanation of how money develops that is still accepted by some schools of thought today.<ref name=\"econlib\">{{Cite book |title=Carl Menger (1840\u20131921) |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Menger.html |work=[[The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics]] |edition=2nd |series=[[Library of Economics and Liberty]] |publisher=[[Liberty Fund]] |year=2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Works==\n* 1871 \u2013 ''Principles of Economics''\n* 1883 \u2013 ''Investigations into the Method of the Social Sciences with Special Reference to Economics''\n* 1884 \u2013 ''The Errors of Historicism in German Economics''\n* 1888 \u2013 ''The Theory of Capital''\n* 1892 \u2013 ''On the Origins of Money''\n\n==See also==\n* [[Methodenstreit]]\n* [[History of macroeconomic thought]]\n* [[Menger space]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite encyclopedia |last=White |first=Lawrence H. |authorlink= Lawrence H.

As an uncountable noun, \"civilization\" also refers to the process of a society developing into a centralized, urbanized, stratified structure. Civilizations are organized in densely populated settlements divided into [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] [[social class]]es with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade. Civilization concentrates power, extending human control over the rest of nature, including over other human beings.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Sources of Social Power |last=Mann |first=Michael |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1986 |volume=1 |pages=34\u201341 |author-link=Michael Mann (sociologist)}}</ref>\n\nCivilization, as its etymology (below) suggests, is a concept originally linked to towns and cities.

Notably, [[Hans Peter Duerr]] attacked it in a major work (3,500 pages in five volumes, published 1988\u20132002). Elias, at the time a nonagenarian, was still able to respond to the criticism the year before his death. In 2002, Duerr was himself criticized by Michael Hinz's ''Der Zivilisationsproze\u00df: Mythos oder Realit\u00e4t'' (2002), saying that his criticism amounted to a hateful defamation of Elias, through excessive standards of [[political correctness]].  ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-25327104.html 40/2002]</ref> In ''The Philosophy of Civilization'' (1923), [[Albert Schweitzer]] outlines two opinions: one purely [[materialism|material]] and the other material and [[ethic]]al. He said that the world crisis was from humanity losing the ethical idea of civilization, \"the sum total of all progress made by man in every sphere of action and from every point of view in so far as the progress helps towards the spiritual perfecting of individuals as the progress of all progress\".{{page needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nAdjectives like \"civility\" developed in the mid-16th century. The abstract noun \"civilization\", meaning \"civilized condition\", came in the 1760s, again from French. The first known use in French is in 1757, by [[Victor Riqueti, marquis de Mirabeau]], and the first use in English is attributed to [[Adam Ferguson]], who in his 1767 ''[[Essay on the History of Civil Society]]'' wrote, <!-- Keep original spelling please. -->\"Not only the individual advances from infancy to manhood, but the species itself from rudeness to civilisation\".<ref name=Benveniste>Cited after [[\u00c9mile Benveniste]], ''Civilisation.

This is still the case in French.<ref name=velkley/> The use of \"civilizations\" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century,<ref>E.g. in the title ''A narrative of the loss of the Winterton East Indiaman wrecked on the coast of Madagascar in 1792; and of the sufferings connected with that event.

One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of [[Rousseau]], particularly his work about education, ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Emile]]''. Here, civilization, being more [[Reason|rational]] and socially driven, is not fully in accord with [[human nature]], and \"human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original prediscursive or prerational natural unity\" (see [[noble savage]]). From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], and later by philosophers such as [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Nietzsche]]. This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by \"conscious, rational, deliberative acts\", but a kind of pre-rational \"folk spirit\". Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to \"vices of social life\" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice.<ref name=velkley>{{Citation|title=Being after Rousseau: Philosophy and Culture in Question| last=Velkley|first=Richard|year=2002|chapter=The Tension in the Beautiful: On Culture and Civilization in Rousseau and German Philosophy|pages=11\u201330|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}</ref> In [[World War II]], [[Leo Strauss]], having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind [[Nazism]] and German [[militarism]] and [[nihilism]].<ref>\"[https://archive.org/details/LeoStraussOnGermanNihilism1941 On German Nihilism]\" (1999, originally a 1941 lecture), ''Interpretation'' 26, no. 3 edited by David Janssens and Daniel Tanguay.</ref>\n\n== Characteristics ==\n[[File:Gr\u00fcn - The End of Dinner.jpg|thumb|The emergence of [[table manners]] and other forms of [[etiquette]] and [[self-restraint]] are presented as one of the characteristics of ''civilized'' society by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939).

[[Andrew Nikiforuk]] argues that \"civilizations relied on shackled human muscle. It took the energy of slaves to plant crops, clothe emperors, and build cities\" and considers slavery to be a common feature of pre-modern civilizations.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Energy of Slaves: Oil and the new servitude |last=Nikiforuk |first=Andrew |publisher=Greystone Books |year=2012}}</ref>\n\nAll civilizations have depended on [[agriculture]] for subsistence, with the possible exception of some early civilizations in [[Peru]] which may have depended upon maritime resources.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hallofmaat.com/modules.php?name=Articles&file=article&sid=85 | title= The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization: An Evolving Hypothesis | last=Moseley | first=Michael | publisher= The Hall of Ma'at |format= |work= | accessdate= 2008-06-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Moseley |first=Michael | title = The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization |year=1975 |publisher=Cummings |location=Menlo Park |isbn=978-0-8465-4800-3}}</ref> Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial [[fertilisation|fertilization]], [[irrigation]] and [[crop rotation]]. It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare.<ref>Hadjikoumis; Angelos, Robinson; and Sarah Viner-Daniels (Eds) (2011), \"Dynamics of Neolithisation in Europe: Studies in honour of Andrew Sherratt\" (Oxbow Books)</ref> [[Grain]] surpluses have been especially important because grain can be [[food storage|stored]] for a long time. A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides produce food for a living: early civilizations included [[soldiers]], [[artisan]]s, [[priest]]s and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers. A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations. However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the [[Pacific Northwest]] and perhaps during the [[Mesolithic]] [[Natufian culture]]. It is possible that food surpluses and relatively large scale social organization and division of labour predates plant and animal domestication.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/06/gobekli-tepe/mann-text/1 |title= G\u00f6bekli Tepe |publisher= [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|accessdate=|date = June 2011|last= Mann|first = Charles C.}}</ref>\n\nCivilizations have distinctly different settlement patterns from other societies.

Living in one place allows people to accumulate more [[Ownership|personal possessions]] than nomadic people. Some people also acquire [[landed property]], or private ownership of the land. Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must [[trade]] their goods and services for food in a [[Market (economics)|market]] system, or receive food through the levy of [[tribute]], redistributive [[taxation]], [[tariffs]] or [[tithe]]s from the food producing segment of the population. Early human cultures functioned through a [[gift economy]] supplemented by limited [[barter]] systems. By the early [[Iron Age]], contemporary civilizations developed [[money]] as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions. In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer. In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot. These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time. A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled. From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites.\n\n[[Writing]], developed first by people in [[Sumer]], is considered a hallmark of civilization and \"appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancient Cahokia and the Mississippians|last=Pauketat|first=Timothy R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|isbn=9780521520669|location=|pages=169}}</ref> Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records. Like money, writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other. However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown the [[Inca]] civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all except from a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes instead: the \"Quipus\", whose still functioned as a civilized society.\n\nAided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits. These include organized [[religion]], development in the [[arts]], and countless new advances in [[science]] and [[technology]].\n\nThrough history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people. Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day. These cultures are called by some \"[[primitive culture|primitive]]\", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative. \"Primitive\" implies in some way that a culture is \"first\" (Latin = ''primus''), that it has not changed since the dawn of humanity, though this has been demonstrated not to be true. Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized. Anthropologists today use the term \"[[Protohistoric archaeology|non-literate]]\" to describe these peoples.\n\nCivilization has been spread by [[colonization]], [[imperialism|invasion]], [[religious conversion]], the extension of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic control]] and [[trade]], and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples. Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour. But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders.\n\nAssessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trade or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its [[division of labor|division of labour]], and the carrying capacity of its [[urbanism|urban centres]]. Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and [[tort]]-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, [[metallurgy]], political structures and organized religion.\n\nTraditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as \"civilized\" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence\u2014calling the latter [[barbarians]], [[wikt:savages|savages]], and [[primitive culture|primitives]]. In a modern-day context, \"civilized people\" have been contrasted with [[indigenous people]] or [[tribal societies]].\n\n== Cultural identity ==\n{{further|Cultural area}}\n<!-- [[File:Persepolis iran.jpg;The king of Holy Kingdon Rum kneel of the king of Arabia]] comment to remove redlinked img-->\n\"Civilization\" can also refer to the [[culture]] of a complex society, not just the society itself. Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique. Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a [[state (polity)|state]]-based [[decision making]] apparatus, a [[literature]], professional [[art]], [[architecture]], organized [[religion]] and complex customs of [[education]], [[coercion]] and control associated with maintaining the elite.\n\n[[File:Clash_of_Civilizations_mapn2.png|thumb|upright=2.0|A world map of major civilizations according to the political hypothesis ''[[Clash of Civilizations]]'' by [[Samuel P. Huntington]]]]\n\nThe intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being [[China|Chinese]] civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as [[Korea]], [[Japan]] and [[Vietnam]]). Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions. The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.\n\nMany historians have focused on these broad cultural spheres and have treated civilizations as discrete units. Early twentieth-century philosopher [[Oswald Spengler]],<ref name=\"Spengler, Oswald 1919\">Spengler, Oswald, ''Decline of the West: Perspectives of World History'' (1919)</ref> uses the German word ''Kultur'', \"culture\", for what many call a \"civilization\". Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol. Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol. Spengler states civilization is the beginning of the decline of a culture as \"the most external and artificial states of which a species of developed humanity is capable\".<ref name=\"Spengler, Oswald 1919\" />\n\nThis \"unified culture\" concept of civilization also influenced the theories of historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in the mid-twentieth century. Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume ''[[A Study of History]],'' which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five \"arrested civilizations\". Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a \"creative minority\", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes.\n\n[[Samuel P. Huntington]] defines civilization as \"the highest cultural grouping of people and the broadest level of cultural identity people have short of that which distinguishes humans from other species\". Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed [[Civilization#Future|below]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LO4xG-bH1CQC&pg=PA43 |title=The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order |last=Huntington |first=Samuel P. |date=1997 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=9781416561248 |pages=43 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Complex systems ==\nAnother group of theorists, making use of [[systems theory]], looks at a civilization as a [[complex system]], i.e., a framework by which a group of objects can be analysed that work in concert to produce some result. Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them. Any organization is a complex [[social system]] and a civilization is a large organization. Systems theory helps guard against superficial but misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.\n\nSystems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations. These spheres often occur on different scales. For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres. Extensive trade routes, including the [[Silk Road]] through [[Central Asia]] and [[Indian Ocean]] sea routes linking the [[Roman Empire]], [[History of Iran|Persian Empire]], [[India]] and [[China]], were well established 2000 years ago, when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations. The first evidence of such long distance trade is in the [[Ancient history|ancient world]]. During the [[Uruk period]], Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan.<ref>Algaze, Guillermo, ''The Uruk World System: The Dynamics of Expansion of Early Mesopotamian Civilization'' (Second Edition, 2004) ({{ISBN|978-0-226-01382-4}})</ref> Resin found later in the [[Royal Cemetery at Ur]] is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.\n\nMany theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single \"[[world-system theory|world system]]\", a process known as [[globalization]]. Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways. There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration \u2013 cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic \u2013 is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization. [[David Wilkinson (political scientist)|David Wilkinson]] has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the \"Central Civilization\" around 1500 BCE.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/spc/index.php/CCR/article/view/12262/12162|title=Central Civilization|last1=Wilkinson|first1=David|author-link1=David Wilkinson (political scientist)|journal=[[Comparative Civilizations Review]]|volume=17|issue=|date=Fall 1987|pages=31\u201359}}</ref> Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century. According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization. What Huntington calls the \"clash of civilizations\" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization. Others point to the [[Crusades]] as the first step in globalization. The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since [[Ancient history|ancient times]], and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism. {{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of the world}}\n\nThe notion of [[world history]] as a succession of \"civilizations\" is an entirely modern one.\nIn the European [[Age of Discovery]], emerging [[Modernity]] was put into stark contrast with the\n[[Neolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]  stage of the cultures of the [[New World]], suggesting \nthat the complex states had emerged at some time in prehistory.<ref>\n\"Explicit theories of the origin of the state are relatively modern [...] the age of exploration, by making Europeans aware that many peoples throughout the world lived, not in states, but in independent villages or tribes, made the state seem less natural, and thus more in need of explanation.\"\n{{cite web |url=http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |title=A Theory of the Origin of the State |accessdate=2014-08-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530140606/http://72.52.202.216/~fenderse/Carneiro.htm |archivedate=30 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }} </ref> \nThe term \"civilization\" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralisation,  social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the [[Fertile Crescent]] in the [[Early Bronze Age]], around roughly 3000 BC.\n[[Gordon Childe]] defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the [[Neolithic Revolution]], triggering the development of settled communities, and the [[Urban Revolution]].\n\n=== Urban Revolution===\n{{Main article|Neolithic|Bronze Age|Cradle of Civilization}}\nAt first, the [[Neolithic]] was associated with shifting subsistence cultivation, where continuous farming led to the depletion of soil fertility resulting in the requirement to cultivate fields further and further removed from the settlement, eventually compelling the settlement itself to move.

Gibbon suggested the final act of the collapse of Rome was the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453 CE. For Gibbon, \"The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight. The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long\".<ref>Gibbon, ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'', 2nd ed., vol. 4, ed. by J.

General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.</ref>\n* [[Theodor Mommsen]] in his ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'' suggested Rome collapsed with the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in 476 CE and he also tended towards a biological analogy of \"genesis\", \"growth\", \"senescence\", \"collapse\" and \"decay\".\n* [[Oswald Spengler]], in his ''[[Decline of the West]]'' rejected [[Petrarch]]'s chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight \"mature civilizations\". Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in [[plutocracy]] and ultimately [[imperialism]].\n* [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] in his ''[[A Study of History]]'' suggested that there had been a much larger number of civilizations, including a small number of arrested civilizations, and that all civilizations tended to go through the cycle identified by Mommsen. The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural [[elite]] became a [[parasitic]] elite, leading to the rise of internal and external [[proletariat]]s.\n* [[Joseph Tainter]] in ''[[Societal collapse|The Collapse of Complex Societies]]'' suggested that there were [[diminishing returns]] to [[complexity]], due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return. Tainter suggested that Rome achieved this figure in the 2nd century CE.\n* [[Jared Diamond]] in his 2005 book ''[[Collapse (book)|Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed]]'' suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]]; [[climate change]]; dependence upon [[international trade|long-distance trade]] for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems.\n* [[Peter Turchin]] in his [https://web.archive.org/web/20060830212141/http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/faculty/turchin/HistDyn.htm ''Historical Dynamics''] and [[Andrey Korotayev]] ''et al.'' in their [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=172&Itemid=70 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends''] suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations. For example, the basic logic of Turchin's \"fiscal-demographic\" model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic [[Social cycle theory|cycle]] we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high [[population growth]] rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production. As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues. During the intermediate phase, the increasing [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state. As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems. During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population. Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin. ''Historical Dynamics.'' [[Princeton University Press]], 2003:121\u2013127; [[Andrey Korotayev]] et al. [http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=302&Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends.

The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire. Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the [[Han Dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties of China, to the Muslim [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and others.\n* [[Bryan Ward-Perkins]], in his book ''The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization'',<ref>{{cite book|author=Bryan Ward-Perkins|title=The Fall of Rome: And the End of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2vSUh9KbfKAC|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=7 September 2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-280728-1}}</ref> shows the real horrors associated with the collapse of a civilization for the people who suffer its effects, unlike many revisionist historians who downplay this. The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years. Similar [[Greek dark ages|Dark Age]] collapses are seen with the Late [[Bronze Age collapse]] in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], on [[Easter Island]] and elsewhere.\n* [[Arthur Demarest]] argues in ''[[Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization]]'',<ref>{{ISBN|0-521-53390-2}}</ref> using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archaeology, [[paleoecology]], and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay. He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.\n* Jeffrey A. McNeely has recently suggested that \"a review of historical evidence shows that past civilizations have tended to [[over-exploit]] their forests, and that such abuse of important resources has been a significant factor in the decline of the over-exploiting society\".<ref>McNeely, Jeffrey A.

Biodiversity and Conservation)</ref>\n* [[Thomas Homer-Dixon]] in [http://www.theupsideofdown.com/ ''The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization''], where he considers that the fall in the [[EROEI|energy return on investments]]. The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations. The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow. When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse.\n* [[Feliks Koneczny]] in his work \"On the Plurality of Civilizations\"  calls his study the science on civilizations. Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a \"biological\" life span. There still exist two ancient civilizations\u2014Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese\u2014which are not ready to fall any time soon. Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it. One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that \"a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways\" without falling into what he calls an \"abcivilized state\" (as in abnormal). He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own \"method of organizing social life\" upon the other.<ref>Koneczny, Feliks (1962) On the Plurality of Civilizations, Posthumous English translation by Polonica Publications, London ASIN: B0000CLABJ.

Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible.<ref>Berman, Morris (2007), ''Dark Ages America: the End of Empire'' (W.W.Norton)</ref>  Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, [[Jane Jacobs]] who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions. The corrosion of these pillars, Jacobs argues, is linked to societal ills such as environmental crisis, racism and the growing gulf between rich and poor.<ref>Jacobs, Jane (2005), ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Vintage)</ref>\n\nSome environmental scientists also see the world entering a [[Planetary Phase of Civilization]], characterized by a shift away from independent, disconnected nation-states to a world of increased global connectivity with worldwide institutions, environmental challenges, economic systems, and consciousness.<ref>[http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html Orion Thoughts on America<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515112558/http://www.orionsociety.org/pages/oo/sidebars/America/Rockefeller.html |date=15 May 2008 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml Kosmos Journal Paths to Planetary Civilization<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712162009/http://www.kosmosjournal.org/kjo/backissue/s2006/laszlo-1.shtml |date=12 July 2006 }}</ref> In an attempt to better understand what a Planetary Phase of Civilization might look like in the current context of declining natural resources and increasing consumption, the [[Global scenario group]] used [[scenario analysis]] to arrive at three archetypal futures: Barbarization, in which increasing conflicts result in either a fortress world or complete societal breakdown; Conventional Worlds, in which market forces or policy reform slowly precipitate more sustainable practices; and a Great Transition, in which either the sum of fragmented [[Eco-Communalism]] movements add up to a sustainable world or globally coordinated efforts and initiatives result in a new [[sustainability]] paradigm.<ref>[http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf GTinitiative.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814021505/http://www.gtinitiative.org/documents/Great_Transitions.pdf |date=14 August 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Cultural critic]] and author [[Derrick Jensen]] argues that modern civilization is directed towards the domination of the environment and humanity itself in an intrinsically harmful, unsustainable, and self-destructive fashion.<ref>Jensen, Derrick (2006), \"Endgame: The Problem of Civilization\", Vol 1 & Vol 2 (Seven Stories Press)</ref> Defending his definition both linguistically and historically, he defines civilization as \"a culture... that both leads to and emerges from the growth of cities\", with \"cities\" defined as \"people living more or less permanently in one place in densities high enough to require the routine importation of food and other necessities of life\".<ref>Jensen, Derrick (2006), \"Endgame: The Problem of Civilization\", Vol 1 (Seven Stories Press), p. 17</ref> This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources.

It has undergone numerous revisions for various platforms (including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Macintosh]], [[Amiga]], [[Atari ST]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]], [[Sega Saturn]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] and [[N-Gage (device)|N-Gage]]) and now exists in several versions. A multiplayer [[Video game remake|remake]], '''''Sid Meier's CivNet''''' was released for the PC in 1995.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:CivilizationAmigaAGA.png|thumb|left|A world map screenshot from the [[Amiga]] version of ''Civilization'']]\n\n''Civilization'' is a turn-based single- or multiplayer strategy game. The player takes on the role of the ruler of a [[civilization]], starting with one (or occasionally two) settler units, and attempts to build an [[empire]] in competition with two to seven other civilizations. The game requires a fair amount of [[micromanagement (gameplay)|micromanagement]] (although less than other [[simulation game]]s).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civfanatics.com/civ1/manual/civ1_man.htm#2a |title=Civilization manual at Civ Fanatics |publisher=Civfanatics.com |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708184142/http://www.civfanatics.com/civ1/manual/civ1_man.htm |archivedate=July 8, 2013 }}</ref> Along with the larger tasks of [[exploration]], [[warfare]] and [[diplomacy]], the player has to make decisions about where to build new cities, which improvements or units to build in each city, which advances in knowledge should be sought (and at what rate), and how to transform the land surrounding the cities for maximum benefit. From time to time the player's towns may be harassed by [[barbarian]]s, units with no specific nationality and no named leader. These threats only come from unclaimed land or sea, so that over time there are fewer and fewer places from which barbarians will emanate.\n\nBefore the game begins, the player chooses which historical or current civilization to play. In contrast to later games in the ''Civilization'' series, this is largely a cosmetic choice, affecting titles, city names, musical heralds, and color. The choice does affect their starting position on the \"Play on Earth\" map, and thus different resources in one's initial cities, but has no effect on starting position when starting a random world game or a customized world game. The player's choice of civilization also prevents the computer from being able to play as that civilization or the other civilization of the same color, and since computer-controlled opponents display certain traits of their civilizations this affects gameplay as well. The [[Aztec]]s are both fiercely expansionist and generally extremely wealthy, for example. Other civilizations include the Americans, the [[Mongols]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. Each civilization is led by a famous historical figure, such as [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]] for India.\n\nThe scope of ''Civilization'' is larger than most other games. The game begins in [[4th millennium BC|4000 BC]], before the [[Bronze Age]], and can last through to AD 2100 (on the easiest setting) with [[Space Age]] and \"future technologies\". At the start of the game there are no cities anywhere in the world: the player controls one or two settler units, which can be used to found new cities in appropriate sites (and those cities may build other settler units, which can go out and found new cities, thus expanding the empire). Settlers can also alter terrain, build improvements such as mines and [[irrigation]], build roads to connect cities, and later in the game they can construct railroads which offer unlimited movement.\n\nAs time advances, new technologies are developed; these technologies are the primary way in which the game changes and grows. At the start, players choose from advances such as [[pottery]], the [[wheel]], and the [[alphabet]] to, near the end of the game, [[nuclear fission]] and [[spaceflight]]. Players can gain a large advantage if their civilization is the first to learn a particular technology (the secrets of flight, for example) and put it to use in a military or other context. Most advances give access to new units, city improvements or derivative technologies: for example, the [[chariot]] unit becomes available after the wheel is developed, and the [[granary]] building becomes available to build after pottery is developed. The whole system of advancements from beginning to end is called the [[technology tree]], or simply the Tech tree; this concept has been adopted in many other strategy games. Since only one tech may be \"researched\" at any given time, the order in which technologies are chosen makes a considerable difference in the outcome of the game and generally reflects the player's preferred style of gameplay.\n\nPlayers can also build ''[[Wonders of the World]]'' in each of the epochs of the game, subject only to obtaining the prerequisite knowledge. These wonders are important achievements of society, science, culture and defense, ranging from the [[Egyptian pyramids|Pyramid]]s and the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] in the Ancient age, to [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus' Observatory]] and [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan's Expedition]] in the middle period, up to the [[Apollo program]], the [[United Nations]], and the [[Manhattan Project]] in the modern era. Each wonder can only be built once in the world, and requires a lot of resources to build, far more than most other city buildings or units. Wonders provide unique benefits to the controlling civilization. For example, Magellan's Expedition increases the movement rate of naval units. Wonders typically affect either the city in which they are built (for example, the [[Colossus of Rhodes|Colossus]]), every city on the continent (for example, J.S. Bach's Cathedral), or the civilization as a whole (for example, [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|Darwin's Voyage]]). Some wonders are made obsolete by new technologies.\n\nThe game can be won by conquering all other civilizations or by winning the [[space colonization|space race]] by reaching the star system of [[Alpha Centauri]].\n\n==Development==\n===Prior ''Civilization''-named games===\nBritish designer [[Francis Tresham (game designer)|Francis Tresham]] released his ''[[Civilization (1980 board game)|Civilization]]'' board game in 1980 under his company Hartland Trefoil. [[Avalon Hill]] had obtained the rights to publish it in the United States in 1981.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/>\n\nThere were at least two attempts to make a computerized version of Tresham's game prior to 1990. [[Danielle Bunten Berry]] planned to start work on the game after completing ''[[M.U.L.E.]]'' in 1983, and again in 1985, after completing ''[[The Seven Cities of Gold (video game)|The Seven Cities of Gold]]'' at [[Electronic Arts]]. In 1983 Bunten and producer [[Joe Ybarra]] opted to first do ''Seven Cities of Gold''. The success of ''Seven Cities'' in 1985 in turn led to a sequel, ''[[Heart of Africa]]''. Bunten never returned to the idea of ''Civilization''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization/trivia |title=Game Trivia for Sid Meier's Civilization |publisher=Mobygames.com |date= |accessdate=November 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202152822/http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization/trivia |archivedate=February 2, 2014 }}</ref> [[Don Daglow]], designer of ''[[Utopia (video game)|Utopia]]'', the first [[simulation game]], began work programming a version of ''Civilization'' in 1987.

Among other works, Shelley had been responsible for adapting the railroad-based ''[[1829 (board game)|1829]]'' board game developed by Tresham into ''[[1830: The Game of Railroads and Robber Barons]]''.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Shelley had joined MicroProse finding that the board game market was weakening in contrast to the video game market, and initially worked on ''F-19 Stealth Fighter''.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Meier recognized Shelley's abilities and background in game design and took him on as personal assistant designer to brainstorm new game ideas. The two initially worked on ideas for ''[[Sid Meier's Covert Action|Covert Action]]'', but had put these aside when they came up with the concepts for ''[[Railroad Tycoon]]'' (1990), based loosely on the ''1829''/''1830'' board games.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> ''Railroad Tycoon'' was generally well received at its release, but the title did not fit within the nature of flight simulators and military strategy from MicroProse's previous catalog. Meier and Shelley had started a sequel to ''Railroad Tycoon'' shortly after its release, but Stealey canceled the project.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/>\n\nOne positive aspect both had taken from ''Railroad Tycoon'' was the idea of multiple smaller systems working together at the same time and the player having to manage them.<ref name=gamedesigntheory/> Both Meier and Shelley recognized that the complex interactions between these systems led players to \"make a lot of interesting decisions\", and that ruling a whole civilization would readily work well with these underlying systems.<ref name=\"arstech gdc2017\">{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/sid-meier-tells-civilizations-origin-story-cites-childrens-history-books/ |title=Sid Meier tells Civilization\u2019s origin story, cites children\u2019s history books |first=Sam |last=Mackovech |date=March 3, 2017 |accessdate=March 3, 2017 |work=[[Ars Technica]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303214459/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/03/sid-meier-tells-civilizations-origin-story-cites-childrens-history-books/ |archivedate=March 3, 2017 }}</ref> Some time later, both discussed their love of the [[Classic Empire|original ''Empire'' computer games]], and Meier challenged Shelley to give him ten things he'd change about ''Empire''; Shelley provided him with twelve. Around May 1990, Meier presented Shelley with a 5-1/4\" [[floppy disk]] which contained the first prototype of ''Civilization'' based on their past discussions and Shelley's list.<ref name=\"arstech gdc2017\"/> \n\nMeier's prototype took elements from ''Empire'', ''Railroad Tycoon'', ''SimCity'' and the ''Civilization'' board game.<ref name=\"arstech gdc2017\"/>  This initial version of this game was a real-time simulation, with the player defining zones for their population to grow similar to zoning in ''SimCity''.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Meier and Shelley went back and forth with this, with Shelley providing suggestions based on his playthrough and acting as the game's producer, and Meier coding and reworking the game to address these points, and otherwise without involvement of other MicroProse staff.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> During this period, Stealey and the other managers became concerned that this game did not fit MicroProse's general catalog as computer strategies games had yet proven successful.<ref name=\"arstech gdc2017\"/> A few months into the development, Stealey requested them to put the project on hold and complete ''Covert Action'', after which they could go back to their new game. Meier and Shelley completed ''Covert Action'' which was published in 1990.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/>\n\n[[File:Freeciv-2.1.8 technology tree.png|right|thumb|Meier introduced a [[technology tree]] in ''Civilization'', similar to this one from the open-source variation, ''[[Freeciv]]'', to create non-linear ways to play the game]]\nOnce ''Covert Action'' was released, Meier and Shelley returned to the prototype. The time away from the project allowed them to recognize that the real-time aspect was not working well, and reworked the game to become turn-based and dropped the zoning aspect.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> They incorporated elements of city management and military aspect from ''Empire'', including creating individual military units as well as settler units that replaced the functionality of the zoning approach.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Meier felt adding military and combat to the game was necessary as \"The game really isn't about being civilized. The competition is what makes the game fun and the players play their best. At times, you have to make the player uncomfortable for the good of the player\".{{r|cgw199307}} Meier also opted to include a [[technology tree]] that would help to open the game to many more choices to the player as it continued, creating a non-linear experience. Meier felt players would be able to use the technology tree to adopt a style of play and from which they could use technologies to barter with the other opponents.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> While the game relies on established recorded history, Meier admitted he did not spend much time in research, usually only to assure the proper chronology or spellings; Shelley noted that they wanted to design for fun, not accuracy, and that \"Everything we needed was pretty much available in the children\u2019s section of the library.\"<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/><ref name=\"arstech gdc2017\"/>\n\n''Computer Gaming World'' reported in 1994 that \"Sid Meier has stated on numerous occasions that he emphasizes the 'fun parts' of a simulation and throws out the rest\".<ref name=\"brooks199405\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Brooks\n |first=M.

He said that by contrast, minefields and minesweepers caused the computer to do \"stupid things ... If you've got a feature that makes the AI look stupid, take it out. It's more important not to have stupid AI than to have good AI\". Meier also omitted jets and helicopters because he thought players would not find obtaining new technologies in the endgame useful, and online multiplayer support because of the small number of online players (\"if you had friends, you wouldn't need to play computer games\"); he also did not believe that online play worked well with turn-based play.<ref name=\"cgw199307\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=108 |title=The 7th International Computer Game Developers Conference |work=Computer Gaming World |date=July 1993 |accessdate=July 12, 2014 |pages=34 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714200342/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=108 |archivedate=July 14, 2014 }}</ref> The game was developed for the IBM PC platform, which at the time had support for both 16-color [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] to 256-color [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]]; Meier opted to stay with the basic EGA support to allow the game to run on both EGA and VGA systems.<ref name=\"gamasutra\">{{cite web\n |year=2007 \n |author=Benj Edwards \n |pages=2, 6 \n |url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?page=2 \n |title=The History of Civilization \n |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] \n |accessdate=January 20, 2014 \n |deadurl=no \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531030014/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?page=2 \n |archivedate=May 31, 2008 \n}}</ref>\n\nMeier and Shelley neared the end of their development and started presenting the game to the rest of MicroProse for feedback towards publication. This process was slowed by the current vice president of development, who had taken over Meier's former position at the company. This vice president did not receive any financial bonuses for successful publication of Meier's games due to Meier's contract terms, forgoing any incentive to provide the needed resources to finish the game.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> The management had also expressed issue with the lack of a firm completion date, as according to Shelley, Meier would consider a game completed only when he felt he had completed it.<ref name=\"vb shelley\"/> Eventually the two got the required help for publication, with Shelley overseeing these processes and Meier making the necessary coding changes.<ref name=\"vb shelley\">{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/25/how-bruce-shelley-brought-a-board-gamers-view-to-designing-civilization/ |title=How Bruce Shelley brought a board gamer\u2019s view into designing Civilization |first=Dean |last=Takahashi |date=February 25, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |work=[[Venture Beat]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826055618/http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/25/how-bruce-shelley-brought-a-board-gamers-view-to-designing-civilization/ |archivedate=August 26, 2016 }}</ref> Playtesting revealed that their chosen map size was too large and made for boring and repetitive gameplay.

In 1991, Internet or online gaming was still in its infancy, so this option was not considered in ''Civilization''{{'}}s release.<ref name=\"cgw199307\"/> Over the next few years, as home Internet accessibility took off, MicroProse looked to develop an online version of ''Civilization''. This led to the 1995 release of ''Sid Meier's CivNet''. ''CivNet'' allowed for up to eight players to play the game, with computer opponents available to obtain up to eight active civilizations. Games could be played either on a turn-based mode, or in a simultaneous mode where each player took their turn at the same time and only progressing to the next turn once all players have confirmed being finished that turn. The game, in addition to better support for [[Windows 3.1]] and [[Windows 95]], supported connectivity through [[Local area network|LAN]], primitive Internet play,  modem, and direct serial link, and included a local [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|hotseat]] mode. ''CivNet'' also included a map editor and a \"king builder\" to allow a player to customize the names and looks of their civilization as seen by other players.<ref name=\"gamespot civnet\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Brian Reynolds (game designer)|Brian Reynolds]], who led the development of ''[[Civilization II]]'', MicroProse \"sincerely believed that ''CivNet'' was going to be a much more important product\" than the next single-player ''Civilization'' game that he and [[Jeff Briggs]] had started working on. Reynolds said that because their project was seen as a side effort with little risk, they were able to innovate new ideas into ''Civilization II''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/02/remembering-civilization-2-20-years-on/ |title=Remembering Civilization 2, 20 Years On |first=Alex |last=Walker |date=February 4, 2016 |accessdate=October 4, 2016 |work=[[Kotaku]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160929234101/http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/02/remembering-civilization-2-20-years-on/ |archivedate=September 29, 2016 }}</ref> As a net result, ''CivNet'' was generally overshadowed by ''[[Civilization II]]'' which was released in the following year.<ref name=\"gamespot civnet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/civnet-review/1900-2558586/ |title=CivNet Review |first=Trent |last=Ward |date=May 1, 1996 |accessdate=September 23, 2016 |work=[[GameSpot]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130033117/http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/civnet-review/1900-2558586/ |archivedate=November 30, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Post-release===\n''Civilization''{{'}}s critical success created a \"golden period of MicroProse\" where there was more potential for similar strategy games to succeed, according to Meier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2016/02/18/civilization-25-years-66-versions-33m-copies-sold-1-billion-hours-played/ |title=Civilization: 25 years, 33M copies sold, 1 billion hours played, and 66 versions |first=Dean |last=Takahasi |date=February 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 21, 2016 |work=[[Venture Beat]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826055444/http://venturebeat.com/2016/02/18/civilization-25-years-66-versions-33m-copies-sold-1-billion-hours-played/ |archivedate=August 26, 2016 }}</ref> This put stress on the company's direction and culture.

This game was released in early 1996, and is considered the first sequel of any Sid Meier game.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/> Stealey eventually sold his shares in MicroProse and left the company, and Spectrum HoloByte opted to consolidate the two companies under the name MicroProse in 1996, eliminating numerous positions at MicroProse in the process. As a result, Meier, Briggs, and Reynolds all opted to leave the company and founded [[Firaxis]], which by 2005 became a subsidiary of [[Take-Two]]. After a number of acquisitions and legal actions, the ''Civilization'' brand (both as a board game and video game) is now owned by Take-Two, and Firaxis, under Meier's oversight, continues to develop games in the ''Civilization'' series.<ref name=\"gamasutra\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n|Allgame = {{rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite web|last=Knight |first=Kyle |url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=20216&tab=review |title=Sid Meier's Civilization - Review for PC |publisher=Allgame.com |date=October 3, 2010 |accessdate=November 6, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141115032525/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=20216&tab=review |archivedate=November 15, 2014 }}</ref>\n|GR =\n|GI = 8.5/10 (SNES)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19971120012730/http://www.gameinformer.com/oct95/civ.htm Sid Meier's Civilization - SNES], October 1995 Issue, GameInformer.com (archived)</ref>\n|rev1 = ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''\n|rev1Score = {{rating|4|5}} (SNES)<ref name=\"NGen10\"/>\n}}\n\n''Civilization'' has been called one of the most important [[strategy game]]s of all time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/110068/the-52-most-important-video-games-of-all-time-page-4-of-8/|title=The 52 Most Important Video Games|publisher=[[GamePro]]|accessdate=May 21, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913085022/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/110068/the-52-most-important-video-games-of-all-time-page-4-of-8/ |archivedate=September 13, 2008}}</ref> and has a loyal following of fans.

The blend of exploration, economics, conquest and diplomacy is augmented by the quintessential research and development model, as you struggle to erect the Pyramids, discover gunpowder, and launch a colonization spacecraft to ''Alpha Centauri''. For its day, ''Civilization'' had the toughest computer opponents around - even taking into account the \"cheats\", that in most instances added rather than detracted from the game.

Meier noted that this resulted from not anticipating how players would use units, expecting them to have used their forces more like a war-based board game to protect borders and maintain zones of control rather than creating \"stacks of doom\". Future civilization games have had many changes in combat systems to prevent such oddities, though these games do allow for such random victories.<ref name=\"arstech gdc2017\" />\n\nThe 1999 game ''[[Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri]]'' was also created by Meier and is in the same genre, but with a futuristic/space theme; many of the interface and gameplay innovations in this game eventually made their way into ''Civilization III'' and ''IV''. ''Alpha Centauri'' is not actually a sequel to ''Civilization'', despite beginning with the same event that ends ''Civilization'' and ''Civilization II'': a manned spacecraft from Earth arrives in the [[Alpha Centauri]] star system.

He is sometimes seen as the first [[Impressionism in music|Impressionist]] composer, although he rejected the term. He was among the most influential composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBorn to a family of modest means and little cultural involvement, Debussy showed enough musical talent to be admitted at the age of ten to France's leading music college, the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. He originally studied the piano, but found his vocation in innovative composition, despite the disapproval of the Conservatoire's conservative professors. He took many years to develop his mature style, and was nearly 40 before achieving international fame in 1902 with the only opera he completed, ''[[Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (opera)|Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande]]''.\n\nDebussy's orchestral works include ''[[Pr\u00e9lude \u00e0 l'apr\u00e8s-midi d'un faune]]'' (1894), ''[[Nocturnes (Debussy)|Nocturnes]]'' (1897\u20131899) and ''[[Images pour orchestre|Images]]'' (1905\u20131912). His music was to a considerable extent a reaction against [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and the German musical tradition. He regarded the classical [[symphony]] as obsolete and sought an alternative in his \"symphonic sketches\", ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'' (1903\u20131905). His piano works include two books of [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|Pr\u00e9ludes]] and two of [[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|\u00c9tudes]]. Throughout his career he wrote ''[[m\u00e9lodie]]s'' based on a wide variety of poetry, including his own. He was greatly influenced by the [[Symbolist]] poetic movement of the later 19th century. A small number of works, including the early ''[[La Damoiselle \u00e9lue]]'' and the late ''[[Le Martyre de saint S\u00e9bastien]]'' have important parts for chorus. In his final years, he focused on chamber music, completing three of six planned sonatas for different combinations of instruments.\n\nWith early influences including Russian and far-eastern music, Debussy developed his own style of harmony and orchestral colouring, derided''\u2013''and unsuccessfully resisted''\u2013''by much of the musical establishment of the day. His works have strongly influenced a wide range of composers including [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], [[Olivier Messiaen]], [[George Benjamin (composer)|George Benjamin]], and the jazz pianist and composer [[Bill Evans]]. Debussy died from [[colorectal cancer|cancer]] at his home in Paris at the age of 55 after a composing career of a little more than 30 years.\n\n== Life and career ==\n[[File:Maison natale de Debussy.jpg|alt=Old postcard showing French street scene in a not very upmarket area|thumb|upright|Rue au Pain, [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], where Debussy was born]]\n=== Early life ===\nDebussy  was born on 22 August 1862 in [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], [[Seine-et-Oise]], on the north-west fringes of Paris.<ref>Lockspeiser, p. 6; and Trezise (2003), p. xiv</ref>{{refn|Debussy\u2019s birthplace is now a museum dedicated to him.

Imperialism here refers to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between [[civilization]]s, favoring the more powerful civilization. Thus, cultural imperialism is the practice of promoting and imposing a culture, usually that of a politically powerful [[nation]], over a less powerful society; in other words, the [[cultural hegemony]] of [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] or [[Developed country|economically influential countries]] which determine general cultural values and standardize civilizations throughout the world. The term is employed especially in the fields of history, [[cultural studies]], and [[postcolonial theory]]. It is usually used in a pejorative sense, often in conjunction with calls to reject such influence. Cultural imperialism can take various forms, such as an attitude, a formal policy, or military action, insofar as it reinforces cultural hegemony.\n\n==Background and definitions==\nAlthough the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has a 1921 reference to the \"cultural imperialism of the Russians\",<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', within \"cultural\"</ref> John Tomlinson, in his book on the subject, writes that the term emerged in the 1960s<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0CFMS0z5-gcC&dq=cultural+imperialism&q=%221960s+and+has%22#v=snippet&q=%221960s%20and%20has%22&f=false Tomlinson (1991)], p. 2</ref> and has been a focus of research since at least the 1970s.<ref>Hamm, (2005), p. 4</ref> Terms such as \"[[media imperialism]]\", \"structural imperialism\", \"cultural dependency and domination\",  \"cultural synchronization\", \"[[electronic colonialism]]\", \"ideological imperialism\", and \"[[economic imperialism]]\" have all been used to describe the same basic notion of cultural imperialism.<ref name=\"White\"/>\n\nVarious academics give various definitions of the term. American [[media critic]] [[Herbert Schiller]] wrote: \"The concept of cultural imperialism today [1975] best describes the sum of the processes by which a society is brought into the modern world system and how its dominating stratum is attracted, pressured, forced, and sometimes bribed into shaping social institutions to correspond to, or even promote, the values and structures of the dominating centre of the system. The public media are the foremost example of operating enterprises that are used in the penetrative process. For penetration on a significant scale the media themselves must be captured by the dominating/penetrating power. This occurs largely through the commercialization of broadcasting.\"<ref name=\"Schiller 76\">{{cite book|last=Schiller|first=Herbert I.|title=Communication and cultural domination|publisher=International Arts and Sciences Press, 901 North Broadway, White Plains, New York 10603 |year=1976|pages=9\u201310|isbn=978-0-87332-079-5}}</ref>\n\n[[Tom McPhail]] defined \"Electronic colonialism as the dependency relationship established by the importation of communication hardware, foreign-produced software, along with engineers, technicians, and related information protocols, that vicariously establish a set of foreign norms, values, and expectations which, in varying degrees, may alter the domestic cultures and socialization processes.\"<ref name=\"McPhail\">{{cite book|last=McPhail|first=Thomas L.|title=Electronic colonialism: the future of international broadcasting and communication|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1987|series=Volume 126 of Sage library of social research|page=18|isbn=978-0-8039-2730-8}}</ref> Sui-Nam Lee observed that \"communication imperialism can be defined as the process in which the ownership and control over the hardware and software of mass media as well as other major forms of communication in one country are singly or together subjugated to the domination of another country with deleterious effects on the indigenous values, norms and culture.\"<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite journal|last=Lee |first=Siu-Nam Lee |year=1988|title=Communication imperialism and dependency: A conceptual clarification|journal=International Communication Gazette|publisher=Kiuwer Academic Publishers|location=Netherlands|issue= 41|page=74}}</ref>  Ogan saw \"media imperialism often described as a process whereby the United States and Western Europe produce most of the media products, make the first profits from domestic sales, and then market the products in Third World countries at costs considerably lower than those the countries would have to bear to produce similar products at home.\"<ref name=\"Ogan\">{{cite journal|last=Ogan|first=Christine|date=Spring 1988|title=Media Imperialism and the Videocassette Recorder: The Case of Turkey|journal=Journal of Communication|volume= 38|issue= 2|page=94|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1988.tb02049.x}}</ref>\n\nDowning and Sreberny-Mohammadi state: \"Imperialism is the conquest and control of one country by a more powerful one.

(ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press</ref> According to Foucault, power is intimately tied with his conception of [[truth]]. \"Truth\", as he defines it, is a \"system of ordered procedures for the production, regulation, distribution, circulation, and operation of statements\" which has a \"circular relation\" with systems of power.<ref>Foucault, Michel. 1979. \"Truth and Power\" in Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press</ref> Therefore, inherent in systems of power, is always \"truth\", which is culturally specific, inseparable from [[ideology]] which often coincides with various forms of [[hegemony]]. ''Cultural imperialism'' may be an example of this.\n\nFoucault's interpretation of governance is also very important in constructing theories of transnational power structure.  In his lectures at the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], Foucault often defines governmentality as the broad art of \"governing\", which goes beyond the traditional conception of governance in terms of state mandates, and into other realms such as governing \"a household, souls, children, a province, a convent, a religious order, a family\".<ref>Foucault, Michel. 1978. \"Governmentality\" in  Faubion, James D. (ed.) ''Essential Works of Foucault, Volume 3: Power'' New York: The New Press</ref> This relates directly back to Machiavelli's [[The Prince]], and Foucault's aforementioned conceptions of [[truth]] and [[Power (philosophy)|power]]. (i.e. various [[Subjectivity|subjectivities]] are created through power relations that are culturally specific, which lead to various forms of culturally specific governmentality such as [[neoliberal]] governmentality.)\n\n===Edward Sa\u00efd===\nInformed by the works of [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault, and [[Antonio Gramsci]], Edward Sa\u00efd is a founding figure of postcolonialism, established with the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), a [[Humanism|humanist]] critique of [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]], which criticizes Western knowledge of \"The East\"\u2014specifically the English and the French [[Social construct|constructions]] of what is and what is not \"Oriental\".<ref>Robert Young, ''White Mythologies: Writing History and the West'', New York & London: Routledge, 1990.</ref><ref>[http://www.counterpunch.org/said08052003.html Orientalism 25 Years Later, by Said in 2003]</ref><ref name=\"Orientalism\">Sa\u00efd, Edward. 1978.

Because of this, Spivak argues that the [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]], referring to the communities that participate in the Sati, are not able to represent themselves through their own voice. Spivak says that cultural imperialism has the power to disqualify or erase the knowledge and mode of education of certain populations that are low on the social hierarchy.<ref name=speak />\n\nThroughout \"Can the Subaltern Speak?\", Spivak cites the works of Karl Marx, Michel Foucault, Walter Benjamin, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, and Edward Said, among others.\n\nIn ''A critique of Postcolonial Reason'', Spivak argues that Western philosophy has a history of not only exclusion of the subaltern from discourse, but also does not allow them to occupy the space of a fully human subject.\n\n==Contemporary ideas and debate==\n''Cultural imperialism'' can refer to either the forced acculturation of a subject population, or to the voluntary embracing of a foreign culture by individuals who do so of their own free will.  Since these are two very different referents, the validity of the term has been called into question.\n\nCultural influence can be seen by the \"receiving\" culture as either a threat to or an enrichment of its [[cultural identity]]. It seems therefore useful to distinguish between cultural imperialism as an (active or passive) attitude of superiority, and the position of a culture or group that seeks to complement its own cultural production, considered partly deficient, with imported products.\n\nThe imported products or services can themselves represent, or be associated with, certain values (such as [[consumerism]]). According to one argument, the \"receiving\" [[culture]] does not necessarily perceive this link, but instead absorbs the foreign culture passively through the use of the foreign goods and services. Due to its somewhat concealed, but very potent nature, this hypothetical idea is described by some experts as \"''banal imperialism''.\" For example, it is argued that while \"American companies are accused of wanting to control 95 percent of the world's consumers\", \"cultural imperialism involves much more than simple consumer goods; it involved the dissemination of American principles such as freedom and democracy\", a process which \"may sound appealing\" but which \"masks a frightening truth: many cultures around the world are disappearing due to the overwhelming influence of corporate and cultural America\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations |year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|page=31|edition=2nd|author2=Cynthia King}}</ref>\n\nSome believe that the newly globalised economy of the late 20th and early 21st century has facilitated this process through the use of new information technology.  This kind of cultural imperialism is derived from what is called \"[[soft power]]\". The theory of electronic colonialism extends the issue to global cultural issues and the impact of major multi-media conglomerates, ranging from [[Viacom]], [[Time-Warner]], [[Disney]], [[News Corp]], to [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] with the focus on the hegemonic power of these mainly United States-based communication giants.\n\n===Cultural diversity===\nOne of the reasons often given for opposing any form of cultural imperialism, voluntary or otherwise, is the preservation of [[cultural diversity]], a goal seen by some as analogous to the preservation of [[biodiversity|ecological diversity]].  Proponents of this idea argue either that such diversity is valuable in itself, to preserve human historical heritage and knowledge, or instrumentally valuable because it makes available more ways of solving problems and responding to catastrophes, natural or otherwise.\n\n===Ideas relating to African colonization===\nOf all the areas of the world that scholars have claimed to be adversely affected by imperialism, Africa is probably the most notable. In the expansive \"age of imperialism\" of the nineteenth century, scholars have argued that European colonization in Africa has led to the elimination of many various cultures, worldviews, and [[Epistemology|epistemologies]], particularly through neocolonization of public education.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/sabrin_mohammed_201305_phd.pdf|title=EXPLORING THE INTELLECTUAL FOUNDATIONS OF EGYPTIAN NATIONAL EDUCATION|last=Sabrin|first=Mohammed|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>Monga, C. 1996.

Critics of neoliberalism, at times, claim that it is the newly predominant form of imperialism.<ref name=Abdi /> Other Scholars, such as Elizabeth Dunn and Julia Elyachar have claimed that [[neoliberalism]] requires and creates its own form of [[governmentality]].<ref name=Dunn>Dunn, Elizabeth C. 2004.

For example, Chandra Mohanty has critiqued Western [[feminism]], claiming that it has created a misrepresentation of the \"third world woman\" as being completely powerless, unable to resist male dominance.<ref name=Mohanty>Mohanty, Chandra. 1988. \"Under Western Eyes: Feminist Scholarship and Colonial Discourses\" ''Feminist Review'' no. 30</ref> Thus, this leads to the often critiqued narrative of the \"white man\" saving the \"brown woman\" from the \"brown man.\" Other, more radical critiques of [[development studies]], have to do with the field of study itself. Some scholars even question the intentions of those developing the field of study, claiming that efforts to \"develop\" the [[Global South]] were never about the South itself. Instead, these efforts, it is argued, were made in order to advance Western development and reinforce Western hegemony.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dossa | first1 = Shiraz | year = 2007 | title = Slicing Up 'Development': Colonialism, political theory, ethics | url = | journal = Third World Quarterly | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 887\u2013899 | doi=10.1080/01436590701371595}}</ref>\n\n===Ties to media effects studies===\nThe core of cultural imperialism thesis is integrated with the political-economy traditional approach in media effects research. Critics of cultural imperialism commonly claim that non-Western cultures, particularly from the Third World, will forsake their traditional values and lose their cultural identities when they are solely exposed to Western media. Nonetheless, Michael B. Salwen, in his book ''Critical Studies in Mass Communication'' (1991),<ref>Salwen, Michael B. 1991. \"Cultural Imperialism: A Media Effects Approach.\" Critical Studies In Mass Communication 8, no. 1: 29. Communication & Mass Media Complete, EBSCOhost</ref> claims that cross-consideration and integration of empirical findings on cultural imperialist influences is very critical in terms of understanding mass media in the international sphere. He recognizes both of contradictory contexts on cultural imperialist impacts. \nThe first context is where cultural imperialism imposes socio-political disruptions on developing nations. Western media can distort images of foreign cultures and provoke personal and social conflicts to developing nations in some cases.<ref>Tan, A.s., Tan, G. K., & Tan. A.S. (1987), American TV in the Philippines: A test of cultural impact. Journalism Quarterly</ref> \nAnother context is that peoples in developing nations resist to foreign media and preserve their cultural attitudes. Although he admits that outward manifestations of Western culture may be adopted, but the fundamental values and behaviors remain still. Furthermore, positive effects might occur when male-dominated cultures adopt the \u201cliberation\u201d of women with exposure to Western media<ref>Kang, J. G., & Morgan, M. (1988). Culture clash: Impact of U.S. television in Korea. Journalism Quarterly</ref> and it stimulates ample exchange of cultural exchange.<ref>Sparkes, V. (1977). TV across the Canadian border: Does it matter? Journal of Communication,</ref>\n\n===Criticisms of \"cultural imperialism theory\"===\nCritics of scholars who discuss cultural imperialism have a number of critiques. ''Cultural imperialism'' is a term that is only used in discussions where [[cultural relativism]] and [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] are generally taken as true. (One cannot critique promoting Western values if one believes that said values are absolutely correct. Similarly, one cannot argue that Western epistemology is unjustly promoted in non-Western societies if one believes that those epistemologies are absolutely correct.<ref name=\"White\" />) Therefore, those who disagree with cultural relativism and/or constructivism may critique the employment of the term, ''cultural imperialism'' on those terms.\n\nJohn Tomlinson provides a critique of cultural imperialism theory and reveals major problems in the way in which the idea of cultural, as opposed to economic or political, imperialism is formulated. In his book ''Cultural Imperialism: A Critical Introduction'', he delves into the much debated \u201c[[media imperialism]]\u201d theory. Summarizing research on the Third World\u2019s reception of American television shows, he challenges the cultural imperialism argument, conveying his doubts about the degree to which US shows in developing nations actually carry US values and improve the profits of US companies. Tomlinson suggests that cultural imperialism is growing in some respects, but local transformation and interpretations of imported media products propose that cultural diversification is not at an end in global society.<ref>Lechner, Frank J. and Boli, John (2009). ''The Globalization Reader'' (4th ed), Wiley-Blackwell. p.341</ref> He explains that one of the fundamental conceptual mistakes of cultural imperialism is to take for granted that the distribution of cultural goods can be considered as cultural dominance. He thus supports his argument highly criticizing the concept that [[Americanization]] is occurring through global overflow of American television products. He points to a myriad of examples of television networks who have managed to dominate their domestic markets and that domestic programs generally top the ratings. He also doubts the concept that cultural agents are passive receivers of information. He states that movement between cultural/geographical areas always involves translation, mutation, adaptation, and the creation of hybridity.\n\nOther major critiques are that the term is not defined well, and employs further terms that are not defined well, and therefore lacks explanatory power, that ''cultural imperialism'' is hard to measure, and that the theory of a legacy of [[colonialism]] is not always true.<ref name=\"White\" />\n\n===Rothkopf on dealing with cultural dominance===\n[[David Rothkopf]], managing director of [[Kissinger Associates]] and an adjunct professor of [[international relations|international affairs]] at [[Columbia University]] (who also served as a senior [[US Commerce Department]] official in the [[Clinton Administration]]), wrote about cultural imperialism in his provocatively titled ''In Praise of Cultural Imperialism?'' in the summer 1997 issue of ''[[Foreign Policy]]'' magazine. Rothkopf says that the United States should embrace \"cultural imperialism\" as in its self-interest. But his definition of cultural imperialism stresses spreading the values of [[Toleration|tolerance]] and openness to cultural change in order to avoid war and conflict between cultures as well as expanding accepted technological and legal standards to provide free traders with enough security to do business with more countries. Rothkopf's definition almost exclusively involves allowing individuals in other nations to accept or reject foreign cultural influences. He also mentions, but only in passing, the use of the [[English language]] and consumption of news and popular music and film as cultural dominance that he supports. Rothkopf additionally makes the point that [[globalization]] and the [[Internet]] are accelerating the process of cultural influence.<ref name=rothkopf>Rothkopf, David, [http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm \"In Praise of Cultural Imperialism\"], ''Foreign Affairs'', Summer 1997, Volume 107, pp. 38\u201353; all descriptions of Rothkopf's points and his quotes are from this article {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081117105019/http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/cultural/globcult.htm |date=17 November 2008 }}</ref>\n\nCulture is sometimes used by the organizers of society\u2014politicians, theologians, academics, and families\u2014to impose and ensure order, the rudiments of which change over time as need dictates. One need only look at the 20th century's [[genocide]]s. In each one, leaders used culture as a political front to fuel the passions of their armies and other minions and to justify their actions among their people.\n\nRothkopf then cites genocide and [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacre]]s in [[Armenia]], Russia, the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], [[Cambodia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Rwanda]] and [[East Timor]] as examples of culture (in some cases expressed in the ideology of \"political culture\" or religion) being misused to justify violence. He also acknowledges that cultural imperialism in the past has been guilty of forcefully eliminating the cultures of natives in the Americas and in Africa, or through use of the [[Inquisition]], ''\"and during the expansion of virtually every [[empire]].\"''.The most important way to deal with cultural influence in any nation, according to Rothkopf, is to promote tolerance and allow, or even promote, cultural diversities that are compatible with tolerance and to eliminate those cultural differences that cause violent conflict:\n\n:Successful multicultural societies, be they nations, federations, or other conglomerations of closely interrelated states, discern those aspects of culture that do not threaten union, stability, or prosperity (such as food, holidays, rituals, and music) and allow them to flourish. But they counteract or eradicate the more subversive elements of culture (exclusionary aspects of religion, language, and political/ideological beliefs). History shows that bridging cultural gaps successfully and serving as a home to diverse peoples requires certain social structures, laws, and institutions that transcend culture. Furthermore, the history of a number of ongoing experiments in [[multiculturalism]], such as in the European Union, India, South Africa, Canada and the United States, suggests that workable, if not perfected, integrative models exist. Each is built on the idea that tolerance is crucial to social well-being, and each at times has been threatened by both intolerance and a heightened emphasis on cultural distinctions. The greater public good warrants eliminating those cultural characteristics that promote conflict or prevent harmony, even as less-divisive, more personally observed cultural distinctions are celebrated and preserved.<ref>{{Cite book  | last1 = O'Meara | first1 = Patrick. | last2 = Mehlinger | first2 = Howard D. | last3 = Krain | first3 = Matthew. | title = Globalization and the challenges of a new century : a reader | year = 2000 | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington, Ind. | isbn = 978-0-253-21355-6 | pages = 445\u2013446 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLwlnhq01RIC&dq=Globalization+and+the+challenges&q=445+chinese#v=snippet&q=445%20chinese&f=false}}</ref>\n\nCultural dominance can also be seen in the 1930s in Australia where the Aboriginal Assimilation Policy acted as an attempt to wipe out the Native Australian people.

[[Nuclear chemistry]] is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes can occur.\n\nThe substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called [[reagent|reactants or reagents]]. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a [[chemical change]], and they yield one or more [[Product (chemistry)|products]], which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called [[elementary reaction]]s, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the [[reaction mechanism]]. Chemical reactions are described with [[chemical equation]]s, which symbolically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.\n\nChemical reactions happen at a characteristic [[reaction rate]] at a given temperature and chemical concentration. Typically, reaction rates increase with increasing temperature because there is more [[thermal energy]] available to reach the activation energy necessary for breaking bonds between atoms.\n\nReactions may proceed in the forward or reverse direction until they go to completion or reach equilibrium. Reactions that proceed in the forward direction to approach equilibrium are often described as [[Spontaneous process|spontaneous]], requiring no input of free energy to go forward. Non-spontaneous reactions require input of free energy to go forward (examples include charging a battery by applying an external electrical power source, or photosynthesis driven by absorption of electromagnetic radiation in the form of sunlight).\n\nDifferent chemical reactions are used in combinations during [[chemical synthesis]] in order to obtain a desired product. In [[biochemistry]], a consecutive series of chemical reactions (where the product of one reaction is the reactant of the next reaction) form [[metabolic pathway]]s. These reactions are often [[catalysis|catalyzed]] by protein [[enzyme]]s. Enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that [[metabolism|metabolic]] syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions can occur at the temperatures and concentrations present within a [[Cell (biology)|cell]].\n\nThe general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including [[nuclear reactions]], [[radioactive decay]]s, and reactions between [[elementary particle]]s, as described by [[quantum field theory]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Antoine lavoisier color.jpg|thumb|[[Antoine Lavoisier]] developed the theory of combustion as a chemical reaction with oxygen.]]\n\nChemical reactions such as combustion in fire, [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the [[Classical element|Four-Element Theory]] of [[Empedocles]] stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements \u2013 fire, water, air and earth. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by [[Alchemy|Alchemists]]. They attempted, in particular, to convert [[lead]] into [[gold]], for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with [[sulfur]].<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ciuz.19730070604| title = Neuere Interpretationsm\u00f6glichkeiten der Alchemie| journal = Chemie in unserer Zeit| volume = 7| issue = 6| pages = 177\u2013181| year = 1973| last1 = Weyer | first1 = J. }}</ref>\n\nThe production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried, such as the synthesis of [[sulfuric acid|sulfuric]] and [[nitric acid]]s attributed to the controversial alchemist [[J\u0101bir ibn Hayy\u0101n]]. The process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as [[copper sulfate]], [[alum]] and [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]]. In the 17th century, [[Johann Rudolph Glauber]] produced [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium sulfate]] by reacting sulfuric acid and [[sodium chloride]]. With the development of the [[lead chamber process]] in 1746 and the [[Leblanc process]], allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and [[sodium carbonate]], respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry.

It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called \"phlogiston\", which was contained within combustible bodies and released during [[combustion]].

Based on this idea and the atomic theory of [[John Dalton]], [[Joseph Proust]] had developed the [[law of definite proportions]], which later resulted in the concepts of [[stoichiometry]] and [[chemical equation]]s.<ref>[[#Brock|Brock]], pp. 104\u2013107</ref>\n\nRegarding the [[organic chemistry]], it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained [[Chemical synthesis|synthetically]]. According to the concept of [[vitalism]], organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\" and distinguished from inorganic materials. This separation was ended however by the synthesis of [[urea]] from inorganic precursors by [[Friedrich W\u00f6hler]] in 1828. Other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include [[Alexander William Williamson]] with his [[Williamson ether synthesis|synthesis]] of [[ether]]s and [[Christopher Kelk Ingold]], who, among many discoveries, established the mechanisms of [[substitution reaction]]s.\n\n==Equations==\n[[File:Combustion reaction of methane.jpg|thumb|450px|As seen from the equation {{chem|CH|4}} + 2 {{chem|O|2}} \u2192 {{chem|CO|2}} + 2 {{chem|H|2|O}}, a coefficient of 2 must be placed before the [[oxygen]] gas on the reactants side and before the [[properties of water|water]] on the products side in order for, as per the law of conservation of mass, the quantity of each element does not change during the reaction]]\n\n{{main|Chemical equation}}\n\n[[Chemical equation]]s are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions.

A double arrow ({{eqm}}) pointing in opposite directions is used for [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium reaction]]s.

Only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the [[cis\u2013trans isomerism|cis\u2013trans]] [[isomerization]], in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa.<ref name=rh/>\n\nIn a typical [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] reaction, a bond in a molecule splits ('''ruptures''') resulting in two molecular fragments. The splitting can be [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] or [[Heterolysis (chemistry)|heterolytic]]. In the first case, the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]]. In the second case, both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products, resulting in charged [[ion]]s. Dissociation plays an important role in triggering [[chain reaction]]s, such as [[Oxyhydrogen|hydrogen\u2013oxygen]] or [[polymerization]] reactions.\n\n:<chem>AB -> A + B</chem>\n: <small> Dissociation of a molecule AB into fragments A and B </small>\n\nFor bimolecular reactions, two molecules collide and react with each other. Their merger is called [[chemical synthesis]] or an [[addition reaction]].\n:<chem>A + B -> AB</chem>\nAnother possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and acid-base reactions. In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton. This type of reaction is also called [[Metathesis reaction|metathesis]].\n:<chem>HA + B -> A + HB</chem>\nfor example\n:<chem>NaCl + AgNO3 -> NaNO3 + AgCl(v)</chem>\n\n==Chemical equilibrium==\n{{Main|Chemical equilibrium}}\nMost chemical reactions are reversible, that is they can and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in [[Chemical kinetics|reaction rates]]. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature, pressure and the materials involved, and is determined by the [[Principle of minimum energy|minimum free energy]]. In equilibrium, the [[Gibbs free energy]] must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the [[Le Chatelier's principle]]. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas.<ref>[[#Atkins|Atkins]], p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe reaction yield stabilizes at equilibrium, but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or changed by increasing the temperature or pressure. A change in the concentrations of the reactants does not affect the equilibrium constant, but does affect the equilibrium position.\n\n==Thermodynamics==\nChemical reactions are determined by the laws of [[thermodynamics]]. Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are [[exergonic]], that is if they release energy. The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, [[enthalpy]] and [[entropy]]:<ref>[[#Atkins|Atkins]], pp. 106\u2013108</ref>\n\n:; <math>\\Delta G = \\Delta H - T \\cdot \\Delta S</math>.\n:: <small> {{mvar|G}}: free energy, {{mvar|H}}: enthalpy, {{mvar|T}}: temperature, {{mvar|S}}: entropy, {{math|\u0394}}: difference(change between original and product) </small>\n\nReactions can be [[Exothermic reaction|exothermic]], where \u0394H is negative and energy is released. Typical examples of exothermic reactions are [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] and [[crystallization]], in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases. In contrast, in [[endothermic]] reactions, heat is consumed from the environment. This can occur by increasing the entropy of the system, often through the formation of gaseous reaction products, which have high entropy. Since the entropy increases with temperature, many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures. On the contrary, many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures. Changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the sign of the enthalpy of a reaction, as for the [[carbon monoxide]] reduction of [[molybdenum dioxide]]:\n:<chem>2CO(g) + MoO2(s) -> 2CO2(g) + Mo(s)</chem>; <math>\\Delta H^o = +21.86 \\ \\text{kJ at 298 K}</math>\nThis reaction to form [[carbon dioxide]] and [[molybdenum]] is endothermic at low temperatures, becoming less so with increasing temperature.<ref name=\"ReacWeb\">[http://www.crct.polymtl.ca/reacweb.htm Reaction Web]</ref> \u0394H\u00b0 is zero at {{val|1855|ul=K}}, and the reaction becomes exothermic above that temperature.\n\nChanges in temperature can also reverse the direction tendency of a reaction. For example, the [[water gas shift reaction]]\n:<chem>CO(g) + H2O({v}) <=> CO2(g) + H2(g)</chem>\nis favored by low temperatures, but its reverse is favored by high temperature. The shift in reaction direction tendency occurs at {{val|1100|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ReacWeb\" />\n\nReactions can also be characterized by the [[internal energy]] which takes into account changes in the entropy, volume and [[chemical potential]]. The latter depends, among other things, on the [[activity (chemistry)|activities]] of the involved substances.<ref>[[#Atkins|Atkins]], p. 150</ref>\n\n:; <math>{d}U = T\\cdot {d}S - p\\cdot {d}V + \\mu\\cdot {d}n</math>\n:: <small> {{mvar|U}}: internal energy, {{mvar|S}}: entropy, {{mvar|p}}: pressure, {{mvar|\u03bc}}: chemical potential, {{mvar|n}}: number of molecules, {{mvar|d}}: [[differential calculus|small change sign]] </small>\n\n==Kinetics==\nThe speed at which reactions takes place is studied by [[Chemical kinetics|reaction kinetics]]. The rate depends on various parameters, such as:\n\n*[[Reactant]] concentrations, which usually make the reaction happen at a faster rate if raised through increased collisions per unit time. Some reactions, however, have rates that are ''independent'' of reactant concentrations.  These are called [[Rate law#Zero-order reactions|zero order reactions]].\n*[[Surface area]] available for contact between the reactants, in particular solid ones in heterogeneous systems. Larger surface areas lead to higher reaction rates.\n*[[Pressure]] \u2013 increasing the pressure decreases the volume between molecules and therefore increases the frequency of collisions between the molecules.\n*[[Activation energy]], which is defined as the amount of energy required to make the reaction start and carry on spontaneously. Higher activation energy implies that the reactants need more energy to start than a reaction with a lower activation energy.\n*[[Temperature]], which hastens reactions if raised, since higher temperature increases the energy of the molecules, creating more collisions per unit time,\n*The presence or absence of a [[catalyst]]. Catalysts are substances which change the pathway (mechanism) of a reaction which in turn increases the speed of a reaction by lowering the [[activation energy]] needed for the reaction to take place. A catalyst is not destroyed or changed during a reaction, so it can be used again.\n*For some reactions, the presence of [[electromagnetic radiation]], most notably [[ultraviolet light]], is needed to promote the breaking of bonds to start the reaction.  This is particularly true for reactions involving [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]].\n\nSeveral theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level. This field is referred to as reaction dynamics. The rate ''v'' of a [[Rate equation#First-order reactions|first-order reaction]], which could be disintegration of a substance A, is given by:\n\n:<math chem> v= -\\frac {d[\\ce{A}]}{dt}= k \\cdot [\\ce{A}]. </math>\n\nIts integration yields:\n\n:<math chem>\\ce{[A]}(t) = \\ce{[A]}_{0} \\cdot e^{-k\\cdot t}. </math>\n\nHere k is first-order rate constant having dimension 1/time, [A](t) is concentration at a time ''t'' and [A]<sub>0</sub> is the initial concentration. The rate of a first-order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance, and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic [[half-life]]. More than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order. The temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the [[Arrhenius equation]]:\n\n:<math>k = k_0 e^{{-E_a}/{k_{B}T}}</math>\n\nwhere E<sub>a</sub> is the activation energy and k<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]]. One of the simplest models of reaction rate is the [[collision theory]]. More realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the [[transition state theory]], the calculation of the [[potential energy surface]], the [[Marcus theory]] and the [[RRKM theory|Rice\u2013Ramsperger\u2013Kassel\u2013Marcus (RRKM) theory]].<ref>[[#Atkins|Atkins]], p. 963</ref>\n\n==Reaction types==\n\n===Four basic types===\n[[File:Chemical reactions.svg|thumb|500px|Representation of four basic chemical reactions types: synthesis, decomposition, single replacement and double replacement.]]\n\n==== Synthesis ====\n{{Main|Synthesis reaction}}\nIn a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance.

One example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of [[iron]] and [[sulfur]] to form [[iron(II) sulfide]]:\n\n:<chem>8Fe + S8 -> 8FeS</chem>\n\nAnother example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance, such as water.<ref name=\"to react or not to react\">[http://utahscience.oremjr.alpine.k12.ut.us/sciber99/8th/matter/sciber/chemtype.htm To react or not to react?] Utah State Office of Education.

In this process, the former species is ''oxidized'' and the latter is ''reduced''. Though sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely correct. Oxidation is better defined as an increase in [[oxidation state]], and reduction as a decrease in oxidation state. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation state, but there are many reactions that are classed as \"redox\" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving [[covalent]] bonds).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | author = Glusker, Jenny P. |authorlink=Jenny Glusker| contribution = Structural Aspects of Metal Liganding to Functional Groups in Proteins | editor = Christian B.

On the other hand, the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of 0 (it is also a pure element) to \u22121: the chlorine gains one electron and is said to have been reduced. Because the chlorine is the one reduced, it is considered the electron acceptor, or in other words, induces oxidation in the sodium \u2013 thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent. Conversely, the sodium is oxidized or is the electron donor, and thus induces reduction in the other species and is considered the ''reducing agent''.\n\nWhich of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the [[electronegativity]] of their elements. Elements with low electronegativity, such as most metals, easily donate electrons and oxidize \u2013 they are reducing agents. On the contrary, many ions with high oxidation numbers, such as {{chem|link=hydrogen peroxide|H|2|O|2}}, {{chem|link=permanganate|MnO|4|-}}, {{chem|link=chromium trioxide|CrO|3}}, {{chem|link=dichromate|Cr|2|O|7|2-}}, {{chem|link=Osmium(VIII) oxide|OsO|4}} can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents.\n\nThe number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from the [[electron configuration]] of the reactant element. Elements try to reach the low-energy [[noble gas]] configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron respectively. Noble gases themselves are chemically inactive.<ref>[[#Wiberg|Wiberg]], pp. 289\u2013290</ref>\n\nAn important class of redox reactions are the [[Electrochemistry|electrochemical]] reactions, where electrons from the power supply are used as the reducing agent. These reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements, such as [[chlorine]]<ref>[[#Wiberg|Wiberg]], p. 409</ref> or [[aluminium]]. The reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and used in batteries.\n\n===Complexation===\n[[File:Ferrocene-from-xtal-3D-balls.png|160px|thumb|[[Ferrocene]] \u2013 an iron atom sandwiched between two C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>5</sub> [[ligand]]s]]\nIn complexation reactions, several [[ligand]]s react with a metal atom to form a [[coordination complex]]. This is achieved by providing [[lone pair]]s of the ligand into empty [[Atomic orbital|orbital]]s of the metal atom and forming [[dipolar bond]]s. The ligands are [[Lewis base]]s, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the [[18-electron rule]], saying that the [[valence shell]]s of a [[transition metal]] will collectively accommodate 18 [[electron]]s, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the [[crystal field theory]] and [[ligand field theory]]. Complexation reactions also include [[ligand exchange]], in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.<ref>[[#Wiberg|Wiberg]], pp. 1180\u20131205</ref>\n\n===Acid-base reactions===\nIn the [[Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory]], an [[acid-base reaction]] involves a transfer of [[proton]]s (H<sup>+</sup>) from one species (the [[acid]]) to another (the [[base (chemistry)|base]]). When a proton is removed from an acid, the resulting species is termed that acid's [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. When the proton is accepted by a base, the resulting species is termed that base's [[conjugate acid]].<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=conjugate acid\u2013base pair|file=C01266}}</ref> In other words, acids act as proton donors and bases act as proton acceptors according to the following equation:\n\n:<chem>\\underset{acid}{HA} + \\underset{base}{B} <=> \\underset{conjugated\\ base}{A^-} + \\underset{conjugated\\ acid}{HB+}</chem>\n\nThe reverse reaction is possible, and thus the acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined by the [[acid dissociation constant|acid and base dissociation constants]] (''K''<sub>a</sub> and ''K''<sub>b</sub>) of the involved substances. A special case of the acid-base reaction is the [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] where an acid and a base, taken at exactly same amounts, form a neutral [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]].\n\nAcid-base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid-base concept employed. Some of the most common are:\n*[[Acid-base#Arrhenius definition|Arrhenius]] definition: Acids dissociate in water releasing H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> ions; bases dissociate in water releasing OH<sup>\u2212</sup> ions.\n*[[Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory|Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry]] definition: Acids are proton (H<sup>+</sup>) donors, bases are proton acceptors; this includes the Arrhenius definition.\n*[[Acid-base#Lewis definition|Lewis]] definition: Acids are electron-pair acceptors, bases are electron-pair donors; this includes the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition.\n\n===Precipitation===\n[[File:Chemical precipitation diagram.svg|thumb|Precipitation]]\n[[Precipitation (chemistry)|Precipitation]] is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the [[solubility]] limit<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=precipitation|file=P04795}}</ref> and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an [[amorphous]] or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single [[crystal]]s. The latter can also be obtained by [[Recrystallization (chemistry)|recrystallization]] from microcrystalline salts.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | author = Wingender, J\u00f6rg | author2 = Ortanderl, Stefanie | contribution = Ausf\u00e4llung | title = R\u00f6mpp Chemie-Lexikon | publisher = [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]] | year = July 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Solid-state reactions===\nReactions can take place between two solids.

This exhaust converter is from a [[Peugeot 106]] S2 1100]]\n\nIn [[catalysis]], the reaction does not proceed directly, but through reaction with a third substance known as [[catalyst]]. Although the catalyst takes part in the reaction, it is returned to its original state by the end of the reaction and so is not consumed. However, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase ([[heterogeneous catalysis|heterogeneous]]) or in the same phase ([[homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous]]) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include [[coking]] where the catalyst becomes covered by [[polymer]]ic side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid\u2013liquid system or evaporate in a solid\u2013gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction \u2013 chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=catalyst|file=C00876}}</ref><ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=inhibitor|file=I03035}}</ref> Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.\n\nHeterogeneous catalysts are usually solids, powdered in order to maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the [[platinum group]] metals and other transition metals, which are used in [[hydrogenation]]s, [[catalytic reforming]] and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as [[nitric acid]] and [[ammonia]]. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of [[carbonyl]]s, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.<ref>{{cite book | author = Elschenbroich, Christoph | title = Organometallchemie | edition = 6th | publisher = [[Vieweg+Teubner Verlag]] | location = Wiesbaden | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-8351-0167-8 | page = 263}}</ref>\n\n==Reactions in organic chemistry==\n{{Main|Organic reaction}}\nIn organic chemistry, in addition to oxidation, reduction or acid-base reactions, a number of other reactions can take place which involve [[covalent bond]]s between carbon atoms or carbon and [[heteroatom]]s (such as oxygen, nitrogen, [[halogen]]s, etc.).

The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the [[leaving group]] departs with an electron pair. The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged. Examples of nucleophiles are [[hydroxide]] ion, [[alkoxide]]s, [[amine]]s and [[halide]]s. This type of reaction is found mainly in [[aliphatic hydrocarbon]]s, and rarely in [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]. The latter have high electron density and enter [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]] only with very strong [[Polar effect|electron withdrawing groups]]. Nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms, [[SN1 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>1]] and [[SN2 reaction|S<sub>N</sub>2]]. In their names, S stands for substitution, N for nucleophilic, and the number represents the [[order (chemistry)|kinetic order]] of the reaction, unimolecular or bimolecular.<ref>{{cite book | author = Hartshorn, S.

These two mechanisms differ in the [[stereochemistry]] of the products. S<sub>N</sub>1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center, but rather in a set of [[Cis\u2013trans isomerism|geometric isomers]] (''cis/trans''). In contrast, a reversal ([[Walden inversion]]) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the S<sub>N</sub>2 mechanism.<ref>[[#Bruckner|Br\u00fcckner]], pp. 63\u201377</ref>\n\n[[Electrophilic substitution]] is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule, an [[electrophile]], has low electron density and thus a positive charge. Typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of [[carbonyl group]]s, carbocations or [[sulfur]] or [[nitronium]] cations. This reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons, where it is called [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]. The electrophile attack results in the so-called \u03c3-complex, a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished. Then, the leaving group, usually a proton, is split off and the aromaticity is restored. An alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution. It is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types, S<sub>E</sub>1 and S<sub>E</sub>2<ref>[[#Bruckner|Br\u00fcckner]], pp. 203\u2013206</ref>\n\n[[File:Electrophilic aromatic substitution.svg|center|thumb|648px|Mechanism of electrophilic aromatic substitution]]\n{{clear}}\nIn the third type of substitution reaction, radical substitution, the attacking particle is a [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]].<ref name=jerry/> This process usually takes the form of a [[chain reaction]], for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens. In the first step, light or heat disintegrates the halogen-containing molecules producing the radicals. Then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine.<ref>[[#Bruckner|Br\u00fcckner]], p. 16</ref>\n:;<chem>X. + R-H -> X-H + R.</chem>\n:;<chem>R. + X2 -> R-X + X.</chem>\n::<small> Reactions during the chain reaction of radical substitution </small>\n\n===Addition and elimination===\nThe [[Addition reaction|addition]] and its counterpart, the [[elimination reaction|elimination]], are reactions which change the number of substituents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave [[covalent bond|multiple bond]]s. [[Double bond|Double]] and [[triple bond]]s can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next step, formation of the double bond, takes place with elimination of a proton ([[deprotonation]]). The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires participation of a base.<ref>[[#Bruckner|Br\u00fcckner]], p. 192</ref> Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the S<sub>N</sub>1 substitution.<ref>[[#Bruckner|Br\u00fcckner]], p. 183</ref>\n\n{{double image|center|E1-mechanism.svg|400|E1cb-mechanism.svg|400|E1 elimination |E1cb elimination}}\n{{clear}}\n[[File:E2-mechanism.svg|thumb|300px|E2 elimination]]\n\nThe E2 mechanism also requires a base, but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination is always in competition with the S<sub>N</sub>2-substitution.<ref>[[#Bruckner|Br\u00fcckner]], p. 172</ref>\n\n[[File:HBr-Addition.png|thumb|300px|Electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide]]\nThe counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds. Similar to the substitution reactions, there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle. For example, in the [[electrophilic addition]] of hydrogen bromide, an electrophile (proton) attacks the double bond forming a [[carbocation]], which then reacts with the nucleophile (bromine). The carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends, and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the [[Markovnikov's rule]].<ref>[[#Wiberg|Wiberg]], pp. 950, 1602</ref> This rule states that \"In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.\"<ref>{{GoldBookRef|title=Markownikoff rule|file=M03707}}</ref>\n\nIf the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond, then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible. In this case, one has to use the [[hydroboration\u2013oxidation reaction]], where in the first step, the [[boron]] atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom. At the second step, the nucleophilic [[hydroperoxide]] or halogen [[anion]] attacks the boron atom.<ref>[[#Bruckner|Br\u00fcckner]], p. 125</ref>\n\nWhile the addition to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the [[nucleophilic addition]] plays an important role for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the carbonyl group. This process is often associated with an elimination, so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again. It is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or anhydrides. This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.<ref>{{cite book | author = Latscha, Hans Peter | author2 = Kazmaier, Uli | author3 = Klein, Helmut Alfons | title = Organische Chemie: Chemie-basiswissen II | volume = 2 | edition = 6th | language = German | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-3-540-77106-7 | page = 273}}</ref>\n\n[[File:H-Add-El.Mechanismus.PNG|thumb|center|500px|Acid-catalyzed addition-elimination mechanism]]\n{{clear}}\n\n[[Nucleophilic addition]] of a [[carbanion]] or another [[nucleophile]] to the double bond of an [[\u0391,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl compound|alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compound]] can proceed via the [[Michael reaction]], which belongs to the larger class of [[conjugate addition]]s.

The reaction takes place in the [[active site]], a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by [[amino acid]] residues, and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization.

Relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of [[pH]] and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with [[ultrafast laser spectroscopy]] where utilization of [[Femtochemistry|femtosecond]] [[laser]]s allows short-lived transition states to be monitored at time

As such, it forms a unique natural canal between the Orinoco and [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] river systems.

In the dry season, it has shallows, and is obstructed by sandbanks, a few rapids and granite rocks. Its shores are densely wooded, and the soil more fertile than that along the Rio Negro. The general slope of the plains through which the canal runs is south-west, but those of the Rio Negro slope south-east.<ref name=EB1911Amaz/>\n\nThe Casiquiare is not a sluggish canal on a flat tableland, but a great, rapid river which, if its upper waters had not found contact with the Orinoco, perhaps by cutting back, would belong entirely to the Negro branch of the Amazon.<ref name=EB1911Amaz/>\n\nTo the west of the Casiquiare, there is a much shorter and easier [[portage]] between the Orinoco and Amazon basins, called the isthmus of [[Pimichin]], which is reached by ascending the Terni branch of the [[Atabapo River]], an affluent of the Orinoco. Although the Terni is somewhat obstructed, it is believed that it could easily be made navigable for small craft. The isthmus is {{convert|10|mi|km|0}} across, with undulating ground, nowhere over {{convert|50|ft|m|order=flip|0}} high, with swamps and marshes. It is much used for the transit of large canoes, which are hauled across it from the Terni river, and which reach the Rio Negro by the little stream called the Pimichin.<ref name=EB1911Amaz/>\n\n==Hydrographic divide==\nThe Casiquiare canal \u2013 Orinoco River hydrographic divide is a representation of the [[hydrography|hydrographic]] [[water divide]] that delineates the separation between the Orinoco Basin and the [[Amazon Basin]]. (The Orinoco Basin flows west&ndash;north&ndash;northeast into the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]; the Amazon Basin flows east into the western [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] in the extreme northeast of [[Brazil]].)\n\nEssentially the river divide is a west-flowing, upriver section of Venezuela's Orinoco River with an outflow to the south into the Amazon Basin. This named outflow is the Casiquiare canal, which, as it heads downstream (southerly), picks up speed and also accumulates water volume.\n\nThe greatest manifestation of the divide is during floods. During flood stage, the Casiquiare's main outflow point into the Rio Negro is supplemented by an overflow that is a second, and more minor, entry river bifurcation into the Rio Negro and upstream from its major, common low-water entry confluence with the Rio Negro. At flood, the river becomes an area flow source, far more than a narrow confined river.\n\nThe Casiquiare canal connects the upper Orinoco, {{convert|9|mi|km|order=flip}} below the mission of Esmeraldas, with the Rio Negro affluent of the Amazon River near the town of San Carlos.<ref name=EB1911Amaz/>\n\nThe simplest description (besides the entire area-floodplain) of the water divide is a \"south-bank Orinoco River strip\" at the exit point of the Orinoco, also the origin of the Casiquiare canal. However, during the Orinoco's flood stage, that single, simply defined \"origin of the canal\" is turned into a region, and an entire strip along the southern bank of the Orinoco River.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Crypturellus casiquiare]]'', the barred tinamou.\n*[[List of unusual drainage systems]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Sources===\n*VARESCHI, Volkmar.

It is among the largest and oldest [[dynasty|royal houses]] in Europe and the world, and consists of Hugh Capet's male-line descendants. The senior line ruled in France as the [[House of Capet]] from the election of Hugh Capet in 987 until the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] in 1328. That line was succeeded by [[cadet branch]]es, the Houses of [[House of Valois|Valois]] and then [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]], which ruled until the [[French Revolution]].\n\nThe dynasty had a crucial role in the formation of the French state. Initially obeyed only in their own demesne, the [[\u00cele-de-France]], the Capetian kings slowly but steadily increased their power and influence until it grew to cover the entirety of their realm. For a detailed narration on the growth of French royal power, see ''[[Crown lands of France]]''.\n\nMembers of the dynasty were traditionally Catholic, and the early Capetians had an alliance with the Church. The French were also the most active participants in the Crusades, culminating in a series of five Crusader Kings \u2013 [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]], [[Philip II of France|Philip Augustus]], [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]], [[Louis IX of France|Saint Louis]], and [[Philip III of France|Philip III]]. The Capetian alliance with the papacy suffered a severe blow after the disaster of the [[Aragonese Crusade]]. Philip III's son and successor, [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]], humiliated a pope and brought the [[Avignon Papacy|papacy under French control]]. The later Valois, starting with [[Francis I of France|Francis I]], ignored religious differences and allied with the [[Ottoman Sultanate|Ottoman Sultan]] to counter the growing power of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] was a Protestant at the time of his accession, but realized the necessity of conversion after four years of religious warfare.\n\nThe Capetians generally enjoyed a harmonious family relationship. By tradition, younger sons and brothers of the King of France are given [[appanage]]s for them to maintain their rank and to dissuade them from claiming the French crown itself. When Capetian cadets did aspire for kingship, their ambitions were directed not at the French throne, but at foreign thrones. Through this, the Capetians spread widely over Europe.\n\nIn modern times, both King [[Felipe VI of Spain]] and Grand Duke [[Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Henri]] of [[Luxembourg]] are members of this family, both through the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon branch]] of the dynasty. Along with the [[House of Habsburg]], it was one of the two most powerful [[continental Europe]]an royal families, dominating European politics for nearly five centuries.\n\n== Name origins and usage ==\nThe name of the dynasty derives from its founder, [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh]], who was known as \"Hugh Capet\". The meaning of \"Capet\" (a nickname rather than a surname of the modern sort) is unknown. While folk etymology identifies it with \"cape\", other suggestions suggest it to be connected to the Latin word ''caput'' (\"head\"), and explain it as meaning \"chief\" or \"head\".{{citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nHistorians in the 19th century (see [[House of France]]) came to apply the name \"Capetian\" to both the ruling house of France and to the wider-spread male-line descendants of Hugh Capet. It was not a contemporary practice. The name \"Capet\" has also been used as a surname for French royalty, particularly but not exclusively those of the [[House of Capet]]. One notable use was during the French Revolution, when the dethroned [[King Louis XVI]] (a member of the [[House of Bourbon]] and a direct male-line descendant of Hugh Capet) and [[Marie Antoinette of Austria|Queen Marie Antoinette]] (a member of the [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]]) were referred to as \"Louis and Antoinette Capet\" (the queen being addressed as \"the Widow Capet\" after the execution of her husband).\n\n== The Robertians and before ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}\n{{Capetian Cadets}}\n{{Main|Robertians}}\nThe dynastic surname now used to describe Hugh Capet's family prior to his election as King of France is \"Robertians\" or \"Robertines.\" The name is derived from the family's first certain ancestor, [[Robert the Strong]] (b. 820), the count of Paris. Robert was probably son of [[Robert III of Worms]] (b. 800) and grandson of [[Robert of Hesbaye]] (b. 770). The Robertians probably originated in the county [[Hesbaye]], around [[Tongeren]] in modern-day Belgium.\n\nThe sons of Robert the Strong were [[Odo of France|Odo]] and [[Robert I of France|Robert]], who both ruled as king of [[Western Francia]]. The family became [[Count of Paris|Counts of Paris]] under Odo and Dukes of the [[Franks]] under Robert, possessing large parts of [[Neustria]].\n\nThe Carolingian dynasty ceased to rule France upon the death of [[Louis V of France|Louis V]]. After the death of Louis V, the son of Hugh the Great, [[Hugh Capet]], was elected by the nobility as king of France. Hugh was crowned at [[Noyon]] on 3 July 987 with the full support from [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]. With Hugh's coronation, a new era began for France, and his descendants came to be named the ''Capetians,'' with the Capetian dynasty and its cadet branches such as the [[House of Valois]] ruling France for more than 800 years (987\u20131848, with some interruptions<ref>Specific periods of reign are 888\u2013898, 922\u2013923, 987\u20131792, 1814\u20131815, and 1815\u20131848 \u2013 the more-than-800-year uninterrupted period 987\u20131792 forming the bulk.</ref>).\n\n=== Robertian family branches ===\n*Rodbert\n**[[Ingerman of Hesbaye]]\n***[[Ermengarde of Hesbaye]], wife of [[Louis the Pious]]\n**[[Cancor]], founder of the [[Lorsch Abbey]]\n***Heimrich (\u2212795), count in the [[Lahngau]]\n****[[Poppo of Grapfeld]] (\u2212839/41), ancestor of the Frankish [[House of Babenberg]]\n**Landrada\n***[[Chrodegang of Metz|Saint Chrodogang]], Archbishop of Metz, Abbot of the [[Lorsch Abbey]]\n**[[Robert of Hesbaye]]\n***[[Robert III of Worms]]\n****[[Robert the Strong]]\n*****[[Odo of France|Odo]], king of [[Western Francia]]\n*****Richildis, married to a count of Troyes\n*****[[Robert I of France|Robert]], king of [[Western Francia]]\n******[[Emma of France|Emma]], married [[Rudolph, Duke of Burgundy|Rudolph of Burgundy]]\n******Adela, married [[Herbert II, Count of Vermandois]]\n******[[Hugh the Great]]\n*******[[Hugh Capet]], founder House of Capet\n********[[Hedwig of France|Hadwig]], married [[Reginar IV, Count of Mons]]\n********[[Robert II of France|Robert II]]\n*******Otto-Henry\n*******Odo\n*******Beatrix, married [[Frederick I, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Frederick of Bar]]\n*******Emma, married [[Richard I of Normandy]]\n*******[[Herbert of Selkirk|Herbert]], bishop of [[Auxerre]]\n\n== Capetians through history ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}\nOver the succeeding centuries, Capetians spread throughout Europe, ruling every form of provincial unit from [[monarchy|kingdoms]] to [[Manorialism|manors]].\n\n=== Salic law ===\n[[Salic law]], reestablished during the [[Hundred Years' War]] from an ancient [[Salian Franks|Frankish]] tradition, caused the French monarchy to permit only male ([[Agnatic succession|agnatic]]) descendants of Hugh to succeed to the throne of France.\n\nWithout Salic law, upon the death of [[John I of France|John I]], the crown would have passed to his half-sister, [[Joan II of Navarre|Joan]] (later Joan II of Navarre). However, Joan's paternity was suspect due to her mother's adultery in the [[Tour de Nesle Affair]]; the French magnates adopted Salic law to avoid the succession of a possible bastard.\n\nIn 1328, King [[Charles IV of France]] died without male heirs, as his brothers did before him. [[Philip VI of France|Philip of Valois]], the late king's first cousin acted as regent, pending the birth of the king's posthumous child, which proved to be a girl. [[Isabella of France]], sister of Charles IV, claimed the throne for her son, [[Edward III of England]]. The English king did not find support among the French lords, who made Philip of Valois their king. From then on the French succession not only excluded females, but also rejected claims based on the female line of descent.\n\nThus the French crown passed from the [[House of Capet]] after the death of [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] to [[Philip VI of France]] of the [[House of Valois]], a [[cadet branch]] of the Capetian dynasty,\n*then to Louis II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, of the Orl\u00e9ans branch of the Valois, who became [[Louis XII of France]],\n*then to Francis, Duke of Valois, Count of Angoul\u00e8me, who became [[Francis I of France]], and his descendants, of the Orl\u00e9ans-Angoul\u00e8me,\n*then to Henry III of Navarre, who became [[Henry IV of France]], of the [[House of Bourbon]], a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty.\n\nThis did not affect monarchies not under that law such as Portugal, Spain, [[Navarre]], and various smaller duchies and counties. Therefore, many royal families appear and disappear in the French succession or become cadet branches upon marriage. A complete list of the senior-most line of Capetians is available [[#Senior Capets|below]].\n\n=== Capetian cadet branches ===\nThe Capetian Dynasty has been broken many times into (sometimes rival) cadet branches. A cadet branch is a line of descent from another line than the senior-most.

However, since primogeniture and the [[Salic law]] provided for the succession of the French throne for most of French history, here is a list of all the predecessors of the French monarchy, all the French kings from Hugh until Charles, and all the [[Legitimist]] pretenders thereafter. All dates are for seniority, not reign. It is important to note that historians class the predecessors of Hugh Capet as ''Robertians'', not ''Capetians''.\n\nNoblemen in [[Neustria]] and their descendants (dates uncertain):\n* [[Cheribert of Neustria|Cheribert]] (Until 636)\n* [[Chrodobertus I of Neustria|Chrodobertus]] (From 636)\n* [[Lambert I of Neustria|Lambert I]] (Until 650)\n* [[Chrodobertus, son of Lambert I|Chrodobertus]] (650\u2013653)\n* [[Lambert II of Neustria|Lambert II]] (653\u2013741)\n\nCount in the Upper [[Upper Rhine|Rhine Valley]] and [[Wormgau]]:\n* [[Rutpert I]] (741\u2013757)\n* [[Thuringbert of Wormgau|Thuringbert]] (757\u2013770)\n* [[Robert of Hesbaye|Rutpert II]] (770\u2013807)\n* [[Robert III of Worms|Rutpert III]] (807 -834)\n* [[Robert the Strong|Rutpert IV]] (834\u2013866)\n\n[[King of France]]:\n* [[Odo, Count of Paris|Odo]] (866\u2013898)\n* [[Robert I of France|Robert I]] (898\u2013923)\n\nCount of Paris:\n* [[Hugh the Great|Hugh]] (923\u2013956)\n\n[[King of France]]:\n* [[Hugh Capet|Hugh]] (987\u2013996)\n* [[Robert II of France|Robert II]] (996\u20131031)\n* [[Henry I of France|Henry I]] (1031\u20131060)\n* [[Philip I of France|Philip I]] (1060\u20131108)\n* [[Louis VI of France|Louis VI]] (1108\u20131137)\n* [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]] (1137\u20131180)\n* [[Philip II of France|Philip II]] (1180\u20131223)\n* [[Louis VIII of France|Louis VIII]] (1223\u20131226)\n* [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] (1226\u20131270)\n* [[Philip III of France|Philip III]] (1271\u20131285)\n* [[Philip IV of France|Philip IV]] (1285\u20131314)\n* [[Louis X of France|Louis X]] (1314\u20131316)\n* [[John I of France|John I]] (1316)\n* [[Philip V of France|Philip V]] (1316\u20131322)\n* [[Charles IV of France|Charles IV]] (1322\u20131328)\n* [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]] (1328\u20131350)\n* [[John II of France|John II]] (1350\u20131364)\n* [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] (1364\u20131380)\n* [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]] (1380\u20131422)\n* [[Charles VII of France|Charles VII]] (1422\u20131461)\n* [[Louis XI of France|Louis XI]] (1461\u20131483)\n* [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] (1483\u20131498)\n* [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] (1498\u20131515)\n* [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (1515\u20131547)\n* [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] (1547\u20131559)\n* [[Francis II of France|Francis II]] (1559\u20131560)\n* [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (1560\u20131574)\n* [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1574\u20131589)\n* [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]] (1589\u20131610)\n* [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] (1610\u20131643)\n* [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] (1643\u20131715)\n* [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] (1715\u20131774)\n* [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] (1774\u20131793)\n* [[Louis XVII of France|Louis XVII]] (1793\u20131795)\n* [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] (1795\u20131824)\n* [[Charles X of France|Charles X]] (1824\u20131836)\n\nDuke of [[Angoul\u00eame]]:\n*[[Louis-Antoine, Duke of Angoul\u00eame|Louis XIX]] (1836\u20131844)\n\nCount of [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chambord|Chambord]]:\n*[[Henri, comte de Chambord|Henri]] (1844\u20131883)\n\nCount of [[Montiz\u00f3n]]:\n*[[Juan, Count of Montiz\u00f3n|Juan]] (1883\u20131887)\n\t \nDuke of [[Madrid]]:\n*[[Carlos, Duke of Madrid|Carlos]] (1887\u20131909)\n\t \nDuke of [[Anjou]] and [[Madrid]]:\n*[[Jacques, Duke of Anjou and Madrid|Jacques]] (1909\u20131931)\n\t \nDuke of [[Saint James the Great|San Jaime]]:\n*[[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Alfonso Carlos]] (1931\u20131936)\n\t \n[[King of Spain]]:\n*[[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] (1936\u20131941)\n\t\nDuke of [[Anjou]] and [[Segovia]]:\n*[[Jaime, Duque de Segovia|Jacques Henri]] (1941\u20131975)\n\t\nDuke of [[Anjou]] and [[C\u00e1diz]]:\n*[[Alfonso, Duke of Anjou and C\u00e1diz|Alphonse]] (1975\u20131989)\n\t\nDuke of [[Anjou]]:\n*[[Louis-Alphonse, Duc d'Anjou|Louis]] (1989\u2013present)\n\n== The Capetian dynasty today ==\nMany years have passed since the Capetian monarchs ruled a large part of Europe; however, they still remain as kings, as well as other titles. Currently two Capetian monarchs still rule in Spain and Luxembourg. In addition, seven [[pretender]]s represent exiled dynastic monarchies in Brazil, France, Spain, Portugal, Parma and Two Sicilies. The current legitimate, senior family member is [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou|Louis-Alphonse de Bourbon]], known by his supporters as [[Duke of Anjou]], who also holds the [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') claim to the French throne. Overall, dozens of branches of the Capetian dynasty still exist throughout Europe.\n\nExcept for the [[House of Braganza]] (founded by an [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|illegitimate son]] of King [[John I of Portugal]], who was himself illegitimate), all current major Capetian branches are of the Bourbon cadet branch. Within the House of Bourbon, many of these lines are themselves well-defined cadet lines of the House.\n\n=== Current Capetian rulers ===\n* [[Henri of Luxembourg|Henri]], [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]] (since 2000)\n*[[Felipe VI of Spain|Felipe VI]], [[King of Spain]] (since 2014)\n\n=== Current Capetian pretenders ===\n* [[Louis Alphonse, Duke of Anjou]], [[Legitimist]] (''[[Blancs d'Espagne]]'') pretender to France since 1989.\n* [[Prince Pedro, Duke of Calabria]], Calabrian pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since 2015.\n* [[Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro]], Castroist pretender to the [[Two Sicilies]] since 2008.\n* [[Carlos, Duke of Parma]], pretender to Parma since 2010.\n* [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma]], [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to Spain since 1979.\n* [[Henri, Count of Paris (born 1933)|Henri, Count of Paris]], [[Legitimist]] (''Blancs d'Eu'') and [[Orl\u00e9anist]] pretender to France since 1999.\n* [[Prince Pedro Carlos of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], Petr\u00f3polis pretender to Brazil since 2007.\n* [[Prince Luiz of Orl\u00e9ans-Braganza]], Vassouras pretender to Brazil since 1981.\n* [[Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza]], pretender to Portugal since 1976.\n\n== Current numbers ==\n{{see also|Royal descent}}\nIt is estimated that the agnatic (male line) descendants of the Capetian dynasty consists of 6,500 people (dead and alive){{Citation needed|date = August 2015}}.\n\nThe small number of agnatic descendants of the kings of France, compared with a theoretical number, is explained by the frequent marriages between Capetian cousins between the 12th and 20th centuries.

A cuboctahedron has 12 identical [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], with 2 triangles and 2 squares meeting at each, and 24 identical [[edge (geometry)|edges]], each separating a triangle from a square. As such, it is a [[quasiregular polyhedron]], i.e. an [[Archimedean solid]] that is not only [[vertex-transitive]] but also [[edge-transitive]].\n\nIts [[dual polyhedron]] is the [[rhombic dodecahedron]].\n\nThe cuboctahedron was probably known to [[Plato]]: [[Hero of Alexandria|Heron]]'s ''Definitiones'' quotes [[Archimedes]] as saying that Plato knew of a solid made of 8 triangles and 6 squares.<ref>{{citation|last=Heath|first=Thomas L.|authorlink=Thomas Little Heath|title=A manual of Greek mathematics|publisher= Clarendon|pages=176|year=1931}}</ref>\n\n==Other names==\n*''Heptaparallelohedron'' ([[Buckminster Fuller]])\n**Fuller applied the name \"[[Dymaxion]]\" to this shape, used in an early version of the [[Dymaxion map]]. He also called it the \"Vector Equilibrium\" because of its special symmetry (its center-to-vertex radius equals its edge length).<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sM44p385Ws Vector Equilibrium: R. Buckminster Fuller]</ref> He called a cuboctahedron consisting of rigid struts connected by flexible vertices a \"jitterbug\" (this shape can be deformed into an [[octahedron]], [[tetrahedron]] or [[icosahedron]] by collapsing its square sides). \n*With O<sub>h</sub> symmetry, order 48, it is a ''[[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]]'' or ''rectified octahedron'' ([[Norman Johnson (mathematician)|Norman Johnson]])\n*With T<sub>d</sub> symmetry, order 24, it is a ''[[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]'' or rhombitetratetrahedron.\n*With D<sub>3d</sub> symmetry, order 12, it is a ''triangular [[gyrobicupola]]''.\n\n==Area and volume==\nThe area ''A'' and the volume ''V'' of the cuboctahedron of edge length ''a'' are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nA &= \\left(6+2\\sqrt{3}\\right)a^2 &&\\approx 9.464\\,1016a^2 \\\\\nV &= \\tfrac{5}{3} \\sqrt{2}a^3 &&\\approx 2.357\\,0226a^3. \\end{align}</math>\n\n==Orthogonal projections==\nThe ''cuboctahedron'' has four special [[orthogonal projection]]s, centered on a vertex, an edge, and the two types of faces, triangular and square. The last two correspond to the B<sub>2</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> [[Coxeter plane]]s. The skew projections show a square and hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron.\n{|class=wikitable\n|+ Cuboctahedron (orthogonal projections)\n|-\n!Square<br>Face\n!Triangular<br>Face\n!Vertex\n!Edge\n!colspan=2|Skew\n|- align=center\n|[[File:Polyhedron 6-8 from red max.png|70px]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron 6-8 from yellow max.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron 6-8 from blue max.png|60px]]\n|\n|\n|\n|- align=center\n|[[File:3-cube t1 B2.svg|80px]]\n|[[File:3-cube t1.svg|80px]]\n||[[File:Cube t1 v.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Cube t1 e.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Cuboctahedron B2 planes.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Cuboctahedron 3 planes.png|80px]]\n|- align=center\n|[4]\n|[6]\n|[2]\n|[2]\n|\n|\n|-\n!colspan=6|[[Rhombic dodecahedron]] (Dual polyhedron)\n|-\n|[[File:Dual cube t1 B2.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Dual cube t1.png|80px]]\n||[[File:Dual cube t1 v.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Dual cube t1 e.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Dual cube t1 skew1.png|80px]]\n|[[File:Dual cube t1 skew2.png|80px]]\n|}\n\n==Spherical tiling==\nThe cuboctahedron can also be represented as a [[spherical tiling]], and projected onto the plane via a [[stereographic projection]].

With the addition of 6 vertices of the [[octahedron]], these vertices represent the 18 root vectors of the [[simple Lie group]] B<sub>3</sub>.\n\n== Dissection==\n\nThe ''cuboctahedron'' can be dissected into two [[triangular cupola]]s by a common hexagon passing through the center of the cuboctahedron. If these two triangular cupolas are twisted so triangles and squares line up, [[Johnson solid]] J<sub>27</sub>, the [[triangular orthobicupola]], is created.\n: [[File:Cuboctahedron 3 planes.png|120px]][[File:Triangular cupola.png|120px]][[File:Triangular_orthobicupola.png|120px]]\n\nThe cuboctahedron can also be dissected into 6 [[square pyramid]]s and 8 [[tetrahedra]] meeting at a central point. This dissection is expressed in the [[alternated cubic honeycomb]] where pairs of square pyramids are combined into [[octahedra]].\n: [[File:TetraOctaHoneycomb-VertexConfig.svg|160px]]\n\n==Geometric relations==\n[[File:P1-A3-P1.gif|thumb|Progression between a [[tetrahedron]], expanded into a cuboctahedron, and reverse expanded into the dual tetrahedron]]\n[[File:A3-P5-P3.gif|thumb|Progressions between an [[octahedron]], [[pseudoicosahedron]], and cuboctahedron]]\nThe cuboctahedron is the unique convex polyhedron in which the long radius (center to vertex) is the same as the edge length; thus its long diameter (vertex to opposite vertex) is 2 edge lengths. This special symmetry is a property of only a few [[polytopes]]: the two-dimensional [[hexagon]], the three-dimensional cuboctahedron, and the four-dimensional [[24-cell]] and [[tesseract|8-cell (tesseract)]]. Only these polytopes can be constructed, with their radii, from equilateral triangles which meet at the center of the polytope, each contributing two radii and an edge. More generally, all the interior elements which meet at the center of these polytopes have special symmetry, as in the dissection of the cuboctahedron into 6 square pyramids and 8 tetrahedra. Each polytope also occurs as cells of a characteristic space-filling [[tessellation]]: the tiling of regular hexagons, the [[rectified cubic honeycomb]] (of alternating cuboctahedra and octahedra), the [[24-cell honeycomb]] and the [[tesseractic honeycomb]]. Each tessellation has a [[dual tessellation]]; the cell centers in a tessellation are cell vertices in its dual tessellation. The densest regular [[sphere-packing]] in two, three and four dimensions uses the cell centers of one of these tessellations as sphere centers.\n\nA cuboctahedron can be obtained by taking an equatorial [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of a four-dimensional [[24-cell]] or [[16-cell]]. A hexagon can be obtained by taking an equatorial cross section of a cuboctahedron.\n\nA cuboctahedron has octahedral symmetry. Its first [[stellation]] is the [[polyhedral compound|compound]] of a [[cube (geometry)|cube]] and its dual [[octahedron]], with the vertices of the cuboctahedron located at the midpoints of the edges of either.\n\nThe cuboctahedron is a [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] [[cube]] and also a rectified [[octahedron]].\n\nIt is also a [[Cantellation (geometry)|cantellated]] [[tetrahedron]]. With this construction it is given the [[Wythoff symbol]]: {{nowrap|3 3 {{!}} 2}}. [[Image:Cantellated tetrahedron.png|50px]]\n\nA skew cantellation of the tetrahedron produces a solid with faces parallel to those of the cuboctahedron, namely eight triangles of two sizes, and six rectangles. While its edges are unequal, this solid remains ''vertex-uniform'': the solid has the full tetrahedral [[symmetry group]] and its vertices are equivalent under that group.\n\nThe edges of a cuboctahedron form four regular [[hexagon]]s. If the cuboctahedron is cut in the plane of one of these hexagons, each half is a [[triangular cupola]], one of the [[Johnson solid]]s; the cuboctahedron itself thus can also be called a triangular [[bicupola (geometry)|gyrobicupola]], the simplest of a series (other than the [[gyrobifastigium]] or \"digonal gyrobicupola\"). If the halves are put back together with a twist, so that triangles meet triangles and squares meet squares, the result is another Johnson solid, the [[triangular orthobicupola]], also called an anticuboctahedron.\n\nBoth triangular bicupolae are important in [[sphere packing]]. The distance from the solid's center to its vertices is equal to its edge length. Each central [[sphere]] can have up to twelve neighbors, and in a face-centered cubic lattice these take the positions of a cuboctahedron's vertices. In a [[hexagon]]al close-packed lattice they correspond to the corners of the triangular orthobicupola. In both cases the central sphere takes the position of the solid's center.\n\nCuboctahedra appear as cells in three of the [[convex uniform honeycomb]]s and in nine of the convex [[uniform 4-polytope]]s.\n\nThe volume of the cuboctahedron is {{sfrac|5|6}} of that of the enclosing cube and {{sfrac|5|8}} of that of the enclosing octahedron.\n\n=== Vertex arrangement ===\nThe cuboctahedron shares its edges and vertex arrangement with two [[nonconvex uniform polyhedron|nonconvex uniform polyhedra]]: the [[cubohemioctahedron]] (having the square faces in common) and the [[octahemioctahedron]] (having the triangular faces in common). It also serves as a cantellated [[tetrahedron]], as being a rectified [[tetratetrahedron]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"400\" style=\"vertical-align:top;text-align:center\"\n|[[Image:cuboctahedron.png|100px]]<br>Cuboctahedron\n|[[Image:cubohemioctahedron.png|100px]]<br>[[Cubohemioctahedron]]\n|[[Image:octahemioctahedron.png|100px]]<br>[[Octahemioctahedron]]\n|}\n\nThe cuboctahedron [[covering space|2-covers]] the [[tetrahemihexahedron]],<ref name=\"richter\">{{citation |ref={{harvid|Richter}} |first=David A. |last=Richter |url=http://homepages.wmich.edu/~drichter/rptwo.htm |title=Two Models of the Real Projective Plane}}\n</ref> which accordingly has the same [[abstract polytope|abstract]] [[vertex figure]] (two triangles and two squares: 3.4.3.4) and half the vertices, edges, and faces.

It is also unique among the Platonic solids in having faces with an even number of sides and, consequently, it is the only member of that group that is a [[zonohedron]] (every face has point symmetry).\n\nThe cube can be cut into six identical [[square pyramid]]s. If these square pyramids are then attached to the faces of a second cube, a [[rhombic dodecahedron]] is obtained (with pairs of coplanar triangles combined into rhombic faces).\n\n==Other dimensions==\nThe analogue of a cube in four-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] has a special name\u2014a [[tesseract]] or [[hypercube]]. More properly, a hypercube (or ''n''-dimensional cube or simply ''n''-cube) is the analogue of the cube in ''n''-dimensional Euclidean space and a tesseract is the order-4 hypercube. A hypercube is also called a ''measure polytope''.\n\nThere are analogues of the cube in lower dimensions too: a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in dimension 0, a [[segment (mathematics)|segment]] in one dimension and a square in two dimensions.\n\n==Related polyhedra==\n[[Image:Dual Cube-Octahedron.svg|thumb|200px|right|The dual of a cube is an [[octahedron]], seen here with vertices at the center of the cube's square faces.]]\n[[File:Hemicube.svg|200px|thumb|The [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]] is the 2-to-1 quotient of the cube.]]\nThe quotient of the cube by the [[Antipodal point|antipodal]] map yields a [[projective polyhedron]], the [[Hemicube (geometry)|hemicube]].\n\nIf the original cube has edge length 1, its [[dual polyhedron]] (an [[octahedron]]) has edge length <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2}/2</math>.\n\nThe cube is a special case in various classes of general polyhedra:\n{|class=wikitable\n!Name!!Equal edge-lengths?!!Equal angles?!!Right angles?\n|-\n|'''Cube'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''||'''Yes'''\n|-\n|[[Rhombohedron]]||Yes||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[Cuboid]]||No||Yes||Yes\n|-\n|[[Parallelepiped]]||No||Yes||No\n|-\n|[[quadrilateral]]ly faced hexahedron||No||No||No\n|}\n\nThe vertices of a cube can be grouped into two groups of four, each forming a regular [[tetrahedron]]; more generally this is referred to as a [[demicube]]. These two together form a regular [[polyhedral compound|compound]], the [[stella octangula]]. The intersection of the two forms a regular octahedron. The symmetries of a regular tetrahedron correspond to those of a cube which map each tetrahedron to itself; the other symmetries of the cube map the two to each other.\n\nOne such regular tetrahedron has a volume of {{sfrac|1|3}} of that of the cube. The remaining space consists of four equal irregular tetrahedra with a volume of {{sfrac|1|6}} of that of the cube, each.\n\nThe [[Rectification (geometry)|rectified]] cube is the [[cuboctahedron]]. If smaller corners are cut off we get a polyhedron with six [[octagon]]al faces and eight triangular ones. In particular we can get regular octagons ([[truncated cube]]). The [[rhombicuboctahedron]] is obtained by cutting off both corners and edges to the correct amount.\n\nA cube can be inscribed in a [[dodecahedron]] so that each vertex of the cube is a vertex of the dodecahedron and each edge is a diagonal of one of the dodecahedron's faces; taking all such cubes gives rise to the regular compound of five cubes.\n\nIf two opposite corners of a cube are truncated at the depth of the three vertices directly connected to them, an irregular octahedron is obtained. Eight of these irregular octahedra can be attached to the triangular faces of a regular octahedron to obtain the cuboctahedron.\n\nThe cube is topologically related to a series of spherical polyhedra and tilings with order-3 [[vertex figure]]s.\n{{Order-3 tiling table}}\n\nThe cuboctahedron is one of a family of uniform polyhedra related to the cube and regular octahedron.\n{{Octahedral truncations}}\n\nThe cube is topologically related as a part of sequence of regular tilings, extending into the [[List_of_regular_polytopes#Hyperbolic_tilings|hyperbolic plane]]: {4,p}, p=3,4,5...\n{{Regular square tiling table}}\n\nWith [[dihedral symmetry]], Dih<sub>4</sub>, the cube is topologically related in a series of uniform polyhedra and tilings 4.2n.2n, extending into the hyperbolic plane:\n{{Truncated figure3 table}}\n\nAll these figures have [[octahedral symmetry]].\n\nThe cube is a part of a sequence of rhombic polyhedra and tilings with [''n'',3] [[Coxeter group]] symmetry.

Trains operate following a schedule at speeds varying from 50 to 225&nbsp;km/h (30 to 140&nbsp;mph){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}. Distance charges or [[zone pricing]] may be used.\n\nNon-English names include ''Treno suburbano'' in Italian, ''[[Cercan\u00edas]]'' in Spanish, ''[[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]]'' in Catalan, ''[[Proastiakos]]'' in Greek, ''[[S-Bahn]]'' in German (although ''Regionalbahn'' or stopping services occasionally also operate as commuter trains), ''Train de banlieue'' in French, ''P\u0159\u00edm\u011bstsk\u00fd vlak'' or ''Esko'' in Czech, ''[[Elektrichka]]'' in Russian, ''Poci\u0105g podmiejski '' in Polish and ''Pendelt\u00e5g'' in Swedish. The development of commuter rail services has become popular today, with the increased public awareness of congestion, dependence on fossil fuels, and other [[List of environmental issues|environmental issues]], as well as the rising costs of owning, operating and [[parking]] automobiles.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Mumbai Train.JPG|thumb|[[Mumbai Suburban Railway]] carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis]]\n\nMost commuter (or suburban) trains are built to main line rail standards{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}, differing from [[light rail]] or [[rapid transit]] (metro rail)  systems by:\n*being larger\n*providing more seating and less standing room, owing to the longer distances involved\n*having (in most cases) a lower frequency of service\n*having scheduled services (i.e. trains run at specific times rather than at specific intervals)\n*serving lower-density suburban areas, typically connecting [[suburb]]s to the city center\n*sharing track or [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains\n*not fully grade separated (containing at-grade crossings with crossing gates)\n*being able to skip certain stations as an express service due to normally being driver controlled\n\n===Train schedule===\nCompared to [[rapid transit]] (or metro rail), commuter/suburban rail has lower [[headway|frequency]], following a schedule rather than fixed intervals, and fewer stations spaced further apart. They primarily serve lower density suburban areas (non inner-city), and often share [[right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] with intercity or [[freight]] trains. Some services operate only during peak hours and others uses fewer departures during off peak hours and weekends. Average speeds are high, often 50&nbsp;km/h (30&nbsp;mph) or higher. These higher speeds better serve the longer distances involved. Some services include express services which skip some stations in order to run faster and separate longer distance riders from short-distance ones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe general range of commuter trains' distance varies between 15 and 200&nbsp;km (10 and 125 miles){{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}. Sometimes long distances can be explained by that the train runs between two or several cities (e.g. S-Bahn in the [[Ruhr]] area of Germany). Distances between stations may vary, but are usually much longer than those of urban rail systems. In city centers the train either has a terminal station or passes through the city centre with notably fewer station stops than those of urban rail systems. Toilets are often available on-board trains and in stations.\n\n===Track===\nTheir ability to coexist with freight or intercity services in the same [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] can drastically reduce system construction costs. However, frequently they are built with dedicated tracks within that right-of-way to prevent delays, especially where service densities have converged in the inner parts of the network.\n\nMost such trains run on the [[List of track gauges|local standard gauge]] track. Some systems may run on a narrower or broader gauge. Examples of [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] systems are found in Japan, [[Kereta Commuter Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[KTM Komuter|Malaysia]], [[Greater Bangkok Commuter rail|Thailand]], Switzerland, in the [[Brisbane]] ([[Queensland Rail]]'s [[Queensland Rail City network|City network]]) and [[Perth]] ([[Transperth]]) systems in Australia, in some systems in Sweden, and on the [[:it:Ferrovia Genova-Casella|Genoa-Casella line]] in Italy. Some countries and regions, including [[Helsinki commuter rail|Finland]], India, Pakistan, [[Elektrichka|Russia]], Brazil and Sri Lanka, as well as [[San Francisco]] ([[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]]) in the USA and [[Metro Trains Melbourne|Melbourne]] and [[Adelaide Metro|Adelaide]] in Australia, use [[broad gauge]] track.\n\n===Distinction between other modes of rail===\n\n====Metro====\nMetro rail or [[rapid transit]] usually covers a smaller inner-urban area ranging outwards to between 12&nbsp;km to 20&nbsp;km (or 8 to 14 miles), has a higher train frequency and runs on separate tracks (underground or elevated), whereas commuter rail often shares tracks, technology and the legal framework within mainline railway systems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nHowever, the classification as a metro or rapid rail can be difficult as both may typically cover a metropolitan area exclusively, run on separate tracks in the centre, and often feature purpose-built rolling stock. The fact that the terminology is not standardised across countries (even across English-speaking countries) further complicates matters. This distinction is most easily made when there are two (or more) systems such as New York's [[New York City Subway|subway]] and the [[Long Island Rail Road|LIRR]] and [[Metro-North Railroad]], Paris' [[Paris M\u00e9tro|M\u00e9tro]] and [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] along with [[Transilien]], London's tube lines of the [[London Underground|Underground]] and the [[London Overground|Overground]], (future) [[Crossrail]], [[Thameslink (route)|Thameslink]] along with other commuter rail [[Transport_in_London#Heavy_rail|operators]], Madrid's [[Madrid Metro|Metro]] and [[Cercan\u00edas Madrid|Cercan\u00edas]], Barcelona's [[Barcelona Metro|Metro]] and [[Rodalies de Catalunya|Rodalies]], and Tokyo's [[Tokyo subway|subway]] and the [[East Japan Railway Company#Greater Tokyo Area|JR lines]] along with various privately owned and operated commuter rail systems.\n\n====S-Bahn====\n\nIn Germany the [[S-Bahn]] is regarded as a train category of its own, and exists in many large cities and in some other areas, but there are differing service and technical standards from city to city. \nMost S-Bahns typically behave like commuter rail with most trackage not separated from other trains, and long lines with trains running between cities and suburbs rather than within a city. The distances between stations however, are usually short. In larger systems there is usually a high frequency metro-like central corridor in the city center where all the lines converge into. Typical examples of large city S-Bahns include Munich and Frankfurt. S-Bahns do also exist in some mid-size cities like Rostock and Magdeburg but behave more like typical commuter rail with lower frequencies and very little exclusive trackage. In [[Berlin]], the [[Berlin S-Bahn|S-Bahn systems]] arguably fulfill all considerations of a true metro system (despite the existence of [[U-Bahn]]s as well) \u2013 the trains run on tracks that are entirely separated from other trains, short distances between stations, high frequency and uses tunnels but do run a bit further out from the city centre, compared with U-Bahn. A similar network exists in [[Copenhagen]] called the [[Copenhagen S-train|S-tog]]. (where a [[Copenhagen Metro|metro system]] also exists). In Hamburg and Copenhagen, other, diesel driven trains, do continue where the S-Bahn ends (\"[[AKN Eisenbahn|A-Bahn]]\" in Hamburg area, and \"L-tog\" in Copenhagen).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n====Regional rail====\n[[Regional rail]] usually provides [[rail transport|rail services]] between towns and cities, rather than purely linking major population hubs in the way [[inter-city rail]] does. Regional rail operates outside major cities. Unlike Inter-city, it stops at most or all stations between cities. It provides a service between smaller communities along the line, and also connections with long-distance services at interchange stations located at junctions or at larger towns along the line. Alternative names are \"local train\" or \"stopping train\". Examples include the former [[British Rail|BR]]'s [[Regional Railways]], France's [[Transport express r\u00e9gional|TER]] (''Transport express r\u00e9gional''), Germany's [[DB Regio]] and South Korea's [[Tonggeun]] services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nRegional rail does not exist in this sense in the United States, so the term \"regional rail\" has become synonymous with commuter rail there, although the two are more clearly defined in Europe.\n\n====Inter-city rail====\n[[File:Cityrail-oscar-h3-sydcen.jpg|thumb|A [[NSW TrainLink]] [[NSW TrainLink H set|H set]] at Sydney's [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]].]]\n{{see also|Inter-city rail}}\nIn some European countries the distinction between commuter trains and long-distance/intercity trains is very hard to make, because of the relatively short distances involved. For example, so-called \"[[Inter-city rail|intercity]]\" trains in Belgium and the Netherlands carry many commuters and their equipment, range and speeds are similar to those of commuter trains in some larger countries. In the United Kingdom there is no real division of organisation and brand name between commuter, regional and inter-city trains, making it hard to categorize train connections.\n\n[[Elektrichka|Russian commuter trains]], on the other hand, frequently cover areas larger than Belgium itself, although these are still short distances by Russian standards. They have a different ticketing system from long-distance trains, and in major cities they often operate from a separate section of the train station.\n\nThe easiest way to identify these \"inter-city\" services is that they tend to operate as express services - only linking the main stations in the cities they link, not stopping at any other stations. However, this term is used in Australia (Sydney for example) to describe the regional trains operating beyond the boundaries of the suburban services, even though some of these \"inter-city\" services stop all stations similar to German regional services. In this regard, the German service delineations and corresponding naming conventions are clearer and better used for academic purposes.\n\n====High-speed rail====\nSometimes [[high-speed rail]] can serve daily use of commuters. The Japanese [[Shinkansen]] high speed rail system is heavily used by commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]]. They commute between 100 and 200&nbsp;km by [[Shinkansen]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} To meet the demand of commuters, [[Japan Railways Group|JR]] sells commuter discount passes and operates 16-car [[bilevel car|bilevel]] [[E4 Series Shinkansen]] trains at rush hour, providing a capacity of 1,600 seats. Several lines in China, such as the [[Beijing\u2013Tianjin Intercity Railway]] and the [[Shanghai\u2013Nanjing High-Speed Railway]], serve a similar role with many more under construction or planned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shine.cn/news/metro/1806116099/|title=Metro closes the gap with areas across the border - SHINE|website=SHINE|language=en|access-date=2018-06-23}}</ref>\n\nThe high-speed services linking [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Bern]] and [[Basel]] in [[Switzerland]] ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) have brought the Central Business Districts (CBDs) of these three cities within 1 hour of each other. This has resulted in unexpectedly high demand for new commuter trips between the three cities and a corresponding increase in suburban rail passengers accessing the high-speed services at the main city-centre stations (or Hauptbahnhof). The [[Regional-Express]] commuter service between [[Munich]] and [[Nuremberg]] in Germany go in ({{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}}) along a [[Nuremberg\u2013Munich high-speed railway|300 km/h high-speed line]].\n\nThe regional trains [[Stockholm]]\u2013[[Uppsala]], Stockholm\u2013[[V\u00e4ster\u00e5s]], Stockholm\u2013[[Eskilstuna]] and [[Gothenburg]]\u2013[[Trollh\u00e4ttan]] in [[Sweden]] reach {{convert|200|km/h|abbr=on}} and have many daily commuters.\n\n==Train types==\nCommuter/suburban trains are usually optimized for maximum passenger volume, in most cases without sacrificing too much comfort and [[luggage]] space, though they seldom have all the amenities of long-distance trains. Cars may be single- or [[bilevel car|double-level]], and aim to provide seating for all. Compared to intercity trains, they have less space, fewer amenities and limited baggage areas.\n\n===Multiple unit type===\n\n[[File:Korail Line 1 Gyeongin express train at Guro.jpg|thumb|right|An [[electric multiple unit]] on the [[Seoul Subway Line 1]] operated by [[Korail]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea]]\nCommuter rail trains are usually composed of [[multiple unit]]s, which are self-propelled, bidirectional, articulated passenger rail cars with driving motors on each (or every other) [[bogie]]. Depending on local circumstances and tradition they may be powered either by [[diesel engines]] located below the passenger compartment ([[diesel multiple unit]]s) or by electricity picked up from [[third rail]]s or [[overhead lines]] ([[electric multiple unit]]s). Multiple units are almost invariably equipped with control cabs at both ends, which is why such units are so frequently used to provide commuter services, due to the associated short turn-around time.\n\n===Locomotive hauled services===\nLocomotive hauled services are used in some countries or locations. This is often a case of [[Business operations|asset sweating]], by using a single large combined fleet for intercity and regional services. Loco hauled services are usually run in [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] formation, that is, the train can run with the locomotive at the \"front\" or \"rear\" of the train (pushing or pulling). Trains are often equipped with a control cab at the other end of the train from the locomotive, allowing the train operator to operate the train from either end. The motive power for locomotive-hauled commuter trains may be either electric or [[Diesel-electric transmission|Diesel-electric]], although some countries, such as Germany and some of the former Soviet-bloc countries, also use diesel-hydraulic locomotives.\n\n=== Seat plans ===\nIn the USA and some other countries, a three-and-two seat plan is used. However, few people sit in the middle seat on these trains because they feel crowded and uncomfortable.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/31/nyregion/for-train-riders-middle-seat-isnt-the-center-of-attention.html|title=For Train Riders, Middle Seat Isn't the Center of Attention|first=Patrick|last=McGeehan|date=31 May 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/06/opinion/on-the-802-express-threes-a-crowd-139947.html|title=On the 8:02 Express, Three's a Crowd|date=6 June 2005|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nIn Japan, longitudinal (sideways window-lining) seating is widely used in many commuter rail trains to increase capacity in rush hours. Carriages are usually not organized to increase [[seating capacity]] (although in some trains at least one carriage would feature more doors to facilitate easier boarding and alighting and bench seats so that they can be folded up during rush hour to provide more standing room) even in the case of commuting longer than 50&nbsp;km and commuters in the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] have to stand in the train for more than an hour.\n\n==Commuter rail systems around the world==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\n\n===Africa===\n{{See also|Template:Suburban railways in Africa}}\n[[File:Kalk Bay Station 3.jpg|thumb|A [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] train pulling out of [[Kalk Bay]] station in [[Cape Town]]]]\nCurrently there are not many examples of commuter rail in Africa. [[Metrorail (South Africa)|Metrorail]] operates in the major cities of South Africa, and there are some commuter rail services in Algeria, Botswana, Kenya, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia.\nIn Algeria, [[SNTF]] operates commuter rail lines between the capital [[Algiers]] and its southern and eastern suburbs. They also serve to connect [[Algiers]]' main [[University of Science and Technology, Houari Boumediene|universities]] to each other. The [[Dar es Salaam commuter rail]] offers intracity services in [[Dar es Salaam]], Tanzania. In Botswana, the ([[Botswana Railways]]) \"BR Express\" has a commuter train between [[Lobatse]] and [[Gaborone]].\n\n===Asia===\n\n====East Asia====\n[[File:JRE-E231-500-for-JRyamanote-line.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Yamanote Line]] is representative of Japanese commuter rail.]]\n\nIn Japan, commuter rail systems have extensive network and frequent service and are heavily used. In many cases, Japanese commuter rail is operationally more like a typical metro system (with very high operating frequencies, an emphasis on [[standing passenger]]s, short station spacing) than it is like commuter rail in other countries. Japanese commuter rail also tends to be heavily interlined with subway lines, with commuter rail trains continuing into the subway network, and then out onto different commuter rail systems on the other side of the city.  Many Japanese commuter systems operate several levels of express trains to reduce the travel time to distant locations, often using station bypass tracks instead of dedicated express tracks. It is notable that the larger Japanese commuter rail systems are owned and operated by for-profit [[private railway]] companies, without public subsidy.\n\nCommuter rail systems have been inaugurated in several cities in China such as [[Beijing Suburban Railway|Beijing]], [[Jinshan Railway|Shanghai]], [[Central Plain Metropolitan Intercity Rail|Zhengzhou]], [[Wuhan Metropolitan Area Intercity Railway|Wuhan]], [[Changsha\u2013Zhuzhou\u2013Xiangtan Intercity Railway|Changsha]] and the [[Pearl River Delta Rapid Transit|Pearl River Delta]]. With plans for large systems in northeastern [[Zhejiang]], [[Jingjinji]], and [[Yangtze River Delta]] areas. The level of service varies considerably from line to line ranging [[high speed rail|high]] to near high speeds. More developed and established lines such as the [[Guangzhou\u2013Shenzhen Railway|Guangshen Railway]] have more frequent metro like service. Hong Kong [[MTR]]'s [[East Rail Line]] and [[West Rail Line]] were built to commuter rail standards but are operated as a metro system.\n\nIn Taiwan, [[Western Line, Taiwan|Western Line]] in [[Taipei]]-[[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan]] Metropolitan Area, [[Taichung]] Metropolitan Area, [[Tainan]]-[[Kaohsiung]] Metropolitan Area as well as [[Neiwan Line|Neiwan]]-[[Liujia Line]] in [[Hsinchu]] Area is considered commuter rail.\n\nOther examples in Asia include [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] of which some lines are suburban lines operated by [[Korail]] in South Korea.\n\n====Southeast Asia====\n[[File:Commuterline at Palmerah Station 4.JPG|thumb|right|Electric multiple unit of [[KA Commuter Jabodetabek]] [[KA Commuter Line Tanah Abang-Maja|Green Line]] train at Palmerah Station, [[Jakarta]]]]\n\nIn [[Indonesia]], the [[Kereta Commuter Indonesia|KA Commuter]] is the largest commuter rail system in the country, serving [[Jabodetabek|Jakarta metropolitan area]]. It connects [[Jakarta]] city center with surrounding cities and sub-urbans in [[Banten]] and [[West Java]] provinces, including [[Depok]], [[Bogor]], [[Tangerang]], [[Bekasi]], Serpong and Maja. In July 2015, KA Commuter Jabodetabek served more than 850,000 passengers per day, which is almost triple of the 2011 figures, but still less than 3.5% of all Jabodetabek commutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2015/07/06/14142481/PT.KCJ.Keterlambatan.KRL.Sudah.di.Bawah.10.Menit |title=PT KCJ: Keterlambatan KRL Sudah di Bawah 10 Menit |date=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOther examples include [[KTM Komuter]] in Malaysia, and the [[Philippine National Railways]] orange line in [[Metro Manila]], Philippines.\n\n====South and West Asia====\nIn India, commuter rail systems are present in major cities. [[Mumbai Suburban Railway]], the oldest suburban rail system in Asia, carries more than 7.24 million commuters on a daily basis which constitutes more than half of the total daily passenger capacity of the Indian Railways itself. [[Kolkata Suburban Railway]] is the biggest Suburban Railway network in India covering 348 stations. The [[Chennai Suburban Railway]] along with [[Chennai MRTS|MRTS]] is another railway of comparison where more than 1 million people travel daily to different areas in [[Chennai]]. Other commuter railways in India include [[Hyderabad MMTS]], [[Delhi Suburban Railway]], [[Pune Suburban Railway]] and [[Lucknow-Kanpur Suburban Railway]].\n\nIn Iran, SYSTRA has done a \"Tehran long term urban rail study\". SYSTRA proposed 4 express lines similar to [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] suburban lines in [[Paris]]. [[Tehran Metro]] is going to construct express lines. For instance, the Rahyab Behineh, a consultant for Tehran Metro, is studying Tehran Express Line 2. Tehran Metro currently has a commuter line between [[Tehran]] and [[Karaj]]. [[Esfahan]] has two lines to its suburbs [[Baharestan]] and [[Fuladshahr]] under construction, and a third line to [[Shahinshahr]] is planned.\n\n===Europe===\n{{Main|R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|Commuter rail in the United Kingdom}}\n[[File:Ny pendeltag stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|Type [[SL X60|X60]] at Stockholm Central in Sweden]]\nMajor metropolitan areas in most European countries are usually served by extensive commuter/suburban rail systems. Well-known examples include [[BG Voz]] in [[Belgrade]] (Serbia), [[S-Bahn]] in Germany and German-speaking areas of Switzerland and Austria, [[Proastiakos]] in Greece, [[R\u00e9seau Express R\u00e9gional|RER]] in France and Belgium, [[Milan suburban railway service|suburban lines]] in [[Milan]] (Italy), [[Cercan\u00edas]] in Spain, [[CP Urban Services]] in Portugal, [[Esko Prague|Esko]] in [[Prague]] and [[Ostrava]] (Czech Republic), [[H\u00c9V]] in [[Budapest]] (Hungary) and [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|DART]] in [[Dublin]] (Ireland).\n\nIn Russia, Ukraine and some other countries of the former [[Soviet Union]], electrical multiple unit passenger suburban trains called [[Elektrichka]] are widespread.\n\nIn Sweden, electrified commuter rail systems known as ''Pendelt\u00e5g'' are present in the cities of [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. The [[Stockholm commuter rail]] system, which began in 1968, is similar to the S-Bahn train systems of Munich and Frankfurt such that it may share railway tracks with inter-city trains and freight trains, but for the most part run on its own dedicated tracks, and that it is mainly used to transport passengers from nearby towns and other suburban areas into the city centre, not for transportation inside the city centre. The [[Gothenburg commuter rail]] system, which began in 1960, is similar to the Stockholm system, but does fully share tracks with long-distance trains. Other train systems that are also considered as commuter rail but not counted as ''pendelt\u00e5g'' include [[Roslagsbanan]] and [[Saltsj\u00f6banan]] in Stockholm, [[\u00d6stg\u00f6tapendeln]] in [[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland County]], [[Uppt\u00e5get]] in [[Uppsala County]] and [[Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail]].  Sk\u00e5ne Commuter Rail (''P\u00e5gat\u00e5gen'') in [[Sk\u00e5ne County]] acts also as a regional rail system, as it serves cities over 100&nbsp;km (62 miles) and over one hour from the principal city of [[Malm\u00f6]].\n\nIn Norway, the [[Oslo Commuter Rail|Oslo commuter rail]] system is the largest, which mostly shares tracks with more long-distance trains, but also runs on some local railways without other traffic. Oslo has the largest commuter rail system in Scandinavia measured as line lengths or number of stations. But some lines have travel times (over an hour from Oslo) and frequencies (once per hour) which are more like regional trains. Also [[Bergen Commuter Rail|Bergen]], [[J\u00e6ren Commuter Rail|Stavanger]] and [[Tr\u00f8nderbanen|Trondheim]] have commuter rail systems. These have only one or two lines each and they share tracks with other trains.\n\nIn Poland, commuter rail systems exist in [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Tricity)|Tricity]], [[Warsaw]], [[Krakow]] and [[Katowice]]. There is also a similar system planned in [[Wroc\u0142aw]].\n\n===Americas===\n====North and Central America====\n{{Main|Commuter rail in North America}}\n[[File:Metrolink F59PHI 885.jpg|thumb|Metrolink provides commuter rail service to six counties in Southern California.]]\nIn the United States, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Mexico regional passenger rail services are provided by governmental or quasi-governmental agencies, with a limited number of metropolitan areas served.\n\nThe six most patronised commuter rail systems in the United States are:\n* [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]]'s [[Long Island Rail Road]], serving [[New York City]] and [[Long Island]]\n* [[NJ Transit Rail Operations|NJ Transit Rail]], serving New York, [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Philadelphia]]\n* MTA's [[Metro-North Railroad]], serving New York, [[Yonkers, New York|Yonkers]] and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]]\n* [[Metra]], serving [[Chicago]]\n* [[SEPTA Regional Rail]], serving Philadelphia\n* [[Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority|MBTA]], serving Boston(Metro-North/South), [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]]\n[[Mexico City]]'s [[Suburban Railway of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area]], [[Toronto]]'s [[GO Transit rail services]], the [[Havana Suburban Railway]], the [[Panama Canal Railway]] and [[Costa Rica]]'s [[Tren Urbano de Costa Rica]] are examples of North American commuter rail systems outside of the United States.\n\n====South America====\n[[File:EMU CSR M20 en Barrancas.jpg|thumb|The [[Mitre Line]] is part of the extensive [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan rail system]].]]\nExamples include an {{convert|899|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} commuter system in the [[Rail transport in Argentina#Commuter networks|Buenos Aires metropolitan area]], the {{convert|225|km|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} long [[Supervia]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the [[Metrotr\u00e9n]] in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], and the [[Valpara\u00edso Metro]] in [[Valpara\u00edso]], Chile. Another example is [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos]] (CPTM) in [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Brazil]]. CPTM has 93 stations with six lines, numbered starting on 7 (the lines 1 to 6 and the line 15 belong to the [[S\u00e3o Paulo Metro]]), with a total length of {{convert|260.8|km}}.\n\n===Oceania===\n{{Main|Commuter rail in Australia}}\n[[File:Siemens train in Metro Trains Melbourne Livery.jpg|thumb|A Melbourne Siemens commuter train]]\nThe five major cities in Australia have suburban railway systems in their metropolitan areas. These networks have frequent services, with frequencies varying from every 10 to every 30 minutes on most suburban lines, and up to 3\u20135 minutes in peak on bundled underground lines in the city centres of Sydney, Brisbane, Perth and Melbourne. The networks in each state developed from mainline railways and have never been completely operationally separate from long distance and freight traffic, unlike [[Rapid transit|metro]] systems in some comparable countries, but nevertheless have cohesive identities and are the backbones of their respective cities' public transport system. The suburban networks are all completely electrified, apart from Adelaide's, which still operates diesel services on most of its lines.\n\nThe main operators of suburban rail in Australia are:\n*[[Sydney Trains]] in Sydney (with connected suburban services in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] and [[Wollongong]] run by its counterpart intercity operator, [[NSW TrainLink]])\n*[[Metro Trains Melbourne]] in Melbourne.

The city of [[Cambridge]] is the [[county town]]. Modern Cambridgeshire was formed in 1974 as an amalgamation of the counties of [[Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely]] and [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]], the former covering the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of Cambridgeshire (including the [[Isle of Ely]]) and the latter covering the historic county of [[Huntingdonshire]] and the [[Soke of Peterborough]], historically part of [[Northamptonshire]]. It contains most of the region known as [[Silicon Fen]].\n\nLocal government is divided between [[Cambridgeshire County Council]] and [[Peterborough City Council]], which, since 1998, forms a separate [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]]. Under the county council, there are five district councils, [[Cambridge City Council]], [[South Cambridgeshire District Council]], [[East Cambridgeshire District Council]], [[Huntingdonshire District Council]] and [[Fenland District Council]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/info/20050/council_structure/81/local_government_in_cambridgeshire|title=Local government in Cambridgeshire|publisher=Cambridgeshire County Council|accessdate=25 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Cambridgeshire}}\nCambridgeshire is noted as the site of [[Flag Fen]] in [[Fengate]], one of the earliest-known [[Neolithic]] permanent settlements in the [[United Kingdom]], compared in importance to [[Balbridie]] in Aberdeen, Scotland. A great quantity of [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds from the [[Stone Age]], the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]] were made in [[East Cambridgeshire]]. Most items were found in [[Isleham]].\n\nCambridgeshire was recorded in the [[Domesday Book]] as \"Grantbridgeshire\" (or rather ''Grentebrigescire'') (related to the river Granta).\n\nCovering a large part of [[East Anglia]], Cambridgeshire today is the result of several local government unifications.  In 1888 when [[county council]]s were introduced, separate councils were set up, following the traditional division of Cambridgeshire, for\n*the area in the south around Cambridge, and\n*the liberty of the [[Isle of Ely]].\nIn 1965, these two administrative counties were merged to form [[Cambridgeshire and the Isle of Ely]].<ref>The Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely Order 1964 (SI 1964/366), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1958 - 1967)]], ''Report and Proposals for the East Midlands General Review Area'' (Report No.3), 31 July 1961 and ''Report and Proposals for the Lincolnshire and East Anglia General Review Area'' (Report No.9), 7 May 1965</ref>\nUnder the [[Local Government Act 1972]] this merged with the county to the west, [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]], which had been formed in 1965, by the merger of [[Huntingdonshire]] with the [[Soke of Peterborough]] (the latter previously a part of [[Northamptonshire]] with its own county council). The resulting county was called simply Cambridgeshire.<ref>[[wikisource:The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972]] (SI 1972/2039) Part 5: County of Cambridgeshire</ref>\n\nSince 1998, the [[City of Peterborough]] has been a separately administered area, as a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]]. It is associated with Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes such as [[Lord-Lieutenant|Lieutenancy]], and joint functions such as policing and the fire service.<ref>[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1996/1878/made The Cambridgeshire (City of Peterborough) (Structural, Boundary and Electoral Changes) Order 1996] (SI 1996/1878), see [[Local Government Commission for England (1992)]], ''Final Recommendations for the Future Local Government of Cambridgeshire'', October 1994 and ''Final Recommendations on the Future Local Government of Basildon & Thurrock, Blackburn & Blackpool, Broxtowe, Gedling & Rushcliffe, Dartford & Gravesham, Gillingham & Rochester upon Medway, Exeter, Gloucester, Halton & Warrington, Huntingdonshire & Peterborough, Northampton, Norwich, Spelthorne and the Wrekin'', December 1995</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the conservation charity [[Plantlife]] unofficially designated Cambridgeshire's [[county flower]] as the [[Pulsatilla vulgaris|Pasqueflower]].\n\nThe [[Cambridgeshire Regiment]] (or [[Cambridgeshire Regiment|Fen Tigers]]), the county-based army unit, fought in the [[Boer War]] of South Africa, the First World War and Second World War.\n\nDue to the county's flat terrain and proximity to the continent, during the Second World War the military built many airfields here for [[RAF Bomber Command]], [[RAF Fighter Command]], and the allied [[USAAF]].  In recognition of this collaboration, the [[Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial]] is located in [[Madingley]]. It is the only WWII burial ground in England for American servicemen who died during that event.\n\nMost English counties have nicknames for their people, such as a \"[[Tyke (dialect)|Tyke]]\" from [[Yorkshire]] and a \"[[Yellowbelly (Lincolnshire)|Yellowbelly]]\" from [[Lincolnshire]]. The traditional [[nickname]]s for people from Cambridgeshire are \"Cambridgeshire Camel\" or \"Cambridgeshire Crane\", referring to the wildfowl that were once abundant in the [[fens]]. The term \"Fenners\" was often applied to those who come from the flat country to the north of Cambridge. Since the late 20th century, this term is considered to be derogatory and has been discouraged in use.\n\nOriginal historical documents relating to Cambridgeshire are held by [[Cambridgeshire Archives and Local Studies]].\n\n==Geography==\n: ''See also [[Geology of Cambridgeshire]]''\nLarge areas of the county are extremely low-lying and [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme Fen]] is notable for being the UK's lowest physical point at 2.75&nbsp;m (9&nbsp;ft) below sea level.

Average winter temperatures are cooler than the English average, due to Cambridgeshire's inland location and relative nearness to continental Europe, which results in the moderating maritime influence being less strong. Snowfall is slightly more common than in western areas, due to the relative winter coolness and easterly winds bringing occasional snow from the North Sea. In summer temperatures are average or slightly above, due to less cloud cover.

(1963) ''The Roman Censors: A Study on Social Structure'' (Helsinki)</ref>\n\nThe power of the censors was absolute: no magistrate could oppose their decisions, only another censor who succeeded them could cancel it.\n\nThe censors' regulation of public morality is the origin of the modern meaning of the words ''censor'' and ''censorship''.<ref>[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=censorship Online Etymology Dictionary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Early history of the magistracy==\nThe ''census'' was first instituted by [[Servius Tullius]], sixth [[king of Rome]], c. 575\u2013535 BC. After the abolition of the [[Kingdom of Rome|monarchy]] and the founding of the  [[Republic]] in 509 BC, the [[Roman consul|consul]]s had responsibility for the census until 443 BC. In 442 BC, no consuls were elected, but [[tribune]]s with consular power were appointed instead. This was a move by the [[plebeians]] to try to attain higher magistracies: only [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] could be elected consuls, while some military tribunes were plebeians. To prevent the possibility of plebeians obtaining control of the census, the patricians removed the right to take the census from the consuls and tribunes, and appointed for this duty two magistrates, called ''censores'' (censors), elected exclusively from the patricians in Rome.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} <!-- Why was taking the census so valuable? -->\n\nIt would not be uncommon for the patrician consulars of the early republic to intersperse public office with agricultural labour.<ref>Jehne, M.

If one of the censors died during his term of office, another was chosen to replace him, just as with consuls. This happened only once, in 393 BC. However, the [[Gauls]] captured Rome in that ''[[lustrum]]'' (five-year period), and the Romans thereafter regarded such replacement as \"an offense against religion\".<ref>Livy v.31.</ref> From then on, if one of the censors died, his colleague resigned, and two new censors were chosen to replace them.<ref>Livy vi.27, ix.34, xxiv.43, xxvii.6.</ref>\n\n==Election==\nThe censors were elected in the [[Centuriate Assembly]], which met under the presidency of a consul.<ref>[[Aulus Gellius]] xiii.15; ''Livy'' xl.45.</ref> [[Barthold Georg Niebuhr|Barthold Niebuhr]] suggests that the censors were at first elected by the [[Curiate Assembly]], and that the Assembly's selections were confirmed by the Centuriate, but [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] believes that \"there is no authority for this supposition, and the truth of it depends entirely upon the correctness of <nowiki>[Niebuhr's]</nowiki> views respecting the election of the consuls\". Both censors had to be elected on the same day, and accordingly if the voting for the second was not finished in the same day, the election of the first was invalidated, and a new assembly had to be held.<ref>Livy ix.34.</ref>\n\nThe assembly for the election of the censors was held under different [[auspice]]s from those at the election of the consuls and [[praetor]]s, so the censors were not regarded as their colleagues, although they likewise possessed the ''[[maxima auspicia]]''.<ref>''Gellii'' xiii.15.</ref> The assembly was held by the new consuls shortly after they began their term of office;<ref>Livy xxiv.10, xxxix.41.</ref> and the censors, as soon as they were elected and the censorial power had been granted to them by a decree of the Centuriate Assembly (''lex centuriata''), were fully installed in their office.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''[[de Lege Agraria]]'' ii.11; ''Livy'' xl.45.</ref>\n\nAs a general principle, the only ones eligible for the office of censor were those who had previously been consuls, but there were a few exceptions. At first, there was no law to prevent a person being censor twice, but the only person who was elected to the office twice was [[Gaius Marcius Rutilus]] in 265 BC.  In that year, he originated a law stating that no one could be elected censor twice.  In consequence of this, he received the [[cognomen]] of ''[[Marcius Censorinus|Censorinus]]''.<ref>[[Plutarch]], ''[[Life of Coriolanus]]'' 1; [[Valerius Maximus]] iv.1 \u00a73.</ref>\n\n==Attributes==\nThe censorship differed from all other Roman magistracies in the length of office. The censors were originally chosen for a whole ''lustrum'' (the period of five years), but as early as ten years after its institution (433 BC) their office was limited to eighteen months by a law of the [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus]].<ref>Livy iv.24, ix.33.</ref> The censors were also unique with respect to rank and dignity. They had no ''[[imperium]]'', and accordingly no [[lictor]]s.<ref>''Zonar''. vii.19.</ref> Their rank was granted to them by the Centuriate Assembly, and not by the ''[[curia]]e'', and in that respect they were inferior in power to the consuls and praetors.<ref>[[Cicero]], ''de Lege Agraria'' ii.11.</ref>\n\nNotwithstanding this, the censorship was regarded as the highest dignity in the state, with the exception of the dictatorship; it was a \"sacred magistracy\" (''sanctus magistratus''), to which the deepest reverence was due.<ref>Plutarch ''[[Life of Cato the Elder]]'' 16, ''[[Life of Flaminius]]'' 18, ''[[Life of Camillus]]'' 2, 14, ''[[Life of Aemilius]]'' 38; Cicero ''[[ad Familiares]]'' iii.10.</ref> The high rank and dignity which the censorship obtained was due to the various important duties gradually entrusted to it, and especially to its possessing the ''regimen morum'', or general control over the conduct and the morals of the citizens.  In the exercise of this power, they were regulated solely by their own views of duty, and were not responsible to any other power in the state.<ref>Dionys. in ''Mai, Nova Coll.'' vol. ii p516; Livy iv.24, xxix.37; Valerius Maximus vii.2 \u00a76.</ref>\n\nThe censors possessed the official stool called a \"[[curule chair]]\" (''sella curulis''),<ref>Livy xl.45.</ref> but some doubt exists with respect to their official dress. A well-known passage of Polybius<ref>vi.53.</ref> describes the use of the ''imagines'' at funerals; we may conclude that a consul or praetor wore the purple-bordered ''[[toga praetexta]]'', one who triumphed the embroidered ''[[toga picta]]'', and the censor a purple toga peculiar to him, but other writers speak of their official dress as being the same as that of the other higher magistrates.<ref>Zonar. vii.19; Athen. xiv. p660c.</ref> The funeral of a censor was always conducted with great pomp and splendour, and hence a \"censorial funeral\" (''funus censorium'') was voted even to the emperors.<ref>[[Tacitus]] ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' iv.15, xiii.2.</ref>\n\n==Abolition==\nThe censorship continued in existence for 421 years, from 443 BC to 22 BC, but during this period, many ''lustra'' passed by without any censor being chosen at all. According to one statement, the office was abolished by [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]].<ref>Schol. Gronov. ''ad Cic. Div. in Caecil.'' 3, p384, ed. [[Johann Caspar Orelli]].</ref>  Although the authority on which this statement rests is not of much weight, the fact itself is probable, since there was no census during the two ''lustra'' which elapsed from Sulla's dictatorship to [[Pompey|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (Pompey)]]'s first consulship (82&ndash;70 BC), and any strict \"imposition of morals\" would have been found inconvenient to the aristocracy that supported Sulla.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nIf the censorship had been done away with by Sulla, it was at any rate restored in the consulship of Pompey and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]]. Its power was limited by one of the laws of the tribune [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]] (58 BC), which prescribed certain regular forms of proceeding before the censors in expelling a person from the [[Roman Senate]], and required that the censors be in agreement to exact this punishment.<ref>[[Cassius Dio]] xxxviii.13; Cicero ''[[pro Sestio]]'' 25, ''de Prov.

(1963) ''The Roman Censors: A Study on Social Structure'' (Helsinki) 58f</ref>\n\nThe original business of the censorship was at first of a much more limited kind, and was restricted almost entirely to taking the census,<ref>Livy iv.8.</ref> but the possession of this power gradually brought with it fresh power and new duties, as is shown below. A general view of these duties is briefly expressed in the following passage of Cicero:<ref>''[[De legibus]]'' iii.3.</ref> \"''Censores populi aevitates, soboles, familias pecuniasque censento: urbis templa, vias, aquas, aerarium, vectigalia tuento: populique partes in tribus distribunto: exin pecunias, aevitates, ordines patiunto: equitum, peditumque prolem describunto: caelibes esse prohibento: mores populi regunto: probrum in senatu ne relinquunto.''\" This can be translated as: \"The Censors are to determine the generations, origins, families, and properties of the people; they are to (watch over/protect) the city's temples, roads, waters, treasury, and taxes; they are to divide the people into three parts; next, they are to (allow/approve) the properties, generations, and ranks [of the people]; they are to describe the offspring of knights and footsoldiers; they are to forbid being unmarried; they are to guide the behavior of the people; they are not to overlook abuse in the Senate.\" <!-- This translation is imperfect, if anyone can do it better please do -->\n\n===Census===\nThe Census, the first and principal duty of the censors, was always held in the [[Campus Martius]], and from the year 435 BC onwards, in a special building called [[Villa Publica]], which was erected for that purpose by the second pair of censors, [[Gaius Furius Pacilus Fusus]] and [[Marcus Geganius Macerinus]].<ref>Livy iv.22; [[Varro]] ''[[de Re Rustica]]'' iii.2.</ref>\n\nAn account of the formalities with which the census was opened is given in a fragment of the ''[[Tabulae Censoriae]]'', preserved by Varro.<ref>''De lingua Latina'' vi.86, 87, ed. M\u00fcller.</ref> After the [[auspices]] had been taken, the citizens were summoned by a public crier to appear before the censors. Each tribe was called up separately,<ref>Dionys. v.75.</ref> and the names in each tribe were probably taken according to the lists previously made out by the tribunes of the tribes. Every [[paterfamilias]] had to appear in person before the censors, who were seated in their [[curule chair]]s, and those names were taken first which were considered to be of good omen, such as [[Valerius]], [[Salvius]], [[Statorius]], etc.<ref>Festus, ''s.v. Lacus Lucrinus''; Schol. Bob. ''ad Cic. pro Scaur.'' p374, ed. Orelli.</ref>\n\nThe census was conducted according to the judgment of the censor (''ad arbitrium censoris''), but the censors laid down certain rules,<ref>Livy iv.8, xxix.15.</ref> sometimes called ''leges censui censendo'',<ref>Liv. xliii.14.</ref> in which mention was made of the different kinds of property subject to the census, and in what way their value was to be estimated. According to these laws, each citizen had to give an account of himself, of his family, and of his property upon oath, \"declared from the heart\".<ref>[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus|Dionysius]] iv.15; Livy xliii.14.</ref>\n\nFirst he had to give his full name ([[praenomen]], [[Roman naming conventions|nomen]], and [[cognomen]]) and that of his father, or if he were a ''[[Libertus]]'' (\"freedman\") that of his [[Patronage in ancient Rome|patron]], and he was likewise obliged to state his age. He was then asked, \"You, declaring from your heart, do you have a wife?\" and if married he had to give the name of his wife, and likewise the number, names, and ages of his children, if any.<ref>Gell. iv.20; Cicero ''[[de Oratore]]'' ii.64; Tab. Heracl. 142 (68); ''[[Digesta Iustiniani]]'' 50 tit.15 s3.</ref> Single women and orphans were represented by their guardians; their names were entered in separate lists, and they were not included in the sum total of heads.<ref>cf. Livy iii.3, ''[[Periochae]]'' 59.</ref>\n\nAfter a citizen had stated his name, age, family, etc., he then had to give an account of all his property, so far as it was subject to the census. Only such things were liable to the census (''censui censendo'') as were property according to the [[Quiritarian]] law. At first, each citizen appears to have merely given the value of his whole property in general without entering into details;<ref>Dionysius iv.15; Cicero ''[[de Legibus]]'' iii.3; Festus, s.v. ''Censores''.</ref> but it soon became the practice to give a minute specification of each article, as well as the general value of the whole.<ref>cf. Cicero ''pro Flacc.'' 32; Gell. vii.11; Plutarch ''[[Life of Cato the Elder]]'' 18.</ref>\n\nLand formed the most important article of the census, but public land, the possession of which only belonged to a citizen<!-- ??? -->, was excluded as not being [[Quiritarian]] property. If we may judge from the practice of the imperial period, it was the custom to give a most minute specification of all such land as a citizen held according to the Quiritarian law. He had to state the name and location of the land, and to specify what portion of it was arable, what meadow, what vineyard, and what olive-ground: and of the land thus described, he had to give his assessment of its value.<ref>''Digesta Iustiniani'' 50 tit.15 s4.</ref>\n\n[[Slavery|Slave]]s and cattle formed the next most important item. The censors also possessed the right of calling for a return of such objects as had not usually been given in, such as clothing, jewels, and carriages.<ref name=\"autogeneratedxxxix\">Livy xxxix.44; Plutarch ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 18.</ref> It has been doubted by some modern writers whether the censors possessed the power of setting a higher valuation on the property than the citizens themselves gave, but when we recollect the discretionary nature of the censors' powers, and the necessity almost that existed, in order to prevent fraud, that the right of making a surcharge should be vested in somebody's hands, we can hardly doubt that the censors had this power. It is moreover expressly stated that on one occasion they made an extravagant surcharge on articles of luxury;<ref name=\"autogeneratedxxxix\"/> and even if they did not enter in their books the property of a person at a higher value than he returned it, they accomplished the same end by compelling him to pay a tax upon the property at a higher rate than others. The tax was usually one per thousand upon the property entered in the books of the censors, but on one occasion the censors compelled a person to pay eight per thousand as a punishment.<ref>Livy iv.24.</ref>\n\nA person who voluntarily absented himself from the census was considered ''incensus'' and subject to the severest punishment. [[Servius Tullius]] is said to have threatened such individuals with imprisonment and death,<ref>Livy i.44.</ref> and in the [[Roman Republic|Republican]] period he might be sold by the state as a slave<ref>Cicero ''[[pro Caecina Oratio]]'' 34.</ref> In the later times of the republic, a person who was absent from the census might be represented by another, and be thus registered by the censors.<ref>Varro ''De lingua Latina'' vi.86.</ref> Whether the soldiers who were absent on service had to appoint a representative is uncertain. In ancient times, the sudden outbreaks of war prevented the census from being taken,<ref>Livy vi.31.</ref> because a large number of the citizens would necessarily be absent. It is supposed from a passage in Livy<ref>xxix.37.</ref> that in later times the censors sent commissioners into the provinces with full powers to take the census of the Roman soldiers there, but this seems to have been a special case. It is, on the contrary, probable from the way in which Cicero pleads the absence of Archias from [[Rome]] with the army under [[Lucullus]], as a sufficient reason for his not having been enrolled in the census,<ref>''[[pro Licinio Archia]]'' 5.</ref> that service in the army was a valid excuse for absence.\n\nAfter the censors had received the names of all the citizens with the amount of their property, they then had to make out the lists of the tribes, and also of the classes and centuries; for by the legislation of Servius Tullius the position of each citizen in the state was determined by the amount of his property (Comitia Centuriata). These lists formed a most important part of the Tabulae Censoriae, under which name were included all the documents connected in any way with the discharge of the censors' duties.<ref>Cicero de Legibus iii.3; Liv. xxiv.18; Plut. Cat. Maj. 16; Cic. de Leg. Agr. i.2.</ref> These lists, insofar as they were connected with the finances of the state, were deposited in the aerarium, which was the temple of Saturn;<ref>Liv. xxix.37.</ref> but the regular depositary for all the archives of the censors was in earlier times the Atrium Libertatis, near the Villa publica,<ref>Liv. xliii.16, xlv.15.</ref> and in later times the temple of the Nymphs.<ref>Cic. pro Mil. 27.</ref>\n\nBesides the division of the citizens into tribes, centuries, and classes, the censors had also to make out the lists of the [[Roman Senate|senators]] for the ensuing five years, or until new censors were appointed; striking out the names of such as they considered unworthy, and making additions to the body from those who were qualified. In the same manner they held a review of the [[Equites|Equestrian]]s who received a horse from public funds (''equites equo publico''), and added and removed names as they judged proper. They also confirmed the [[princeps senatus]], or appointed a new one. The princeps himself had to be a former censor.\n\nAfter the lists had been completed, the number of citizens was counted up, and the sum total announced.  Accordingly, we find that in the account of a census, the number of citizens is likewise usually given. They are in such cases spoken of as ''capita'' (\"heads\"), sometimes with the addition of the word ''civium'' (\"of the citizens\"), and sometimes not.  Hence, to be registered in the census was the same thing as \"having a head\" (''caput habere'').\n\n====Census beyond Rome====\nA census was sometimes taken in the provinces, even under the republic.<ref>Cicero ''[[In Verrem]]'' ii.53, 56.</ref> The Emperor sent into the provinces special officers called Censitores to take the census;<ref>Dig. 50 tit.15 s4 \u00a7 1; Cassiod. Var. ix.11; Orelli, Inscr. No. 3652.</ref> but the duty was sometimes discharged by the Imperial legati.<ref>[[Tacitus]] Ann. i.31, ii.6.</ref> The Censitores were assisted by subordinate officers, called Censuales, who made out the lists, etc..<ref>Capitol. Gordian. 12; Symmach. Ep. x.43; Cod. Theod. 8 tit.2.</ref> In Rome, the census was still taken under the empire, but the old ceremonies connected with it were no longer performed, and the ceremony of the lustration was not performed after the time of Vespasian. The jurists [[Julius Paulus Prudentissimus|Paulus]] and [[Ulpian]] each wrote works on the census in the imperial period; and several extracts from these works are given in a chapter in the ''Digest'' (50 15). <!-- Could we link this digest? -->\n\n====Other uses of census====\nThe word ''census'', besides the conventional meaning of \"valuation\" of a person's estate, has other meaning in Rome; it could refer to: \n*the amount of a person's property (hence we read of ''census senatorius'', the estate of a senator; ''census equestris'', the estate of an [[Equites|eques]]).\n*the lists of the censors.\n*the tax which depended upon the valuation in the census. The Lexicons will supply examples of these meanings. <!-- Huh? What does this second sentence mean? -->\n\n===''Regimen morum''===\nKeeping the public morals (''regimen morum'', or in the [[Roman Empire|empire]] ''cura morum'' or ''praefectura morum'') was the second most <!-- I say second most, since conducting the census was the first most important duty, as I read up above. --> important branch of the censors' duties, and the one which caused their office to be one of the most revered and the most dreaded in the Roman state; hence they were also known as ''Castigatores'' (\"chastisers\"). It naturally grew out of the right which they possessed of excluding  persons from the lists of citizens; for, as has been well remarked, \"they would, in the first place, be the sole judges of many questions of fact, such as whether a citizen had the qualifications required by law or custom for the rank which he claimed, or whether he had ever incurred any judicial sentence, which rendered him infamous: but from thence the transition was easy, according to Roman notions, to the decisions of questions of right; such as whether a citizen was really worthy of retaining his rank, whether he had not committed some act as justly degrading as those which incurred the sentence of the law.\" <!-- A source for this quote would be nice. -->\n\nIn this manner, the censors gradually assumed at least nominal complete superintendence over the whole public and private life of every citizen. They were constituted as the conservators of public morality; they were not simply to prevent crime or particular acts of immorality, but rather to maintain the traditional Roman character, ethics, and habits (''mos majorum'')\u2014''regimen morum'' also encompassed this protection of traditional ways,<ref>Cicero ''de Legibus'' iii.3; Livy iv.8, xxiv.18, xl.46, xli.27, xlii.3; Suetonius ''Life of Augustus'' 27.</ref> which was called in the times of the [[Roman Empire|empire]] ''cura'' (\"supervision\") or ''praefectura'' (\"command\"). The punishment inflicted by the censors in the exercise of this branch of their duties was called ''nota'' (\"mark, letter\") or ''notatio'', or ''animadversio censoria'' (\"censorial reproach\"). In inflicting it, they were guided only by their conscientious convictions of duty; they had to take an oath that they would act biased by neither partiality nor favour; and, in addition to this, they were bound in every case to state in their lists, opposite the name of the guilty citizen, the cause of the punishment inflicted on him, ''Subscriptio censoria''.<ref>Livy xxxix.42; Cicero ''[[pro Cluentio Oratio]]'' 42\u201148; Gell. iv.20.</ref>\n\nThis part of the censors' office invested them with a peculiar kind of jurisdiction, which in many respects resembled the exercise of public opinion in modern times; for there are innumerable actions which, though acknowledged by every one to be prejudicial and immoral, still do not come within the reach of the positive laws of a country; as often said, \"immorality does not equal illegality\". Even in cases of real crimes, the positive laws frequently punish only the particular offence, while in public opinion the offender, even after he has undergone punishment, is still incapacitated for certain honours and distinctions which are granted only to persons of unblemished character.\n\nHence the Roman censors might brand a man with their \"censorial mark\" (''nota censoria'') in case he had been convicted of a crime in an ordinary court of justice, and had already suffered punishment for it. The consequence of such a nota was only ''[[ignominia]]'' and not ''[[infamia]]''.<ref>Cicero ''[[de Re Publica]]'' iv.6.</ref> ''Infamia'' and the censorial verdict was not a ''judicium'' or ''res judicata'',<ref>Cicero ''pro Cluentio Oratio'' 42.</ref> for its effects were not lasting, but might be removed by the following censors, or by a ''[[List of Roman laws|lex]]'' (roughly \"law\"). A censorial mark was moreover not valid unless both censors agreed. The ''ignominia'' was thus only a transitory reduction of status, which does not even appear to have deprived a magistrate of his office,<ref>(Livy xxiv.18.</ref> and certainly did not disqualify persons labouring under it for obtaining a magistracy, for being appointed as ''judices'' by the [[praetor]], or for serving in the [[Roman army|Roman armies]]. [[Mamercus Aemilius Mamercinus]] was thus, notwithstanding the reproach of the censors (''animadversio censoria''), made [[Roman dictator|dictator]].<ref>Livy iv.31.</ref>\n\nA person might be branded with a censorial mark in a variety of cases, which it would be impossible to specify, as in a great many instances it depended upon the discretion of the censors and the view they took of a case; and sometimes even one set of censors would overlook an offence which was severely chastised by their successors.<ref>Cicero ''[[de Senectute]]'' 12.</ref> But the offences which are recorded to have been punished by the censors are of a threefold nature.\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Such as occurred in the private life of individuals, e.g.\n<ol type=\"a\"><li>Living in celibacy at a time when a person ought to be married to provide the state with citizens.<ref>Valerius Maximus ii.9 \u00a71.</ref> The obligation of marrying was frequently impressed upon the citizens by the censors, and the refusal to fulfil it was punished with a fine (''[[aes uxorium]]'').\n<li>The dissolution of matrimony or betrothment in an improper way, or for insufficient reasons.<ref>Valerius Maximus ii.9 \u00a72.</ref>\n<li>Improper conduct towards one's wife or children, as well as harshness or too great indulgence towards children, and disobedience of the latter towards their parents.<ref>Plutarch ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 17; cf.

A great many instances of this kind are recorded.<ref>Livy ''Periochae'' 14, xxxix.4; Plutarch ''Life of Cato the Elder'' 18; Gellius, iv.8; Valerius Maximus ii.9 \u00a74.</ref> At a later time the ''[[Sumptuary laws|leges sumptuariae]]'' were made to check the growing love of luxuries.\n<li>Neglect and carelessness in cultivating one's fields.<ref>Auli Gellii iv.12; Pliny ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' xviii.3.</ref> \n<li>Cruelty towards slaves or clients.<ref>Dionysius xx.3.</ref>\n<li>The carrying on of a disreputable trade or occupation,<ref>Dionysius, l.c.</ref> such as acting in theatres.<ref>Livy vii.2.</ref>\n<li>Legacy-hunting, defrauding orphans, etc.</ol>\n<li>Offences committed in public life, either in the capacity of a public officer or against magistrates,\n<ol type=\"a\"><li>If a magistrate acted in a manner not befitting his dignity as an officer, if he was accessible to bribes, or forged auspices.<ref>Cicero ''[[de Senectute]]'' 12; Livy xxxix. 42; Valerius Maximus ii. 9. \u00a7 3; Plutarch ''Cato Major'' 17; Cicero ''[[De Divinatione]]'' i. 16.</ref>\n<li>Improper conduct towards a magistrate, or the attempt to limit his power or to abrogate a law which the censors thought necessary.<ref>Livy iv. 24; Cicero ''[[de Oratore]]'' ii. 64; Valerius Maximus ii. 9. \u00a7 5; Gellius, iv. 20.</ref>\n<li>Perjury.<ref>Cicero ''[[de Oratore]]'' i. 13; Livy xxiv. 18; Gellius vii. 18.</ref>\n<li>Neglect, disobedience, and cowardice of soldiers in the army.<ref>Valerius Maximux ii. 9. \u00a7 7; Livy. xxiv. 18, xxvii. 11.</ref>\n<li>The keeping of the [[equus publicus]] (a horse kept by patrician equestrian militia at public expense) in bad condition.</ol>\n<li>A variety of actions or pursuits which were thought to be injurious to public morality, might be forbidden by an edict,<ref>Gellius, xv.11.</ref> and those who acted contrary to such edicts were branded with the nota and degraded. For an enumeration of the offences that might be punished by the censors with ''ignominia'', see Niebuhr.<ref>''History of Rome'', vol. ii p399, &c.</ref></ol>\n\nA person who had been branded with a ''nota censoria'', might, if he considered himself wronged, endeavour to prove his innocence to the censors,<ref>''causam agere apud censores'', Varro ''de re Rustica'' i.7.</ref> and if he did not succeed, he might try to gain the protection of one of the censors, that he might intercede on his behalf.\n\n====Punishments====\nThe punishments inflicted by the censors generally differed according to the station which a man occupied, though sometimes a person of the highest rank might suffer all the punishments at once, by being degraded to the lowest class of citizens. But they are generally divided into four classes:\n\n#''Motio'' (\"removal\") or ''ejectio e senatu'' (\"ejection from the Senate\"), or the exclusion of a man from the ranks of senators. This punishment might either be a simple exclusion from the list of senators, or the person might at the same time be excluded from the tribes and degraded to the rank of an aerarian.<ref>Liv. xxiv.18.</ref> The latter course seems to have been seldom adopted; the ordinary mode of inflicting the punishment was simply this: the censors in their new lists omitted the names of such senators as they wished to exclude, and in reading these new lists in public, quietly omitted the names of those who were no longer to be senators. Hence the expression ''praeteriti senatores'' (\"senators passed over\") is equivalent to ''e senatu ejecti'' (those removed from the senate).<ref>Livy xxxviii.28, xxvii.11, xxxiv.44; Festus, s.v. Praeteriti.</ref><br>In some cases, however, the censors did not acquiesce to this simple mode of proceeding, but addressed the senator whom they had noted, and publicly reprimanded him for his conduct.<ref>Livy xxiv.18.</ref> As, however, in ordinary cases an ex-senator was not disqualified by his ''ignominia'' for holding any of the magistracies which opened the way to the senate, he might at the next census again become a senator.<ref>Cicero ''pro Cluentio Oratio'' 42, Plutarch ''Life of Cicero'' 17.</ref>\n#The ''ademptio equi'', or the taking away the publicly funded horse from an [[Equites|equestrian]].  This punishment might likewise be simple, or combined with the exclusion from the tribes and the degradation to the rank of an [[Aerarii|aerarian]].<ref>Livy xxiv.18, 43, xxvii.11, xxix.37, xliii.16.</ref>\n#The ''motio e tribu'', or the exclusion of a person from his tribe. This punishment and the degradation to the rank of an aerarian were originally the same; but when in the course of time a distinction was made between the rural or rustic tribes and the urban tribes, the ''motio e tribu'' transferred a person from the rustic tribes to the less respectable city tribes, and if the further degradation to the rank of an aerarian was combined with the ''motio e tribu'', it was always expressly stated.<ref>Liv. xlv.15, Plin. H.N. xviii.3.</ref>\n#The fourth punishment was called ''referre in aerarios''<ref>Livy xxiv.18; Cicero ''pro Cluentio Oratio'' 43.</ref> or ''facere aliquem aerarium'',<ref>Livy xliii.43.</ref> and might be inflicted on any person who was thought by the censors to deserve it. This degradation, properly speaking, included all the other punishments, for an equestrian could not be made an ''aerarius'' unless he was previously deprived of his horse, nor could a member of a rustic tribe be made an ''aerarius'' unless he was previously excluded from it.<ref>Livy iv.24, xxiv.18, &c.</ref>\n\nIt was this authority of the Roman censors which eventually developed into the modern meaning of \"censor\" and \"[[censorship]]\"\u2014i.e., officials who review published material and forbid the publication of material judged to be contrary to \"public morality\" as the term is interpreted in a given political and social environment.\n\n===Administration of the finances of the state===\nThe administration of the state's finances was another part of the censors' office. In the first place the ''[[tributum]]'', or property-tax, had to be paid by each citizen according to the amount of his property registered in the census, and, accordingly, the regulation of this tax naturally fell under the jurisdiction of the censors.<ref>cf. Livy xxxix.44.</ref> They also had the superintendence of all the other revenues of the state, the ''[[vectigalia]]'', such as the tithes paid for the public lands, the [[salt]] works, the mines, the customs, etc.\n\nThe censors typically auctioned off to the highest bidder for the space of a ''lustrum'' the collection of the tithes and taxes ([[tax farming]]). This auctioning was called ''venditio'' or ''locatio'', and seems to have taken place in the month of March,<ref>[[Macrobius]] ''[[Macrobius#Saturnalia|Saturnalia]]'' i.12.</ref> in a public place in Rome<ref>Cicero ''de Lege Agraria'' i.3, ii.21.</ref> The terms on which they were let, together with the rights and duties of the purchasers, were all specified in the ''leges censoriae'', which the censors published in every case before the bidding commenced.<ref>Cicero ''ad Qu. Fr.'' i.1 \u00a712, ''[[In Verrem]]'' iii.7, ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' iii.19, Varro ''de re rustica'' ii.1.</ref> For further particulars see [[Publicani]].\n\nThe censors also possessed the right, though probably not without the assent of the Senate, of imposing new ''vectigalia'',<ref>Livy xxix.37, xl.51.</ref> and even of selling the land belonging to the state.<ref>Livy xxxii.7.</ref> It would thus appear that it was the duty of the censors to bring forward a budget for a five-year period, and to take care that the income of the state was sufficient for its expenditure during that time. In part, their duties resembled those of a modern [[minister of finance]]. The censors, however, did not receive the revenues of the state. All the public money was paid into the ''[[aerarium]]'', which was entirely under the jurisdiction of the senate; and all disbursements were made by order of this body, which employed the [[quaestor]]s as its officers.\n\nIn one important department the censors were entrusted with the expenditure of the public money, though the actual payments were no doubt made by the quaestors. The censors had the general superintendence of all the public buildings and works (''opera publica''), and to meet the expenses connected with this part of their duties, the senate voted them a certain sum of money or certain revenues, to which they were restricted, but which they might at the same time employ according to their discretion.<ref>[[Polybius]] vi.13; Livy xl.46, xliv.16.</ref> They had to see that the temples and all other public buildings were in a good state of repair,<ref>''[[Aedes (Roman religion)|aedes]] sacras tueri'' and ''sarta tecta exigere'', Livy xxiv.18, xxix.37, xlii.3, xlv.15.</ref> that no public places were encroached upon by the occupation of private persons,<ref>''loca tueri'', Livy xlii.3, xliii.16.</ref> and that the [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]], roads, drains, etc. were properly attended to.\n\nThe repairs of the public works and the keeping of them in proper condition were let out by the censors by [[public auction]] to the lowest bidder, just as the ''vectigalia'' were let out to the highest bidder. These expenses were called ''[[ultrotributa]]'', and hence we frequently find ''vectigalia'' and ''ultrotributa'' contrasted with one another.<ref>Livy xxxix.44, xliii.16.</ref> The persons who undertook the contract were called ''conductores'', ''mancipes'', ''redemptores'', ''susceptores'', etc.; and the duties they had to discharge were specified in the [[Leges Censoriae]]. The censors had also to superintend the expenses connected with the worship of the gods, even for instance the feeding of the sacred geese in the Capitol; these various tasks were also let out on contract.<ref>Plutarch ''[[Roman Questions]]'' 98; Pliny ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' x.22; Cicero ''[[pro Sexto Roscio Amerino Oratio]]'' 20.</ref> It was ordinary for censors to expend large amounts of money (\u201cby far the largest and most extensive\u201d of the state)<ref>Polybius 6.13.3</ref> in their public works.\n\nBesides keeping existing public buildings and facilities in a proper state of repair, the censors were also in charge of constructing new ones, either for ornament or utility, both in Rome and in other parts of Italy, such as temples, [[basilica]]e, [[theatre]]s, porticoes, [[Roman Forum|fora]], walls of towns, [[Aqueduct (Roman)|aqueducts]], harbours, bridges, cloacae, roads, etc. These works were either performed by them jointly, or they divided between them the money, which had been granted to them by the senate.<ref>Liv. xl.51, xliv.16.</ref> They were let out to contractors, like the other works mentioned above, and when they were completed, the censors had to see that the work was performed in accordance with the contract: this was called ''opus probare'' or ''in acceptum referre''.<ref>Cicero ''In Verrem'' i.57; Livy iv.22, xlv.15; Lex Puteol. p73, Spang.</ref>\n\nThe [[aedile]]s had likewise a superintendence over the public buildings, and it is not easy to define with accuracy the respective duties of the censors and aediles, but it may be remarked in general that the superintendence of the aediles had more of a police character, while that of the censors were more financial in subject matter.\n\n===Lustrum===\nAfter the censors had performed their various duties and taken the five-yearly census, the ''[[lustrum]]'', a solemn purification of the people, followed. When the censors entered upon their office, they drew lots to see which of them should perform this purification;<ref>''lustrum facere'' or ''condere'', Varro ''De lingua Latina'' vi.86; Livy xxix.37, xxxv.9, xxxviii.36, xlii.10.</ref> but both censors were of course obliged to be present at the ceremony.\n\nLong after the Roman census was no longer taken, the Latin word ''lustrum'' has survived, and been adopted in some modern languages, in the derived sense of a period of five years, i.e. half a decennium.\n\n==Census statistics==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=\"70\"|Census\n!width=\"90\"|Population{{specify|reason=Roman citizens?

The intersection of all convex sets containing a given subset {{mvar|A}} of Euclidean space is called the [[convex hull]] of {{mvar|A}}. It is the smallest convex set containing {{mvar|A}}.\n\nA [[convex function]] is a [[real-valued function]] defined on an [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] with the property that its [[epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]] (the set of points on or above the [[graph of a function|graph]] of the function) is a convex set. [[Convex minimization]] is a subfield of [[mathematical optimization|optimization]] that studies the problem of minimizing convex functions over convex sets. The branch of mathematics devoted to the study of properties of convex sets and convex functions is called [[convex analysis]].\n\nThe notion of a convex set can be generalized as described below.\n\n== In vector spaces ==\n[[File:Convex supergraph.svg|right|thumb|A [[convex function|function]] is convex if and only if its [[Epigraph (mathematics)|epigraph]], the region (in green) above its [[graph of a function|graph]] (in blue), is a convex set.]]\nLet {{mvar|S}} be a [[vector space]] over the [[real number]]s, or, more generally, over some [[ordered field]]. This includes Euclidean spaces. A [[set (mathematics)|set]] {{mvar|C}} in {{mvar|S}} is said to be '''convex''' if, for all {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|C}} and all {{mvar|t}} in the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{math|(0, 1)}}, the point {{math|(1 \u2212 ''t'')''x'' + ''ty''}} also belongs to {{mvar|C}}. In other words, every point on the [[line segment]] connecting {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} is in {{mvar|C}}. This implies that a convex set in a [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] [[topological vector space]] is [[path-connected]], thus [[connected space|connected]].\nFurthermore, {{mvar|C}} is strictly convex if every point on the line segment connecting {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} other than the endpoints is inside the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of {{mvar|C}}.\n\nA set {{mvar|C}} is called [[absolutely convex]] if it is convex and [[balanced set|balanced]].\n\nThe convex [[subset]]s of {{math|'''R'''}} (the set of real numbers) are the intervals of {{math|'''R'''}}. Some examples of convex subsets of the [[Euclidean space|Euclidean plane]] are solid [[regular polygon]]s, solid triangles, and intersections of solid triangles. Some examples of convex subsets of a [[Euclidean space|Euclidean 3-dimensional space]] are the [[Archimedean solid]]s and the [[Platonic solid]]s.

The common name \"generalized convexity\" is used, because the resulting objects retain certain properties of convex sets.\n\n=== Star-convex (Star-shaped) sets ===\n{{main|Star domain}}\nLet {{mvar|C}} be a set in a real or complex vector space. {{mvar|C}} is '''star convex (star-shaped)''' if there exists an {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} in {{mvar|C}} such that the line segment from {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} to any point {{mvar|y}} in {{mvar|C}} is contained in {{mvar|C}}. Hence a non-empty convex set is always star-convex but a star-convex set is not always convex.\n\n=== Orthogonal convexity ===\n{{main|Orthogonal convex hull}}\nAn example of generalized convexity is '''orthogonal convexity'''.<ref>Rawlins G.J.E. and Wood D, \"Ortho-convexity and its generalizations\",  in: ''Computational Morphology'', 137-152. [[Elsevier]], 1988.</ref>\n\nA set {{mvar|S}} in the Euclidean space is called '''orthogonally convex''' or '''ortho-convex''', if any segment parallel to any of the coordinate axes connecting two points of {{mvar|S}} lies totally within {{mvar|S}}. It is easy to prove that an intersection of any collection of orthoconvex sets is orthoconvex. Some other properties of convex sets are  valid as well.\n\n=== Non-Euclidean geometry ===\nThe definition of a convex set and a convex hull extends naturally to geometries which are not Euclidean by defining a [[geodesic convexity|geodesically convex set]] to be one that contains the [[geodesic]]s joining any two points in the set.\n\n=== Order topology ===\nConvexity can be extended for a space {{mvar|X}} endowed with the [[order topology]], using the [[total order]] {{math|<}} of the space.<ref>[[James Munkres|Munkres, James]]; ''Topology'', Prentice Hall; 2nd edition (December 28, 1999). {{ISBN|0-13-181629-2}}.</ref>\n\nLet {{math|''Y'' \u2286 ''X''}}. The subspace {{mvar|Y}} is a convex set if for each pair of points {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{mvar|Y}} such that {{math|''a'' < ''b''}}, the interval {{math|(''a'', ''b'') {{=}} {''x'' \u2208 ''X'' : ''a'' < ''x'' < ''b''} }} is contained in {{mvar|Y}}. That is, {{mvar|Y}} is convex if and only if for all {{math|''a'', ''b''}} in {{mvar|Y}}, {{math|''a'' < ''b''}} implies {{math|(''a'', ''b'') \u2286 ''Y''}}.\n\n=== Convexity spaces ===\nThe notion of convexity may be generalised to other objects, if certain properties of convexity are selected as [[axiom]]s.\n\nGiven a set {{mvar|X}}, a '''convexity''' over {{mvar|X}} is a collection {{math|''\ud835\udc9e''}} of subsets of {{mvar|X}} satisfying the following axioms:<ref name=\"Soltan\"/><ref name=\"Singer\"/><ref name=\"vanDeVel\" >{{cite book|last=van De Vel|first=Marcel L.

This fortress, known as [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]], was the nucleus of the Roman and then the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city and is the oldest structure in the city today. It is also situated at the nucleus of the [[Coptic Orthodox]] community, which separated from the Roman and Byzantine churches in the late 4th century. Many of Cairo's oldest Coptic churches, including the [[Hanging Church]], are located along the fortress walls in a section of the city known as [[Coptic Cairo]].\n\nFollowing the Muslim conquest in 640 AD, the conqueror [[Amr ibn As]] settled to the north of the Babylon in an area that became known as [[al-Fustat]]. Originally a tented camp (''Fustat'' signifies \"City of Tents\") Fustat became a permanent settlement and the first capital of Islamic Egypt.\n\nIn 750, following the overthrow of the [[Ummayad caliphate]] by the [[Abbasid]]s, the new rulers created their own settlement to the northeast of Fustat which became their capital. This was known as [[al-Askar]] (the city of sections, or [[cantonment]]s) as it was laid out like a military camp.\n\nA rebellion in 869 by [[Ahmad ibn Tulun]] led to the abandonment of Al Askar and the building of another settlement, which became the seat of government. This was [[al-Qatta'i]] (\"the Quarters\"), to the north of Fustat and closer to the river. Al Qatta'i was centred around a palace and ceremonial mosque, now known as the [[Mosque of ibn Tulun]].\n\nIn 905, the Abbasids re-asserted control of the country and their governor returned to Fustat, razing al-Qatta'i to the ground.\nSince 1860s, Cairo  expanded west as far as what is called now (Midan Opera)\n\n===Foundation and expansion===\n{{Further|Egypt in the Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Al-Hakim.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Fresco of Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Al-Hakim]] (985\u20131021)]]\nIn 968, the Fatimids were led by general [[Jawhar (general)|Jawhar al-Siqilli]] to establish a new capital for the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org/hcp/egypt.asp |title=Egypt \u2013 Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme |publisher= |accessdate=29 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821215722/http://www.akdn.org/hcp/egypt.asp |archivedate= 21 August 2011 |df= }}</ref> Egypt was conquered from their base in [[Ifriqiya]] and a new fortified city northeast of [[Fustat]] was established.

The Travels of Ibn Battuta, p. 13, 225. Trans. Samuel Lee. Cosimo, 2009. Print.</ref> Ibn Battuta traveled thousands of miles during the course of his trek. One city he stopped in was Cairo, Egypt. One significant note Ibn Battuta made was that Cairo was the principal district of Egypt, meaning Cairo was Egypt's most important and most influential city (Ibn Battuta, 2009). Ibn Battuta also acknowledges the importance of the Nile river to all of Egypt, including Cairo, as he often traveled via boat to arrive at Cairo and to leave to continue his journey. The Nile was not just a means for transportation, it was the source of a plethora of other tangibles as well. The Nile's most influential attribute was its ability to sustain rich soil for agriculture. Part of the Agricultural Revolution thrived in Egypt, predominantly off the back of the Nile. The Nile also served as a source of food and a pathway for trade. Without it, the Egypt we know today wouldn't have been the same. One of Ibn Battuta's most detailed accounts in Cairo involves a plague that was devastating the city. Today, this plague is known as the [[Bubonic Plague]], or the Black Death. It is believed to have arrived in Egypt in 1347, and as Ibn Battuta recalls, the Bubonic plague was responsible for the deaths of between 1 and 20,000 people a day in Cairo <ref>The Travels of Ibn Battuta. UC Berkeley: Berkeley ORIAS, 2018. Electronic.</ref>(Berkeley ORIAS, 2018) (Ibn Battuta, 2009). The plague originated in Asia and spread via flees on rodents, such as rats (Berkeley ORIAS, 2018). The plague would end up spreading to all of Eurasia and wiped out any civilizations that were in its path. It is estimated that somewhere between 75 and 200 million people total died from the plague.\n\n===Ottoman rule===\n{{Further|History of Ottoman Egypt}}\n{{See also|Muhammad Ali's seizure of power}}\n[[File:Georg Macco Kairo.jpg|thumb|Cairo in the 19th century]]\nAlthough Cairo avoided [[Europe]]'s stagnation during the [[Late Middle Ages]], it could not escape the [[Black Death]], which struck the city more than fifty times between 1348 and 1517.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=4}}</ref> During its initial, and most deadly waves, approximately 200,000 people were killed by the plague,<ref>{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=104\u20135}}</ref> and, by the 15th century, Cairo's population had been reduced to between 150,000 and 300,000.<ref>{{harvnb|Shoshan|2002|p=1}}</ref> The city's status was further diminished after [[Vasco da Gama]] discovered a sea route around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] between 1497 and 1499, thereby allowing spice traders to avoid Cairo.<ref name=\"sh199\"/>\nCairo's political influence diminished significantly after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] supplanted [[Mamluk]] power over [[Egypt]] in 1517.

Concurrently, Cairo has established itself as a political and economic hub for [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world]], with many multinational businesses and organisations, including the [[Arab League]], operating out of the city.\n\nIn 1992, Cairo was hit by an [[1992 Cairo earthquake|earthquake]] causing 545 deaths, 6,512 injuries and 50,000 people homeless.<ref name=\"NGDC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/nndc/struts/results?eq_0=5339&t=101650&s=13&d=22,26,13,12&nd=display|title=NGDC page on the Cairo earthquake|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nToday, Cairo serves as the national capital of Egypt, so it is fair to say it still holds major importance. Many things have changed since Ibn Battuta trekked through the city during his travels. Today, Cairo has taken a major step forward in urbanization as most Cairenes now live in apartment buildings. Because of the influx of people in the city, lone standing houses are rare to find, and apartment buildings accommodate for the limited space and abundance of people. In fact, lone standing houses are symbolic of the wealthy. Formal education has also become very important to those in the city of Cairo. Just as in the United States, there are twelve years of formal education. Cairenes also take an apprehension test similar to the SAT to help them further their education and become accepted to a higher institution. However, most children do not finish school and opt to pick up a trade to enter the work force.<ref>Life in Modern Cairo. The University of Texas at Austin-College of Liberal Arts, Electronic.</ref> The civil rights movement for women in Cairo has been a long and troubling battle for many years now. Women face constant discrimination, harassment, and abuse throughout Cairo. The situation is so bad in Cairo that it has even been named the most dangerous megacity for women in the world <ref>Cairo 'Most Dangerous' Megacity for Women-Survey. BBC News, 2017. Electronic.</ref>(BBC News, 2017).  Cairo has also been influenced by modern western civilization. As one travels through modern Cairo, it is not unusual to come across McDonald's, Arby's, Pizza Hut, Subway, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. There are even large scale western restaurants in Cairo, such as Chili's and T.G.I. Friday's. Of course, the majority of restaurants serve Egyptian and Middle Eastern dishes, but the fact remains that certain aspects of western civilization have crossed the Atlantic and reached the city of Cairo. Sadly, Egypt is one of the poorer countries in the Middle East, with almost half the population living on $2 or less a day <ref>Mitchell Hartman. On Rich and Poor in Egypt. Marketplace, 2011. Electronic.</ref>(Hartman, 2011). However, from the income the country does make, most of it does come from Cairo, as the majority of the countries manufacturing headquarters are located there. Today's Cairo has clearly evolved since Ibn Battuta made his way through the ancient city. Cairo has made advances in some aspects of daily life, and taken steps backwards in others. However, with that being said, Cairo is still one of the most influential cities in all of Egypt.\n[[File:The lion of Egyptian revolution (Qasr al-Nil Bridge)-edit2.jpg|left|thumb|upright|A protester holding an Egyptian flag during the protests that started on 25 January 2011]]\n\n====2011 Egyptian revolution====\n{{Main|Egyptian revolution of 2011}}\nCairo's [[Tahrir Square]] was the focal point of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] against former president [[Hosni Mubarak]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12289475 |title=Egypt protests: Anti-Mubarak demonstrators arrested |date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}</ref> Over 2 million protesters were at Cairo's Tahrir square.

Over the years, the Nile gradually shifted westward, providing the site between the eastern edge of the river and the [[Mokattam]] highlands on which the city now stands. The land on which Cairo was established in 969 (present-day [[Islamic Cairo]]) was located underwater just over three hundred years earlier, when [[Fustat]] was first built.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|2002|p=125}}</ref>\n\nLow periods of the Nile during the 11th century continued to add to the landscape of Cairo; a new island, known as ''Geziret al-Fil'', first appeared in 1174, but eventually became connected to the mainland.

Egypt later won the competition and went on to win the next edition In Ghana (2008) making the Egyptian and Ghanaian national teams the only teams to win the African Nations Cup Back to back which resulted in Egypt winning the title for a record number of six times in the history of African Continental Competition. This was followed by a third consecutive win in Angola 2010, making Egypt the only country with a record 3-consecutive and 7-total Continental Football Competition winner. This achievement had also placed the Egyptian football team as the #9 best team in the world's FIFA rankings.\n\nCairo failed at the applicant stage when bidding for the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Summer Olympic Games]], which was hosted in Beijing, China.

Egypt currently has seven players in the top ten of the PSA men's world rankings, and three in the women's top ten. Mohamed El Shorbagy held the world number one position for more than a year before being overtaken by compatriot Karim Abdel Gawad, who is currently number two behind Gregory Gaultier of France. Ramy Ashour and Amr Shabana are regarded as two of the most talented squash players in history. Shabana won the World Open title four times and Ashour twice, although his recent form has been hampered by injury. Egypt's Nour El Sherbini has won the Women's World Championship twice and has been women's world number one for 16 consecutive months. On 30 April 2016, she became the youngest woman to win the Women's World Championship which was held in Malaysia.

These documents were written from about 870 to 1880 AD and have been archived in various American and European libraries. The Taylor-Schechter collection in the [[University of Cambridge]] runs to 140,000 manuscripts, a further 40,000 manuscripts are at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]].\n\n===Religion===\nMost residents are [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]], while the rest of the population is mostly Christian. Al-Azhar University, based in Cairo, is considered the leading authority of Sunni Islam worldwide. Most Christians are [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Orthodox]]. Until his death in March 2012, [[Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria]] was the leader of the Coptic Orthodox Church, followed by Pope Tawadros II who became Pope on 18 November 2012, whose residence is in Cairo. Cairo has several synagogues, but few [[Judaism|Jews]] remain after [[Israel]] was established and the subsequent [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries#Egypt|exodus]], largely due to state sponsored discrimination.

It was first named Ismailia Square, after the 19th-century ruler [[Khedive Ismail]], who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the Nile' design. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, though it was not officially renamed as such until after the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|1952 Revolution]] which eliminated the monarchy. Several notable buildings surround the square including, the [[American University in Cairo]]'s downtown campus, the [[Mogamma]] governmental administrative Building, the headquarters of the [[Arab League]], the Nile Ritz Carlton Hotel, and the [[Egyptian Museum]]. Being at the heart of Cairo, the square witnessed several major protests over the years.

The Mamluk sultans and elites were eager patrons of religious and scholarly life, commonly building religious or funerary complexes whose functions could include a mosque, [[madrasa]], [[khanqah]] (for [[Sufis]]), a [[Sebil (fountain)|sabil]] (water dispensary), and a mausoleum for themselves and their families.<ref>Behrens-Abouseif, Doris. 2007.

Chaotic systems are predictable for a while and then 'appear' to become random.<ref name=\"Boeing2016Systems\" /> The amount of time that the behavior of a chaotic system can be effectively predicted depends on three things: How much uncertainty can be tolerated in the forecast, how accurately its current state can be measured, and a time scale depending on the dynamics of the system, called the [[Lyapunov time]]. Some examples of Lyapunov times are: chaotic electrical circuits, about 1 millisecond; weather systems, a few  days (unproven); the solar system, 50 million years. In chaotic systems, the uncertainty in a forecast increases [[Exponential growth|exponentially]] with elapsed time. Hence, mathematically, doubling the forecast time more than squares the proportional uncertainty in the forecast. This means, in practice, a meaningful prediction cannot be made over an interval of more than two or three times the Lyapunov time. When meaningful predictions cannot be made, the system appears random.<ref>''Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order'', Steven Strogatz, Hyperion, New York, 2003, pages 189\u2013190.</ref>\n\n==Chaotic dynamics==\n[[File:Chaos Sensitive Dependence.svg|thumb|The map defined by <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">''x'' \u2192 4 ''x'' (1 \u2013 ''x'')</span> and <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">''y'' \u2192 (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1</span> displays sensitivity to initial x positions.

Within this picture, the long-range dynamical behavior associated with chaotic dynamics, e.g., the [[butterfly effect]], is a consequence of the [[Goldstone's theorem]] in the application to the spontaneous topological supersymmetry breaking.\n\n===Sensitivity to initial condition===\n{{Main|Butterfly effect}}\n[[File:SensInitCond.gif|thumb|Lorenz equations used to generate plots for the y variable. The initial conditions for ''x'' and ''z'' were kept the same but those for ''y'' were changed between '''1.001''', '''1.0001''' and '''1.00001'''. The values for <math>\\rho</math>, <math>\\sigma</math> and <math>\\beta</math> were '''45.92''', '''16''' and '''4 ''' respectively. As can be seen, even the slightest difference in initial values causes significant changes after about 12 seconds of evolution in the three cases. This is an example of sensitive dependence on initial conditions.]]\n'''Sensitivity to initial conditions''' means that each point in a chaotic system is arbitrarily closely approximated by other points with significantly different future paths, or trajectories. Thus, an arbitrarily small change, or perturbation, of the current trajectory may lead to significantly different future behavior.\n\nSensitivity to initial conditions is popularly known as the \"[[butterfly effect]]\", so-called because of the title of a paper given by [[Edward Lorenz]] in 1972 to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in Washington, D.C., entitled ''Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil set off a Tornado in Texas?''. The flapping wing represents a small change in the initial condition of the system, which causes a chain of events that prevents the predictability of large-scale phenomena. Had the butterfly not flapped its wings, the trajectory of the overall system would have been vastly different.\n\nA consequence of sensitivity to initial conditions is that if we start with a limited amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most prevalent in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead.<ref name=\"RGW\">{{cite book |author=Watts, Robert G. |title=Global Warming and the Future of the Earth |publisher=Morgan & Claypool |year=2007 |page=17 }}</ref> Of course, this does not mean that we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100&nbsp;\u00b0C or fall to \u2212130&nbsp;\u00b0C on earth (during the current [[geologic era]]), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.\n\nIn more mathematical terms, the [[Lyapunov exponent]] measures the sensitivity to initial conditions. Given two starting [[trajectory|trajectories]] in the [[phase space]] that are infinitesimally close, with initial separation <math>\\delta \\mathbf{Z}_0</math>, the two trajectories end up diverging at a rate given by\n\n:<math> | \\delta\\mathbf{Z}(t) | \\approx e^{\\lambda t} | \\delta \\mathbf{Z}_0 |,</math>\n\nwhere t is the time and \u03bb is the Lyapunov exponent. The rate of separation depends on the orientation of the initial separation vector, so a whole spectrum of Lyapunov exponents exist. The number of Lyapunov exponents is equal to the number of dimensions of the phase space, though it is common to just refer to the largest one. For example, the maximal Lyapunov exponent (MLE) is most often used because it determines the overall predictability of the system. A positive MLE is usually taken as an indication that the system is chaotic.\n\nAlso, other properties relate to sensitivity of initial conditions, such as [[Measure (mathematics)|measure-theoretical]] [[Mixing (mathematics)|mixing]] (as discussed in [[ergodicity|ergodic]] theory) and properties of a [[Kolmogorov automorphism|K-system]].<ref name=\"WerndlCharlotte\" />\n\n===Topological mixing===\n[[File:LogisticTopMixing1-6.gif|thumb|Six iterations of a set of states <math>[x,y]</math>  passed through the logistic map. (a) the blue plot (legend 1) shows the first iterate (initial condition), which essentially forms a circle. Animation shows the first to the sixth iteration of the circular initial conditions. It can be seen that ''mixing'' occurs as we progress in iterations. The sixth iteration shows that the points are almost completely scattered in the phase space. Had we progressed further in iterations, the mixing would have been homogeneous and irreversible. The logistic map has equation <math>x_{k+1} = 4  x_k  (1 - x_k )</math>. To expand the state-space of the logistic map into two dimensions,  a second state, <math>y</math>, was created as <math>y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k </math>, if <math>x_k + y_k <1</math> and <math>y_{k+1} = x_k + y_k -1</math> otherwise.]]\n[[File:Chaos Topological Mixing.png|thumb|The map defined by <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">''x'' \u2192 4 ''x'' (1 \u2013 ''x'')</span> and <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">''y'' \u2192 (''x'' + ''y)'' [[Modulo operation|mod]] 1</span> also displays [[topological mixing]]. Here, the blue region is transformed by the dynamics first to the purple region, then to the pink and red regions, and eventually to a cloud of vertical lines scattered across the space.]]\n\n'''[[Topological mixing]]''' (or '''topological transitivity''') means that the system evolves over time so that any given region or [[open set]] of its [[phase space]] eventually overlaps with any other given region. This mathematical concept of \"mixing\" corresponds to the standard intuition, and the mixing of colored [[dye]]s or fluids is an example of a chaotic system.\n\nTopological mixing is often omitted from popular accounts of chaos, which equate chaos with only sensitivity to initial conditions. However, sensitive dependence on initial conditions alone does not give chaos. For example, consider the simple dynamical system produced by repeatedly doubling an initial value. This system has sensitive dependence on initial conditions everywhere, since any pair of nearby points eventually becomes widely separated. However, this example has no topological mixing, and therefore has no chaos. Indeed, it has extremely simple behavior: all points except 0 tend to positive or negative infinity.\n\n===Density of periodic orbits===\nFor a chaotic system to have [[Dense set|dense]] [[periodic orbits]] means that every point in the space is approached arbitrarily closely by periodic orbits.<ref>{{harvnb|Devaney|2003}}</ref> The one-dimensional [[logistic map]] defined by <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">''x'' \u2192 4 ''x'' (1 \u2013 ''x'')</span> is one of the simplest systems with density of periodic orbits.

The cases of most interest arise when the chaotic behavior takes place on an [[attractor]], since then a large set of initial conditions leads to orbits that converge to this chaotic region.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Strelioff|first1=Christopher|last2=et.|first2=al.|title=Medium-Term Prediction of Chaos|journal=Phys.

Because of the topological transitivity condition, this is likely to produce a picture of the entire final attractor, and indeed both orbits shown in the figure on the right give a picture of the general shape of the Lorenz attractor.  This attractor results from a simple three-dimensional model of the [[Edward Lorenz|Lorenz]] weather system. The Lorenz attractor is perhaps one of the best-known chaotic system diagrams, probably because it was not only one of the first, but it is also one of the most complex and as such gives rise to a very interesting pattern that, with a little imagination, looks like the wings of a butterfly.\n\nUnlike [[Attractor#Fixed point|fixed-point attractors]] and [[limit cycle]]s, the attractors that arise from chaotic systems, known as [[strange attractor]]s, have great detail and complexity.  Strange attractors occur in both [[continuous function|continuous]] dynamical systems (such as the Lorenz system) and in some [[discrete mathematics|discrete]] systems (such as the [[H\u00e9non map]]). Other discrete dynamical systems have a repelling structure called a [[Julia set]], which forms at the boundary between basins of attraction of fixed points. Julia sets can be thought of as strange repellers. Both strange attractors and Julia sets typically have a [[fractal]] structure, and the [[fractal dimension]] can be calculated for them.\n\n===Minimum complexity of a chaotic system===\n[[File:LogisticMap BifurcationDiagram.png|thumb|right|[[Bifurcation diagram]] of the [[logistic map]] <span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\">''x'' \u2192 ''r'' ''x'' (1 \u2013 ''x'').</span>  Each vertical slice shows the attractor for a specific value of ''r''.  The diagram displays [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period-doubling]] as ''r'' increases, eventually producing chaos.]]\n\nDiscrete chaotic systems, such as the logistic map, can exhibit strange attractors whatever their [[dimension]]ality. In contrast, for [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] dynamical systems, the [[Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem]] shows that a strange attractor can only arise in three or more dimensions.  [[Dimension (vector space)|Finite-dimensional]] [[linear system]]s are never chaotic; for a dynamical system to display chaotic behavior, it must be either [[nonlinearity|nonlinear]] or infinite-dimensional.\n\nThe [[Poincar\u00e9\u2013Bendixson theorem]] states that a two-dimensional differential equation has very regular behavior. The Lorenz attractor discussed below is generated by a system of three [[differential equation]]s such as:\n: <math> \\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}x}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\sigma y - \\sigma x, \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}y}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= \\rho x - x z - y, \\\\\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}z}{\\mathrm{d}t} &= x y - \\beta z.\n\\end{align} </math>\nwhere <math>x</math>, <math>y</math>, and <math>z</math> make up the [[State space representation|system state]], <math>t</math> is time, and <math>\\sigma</math>, <math>\\rho</math>, <math>\\beta</math> are the system [[parameter]]s. Five of the terms on the right hand side are linear, while two are quadratic; a total of seven terms. Another well-known chaotic attractor is generated by the [[R\u00f6ssler map|R\u00f6ssler equations]], which have only one nonlinear term out of seven.

As such, differential equations of the form\n:: <math>J\\left(\\overset{...}{x},\\ddot{x},\\dot {x},x\\right)=0</math>\nare sometimes called ''Jerk equations''. It has been shown that a jerk equation, which is equivalent to a system of three first order, ordinary, non-linear differential equations, is in a certain sense the minimal setting for solutions showing chaotic behaviour. This motivates mathematical interest in jerk systems. Systems involving a fourth or higher derivative are called accordingly hyperjerk systems.<ref>K. E. Chlouverakis and J. C. Sprott, Chaos Solitons & Fractals 28, 739\u2013746 (2005), Chaotic Hyperjerk Systems, http://sprott.physics.wisc.edu/pubs/paper297.htm</ref>\n\nA jerk system's behavior is described by a jerk equation, and for certain jerk equations, simple electronic circuits can model solutions. These circuits are known as jerk circuits.\n\nOne of the most interesting properties of jerk circuits is the possibility of chaotic behavior. In fact, certain well-known chaotic systems, such as the Lorenz attractor and the [[R\u00f6ssler map]], are conventionally described as a system of three first-order differential equations that can combine into a single (although rather complicated) jerk equation. Nonlinear jerk systems are in a sense minimally complex systems to show chaotic behaviour; there is no chaotic system involving only two first-order, ordinary differential equations (the system resulting in an equation of second order only).\n\nAn example of a jerk equation with nonlinearity in the magnitude of <math>x</math> is:\n:<math>\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^3 x}{\\mathrm{d} t^3}+A\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2 x}{\\mathrm{d} t^2}+\\frac{\\mathrm{d} x}{\\mathrm{d} t}-|x|+1=0.</math>\n\nHere, ''A'' is an adjustable parameter. This equation has a chaotic solution for ''A''=3/5 and can be implemented with the following jerk circuit; the required nonlinearity is brought about by the two diodes:\n\n[[File:JerkCircuit01.png|frameless|upright=1.4|center]]\n\nIn the above circuit, all resistors are of equal value, except <math>R_A=R/A=5R/3</math>, and all capacitors are of equal size.

The output of [[operational amplifier|op amp]] 0 will correspond to the x variable, the output of 1 corresponds to the first derivative of x and the output of 2 corresponds to the second derivative.\n\n==Spontaneous order==\nUnder the right conditions, chaos spontaneously evolves into a lockstep pattern.

His interest in chaos came about accidentally through his work on [[meteorology|weather prediction]] in 1961.<ref name=Lorenz1961>{{cite journal |author=Lorenz, Edward N. |title=Deterministic non-periodic flow |journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences |volume=20 |pages=130\u2013141 |year=1963 |doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1963)020<0130:DNF>2.0.CO;2 |issue=2 |bibcode=1963JAtS...20..130L}}</ref> Lorenz was using a simple digital computer, a [[Royal McBee]] [[LGP-30]], to run his weather simulation. He wanted to see a sequence of data again, and to save time he started the simulation in the middle of its course. He did this by entering a printout of the data that corresponded to conditions in the middle of the original simulation. To his surprise, the weather the machine began to predict was completely different from the previous calculation. Lorenz tracked this down to the computer printout. The computer worked with 6-digit precision, but the printout rounded variables off to a 3-digit number, so a value like 0.506127 printed as 0.506. This difference is tiny, and the consensus at the time would have been that it should have no practical effect. However, Lorenz discovered that small changes in initial conditions produced large changes in long-term outcome.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Chaos: Making a New Science]] |last=Gleick |first=James |year=1987 |publisher=Cardinal |location=London|page=17|isbn=978-0-434-29554-8}}</ref> Lorenz's discovery, which gave its name to [[Lorenz attractor]]s, showed that even detailed atmospheric modelling cannot, in general, make precise long-term weather predictions.\n\nIn 1963, [[Benoit Mandelbrot]] found recurring patterns at every scale in data on cotton prices.<ref>{{cite journal|first = Beno\u00eet|last = Mandelbrot|year = 1963|title = The variation of certain speculative prices|journal = Journal of Business|volume = 36|pages = 394\u2013419|doi = 10.1086/294632|issue = 4|jstor=2350970}}</ref> Beforehand he had studied [[information theory]] and concluded noise was patterned like a [[Cantor set]]: on any scale the proportion of noise-containing periods to error-free periods was a constant \u2013 thus errors were inevitable and must be planned for by incorporating redundancy.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Berger J.M. |author2=Mandelbrot B. | year = 1963 | title = A new model for error clustering in telephone circuits | journal = IBM Journal of Research and Development | volume = 7 |issue=3 | pages = 224\u2013236 | doi=10.1147/rd.73.0224}}</ref> Mandelbrot described both the \"Noah effect\" (in which sudden discontinuous changes can occur) and the \"Joseph effect\" (in which persistence of a value can occur for a while, yet suddenly change afterwards).<ref>{{cite book |author=Mandelbrot, B. |title=The Fractal Geometry of Nature |publisher=Freeman |location=New York |year=1977 |page=248 }}</ref><ref>See also: {{cite book |last1=Mandelbrot |first1=Beno\u00eet B. |last2=Hudson |first2=Richard L. |title=The (Mis)behavior of Markets: A Fractal View of Risk, Ruin, and Reward |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=2004 |page=201 }}</ref> This challenged the idea that changes in price were [[normal distribution|normally distributed]].

Although these approaches were not always welcomed (at least initially) by specialists in the subjects examined, SOC has nevertheless become established as a strong candidate for explaining a number of natural phenomena, including [[earthquake]]s, (which, long before SOC was discovered, were known as a source of scale-invariant behavior such as the [[Gutenberg\u2013Richter law]] describing the statistical distribution of earthquake sizes, and the [[Aftershock|Omori law]]<ref>{{cite journal |author=Omori, F. |title=On the aftershocks of earthquakes |journal=Journal of the College of Science, Imperial University of Tokyo |volume=7 |pages=111\u2013200 |year=1894 }}</ref> describing the frequency of aftershocks), [[solar flare]]s, fluctuations in economic systems such as [[financial market]]s (references to SOC are common in [[econophysics]]), [[landscape formation]], [[forest fire]]s, [[landslide]]s, [[epidemic]]s, and [[biological evolution]] (where SOC has been invoked, for example, as the dynamical mechanism behind the theory of \"[[punctuated equilibrium|punctuated equilibria]]\" put forward by [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]). Given the implications of a scale-free distribution of event sizes, some researchers have suggested that another phenomenon that should be considered an example of SOC is the occurrence of [[war]]s. These investigations of SOC have included both attempts at modelling (either developing new models or adapting existing ones to the specifics of a given natural system), and extensive data analysis to determine the existence and/or characteristics of natural scaling laws.\n\nIn the same year, [[James Gleick]] published ''[[Chaos: Making a New Science]]'', which became a best-seller and introduced the general principles of chaos theory as well as its history to the broad public, though his history under-emphasized important Soviet contributions.{{citation needed|reason=No reason given for soviet under-emphasis|date=May 2016}}<ref>{{cite book|last=Gleick|first=James|title=Chaos: Making a New Science|date=August 26, 2008|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0143113454}}</ref> Initially the domain of a few, isolated individuals, chaos theory progressively emerged as a transdisciplinary and institutional discipline, mainly under the name of [[nonlinear system]]s analysis.

Results were admittedly inconclusive.

The authors examined a well-known response called schedule-induced polydipsia, by which an animal deprived of food for certain lengths of time will drink unusual amounts of water when the food is at last presented.  The control parameter (r) operating here was the length of the interval between feedings, once resumed.  The authors were careful to test a large number of animals and to include many replications, and they designed their experiment so as to rule out the likelihood that changes in response patterns were caused by different starting places for r.\n\nTime series and first delay plots provide the best support for the claims made, showing a fairly clear march from periodicity to irregularity as the feeding times were increased.  The various phase trajectory plots and spectral analyses, on the other hand, do not match up well enough with the other graphs or with the overall theory to lead inexorably to a chaotic diagnosis.  For example, the phase trajectories do not show a definite progression towards greater and greater complexity (and away from periodicity); the process seems quite muddied.  Also, where Metcalf and Allen saw periods of two and six in their spectral plots, there is room for alternative interpretations.  All of this ambiguity necessitate some serpentine, post-hoc explanation to show that results fit a chaotic model.\n\nBy adapting a model of career counseling to include a chaotic interpretation of the relationship between employees and the job market, Aniundson and Bright found that better suggestions can be made to people struggling with career decisions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pryor|first=Robert G.

Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. {{ISBN|1-883729-06-8}}</ref> Radford revealed that Tolentino \"believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''Species'' were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time,\" and therefore concludes that \"the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted.\"<ref name=\"Radford2011\" /> This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.<ref>Radford, Benjamin. \"Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery\" ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45\u201348</ref>\n\nIn addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a [[necropsy]],<ref name=\"Radford2011\" /> the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood.

is the longest of central [[New York (state)|New York]]'s glacial [[Finger Lakes]], and is the second largest in surface area (marginally smaller than [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]]) and second largest in volume.  It is just under {{convert|40|mi}} long.  Its average width is 1.7 miles (2.7&nbsp;km), and it is {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=mid|wide|abbr=on}} at its widest point near Aurora.  It is approximately {{convert|435|ft|m|adj=mid|deep|abbr=on}} at its deepest point.\n\n==Location==\nThe city of [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], site of [[Ithaca College]] and [[Cornell University]], is located at the southern end of Cayuga Lake.\n\nVillages and settlements along the east shore of Cayuga Lake include Myers, King Ferry, [[Aurora, Cayuga County, New York|Aurora]], Levanna, [[Union Springs, New York|Union Springs]], and [[Cayuga, New York|Cayuga]].  Settlements along the west shore of the lake include Sheldrake, Poplar Beach, and Canoga.\n\nThe lake has two small islands. One is near Union Springs; Frontenac Island(North East).  This island is not inhabited. The other island, Canoga Island(North West) is located near the town of Canoga.  This island has several camps and is inhabited during the summer months. The only other island in any of the Finger Lakes is [[Squaw Island (Canandaigua Lake)|Squaw Island]] in [[Canandaigua Lake]].\n\n===Geographical characteristics===\nCayuga Lake is located at {{Coord|42|41|00|N|76|41|46|W|region:US_type:waterbody}}; {{convert|116.4|m}} above sea level. Its depth, steep east and west sides with shallow north and south ends is typical of the Finger Lakes, as they were carved by [[glacier]]s during the last [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]].\n\nThe water level is regulated by the Mud Lock at the north end of the lake. It is connected to [[Lake Ontario]] by the [[Erie Canal]] and [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake]] by the [[Seneca River (New York)|Seneca River]]. The lake is drawn down as winter approaches, to minimize ice damage and to maximize its capacity to store heavy spring runoff.\n\nThe north end is dominated by shallow [[mudflats]].  An important stopover for [[Bird migration|migratory]] birds, the mudflats and marsh are the location of the [[Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge]]. The southern end is also shallow and often freezes during the winter.\n\n===Human impact===\n[[Image:CayugaLake.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Winter view of the head of Cayuga Lake]]\n\nCayuga Lake is very popular among recreational boaters. The [[Allan H. Treman State Marine Park]], a large state marina and boat launch, is located at the southern end of the lake in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].  There are two yacht clubs on the western shore: [[Ithaca Yacht Club]] a few miles north of Ithaca, and Red Jacket Yacht Club just south of Canoga. There are several other marinas and boat launches scattered along the lake shore.\n\nCayuga Lake is the source of drinking water for several communities, including Lansing near the southern end of the lake along the east side, which draws water through the [[Bolton Point, New York|Bolton Point]] Municipal Water system. There are also several [[Deep lake water cooling|lake source cooling]] systems that are in operation on the lake, whereby cooler water is pumped from the depths of the lake, warmed, and circulated in a closed system back to the surface. One of these systems, which is operated by Cornell University and began operation in 2000, was controversial during the planning and building states for potential negative environmental impact.  All the environmental impact reports and scientific studies have shown that the Cornell lake source cooling system has not yet had and will not likely have any measurably significant environmental impact. Furthermore, Cornell's system pumps significantly less warm water back into the lake than others further north which have been operating for decades, including the coal-fired power plant on the eastern shore.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[Image:AES Cayuga.jpg|right|thumb|250px|AES Cayuga, on the eastern shore of the lake]]\nThe AES Cayuga electrical generating station operates in the Town of Lansing, on the east shore of Cayuga Lake. This coal-fired plant uses Cayuga Lake as a cooling source.  In the late 1960s, citizens successfully opposed the construction of an 830-MW nuclear power plant on the shore of Cayuga Lake.<ref>[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&_&ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ107899&ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&accno=EJ107899  \"The Role of Experts in a Nuclear Siting Controversy\"]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MD4cPQAmF7oC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=Cayuga+Lake+nuclear+power&source=web&ots=f9NO88vkjr&sig=DsaBb6otYOvd6rj5zl2N6ZEVhXg&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result#PPA262,M1 Chain Reaction] pp. 262-264.</ref><ref>Wolfgang Rudig (1990).

The university is governed by 24 Trustees, customarily including the President, who serves [[Ex officio member|ex officio]]. The Trustees themselves are responsible for choosing their successors. Six of the 24 are nominated from a pool of candidates recommended by the Columbia Alumni Association. Another six are nominated by the Board in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate. The remaining 12, including the President, are nominated by the Trustees themselves through their internal processes. The term of office for Trustees is six years. Generally, they serve for no more than two consecutive terms. The Trustees appoint the President and other senior administrative officers of the university, and review and confirm faculty appointments as required. They determine the university's financial and investment policies, authorize the budget, supervise the endowment, direct the management of the university's real estate and other assets, and otherwise oversee the administration and management of the university.<ref name=\"Columbia.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/content/board-trustees.html|title=Board of Trustees|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe University Senate was established by the Trustees after a university-wide referendum in 1969. It succeeded to the powers of the University Council, which was created in 1890 as a body of faculty, deans, and other administrators to regulate inter-Faculty affairs and consider issues of university-wide concern. The University Senate is a unicameral body consisting of 107 members drawn from all constituencies of the university. These include the president of the university, the Provost, the Deans of Columbia College and the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, all who serve ex officio, and five additional representatives, appointed by the President, from the university's administration. The President serves as the Senate's presiding officer. The Senate is charged with reviewing the educational policies, physical development, budget, and external relations of the university. It oversees the welfare and academic freedom of the faculty and the welfare of students.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/|title=Columbia University Senate|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"senate.columbia.edu\">{{cite web|url= |title=Election packet |date=2017 |website=senate.columbia.edu |format=PDF}}</ref><ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://senate.columbia.edu/topbar_pages/elections.html|title=Elections|website=senate.columbia.edu}}</ref>\n\n[[List of Presidents of Columbia University|The President of Columbia University]], who is selected by the Trustees in consultation with the Executive Committee of the University Senate and who serves at the Trustees' pleasure, is the chief executive officer of the university.

A second issue was the Columbia administration's failure to resign its institutional membership in [[the Pentagon]]'s weapons research think-tank, the [[Institute for Defense Analyses]] (IDA). Students barricaded themselves inside [[Low Memorial Library|Low Library]], [[Hamilton Hall (Columbia University)|Hamilton Hall]], and several other university buildings during the protests, and New York City police were called onto the campus to arrest or forcibly remove the students.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/nyregion/28columbia.html \"Columbia's Radicals of 1968 Hold a Bittersweet Reunion\"].

It celebrates the illumination of the medium-sized trees lining College Walk in front of Kent and Hamilton Halls on the east end and Dodge and Journalism Halls on the west, just before finals week in early December. The lights remain on until February 28. Students meet at the sun-dial for free hot chocolate, performances by ''a cappella'' groups, and speeches by the university president and a guest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|author=Jason Hollander|publisher=Columbia University News|accessdate=April 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\nImmediately following the College Walk festivities is one of Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]], but lapsed before being revived by University President [[Nicholas Murray Butler]] in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as [[Continental Army]] soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid the singing of seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony is accompanied by a reading of ''[[A Visit From St. Nicholas]]'' by [[Clement Clarke Moore]] and ''[[Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus]]'' by [[Francis Pharcellus Church]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hollander|first=Jason|date=December 3, 1999|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/99/12/treeLighting.html|title=Holiday Season Ushered In With Tree-Lighting Ceremony|work=Columbia News|accessdate=August 10, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===The Varsity Show===\n[[The Varsity Show]] is an annual musical written by and for students and was established in 1894, making it one of Columbia's oldest traditions.
