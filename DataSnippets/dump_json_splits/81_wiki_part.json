Its pilot, [[Sergei Safronov (fighter pilot)|Sergei Safronov]], ejected but died of his injuries. Another Soviet aircraft, a newly manufactured [[Su-9]] on a transit flight, also attempted to intercept Powers's U-2. The unarmed Su-9 was directed to ram the U-2, but missed because of the large differences in speed (the Su-9 flew above Mach 1.1, while the U-2 flew at approximately Mach 0.6).\n\nThe first of three SA-2 Guideline (S-75 Dvina) surface-to-air missiles launched at the U-2 near Kosulino in the Ural Region hit the aircraft. \"What was left of the plane began spinning, only upside down, the nose pointing upward toward the sky, the tail down toward the ground.\" Powers was unable to activate the plane's self-destruct mechanism before he was thrown out of the plane after releasing the canopy and his seat belt. While descending under his parachute, Powers had time to scatter his escape map, and rid himself of part of his suicide device, a silver dollar coin suspended around his neck containing a poison-laced injection pin, though he kept the poison pin.<ref>http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/gary-powers-secret-diary-soviet-capture-180956939/#yilEojcaVQvIj9qc.99</ref> \"Yet I was still hopeful of escape.\"  He hit the ground hard, was immediately captured, and taken to [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka Prison]] in [[Moscow]].<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|61\u201363,67\u201371,76}} Powers did note a second chute after landing on the ground, \"some distance away and very high, a lone red and white parachute\".<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|69,148\u2013149,274,278}}<ref name=Rich>{{Cite book |last=Rich |first=Ben |title=Skunk Works |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |year=1994 |ISBN=0316743305 |pages=162\u2013163}}</ref>{{rp|159\u2013160}}\n\n===Cover story===\nWhen the U.S. government learned of Powers's disappearance over the Soviet Union, they issued a cover statement claiming a \"weather plane\" had strayed off course after its pilot had \"difficulties with his oxygen equipment\". What CIA officials did not realize was that the plane crashed almost fully intact, and the Soviets recovered its equipment.

Your press will give it to us.\"  However, he limited his divulging of CIA contacts to one individual, with a [[pseudonym]] of \"Collins\".

Powers's interrogations ended on June 30, and his solitary confinement ended on July 9. On August 17, 1960, his trial began for espionage before the military division of the Supreme Court of the USSR. Lieutenant General Borisoglebsky, Major General Vorobyev, and Major General Zakharov presided. Roman Rudenko acted as prosecutor in his capacity of [[Procurator General of the Soviet Union]].  [[Mikhail I. Grinev]] served as Powers's defense counsel. In attendance were his parents and sister, and his wife Barbara and her mother. His father brought along his attorney Carl McAfee, while the CIA provided two additional attorneys.<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|110,114,119,120,142\u2013143,148,157\u2013158,162,188,220}}\n\n===Conviction===\nOn August 19, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage, \"a grave crime covered by Article 2 of the Soviet Union's law 'On Criminality Responsibility for State Crimes'\".  His sentence consisted of 10 years' confinement, three of which were to be in a prison, with the remainder in a [[labor camp]]. The US Embassy \"News Bulletin\" stated, according to Powers, \"as far as the government was concerned, I had acted in accordance with the instructions given me and would receive my full salary while imprisoned\".<ref name=Powers/>{{rp|157\u2013161}}\n\nHe was held in [[Vladimir Central Prison]], about {{convert|150|mi|km}} east of Moscow, in building number 2 from September 9, 1960 until February 8, 1962. His cellmate was Zigurd Kruminsh (Zigurds Kr\u016bmi\u0146\u0161), a Latvian political prisoner. Powers kept a diary and a journal while confined. Additionally he took up carpet weaving from his cellmate to pass the time. He could send and receive a limited number of letters from his family. The prison now contains a small museum with an exhibit on Powers, who allegedly developed a good rapport with Russian prisoners there. Some pieces of the plane and Powers's uniform are on display at the [[Central Air Force Museum|Monino Airbase museum]] near [[Moscow]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moninoaviation.com/33a.html|title=Air Force Museum - Monino, Russia|website=www.moninoaviation.com|access-date=2018-03-29}}</ref>\n\n===Prisoner exchange===\nOn February 10, 1962, Powers was exchanged, along with U.S. student [[Frederic Pryor]], in a well-publicized spy swap at the [[Glienicke Bridge]] in [[Berlin]]. The exchange was for Soviet KGB [[Colonel]] [[Rudolf Abel|Vilyam Fisher]], known as \"Rudolf Abel\", who had been caught by the [[FBI]] and tried and jailed for espionage.<ref>[https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/hollow-nickel/rudolph-ivanovich-abel-hollow-nickel-case/ Famous Cases: Rudolph Ivanovich Abel (Hollow Nickel Case)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121132429/https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/history/famous-cases/hollow-nickel/rudolph-ivanovich-abel-hollow-nickel-case/ |date=January 21, 2016 }}.

For example, the work suggests there were consecrated temple virgins in Judaism, similar to the [[Vestal Virgin]]s in pagan Rome, but that is never directly stated to have been a practice in mainstream Judaism. Conversely, some [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] and Roman Catholics argue that the Old Testament shows that the idea of Mary being a consecrated virgin is plausible and claim the practice of consecrated virginity was within Judaism since the days of the prophet Samuel ({{bibleref2|1 Samuel|2:22}}),<ref>\"Mary would thus serve the Lord at the Temple, as women had for centuries (1 Sam. 2:22)\" [http://www.catholic.com/tracts/mary-ever-virgin \"Mary: Ever Virgin\"], at catholic.com</ref> and until the time of the [[Maccabees]] ({{bibleref2|2 Macc|3:19-20}}). A similar claim is also made by a number of Rabbinic sources.<ref>[http://taylormarshall.com/2011/12/did-jewish-temple-virgins-exist-and-was.html Dr. Taylor Marshall, \"Did Jewish Temple Virgins exist?\", December 2011]</ref>\n\nThe consensus is that it was actually composed in the latter half of the 2nd century. The first mention of it is by [[Origen of Alexandria]] in the early 3rd century, who says the text, like that of a [[Gospel of Peter]], was of dubious, recent appearance and shared with that book the claim that the \"brethren of the Lord\" were sons of Joseph by a former wife.<ref name=\"Origen\">{{cite book |author=[[Origen of Alexandria]] |title=Origen's Commentary on Matthew 10.17 in [[Ante-Nicene Fathers]] Volume IX |accessdate=2008-09-18 |chapter=The Brethren of Jesus |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf09.xvi.ii.iii.xvii.html |quote=But some say, basing it on a tradition in the Gospel according to Peter, as it is entitled, or \"The Book of James,\" that the brethren of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he married before Mary. Now those who say so wish to preserve the honour of Mary in virginity to the end, so that that body of hers which was appointed to minister to the Word which said, \"The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee,\" might not know intercourse with a man after that the Holy Ghost came into her and the power from on high overshadowed her.}}</ref>\n\nAlthough a number of Church councils condemned it as an inauthentic writing of the New Testament, this did little to diminish its popularity. [[Pope Innocent I]] condemned this Gospel of James in his third epistle ''ad Exuperium'' in 405 AD, and the so-called [[Gelasian Decree]] also excluded it as canonical around 500 AD.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Betsworth|first1=Sharon|title=Children in early christian literature : children as characters, metaphors, and types in early...|date=2014|publisher=T & T Clark|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0567235466|page=169}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cumming|first1=John|title=Books on Google Play  A Preservative Against Popery, in Several Select Discourses|date=1849|location=United Kingdom|isbn=978-0243973637|page=320|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P0MAAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA320&lpg=PA320&dq=pope+innocent+ad+exuperium+gospel+of+james&source=bl&ots=UnNFpA0_Pa&sig=iw5Rr6_OEIPQuDJ7rWt4CdnMSfs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjqkfuznu_SAhXs5YMKHZOLC14Q6AEIIDAB#v=onepage&q=pope%20innocent%20ad%20exuperium%20gospel%20of%20james&f=false|accessdate=24 March 2017}}</ref> [[Thomas Aquinas]], in  his ''Summa Theologiae'' rejects the Protevangelium of James teaching that midwives were present at Christ's birth, and invokes Jerome as contending that the words of the canonical gospels show that Mary was both mother and midwife, that she wrapped up the child with swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger.

In Greek such an infancy gospel was termed a ''protevangelion'', a \"pre-Gospel\" narrating events of Jesus' life before those recorded in the four canonical gospels. Such a work was intended to be \"apologetic, doctrinal, or simply to satisfy one's curiosity\".<ref>[https://osjusa.org/st-joseph/apocrypha/ Toschi, O.S.J., Larry M. Toschi.\"St. Joseph in Apocrypha\", Oblates of St. Joseph]</ref> The literary genre that these works represent shows stylistic features that suggest dates in the 2nd century and later. Other [[infancy gospel]]s in this tradition include [[The Infancy Gospel of Thomas]], the [[Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew]] (based on the Protevangelium of James and on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas), and the so-called [[Arabic Infancy Gospel]]; all of which were regarded by the [[Catholic Church|Church]] as [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]].\n\n==Manuscript tradition==\nSome indication of the popularity of the ''Infancy Gospel of James'' may be drawn from the fact that over 150 Greek manuscripts containing it have survived. The ''Gospel of James'' was translated into Syriac, Ethiopic, Coptic, Georgian, Old Slavonic, Armenian, Arabic, Irish and  Latin. Though no early Latin versions are known, it was relegated to the apocrypha in the [[Decretum Gelasianum|Gelasian decretal]], so it must have been known in the West by the fifth century though the vast majority of the manuscripts come from the 10th century or later. The earliest known manuscript of the text, a papyrus dating to the third or early 4th century, was found in 1958; it is kept in the [[Bibliotheca Bodmeriana|Bodmer Library]], [[Geneva]] (Papyrus Bodmer 5). Of the  surviving Greek manuscripts, the fullest text is a 10th-century codex in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale]], Paris (Paris 1454).\n\n==Content==\n[[Image:GaudFerrariAnnuncJoachAnna.jpg|thumb|''Annunciation to Joachim and Anna'', fresco detail by [[Gaudenzio Ferrari]], 1544&ndash;45: Extra-canonical legends surrounding Mary's birth became an integral element of Christian lore, in both East and West.]]\n[[File:Byzantine ivory 802.jpg|thumb|[[Ivory]] panel with the [[Adoration of the Magi]] (6th century AD). At bottom centre, a kneeling woman \u2014 [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]] \u2014 holds out her withered hand towards the infant Christ; this story only features in the Gospel of James.]]\nThe Gospel of James is in three equal parts, of eight chapters each:\n*The first contains the story of the unique birth of [[Mary mother of Jesus|Mary]] to [[Saint Anne|Anna]] and her childhood and dedication to the temple.\n*The second starts when she is 12 years old, and through the direction of an angel, [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] is selected to become her husband.\n*The third relates the [[Nativity of Jesus]], with the visit of midwives, hiding of Jesus from [[Herod the Great]] in a feeding trough and the parallel hiding in the hills of John the Baptist and his mother ([[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]]) from [[Herod Antipas]].\n\nOne of the work's high points is the Lament of [[Saint Anne|Anna]]. A primary theme is the work and grace of [[God]] in Mary's life, Mary's personal purity, and her perpetual virginity before, during and after the birth of Jesus, as confirmed by the midwife after she gave birth, and tested by [[Salome (Gospel of James)|Salome]] who is perhaps intended to be [[Salome (disciple)|Salome, later the disciple of Jesus]] who is mentioned in the [[Gospel of Mark]] as being one of the [[women at the crucifixion]].\n\nThis is also the earliest text that explicitly claims that Joseph was a widower, with children, at the time that Mary is entrusted to his care. This feature is mentioned in the text of [[Origen]], who adduces it to demonstrate that the 'brethren of the Lord' were sons of Joseph by a former wife.<ref name=\"Origen\" />\n\nAmong further traditions not present in the four canonical gospels are the birth of Jesus in a cave, the martyrdom of [[John the Baptist]]'s father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] during the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] and Joseph's being elderly when Jesus was born. The Nativity reported as taking place in a cave remained in the popular imagination; many Early Renaissance Sienese and Florentine paintings of the Nativity continued to show such a setting, which is practically universal in Byzantine, Greek and Russian icons of the Nativity. The Gospel also describes the narrative of Mary\u2019s early childhood in the holiest part of the temple, which was later also [[Mary in Islam#In the Qur\u2019an|mentioned in the Qur\u2019an]].<ref>{{cite news|title=The smashers of Mary\u2019s images are acting more against statues than against her|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2017/11/mary-idolatry-and-donald-trump|accessdate=2 December 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=30 Nov 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Castelseprio]] - ''early fresco depiction of the \"Trial by water\"\n*''[[History of Joseph the Carpenter]]''\n*[[New Testament apocrypha]]\n*[[Pseudepigraphy]]\n*[[Textual criticism]]\n\n===Related===\n*[[Acts of the Apostles (genre)]]\n*[[Apocalyptic literature]]\n*[[Epistles]]\n*[[List of Gospels]]\n*[[List of New Testament papyri]]\n*[[Salome (Gospel of James)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikisource|Protevangelion of James}}\n*[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/infancyjames.html Early Christian Writings website:] ''Infancy Gospel of James''\n*[http://www.osjoseph.org/stjoseph/apocrypha/ St. Joseph in Apocrypha], from \"Oblates of St. Joseph\".<!--retrieved 14 June 2004-->\n*[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0847.htm The Protoevangelium of James]\n\n{{The Lost Books of the Bible and the Forgotten Books of Eden}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gospel Of James}}\n[[Category:Apocryphal Gospels]]\n[[Category:2nd-century Christian texts]]\n[[Category:Infancy Gospels|James]]\n[[Category:Pseudepigraphy]]", "sha1": "97ixinxtwuhepikw4lpn7ot46zwn599"}}, {"title": "Gene therapy", "ns": "0", "id": "12891", "revision": {"id": "866604985", "parentid": "863853085", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T11:25:42Z", "contributor": {"username": "JFG", "id": "168812"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Add Longevity navbox (via [[WP:JWB]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2016}}\n[[File:Gene therapy.jpg|thumb|300px|Gene therapy using an [[adenovirus]] vector.

Any such modifications affect the individual patient only, and are not inherited by [[offspring]]. Somatic gene therapy represents mainstream basic and clinical research, in which therapeutic DNA (either integrated in the [[genome]] or as an external [[episome]] or [[plasmid]]) is used to treat disease.\n\nOver 600 [[clinical trials]] utilizing SCGT are underway{{when|date=July 2018}} in the US. Most focus on severe genetic disorders, including [[Primary immunodeficiency|immunodeficiencies]], [[haemophilia]], [[Thalassemia|thalassaemia]], and [[cystic fibrosis]]. Such single gene disorders are good candidates for somatic cell therapy. The complete correction of a genetic disorder or the replacement of multiple genes is not yet possible.

The two major classes are [[recombinant virus]]es (sometimes called biological nanoparticles or viral vectors) and [[naked DNA]] or DNA complexes (non-viral methods).\n\n===Viruses===\n{{Main|Viral vector}}\nIn order to [[Viral replication|replicate]], [[virus]]es introduce their genetic material into the host cell, tricking the host's cellular machinery into using it as blueprints for viral proteins. [[Retrovirus]]es go a stage further by having their genetic material copied into the genome of the host cell.  Scientists exploit this by substituting a virus's genetic material with therapeutic DNA. (The term 'DNA' may be an oversimplification, as some viruses contain RNA, and gene therapy could take this form as well.) A number of viruses have been used for human gene therapy, including [[retrovirus]]es, [[adenovirus]]es, [[herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex]], [[vaccinia virus|vaccinia]], and [[adeno-associated virus]].<ref name=\"JGenMed Database\" /> Like the genetic material (DNA or RNA) in viruses, therapeutic DNA can be designed to simply serve as a temporary blueprint that is degraded naturally or (at least theoretically) to enter the host's genome, becoming a permanent part of the host's DNA in infected cells.\n\n=== Non-viral ===\nNon-viral methods present certain advantages over viral methods, such as large scale production and low host [[immunogenicity]]. However, non-viral methods initially produced lower levels of [[transfection]] and [[gene expression]], and thus lower therapeutic efficacy. Later technology remedied this deficiency.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n[[Vectors in Gene Therapy#Non-viral methods|Methods for non-viral gene therapy]] include the injection of naked DNA, [[electroporation]], the [[gene gun]], [[sonoporation]], [[magnetofection]], the use of [[oligonucleotide]]s, lipoplexes, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles.\n\n==Hurdles==\nSome of the unsolved problems include:\n*Short-lived nature \u2013 Before gene therapy can become a permanent cure for a condition, the therapeutic DNA introduced into target cells must remain functional and the cells containing the therapeutic DNA must be stable. Problems with integrating therapeutic DNA into the [[genome]] and the rapidly dividing nature of many cells prevent it from achieving long-term benefits. Patients require multiple treatments.\n*Immune response \u2013 Any time a foreign object is introduced into human tissues, the immune system is stimulated to attack the invader. Stimulating the immune system in a way that reduces gene therapy effectiveness is possible. The [[immune system]]'s enhanced response to viruses that it has seen before reduces the effectiveness to repeated treatments.\n*Problems with viral vectors \u2013 Viral vectors carry the risks of toxicity, inflammatory responses, and gene control and targeting issues. \n*Multigene disorders \u2013 Some commonly occurring disorders, such as [[heart disease]], [[high blood pressure]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], and [[diabetes]], are affected by variations in multiple genes, which complicate gene therapy.\n*Some therapies may breach the [[Weismann barrier]] (between soma and germ-line) protecting the testes, potentially modifying the germline, falling afoul of regulations in countries that prohibit the latter practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wasdarwinwrong.com/kortho39a.htm |title=The implications of Steele's soma-to-germline feedback for human gene therapy | vauthors = Korthof G }}</ref> \n*Insertional [[mutagenesis]] \u2013 If the DNA is integrated in a sensitive spot in the genome, for example in a [[tumor suppressor gene]], the therapy could induce a [[tumor]].

Light grey areas indicate languages that do not inflect nouns for grammatical case.]]\n\n'''Case''' is a special [[grammatical category]] of a [[noun]], [[pronoun]], [[adjective]], [[participle]] or [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]] whose value reflects the [[grammatical function]] performed by that word in a [[phrase]], [[clause]] or [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. In some languages, nouns, pronouns, adjectives, [[determiners]], participles, prepositions, numerals, articles and their [[modifier (grammar)|modifiers]] take different [[inflection|inflected]] forms, depending on their case. As a language evolves, cases can merge (for instance, in [[Ancient Greek]], the [[locative case]] merged with the [[dative case]]), a phenomenon formally called [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].{{sfn |Clackson|2007|page=91}}\n\n[[English language|English]] has largely lost its case system although personal pronouns still have three cases, which are simplified forms of the [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[genitive case]]s. They are used with [[personal pronoun]]s: [[subjective case]] (I, you, he, she, it, we, they, who, whoever), [[objective case]] (me, you, him, her, it, us, them, whom, whomever) and [[possessive case]] (my, mine; your, yours; his; her, hers; its; our, ours; their, theirs; whose; whosever<ref>The Chambers Dictionary, 11th edition</ref>). Forms such as ''I'', ''he'' and ''we'' are used for the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (\"'''I''' kicked the ball\"), and forms such as ''me'', ''him'' and ''us'' are used for the [[object (grammar)|object]] (\"John kicked '''me'''\").\n\nLanguages such as [[Sanskrit]], Ancient Greek, [[Latin]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Hindi]], [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Czech Language|Czech]], [[Slovak Language|Slovak]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Estonian language|Estonian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Basque language|Basque]] and most [[Caucasian languages]] have extensive case systems, with nouns, pronouns, [[adjective]]s, and [[determiner]]s all inflecting (usually by means of different [[suffix]]es) to indicate their case. The number of cases differs between languages: [[Esperanto]] has two; German, Icelandic and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] have four; Turkish, Latin and Russian each have at least six; Armenian, Czech, Polish, Serbo-Croatian, Ukrainian and Lithuanian all have seven; Sanskrit has eight; Estonian has fourteen and Finnish has fifteen, Hungarian has eighteen and [[Tsez language|Tsez]] has sixty-four. \n\nCommonly encountered cases include [[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]] and [[genitive]]. A role that one of those languages marks by case is often marked in English with a [[preposition]]. For example, the English prepositional phrase ''with (his) foot'' (as in \"John kicked the ball with his foot\") might be rendered in Russian using a single noun in the [[instrumental case]] or in Ancient Greek as {{lang|grc|\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03af}} ({{grc-tr|\u03c4\u1ff7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03af}}, meaning \"the foot\") with both words (the definite article, and the noun {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}} ({{grc-tr|\u03c0\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}}) \"foot\") changing to dative form.\n\nMore formally, case has been defined as \"a system of marking dependent nouns for the type of relationship they bear to their [[Head (linguistics)|heads]]\".<ref name=Blake>Blake, Barry J. ''Case''. Cambridge University Press: 2001.</ref>{{rp|p.1}} Cases should be distinguished from [[thematic relation|thematic roles]] such as ''[[agent (grammar)|agent]]'' and ''[[patient (grammar)|patient]]''. They are often closely related, and in languages such as Latin, several thematic roles have an associated case, but cases are a [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] notion, and thematic roles a [[semantics|semantic]] one. Languages having cases often exhibit [[free word order]], as thematic roles are not required to be marked by position in the sentence.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe English word ''case'' used in this sense comes from the Latin {{lang|la|casus}}, which is derived from the verb {{wikt-lang|la|cado|cadere}}, \"to fall\", from the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/\u1e31ad-|{{PIE|*\u1e31ad-}}]]''.<ref>{{OEtymD|case}}</ref> The Latin word is a [[calque]] of the Greek {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, {{grc-tr|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}, lit. \"falling, fall\".<ref>\"L. {{wikt-lang|la|c\u0101sus}} used to translate Gr. {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} lit. 'falling, fall'. By [[Aristotle]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} was applied to any derived, inflected, or extended form of the simple {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1f44\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1}} or {{wikt-lang|grc|\u1fe5\u1fc6\u03bc\u03b1}} (i.e. the nominative of nouns, the present indicative of verbs), such as the oblique cases of nouns, the variations of adjectives due to gender and comparison, also the derived adverb (e.g. {{lang|grc|\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03af\u03c9\u03c2}} was a {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} of {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03b4\u03af\u03ba\u03b1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2}}), the other tenses and moods of the verb, including its interrogative form. The grammarians, following the [[Stoics]], restricted {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03c4\u1ff6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}} to nouns, and included the nominative under the designation\". {{OED|case}}</ref> The sense is that all other cases are considered to have \"fallen\" away from the nominative. This picture is also reflected in the word ''[[declension]]'', from Latin {{wikt-lang|la|declino|declinere}}, \"to lean\", from the PIE root ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/\u1e31ley-|{{PIE|*\u1e31ley-}}]]''.\n\nThe equivalent to \"case\" in several other European languages also derives from ''casus'', including {{wikt-lang|fr|cas}} in French, {{wikt-lang|es|caso}} in Spanish and {{wikt-lang|de|Kasus}} in German. The Russian word {{lang|ru|\u043f\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0301\u0436}} (''pady\u00e9zh'') is a [[calque]] from Greek and similarly contains a root meaning \"fall\", and the German {{wikt-lang|de|Fall}} and Czech {{wikt-lang|cs|p\u00e1d}} simply mean \"fall\", and are used for both the concept of grammatical case and to refer to physical falls. The Finnish equivalent is {{wikt-lang|fi|sija}}, whose main meaning is \"position\" or \"place\".\n\n== Indo-European languages ==\n[[File:E7127-Balakhna-500-Years.jpg|thumb|On this sign in Russian memorializing an anniversary of the city of [[Balakhna]], the word ''Balakhna (''{{Lang-ru|\u0411\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445\u043d'''\u0430'''}}'')'' on the right is in the nominative case, whereas the word ''Balakhne (''{{Lang-ru|\u0411\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0445\u043d'''\u0435'''}}'')'' is in the dative case in ''Balakhne 500 Let'' ('Balakhna is 500 years old', or more literally 'To Balakhna 500 (of) years') on the front of the sign. Furthermore, ''let'' is in the genitive (plural) case.]]\n\nAlthough not very prominent in modern English, cases featured much more saliently in [[Old English language|Old English]] and other ancient [[Indo-European languages]], such as [[Latin]], [[Old Persian]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]. Historically, the Indo-European languages had eight morphological cases, though modern languages typically have fewer, using prepositions and word order to convey information that had previously been conveyed using distinct noun forms. Among modern languages, cases still feature prominently in most of the [[Balto-Slavic languages]] (except Macedonian and Bulgarian<ref>[https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/slavic_languages.jsp Slavic Languages] on quickia.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121155741/http://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/slavic_languages.jsp |date=2009-11-21 }}</ref>), with most having six to eight cases, as well as [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[German language|German]] and [[Modern Greek]], which have four. In German, cases are mostly marked on articles and adjectives, and less so on nouns. In Icelandic, articles, adjectives, personal names and nouns are all marked for case, making it, among other things, the living [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] that could be said to most closely resemble [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]].\n\nThe eight historical Indo-European cases are as follows, with examples either of the English case or of the English syntactic alternative to case:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Case\n!Indicates\n!Sample case words\n!Sample sentence\n!Interrogative\n!Notes\n|- \n|[[Nominative case|Nominative]] \n|[[Subject (grammar)|Subject]] of a [[finite verb]]\n|we\n|'''''We''' went to the store.''\n|Who or what?\n|Corresponds to English's [[subject pronoun]]s.\n|-\n|[[Accusative case|Accusative]]\n|[[Direct object]] of a [[transitive verb]]\n|us,<br>for us,<br>the (object)\n|''The clerk remembered '''us'''.''<br>''John waited '''for us''' at the bus stop.''<br>''Obey '''the law'''.''\n|Whom or what?\n|Corresponds to English's [[object pronoun]]s and preposition ''for'' construction before the object, often marked by a definite article ''the''.

Case is based fundamentally on changes to the noun to indicate the noun's role in the sentence \u2013 one of the defining features of so-called [[fusional languages]]. [[Old English]] was a fusional language, but Modern English does not work this way.\n\n===Modern English===\nModern [[English language|English]] has largely abandoned the inflectional case system of [[Proto-Indo-European]] in favor of [[analytic language|analytic]] constructions. The [[personal pronoun]]s of Modern English retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class (a remnant of the more extensive [[Old English declension|case system of Old English]]). For other pronouns, and all nouns, adjectives, and articles, grammatical function is indicated only by [[word order]], by [[preposition]]s, and by the \"[[Saxon genitive]]\" (''-'s'').{{efn|The [[English possessive#Status of the possessive as a grammatical case|status of the possessive]] as an affix or a clitic is the subject of debate.<ref name=\"Hudson 2013\">{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=B\u00f6rjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David |editor1-link= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= A cognitive analysis of John's hat |last1=Hudson|first1= Richard |author-link1=Richard Hudson (linguist) |pages=123\u2013148}}</ref><ref name=\" B\u00f6rjars 2013\">{{Cite book |isbn=9789027273000|date=2013|publisher= John Benjamins Publishing Company |title= Morphosyntactic Categories and the Expression of Possession |editor1-last=B\u00f6rjars |editor1-first=Kersti |editor2-last=Denison |editor2-first=David | author-link1= David Denison |editor3-last=Scott |editor3-first=Alan |chapter= Expression of Possession in English |last1 =B\u00f6rjars | first1=Kersti |last2 =Denison | first2=David |editor1-link= David Denison |last3 =Krajewski | first3=Grzegorz |last4 =Scott | first4=Alan |pages=149\u2013176}}</ref> It differs from the noun inflection of languages such as German, in that the genitive ending may attach to the last word of the phrase.

This is not always considered to be a case; see {{slink|English possessive|Status of the possessive as a grammatical case}}.\n\nMost English personal pronouns have five forms: the nominative and oblique case forms, the possessive case, which has both a ''[[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]'' form (such as ''my'', ''our'') and a distinct ''independent'' form (such as ''mine'', ''ours'') (with two exceptions: the third person singular masculine and the third person singular neuter ''it'', which use the same form for both determiner and independent [''his car'', ''it is his'']), and a distinct ''[[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]]'' or ''intensive'' form (such as ''myself'', ''ourselves''). The interrogative personal pronoun ''who'' exhibits the greatest diversity of forms within the modern English pronoun system, having definite nominative, oblique, and genitive forms (''who'', ''whom'', ''whose'') and equivalently coordinating indefinite forms (''whoever'', ''whomever'', and ''whosever'').\n\nThough English ''pronouns'' can have subject and object forms (he/him, she/her), ''nouns'' show only a singular/plural and a possessive/non-possessive distinction (e.g. ''chair'', ''chairs'', ''chair's'', ''chairs'''). Note that ''chair'' does not change form between \"the chair is here\" (subject) and \"I saw the chair\" (direct object), a distinction made by word order and context.\n\n== Hierarchy of cases ==\n{{main article|Case hierarchy}}\nCases can be ranked in the following hierarchy, where a language that does not have a given case will tend not to have any cases to the right of the missing case:<ref name=Blake />{{rp|p.89}}\n\n: [[Nominative case|nominative]] \u2192 [[Accusative case|accusative]] ''or'' [[Ergative case|ergative]] \u2192 [[Genitive case|genitive]] \u2192 [[Dative case|dative]] \u2192 [[Locative case|locative]] ''or'' [[Prepositional case|prepositional]] \u2192 [[Ablative case|ablative]] ''and/or'' [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] \u2192 ''others''.\n\nThis is, however, only a general tendency. Many forms of [[Central German]], such as [[Colognian language|Colognian]] and [[Luxembourgish]], have a dative case but lack a genitive. In [[Irish language|Irish]] nouns, the nominative and accusative have fallen together, whereas the dative\u2013locative has remained separate in some paradigms; Irish also has genitive and vocative cases. In [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], the accusative, genitive, and dative have merged to an oblique case, but the language still retains vocative, locative, and ablative cases. Old English had an instrumental case, but not a locative or prepositional.\n\n== Case order ==\nThe traditional case order (nom-gen-dat-acc) was expressed for the first time in ''[[The Art of Grammar]]'' in the 2nd century AD:\n{{Verse translation|[[s:el:\u03a4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 \u0393\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae|\u03a0\u03c4\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u1f40\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u00b7 \u1f40\u03c1\u03b8\u03ae, \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, \u03b4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, \u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, \u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae.]]|There are five Cases, the right [nominative], the generic [genitive], the dative, the accusative, and the vocative.<ref>{{cite book|title=The grammar of Dionysios Thrax|translator=Tomas Davidson|location=St. Loius|publisher=Studley|year=1874|page=10|\nurl=https://archive.org/stream/grammarofdionysi00dionuoft#page/10/mode/1up}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Latin]] grammars, such as ''[[Ars grammatica]]'', followed the Greek tradition, but added the [[ablative case]] of Latin. Later other European languages also followed that Graeco-Roman tradition.\n\nHowever, for some languages, such as Russian or Latin, due to case [[Syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]] the order may be changed for convenience, where the accusative or the vocative cases are placed after the nominative and before the genitive.

This system appears in many [[Papuan languages]] as well as in [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], and other languages. In [[Basque language|Basque]] and various [[Amazonian languages|Amazonian]] and [[Australian languages]], only the phrase-final word (not necessarily the noun) is marked for case. In many [[Indo-European language|Indo-European]], [[Finnic languages|Finnic]], and [[Semitic languages]], case is marked on the noun, the determiner, and usually the adjective. Other systems are less common. In some languages, there is [[Suffixaufnahme|double-marking]] of a word as both genitive (to indicate semantic role) and another case such as accusative (to establish concord with the head noun).{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n== Declension paradigms ==\n{{Main|Declension}}\n\nDeclension is the process or result of altering nouns to the correct grammatical cases. Languages with rich nominal inflection (use grammatical cases for many purposes) typically have a number of identifiable declension classes, or groups of nouns with a similar pattern of case inflection or declension. Sanskrit has six declension classes, whereas Latin is traditionally considered to have [[Latin declension|five]], and Ancient Greek [[Greek declension|three declension classes]].<ref name=\"Beetham\">Frank Beetham, ''Learning Greek with Plato'', Bristol Phoenix Press, 2007.</ref> For example, Slovak has [[Slovak declension|fifteen noun declension classes]], five for each gender (the number may vary depending on which paradigms are counted or omitted, this mainly concerns those that modify declension of foreign words; refer to article).\n\nIn Indo-European languages, declension patterns may depend on a variety of factors, such as [[grammatical gender|gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], phonological environment, and irregular historical factors. Pronouns sometimes have separate paradigms. In some languages, particularly [[Slavic languages]], a case may contain different groups of endings depending on whether the word is a [[noun]] or an [[adjective]]. A single case may contain many different endings, some of which may even be derived from different roots. For example, in Polish, the genitive case has ''-a, -u, -\u00f3w, -i/-y, -e-'' for nouns, and ''-ego, -ej, -ich/-ych'' for adjectives. To a lesser extent, a noun's [[Masculine personal|animacy or humanness]] may add another layer of complexity. For example, in Russian:\n\n* {{lang|ru|\u041a\u043e\u0442}} (NOM, animate, zero ending) {{lang|ru|\u043b\u043e\u0301\u0432\u0438\u0442 \u043c\u044b\u0448\u0435\u0301\u0439.}} ((The) cat catches mice)\n* {{lang|ru|\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0431}} (NOM, inanimate, zero ending) {{lang|ru|\u0434\u0435\u0301\u0440\u0436\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u0440\u044b\u0301\u0448\u0443.}} ((The) pillar holds a/the roof)\nvs.\n* {{lang|ru|\u041f\u0451\u0442\u0440 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0301}} (ACC, animate, -a ending).

Below is an example of the declension of {{wikt-lang|el|\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2}} (sky), which has a different form in the singular of all four cases, together with the appropriate article in both the singular and the plural:\n\n* Nominative \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03bf \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 / \u03bf\u03b9 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af}}\n* Genitive \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd / \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bd}}\n* Accusative \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc / \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2}}\n* Vocative \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03ad / \u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af}}\n\n[[Ancient Greek]] had one additional case, the dative. At some point, it was replaced with the preposition {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}}, followed by the accusative. This became necessary when pronunciation simplified, merging the two long vowels eta and omega to short. The result was that dative did not sound much different from the accusative in the singular of the first two groups. However, the dative case is still used in many expressions.\n\nWith time, only the sigma of {{lang|el|\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}} was left and got attached to the article, except when an article is not used and it becomes {{lang|el|\u03c3\u03b5}} instead. Note that this is not a different case from the accusative.\n\nBelow is an example with the dative case of the word {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7}} (city):\n\n* Nominative \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03b7 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 / \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}}\n* Genitive \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 / \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03c9\u03bd}}\n* Dative \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03b7 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 / \u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9}}\n* Accusative \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 / \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}}\n* Vocative \u2013 {{lang|el|\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b7 / \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2}}\n\n=== Japanese ===\nCases in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are marked by [[Japanese particles|particles]] placed after the nouns.<ref name=\"tarou takahashi\">{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Tarou|title=A Japanese Grammar|year=2010|publisher=Hitsuji Shobou|location=Japan|isbn=978-4-89476-244-2|page=27|display-authors=etal|language=Japanese|edition=4}}</ref> A distinctive feature of Japanese is the presence of two cases, which are roughly equivalent to the nominative case in other languages: one representing the [[Topic and comment|sentence topic]], the other representing the subject. The most important case markers are the following:\n\n* Nominative - {{lang|ja|\u304c}} (ga) for subject, {{lang|ja|\u306f}} (wa) for the [[Topic marker#Japanese: \u306f|topic]]\n* Genitive - {{lang|ja|\u306e}} (no)\n* Dative - {{lang|ja|\u306b}} (ni)\n* Accusative - {{lang|ja|\u3092}} (wo)\n* Lative - {{lang|ja|\u3078}} (e), used for destination direction (like in \"to some place\")\n* Ablative - {{lang|ja|\u304b\u3089}} (kara), used for source direction (like in \"from some place\")\n* Instrumental - {{lang|ja|\u3067}} (de)\n\n=== Korean ===\nCases in [[Korean language|Korean]] are marked by [[Korean postpositions|particles]] placed after the nouns, similar to Japanese. Like Japanese, the nominative case has two distinctions, one representing the topic of a sentence and the other the subject.

Most common case markers are the following:\n\n* Nominative - {{lang|ko|\uc774/\uac00}} (i/ga) for the subject, {{lang|ko|\uc740/\ub294}} (eun/neun) for the topic\n* Genitive - {{lang|ko|\uc758}} (ui; although transliterated as ui, nowadays it is pronounced the same as \uc5d0)\n* Dative - {{lang|ko|\uc5d0\uac8c}} (ege), \ud55c\ud14c (hante)\n* Accusative - {{lang|ko|\uc744/\ub97c}} (eul/reul)\n* Lative - {{lang|ko|\uc5d0}} (e), used for destination direction (like in \"to some place\")\n* Ablative - {{lang|ko|\uc5d0\uc11c}} (eseo), used for source direction (like in \"from some place\")\n* Instrumental - {{lang|ko|\ub85c/\uc73c\ub85c}} (ro/uro)\n* Vocative - {{lang|ko|\uc544/\uc57c}} (a/ya)\n\n=== Latin ===\nAn example of a [[Latin]] case inflection is given below, using the singular forms of the Latin term for \"cook,\" which belongs to [[wikt:Appendix:Latin second declension|Latin's second declension class]].\n\n* {{wikt-lang|la|coqu'''us'''}} ([[nominative case|nominative]]) \"[the] cook\" [as a subject] (e.g. {{lang|la|coquus ib\u012b stat}} \u2013 the cook is standing there)\n* {{lang|la|coqu'''\u012b'''}} ([[genitive case|genitive]]) \"[the] cook's / [of the] cook\" (e.g. {{lang|la|n\u014dmen coqu\u012b Claudius est}} \u2013 the cook's name is Claudius)\n* {{lang|la|coqu'''\u014d'''}} ([[dative case|dative]]) \"[to/for the] cook\" [as an indirect object] (e.g. {{lang|la|coqu\u014d d\u014dnum ded\u012b}} \u2013 I gave a present to the cook)\n* {{lang|la|coqu'''um'''}} ([[accusative case|accusative]]) \"[the] cook\" [as a direct object] (e.g. {{lang|la|coquum v\u012bd\u012b}} \u2013 I saw the cook)\n* {{lang|la|coqu'''\u014d'''}} ([[ablative case|ablative]]) \"[by/with/from/in the] cook\" [in various uses not covered by the above] (e.g. {{lang|la|sum altior coqu\u014d}} \u2013 I am taller than the cook: ablative of comparison)\n* {{lang|la|coqu'''e'''}} ([[vocative case|vocative]]) \"[you] the cook\" [addressing the object] (e.g. {{lang|la|gr\u0101ti\u0101s tibi ag\u014d, coque}} \u2013 I thank you, cook)\n\n=== Latvian ===\n{{Main|Latvian declension}}\n\n[[Latvian language|Latvian]] nouns have seven grammatical cases: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, locative and vocative.

In early [[Ancient Greek]], for example, the genitive and ablative cases became combined, giving five cases, rather than the six retained in Latin. In modern [[Hindi]], the Sanskrit cases have been reduced to two: a direct case (for subjects and direct objects) and an [[oblique case]].<ref>R. S. McGregor, ''Outline of Hindi Grammar'', Oxford University Press, 1972.</ref> In English, apart from the pronouns discussed above, case has vanished altogether except for the possessive/non-possessive dichotomy in nouns.\n\nThe evolution of the treatment of case relationships can be circular.<ref name=Blake />{{rp|pp.167\u2013174}} [[Adposition]]s can become unstressed and sound like they are an unstressed syllable of a neighboring word. A postposition can thus merge into the stem of a head noun, developing various forms depending on the phonological shape of the stem. Affixes can then be subject to various phonological processes such as [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], vowel centering to the [[schwa]], phoneme loss, and [[fusion (phonetics)|fusion]], and these processes can reduce or even eliminate the distinctions between cases. Languages can then compensate for the resulting loss of function by creating adpositions, thus coming full circle.\n\nRecent experiments in agent-based modeling have shown how case systems can emerge and evolve in a population of language users.<ref>Remi van Trijp, \"[http://www.remivantrijp.be/pubs/2012/vantrijp2012evolution.pdf The Evolution of Case Systems for Marking Event Structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618054951/http://www.remivantrijp.be/pubs/2012/vantrijp2012evolution.pdf |date=2013-06-18 }}\". In: Steels, Luc (Ed.), Experiments in Cultural Language Evolution, Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2012, p. 169-205.</ref> The experiments demonstrate that language users may introduce new case markers to reduce the cognitive effort required for semantic interpretation, hence facilitating communication through language. Case markers then become generalized through analogical reasoning and reuse.\n\n== Linguistic typology ==\n{{Main|Morphosyntactic alignment}}\n\nLanguages are categorized into several case systems, based on their ''morphosyntactic alignment''\u2014how they group verb [[agent (linguistics)|agents]] and [[patient (linguistics)|patients]] into cases:\n\n* ''[[nominative\u2013accusative language|Nominative\u2013accusative]]'' (or simply ''accusative''): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is in the same case as the agent (subject) of a transitive verb; this case is then called the ''[[nominative case]]'', with the patient (direct object) of a transitive verb being in the ''[[accusative case]]''.\n* ''[[ergative\u2013absolutive language|Ergative\u2013absolutive]]'' (or simply ''ergative''): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is in the same case as the patient (direct object) of a transitive verb; this case is then called the ''[[absolutive case]]'', with the agent (subject) of a transitive verb being in the ''[[ergative case]]''.\n* ''[[ergative\u2013accusative language|Ergative\u2013accusative]]'' (or ''tripartite''): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb is in its own case (the ''[[intransitive case]]''), separate from that of the agent (subject) or patient (direct object) of a transitive verb (which is in the ergative case or accusative case, respectively).\n* ''[[active\u2013stative language|Active\u2013stative]]'' (or simply ''active''): The argument (subject) of an intransitive verb can be in one of two cases; if the argument is an ''agent'', as in \"He ate,\" then it is in the same case as the agent (subject) of a transitive verb (sometimes called the ''agentive case''), and if it is a ''patient'', as in \"He tripped,\" then it is in the same case as the patient (direct object) of a transitive verb (sometimes called the ''patientive case'').\n* ''[[trigger language|Trigger]]'': One noun in a sentence is the topic or focus. This noun is in the [[trigger case]], and information elsewhere in the sentence (for example a [[verb]] [[affix]] in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) specifies the role of the trigger. The trigger may be identified as the agent, patient, etc. Other nouns may be inflected for case, but the inflections are overloaded; for example, in Tagalog, the subject and object of a verb are both expressed in the [[genitive case]] when they are not in the trigger case.\n\nThe following are systems that some languages use to mark case instead of, or in addition to, declension:\n\n* ''Positional'': Nouns are not inflected for case; the position of a noun in the sentence expresses its case.\n* [[Adposition]]al: Nouns are accompanied by words that mark case.\n\nWith a few exceptions, most languages in the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family make extensive use of cases.

Beginning on 20 April 1934, it passed to the administration of ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS) national leader [[Heinrich Himmler]], who in 1936 was appointed Chief of German Police (''Chef der Deutschen Polizei'') by Hitler. The Gestapo at this time becoming a national rather than a Prussian state agency as a suboffice of the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (SiPo) (Security Police). Then, from 27 September 1939 forward, it was administered by the ''[[Reich Main Security Office|Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]'' (RSHA) (Reich Main Security Office) and was considered a sister organisation to the SS ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) (Security Service). During [[World War II]], the Gestapo played a key role in the [[Final Solution|Nazi plan]] to exterminate the Jews of Europe.\n\n==History==\nAs part of the agreement in which [[Adolf Hitler]] became [[Chancellor of Germany]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]\u2014future commander of the [[Luftwaffe]] and the number two man in the Nazi Party\u2014was named [[Interior Minister]] of [[Prussia]].{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=145}} This gave G\u00f6ring command of the largest police force in Germany. Soon afterward, G\u00f6ring detached the political and intelligence sections from the police and filled their ranks with Nazis. On 26 April 1933, G\u00f6ring merged the two units as the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'', which was abbreviated by a post office clerk for a [[franking]] stamp and became known as the \"Gestapo\".{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=146}}{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=64, 65}} He originally wanted to name it the Secret Police Office (''Geheimes Polizeiamt''), but the German initials, \"GPA\", were too similar to those of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ''Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie'' or \"State Political Directorate\", known as the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]].{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=270}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-K0108-0501-003, Rudolf Diels.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rudolf Diels]], first Commander of the Gestapo; 1933\u20131934]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R96954, Berlin, Hermann G\u00f6ring ernennt Himmler zum Leiter der Gestapo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] at the meeting to formally hand over control of the Gestapo (Berlin, 1934).]]\n\nThe first commander of the Gestapo was [[Rudolf Diels]], a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of G\u00f6ring. Diels was appointed with the title of chief of ''Abteilung Ia'' (Department 1a) of the Political Police of the Prussian Interior Ministry.{{sfn|Miller|2006|p=433}} Diels was best known as the primary interrogator of [[Marinus van der Lubbe]] after the [[Reichstag fire|''Reichstag'' fire]]. In late 1933, the ''Reich'' Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] wanted to integrate all the police forces of the German states under his control. G\u00f6ring outflanked him by removing the Prussian political and intelligence departments from the state interior ministry.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|pp=64\u201366}} G\u00f6ring took over the Gestapo in 1934 and urged Hitler to extend the agency's authority throughout Germany. This represented a radical departure from German tradition, which held that law enforcement was (mostly) a ''Land'' (state) and local matter. In this, he ran into conflict with [[Heinrich Himmler]], who was police chief of the second most powerful German state, [[Bavaria]]. Frick did not have the muscle to take on G\u00f6ring by himself so he allied with Himmler. With Frick's support, Himmler (pushed on by his right-hand man, [[Reinhard Heydrich]]) took over the political police of state after state. Soon only Prussia was left.{{sfn|Flaherty|2004|p=66}}\n\nConcerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to effectively counteract the power of the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA), G\u00f6ring handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} Also on that date, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SS Security Service (''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]''; SD).{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}} Himmler and Heydrich both immediately began installing their own personnel in select positions, several of whom were directly from the [[Bavarian Political Police]], such as Heinrich M\u00fcller, Franz Josef Huber, and Josef Meisinger.{{sfn|Tuchel|Schattenfroh|1987|p=80}} Many of the Gestapo employees in the newly established offices were young and highly educated in a wide-variety of academic fields and moreover, represented a new generation of National Socialist adherents, who were hard-working, efficient, and prepared to carry the Nazi state forward through the persecution of their political opponents.{{sfn|Tuchel|Schattenfroh|1987|pp=82\u201383}}\n\nBy the spring of 1934 Himmler's SS controlled the SD and the Gestapo, but for him, there was still a problem, as technically the SS (and the Gestapo by proxy) was subordinated to the [[Sturmabteilung|SA]], which was under the command of [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]].{{sfn|Delarue|2008|pp=102\u2013103}} Himmler wanted to free himself entirely from R\u00f6hm, whom he viewed as an obstacle.{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=29}} R\u00f6hm's position was menacing as more than 4.5 million men fell under his command once the militias and veterans organisations were absorbed by the SA,{{sfn|Benz|2007|p=50}} a fact which fuelled R\u00f6hm's aspirations; his dream of fusing the SA and ''Reichswehr'' together was undermining Hitler's relationships with the leadership of Germany's armed forces.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=159}} Several Nazi chieftains, among them G\u00f6ring, Joseph Goebbels, Rudolf Hess, and Himmler, began a concerted campaign to convince Hitler to take action against R\u00f6hm.{{sfn|Benz|2007|p=51}} Both the SD and Gestapo released information concerning an imminent putsch by the SA.{{sfn|Benz|2007|p=53}} Once persuaded, Hitler acted by setting Himmler's SS into action, who then proceeded to murder over 100 of Hitler's identified antagonists. While members of the Gestapo did not participate in the killing, they supplied the information which implicated the SA and ultimately enabled Himmler and Heydrich to emancipate themselves entirely from the organisation.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=14\u201315}} For the Gestapo, the next two years following the [[Night of the Long Knives]], a term describing the putsch against R\u00f6hm and the SA, were characterised by \"behind-the-scenes political wrangling over policing\".{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Gestapo border inspection stamp - 1938.jpg|thumb|upright|1938 Gestapo border inspection stamp applied when leaving Germany.]]\n\nOn 17 June 1936, Hitler decreed the unification of all police forces in Germany and named Himmler as Chief of German Police.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} This action effectively merged the police into the SS and removed it from Frick's control.  Himmler was nominally subordinate to Frick as police chief, but as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'', he answered only to Hitler. This move also gave Himmler operational control over Germany's entire detective force.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=204}} The Gestapo became a national state agency. Himmler also gained authority over all of Germany's uniformed law enforcement agencies, which were amalgamated into the new ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Orpo: Order Police), which became a national agency under SS general [[Kurt Daluege]].{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} Shortly thereafter, Himmler created the ''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'' (Kripo: Criminal Police), merging it with the Gestapo into the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (SiPo: Security Police), under Heydrich's command.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=201}} [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] was at that time the Gestapo operations chief.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=132}} He answered to Heydrich; Heydrich answered only to Himmler and Himmler answered only to Hitler.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}}\n\nThe Gestapo had the authority to investigate cases of [[treason]], espionage, [[sabotage]] and criminal attacks on the [[Nazi Party]] and Germany. The basic Gestapo law passed by the government in 1936 gave the Gestapo ''[[blank cheque|carte blanche]]'' to operate without [[judicial review]]\u2014in effect, putting it above the law.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=17}} The Gestapo was specifically exempted from responsibility to administrative courts, where citizens normally could sue the state to conform to laws. As early as 1935, a Prussian administrative court had ruled that the Gestapo's actions were not subject to judicial review. The SS officer [[Werner Best]], one-time head of legal affairs in the Gestapo,{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=156}} summed up this policy by saying, \"As long as the police carries out the will of the leadership, it is acting legally.\"{{sfn|Shirer|1990|p=271}}\n\nOn 27 September 1939, the security and police agencies of Nazi Germany\u2014with the exception of the Orpo\u2014were consolidated into the Reich Main Security Office ([[RSHA]]), headed by Heydrich.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=469, 470}}  The Gestapo became ''Amt IV'' (Department IV) of RSHA and M\u00fcller became the Gestapo Chief, with Heydrich as his immediate superior.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=131}} After Heydrich's 1942 assassination, Himmler assumed the leadership of the RSHA until January 1943, when [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] was appointed chief.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=661}} M\u00fcller remained the Gestapo Chief. His direct subordinate [[Adolf Eichmann]] headed the Gestapo's Office of Resettlement and then its Office of Jewish Affairs (''Referat IV B4'' or Sub-Department IV, Section B4).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=145}} During the [[Holocaust]], Eichmann and his agency coordinated the mass deportation of European Jews to the Nazis' [[extermination camps]].{{sfn|USHMM, \"Gestapo\"}}\n\nThe power of the Gestapo included the use of what was called, ''[[Protective custody#Other usages|Schutzhaft]]''\u2014\"protective custody\", a [[euphemism]] for the power to imprison people without judicial proceedings.{{sfn|USHMM, \"Law and Justice in the Third Reich\"}} An oddity of the system was that the prisoner had to sign his own ''Schutzhaftbefehl'', an order declaring that the person had requested imprisonment\u2014presumably out of fear of personal harm. In addition, thousands of [[political prisoner]]s throughout Germany\u2014and from 1941, throughout the occupied territories under the [[Night and Fog Decree]]\u2014simply [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] while in Gestapo custody.{{sfn|Snyder|1994|p=242}}\n\n==Counterintelligence==\nThe [[Polish government in exile]] in London during World War II received sensitive military information about Nazi Germany from agents and informants throughout Europe. After Germany conquered Poland in the autumn of 1939, Gestapo officials believed that they had neutralised Polish intelligence activities. However, certain Polish information about the movement of German police and SS units to the East during the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in the autumn of 1941 was similar to information British intelligence secretly obtained through intercepting and decoding German police and SS messages sent by [[radio telegraphy]].{{sfn|Smith|2004|pp=262\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1942, the Gestapo discovered a cache of Polish intelligence documents in [[Prague]] and were surprised to see that Polish agents and informants had been gathering detailed military information and smuggling it out to London, via [[Budapest]] and [[Istanbul]]. The Poles identified and tracked German military trains to the Eastern front and identified four Orpo battalions sent to conquered areas of the Soviet Union in October 1941 that engaged in war crimes and mass murder.{{sfn|US National Archives, \"German Police Records Opened at the National Archives\"}}\n\nPolish agents also gathered detailed information about the morale of German soldiers in the East. After uncovering a sample of the information the Poles had reported, Gestapo officials concluded that Polish intelligence activity represented a very serious danger to Germany. As late as 6 June 1944, Heinrich M\u00fcller\u2014concerned about the leakage of information to the Allies\u2014set up a special unit called ''Sonderkommando Jerzy'' that was meant to root out the Polish intelligence network in western and southwestern Europe.{{sfn|Breitman|2005|p=139}}\n\n==Resistance==\nEarly in the regime's existence, harsh measures were meted out to political opponents and those who resisted Nazi doctrine (e.g., the Communists), a role the SA performed until the SD and Gestapo undermined their influence and took control of security in the Reich.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|pp=126\u2013140}} Because the Gestapo seemed omniscient and omnipotent, the atmosphere of fear they created led to an overestimation of their reach and strength; a faulty assessment which hampered the operational effectiveness of underground resistance organisations.{{sfn|Merson|1985|p=50}} Antipathy to Hitler and his regime was not tolerated, so the Gestapo had an important role to play in monitoring and prosecuting all who opposed Nazi rule, whether openly or covertly.\n\n===Religious dissent===\nMany parts of Germany (where religious dissent existed upon the Nazi seizure of power) saw a rapid transformation; a change as noted by the Gestapo in conservative towns such as W\u00fcrzburg, where people acquiesced to the regime either through accommodation, collaboration, or simple compliance.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=94\u2013100}} Increasing religious objections to Nazi policies led the Gestapo to carefully monitor church organisations. For the most part, members of the church did not offer political resistance but simply wanted to ensure that organizational doctrine remained intact.{{sfn|McDonough|2005|pp=30\u201340}}\n\nHowever, the Nazi regime sought to suppress any source of ideology other than its own, and set out to muzzle or crush the churches in the so-called ''[[Kirchenkampf]]''. When Church leaders (clergy) voiced their misgiving about the [[Action T4|euthanasia]] program and Nazi racial policies, Hitler intimated that he considered them \"traitors to the people\" and went so far as to call them \"the destroyers of Germany\".{{sfn|Schmid|1947|pp=61\u201363}} The extreme anti-Semitism and neo-Pagan heresies of the Nazis caused some Christians to outright resist,{{sfn|Benz|2007|pp=42\u201347}} and Pope Pius XI to issue the encyclical [[Mit Brennender Sorge]] denouncing Nazism and warning Catholics against joining or supporting the Party. Some pastors, like the Protestant clergyman [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], paid for their opposition with their lives.{{sfn|McDonough|2005|pp=32\u201333}}{{Efn|Bonhoeffer was an active opponent of Nazism in the German resistance movement. Arrested by the Gestapo in 1943, he was sent to [[Buchenwald]] and later to Flossenb\u00fcrg concentration camp where he was executed.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=727}} }}\n\nIn an effort to counter the strength and influence of spiritual resistance, Nazi records reveal that the Gestapo's ''Referat B1'' monitored the activities of bishops very closely\u2014instructing that agents be set up in every diocese, that the bishops' reports to the Vatican should be obtained and that the bishops' areas of activity must be found out. Deans were to be targeted as the \"eyes and ears of the bishops\" and a \"vast network\" established to monitor the activities of ordinary clergy: \"The importance of this enemy is such that inspectors of security police and of the security service will make this group of people and the questions discussed by them their special concern\".{{sfn|Berben|1975|pp=141\u2013142}}\n\nIn ''Dachau: The Official History 1933\u20131945'', Paul Berben wrote that clergy were watched closely, and frequently denounced, arrested and sent to concentration camps: \"One priest was imprisoned in Dachau for having stated that there were good folk in England too; another suffered the same fate for warning a girl who wanted to marry an S.S. man after abjuring the Catholic faith; yet another because he conducted a service for a deceased communist\". Others were arrested simply on the basis of being \"suspected of activities hostile to the State\" or that there was reason to \"suppose that his dealings might harm society\".{{sfn|Berben|1975|p=142}} Over 2700 Catholic, Protestant and Orthodox clergy were imprisoned at Dachau alone. After Heydrich (who was staunchly anti-Catholic and anti-Christian) was assassinated in Prague, his successor, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, relaxed some of the policies and then disbanded Department IVB (religious opponents) of the Gestapo.{{sfn|Steigmann-Gall|2003|pp=251\u2013252}}\n\n===Student opposition===\nBetween June 1942 and March 1943, student protests were calling for an end to the Nazi regime. These included the non-violent resistance of [[Hans Scholl|Hans]] and [[Sophie Scholl]], two leaders of the [[White Rose]] student group.{{sfn|McDonough|2005|pp=21\u201329}} However, resistance groups and those who were in moral or political opposition to the Nazis were stalled by the fear of reprisals from the Gestapo. Fearful of an internal overthrow, the forces of the Gestapo were unleashed on the opposition.{{Efn|Groups like the [[White Rose]] and others, such as the [[Edelweiss Pirates]], and the [[Swing Youth]], were placed under strict Gestapo observation. Some participants were sent to concentration camps. Leading members of the most famous of these groups, the White Rose, were arrested by the police and turned over to the Gestapo. For several leaders their punishment was death.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|pp=118\u2013119}} }} The first five months of 1943 witnessed thousands of arrests and executions as the Gestapo exercised their powers over the German public. Student opposition leaders were executed in late February, and a major opposition organisation, the [[Hans Oster|Oster Circle]], was destroyed in April 1943.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|p=318}} Efforts to resist the Nazi regime amounted to very little and had only minor chances of success, particularly since the broad percentage of the German people did not support oppositional movements.{{sfn|Johnson|1999|p=306}}\n\n===General opposition and military conspiracy===\nBetween 1934 and 1938, opponents of the Nazi regime and their fellow travellers began to emerge. Among the first to speak out were religious dissenters but following in their wake were educators, aristocratic businessmen, office workers, teachers, and others from nearly every walk of life.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|p=28}} Most people quickly learned that open opposition was dangerous since Gestapo informants and agents were widespread. Yet a significant number of them still worked against the National Socialist government.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nDuring May 1935, the Gestapo broke up and arrested members of the \"Markwitz Circle\", a group of former socialists in contact with [[Otto Strasser]], who sought Hitler's downfall.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|p=30}} From the mid-1930s into the early 1940s\u2014various groups made up of communists, idealists, working-class people, and far-right conservative opposition organisations covertly fought against Hitler's government, and several of them fomented plots that included Hitler's assassination. Nearly all of them, including: the R\u00f6mer Group, Robby Group, Solf Circle, ''Schwarze Reichswehr'', the Party of the Radical Middle Class, ''Jungdeutscher Orden'', ''Schwarze Front'' and ''Stahlhelm'' were either discovered or infiltrated by the Gestapo. This led to corresponding arrests, being sent to concentration camps and execution.{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|pp=30\u201332}} One of the methods employed by the Gestapo to contend with these resistance factions was 'protective detention' which facilitated the process in expediting dissenters to concentration camps and against which there was no legal defence.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=58}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R98680, Besprechung Himmler mit M\u00fcller, Heydrich, Nebe, Huber2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|Photograph from 1939: shown from left to right are [[Franz Josef Huber]], [[Arthur Nebe]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Reinhard Heydrich]] and [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] planning the investigation of the bomb assassination attempt on [[Adolf Hitler]] on 8 November 1939 in [[Munich]].]]\n\nEarly efforts to resist the Nazis with aid from abroad were hindered when the opposition's peace feelers to the Western Allies did not meet with success. This was partly because of the [[Venlo incident]] of 9 November 1939,{{sfn|Hoffmann|1977|p=121}} in which SD and Gestapo agents, posing as anti-Nazis in the [[Netherlands]], kidnapped two British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (SIS) officers after having lured them to a meeting to discuss peace terms. This prompted [[Winston Churchill]] to ban any further contact with the German opposition.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=144}} Later, the British and Americans did not want to deal with anti-Nazis because they were fearful that the Soviet Union would believe they were attempting to make deals behind their back.{{Efn|More than that, the Anglo-American common language and capital interests kept Stalin at a distance since he felt the other Allied powers were hoping the fascists and Communists would destroy one another.{{sfn|Overy|1997|pp=245\u2013281}} }}\n\nThe German opposition was in an unenviable position by the late spring and early summer of 1943. On one hand, it was next to impossible for them to overthrow Hitler and the party; on the other, the Allied demand for an unconditional surrender meant no opportunity for a compromise peace, which left the military and conservative aristocrats who opposed the regime no option (in their eyes) other than continuing the military struggle.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|pp=86\u201387}} Despite fear of the Gestapo after mass arrests and executions in the spring, the opposition still plotted and planned. One of the more famous schemes, [[Operation Valkyrie]], involved a number of senior German officers and was carried out by Colonel [[Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]]. In an attempt to assassinate Hitler, Stauffenberg planted a bomb underneath a conference table inside the [[Wolf's Lair]] field headquarters.{{sfn|Benz|2007|pp=245\u2013249}} Known as the [[20 July plot]], this assassination attempt failed and Hitler was only slightly injured. Reports indicate that the Gestapo was caught unaware of this plot as they did not have sufficient protections in place at the appropriate locations nor did they take any preventative steps.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=323}}{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=532}} Stauffenberg and his group were shot on 21 July 1944; meanwhile, his fellow conspirators were rounded up by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp. Thereafter, there was a show trial overseen by [[Roland Freisler]], followed by their execution.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|p=537}}\n\nSome Germans were convinced that it was their duty to apply all possible expedients to end the war as quickly as possible. Sabotage efforts were undertaken by members of the ''Abwehr'' (military intelligence) leadership, as they recruited people known to oppose the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Spielvogel|1992|p=256}} The Gestapo cracked down ruthlessly on dissidents in Germany, just as they did everywhere else. Opposition became more difficult. Arrests, torture, and executions were common. Terror against \"state enemies\" had become a way of life to such a degree that the Gestapo's presence and methods were eventually normalised in the minds of people living in Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Peukert|1989|pp=198\u2013199}}\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R97512, Berlin, Geheimes Staatspolizeihauptamt.jpg|thumb|267px|Gestapo headquarters at [[8 Prinz Albrecht Street]] in Berlin (1933)]]\n\nIn January 1933, [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], Hitler's [[minister without portfolio]], was appointed the head of the Prussian Police and began filling the political and intelligence units of the [[Prussian Secret Police]] with [[Nazi Party]] members.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=150}} A year after the organisations inception, G\u00f6ring wrote in a British publication about having created the organisation on his own initiative and how he was \"chiefly responsible\" for the elimination of the Marxist and Communist threat to Germany and Prussia.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|p=97}} Describing the activities of the organisation, G\u00f6ring boasted about the utter ruthlessness required for Germany's recovery, the establishment of concentration camps for that purpose, and even went on to claim that excesses were committed in the beginning, recounting how beatings took place here and there.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|2011|pp=97\u201398}} On 26 April 1933, he reorganised the force's ''Amt III'' as the ''Gestapa'' (better-known by the \"sobriquet\" Gestapo),{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=85}} a secret state police intended to serve the Nazi cause.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=150, 162}} Less than two weeks later in early May 1933, the Gestapo moved into their Berlin headquarters at Prinz-Albrecht-Stra\u00dfe 8.{{sfn|Tuchel|Schattenfroh|1987|p=72}}\n\nWith its 1936 merging with the Kripo (National criminal police) to form sub-units of the ''Sicherheitspolizei'' (SiPo; Security Police), the Gestapo was classified as a government agency. Himmler by his appointment to ''Chef der Deutschen Polizei'' (Chief of German Police), along with serving as ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' made him independent of Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick's nominal control.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=204}}\n\nThe SiPo was placed under the direct command of Reinhard Heydrich who was already chief of the Nazi Party's intelligence service, the ''Sicherheitsdienst'' (SD).{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} The idea was to fully combine the party agency, the SD, with the SiPo, the state agency. SiPo members were encouraged to become members of the SS. However, in practise, the SiPo and the SD came into jurisdictional and operational conflict. Gestapo and Kripo had many experienced, professional policemen and investigators, who considered the SD to be a less competent agency, amateurs who were \"good Nazis but bad detectives\".\n\nIn September 1939, the SiPo together with the SD were merged into the newly created ''Reichssicherheitshauptamt'' (RSHA: Reich Main Security Office). Both the Gestapo and Kripo became distinct departments within the RSHA.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|pp=469, 470}} Although the ''Sicherheitspolizei'' was officially disbanded, the term SiPo was figuratively used to describe any RSHA personnel throughout the remainder of the war.  In lieu of naming convention changes, the original construct of the SiPo, Gestapo, and Kripo cannot be fully comprehended as \"discrete entities\", since they ultimately formed \"a conglomerate in which each was wedded to each other and the SS through its Security Service, the SD\".{{sfn|Browder|1996|p=103}}\n\nThe creation of the RSHA represented the formalisation, at the top level, of the relationship under which the SD served as the intelligence agency for the security police. A similar co-ordination existed in the local offices. Within Germany and areas which were incorporated within the Reich for the purpose of civil administration, local offices of the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD were formally separate. They were subject to co-ordination by inspectors of the security police and SD on the staffs of the local higher SS and police leaders, however, and one of the principal functions of the local SD units was to serve as the intelligence agency for the local Gestapo units. In the occupied territories, the formal relationship between local units of the Gestapo, criminal police, and SD was slightly closer.<ref>Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression (1946) p. 92.</ref>\n\nThe Gestapo became known as RSHA ''Amt IV'' (\"Department or Office IV\") with [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] as its chief.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=131}} In January 1943, Himmler appointed [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]] RSHA chief; almost seven months after Heydrich had been [[Operation Anthropoid|assassinated]].{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=661}} The specific internal departments of ''Amt IV'' were as follows:{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=160, 161}}\n\n===Department A (Political Opponents)===\n*Communists (A1)\n*Counter-sabotage (A2)\n*Reactionaries, liberals and opposition (A3)\n*Protective services (A4)\n\n===Department B (Sects and Churches)===\n*Catholicism (B1)\n*Protestantism (B2)\n*Freemasons and other churches (B3)\n*Jewish affairs (B4)\n\n===Department C (Administration and Party Affairs)===\nCentral administrative office of the Gestapo, responsible for card files of all personnel including all officials.\n*Files, card, indexes, information and administration (C1)\n*Protective custody (C2)\n*Press office (C3)\n*NSDAP matters (C4)\n\n===Department D (Occupied Territories)===\nAdministration for regions outside the ''Reich''.\n*Protectorate affairs, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, regions of Yugoslavia, Greece (D1)\n**[[1st Belgrade Special Combat detachment]]\n*General Government(D2)\n*Confidential office - hostile foreigners, emigrants (D3)\n*Occupied territories - France, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Denmark (D4)\n*Occupied Eastern territories (D5)\n\n===Department E (Security and counterintelligence)===\n*In the ''Reich'' (E1)\n*Policy and economic formation (E2)\n*West (E3)\n*Scandinavia (North)(E4)\n*East (E5)\n*South (E6)\n\nIn 1941 ''Referat N'', the central command office of the Gestapo was formed. However, these internal departments remained and the Gestapo continued to be a department under the RSHA umbrella. The local offices of the Gestapo, known as Gestapo ''Leitstellen'' and ''Stellen'', answered to a local commander known as the ''Inspekteur der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD'' (\"Inspector of the Security Police and Security Service\") who, in turn, was under the dual command of ''Referat N'' of the Gestapo and also his local [[SS and Police Leader]].{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=47}}{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nThe Gestapo also maintained offices at all [[Nazi concentration camps]], held an office on the staff of the SS and Police Leaders, and supplied personnel as needed to formations such as the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]''. Personnel assigned to these auxiliary duties were often removed from the Gestapo chain of command and fell under the authority of branches of the SS.\n\n===Ranks===\nThe Gestapo maintained police detective ranks which were used for all officers, both those who were and who were not concurrently SS members.{{Efn|Although an agent in uniform wore the collar insignia of the equivalent SS rank, he was still addressed as, e.g., ''Herr Kriminalrat'', not ''Sturmbannf\u00fchrer''.

For the most part they were young professional civil service officers...\"{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=51}} The Nazis valued police competence more than politics, so in general in 1933, almost all of the men who served in the various state police forces under the Weimar Republic stayed on in their jobs.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=54\u201355}} In [[W\u00fcrzburg]], which is one of the few places in Germany where most of the Gestapo records survived, every member of the Gestapo was a career policeman or had a police background.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=59}}\n\nThe Canadian historian [[Robert Gellately]] wrote that most Gestapo men were not Nazis, but at the same time were not opposed to the Nazi regime, which they were willing to serve, in whatever task they were called upon to perform.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=59}} Over time, membership in the Gestapo included ideological training, particularly once Werner Best assumed a leading role for training in April 1936. Employing biological metaphors, Best emphasised a doctrine which encouraged members of the Gestapo to view themselves as 'doctors' to the national body in the struggle against \"pathogens\" and \"diseases\"; among the implied sicknesses were \"communists, Freemasons, and the churches\u2014and above and behind all these stood the Jews\".{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=30}} Heydrich thought along similar lines and advocated both defensive and offensive measures on the part of the Gestapo, so as to prevent any subversion or destruction of the National Socialist body.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=31}}\n\nWhether trained as police originally or not, Gestapo agents themselves were shaped by their socio-political environment. Historian George C. Browder contends that there was a four-part process (authorisation, bolstering, routinisation, and dehumanisation) in effect which legitimised the psycho-social atmosphere conditioning members of the Gestapo to radicalised violence.{{sfn|Browder|1996|pp=33\u201334}} Browder also describes a sandwich effect, where from above; Gestapo agents were subjected to ideologically oriented racism and criminal biological theories; and from below, the Gestapo was transformed by SS personnel who did not have the proper police training, which showed in their propensity for unrestrained violence.{{sfn|Browder|1996|pp=88\u201390}} This admixture certainly shaped the Gestapo's public image which they sought to maintain in lieu of their increasing workload; an image which helped them identify and eliminate enemies of the Nazi state.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=186\u2013193}}\n\n===Uniforms===\n{{refimprove|section|date=April 2017}}\nFrom June 1936, a concerted effort was made to recruit policemen of the SiPo into the SS, and SS members into the Kripo and especially the Gestapo, but with limited success; by 1939 only a small percentage of Gestapo agents were SS members. With the formation of RSHA in September 1939, Gestapo officers who also held SS rank began to wear the wartime grey [[Uniforms and insignia of the Schutzstaffel|SS uniform]] when on duty in the ''Hauptamt'' or regional headquarters (''Abschnitte''). Hollywood notwithstanding, after 1939 the black SS uniform was only worn by ''[[Allgemeine SS]]'' reservists. Outside the central offices, Gestapo agents working out of the ''Stapostellen'' and ''Stapoleitstellen'' continued to wear civilian suits in keeping with the secretive nature of their work.\n\nThere were strict protocols protecting the identity of Gestapo field personnel. When asked for identification, an operative was only required to present his warrant disc. This identified the operative as Gestapo without revealing personal identity and agents, except when ordered to do so by an authorised official, were not required to show picture identification, something all non-Gestapo people were expected to do. Nevertheless, the sight of dark leather coats and black SS uniforms along with the very mention of the word \"Gestapo\" elicited fear among the general population.{{sfn|Frei|1993|pp=106\u2013107}}\n\nBeginning in 1940, the grey SS uniform was worn by Gestapo in occupied countries of the east, even those who were not actually SS members, because agents in civilian clothes had been shot by members of the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' thinking they were partisans.\n\nUnlike the rest of the SS, the right-side collar patch of the RSHA was plain black without insignia, as was the uniform cuffband. Gestapo agents in uniform did not wear SS shoulderboards, but rather [[Ranks and insignia of the Ordnungspolizei|police-pattern shoulderboards]] piped or underlaid in \"poison green\" (''giftgr\u00fcn''). A diamond-shaped black patch with \"SD\" in white was worn on the lower left sleeve even by SiPo men who were not in the SD. Sometimes this ''Raute'' (diamond) was piped in white; there is some debate over whether this may or may not have indicated Gestapo personnel.\n\n==Population ratios, methods and effectiveness==\nContrary to popular belief, the Gestapo was not the all-pervasive, omnipotent agency in German society.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=163}} In Germany proper, many towns and cities had fewer than 50 official Gestapo personnel. For example, in 1939 Stettin and Frankfurt am Main only had a total of 41 Gestapo men combined.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=163}} In [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], the local Gestapo office of only 281 men were responsible for the entire Lower Rhine region, which comprised 4 million people.{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|p=174}} \"V-men\", as undercover Gestapo agents were known, were used to infiltrate [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] and [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist]] opposition groups, but this was more the exception, not the rule.{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|p=181}} The Gestapo office in [[Saarbr\u00fccken]] had 50 full-term informers in 1939.{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|p=181}} The District Office in [[Nuremberg]], which had the responsibility for all of northern [[Bavaria]], employed a total of 80\u2013100 full-term informers between 1943 and 1945.{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|p=181}} The majority of Gestapo informers were not full-term informers working undercover, but were rather ordinary citizens who chose to denounce other people to the Gestapo.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=132\u2013150}}\n\nAccording to Canadian historian [[Robert Gellately]]'s analysis of the local offices established, the Gestapo was\u2014for the most part\u2014made up of bureaucrats and clerical workers who depended upon denunciations by citizens for their information. Gellately argued that it was because of the widespread willingness of Germans to inform on each other to the Gestapo that Germany between 1933 and 1945 was a prime example of [[panopticism]].{{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=11\u201312, 22}} The Gestapo\u2014at times\u2014was overwhelmed with denunciations and most of its time was spent sorting out the credible from the less credible denunciations.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=65}} Many of the local offices were understaffed and overworked, struggling with the paper load caused by so many denunciations.{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|p=175}} Gellately has also suggested that the Gestapo was \"a reactive organisation\" \"...&nbsp;which was constructed within German society and whose functioning was structurally dependent on the continuing co-operation of German citizens\".{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=136}}\n\nAfter 1939, when many Gestapo personnel were called up for war-related work such as service with the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', the level of overwork and understaffing at the local offices increased.{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|p=175}} For information about what was happening in German society, the Gestapo continued to be mostly dependent upon denunciations.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=64}} 80% of all Gestapo investigations were started in response to information provided by denunciations by ordinary Germans; while 10% were started in response to information provided by other branches of the German government and another 10% started in response to information that the Gestapo itself unearthed.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=65}} The information supplied by denunciations often led the Gestapo in determining who was arrested.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=64}}\n\nThe popular picture of the Gestapo with its spies everywhere terrorising German society has been rejected by many historians as a myth invented after the war as a cover for German society's widespread complicity in allowing the Gestapo to work.{{sfn|Rees|1997|p=64}}{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|pp=168\u2013169}} Work done by [[social history|social historians]] such as [[Detlev Peukert]], Robert Gellately, Reinhard Mann, Inge Marssolek, Ren\u00e9 Otto, Klaus-Michael Mallamann and Paul Gerhard, which by focusing on what the local offices were doing has shown the Gestapo{{'}}s almost total dependence on denunciations from ordinary Germans, and very much discredited the older \"Big Brother\" picture with the Gestapo having its eyes and ears everywhere.{{sfn|Mallmann|Paul|1994|pp=172\u2013173}} For example, of the 84 cases in [[W\u00fcrzburg]] of ''[[Rassenschande]]'' (\"race defilement\"\u2014sexual relations with non-Aryans), 45 (54%) were started in response to denunciations by ordinary people, two (2%) by information provided by other branches of the government, 20 (24%) via information gained during interrogations of people relating to other matters, four (5%) from information from (Nazi) NSDAP organisations, two (2%) during \"political evaluations\" and 11 (13%) have no source listed while none were started by Gestapo{{'}}s own \"observations\" of the people of W\u00fcrzburg.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=162}}\n\nAn examination of 213 denunciations in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]] showed that 37% were motivated by personal conflicts, no motive could be established in 39%, and 24% were motivated by support for the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=146}} The Gestapo always showed a special interest in denunciations concerning sexual matters, especially cases concerning ''Rassenschande'' with Jews or between Germans and foreigners, in particular Polish slave workers; the Gestapo applied even harsher methods to the foreign workers in the country, especially those from Poland,{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=259}} Jews, Catholics and homosexuals. {{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=49, 146}} As time went by, anonymous denunciations to the Gestapo caused trouble to various NSDAP officials, who often found themselves being investigated by the Gestapo.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|pp=151\u2013152}}\n\nOf the political cases, 61 people were investigated for suspicion of belonging to the KPD, 44 for the SPD and 69 for other political parties.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=48}} Most of the political investigations took place between 1933 and 1935 with the all-time high of 57 cases in 1935.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=48}} After that year, political investigations declined with only 18 investigations in 1938, 13 in 1939, two in 1941, seven in 1942, four in 1943 and one in 1944.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=48}} The \"other\" category associated with non-conformity included everything from a man who drew a caricature of Hitler to a Catholic teacher suspected of being lukewarm about teaching National Socialism in his classroom.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=48}} The \"administrative control\" category concerned whose were breaking the law concerning residency in the city.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=48}} The \"conventional criminality\" category concerned economic crimes such as money laundering, smuggling and homosexuality.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=49}}\n\nNormal methods of investigation included various forms of blackmail, threats and extortion to secure \"confessions\".{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=131}} Beyond that, sleep deprivation and various forms of harassment were used as investigative methods.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=131}} Failing that, torture and planting evidence were common methods of resolving a case, especially if the case concerned someone Jewish.{{sfn|Gellately|1992|p=132}} Brutality on the part of interrogators\u2014often prompted by denunciations and followed with roundups\u2014enabled the Gestapo to uncover numerous resistance networks; it also made them seem like they knew everything and could do anything they wanted.{{sfn|Ay\u00e7oberry|1999|p=272}}\n\nWhile the total numbers of Gestapo officials was limited when contrasted against the represented populations, the average ''Volksgenosse'' (Nazi term for the \"member of the German people\") was typically not under observation, so the statistical ratio between Gestapo officials and inhabitants is \"largely worthless and of little significance\" according to some recent scholars.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=35}} As historian Eric Johnson remarked, \"The Nazi terror was selective terror\", with its focus upon political opponents, ideological dissenters (clergy and religious organisations), career criminals, the Sinti and Roma population, handicapped persons, homosexuals and above all, upon the Jews.{{sfn|Johnson|1999|pp=483\u2013485}} \"Selective terror\" by the Gestapo, as mentioned by Johnson, is also supported by historian Richard Evans who states that, \"Violence and intimidation rarely touched the lives of most ordinary Germans. Denunciation was the exception, not the rule, as far as the behaviour of the vast majority of Germans was concerned.\"{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=114}} The involvement of ordinary Germans in denunciations also needs to be put into perspective so as not to exonerate the Gestapo. As Evans makes clear, \"...it was not the ordinary German people who engaged in surveillance, it was the Gestapo; nothing happened until the Gestapo received a denunciation, and it was the Gestapo's active pursuit of deviance and dissent that was the only thing that gave denunciations meaning.\"{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=115}} The Gestapo's effectiveness remained in the ability to \"project\" omnipotence...they co-opted the assistance of the German population by using denunciations to their advantage; proving in the end a powerful, ruthless and effective organ of terror under the Nazi regime that was seemingly everywhere.{{sfn|Delarue|2008|pp=83\u2013140}} Lastly, the Gestapo's effectiveness, while aided by denunciations and the watchful eye of ordinary Germans, was more the result of the co-ordination and co-operation amid the various police organs within Germany, the assistance of the SS, and the support provided by the various Nazi Party organisations; all of them together forming an organised persecution network.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|p=82}}\n\n==Nuremberg trials==\n{{main article|Nuremberg trials|the Holocaust}}\n[[File:Capturedgestapoagents.jpg|thumb|German Gestapo agents arrested after the liberation of [[Li\u00e8ge]], Belgium, are herded together in a cell at the [[Citadel of Li\u00e8ge]], October 1944]]\n\nBetween 14 November 1945 and 3 October 1946, the Allies established an [[International Military Tribunal]] (IMT) to try 22 of 24 major Nazi war criminals and six groups for [[crimes against peace]], [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]].{{sfn|Bernstein|1947|pp=267\u2013275}} Nineteen of the 22 were convicted, and twelve of them (Bormann [in absentia], Frank, Frick, G\u00f6ring, Jodl, Kaltenbrunner, Keitel, Ribbentrop, Rosenberg, Sauckel, Seyss-Inquart, Streicher), were each given the death penalty; the remaining three (Funk, Hess, Raeder) received life terms. At that time, the Gestapo was condemned as a criminal organisation, along with the SS.<ref>''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression'' (1946). pp. 189\u2013190.</ref> However, Gestapo leader [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] was never tried, as he disappeared at the end of the war.{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=176\u2013177}}{{Efn|There were reports that M\u00fcller ended up in the foreign secret service at Washington D.C., some allege he was in Moscow working for the Soviets, still others claimed he escaped to South America\u2014but none of the myths have ever been proven; all of which adds to the \"mysterious power of the Gestapo\".{{sfn|Dams|Stolle|2014|pp=176\u2013177}} }}\n\nLeaders, organisers, investigators and accomplices participating in the formulation or execution of a common plan or conspiracy to commit the crimes specified were declared responsible for all acts performed by any persons in execution of such plan. The official positions of defendants as heads of state or holders of high government offices were not to free them from responsibility or mitigate their punishment; nor was the fact that a defendant acted pursuant to an order of a superior to excuse him from responsibility, although it might be considered by the IMT in mitigation of punishment.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/chap15_part01.asp ''Nazi Conspiracy and Aggression'' Volume 2, Chapter XV, Part 1. (accessed 4 October 2014)]</ref>\n\nAt the trial of any individual member of any group or organisation, the IMT was authorised to declare (in connection with any act of which the individual was convicted) that the group or organisation to which he belonged was a criminal organisation. When a group or organisation was thus declared criminal, the competent national authority of any signatory had the right to bring persons to trial for membership in that organisation, with the criminal nature of the group or organisation assumed proved.{{sfn|Bernstein|1947|pp=246\u2013259}}\n\nThese groups\u2014the [[Nazism|Nazi]] party and government leadership, the German [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|General staff and High Command]] (OKW); the ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA); the ''[[Schutzstaffel]]'' (SS), including the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD); and the Gestapo\u2014had an aggregate membership exceeding two million, making a large number of their members liable to trial when the organisations were convicted.<ref name=\"archives.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/iwg/research-papers/trial-of-war-criminals-before-imt.html|title=The Trial of the Major War Criminals|date=25 October 2010|website=archives.gov}}</ref>\n\nThe trials began in November 1945.

Gestapo members Hermann G\u00f6ring, Ernst Kaltenbrunner and [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] were individually convicted. Three groups were acquitted of collective war crimes charges, but this did not relieve individual members of those groups from conviction and punishment under the [[denazification]] programme.

[[Agglutinative]] and [[polysynthetic language]]s tend to have the most complex conjugations albeit some [[fusional language]]s such as [[Archi language|Archi]] can also have extremely complex conjugation.  Typically the principal parts are the [[root (linguistics)|root]] and/or several modifications of it ([[stem (linguistics)|stem]]s). All the different forms of the same verb constitute a [[lexeme]], and the [[Canon (basic principle)|canonical]] form of the verb that is conventionally used to represent that lexeme (as seen in dictionary entries) is called a [[lemma (morphology)|lemma]].\n\nThe term conjugation is applied only to the inflection of verbs, and not of other parts of speech (inflection of [[noun]]s and [[adjective]]s is known as [[declension]]). Also it is often restricted to denoting the formation of [[finite verb|finite forms]] of a verb \u2013 these may be referred to as ''conjugated forms'', as opposed to [[non-finite verb|non-finite forms]], such as the [[infinitive]] or [[gerund]], which tend not to be marked for most of the grammatical categories.\n\n'''Correlative conjunctions''' come in pairs some are: both...and        either...or      ex: She'd <u>'''rather'''</u> play the drums <u>'''than'''</u> sing. \n\n'''Conjugation''' is also the traditional name for a group of verbs that share a similar conjugation pattern in a particular language (a ''verb class''). For example, [[Latin]] is said to have four conjugations of verbs. This means that any [[regular verb|regular]] Latin verb can be conjugated in any person, number, tense, mood, and voice by knowing which of the four conjugation groups it belongs to, and its principal parts. A verb that does not follow all of the standard conjugation patterns of the language is said to be an [[irregular verb]]. The system of all conjugated variants of a particular verb or class of verbs is called a '''verb paradigm'''; this may be presented in the form of a '''conjugation table'''.\n\n==Examples==\n[[Indo-European languages]] usually [[inflection|inflect]] verbs for several grammatical categories in complex [[Inflectional paradigm|paradigm]]s, although some, like English, have simplified verb conjugation to a large extent. Below is the conjugation of the verb ''to be'' in the present tense (of the infinitive, if it exists, and indicative moods), in [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Afrikaans]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Latvian language|Latvian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Urdu]] or [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Latin]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Ancient Attic Greek]] and [[Modern Greek]]. This is usually the most irregular verb. The similarities in corresponding verb forms may be noticed. Some of the conjugations may be disused, like the English ''[[thou]]''-form, or have additional meanings, like the English ''[[you]]''-form, which can also stand for second person singular or be [[generic you|impersonal]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ |\"To be\" in several Indo-European languages\n|-\n!

See, [[Indo-European copula]]\n</small>\n\n==Verbal agreement==\n\n'''Verbal agreement''' or '''concord''' is a [[morphology (linguistics)|morpho]]-[[syntax|syntactic]] construct in which properties of the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and/or [[object (grammar)|object]]s of a [[verb]] are indicated by the verb form.  Verbs are then said to [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] with their subjects (resp. objects).\n\nMany [[English language|English]] verbs exhibit subject agreement of the following sort: whereas ''I go'', ''you go'', ''we go'', ''they go'' are all grammatical in standard English, ''she go'' is not (except in the [[subjunctive]], as \"They requested that ''she go'' with them\").  Instead, a special form of the verb ''to go'' has to be used to produce ''she goes''.  On the other hand ''I goes'', ''you goes'' etc. are not grammatical in standard English.  (Things are different in some English dialects that lack agreement.)  A few English verbs have no special forms that indicate subject agreement (''I may'', ''you may'', ''she may''), and the verb ''to be'' has an additional form ''am'' that can only be used with the pronoun ''I'' as the subject.\n\nVerbs in written [[French verbs|French]] exhibit more intensive agreement [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] than English verbs: ''je suis'' (I am), ''tu es'' (\"you are\", singular [[T-V distinction|informal]]), ''elle est'' (she is), ''nous sommes'' (we are), ''vous \u00eates'' (\"you are\", plural), ''ils sont'' (they are).  Historically, English used to have a similar verbal paradigm. Some historic verb forms are used by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] as slightly archaic or more formal variants (''I do'', ''thou dost'', ''she doth'', typically used by nobility) of the modern forms.\n\nSome languages with verbal agreement can leave certain subjects [[null-subject language|implicit]] when the subject is fully determined by the verb form. In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], for instance, subject pronouns do not need to be explicitly present, even though in French, its close relative, they are obligatory. The Spanish equivalent to the French ''je suis'' (I am) can be simply ''soy'' (lit. \"am\").  The pronoun ''yo'' (I) in the explicit form ''yo soy'' is only required for emphasis or to clear ambiguity in complex texts.\n\nSome languages have a richer agreement system in which verbs also agree with some or all of their objects. [[Ubykh language|Ubykh]] exhibits verbal agreement for the subject, direct object, indirect object, benefaction and ablative objects (''a.w3.s.xe.n.t'u.n'', ''you gave it to him for me'').\n\n[[Basque language|Basque]] can show agreement not only for subject, direct object and indirect object, but it also on occasion exhibits agreement for the listener as the implicit benefactor: ''autoa ekarri digute'' means \"they brought us the car\" (neuter agreement for listener), but ''autoa ekarri ziguten'' means \"they brought us the car\" (agreement for feminine singular listener).\n\nLanguages with a rich agreement morphology facilitate relatively free word order without leading to increased ambiguity. The canonical word order in Basque is subject\u2013object\u2013verb. However, all permutations of subject, verb and object are permitted.\n\n===Nonverbal person agreement===\nIn some languages,<ref>Stassen, Leon; '''Intransitive Predication (Oxford Studies in Typology and Linguistic Theory)'''; published 1997 by [[Oxford University Press]]; p. 39. {{ISBN|0-19-925893-7}}</ref> predicative [[adjective]]s and [[Copula (linguistics)|copular]] complements receive a form of person agreement that is distinct from that used on ordinary [[predicative verb]]s. Although this is a form of conjugation in that it refers back to the person of the subject, it is not \u201cverbal\u201d because it always derives from [[pronoun]]s that have become [[clitic]]ised to the nouns to which they refer.<ref>Stassen; '''Intransitive Predication'''; pp. 77 & 284-288</ref> An example of nonverbal person agreement, along with contrasting verbal conjugation, can be found from [[Beja language|Beja]]<ref name=\"Stassen40\">Stassen, '''Intransitive Predication'''; p. 40</ref> (person agreement affixes in bold):\n\n* ''wun.tu.'''wi''''', \u201cyou (fem.) are big\u201d\n* ''had\u00e1.b.'''wa''''', \u201cyou (masc.) are a sheik\u201d\n* '''''e'''.n.f\u00f3r'', \u201che flees\u201d\n\nAnother example can be found from [[Ket language|Ket]]:<ref name=\"Stassen40\"/>\n\n* ''f\u00e8mba.'''di''''', \u201cI am a [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]]\u201d\n* '''''d\u0268'''.fen'', \u201cI am standing\u201d\n\nIn [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], and a few [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] and [[indigenous Australian languages|Australian Aboriginal languages]], predicative adjectives and copular complements take affixes that are identical to those used on predicative verbs, but their [[negation (linguistics)|negation]] is different. For example, in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]:\n\n* ''ko\u015f.u.yor.'''sun''''' \u201cyou are running\u201d\n* ''\u00e7avu\u015f.'''sun''''' \u201cyou are a sergeant\u201d\n\nUnder negation this becomes (negative affixes in bold):\n\n* ''ko\u015f.'''mu'''.yor.sun'' \u201cyou are not running\u201d\n* ''\u00e7avu\u015f '''de\u011fil'''.sin'' \u201cyou are not a sergeant\u201d\n\nFor this reason, the person agreement affixes used with predicative adjectives and nominals in Turkic languages are considered to be nonverbal in character. In some analyses, they are viewed as a form of verbal takeover by a copular strategy.\n\n==Factors that affect conjugation==<!-- \"Verb form\" redirects here -->\nCommon [[grammatical category|grammatical categories]] according to which verbs can be conjugated are the following:\n*[[Finite verb|Finite verb forms]]:\n**[[Grammatical person]]\n**[[Grammatical number]]\n**[[Grammatical gender]]\n**[[Grammatical tense]]\n**[[Grammatical aspect]]\n**[[Grammatical mood]]\n**[[Grammatical voice]]\n*[[Non-finite verb|Non-finite verb forms]].\n\nOther factors which may affect conjugation are:\n* Degree of formality (see [[T-V distinction]], [[Honorific speech in Japanese]], [[Korean speech levels]])\n*[[Clusivity|Inclusiveness and exclusiveness in the 1st. person plural]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammatical category)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Valency (linguistics)|Valency]]\n\n==See also==\n\n=== Conjugations by language ===\n*[[:Category:Grammatical conjugation]]\n*[[Indo-European copula]]\n\n=== See also ===\n*[[Agreement (linguistics)]]\n*[[Declension]] (nouns, adjectives, ''etc.'')\n*[[Inflection]]\n*[[Redundancy (linguistics)]]\n*[[Screeve]]\n*[[Strong inflection]]\n*[[Verb]]\n*[[Verb argument]]\n*[[Volition (linguistics)]]\n*[[Weak inflection]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grammatical Conjugation}}\n[[Category:Grammatical conjugation| ]]\n[[Category:Grammatical number]]", "sha1": "26cfrw0ir125oto829qj3a5fldv4p89"}}, {"title": "Gomoku", "ns": "0", "id": "12902", "revision": {"id": "864752816", "parentid": "864608877", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T07:10:07Z", "contributor": {"username": "Wind2323", "id": "13388451"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}\n'''''Gomoku''''', also called ''Five in a Row'', is an [[abstract strategy]] [[board game]]. It is traditionally played with [[Go (game)|Go]] pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board, using 15\u00d715 of the 19\u00d719 grid intersections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-101.com/culture/gomoku_japanese_board_game.htm |title=Gomoku - Japanese Board Game |publisher=Japan 101 |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326000833/http://www.japan-101.com/culture/gomoku_japanese_board_game.htm |archivedate=2014-03-26 |df= }}</ref> Because pieces are not moved or removed from the board, Gomoku may also be played as a [[paper and pencil game]]. The game is known in several countries under different names.\n\nPlayers alternate turns placing a stone of their color on an empty intersection. The winner is the first player to form an unbroken chain of five stones horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n\n==Origin==\nIt originated in Japan during the [[Heian period]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}. The name \"Gomoku\" is from the [[Japanese language]], in which it is referred to as {{nihongo|''gomokunarabe''|\u4e94\u76ee\u4e26\u3079}}. ''Go'' means [[5|five]], ''moku'' is a counter word for [[Go stone|piece]]s and ''narabe'' means ''line-up''. The game is also popular in [[Korea]], where it is called ''omok'' (\uc624\ubaa9 [\u4e94\u76ee]) which has the same structure and origin as the Japanese name.\n\nThe Japanese call this game Go-moku (five stones). In the nineteenth century, the game was introduced to Britain where it was known as '''Go Bang''', said to be a corruption of the Japanese word  ''[[Go board|goban]]'', said to be adopted from Chinese ''k'i pan (q\u00ed p\u00e1n)'' \"go-board.\"<ref>OED citations: '''1886''' GUILLEMARD ''Cruise \u2018Marchesa\u2019'' I. 267 Some of the games are purely Japanese..as ''go-ban''. ''Note'', This game is the one lately introduced into England under the misspelt name of Go Bang. '''1888''' ''Pall Mall Gazette'' 1. Nov. 3/1 These young persons...played go-bang and cat's cradle.\nThe board below shows the three types of winning arrangements as they might appear on an 8x8 Petteia board. Obviously the cramped conditions would result in a draw most of the time, depending on the rules. Play would be easier on a larger Latrunculi board of 12x8 or even 10x11.\n.</ref>\n\n==Official rules==\nBesides many variations around the world, the '''Swap2''' rule (based on \"swap\" from [[Renju]]) is currently adapted in tournaments among professional players, including Gomoku World Championships.\n\nIn Swap2 rule, the first player starts by placing three stones (2 black 1 white, if black goes first) on the board.  The second player next can select one of these three options: choose to play black, or to play white and place one more stone, or to place two more stones to change the shape and let the first player choose the color.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://renju.net/media/showrule.php?rule=11|title=Gomoku - swap2 rule|last=|first=|date=|website=renju.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-09}}</ref><ref>http://gomokuworld.com/gomoku/2</ref> This is essentially a slightly more elaborate [[pie rule]].\n\nSwap2 solved the low complexity problem<ref name=\":0\" /> and makes the game fairer. Like other rules and variations, 100% fairness can be reached by playing two alternating games for each point.\n\n==Variations==\n{{More citations needed|date=August 2007}}\nMost variations are based on either '''Free-style gomoku''' or '''Standard gomoku'''.\n\n* '''Free-style gomoku''' requires a row of five or more stones for a win.\n* '''Standard gomoku''' requires a row of exactly five stones for a win: rows of six or more, called '''overlines''', do not count.\n\n===Optional (\"house\") rules===\nBlack (the player who makes the first move) was long known to have a big advantage, even before L. Victor Allis proved that black could force a win (see below). So a number of variations are played with extra rules that aimed to reduce black's advantage.\n\n* The rule of '''three and three''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two open rows of three stones (rows not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end).\n* The rule of '''four and four''' bans a move that simultaneously forms two rows of four stones (open or not).\n* Alternatively, a handicap may be given such that after the first \"three and three\" play has been made, the opposing player may place two stones as their next turn. These stones must block an opponent's row of three.\n* Efforts to improve fairness by reducing first-move advantage include the rule of '''swap''', generalizable as \"swap-(''x'',''y'',''z'')\" and characterizable as a partially compounded and partially iterated version of the [[pie rule]] (\"one person slices; the other chooses\"):  One player places on the board ''x'' stones of the first-moving color and a lesser number ''y'' stones of the second-moving color (\"slicing\" in the pie metaphor); the other player is entitled to choose between ''a'') playing from the starting position, in which case the selecting player is also entitled to choose which color to play, and ''b'') placing ''z'' (usually [(x - y) + 1]) more stones on the board at locations of that player's choice (\"reslicing\" in the pie metaphor, with limitations created by the board's existing setup akin to limitations arising from the existing slices in the pie), in which case the former player is entitled to choose which color side to play.\n\n===Specific variations===\n* '''[[Renju]]''' is played on a 15\u00d715 board, with the rules of three and three, four and four, and overlines applied to Black only and with opening rules, some of which are following the ''swap'' pattern.\n* In '''Caro''' (also called Gomoku+, popular among Vietnamese), the winner must have an unbroken row of five stones and this row must not be blocked at either end. This rule makes Gomoku more flexible and provides more power for White to defend.\n* '''Omok''' is played the same as Standard Gomoku; however, it is played on a 19\u00d719 board and include the rule of ''three and three''. The '''overlines''' rules, do not count.\n* '''Ninuki-renju''' or '''Wu''' is a variant which adds capturing to the game; it was published in the USA in a slightly simplified form under the name [[Pente]].\n\n===Theoretical generalizations===\n* [[m,n,k-game|''m'',''n'',''k''-games]] are a [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''\u00d7''n'' intersections, and ''k'' in a row needed to win.\n* Connect(''m'',''n'',''k'',''p'',''q'') games are another [[generalized game|generalization]] of gomoku to a board with ''m''\u00d7''n'' intersections, ''k'' in a row needed to win, ''p'' stones for each player to place, and ''q'' stones for the first player to place for the first move only. Each player may play only at the lowest unoccupied place in a column. In particular, Connect(''m'',''n'',6,2,1) is called [[Connect6]].\n\n==Example game==\n[[File:Gomoku-game-1.svg|thumb|300px|right|First game]]\nThis game on the 15\u00d715 board is adapted from the paper \"Go-Moku and Threat-Space Search\".<ref>Allis, L. V., Herik, H. J., & Huntjens, M. P. H. (1993). ''Go-moku and threat-space search''. University of Limburg, Department of Computer Science.</ref>\n\nThe opening moves show clearly black's advantage. An open row of three (one that is not blocked by an opponent's stone at either end) has to be blocked immediately, or countered with a threat elsewhere on the board. If not blocked or countered, the open row of three will be extended to an open row of four, which threatens to win in two ways.\n\nWhite has to block open rows of three at moves 10, 14, 16 and 20, but black only has to do so at move 9.\nMove 20 is a blunder for white (it should have been played next to black 19). Black can now force a win against any defence by white, starting with move 21.\n\n[[File:Gomoku-game-3.svg|thumb|300px|right|Second game (continuation from first game)]]\nThere are two forcing sequences for black, depending on whether white 22 is played next to black 15 or black 21.

Glyphs are considered to be unique marks that collectively add up to the spelling of a word or contribute to a specific meaning of what is written, with that meaning dependent on cultural and social usage.  \n\n==Distinctions==\n\nIn contrast, in most languages written in any variety of the [[Latin alphabet]], the [[Tittle|dot]] on a lower-case ''i'' is not a glyph because it does not convey any distinction, and an ''i'' in which the dot has been accidentally omitted is still likely to be recognized correctly. However, in Turkish it is a glyph because that language has two distinct versions of the letter ''i'', [[Dotted and dotless I|with and without a dot]].  Also, in Japanese [[syllabary|syllabaries]], a number of the characters are made up of more than one separate mark, but in general these separate marks are not glyphs because they have no meaning by themselves. However, in some cases, additional marks fulfill the role of [[diacritic]]s, to differentiate distinct characters. Such additional marks constitute glyphs.  In general, a diacritic is a glyph, even if it is contiguous with the rest of the character like a [[cedilla]] in French, the [[ogonek]] in several languages, or the stroke on a Polish \"[[\u0141]]\".\n\nSome characters such as \"[[\u00e6]]\" in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and the \"[[\u00df]]\" in [[German language|German]] may be regarded as glyphs, yet they were originally [[Typographic ligature|ligature]]s, but over time have become characters in their own right, and these languages treat them as separate letters. However, a ligature such as \"\u017fi\", that is treated in some typefaces as a single unit, is arguably not a glyph as this is just a quirk of the typeface, essentially an [[allograph]]ic feature, and includes more than one [[grapheme]]. In normal handwriting, even long words are often written \"joined up\", without the pen leaving the paper, and the form of each written letter will often vary depending on which letters precede and follow it, but that does not make the whole word into a single glyph.\n\nTwo or more glyphs which have the same significance, whether used interchangeably or chosen depending on context, are called [[allograph]]s of each other.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term has been used in English since 1727, borrowed from ''glyphe'' (in use by French antiquaries since 1701), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03b3\u03bb\u03c5\u03c6\u03ae, ''glyph\u0113'', \"carving,\" and the verb \u03b3\u03bb\u03cd\u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd, ''gl\u00fdphein'', \"to hollow out, engrave, carve\" (cognate with Latin ''glubere'' \"to peel\" and English ''cleave'').{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThe word ''[[hieroglyph]]'' (Greek for sacred writing) has a longer history in English, dating from an early use in an English to Italian dictionary published by [[John Florio]] in 1598, referencing the  complex and mysterious characters of the Egyptian alphabet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/86804#eid1583426|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-21}}</ref>\nThe word ''glyph'' first came to widespread European attention with the engravings and lithographs from [[Frederick Catherwood]]'s drawings of undeciphered glyphs of the [[Maya civilization]] in the early 1840s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ancientscripts.com/maya.html|title=Maya|last=|first=|date=|website=Ancientscripts.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref> \n\n==Graphonomics==\nIn [[graphonomics]], the term glyph is used for a noncharacter, i.e. either a subcharacter or multicharacter pattern. Most typographic glyphs originate from the characters of a [[typeface]]. In a typeface each character typically corresponds to a single glyph, but there are exceptions, such as a font used for a language with a large alphabet or complex writing system, where one character may correspond to several glyphs, or several characters to one glyph.\n\n==Archaeology==\n[[File:MAYA-g-log-cal-D10-Ok.svg|thumb|right|[[Maya script|Mayan glyph]] for Day 10 of the [[tzolkin]] calendar]]\nIn archaeology, a glyph is a carved or inscribed symbol. It may be a [[pictogram]] or [[ideogram]], or part of a [[writing system]] such as a [[syllabary|syllable]], or a [[logogram]].\n\nA glyph is \"the specific shape, design, or representation of a character\".<ref>{{cite web |title= Confusing (and Frequently Misused) Type Terminology, Part 1 |author= Ilene Strizver|date= |work= fonts.com|publisher= Monotype Imaging|accessdate=22 October 2011 }}</ref> It is a particular graphical representation, in a particular [[typeface]], of an element of written language, which could be a grapheme, or part of a grapheme, or sometimes several graphemes in combination (a composed glyph<ref group=\"note\">For example, the sequence ''\u017fi'' contains two characters, but can be represented by one glyph, the two characters being combined into a single unit known as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]].\nConversely, some older models of [[typewriter]]s require the use of multiple glyphs to depict a single character, as an overstruck [[apostrophe]] and [[full stop|period]] to create an [[exclamation mark]].</ref>). If there is more than one allograph of a unit of writing, and the choice between them depends on context or on the preference of the author, they now have to be treated as separate glyphs, because mechanical arrangements have to be available to differentiate between them and to print whichever of them is required. The same is true in [[computing]]. In computing as well as typography, the term \"[[character (computing)|character]]\" refers to a grapheme or grapheme-like unit of text, as found in [[natural language]] [[writing system]]s (''scripts''). In typography and computing, the range of graphemes is broader than in a written language in other ways too: a typographical [[font]] often has to cope with a range of different languages each of which contribute their own graphemes, and it may also be required to print other symbols such as [[dingbat]]s.

The name, goth subculture, derived directly from the music genre. Seminal post-punk and gothic rock artists that helped develop and shape the subculture include [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[The Cure]], [[Joy Division]], and [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]]. The goth subculture has survived much longer than others of the same era, and has continued to diversify and spread throughout the world. Its imagery and cultural proclivities indicate influences from the 19th century [[Gothic literature]] and gothic [[horror film]]s. The scene is centered on music festivals, nightclubs and organized meetings, especially in [[Western Europe]].\n\nThe goth subculture has associated tastes in music, aesthetics, and fashion. The music preferred by the goth subculture includes a number of different styles, e.g. [[gothic rock]], [[death rock]], [[post-punk]], [[synthpop]], [[Cold wave music|cold wave]], [[dark wave]], and [[ethereal wave]].<ref>Nym, Alexander: ''Schillerndes Dunkel.

Frontispiece to 1831 edition shown.]]\n\n[[Gothic literature]] is a genre of fiction that combines romance and dark elements to produce mystery, suspense, terror, horror and the supernatural. According to David H. Richter, settings were framed to take place at \"\u2026ruinous castles, gloomy churchyards, claustrophobic monasteries, and lonely mountain roads\". Typical characters consisted of the cruel parent, sinister priest, courageous victor, and the helpless heroine, along with supernatural figures such as [[demon]]s, [[vampire]]s, [[ghost]]s, and [[monster]]s. Often, the plot focused on characters ill-fated, internally conflicted, and innocently victimized by harassing malicious figures. In addition to the dismal plot focuses, the literary tradition of the gothic was to also focus on individual characters that were gradually going insane.{{sfn|Richter|1987}}\n\nEnglish author [[Horace Walpole]], with his 1764 novel ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'' is one of the first writers who explored this genre.

Clothes are frequently self-designed.\n\nIn recent times, especially in the course of commercialization of parts of the Goth subculture, many non-involved people developed an interest in dark fashion styles and started to adopt elements of Goth clothing (primarily mass-produced goods from malls) without being connected to subcultural basics, e.g. Gothic music and Gothic lifestyle. Within the Goth movement they have been regularly described as ''poseurs'' or ''mallgoths.''<ref>Nancy Kilpatrick. ''Goth Bible: A Compendium for the Darkly Inclined''. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004, p. 24</ref> (see also section ''[[Goth subculture#Identity|Identity]]'').\n\n===Films===\n{{main article|Gothic film}}\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:The Hunger film poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Film poster for ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', a key influence in the early days of the goth subculture{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}]]\nSome of the early gothic rock and deathrock artists adopted traditional horror film images and drew on horror film soundtracks for inspiration. Their audiences responded by adopting appropriate dress and props. Use of standard horror film props like swirling smoke, rubber bats, and cobwebs featured as gothic club d\u00e9cor from the beginning in The Batcave. Such references in bands' music and images were originally [[tongue-in-cheek]], but as time went on, bands and members of the subculture took the connection more seriously. As a result, morbid, [[supernatural]] and [[occult]] themes became more noticeably serious in the subculture. The interconnection between horror and goth was highlighted in its early days by ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', a 1983 vampire film starring [[David Bowie]], [[Catherine Deneuve]] and [[Susan Sarandon]]. The film featured gothic rock group Bauhaus performing ''Bela Lugosi's Dead'' in a nightclub. [[Tim Burton]] created a storybook atmosphere filled with darkness and shadow in some of his films like ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988), ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' (1989), ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' (1990), and the [[stop motion]] films ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' (1993), which was produced/co-written by Burton, and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' (2005), which he co-produced.\n\nAs the subculture became well-established, the connection between goth and horror fiction became almost a clich\u00e9, with goths quite likely to appear as characters in horror novels and film. For example, ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', ''[[The Crow]]'', ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]]'' and ''[[Underworld (film series)|Underworld]]'' film series drew directly on goth music and style. The dark comedies ''[[Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[The Faculty (film)|The Faculty]]'', ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'', ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'' and a few episodes of the animated TV show ''[[South Park]]'' portray or parody the goth subculture. In ''South Park'', several of the fictional schoolchildren are depicted as goths. The goth kids on the show are depicted as finding it annoying to be confused with the [[Hot Topic]] \"[[Vampire lifestyle|vampire]]\" kids from the episode \"[[The Ungroundable]]\" in season 12.<ref>Modell, Josh (2008-11-19). \"The Ungroundable\".

In ''[[The Vampire Chronicles]]'', Rice's characters were depicted as self-tormentors who struggled with alienation, loneliness, and the human condition. Not only did the characters torment themselves, but they also depicted a surreal world that focused on uncovering its splendor. These Chronicles assumed goth attitudes, but they were not intentionally created to represent the gothic subculture. Their romance, beauty, and erotic appeal attracted\nmany goth readers, making her works popular from the 1980s through the 1990s.{{sfn|Jones|2015|pp=179\u2013204}} While Goth has embraced [[Vampire literature]] both in its 19th-century form and in its later incarnations, Rice's [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] take on the vampire mythos has had a \"special resonance\" in the subculture. Her vampire novels feature intense emotions, period clothing, and \"cultured decadence\". Her vampires are [[social alienation|socially alienated]] monsters, but they are also stunningly attractive. Rice's goth readers tend to envision themselves in much the same terms and view characters like [[Lestat de Lioncourt]] as [[role model]]s.{{sfn|Goodlad|Bibby|2007}}\n\n[[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s novel ''[[Native Son]]'' contains gothic imagery and themes that demonstrate the links between blackness and the gothic; themes and images of \"premonitions, curses, prophecies, spells, veils, demonic possessions, graves, skeletons\" are present, suggesting gothic influence.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Smethurst|first=James|date=Spring 2001|title=Invented by Horror: The Gothic and African American Literary Ideology in Native Son|url=https://www.jstor.org.libdatabase.newpaltz.edu/stable/pdf/2903332.pdf?refreqid=search:538c035f1eef07e70b3c55ae25e1110d|journal=African American Review|volume=35|pages=29-30|via=}}</ref> Other classic themes of the gothic are present in the novel, such as transgression and unstable identities of race, class, gender, and nationality. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe re-imagining of the vampire continued with the release of [[Poppy Z.

Despite the fact that Brite's first novel was criticized by some mainstream sources for allegedly \"lack[ing] a moral center: neither terrifyingly malevolent supernatural creatures nor (like Anne Rice's protagonists) tortured souls torn between good and evil, these vampires simply add blood-drinking to the amoral panoply of drug abuse, problem drinking and empty sex practiced by their human counterparts\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-385-30875-5 |title=firction reviews: Lost Souls by Poppy Z.

In the US, events such as [[Bats Day in the Fun Park]] celebrate the culture, as well as the Goth Cruise, and the Gothic Cruise.\n\n=== Interior design ===\nIn the 1980s, goths decorated their walls and ceiling with black fabrics and accessories like rosaries, crosses and plastic roses. Black furniture and cemetery-related objects like candlesticks, death lanterns and skulls.

[s]cene's celebration of active sexuality\" enables goth women \"... to resist mainstream notions of passive femininity\". They have an \"active sexuality\" approach which creates \"gender egalitarianism\" within the scene, as it \"allows them to engage in sexual play with multiple partners while sidestepping most of the stigma and dangers that women who engage in such behavior\" outside the scene frequently incur, while continuing to \"... see themselves as strong\".{{sfn|Wilkins|2004|p=329}}\n\nMen dress up in androgynous way: \"... Men 'gender blend,' wearing makeup and skirts\". In contrast, the \"... women are dressed in sexy feminine outfits\" that are \"... highly sexualized\" and which often combine \"...

[[Androgyny]] is common among the scene: \"... androgyny in Goth subcultural style often disguises or even functions to reinforce conventional gender roles\".

A GWP is calculated over a specific time interval, commonly 20, 100, or 500 years. GWP is expressed as a factor of carbon dioxide (whose GWP is standardized to 1).

The dependence of GWP on the wavelength of absorption is more complicated. Even if a gas absorbs radiation efficiently at a certain wavelength, this may not affect its GWP much if the atmosphere already absorbs most radiation at that wavelength. A gas has the most effect if it absorbs in a \"window\" of wavelengths where the atmosphere is fairly transparent.

GWP is based on a number of factors, including the radiative efficiency (infrared-absorbing ability) of each gas relative to that of carbon dioxide, as well as the decay rate of each gas (the amount removed from the atmosphere over a given number of years) relative to that of carbon dioxide.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.eia.gov/tools/glossary/index.cfm?id=G \n|title=Glossary: Global warming potential (GWP) \n|publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration \n|accessdate=2011-04-26\n|quote=An index used to compare the relative radiative forcing of different gases without directly calculating the changes in atmospheric concentrations. GWPs are calculated as the ratio of the radiative forcing that would result from the emission of one kilogram of a greenhouse gas to that from the emission of one kilogram of carbon dioxide over a fixed period of time, such as 100 years. }}</ref>\n\nThe '''radiative forcing capacity''' (RF) is the amount of energy per unit area, per unit time, absorbed by the greenhouse gas, that would otherwise be lost to space.  It can be expressed by the formula:\n\n:<math>RF = \\sum_{n=1}^{100} Abs_i \\cdot F_i / (path length \\cdot density)</math>\n\nwhere the subscript ''i'' represents an interval of 10 [[inverse centimeter]]s.  Abs<sub>i</sub> represents the integrated infrared absorbance of the sample in that interval, and F<sub>i</sub> represents the RF for that interval.{{Verify source|date=September 2008}}\n\nThe [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) provides the generally accepted values for GWP, which changed slightly between 1996 and 2001. An exact definition of how GWP is calculated is to be found in the IPCC's [https://web.archive.org/web/20160131050350/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/247.htm 2001 Third Assessment Report]. The GWP is defined as the ratio of the time-integrated radiative forcing from the instantaneous release of 1&nbsp;kg of a trace substance relative to that of 1&nbsp;kg of a reference gas:\n\n:<math>GWP \\left(x\\right) = \\frac{\\int_0^{TH} a_x \\cdot \\left[x(t)\\right] dt} {\\int_0^{TH} a_r \\cdot \\left[r(t)\\right] dt}</math>\n\nwhere TH is the time horizon over which the calculation is considered; a<sub>x</sub> is the [[radiative efficiency]] due to a unit increase in atmospheric abundance of the substance (i.e., Wm<sup>\u22122</sup> kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) and [x(t)] is the time-dependent decay in abundance of the substance following an instantaneous release of it at time t=0. The denominator contains the corresponding quantities for the reference gas (i.e. {{CO2|link=yes}}). The radiative efficiencies a<sub>x</sub> and a<sub>r</sub> are not necessarily constant over time. While the absorption of infrared radiation by many greenhouse gases varies linearly with their abundance, a few important ones display non-linear behaviour for current and likely future abundances (e.g., CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and N<sub>2</sub>O). For those gases, the relative radiative forcing will depend upon abundance and hence upon the future scenario adopted.\n\nSince all GWP calculations are a comparison to CO<sub>2</sub> which is non-linear, all GWP values are affected. Assuming otherwise as is done above will lead to lower GWPs for other gases than a more detailed approach would. Clarifying this, while increasing CO<sub>2</sub> has less and less effect on radiative absorption as ppm concentrations rise, more powerful greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide have different thermal absorption frequencies to CO<sub>2</sub> that are not filled up (saturated) as much as CO<sub>2</sub>, so rising ppms of these gases are far more significant.\n\n=== Use in Kyoto Protocol ===\nUnder the [[Kyoto Protocol]], the Conference of the Parties decided (decision 2/CP.3) that the values of GWP calculated for the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report]] are to be used for converting the various greenhouse gas emissions into comparable [[Co2e|CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents]] when computing overall sources and sinks.<ref>{{cite book\n|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/cop3/07a01.pdf \n|contribution=Methodological issues related to the Kyoto Protocol\n|title=Report of the Conference of the Parties on its third session, held at Kyoto from 1 to 11 December 1997 Addendum Part Two:  Action taken by the Conference of the Parties at its third session \n|date=25 March 1998 |accessdate=17 January 2011\n|publisher=[[UNFCCC]] \n|author=Conference of the Parties }}</ref>\n<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/earthatmosphericaquatic/docview/198550594/4EF4866BD8C54EB7PQ/1?accountid=10267 \"Testing 100-year global warming potentials: Impacts on compliance costs and abatement profile\"], \"Climatic Change\" Retrieved March 16, 2018</ref>\n\n== Global Temperature change Potential (GTP) ==\nThe ''Global Temperature change Potential'' is another way to quantify the ratio change from a substance relative to that of CO<sub>2</sub>, in global mean surface temperature, used for a specific time span.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FINAL.pdf|title=IPCC AR5 - Anthropogenic and Natural Radiative Forcing (Chapter 8 / page 663)|date=2013}}</ref>\n\n== Importance of time horizon ==\nA substance's GWP depends on the timespan over which the potential is calculated. A gas which is quickly removed from the atmosphere may initially have a large effect, but for longer time periods, as it has been removed, it becomes less important. Thus methane has a potential of 34 over 100 years but 86 over 20 years; conversely [[sulfur hexafluoride]] has a GWP of 22,800 over 100 years but 16,300 over 20 years ([[IPCC Third Assessment Report]]). The GWP value depends on how the gas concentration decays over time in the atmosphere. This is often not precisely known and hence the values should not be considered exact. For this reason when quoting a GWP it is important to give a reference to the calculation.\n\nThe GWP for a mixture of gases can be obtained from the mass-fraction-weighted average of the GWPs of the individual gases.<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=uriserv:OJ.L_.2014.150.01.0195.01.ENG Regulation (EU) No 517/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases] Annex IV.</ref>\n\nCommonly, a time horizon of 100 years is used by regulators (e.g., the [[California Air Resources Board]]).\n\n== Values ==\n[[Carbon dioxide]] has a GWP of exactly 1 (since it is the baseline unit to which all other greenhouse gases are compared).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |GWP values and lifetimes from 2013 IPCC AR5 p714 <br> (with climate-carbon feedbacks)<ref>Myhre, G., D.

A category together with a choice of Grothendieck topology is called a '''site'''.\n\nGrothendieck topologies axiomatize the notion of an [[open cover]].  Using the notion of covering provided by a Grothendieck topology, it becomes possible to define [[Sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] on a category and their [[cohomology]].  This was first done in [[algebraic geometry]] and [[algebraic number theory]] by [[Alexander Grothendieck]] to define the [[\u00e9tale cohomology]] of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]].  It has been used to define other cohomology theories since then, such as [[l-adic cohomology]], [[flat cohomology]], and [[crystalline cohomology]]. While Grothendieck topologies are most often used to define cohomology theories, they have found other applications as well, such as to [[John Tate]]'s theory of [[rigid analytic geometry]].\n\nThere is a natural way to associate a site to an ordinary [[topological space]], and Grothendieck's theory is loosely regarded as a generalization of classical topology.  Under meager point-set hypotheses, namely [[sober space|sobriety]], this is completely accurate&mdash;it is possible to recover a sober space from its associated site.  However simple examples such as the [[indiscrete topology|indiscrete topological space]] show that not all topological spaces can be expressed using Grothendieck topologies.  Conversely, there are Grothendieck topologies which do not come from topological spaces.\n\nThe term \"Grothendieck topology\" has changed in meaning. In {{harvtxt|Artin|1962}} it meant what is now called a Grothendieck pretopology, and some authors still use this old meaning. {{harvtxt|Giraud|1964}} modified the definition to use sieves rather than covers. Much of the time this does not make much difference, as each Grothendieck pretopology determines a unique Grothendieck topology, though quite different pretopologies can give the same topology.\n\n== Overview ==\n{{main|History of topos theory}}\n[[Andr\u00e9 Weil]]'s famous [[Weil conjectures]] proposed that certain properties of equations with integral coefficients should be understood as geometric properties of the [[algebraic variety]] that they define.  His conjectures postulated that there should be a [[cohomology]] theory of algebraic varieties which gave number-theoretic information about their defining equations.  This cohomology theory was known as the \"Weil  cohomology\", but using the tools he had available, Weil was unable to construct it.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Alexander Grothendieck introduced [[\u00e9tale map]]s into algebraic geometry as algebraic analogues of local analytic isomorphisms in [[analytic geometry]].  He used \u00e9tale coverings to define an algebraic analogue of the [[fundamental group]] of a topological space.  Soon [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] noticed that some properties of \u00e9tale coverings mimicked those of [[open immersion]]s, and that consequently it was possible to make constructions which imitated the [[cohomology|cohomology functor]] ''H''<sup>1</sup>.  Grothendieck saw that it would be possible to use Serre's idea to define a cohomology theory which he suspected would be the Weil cohomology.  To define this cohomology theory, Grothendieck needed to replace the usual, topological notion of an open covering with one that would use \u00e9tale coverings instead.  Grothendieck also saw how to phrase the definition of covering abstractly; this is where the definition of a Grothendieck topology comes from.\n\n== Definition ==\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe classical definition of a sheaf begins with a topological space ''X''.  A sheaf associates information to the open sets of ''X''.  This information can be phrased abstractly by letting ''O''(''X'') be the category whose objects are the open subsets ''U'' of ''X'' and whose morphisms are the inclusion maps ''V'' \u2192 ''U'' of open sets ''U'' and ''V'' of ''X''.  We will call such maps ''open immersions'', just as in the context of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s.  Then a presheaf on ''X'' is a [[contravariant functor]] from ''O''(''X'') to the category of sets, and a sheaf is a presheaf which satisfies the [[gluing axiom]].  The gluing axiom is phrased in terms of [[Cover (topology)|pointwise covering]], i.e., <math>\\{U_i\\}</math> covers ''U'' if and only if <math> \\bigcup_i U_i = U</math>. In this definition, <math>U_i</math> is an open subset of ''X''. Grothendieck topologies replace each <math>U_i</math> with an entire family of open subsets; in this example, <math>U_i</math> is replaced by the family of all open immersions <math>V_{ij} \\to U_i</math>. Such a collection is called a ''sieve''. Pointwise covering is replaced by the notion of a ''covering family''; in the above example, the set of all <math>\\{V_{ij}  \\to U_i\\}_j</math> as ''i'' varies is a covering family of ''U''. Sieves and covering families can be axiomatized, and once this is done open sets and pointwise covering can be replaced by other notions which describe other properties of the space ''X''.\n\n=== Sieves ===\nIn a Grothendieck topology, the notion of a collection of open subsets of ''U'' stable under inclusion is replaced by the notion of a [[sieve (category theory)|sieve]].  If ''c'' is any given object in ''C'', a '''sieve''' on ''c'' is a [[subfunctor]] of the functor Hom(&minus;, ''c''); (this is the [[Yoneda embedding]] applied to ''c'').  In the case of ''O''(''X''), a sieve ''S'' on an open set ''U'' selects a collection of open subsets of ''U'' which is stable under inclusion.  More precisely, consider that for any open subset ''V'' of ''U'', ''S''(''V'') will be a subset of Hom(''V'', ''U''), which has only one element, the open immersion ''V'' \u2192 ''U''.  Then ''V'' will be considered \"selected\" by ''S'' if and only if ''S''(''V'') is nonempty. If ''W'' is a subset of ''V'', then there is a morphism ''S''(''V'') \u2192 ''S''(''W'') given by composition with the inclusion ''W'' \u2192 ''V''.  If ''S''(''V'') is non-empty, it follows that ''S''(''W'') is also non-empty.\n\nIf ''S'' is a sieve on ''X'', and ''f'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' is a morphism, then left composition by ''f'' gives a sieve on ''Y'' called the '''[[pullback]] of''' ''S'' '''along''' ''f'', denoted by ''f''<sup><math>^\\ast</math></sup>''S''.  It is defined as the [[fibered product]] ''S''&nbsp;&times;<sub>Hom(&minus;, ''X'')</sub>&nbsp;Hom(&minus;, ''Y'') together with its natural embedding in Hom(&minus;, ''Y'').  More concretely, for each object ''Z'' of ''C'', ''f''<sup><math>^\\ast</math></sup>''S''(''Z'') = { ''g'': ''Z'' \u2192 ''Y'' | ''fg'' <math>\\in</math>''S''(''Z'') }, and ''f''<sup><math>^\\ast</math></sup>''S'' inherits its action on morphisms by being a subfunctor of Hom(&minus;, ''Y'').  In the classical example, the pullback of a collection {''V''<sub>i</sub>} of subsets of ''U'' along an inclusion ''W'' \u2192 ''U'' is the collection {''V''<sub>i</sub>\u2229W}.\n\n=== Grothendieck topology ===\nA '''Grothendieck topology''' ''J'' on a category ''C'' is a collection, ''for each object c of C'', of distinguished sieves on ''c'', denoted by ''J''(''c'') and called '''covering sieves''' of ''c''.  This selection will be subject to certain axioms, stated below.   Continuing the previous example, a sieve ''S'' on an open set ''U'' in ''O''(''X'') will be a covering sieve if and only if the union of all the open sets ''V'' for which ''S''(''V'') is nonempty equals ''U''; in other words, if and only if ''S'' gives us a collection of open sets which [[Cover (topology)|cover]] ''U'' in the classical sense.\n\n==== Axioms ====\nThe conditions we impose on a Grothendieck topology are:\n\n* (T 1) (Base change) If ''S'' is a covering sieve on ''X'', and ''f'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' is a morphism, then the pullback ''f''<sup><math>^\\ast</math></sup>''S'' is a covering sieve on ''Y''.\n* (T 2) (Local character)  Let ''S'' be a covering sieve on ''X'', and let ''T'' be any sieve on ''X''.  Suppose that for each object ''Y'' of ''C'' and each arrow ''f'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' in ''S''(''Y''), the pullback sieve ''f''<sup><math>^\\ast</math></sup>''T'' is a covering sieve on ''Y''.  Then ''T'' is a covering sieve on ''X''.\n* (T 3) (Identity) Hom(&minus;, ''X'') is a covering sieve on ''X'' for any object ''X'' in ''C''.\n\nThe base change axiom corresponds to the idea that if {<math>U_i</math>}  covers ''U'', then {''U<sub>i</sub>'' \u2229 ''V''} should cover ''U'' \u2229 ''V''.  The local character axiom corresponds to the idea that if {''U<sub>i</sub>''} covers ''U'' and {''V<sub>ij</sub>''}<sub>''j <math>\\in</math>J<sub>i</sub>''</sub> covers ''U<sub>i</sub>'' for each ''i'', then the collection {''V<sub>ij</sub>''} for all ''i'' and ''j'' should cover ''U''.  Lastly, the identity axiom corresponds to the idea that any set is covered by all its possible subsets.\n\n==== Grothendieck pretopologies ====\nIn fact, it is possible to put these axioms in another form where their geometric character is more apparent, assuming that the underlying category ''C'' contains certain fibered products. In this case, instead of specifying sieves, we can specify that certain collections of maps with a common codomain should cover their codomain.  These collections are called '''covering families'''.  If the collection of all covering families satisfies certain axioms, then we say that they form a '''Grothendieck pretopology'''.  These axioms are:\n\n* (PT 0) (Existence of fibered products) For all objects ''X'' of ''C'', and for all morphisms ''X''<sub>0</sub> \u2192 ''X'' which appear in some covering family of ''X'', and for all morphisms ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'', the fibered product ''X''<sub>0</sub>&nbsp;&times;<sub>''X''</sub>&nbsp;''Y'' exists.\n* (PT 1) (Stability under base change) For all objects ''X'' of ''C'', all morphisms ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'', and all covering families {''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''}, the family {''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> &times;<sub>''X''</sub> ''Y'' \u2192 ''Y''} is a covering family.\n* (PT 2) (Local character) If {''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''} is a covering family, and if for all \u03b1, {''X''<sub>\u03b2\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub>} is a covering family, then the family of composites {''X''<sub>\u03b2\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''} is a covering family.\n* (PT 3) (Isomorphisms) If ''f'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' is an isomorphism, then {''f''} is a covering family.\n\nFor any pretopology, the collection of all sieves that contain a covering family from the pretopology is always a Grothendieck topology.\n\nFor categories with fibered products, there is a converse.  Given a collection of arrows {''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''}, we construct a sieve ''S'' by letting ''S''(''Y'') be the set of all morphisms ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' that factor through some arrow ''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''.  This is called the sieve '''generated by''' {''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''}.  Now choose a topology.  Say that {''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''} is a covering family if and only if the sieve that it generates is a covering sieve for the given topology.  It is easy to check that this defines a pretopology.\n\n(PT 3) is sometimes replaced by a weaker axiom:\n\n* (PT 3') (Identity) If ''1''<sub>''X''</sub> : ''X'' \u2192 ''X'' is the identity arrow, then {''1''<sub>''X''</sub>} is a covering family.\n\n(PT 3) implies (PT 3'), but not conversely.  However, suppose that we have a collection of covering families that satisfies (PT 0) through (PT 2) and (PT 3'), but not (PT 3).  These families generate a pretopology.  The topology generated by the original collection of covering families is then the same as the topology generated by the pretopology, because the sieve generated by an isomorphism ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' is Hom(&minus;, ''X'').  Consequently, if we restrict our attention to topologies, (PT 3) and (PT 3') are equivalent.\n\n== Sites and sheaves ==\n{{see also|Topos}}\n\nLet ''C'' be a category and let ''J'' be a Grothendieck topology on ''C''.  The pair (''C'', ''J'') is called a '''site'''.\n\nA '''[[presheaf (category theory)|presheaf]]''' on a category is a contravariant functor from ''C'' to the category of all sets.  Note that for this definition ''C'' is not required to have a topology.  A sheaf on a site, however, should allow gluing, just like sheaves in classical topology.  Consequently, we define a '''sheaf''' on a site to be a presheaf ''F'' such that for all objects ''X'' and all covering sieves ''S'' on ''X'', the natural map Hom(Hom(&minus;, ''X''), ''F'') \u2192 Hom(''S'', ''F''), induced by the inclusion of ''S'' into Hom(&minus;, ''X''), is a bijection.  Halfway in between a presheaf and a sheaf is the notion of a '''separated presheaf''', where the natural map above is required to be only an injection, not a bijection, for all sieves ''S''.  A '''morphism''' of presheaves or of sheaves is a natural transformation of functors.  The category of all sheaves on ''C'' is the '''topos''' defined by the site (''C'', ''J'').\n\nUsing the [[Yoneda lemma]], it is possible to show that a presheaf on the category ''O''(''X'') is a sheaf on the topology defined above if and only if it is a sheaf in the classical sense.\n\nSheaves on a pretopology have a particularly simple description: For each covering family {''X''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''}, the diagram\n\n:<math>F(X) \\rightarrow \\prod_{\\alpha\\in A} F(X_\\alpha) {{{} \\atop \\longrightarrow}\\atop{\\longrightarrow \\atop {}}} \\prod_{\\alpha,\\beta \\in A} F(X_\\alpha\\times_X X_\\beta)</math>\n\nmust be an [[equalizer (mathematics)|equalizer]].  For a separated presheaf, the first arrow need only be injective.\n\nSimilarly, one can define presheaves and sheaves of [[abelian group]]s, [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]s, [[module (mathematics)|module]]s, and so on.  One can require either that a presheaf ''F'' is a contravariant functor to the category of abelian groups (or rings, or modules, etc.), or that ''F'' be an abelian group (ring, module, etc.) object in the category of all contravariant functors from ''C'' to the category of sets.  These two definitions are equivalent.\n\n== Examples of sites ==\n\n=== The discrete and indiscrete topologies ===\n\nLet '''C''' be any category.  To define the '''discrete topology''', we declare all sieves to be covering sieves.  If '''C''' has all fibered products, this is equivalent to declaring all families to be covering families.  To define the '''indiscrete topology''', we declare only the sieves of the form Hom(&minus;, ''X'') to be covering sieves.  The indiscrete topology is also known as the '''biggest''' or '''chaotic''' topology, and it is generated by the pretopology which has only isomorphisms for covering families.  A sheaf on the indiscrete site is the same thing as a presheaf.\n\n=== The canonical topology ===\n\nLet '''C''' be any category.  The Yoneda embedding gives a functor Hom(&minus;, ''X'') for each object ''X'' of '''C'''.  The '''canonical topology''' is the biggest (finest) topology such that every representable presheaf, i.e. presheaf of the form Hom(&minus;, ''X''), is a sheaf.  A covering sieve or covering family for this site is said to be ''strictly universally epimorphic''.  A topology which is less fine than the canonical topology, that is, for which every covering sieve is strictly universally epimorphic, is called '''subcanonical'''.  Subcanonical sites are exactly the sites for which every presheaf of the form Hom(&minus;, ''X'') is a sheaf.  Most sites encountered in practice are subcanonical.\n\n=== Small site associated to a topological space ===\n\nWe repeat the example which we began with above.  Let ''X'' be a topological space.  We defined ''O''(''X'') to be the category whose objects are the open sets of ''X'' and whose morphisms are inclusions of open sets.  Note that for an open set ''U'' and a sieve ''S'' on ''U'', the set ''S''(''V'') contains either zero or one element for every open set ''V''. The covering sieves on an object ''U'' of ''O''(''X'') are those sieves ''S'' satisfying the following condition:\n*If ''W'' is the union of all the sets ''V'' such that ''S''(''V'') is non-empty, then ''W'' = ''U''.\nThis notion of cover matches the usual notion in point-set topology. \n\nThis topology can also naturally be expressed as a pretopology.  We say that a family of inclusions {''V''<sub>\u03b1</sub> <math>\\sube</math> ''U''} is a covering family if and only if the union  <math>\\cup</math>''V''<sub>\u03b1</sub> equals ''U''.  This site is called the '''small site associated to a topological space ''X''.\n\n=== Big site associated to a topological space ===\n\nLet ''Spc'' be the category of all topological spaces.  Given any family of functions {''u''<sub>\u03b1</sub> : ''V''<sub>\u03b1</sub> \u2192 ''X''}, we say that it is a '''surjective family''' or that the morphisms ''u''<sub>\u03b1</sub> are '''jointly surjective''' if  <math>\\cup</math> ''u''<sub>\u03b1</sub>(''V''<sub>\u03b1</sub>) equals ''X''.  We define a pretopology on ''Spc'' by taking the covering families to be surjective families all of whose members are open immersions.  Let ''S'' be a sieve on ''Spc''.  ''S'' is a covering sieve for this topology if and only if:\n*For all ''Y'' and every morphism ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' in ''S''(''Y''), there exists a ''V'' and a ''g'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''X'' such that ''g'' is an open immersion, ''g'' is in ''S''(''V''), and ''f'' factors through ''g''.\n*If ''W'' is the union of all the sets ''f''(''Y''), where ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' is in ''S''(''Y''), then ''W'' = ''X''.\n\nFix a topological space ''X''.  Consider the [[comma category]] ''Spc/X'' of topological spaces with a fixed continuous map to ''X''.  The topology on ''Spc'' induces a topology on ''Spc/X''.  The covering sieves and covering families are almost exactly the same; the only difference is that now all the maps involved commute with the fixed maps to ''X''.  This is the '''big site associated to a topological space '''''X''''' '''.  Notice that ''Spc'' is the big site associated to the one point space.  This site was first considered by [[Jean Giraud (mathematician)|Jean Giraud]].\n\n=== The big and small sites of a manifold ===\n\nLet ''M'' be a [[manifold]].  ''M'' has a category of open sets ''O''(''M'') because it is a topological space, and it gets a topology as in the above example.  For two open sets ''U'' and ''V'' of ''M'', the fiber product ''U'' &times;<sub>''M''</sub> ''V'' is the open set ''U'' \u2229 ''V'', which is still in ''O''(''M'').  This means that the topology on ''O''(''M'') is defined by a pretopology, the same pretopology as before.\n\nLet ''Mfd'' be the category of all manifolds and continuous maps.  (Or smooth manifolds and smooth maps, or real analytic manifolds and analytic maps, etc.) ''Mfd'' is a subcategory of ''Spc'', and open immersions are continuous (or smooth, or analytic, etc.), so ''Mfd'' inherits a topology from ''Spc''.  This lets us construct the big site of the manifold ''M'' as the site ''Mfd/M''.  We can also define this topology using the same pretopology we used above.  Notice that to satisfy (PT 0), we need to check that for any continuous map of manifolds ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' and any open subset ''U'' of ''Y'', the fibered product ''U'' &times;<sub>''Y''</sub> ''X'' is in ''Mfd/M''.  This is just the statement that the preimage of an open set is open.  Notice, however, that not all fibered products exist in ''Mfd'' because the preimage of a smooth map at a critical value need not be a manifold.\n\n=== Topologies on the category of schemes ===\n{{see also|List of topologies on the category of schemes}}\nThe category of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s, denoted ''Sch'', has a tremendous number of useful topologies.  A complete understanding of some questions may require examining a scheme using several different topologies.  All of these topologies have associated small and big sites.  The big site is formed by taking the entire category of schemes and their morphisms, together with the covering sieves specified by the topology.  The small site over a given scheme is formed by only taking the objects and morphisms which are part of a cover of the given scheme.\n\nThe most elementary of these is the [[Zariski topology]].  Let ''X'' be a scheme.  ''X'' has an underlying topological space, and this topological space determines a Grothendieck topology.  The Zariski topology on ''Sch'' is generated by the pretopology whose covering families are jointly surjective families of scheme-theoretic open immersions.  The covering sieves ''S'' for ''Zar'' are characterized by the following two properties:\n*For all ''Y'' and every morphism ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' in ''S''(''Y''), there exists a ''V'' and a ''g'' : ''V'' \u2192 ''X'' such that ''g'' is an open immersion, ''g'' is in ''S''(''V''), and ''f'' factors through ''g''.\n*If ''W'' is the union of all the sets ''f''(''Y''), where ''f'' : ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' is in ''S''(''Y''), then ''W'' = ''X''.\nDespite their outward similarities, the topology on ''Zar'' is ''not'' the restriction of the topology on ''Spc''!  This is because there are morphisms of schemes which are topologically open immersions but which are not scheme-theoretic open immersions.  For example, let ''A'' be a non-[[reduced (ring theory)|reduced]] ring and let ''N'' be its ideal of nilpotents.  The quotient map ''A'' \u2192 ''A/N'' induces a map Spec ''A/N'' \u2192 Spec ''A'' which is the identity on underlying topological spaces.  To be a scheme-theoretic open immersion it must also induce an isomorphism on structure sheaves, which this map does not do.  In fact, this map is a closed immersion.\n\nThe [[\u00e9tale topology]] is finer than the Zariski topology.  It was the first Grothendieck topology to be closely studied.  Its covering families are jointly surjective families of \u00e9tale morphisms.  It is finer than the Nisnevich topology, but neither finer nor coarser than the ''cdh'' and l&prime; topologies.\n\nThere are two [[flat topology|flat topologies]], the ''fppf'' topology and the ''fpqc'' topology.  ''fppf'' stands for ''{{lang|fr|fid\u00e8lement plate de pr\u00e9sentation finie}}'', and in this topology, a morphism of affine schemes is a covering morphism if it is faithfully flat, of finite presentation, and is quasi-finite.  ''fpqc'' stands for ''{{lang|fr|fid\u00e8lement plate et quasi-compacte}}'', and in this topology, a morphism of affine schemes is a covering morphism if it is faithfully flat.  In both categories, a covering family is defined to be a family that is a cover on Zariski open subsets.<ref>SGA III<sub>1</sub>, IV 6.3.</ref>  In the fpqc topology, any faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism is a cover.<ref>SGA III<sub>1</sub>, IV 6.3, Proposition 6.3.1(v).</ref>  These topologies are closely related to [[descent (category theory)|descent]].  The ''fpqc'' topology is finer than all the topologies mentioned above, and it is very close to the canonical topology.\n\nGrothendieck introduced [[crystalline cohomology]] to study the ''p''-torsion part of the cohomology of characteristic ''p'' varieties.  In the ''crystalline topology'' which is the basis of this theory, the underlying category has objects given by infinitesimal thickenings together with [[divided power structure]]s.  Crystalline sites are examples of sites with no final object.\n\n== Continuous and cocontinuous functors ==\nThere are two natural types of functors between sites.  They are given by functors which are compatible with the topology in a certain sense.\n\n=== Continuous functors ===\nIf (''C'', ''J'') and (''D'', ''K'') are sites and ''u'' : ''C'' \u2192 ''D'' is a functor, then ''u'' is '''continuous''' if for every sheaf ''F'' on ''D'' with respect to the topology ''K'', the presheaf ''Fu'' is a sheaf with respect to the topology ''J''. Continuous functors induce functors between the corresponding topoi by sending a sheaf ''F'' to ''Fu''.  These functors are called '''pushforwards'''.  If <math>\\tilde C</math> and <math>\\tilde D</math> denote the topoi associated to ''C'' and ''D'', then the pushforward functor is <math>u_s : \\tilde D \\to \\tilde C</math>.\n\n''u''<sub>''s''</sub> admits a left adjoint ''u''<sup>''s''</sup> called the '''pullback'''. ''u''<sup>''s''</sup> need not preserve limits, even finite limits.\n\nIn the same way, ''u'' sends a sieve on an object ''X'' of ''C'' to a sieve on the object ''uX'' of ''D''.  A continuous functor sends covering sieves to covering sieves.  If ''J'' is the topology defined by a pretopology, and if ''u'' commutes with fibered products, then ''u'' is continuous if and only if it sends covering sieves to covering sieves and if and only if it sends covering families to covering families.  In general, it is ''not'' sufficient for ''u'' to send covering sieves to covering sieves (see SGA IV 3, {{lang|fr|Exemple}} 1.9.3).\n\n=== Cocontinuous functors ===\nAgain, let (''C'', ''J'') and (''D'', ''K'') be sites and ''v'' : ''C'' \u2192 ''D'' be a functor.  If ''X'' is an object of ''C'' and ''R'' is a sieve on ''vX'', then ''R'' can be pulled back to a sieve ''S'' as follows: A morphism ''f'' : ''Z'' \u2192 ''X'' is in ''S'' if and only if ''v''(''f'') : ''vZ'' \u2192 ''vX'' is in ''R''.  This defines a sieve.  ''v'' is '''cocontinuous''' if and only if for every object ''X'' of ''C'' and every covering sieve ''R'' of ''vX'', the pullback ''S'' of ''R'' is a covering sieve on ''X''.\n\nComposition with ''v'' sends a presheaf ''F'' on ''D'' to a presheaf ''Fv'' on ''C'', but if ''v'' is cocontinuous, this need not send sheaves to sheaves.  However, this functor on presheaf categories, usually denoted <math>\\hat v^*</math>, admits a right adjoint <math>\\hat v_*</math>.  Then ''v'' is cocontinuous if and only if <math>\\hat v_*</math> sends sheaves to sheaves, that is, if and only if it restricts to a functor <math>v_* : \\tilde C \\to \\tilde D</math>.  In this case, the composite of <math>\\hat v^*</math> with the associated sheaf functor is a left adjoint of ''v''<sub>*</sub> denoted ''v''<sup>*</sup>. Furthermore, ''v''<sup>*</sup> preserves finite limits, so the adjoint functors ''v''<sub>*</sub> and ''v''<sup>*</sup> determine a [[geometric morphism]] of topoi <math>\\tilde C \\to \\tilde D</math>.\n\n=== Morphisms of sites ===\nA continuous functor ''u'' : ''C'' \u2192 ''D'' is a '''morphism of sites''' ''D'' \u2192 ''C'' (''not'' ''C'' \u2192 ''D'') if ''u''<sup>''s''</sup> preserves finite limits.  In this case, ''u''<sup>''s''</sup> and ''u''<sub>''s''</sub> determine a geometric morphism of topoi <math>\\tilde C \\to \\tilde D</math>. The reasoning behind the convention that a continuous functor ''C'' \u2192 ''D'' is said to determine a morphism of sites in the opposite direction is that this agrees with the intuition coming from the case of topological spaces.  A continuous map of topological spaces ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' determines a continuous functor ''O''(''Y'') \u2192 ''O''(''X'').  Since the original map on topological spaces is said to send ''X'' to ''Y'', the morphism of sites is said to as well.\n\nA particular case of this happens when a continuous functor admits a left adjoint. Suppose that ''u'' : ''C'' \u2192 ''D'' and ''v'' : ''D'' \u2192 ''C'' are functors with ''u'' right adjoint to ''v''. Then ''u'' is continuous if and only if ''v'' is cocontinuous, and when this happens, ''u''<sup>''s''</sup> is naturally isomorphic to ''v''<sup>*</sup> and ''u''<sub>''s''</sub> is naturally isomorphic to ''v''<sub>*</sub>.  In particular, ''u'' is a morphism of sites.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Fibered category]]\n*[[Lawvere\u2013Tierney topology]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{Cite book | last1=Artin | first1=Michael | author1-link=Michael Artin | title=Grothendieck topologies | publisher=Harvard University, Dept. of Mathematics | year=1962 | zbl=0208.48701 | location=Cambridge, MA }}\n*{{cite book\n | editor1-last = Demazure | editor1-first = Michel | editor1-link = Michel Demazure\n | editor2-last=Grothendieck | editor2-first=Alexandre | editor2-link=Alexandre Grothendieck\n | title = S\u00e9minaire de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique du Bois Marie - 1962-64 - Sch\u00e9mas en groupes - (SGA 3) - vol. 1 \n | series=Lecture notes in mathematics | volume=151\n | year = 1970 \n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]\n | location = Berlin; New York\n | language = French\n | pages = xv+564 | zbl=0212.52810\n}}\n*{{cite book\n | first = Michael\n | last = Artin\n | authorlink = Michael Artin |editor=[[Alexandre Grothendieck]] |editor2=[[Jean-Louis Verdier]]\n | title = S\u00e9minaire de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie Alg\u00e9brique du Bois Marie - 1963-64 - Th\u00e9orie des topos et cohomologie \u00e9tale des sch\u00e9mas - (SGA 4) - vol. 1 (Lecture notes in mathematics '''269''')\n | year = 1972\n | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]]\n | location = Berlin; New York\n | language = French\n | pages = xix+525\n | nopp = true\n}}\n*{{citation|mr=0193122 \n|last=Giraud|first= Jean\n|chapter=Analysis situs|year=1964 |title=S\u00e9minaire Bourbaki, 1962/63.

The manga, first serialized in 1989 under the subtitle of ''The Ghost in the Shell'', and later published as its own [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes by [[Kodansha]], told the story of the fictional counter-cyberterrorist organization [[Public Security Section 9]], led by protagonist Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]], in the mid-21st century of Japan.\n\nAnimation studio [[Production I.G]] has produced several different anime adaptations of ''Ghost in the Shell'', starting with the [[Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|1995 film of the same name]], telling the story of Section 9's investigation of the [[Puppet Master (Ghost in the Shell)|Puppet Master]]. The television series ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' followed in 2002, telling an alternate story from the manga and first film, featuring Section 9's investigations of government corruption in the [[Laughing Man (Ghost in the Shell)|Laughing Man]] and [[Individual Eleven]] incidents. A sequel to the 1995 film, ''[[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence]]'', was released in 2004. In 2006, the film ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society]]'' retook the story of the television series. 2013 saw the start of the ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Arise]]'' [[original video animation]] (OVA) series, consisting of four parts through mid-2014. The series was recompiled in early 2015 as a television series titled ''Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture'', airing with an additional two episodes (one part).<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghost in the Shell: Arise's Broadcast to Add 2 New Episodes|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2015-02-17/ghost-in-the-shell-arise-broadcast-to-add-2-new-episodes/.85069|website=Anime News Network|accessdate=17 February 2015}}</ref> An animated feature film produced by most of the ''Arise'' staff, titled ''[[Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie]]'', was released on June 20, 2015.

He had chosen \"Ghost in the Shell\" in homage to [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Ghost in the Machine]]'', from which he also drew inspiration.<ref>\"''Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex'' Official Log 1\", p. 9. ''[[Young Magazine]]'' Pirate Edition, 2003.</ref>\n\n===Themes===\nOne of the core underlying themes of the Ghost in the Shell franchise is the proposition that when [[human consciousness]] and [[individuality]], essentially the \u201cghost,\u201d can exist independently of a [[physical body]], visual identification of [[ethnicity]] is no longer relevant.<ref>https://www.animenation.net/blog/what-killed-ghost-in-the-shell/</ref>\n\n===Setting===\n{{Main|World of Ghost in the Shell|List of Ghost in the Shell characters}}\nPrimarily set in the mid-twenty-first century in the fictional Japanese city of {{nihongo|Niihama, Niihama Prefecture|\u65b0\u6d5c\u770c\u65b0\u6d5c\u5e02|Niihama-ken Niihama-shi}},<ref group=Note>There is a real-world [[Niihama, Ehime|Niihama]], located in [[Ehime Prefecture]], but its name is written differently in [[kanji]]: {{nihongo2|\u65b0\u5c45\u6d5c\u5e02}}.</ref> otherwise known as {{nihongo|New Port City|\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30dd\u30fc\u30c8\u30b7\u30c6\u30a3|Ny\u016b P\u014dto Shiti}}, the manga and the many anime adaptations follow the members of [[Public Security Section 9]], a special-operations task-force made up of former military officers and police detectives. Political intrigue and counter-terrorism operations are standard fare for Section 9, but the various actions of corrupt officials, companies, and cyber-criminals in each scenario are unique and require the diverse skills of Section 9's staff to prevent a series of incidents from escalating.\n \nIn this [[post-cyberpunk]] iteration of a possible future, computer technology has advanced to the point that many members of the public possess cyberbrains, technology that allows them to interface their biological brain with various networks. The level of cyberization varies from simple minimal interfaces to almost complete replacement of the brain with cybernetic parts, in cases of severe trauma. This can also be combined with various levels of [[prostheses]], with a fully prosthetic body enabling a person to become a [[cyborg]]. The main character of ''Ghost in the Shell'', Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]], is such a cyborg, having had a terrible accident befall her as a child that ultimately required her to use a full-body prosthesis to house her cyberbrain. This high level of cyberization, however, opens the brain up to attacks from highly skilled hackers, with the most dangerous being those who will hack a person to bend to their whims.\n\n==Media==\n===Literature===\n====Original manga====\n{{Main|Ghost in the Shell (manga)}}\nThe original ''Ghost in the Shell'' manga ran in Japan from April 1989 to November 1990 in [[Kodansha]]'s manga anthology ''[[Young Magazine]]'', and was released in a ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volume on October 5, 1991.<ref name=\"GITS-KC\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u653b\u6bbb\u6a5f\u52d5\u968a\uff08\uff11\uff09 |url= http://kc.kodansha.co.jp/product/top.php/1234577897 |language= Japanese |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |accessdate=2012-10-13 }}</ref> ''Ghost in the Shell 2: Man-Machine Interface'' followed 1997 for 9 issues in ''Young Magazine'', and was collected in the ''Ghost in the Shell: Solid Box'' on December 1, 2000.<ref name=\"GITS2-solidbox-KC\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u653b\u6bbb\u6a5f\u52d5\u968a\uff33\uff2f\uff2c\uff29\uff24 \uff22\uff2f\uff38 |url= http://www.7netshopping.jp/books/detail/-/accd/1101992033/subno/1 |language= Japanese |publisher=7net |accessdate=2012-10-13 }}</ref> Four stories from ''Man-Machine Interface'' that were not released in tankobon format from previous releases were later collected in ''Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor'', and published by Kodansha on July 23, 2003.<ref name=\"GITS1.5-KC\">{{cite web |script-title=ja:\u653b\u6bbb\u6a5f\u52d5\u968a \uff11\uff0e\uff15 |url= http://kc.kodansha.co.jp/product/top.php/1234588254 |language= Japanese |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |accessdate=2012-10-13 }}</ref> Several art books have also been published for the manga.\n\n===Films===\n====Animated films====\n{{Main|Ghost in the Shell (1995 film)|Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence|l2=Innocence|Ghost in the Shell: The New Movie}}\nTwo animated films based on the original manga have been released, both directed by [[Mamoru Oshii]] and animated by [[Production I.G]].

GPRS was established by [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI) in response to the earlier [[CDPD]] and [[i-mode]] packet-switched cellular technologies. It is now maintained by the [[3rd Generation Partnership Project]] (3GPP).<ref>[http://www.etsi.org/WebSite/homepage.aspx ETSI]</ref><ref>[http://www.3gpp.org/ 3GPP]</ref>\n\nGPRS is typically sold according to the total volume of data transferred during the billing cycle, in contrast with [[circuit switching|circuit switched]] data, which is usually billed per minute of connection time, or sometimes by one-third minute increments. Usage above the GPRS [[Product bundling|bundled data cap]] may be charged per [[megabyte|Mb]] of data, speed limited, or disallowed.\n\nGPRS is a [[best-effort]] service, implying variable [[throughput]] and [[latency (engineering)|latency]] that depend on the number of other users sharing the service concurrently, as opposed to [[circuit switching]], where a certain [[quality of service]] (QoS) is guaranteed during the connection.  In 2G systems, GPRS provides data rates of 56\u2013114 [[Kilobit|kbit]]/sec.<ref>[http://about.qkport.com/g/general_packet_radio_service General packet radio service from Qkport]</ref> [[2G]] cellular technology combined with GPRS is sometimes described as ''[[2.5G]]'', that is, a technology between the second ([[2G]]) and third ([[3G]]) generations of mobile telephony.<ref>[http://www.funsms.net/mobile_phone_generations.htm Mobile Phone Generations from] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611210121/http://www.funsms.net/mobile_phone_generations.htm |date=June 11, 2010 }}</ref> It provides moderate-speed data transfer, by using unused [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA) channels in, for example, the GSM system. GPRS is integrated into GSM Release 97 and newer releases.\n\n== Technical overview ==\n{{See also|GPRS Core Network}}\nThe GPRS core network allows [[2G]], [[3G]] and [[WCDMA]] [[mobile telephony|mobile networks]] to transmit [[Internet protocol|IP]] packets to external networks such as the [[Internet]].  The GPRS system is an integrated part of the [[GSM]] [[network switching subsystem]].\n\n=== Services offered ===\nGPRS extends the GSM Packet circuit switched data capabilities and makes the following services possible:\n* [[SMS]] messaging and broadcasting\n* \"Always on\" internet access\n* [[Multimedia Messaging Service|Multimedia messaging service]] (MMS)\n* [[Push-to-talk]] over cellular (PoC)\n* [[Instant messaging]] and presence\u2014[[Wireless Village|wireless village]]\n* Internet applications for smart devices through [[Wireless Application Protocol|wireless application protocol]] (WAP)\n* [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Point-to-point]] (P2P) service: inter-networking with the Internet (IP)\n* [[Point-to-multipoint communication|Point-to-multipoint]] (P2M) service{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}: point-to-multipoint multicast and point-to-multipoint group calls\n\nIf SMS over GPRS is used, an SMS transmission speed of about 30 SMS messages per minute may be achieved. This is much faster than using the ordinary SMS over GSM, whose SMS transmission speed is about 6 to 10 SMS messages per minute.\n\n=== Protocols supported ===\nGPRS supports the following protocols:\n* [[Internet Protocol]] (IP). In practice, built-in [[mobile browser]]s use [[IPv4]] before [[IPv6]] is widespread.\n* [[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP) is typically not supported by [[mobile phone operator]]s but if a cellular phone is used as a [[modem]] for a connected computer, PPP may be used to tunnel IP to the phone. This allows an IP address to be dynamically assigned (using [[Internet Protocol Control Protocol|IPCP]] rather than [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]]) to the mobile equipment.\n* [[X.25]] connections are typically used for applications like wireless payment terminals, although it has been removed from the standard. X.25 can still be supported over PPP, or even over  IP, but this requires either a network-based [[Router (computing)|router]] to perform encapsulation or software built into the end-device/terminal; e.g., user equipment (UE).\n\nWhen [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] is used, each phone can have one or more [[IP address]]es allocated. GPRS will store and forward the IP packets to the phone even during [[handover]]. The TCP restores any packets lost (e.g. due to a radio noise induced pause).\n\n=== Hardware ===\nDevices supporting GPRS are grouped into three classes:\n;Class A: Can be connected to GPRS service and GSM service (voice, SMS) simultaneously. Such devices are now available{{as of?|date=June 2018}}.\n;Class B: Can be connected to GPRS service and GSM service (voice, SMS), but using only one at a time. During GSM service (voice call or SMS), GPRS service is suspended and resumed automatically after the GSM service (voice call or SMS) has concluded. Most GPRS mobile devices are Class B.\n;Class C: Are connected to either GPRS service or GSM service (voice, SMS) and must be switched manually between one service and the other.\n\nBecause a Class A device must service GPRS and GSM networks together, it effectively needs two radios. To avoid this hardware requirement, a GPRS mobile device may implement the [[Dual Transfer Mode|dual transfer mode (DTM)]] feature. A DTM-capable mobile can handle both GSM packets and GPRS packets with network coordination to ensure both types are not transmitted at the same time. Such devices are considered pseudo-Class A, sometimes referred to as \"simple class A\". Some networks have supported DTM since 2007{{cn|date=June 2018}}.\n\n[[Image:Huawei E220 (Three).jpg|right|thumb|120px|[[Huawei E220]] 3G/GPRS Modem]]\nUSB 3G/GPRS modems have a [[terminal software|terminal]]-like interface over [[USB]] with [[V.42bis]], and [[Request for comment|RFC]] 1144 data formats. Some models include an external [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] connector. Modem cards for laptop PCs, or external USB modems are available, similar in shape and size to a [[computer mouse]], or a [[pendrive]].\n\n=== Addressing ===\nA GPRS connection is established by reference to its [[Access Point Name|access point name]] (APN). The APN defines the services such as [[Wireless Application Protocol|wireless application protocol]] (WAP)\naccess, [[Short Message Service|short message service]] (SMS), [[Multimedia Messaging Service|multimedia messaging service]] (MMS), and for [[Internet]] communication services such as [[email]] and [[World Wide Web]] access.\n\nIn order to set up a GPRS connection for a [[Mobile broadband modem|wireless modem]], a user must specify an APN, optionally a user name and password, and very rarely an [[IP address]],  provided by the network operator.\n\n=== GPRS modems and modules ===\nGSM module or GPRS modules are similar to modems, but there\u2019s one difference: the modem is an external piece of equipment, whereas the GSM module or GPRS module can be integrated within an electrical or electronic equipment. It is an embedded piece of hardware. A GSM mobile, on the other hand, is a complete embedded system in itself. It comes with embedded processors dedicated to provide a functional interface between the user and the mobile network.\n\n== Coding schemes and speeds ==\nThe upload and download speeds that can be achieved in GPRS depend on a number of factors such as:\n\n* the number of [[Base Transceiver Station|BTS]] TDMA time slots assigned by the operator\n* the channel encoding used.\n* the maximum capability of the mobile device expressed as a [[Multislot Class|GPRS multislot class]]\n\n=== Multiple access schemes ===\nThe [[multiple access method]]s used in GSM with GPRS are based on [[frequency division duplex]] (FDD) and TDMA. During a session, a user is assigned to one pair of up-link and down-link frequency channels. This is combined with time domain [[statistical multiplexing]] which makes it possible for several users to share the same frequency channel. The '''packets''' have constant length, corresponding to a GSM time slot. The down-link uses [[first-come first-served]] packet scheduling, while the up-link uses a scheme very similar to [[reservation ALOHA]] (R-ALOHA). This means that [[slotted ALOHA]] (S-ALOHA) is used for reservation inquiries during a contention phase, and then the actual data is transferred using [[dynamic TDMA]] with first-come first-served.\n\n=== Channel encoding ===\nThe channel encoding process in GPRS consists of two steps: first, a cyclic code is used to add parity bits, which are also referred to as the Block Check Sequence, followed by coding with a possibly punctured [[convolutional code]].<ref name=TS45001>{{cite web |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/45001.htm |title=3GGP TS45.001: Technical Specification Group GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network; Physical layer on the radio path; General description |author=3rd Generation Partnership Project |version=12.1.0 |date=November 2014 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}</ref> The Coding Schemes CS-1 to CS-4 specify the number of parity bits generated by the cyclic code and the puncturing rate of the convolutional code.<ref name=TS45001/> In Coding Schemes CS-1 through CS-3, the convolutional code is of rate 1/2, i.e. each input bit is converted into two coded bits.<ref name=TS45001/> In Coding Schemes CS-2 and CS-3, the output of the convolutional code is [[puncturing|punctured]] to achieve the desired code rate.<ref name=TS45001/> In Coding Scheme CS-4, no convolutional coding is applied.<ref name=TS45001/> The following table summarises the options.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n!

However, using this scheme the cell coverage is 25% of normal. CS-1 can achieve a user speed of only 8.0 kbit/s per time slot, but has 98% of normal coverage. Newer network equipment can adapt the transfer speed automatically depending on the mobile location.\n\nIn addition to GPRS, there are two other GSM technologies which deliver data services: [[Circuit Switched Data|circuit-switched data]] (CSD) and [[high-speed circuit-switched data]] (HSCSD).  In contrast to the shared nature of GPRS, these instead establish a dedicated circuit (usually billed per minute).  Some applications such as [[video calling]] may prefer HSCSD, especially when there is a continuous flow of data between the endpoints.\n\nThe following table summarises some possible configurations of GPRS and circuit switched data services.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" align=center\n!

It is a value between 1 and 45 which the network uses to allocate radio channels in the uplink and downlink direction.  Multislot class with values greater than 31 are referred to as high multislot classes.\n\nA multislot allocation is represented as, for example, 5+2. The first number is the number of downlink timeslots and the second is the number of uplink timeslots allocated for use by the mobile station.  A commonly used value is class 10 for many GPRS/EGPRS mobiles which uses a maximum of 4 timeslots in downlink direction and 2 timeslots in uplink direction. However simultaneously a maximum number of 5 simultaneous timeslots can be used in both uplink and downlink. The network will automatically configure for either 3+2 or 4+1 operation depending on the nature of data transfer.\n\nSome high end mobiles, usually also supporting [[UMTS]], also support GPRS/[[EDGE]] multislot class 32. According to [[3GPP]] TS 45.002 (Release 12), Table B.1,<ref name=TS45002>{{cite web |url=http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/45002.htm |title=3GGP TS45.002: Technical Specification Group GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network; Multiplexing and multiple access on the radio path (Release 12) |version=12.4.0 |author=3rd Generation Partnership Project |date=March 2015 |accessdate=2015-12-05}}</ref> mobile stations of this class support 5 timeslots in downlink and 3 timeslots in uplink with a maximum number of 6 simultaneously used timeslots. If data traffic is concentrated in downlink direction the network will configure the connection for 5+1 operation. When more data is transferred in the uplink the network can at any time change the constellation to 4+2 or 3+3. Under the best reception conditions, i.e. when the best EDGE [[modulation and coding scheme]] can be used, 5 timeslots can carry a bandwidth of 5*59.2 kbit/s = 296 kbit/s. In uplink direction, 3 timeslots can carry a bandwidth of 3*59.2 kbit/s = 177.6 kbit/s.<ref>[http://mobilesociety.typepad.com/mobile_life/2007/04/gprs_and_edge_m.html GPRS and EDGE Multislot Classes]</ref>\n\n==== Multislot Classes for GPRS/EGPRS ====\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

[[Lag|Latency]] is very high; round-trip time (RTT) is typically about 600\u2013700 ms and often reaches 1s. GPRS is typically prioritized lower than speech, and thus the quality of connection varies greatly.\n\nDevices with latency/RTT improvements (via, for example, the extended UL TBF mode feature) are generally available. Also, network upgrades of features are available with certain operators. With these enhancements the active round-trip time can be reduced, resulting in significant increase in application-level throughput speeds.\n\n== History of GPRS ==\n\nGPRS opened in 2000 as a packet-switched data service embedded to the channel-switched cellular radio network [[GSM]]. GPRS extends the reach of the fixed Internet by connecting mobile terminals worldwide.\n\nThe CELLPAC<ref>Bernhard Walke, Wolf Mende, Georgios Hatziliadis: \u201cCELLPAC: A packet radio protocol applied to the cellular GSM mobile radio network\u201d, Proceedings of 41st IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference, May 1991, 408-413.</ref> protocol developed 1991-1993 was the trigger point for starting in 1993 specification of standard GPRS by ETSI [http://www.gsma.com/aboutus/history SMG].

This is the spiritual knowledge which all the holy Prophets, the Apostles, Martyrs, ascetics and all the Saints of the Church had. The teachings of the Saints are an offspring of this spiritual knowledge.

The adoption of conclusions or findings of a scientific branch by non-specialists (i.e. those who are unable to experimentally examine the research of the specialists) is based on the trust of the specialists credibility. Otherwise, there would be no scientific progress.\nThe same holds true for the science of faith. The empirical knowledge of the Saints, Prophets, Apostles, Fathers and Mothers of all ages is adopted and founded upon the same trust.

(Harvard University)|Massachusetts Hall]] at [[Harvard University]], 1718-20]]\n'''Georgian architecture''' is the name given in most [[English-speaking countries]] to the set of [[architectural style]]s current between 1714 and 1830. It is [[Namesake|eponymous]] for the first four [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarchs]] of the [[House of Hanover]]\u2014[[George I of Great Britain|George I]], [[George II of Great Britain|George II]], [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], and [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]]\u2014who reigned in continuous succession from August 1714 to June 1830. The style was revived in the late 19th century in the United States as [[Colonial Revival architecture]] and in the early 20th century in Great Britain as '''Neo-Georgian architecture'''; in both it is also called '''Georgian Revival architecture'''. In the United States the term \"Georgian\" is generally used to describe all buildings from the period, regardless of style; in Britain it is generally restricted to buildings that are \"architectural in intention\",<ref>A phrase used by [[John Summerson]], distinguishing among commercial buildings, Summerson, 252</ref> and have stylistic characteristics that are typical of the period, though that covers a wide range. \n\nThe Georgian style is highly variable, but marked by symmetry and proportion based on the [[classical architecture]] of [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greece]] and [[Roman architecture|Rome]], as revived in [[Renaissance architecture]]. Ornament is also normally in the classical tradition, but typically restrained, and sometimes almost completely absent on the exterior. The period brought the vocabulary of classical architecture to smaller and more modest buildings than had been the case before, replacing English [[vernacular architecture]] (or becoming the new vernacular style) for almost all new middle-class homes and public buildings by the end of the period.\n\nGeorgian architecture is characterized by its proportion and balance; simple mathematical ratios were used to determine the height of a window in relation to its width or the shape of a room as a double cube. Regularity, as with [[ashlar]] (uniformly cut) stonework, was strongly approved, imbuing symmetry and adherence to classical rules: the lack of symmetry, where Georgian additions were added to earlier structures remaining visible, was deeply felt as a flaw, at least before Nash began to introduce it in a variety of styles.<ref>Musson, 33\u201334, 52\u201353</ref> Regularity of housefronts along a street was a desirable feature of Georgian town planning. Until the start of the [[Gothic Revival]] in the early 19th century, Georgian designs usually lay within the [[Classical order|Classical orders of architecture]] and employed a decorative vocabulary derived from ancient Rome or Greece.\n\n==Characteristics==\nIn towns, which expanded greatly during the period, landowners turned into [[property developer]]s, and rows of identical [[terraced house]]s became the norm.<ref>Summerson, 26\u201328, 73\u201386</ref> Even the wealthy were persuaded to live in these in town, especially if provided with a [[Garden square|square of garden]] in front of the house. There was an enormous amount of building in the period, all over the English-speaking world, and the standards of construction were generally high. Where they have not been demolished, large numbers of Georgian buildings have survived two centuries or more, and they still form large parts of the core of cities such as [[London]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Georgian Dublin|Dublin]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] and [[Bristol]].\n\nThe period saw the growth of a distinct and trained architectural profession; before the mid-century \"the high-sounding title, 'architect' was adopted by anyone who could get away with it\".<ref>Summerson, 47\u201349, 47 quoted</ref> This contrasted with earlier styles, which were primarily disseminated among craftsmen through the direct experience of the apprenticeship system. But most buildings were still designed by builders and landlords together, and the wide spread of Georgian architecture, and the Georgian styles of [[design]] more generally, came from dissemination through [[pattern book]]s and inexpensive suites of [[engraving]]s. Authors such as the prolific [[William Halfpenny]] (active 1723\u20131755) had editions in America as well as Britain. \n\nA similar phenomenon can be seen in the commonality of housing designs in Canada and the United States (though of a wider variety of styles) from the 19th century down to the 1950s, using pattern books drawn up by professional architects that were distributed by lumber companies and hardware stores to contractors and homebuilders.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Reiff|first1=Daniel D.|title=Houses from Books|date=2001|publisher=Penn State University Press|location=University Park, Pa.|isbn=9780271019437|url=http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/0-271-01943-3.html|accessdate=28 February 2017}}</ref>  \n \nFrom the mid-18th century, Georgian styles were assimilated into an [[Vernacular architecture|architectural vernacular]] that became part and parcel of the training of every [[architect]], [[designer]], [[construction worker|builder]], [[carpenter]], [[masonry|mason]] and [[plasterer]], from [[Edinburgh]] to [[Maryland]].<ref>Summerson, 49\u201351; [[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/patternbooks.html \"Palladio and Patternbooks in Colonial America.\"]</ref>\n\n==Styles==\nGeorgian succeeded the [[English Baroque]] of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], [[John Vanbrugh|Sir John Vanbrugh]], [[Thomas Archer]], [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]], and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]]; this in fact continued into at least the 1720s, overlapping with a more restrained Georgian style. The architect [[James Gibbs]] was a transitional figure, his earlier buildings are Baroque, reflecting the time he spent in [[Rome]] in the early 18th century, but he adjusted his style after 1720.<ref>Summerson, 61\u201370, and see index</ref> Major [[architect]]s to promote the change in direction from baroque were [[Colen Campbell]], author of the influential book ''[[Vitruvius Britannicus]]'' (1715\u20131725); [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[William Kent]]; [[Isaac Ware]]; [[Henry Flitcroft]] and the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Giacomo Leoni]], who spent most of his career in England. \n[[File:Stowe House 04.jpg|thumb|left|[[Palladian]] grandeur; [[Stowe House]] by [[William Kent]]]]\n\nOther prominent architects of the early Georgian period include [[James Paine (architect)|James Paine]], [[Robert Taylor (architect)|Robert Taylor]], and [[John Wood, the Elder]]. The European [[Grand Tour]] became very common for wealthy patrons in the period, and Italian influence remained dominant,<ref>Jenkins (2003), xiv; Musson, 31</ref> though at the start of the period [[Hanover Square, Westminster]] (1713 on), developed and occupied by Whig supporters of the new dynasty, seems to have deliberately adopted German stylisic elements in their honour, especially vertical bands connecting the windows.<ref>Summerson, 73\u201374</ref>\n\nThe styles that resulted fall within several categories. In the mainstream of Georgian style were both [[Palladian architecture]]\u2014and its whimsical alternatives, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Chinoiserie]], which were the [[English-speaking world]]'s equivalent of [[Europe]]an [[Rococo]]. From the mid-1760s a range of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] modes were fashionable, associated with the British architects [[Robert Adam]], [[James Gibbs]], Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]], [[James Wyatt]], [[George Dance the Younger]], [[Henry Holland (architect)|Henry Holland]] and Sir [[John Soane]]. [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] was one of the most prolific architects of the late Georgian era known as [[Regency architecture|The Regency]] style, he was responsible for designing large areas of London.<ref>Summerson, see index on all these; Jenkins (2003), xv\u2013xiv; Musson, 28\u201335</ref> [[Greek Revival architecture]] was added to the  repertory, beginning around 1750, but increasing in popularity after 1800. Leading exponents were [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]] and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]].  \n\nIn Britain [[brick]] or [[Masonry|stone]] are almost invariably used;<ref>Summerson, 54\u201356</ref> brick is often disguised with [[stucco]]. In America and other colonies wood remained very common, as its availability and cost-ratio with the other materials was more favourable. Raked roofs were mostly covered in earthenware tiles until [[Richard Pennant, 1st Baron Penrhyn]] led the development of the [[slate industry in Wales]] from the 1760s, which by the end of the century had become the usual material.<ref>Summerson, 55</ref>\n\n==Types of buildings==\n\n===Houses===\n[[File:WestoverPlantationSEGL.jpg|thumb|right|[[Westover Plantation]] - Georgian country house on a [[plantation]] on the [[James River]] in [[Virginia]]]]\n\nVersions of revived [[Palladian architecture]] dominated [[English country house]] architecture. Houses were increasingly placed in grand landscaped settings, and large houses were generally made wide and relatively shallow, largely to look more impressive from a distance. The height was usually highest in the centre, and the Baroque emphasis on corner pavilions often found on the continent generally avoided. In grand houses, an entrance hall led to steps up to a ''[[piano nobile]]'' or [[mezzanine]] floor where the main reception rooms were. Typically the basement area or \"rustic\", with kitchens, offices and service areas, as well as male guests with muddy boots,<ref>Musson, 31; Jenkins (2003), xiv</ref> came some way above ground, and was lit by windows that were high on the inside, but just above ground level outside. A single block was typical, with perhaps a small court for carriages at the front marked off by railings and a gate, but rarely a stone [[gatehouse]], or side wings around the court.\n\nWindows in all types of buildings were large and regularly placed on a grid; this was partly to minimize [[window tax]], which was in force throughout the period in the United Kingdom. Some windows were subsequently bricked-in. Their height increasingly varied between the floors, and they increasingly began below waist-height in the main rooms, making a small [[balcony]] desirable. Before this the internal plan and function of the rooms can generally not be deduced from the outside. To open these large windows the [[sash window]], already developed by the 1670s, became very widespread.<ref>Musson, 73-76; Summerson, 46</ref> [[Hall|Corridor]] plans became universal inside larger houses.<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 420</ref>\n\nInternal courtyards became more rare, except beside the stables, and the functional parts of the building were placed at the sides, or in separate buildings nearby hidden by trees. The views to and from the front and rear of the main block were concentrated on, with the side approaches usually much less important. The roof was typically invisible from the ground, though domes were sometimes visible in grander buildings. The roofline was generally clear of ornament except for a [[balustrade]] or the top of a [[pediment]].<ref>Musson, 51; Bannister Fletcher, 420</ref> Columns or [[pilaster]]s, often topped by a pediment, were popular for ornament inside and out,<ref>Bannister Fletcher, 420</ref> and other ornament was generally geometrical or plant-based, rather than using the human figure. \n[[File:Syon House 2.jpg|thumb|left|Grand [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] interior by [[Robert Adam]], [[Syon House]], London]]\n\nInside ornament was far more generous, and could sometimes be overwhelming.<ref>Jenkins (2003), xv; Musson, 31</ref> The [[chimneypiece]] continued to be the usual main focus of rooms, and was now given a classical treatment, and increasingly topped by a painting or a mirror.<ref>Musson, 84\u201387</ref> [[Plasterwork]] ceilings,<ref>Musson, 113\u2013116</ref> carved wood, and bold schemes of wallpaint formed a backdrop to increasingly rich collections of furniture, paintings, [[porcelain]], mirrors, and [[objets d'art]] of all kinds.<ref>Jenkins (2003), xv</ref> Wood-panelling, very common since about 1500, fell from favour around the mid-century, and [[wallpaper]] included very expensive imports from China.<ref>Musson, 101\u2013106</ref>\n\nSmaller houses in the country, such as vicarages, were simple regular blocks with visible raked roofs, and a central doorway, often the only ornamented area. Similar houses, often referred to as \"villas\" became common around the fringes of the larger cities, especially London,<ref>Summerson, 266\u2013269</ref> and detached houses in towns remained common, though only the very rich could afford them in central London.\n\nIn towns even most better-off people lived in terraced houses, which typically opened straight onto the street, often with a few steps up to the door. There was often an open space, protected by iron railings, dropping down to the basement level, with a discreet entrance down steps off the street for servants and deliveries; this is known as the [[Area (architecture)|\"area\"]].<ref>Summerson, 44\u201345</ref> This meant that the ground floor front was now removed and protected from the street and encouraged the main reception rooms to move there from the floor above. Where, as often, a new street or set of streets was developed, the road and pavements were raised up, and the gardens or yards behind the houses at a lower level, usually representing the original one.<ref>Summerson, 44\u201345</ref>\n\nTown terraced houses for all social classes remained resolutely tall and narrow, each dwelling occupying the whole height of the building. This contrasted with well-off continental dwellings, which had already begun to be formed of wide apartments occupying only one or two floors of a building; such arrangements were only typical in England when housing groups of batchelors, as in [[Oxbridge]] colleges, the lawyers in the [[Inns of Court]] or [[Albany (London)|The Albany]] after it was converted in 1802.<ref>Summerson, 45</ref> In the period in question, only in [[Edinburgh]] were working-class purpose-built [[tenement]]s common, though lodgers were common in other cities. A curving [[Crescent (architecture)|crescent]], often looking out at gardens or a park, was popular for terraces where space allowed. In early and central schemes of development, plots were sold and built on individually, though there was often an attempt to enforce some uniformity,<ref>Summerson, 73\u201386</ref> but as development reached further out schemes were increasingly built as a uniform scheme and then sold.<ref>Summerson, 147\u2013191</ref> \n\nThe late Georgian period saw the birth of the [[semi-detached]] house, planned systematically, as a [[suburb]]an compromise between the terraced houses of the city and the detached \"villas\" further out, where land was cheaper. There had been occasional examples in town centres going back to medieval times. Most early suburban examples are large, and in what are now the outer fringes of Central London, but were then in areas being built up for the first time. [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]], [[Chalk Farm]] and [[St John's Wood]] are among the areas contesting being the original home of the semi.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,,-1454,00.html correspondence in The Guardian]</ref> Sir [[John Summerson]] gave primacy to the Eyre Estate of St John's Wood. A plan for this exists dated 1794, where \"the whole development consists of ''pairs of semi-detached houses'', So far as I know, this is the first recorded scheme of the kind\". In fact the French Wars put an end to this scheme, but when the development was finally built it retained the semi-detached form, \"a revolution of striking significance and far-reaching effect\".<ref>Summerson, 159-160</ref>\n\n===Churches===\n[[File:St Martin-in-the-Fields, July 2011.jpg|thumb|[[St Martin-in-the-Fields]], London (1720), [[James Gibbs]]]]\n[[File:The courtyard of Somerset House, Strand, London - geograph.org.uk - 1601172.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of [[Somerset House]], from the North Wing entrance. Built for government offices.]]\nUntil the [[Church Building Act 1818|Church Building Act of 1818]], the period saw relatively few churches built in Britain, which was already well-supplied,<ref>Summerson, 57\u201372, 206\u2013224; Jenkins (1999), xxii</ref> although in the later years of the period the demand for [[Non-conformist]] and Roman Catholic places of worship greatly increased.<ref>Summerson, 222\u2013224</ref> Anglican churches that were built were designed internally to allow maximum audibility, and visibility, for [[preaching]], so the main [[nave]] was generally wider and shorter than in medieval plans, and often there were no side-aisles. Galleries were common in new churches. Especially in country parishes, the external appearance generally retained the familiar signifiers of a Gothic church, with a tower or spire, a large west front with one or more doors, and very large windows along the nave, but all with any ornament drawn from the classical vocabulary. Where funds permitted, a classical temple portico with columns and a pediment might be used at the west front. Decoration inside was very limited, but churches filled up with monuments to the prosperous.<ref>Jenkins (1999), xx\u2013xxii</ref>\n\nIn the colonies new churches were certainly required, and generally repeated similar formulae. British Non-conformist churches were often more classical in mood, and tended not to feel the need for a tower or steeple.\n\nThe archetypical Georgian church is [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] in London (1720), by Gibbs, who boldly added to the classical temple fa\u00e7ade at the west end a large steeple on top of a tower, set back slightly from the main frontage. This formula shocked purists and foreigners, but became accepted and was very widely copied, at home and in the colonies,<ref>Summerson, 64\u201370</ref> for example at [[St Andrew's Church, Chennai]] in India.\n\nThe 1818 Act allocated some public money for new churches required to reflect changes in population, and a commission to allocate it. Building of [[Commissioners' church]]es gathered pace in the 1820s, and continued until the 1850s. The early churches, falling into the Georgian period, show a high proportion of [[Gothic Revival]] buildings, along with the classically inspired.<ref>Summerson, 212-221</ref>\n\n===Public buildings===\nPublic buildings generally varied between the extremes of plain boxes with grid windows and Italian Late Renaissance palaces, depending on budget. [[Somerset House]] in London, designed by [[Sir William Chambers]] in 1776 for government offices, was as magnificent as any country house, though never quite finished, as funds ran out.<ref>Summerson, 115\u2013120</ref> Barracks and other less prestigious buildings could be as functional as the mills and factories that were growing increasingly large by the end of the period. But as the period came to an end many commercial projects were becoming sufficiently large, and well-funded, to become \"architectural in intention\", rather than having their design left to the lesser class of \"surveyors\".<ref>Summerson, 47, 252\u2013262, 252 quoted</ref>\n\n==Colonial Georgian architecture==\n{{see also|Federal style architecture}}\n[[File:Hyde Park Barracks Sydney exterior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] (1819) Georgian architecture in [[Sydney]]]]\nGeorgian architecture was widely disseminated in the English colonies during the [[Georgian era]]. American buildings of the Georgian period were very often constructed of wood with clapboards; even columns were made of timber, framed up, and turned on an oversized lathe. At the start of the period the difficulties of obtaining and transporting brick or stone made them a common alternative only in the larger cities, or where they were obtainable locally. [[Dartmouth College]], [[Harvard University]], and the [[College of William and Mary]], offer leading examples of Georgian architecture in the Americas.\n\nUnlike the [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style that it replaced, which was mostly used for palaces and churches, and had little representation in the British colonies, simpler Georgian styles were widely used by the upper and middle classes. Perhaps the best remaining house is the pristine [[Hammond-Harwood House]] (1774) in [[Annapolis]], [[Maryland]], designed by the colonial architect [[William Buckland (architect)|William Buckland]] and modelled on the [[Villa Pisani (Montagnana)|Villa Pisani]] at [[Montagnana]], [[Italy]] as depicted in [[Andrea Palladio]]'s ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'' (\"Four Books of Architecture\").\n\nAfter independence, in the former [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], [[Federal style architecture]] represented the equivalent of Regency architecture, with which it had much in common.\n\nIn [[Australia]], the [[Australian residential architectural styles#Old Colonial Georgian Style|Old Colonial Georgian residential]] and [[Australian non-residential architectural styles#Georgian|non-residential]] styles were developed in the period from {{circa|1810|1840}}.\n\n==Post-Georgian developments==\n{{see also|Colonial Revival architecture}}\n[[File:Governors Hall StFX University.jpg|thumb|right|Georgian-style Governors Hall building at [[St. Francis Xavier University]], in Canada, completed in 2006.]]\nAfter about 1840, Georgian conventions were slowly abandoned as a number of revival styles, including [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]], that had originated in the Georgian period, developed and contested in [[Victorian architecture]], and in the case of Gothic became better researched, and closer to their originals. Neoclassical architecture remained popular, and was the opponent of Gothic in the [[Battle of the Styles]] of the early Victorian period. In the United States the Federalist Style contained many elements of Georgian style, but incorporated revolutionary symbols.\n\nIn the early decades of the twentieth century when there was a growing nostalgia for its sense of order, the style was revived and adapted and in the United States came to be known as the [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]]. In Canada the [[United Empire Loyalist]]s embraced Georgian architecture as a sign of their fealty to Britain, and the Georgian style was dominant in the country for most of the first half of the 19th century. [[The Grange (Toronto)|The Grange]], for example, a manor built in [[Toronto]], was built in 1817. In Montreal, English born architect [[John Ostell]] worked on a significant number of remarkable constructions in the Georgian style such as the [[Old Montreal Custom House]] and the [[Grand s\u00e9minaire de Montr\u00e9al]].\n\nThe revived Georgian style that emerged in Britain at the beginning of the 20th century is usually referred to as '''Neo-Georgian'''; the work of [[Edwin Lutyens]] includes many examples. Versions of the Neo-Georgian style were commonly used in Britain for certain types of urban architecture until the late 1950s, [[Bradshaw Gass & Hope]]'s Police Headquarters in [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] of 1958 being a good example. In both the United States and Britain, the Georgian style is still employed by architects like [[Quinlan Terry]] Julian Bicknell and Fairfax and Sammons for private residences.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:Ditchleyfront2.jpg|[[Ditchley House]] in [[Oxfordshire]], a typical country house.

They founded a large number of towns and counties across what is known as the [[Northern Tier (United States)|Northern Tier]] of the upper midwest.  It was in this context that Goshen was named.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">The Yankee Exodus: An Account of Migration from New England by Stewart Hall Holbrook University of Washington Press, 1968</ref><ref>American Zion: The Old Testament as a Political Text from the Revolution to ...

The old stock Yankee population had large families, often bearing up to ten children in one household.  Most people were expected to have their own piece of land to farm, and due to the massive and nonstop population boom, land in New England became scarce as every son claimed his own farmstead.  As a result, there was not enough land for every family to have a self-sustaining farm, and Yankee settlers began leaving New England for the [[Midwestern United States]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">A Twentieth Century History and Biographical Record of Elkhart County, Indiana  edited by Anthony Deahl, Lewis Publishing Company, 1905</ref>\n\nThey were aided in this effort by the construction and completion of the [[Erie Canal]] which made traveling to the region much easier, causing an additional surge in migrants coming from New England.  Added to this was the end of the [[Black Hawk War]], which made the region much safer to travel through and settle in for white settlers.  These settlers were primarily members of the [[Congregational Church]], though due to the [[Second Great Awakening]], many of them had converted to [[Methodism]], and some had become [[Baptists]] before coming to what is now Indiana. The Congregational Church has subsequently gone through many divisions, and some factions, including those in Goshen, are now known as the [[Church of Christ]] and the [[United Church of Christ]].<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>  When the New Englanders arrived in what is now Elkhart County there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n[[File:palmsundaytwintornadoes.jpg|thumb|right|This double tornado hit the Midway Trailer Court northwest of Goshen on U.S. 33, Palm Sunday, 1965.]]\nOn Palm Sunday, April 11, 1965, a [[1965 Palm Sunday tornado outbreak|large outbreak of tornadoes]] struck the Midwest.

It also benefited from its strategic importance on the main route between [[Europe]] and [[Asia]], as well as from its control of the shipping route from [[Crimea]]. The city of Sestos was the main crossing-point on the [[Hellespont]].\n\nAccording to [[Herodotus]], the Thracian tribe of Dolonci ({{lang-el|\u0394\u03cc\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03b9}}) (or \"barbarians\" according to Cornelius Nepos) held possession of Chersonesus before the Greek colonization.

He took authority over the entire peninsula, building up its defences against incursions from the mainland. It eventually passed to his nephew, the more famous [[Miltiades the Younger]], around 524 BC. The peninsula was abandoned to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in 493 BC after the outbreak of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013478 BC).\n\nThe Persians were eventually expelled, after which the peninsula was for a time ruled over by Athens, which enrolled it into the [[Delian League]] in 478 BC. The Athenians established a number of [[cleruchy|cleruchies]] on the Thracian Chersonese and sent an additional 1,000 settlers around 448 BC. Sparta gained control after the decisive battle of [[Aegospotami]] in 404 BC, but the peninsula subsequently reverted to the Athenians. In the 4th century BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the focus of a bitter territorial dispute between Athens and [[Macedon]], whose king [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]] sought possession. It was eventually ceded to Philip in 338 BC.\n\nAfter the death of Philip's son [[Alexander the Great]] in 323 BC, the Thracian Chersonese became the object of contention among [[Diadochi|Alexander's successors]]. [[Lysimachus]] established his capital [[Lysimachia (Thrace)|Lysimachia]] here. In 278 BC, Celtic tribes from [[Galatia]] in Asia Minor settled in the area. In 196 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus III the Great|Antiochus III]] seized the peninsula. This alarmed the Greeks and prompted them to seek the aid of the [[Roman Republic|Romans]], who conquered the Thracian Chersonese, which they gave to their ally [[Eumenes II]] of [[Pergamon]] in 188 BC. At the extinction of the [[Attalid dynasty]] in 133 BC it passed again to the Romans, who from 129 BC administered it in the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]]. It was subsequently made a state-owned territory (''ager publicus'') and during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]] it was imperial property.\n\nThe Thracian Chersonese was part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from its foundation in 330 AD. In 443 AD, [[Attila the Hun]] invaded the Gallipoli Peninsula during one of the last stages of his grand campaign that year. He captured both Callipolis and Sestus.<ref>{{cite book| title =Attila the Hun: Barbarian Terror and the Fall of the Roman Empire| url = https://books.google.gr/books?id=f-YN6NwHqq4C| publisher = Vintage | page = 105| isbn = 978-1844139156| date = 2011}}</ref> Aside from a brief period from 1204 to 1235, when it was controlled by the [[Republic of Venice]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] ruled the territory until 1356.

The Ottomans set up defensive fortifications along the peninsula and the attackers were eventually repulsed.\n\nIn early 1915, attempting to seize a strategic advantage in World War I by capturing [[Constantinople]], the British authorised an attack on the peninsula. The first Australian troops landed at [[ANZAC Cove]] on early morning 25 April 1915, and after eight months of heavy fighting the survivors were withdrawn around the end of the year.\n\nThe campaign was one of the greatest [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] victories during the war and is considered a major [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] failure. In [[Turkey]], it is regarded as a defining moment in the nation's history: a final surge in the defence of the motherland as the Ottoman Empire crumbled. The struggle formed the basis for the [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the founding of the Republic of Turkey eight years later under [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], who first rose to prominence as a commander at Gallipoli.\n\nThe [[Gallipoli Star (Ottoman Empire)|Gallipoli Star]] was a military decoration created by the Ottoman Empire in 1915 and awarded for the duration of World War I.\n\nThe campaign was the first major military action of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] as independent [[dominion]]s, and is often considered to mark the birth of national consciousness in those nations. The date of the landing, 25 April, is known as \"[[Anzac Day]]\".

However, Greece was forced to withdraw from Eastern Thrace after the [[Armistice of Mudanya]]. Gallipoli was briefly handed over to British troops on 20 October 1922, but was finally returned to Turkish rule on 26 November 1922.\n\nIn 1920, after the defeat of the [[White movement|Russian White army]] of General [[Pyotr Wrangel]], a significant number of [[white emigre|emigre soldiers]] and their families evacuated to Gallipoli from the [[Crimean Peninsula]].

The name comes from the Danish [[bacteriologist]] [[Hans Christian Gram]], who developed the technique.\n\nGram staining differentiates bacteria by the chemical and physical properties of their [[cell wall]]s by detecting [[peptidoglycan]], which is present in the cell wall of Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative cells also contain peptidoglycan, but a very small layer of it that is dissolved when the alcohol is added.

Both Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria pick up the counterstain. The counterstain, however, is unseen on Gram-positive bacteria because of the darker crystal violet stain.\n\nThe Gram stain is almost always the first step in the preliminary identification of a bacterial organism. While Gram staining is a valuable diagnostic tool in both clinical and research settings, not all bacteria can be definitively classified by this technique. This gives rise to ''gram-variable'' and ''gram-indeterminate'' groups.\n\n==History==\nThe method is named after its inventor, the [[Denmark|Danish]] scientist [[Hans Christian Gram]] (1853\u20131938), who developed the technique while working with [[Carl Friedl\u00e4nder]] in the morgue of the city hospital in [[Berlin]] in 1884.

It is used mainly to make a preliminary morphologic identification or to establish that there are significant numbers of bacteria in a clinical specimen. It cannot identify bacteria to the species level, and for most medical conditions, it should not be used as the sole method of bacterial identification. In clinical microbiology laboratories, it is used in combination with other traditional and molecular techniques to identify bacteria. Some organisms are gram-variable (meaning they may stain either negative or positive); some are not stained with either dye used in the Gram technique and are not seen. In a modern environmental or molecular microbiology lab, most identification is done using genetic sequences and other molecular techniques, which are far more specific and informative than differential staining.\n\nGram staining has been suggested to be as effective a diagnostic tool as [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] in one primary research report regarding gonococcal urethritis.<ref>El-Garnal, A.H., Al-Otaibi, S.R., Alshamali, A., Abdulrazzaq, A., Najem, N., and Fouzan, A.A.

This is because the thick [[peptidoglycan]] layer in the bacterial [[cell wall]] retains the [[stain (biology)|stain]] after it is washed away from the rest of the sample, in the decolorization stage of the test.\n\n[[Gram-negative bacteria]] cannot retain the violet stain after the decolorization step; alcohol used in this stage degrades the outer membrane of gram-negative cells, making the cell wall more porous and incapable of retaining the crystal violet stain. Their peptidoglycan layer is much thinner and sandwiched between an inner cell membrane and a [[bacterial outer membrane]], causing them to take up the [[counterstain]] ([[safranin]] or [[fuchsine]]) and appear red or pink.\n\nDespite their thicker peptidoglycan layer, gram-positive bacteria are more receptive to certain [[Cell_wall#Bacterial_cell_walls|cell wall]] targeting [[antibiotics]] than gram-negative bacteria, due to the absence of the outer membrane.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n[[File:Gram-Cell-wall.svg|thumb|right|300px|Gram-positive and gram-negative cell wall structure]]\n\n[[File:Gram-positive cellwall-schematic.png|thumb|right|Structure of gram-positive cell wall]]\n\nIn general, the following characteristics are present in gram-positive bacteria:<ref name=\"Brock\">{{cite book |last1=Madigan |first1=Michael T. |last2=Martinko |first2=John M. |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |date=2006 |isbn=0131443291}}</ref>\n\n# Cytoplasmic lipid membrane\n# Thick [[peptidoglycan]] layer\n# [[Teichoic acids]] and lipoids are present, forming [[lipoteichoic acid]]s, which serve as [[Chelation|chelating]] agents, and also for certain types of adherence.\n# Peptidoglycan chains are cross-linked to form rigid cell walls by a bacterial enzyme [[DD-transpeptidase]].\n# A much smaller volume of [[periplasm]] than that in gram-negative bacteria.\n\nOnly some species have a [[bacterial capsule|capsule]], usually consisting of [[polysaccharides]]. Also, only some species are [[flagellate]]s, and when they do have [[flagellum|flagella]], have only two [[basal body]] rings to support them, whereas gram-negative have four.

Gram-negative bacteria's S-layer is attached directly to the [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]]. Specific to gram-positive bacteria is the presence of [[teichoic acid]]s in the cell wall. Some of these are lipoteichoic acids, which have a lipid component in the cell membrane that can assist in anchoring the peptidoglycan.\n\n== Classification ==\n\nAlong with [[Bacterial cell structure#Cell morphology|cell shape]], Gram staining is a rapid method used to differentiate bacterial species. Such staining, together with growth requirement and antibiotic susceptibility testing, and other macroscopic and physiologic tests, forms the full basis for classification and subdivision of the bacteria (e.g., see figure and pre-1990 versions of ''[[Bergey's Manual]]'').\n\n[[File:Gram-Positive Classification.png|thumb|none|Species identification hierarchy in clinical settings|660px]]\n\n[[Bacterial taxonomy#history|Historically]], the kingdom [[Monera]] was divided into four [[Taxonomic rank|divisions]] based primarily on Gram staining: [[Firmicutes]] (positive in staining), [[Gracilicutes]] (negative in staining), [[Mollicutes]] (neutral in staining) and Mendocutes (variable in staining).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Gibbons |first=N.

The outer leaflet of this membrane comprises a complex lipopolysaccharide (LPS) whose [[lipid]] portion acts as an endotoxin. If gram-negative bacteria enter the [[circulatory system]], the liposaccharide can cause a toxic reaction. This results in fever, an increased respiratory rate, and low blood pressure. This may lead to life-threatening [[septic shock]].<ref name=\"ww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\nThe outer membrane protects the bacteria from several [[antibiotic]]s, dyes, and [[detergent]]s that would normally damage either the inner membrane or the cell wall (made of peptidoglycan). The outer membrane provides these bacteria with resistance to [[lysozyme]] and [[penicillin]]. The periplasmic space (space between the two cell membranes) also contains enzymes which break down or modify antibiotics. Drugs commonly used to treat gram negative infections include amino, carboxy and ureido penicillins (ampicillin, amoxicillin, pipercillin, ticarcillin) these drugs may be combined with [[beta-lactamase inhibitors]] to combat the presence of enzymes that can digest these drugs (known as beta-lactamases) in the peri-plasmic space. Other classes of drugs that have gram negative spectrum include cephalosporins, monobactams (aztreonam), aminogylosides, quinolones, macrolides, chloramphenicol, folate antagonists, and carbapenems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jwatch.org/id200312120000007/2003/12/12/gram-negative-bacteria-and-broad-spectrum|title=NEJM Journal Watch: Summaries of and commentary on original medical and scientific articles from key medical journals|website=www.jwatch.org}}</ref>\n\nThe pathogenic capability of gram-negative bacteria is often associated with certain components of their membrane, in particular, the LPS.<ref name=Baron /> In humans, the presence of LPS triggers an [[innate immune response]], activating the [[immune system]] and producing [[cytokine]]s (hormonal regulators).  [[Inflammation]] is a common reaction to cytokine production, which can also produce host toxicity.

In modern times, the professional racing industry, with its large numbers of track-bred Greyhounds, as well as international adoption programs aimed at rescuing and re-homing dogs that were at a surplus to the industry. They have redefined the breed in their almost mutually dependent pursuit of its welfare- as a sporting dog that will supply friendly companionship in its retirement.<ref>Madden, Raymond (2010) 'Imagining the greyhound: 'Racing' and 'rescue' narratives in a human and dog relationship', ''Continuum'', 24: 4, 503 \u2014 515 .</ref> Outside the racing industry and coursing community, the Kennel Clubs' registered breed still enjoys a modest following as a show dog and pet.

Some Greyhounds have been known to develop [[esophageal achalasia]], [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (also known as bloat), and [[osteosarcoma]]. If exposed to ''E. coli'', they may develop [[Alabama rot]]. Because the Greyhound's lean physique makes it ill-suited to sleeping on hard surfaces, owners of both racing and companion Greyhounds generally provide soft bedding; without bedding, Greyhounds are prone to develop painful skin sores.

Greyhound-type dogs of small, medium, and large size, appear to have been bred across Europe since that time. All modern, pure-bred pedigree Greyhounds derive from the Greyhound stock recorded and registered first in private studbooks in the 18th century, then in public studbooks in the 19th century, which ultimately were registered with coursing, racing, and kennel club authorities of the United Kingdom.\n\nHistorically, these [[sighthound]]s were used primarily for hunting in the open where their keen [[eyesight]] was valuable. It is believed that they (or at least similarly named dogs) were introduced to the [[British Isles]] in the 5th and 6th century BC from [[Celt]]ic mainland [[Europe]], although the [[Picts]] and other peoples of the northern British Isles (modern [[Scotland]]) were believed to have had large hounds similar to that of the [[deerhound]] before the 6th century BC.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nThe name \"Greyhound\" is generally believed to come from the [[Old English]] ''[[wikt:grighund|grighund]]''. \"Hund\" is the antecedent of the modern \"hound\", but the meaning of \"grig\" is undetermined, other than in reference to dogs in Old English and [[Old Norse]]. Its origin does not appear to have any common root with the modern word \"grey\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Richardson |first1=Charles |title=A New Dictionary of the English Language |date=1839 |publisher=Oxford University |page=357}}</ref> for color, and indeed the Greyhound is seen with a wide variety of coat colors. The lighter colors, patch-like markings and white appeared in the breed that was once ordinarily grey in color. The Greyhound is the only dog mentioned by name in the Bible; many versions, including the King James version, name the Greyhound as one of the \"four things stately\" in the Proverbs.<ref name=\"KJV Pv 30:29-31\">Proverbs 30:29\u201331 King James version.</ref> However, some newer biblical translations, including The New International Version, have changed this to ''strutting rooster'', which appears to be an alternative translation of the Hebrew term ''mothen zarzir''. However, the [[Douay\u2013Rheims Bible]] translation from the late 4th-century [[Latin]] [[Vulgate]] into [[English language|English]] translates this term as \"a [[rooster|cock]].\"\n\nAccording to [[Julius Pokorny|Pokorny]]<ref name=\"Pokorny\">Pokorny, ''Indogermanisches Woerterbuch'', pp. 441\u2013442.</ref> the English name \"Greyhound\" does not mean \"grey dog/hound\", but simply \"fair dog\".

Mathematically, a geometric algebra may be defined as the [[Clifford algebra]] of a [[vector space]] with a [[quadratic form]]. Clifford's contribution was to define a new product, the geometric product, that united the Grassmann and Hamilton algebras into a single structure. Adding the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of the Grassmann exterior product (the \"meet\") allows the use of the [[Grassmann\u2013Cayley algebra]], and a [[Conformal geometry|conformal version]] of the latter together with a conformal Clifford algebra yields a [[Conformal geometric algebra |conformal geometric algebra (CGA)]] providing a framework for [[Klein geometry|classical geometries]].{{sfn|Li|2008|p=411}} In practice, these and several derived operations allow a correspondence of elements, subspaces and operations of the algebra with geometric interpretations.\n\nThe scalars and vectors have their usual interpretation, and make up distinct subspaces of a GA. [[Bivector]]s provide a more natural representation of pseudovector quantities in [[vector algebra]] such as oriented area, oriented angle of rotation, torque, angular momentum, electromagnetic field and the [[Poynting vector]]. A [[trivector]] can represent an oriented volume, and so on. An element called a [[Blade (geometry)|blade]] may be used to represent a subspace of <math>V</math> and orthogonal projections onto that subspace. Rotations and reflections are represented as elements. Unlike vector algebra, a GA naturally accommodates any number of dimensions and any quadratic form such as in [[Theory of relativity|relativity]].\n\nSpecific examples of geometric algebras applied in physics include the [[spacetime algebra]] (or the less common alternative formulation, the [[algebra of physical space]]) and the [[conformal geometric algebra]]. [[Geometric calculus]], an extension of GA that incorporates [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], can be used to formulate other theories such as [[complex analysis]], [[differential geometry]], e.g. by using the Clifford algebra instead of [[differential form]]s. Geometric algebra has been advocated, most notably by [[David Hestenes]]{{sfn|Hestenes|2003}} and [[Chris J. L. Doran|Chris Doran]],{{sfn|Doran|1994}} as the preferred mathematical framework for [[physics]]. Proponents claim that it provides compact and intuitive descriptions in many areas including [[classical mechanics|classical]] and [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetic theory]] and [[theory of relativity|relativity]].{{sfn|Lasenby|Lasenby|Doran|2000}} GA has also found use as a computational tool in [[computer graphics]]{{sfn|Hildenbrand|Fontijne|Perwass|Dorst|2004}} and [[robotics]].\n\nThe geometric product was first briefly mentioned by [[Hermann Grassmann]],{{sfn|Hestenes|1986|loc=p. 6}} who was chiefly interested in developing the closely related [[exterior algebra]]. In 1878, [[William Kingdon Clifford]] greatly expanded on Grassmann's work to form what are now usually called Clifford algebras in his honor (although Clifford himself chose to call them \"geometric algebras\"). For several decades, geometric algebras went somewhat ignored, greatly eclipsed by the [[vector calculus]] then newly developed to describe electromagnetism. The term \"geometric algebra\" was repopularized in the 1960s by Hestenes, who advocated its importance to relativistic physics.{{sfn|Hestenes|1966}}\n\n==Definition and notation==\nThere are a number of different ways to define a geometric or Clifford algebra. Hestenes's original approach was axiomatic,{{sfn|Hestenes|Sobczyk|1984|p=3-5}} \"full of geometric significance\" and equivalent to the universal Clifford algebra.{{sfn|Arag\u00f3n|Arag\u00f3n|Rodr\u00edguez|1997|p=101}}\nGiven a finite-dimensional [[quadratic space]] <math>V</math> over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] <math>F</math> with a symmetric bilinear form (the ''inner product'', e.g. the Euclidean or [[Lorentzian metric]]) <math>g : V \\times V \\rightarrow F</math>, the '''geometric algebra''' for this quadratic space is the geometric algebra <math>\\operatorname{G}(V, g)</math>, together with the [[exterior algebra]] <math>{\\textstyle \\bigwedge}V</math>. Since it is usual in GA, for the remainder of this article, only the [[Real number|real]] case, <math>F = \\mathbf{R}</math>, will be considered. The notation <math>\\mathcal G(p,q)</math> or <math>\\mathcal G_{n}</math> will be used to describe the geometric algebra.\n\nThe essential product in the algebra is called the ''geometric product'', and the product in the contained exterior algebra is called the ''exterior product'' (frequently called the ''outer product'' and less often the ''wedge''). It is standard to denote these respectively by juxtaposition (i.e., suppressing any explicit multiplication symbol) and the symbol <math>\\wedge</math>. The above definition of the geometric algebra is abstract, so we summarize the properties of the geometric product by the following set of axioms. The geometric product of <math>\\mathcal G_{n}</math> has the following properties for multivectors <math> A, B, C</math>:\n\n:<math>AB \\in \\mathcal G_{n}</math>\n:<math>1A=A1=A</math>, where <math>1</math> is the unit and <math>A</math> any element of the algebra (existence of an identity element)\n:<math>A(BC)=(AB)C</math>, where <math>A</math>, <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> are any elements of the algebra ([[associativity]])\n:<math>A(B+C)=AB+AC</math> and <math>(B+C)A=BA+CA</math>, where <math>A</math>, <math>B</math> and <math>C</math> are any elements of the algebra ([[distributivity]])\n:<math>a^2 = g(a,a)1</math>, where <math>a</math> is any element of the subspace <math>V</math> of the algebra.(In other words, the geometric product <math>aa</math> is linked to the inner product <math>a \\cdot a</math>.)\n\nThe exterior product has the same properties, except that <math>a \\wedge a = 0</math> for <math>a \\in V</math>.\n\nNote that in the final property above, the real number <math>g(a,a)</math> need not be nonnegative if <math>g</math> is not positive-definite. An important property of the geometric product is the existence of elements having a multiplicative inverse. If <math>a^2 \\ne 0 </math> for some vector <math>a</math>, then <math>a^{-1}</math> exists and is equal to <math>g(a,a)^{-1}a</math>. A nonzero element of the algebra does not necessarily have a multiplicative inverse. For example, if <math>u</math> is a vector in <math>V</math> such that <math>u^2 = 1</math>, the element <math>\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)</math> is both a nontrivial [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]] and a nonzero [[zero divisor]], and thus has no inverse.{{efn|Given <math>\\textstyle u^2 = 1</math>, we have that <math>\\textstyle(\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u))^2 = \\frac{1}{4}(1 + 2u + uu) = \\frac{1}{4}(1 + 2u + 1) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)</math>, showing that <math>\\textstyle \\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)</math> is idempotent, and that <math>\\textstyle\\frac{1}{2}(1 + u)(1 - u) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - uu) = \\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1) = 0</math>, showing that it is a nonzero zero divisor.}}\n\nIt is usual to identify <math>1 \\in \\mathbf{R}</math> with <math>1 \\in \\operatorname{G}(V, g)</math>, with associated natural [[embedding]]s <math>\\mathbf{R} \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g)</math> and <math>V \\to \\operatorname{G}(V, g)</math>. In this article, this identification is assumed. Throughout, the term ''vector'' refers to an element of <math>V</math> (and its image under this embedding).\n\n===The Geometric Product===\n{{main|Symmetric bilinear form|Exterior algebra}}\n[[File:GA parallel and perpendicular vectors.svg|200px|right|thumb|Given two vectors <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, if the geometric product <math>ab</math> is<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Hestenes, David (2005), [http://geocalc.clas.asu.edu/html/IntroPrimerGeometricAlgebra.html Introduction to Primer for Geometric Algebra]</ref> anticommutative; they are perpendicular (top) because <math>a \\cdot b = 0</math>, if it is commutative; they are parallel (bottom) because <math>a \\wedge b = 0</math>.]]\n{{multiple image\n | left\n | footer = Geometric interpretation of grade-<math>n</math> elements in a real exterior algebra for <math>n = 0</math> (signed point), <math>1</math> (directed line segment, or vector), <math>2</math> (oriented plane element), <math>3</math> (oriented volume). The exterior product of <math>n</math> vectors can be visualized as any <math>n</math>-dimensional shape (e.g. <math>n</math>-[[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]], <math>n</math>-[[ellipsoid]]); with magnitude ([[hypervolume]]), and [[Orientation (vector space)|orientation]] defined by that on its <math>(n - 1)</math>-dimensional boundary and on which side the interior is.{{sfn|Penrose|2007}}{{sfn|Wheeler|Misner|1973|p=83}}\n | width1 = 220\n | image1 = N vector positive.svg\n | caption1 = Orientation defined by an ordered set of vectors.\n | width2 = 220\n | image2 = N vector negative.svg\n | caption2 = Reversed orientation corresponds to negating the exterior product.\n}}\nFor vectors <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, we may write the geometric product of any two vectors <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> as the sum of a symmetric product and an antisymmetric product:\n\n:<math>ab=\\frac{1}{2}(ab+ba)+\\frac{1}{2}(ab-ba)</math>\n\nThus we can define the ''inner product''{{efn|This is a synonym for the ''scalar product'' of a [[pseudo-Euclidean vector space]], and refers to the symmetric bilinear form on the <math>1</math>-vector subspace, not the [[inner product]] on a normed vector space. Some authors may extend the meaning of ''inner product'' to the entire algebra, but there is little consensus on this. Even in texts on geometric algebras, the term is not universally used.}} of vectors as\n\n:<math>a \\cdot b := g(a,b),</math>\n\nso that the symmetric product can be written as\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{2}(ab + ba) = \\frac{1}{2}((a+b)^2 - a^2 - b^2) = a \\cdot b</math>\n\nConversely, <math>g</math> is completely determined by the algebra. The antisymmetric part is the exterior product of the two vectors, the product of the contained [[exterior algebra]]:\n\n:<math>a \\wedge b := \\frac{1}{2}(ab - ba) = -(b \\wedge a)</math>\n\nThen by simple addition:\n\n:<math>ab=a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b </math> the ungeneralized or vector form of the geometric product.\n\nThe inner and exterior products are associated with familiar concepts from standard vector algebra. Geometrically, <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] if their geometric product is equal to their inner product, whereas <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are [[perpendicular]] if their geometric product is equal to their exterior product. In a geometric algebra for which the square of any nonzero vector is positive, the inner product of two vectors can be identified with the [[dot product]] of standard vector algebra. The exterior product of two vectors can be identified with the [[signed area]] enclosed by a [[parallelogram]] the sides of which are the vectors. The [[cross product]] of two vectors in <math>3</math> dimensions with positive-definite quadratic form is closely related to their exterior product.\n\nMost instances of geometric algebras of interest have a nondegenerate quadratic form. If the quadratic form is fully [[nondegenerate quadratic form|degenerate]], the inner product of any two vectors is always zero, and the geometric algebra is then simply an exterior algebra. Unless otherwise stated, this article will treat only nondegenerate geometric algebras.\n\nThe exterior product is naturally extended as an associative bilinear binary operator between any two elements of the algebra, satisfying the identities\n\n:<math>1 \\wedge a_i = a_i \\wedge 1 = a_i</math>\n:<math>a_1\\wedge a_2\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge a_r = \\frac{1}{r!}\\sum_{\\sigma\\in\\mathfrak{S}_r} \\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma) a_{\\sigma(1)}a_{\\sigma(2)} \\cdots a_{\\sigma(r)},</math>\n\nwhere the sum is over all permutations of the indices, with <math>\\operatorname{sgn}(\\sigma)</math> the [[parity of a permutation|sign of the permutation]], and <math>a_i</math> are vectors (not general elements of the algebra). Since every element of the algebra can be expressed as the sum of products of this form, this defines the exterior product for every pair of elements of the algebra. It follows from the definition that the exterior product forms an [[alternating algebra]].\n\n===Blades, grades, and canonical basis===\nA multivector that is the exterior product of <math>r</math> linearly independent vectors is called a ''blade'', and the blade is said to be a multivector of grade <math>r</math>.{{efn|Grade is a synonym for ''degree'' of a homogeneous element under the [[graded algebra|grading as an algebra]] with the exterior product (a <math>\\mathrm{Z}</math>-grading), and not under the geometric product.{{efn|When referring to grading under the geometric product, the literature generally only focuses on a <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2</math>-grading, meaning the split into even and odd <math>\\mathrm{Z}</math>-grades. <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2</math> is a subgroup of the full <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2{}^n</math>-grading of the geometric product.}}}} From the axioms, with closure, every multivector of the geometric algebra is a sum of blades.\n\nConsider a set of <math>r</math> linearly independent vectors <math>\\{a_1,\\ldots,a_r\\}</math> spanning an <math>r</math>-dimensional subspace of the vector space. With these, we can define a real [[symmetric matrix]]\n\n:<math>[\\mathbf{A}]_{ij}=a_i\\cdot a_j</math>\n\nBy the [[spectral theorem]], <math>\\mathbf{A}</math> can be diagonalized to [[diagonal matrix]] <math>\\mathbf{D}</math> by an [[orthogonal matrix]] <math>\\mathbf{O}</math> via\n\n:<math>\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}[\\mathbf{O}^{\\mathrm{T}}]_{lj}=\\sum_{k,l}[\\mathbf{O}]_{ik}[\\mathbf{O}]_{jl}[\\mathbf{A}]_{kl}=[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij}</math>\n\nDefine a new set of vectors <math>\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\}</math>, known as orthogonal basis vectors, to be those transformed by the orthogonal matrix:\n\n:<math>e_i=\\sum_j[\\mathbf{O}]_{ij}a_j</math>\n\nSince orthogonal transformations preserve inner products, it follows that <math>e_i\\cdot e_j=[\\mathbf{D}]_{ij}</math> and thus the <math>\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_r\\}</math> are perpendicular. In other words, the geometric product of two distinct vectors <math>e_i \\ne e_j</math> is completely specified by their exterior product, or more generally\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{rl}e_1e_2\\cdots e_r &= e_1 \\wedge e_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_r \\\\\n&= \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{1j}a_j\\right) \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{2j}a_j \\right) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\left(\\sum_j [\\mathbf{O}]_{rj}a_j\\right) \\\\\n&= \\det [\\mathbf{O}] a_1 \\wedge a_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_r \\end{array}</math>\n\nTherefore, every blade of grade <math>r</math> can be written as a geometric product of <math>r</math> vectors. More generally, if a degenerate geometric algebra is allowed, then the orthogonal matrix is replaced by a [[block matrix]] that is orthogonal in the nondegenerate block, and the diagonal matrix has zero-valued entries along the degenerate dimensions. If the new vectors of the nondegenerate subspace are [[unit vector|normalized]] according to\n\n:<math>\\hat{e}_i=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{|e_i \\cdot e_i|}}e_i,</math>\n\nthen these normalized vectors must square to <math>+1</math> or <math>-1</math>. By [[Sylvester's law of inertia]], the total number of <math>+1</math>s and the total number of <math>-1</math>s along the diagonal matrix is invariant. By extension, the total number <math>p</math> of these vectors that square to <math>+1</math> and the total number <math>q</math> that square to <math>-1</math> is invariant. (The total number of basis vectors that square to zero is also invariant, and may be nonzero if the degenerate case is allowed.) We denote this algebra <math>\\mathcal{G}(p,q)</math>. For example, <math>\\mathcal G(3,0)</math> models <math>3</math>-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], <math>\\mathcal G(1,3)</math> relativistic [[spacetime]] and <math>\\mathcal G(4,1)</math> a [[conformal geometric algebra]] of a <math>3</math>-dimensional space.\n\nThe set of all possible products of <math>n</math> orthogonal basis vectors with indices in increasing order, including <math>1</math> as the empty product, forms a basis for the entire geometric algebra (an analogue of the [[Poincar\u00e9\u2013Birkhoff\u2013Witt theorem|PBW theorem]]). For example, the following is a basis for the geometric algebra <math>\\mathcal{G}(3,0)</math>:\n:<math>\\{1,e_1,e_2,e_3,e_1e_2,e_1e_3,e_2e_3,e_1e_2e_3\\}</math>\nA basis formed this way is called a '''canonical basis''' for the geometric algebra, and any other orthogonal basis for <math>V</math> will produce another canonical basis. Each canonical basis consists of <math>2^n</math> elements. Every multivector of the geometric algebra can be expressed as a linear combination of the canonical basis elements. If the canonical basis elements are <math>\\{ B_i | i \\in S \\}</math> with <math>S</math> being an index set, then the geometric product of any two multivectors is\n:<math> \\left( \\sum_i \\alpha_i B_i \\right) \\left( \\sum_j \\beta_j B_j \\right) = \\sum_{i,j} \\alpha_i\\beta_j B_i B_j .</math>\n\nThe terminology \"<math>k</math>-vector\" is often encountered to describe multivectors containing elements of only one grade. In higher dimensional space, some such multivectors are not blades (cannot be factored into the outer product of <math>k</math> vectors). By way of example, <math> e_1 \\wedge e_2 + e_3 \\wedge e_4 </math> in <math>\\mathcal{G}(4,0)</math> cannot be factored; typically, however, such elements of the algebra do not yield to any geometric interpretation. Only <math> 0,1,(n-1)</math> and <math>n</math>-vectors are always blades in <math>n</math>-space.\n\n===Grade projection===\n\nUsing an orthogonal basis, a [[graded vector space]] structure can be established. Elements of the geometric algebra that are scalar multiples of <math>1</math> are grade-<math>0</math> blades and are called ''scalars''. Multivectors that are in the span of <math>\\{e_1,\\ldots,e_n\\}</math> are grade-<math>1</math> blades and are the ordinary vectors. Multivectors in the span of <math>\\{e_ie_j\\mid 1\\leq i<j\\leq n\\}</math> are grade-<math>2</math> blades and are the bivectors. This terminology continues through to the last grade of <math>n</math>-vectors. Alternatively, grade-<math>n</math> blades are called [[pseudoscalar]]s, grade-<math>(n-1)</math> blades pseudovectors, etc. Many of the elements of the algebra are not graded by this scheme since they are sums of elements of differing grade. Such elements are said to be of ''mixed grade''. The grading of multivectors is independent of the basis chosen originally.\n\nA multivector <math>A</math> may be decomposed with the '''grade-projection operator''' <math>\\langle A \\rangle _r</math>, which outputs the grade-<math>r</math> portion of <math>A</math>. As a result:\n\n:<math> A = \\sum_{r=0}^{n} \\langle A \\rangle _r </math>\n\nAs an example, the geometric product of two vectors <math> a b = a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b = \\langle a b \\rangle_0 + \\langle a b \\rangle_2</math> since <math>\\langle a b \\rangle_0=a\\cdot b</math> and <math>\\langle a b \\rangle_2 = a\\wedge b</math> and <math>\\langle a b \\rangle_i=0</math>, for <math>i</math> other than <math>0</math> and <math>2</math>.\n\nThe decomposition of a multivector <math>A</math> may also be split into those components that are even and those that are odd:\n\n:<math> A^{+} = \\langle A \\rangle _0 + \\langle A \\rangle _2 + \\langle A \\rangle _4 + \\cdots </math>\n:<math> A^{-} = \\langle A \\rangle _1 + \\langle A \\rangle _3 + \\langle A \\rangle _5 + \\cdots </math>\n\nThis makes the algebra a <math>\\mathrm{Z}_2</math>-[[graded algebra]] or [[superalgebra]] with the geometric product. Since the geometric product of two even multivectors is an even multivector, they define an ''[[even subalgebra]]''. The even subalgebra of an <math>n</math>-dimensional geometric algebra is [[algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]] to a full geometric algebra of <math>(n-1)</math> dimensions. Examples include <math>\\mathcal G^{+}(2,0) \\cong \\mathcal{G}(0,1)</math> and <math>\\mathcal{G}^{+}(1,3) \\cong \\mathcal G(3,0)</math>.\n\n===Representation of subspaces===\nGeometric algebra represents subspaces of <math>V</math> as blades, and so they coexist in the same algebra with vectors from <math>V</math>. A <math>k</math>-dimensional subspace <math>W</math> of <math>V</math> is represented by taking an orthogonal basis <math>\\{b_1,b_2,\\ldots, b_k\\}</math> and using the geometric product to form the [[blade (geometry)|blade]] <math>D = b_1b_2\\cdots b_k</math>. There are multiple blades representing <math>W</math>; all those representing <math>W</math> are scalar multiples of <math>D</math>. These blades can be separated into two sets: positive multiples of <math>D</math> and negative multiples of <math>D</math>. The positive multiples of <math>D</math> are said to have ''the same [[orientation (vector space)|orientation]]'' as <math>D</math>, and the negative multiples the ''opposite orientation''.\n\nBlades are important since geometric operations such as projections, rotations and reflections depend on the factorability via the exterior product that (the restricted class of) <math>n</math>-blades provide but that (the generalized class of) grade-<math>n</math> multivectors do not when <math>n \\ge 4</math>.\n\n===Unit pseudoscalars===\nUnit pseudoscalars are blades that play important roles in GA. A '''unit pseudoscalar''' for a non-degenerate subspace <math>W</math> of <math>V</math> is a blade that is the product of the members of an orthonormal basis for <math>W</math>. It can be shown that if <math>I</math> and <math>I'</math> are both unit pseudoscalars for <math>W</math>, then <math>I = \\pm I'</math> and <math>I^2 = \\pm 1</math>.\n\nSuppose the geometric algebra <math>\\mathcal{G}(n,0)</math> with the familiar positive definite inner product on <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math> is formed. Given a plane (<math>2</math>-dimensional subspace) of <math>\\mathbf{R}^n</math>, one can find an orthonormal basis <math>\\{ b_1, b_2 \\}</math> spanning the plane, and thus find a unit pseudoscalar <math>I = b_1 b_2</math> representing this plane. The geometric product of any two vectors in the span of <math>b_1</math> and <math>b_2</math> lies in <math>\\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>, that is, it is the sum of a <math>0</math>-vector and a <math>2</math>-vector.\n\nBy the properties of the geometric product, <math>I^2 = b_1 b_2 b_1 b_2 = -b_1 b_2 b_2 b_1 = -1</math>. The resemblance to the [[imaginary unit]] is not incidental: the subspace <math> \\{ \\alpha_0 + \\alpha_1 I \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R} \\} </math> is <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>-algebra isomorphic to the [[complex number]]s. In this way, a copy of the complex numbers is embedded in the geometric algebra for each 2-dimensional subspace of <math>V</math> on which the quadratic form is definite.\n\nIt is sometimes possible to identify the presence of an imaginary unit in a physical equation. Such units arise from one of the many quantities in the real algebra that square to <math>-1</math>, and these have geometric significance because of the properties of the algebra and the interaction of its various subspaces.\n\nIn <math>\\mathcal{G}(3,0)</math>, a further familiar case occurs. Given a canonical basis consisting of orthonormal vectors <math>e_i</math> of <math>V</math>, the set of ''all'' <math>2</math>-vectors is spanned by\n:<math> \\{ e_3 e_2 , e_1 e_3 , e_2 e_1 \\} .</math>\nLabelling these <math>i</math>, <math>j</math> and <math>k</math> (momentarily deviating from our uppercase convention), the subspace generated by <math>0</math>-vectors and <math>2</math>-vectors is exactly <math> \\{ \\alpha_0 + i \\alpha_1 + j \\alpha_2 + k \\alpha_3 \\mid \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbf{R}\\}</math>. This set is seen to be a subalgebra of <math>\\mathcal{G}(3,0)</math>, and furthermore is isomorphic as an <math>\\mathbf{R}</math>-algebra to the [[quaternion]]s, another important algebraic system.\n\n===Dual basis===\n\nLet <math>\\{ e_1 , \\ldots , e_n \\}</math> be a basis of <math>V</math>, i.e. a set of <math>n</math> linearly independent vectors that span the <math>n</math>-dimensional vector space <math>V</math>. The basis that is dual to <math>\\{ e_1 , \\ldots , e_n \\}</math> is the set of elements of the [[dual vector space]] <math>V^{*}</math> that forms a [[biorthogonal system]] with this basis, thus being the elements denoted <math>\\{ e^1 , \\ldots , e^n \\}</math> satisfying\n:<math>e^i \\cdot e_j = \\delta^i{}_j,</math>\nwhere <math>\\delta</math> is the [[Kronecker delta]].\n\nGiven a nondegenerate quadratic form on <math>V</math>, <math>V^{*}</math> becomes naturally identified with <math>V</math>, and the dual basis may be regarded as elements of <math>V</math>, but are not in general the same set as the original basis.\n\nGiven further a GA of <math>V</math>, let \n:<math> \\epsilon = e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n</math>\nbe the pseudoscalar (which does not necessarily square to <math>\\pm 1</math>) formed from the basis <math>\\{ e_1 , \\ldots , e_n \\}</math>. The dual basis vectors may be constructed as\n:<math>e^i=(-1)^{i-1}(e_1 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge \\check{e}_i \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge e_n) \\epsilon^{-1},</math>\nwhere the <math>\\check{e}_i</math> denotes that the <math>i</math>th basis vector is omitted from the product.\n\n===Extensions of the inner and exterior products===\n\nIt is common practice to extend the exterior product on vectors to the entire algebra. This may be done through the use of the grade projection operator:\n\n: <math>C \\wedge D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{r+s} </math> &nbsp; &nbsp; (the ''exterior product'')\n\nThis generalization is consistent with the above definition involving antisymmetrization. Another generalization related to the exterior product is the commutator product:\n: <math>C \\times D := \\tfrac{1}{2}(CD-DC) </math>\n\nThe regressive product (usually referred to as the \"meet\") is the dual of the exterior product (or \"join\" in this context).{{efn|...the outer product operation and the join relation have essentially the same meaning. The [[Grassmann\u2013Cayley algebra]] regards the meet relation as its counterpart and gives a unifying framework in which these two operations have equal footing...Grassmann himself defined the meet operation as the dual of the outer product operation, but later mathematicians defined the meet operator independently of the outer product through a process called [[Shuffle algebra|shuffle]], and the meet operation is termed the shuffle product. It is shown that this is an antisymmetric operation that satisfies associativity, defining an algebra in its own right. Thus, the Grassmann\u2013Cayley algebra has two algebraic structures simultaneously:one based on the outer product (or join), the other based on the shuffle product (or meet). Hence, the name \u201cdouble algebra,\u201d and the two are shown to be dual to each other{{sfn|Kanatani|2015|p=112-113}}}} The dual specification of elements permits, for blades <math>A</math> and <math>B</math>, the intersection (or meet) where the duality is to be taken relative to the smallest grade blade containing both <math>A</math> and <math>B</math> (the join).{{sfn|Dorst|Lasenby|2011|p=443}}\n:\n: <math>C \\vee D := ((CI^{-1}) \\wedge (DI^{-1}))I </math>\nwith <math>I</math> the unit pseudoscalar of the algebra. The regressive product, like the exterior product, is associative.{{sfn|Vaz|da Rocha|2016|loc=\u00a72.8}}\n\nThe inner product on vectors can also be generalized, but in more than one non-equivalent way. The paper {{Harvard citation|Dorst|2002}} gives a full treatment of several different inner products developed for geometric algebras and their interrelationships, and the notation is taken from there. Many authors use the same symbol as for the inner product of vectors for their chosen extension (e.g. Hestenes and Perwass). No consistent notation has emerged.\n\nAmong these several different generalizations of the inner product on vectors are:\n\n: <math> C \\;\\rfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{s-r} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the ''left contraction'')\n: <math> C \\;\\lfloor\\; D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{r-s} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the ''right contraction'')\n: <math> C * D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C \\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_s \\rangle_{0} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the ''scalar product'')\n: <math> C \\bullet D := \\sum_{r,s}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{|s-r|} </math> &nbsp;&nbsp;(the \"(fat) dot\" product){{efn|\nThis should not be confused with Hestenes's irregular generalization <math>\\textstyle C \\bullet_H D := \\sum_{r\\ne0,s\\ne0}\\langle \\langle C\\rangle_r \\langle D \\rangle_{s} \\rangle_{|s-r|} </math>, where the distinguishing notation is from {{harvp|Dorst|Fontijne|Mann|2007|loc=\u00a7B.1 p. 590|ps=, which makes the point that scalar components must be handled separately with this product.}}}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Dorst|2002}} makes an argument for the use of contractions in preference to Hestenes's inner product; they are algebraically more regular and have cleaner geometric interpretations. \nA number of identities incorporating the contractions are valid without restriction of their inputs.\nFor example,\n\n:<math> C \\;\\rfloor\\; D = ( C \\wedge ( D I^{-1} ) ) I </math>\n:<math> C \\;\\lfloor\\; D = I ( ( I^{-1} C) \\wedge D ) </math>\n:<math> ( A \\wedge B ) * C = A * ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) </math>\n:<math> C * ( B \\wedge A ) = ( C \\;\\lfloor\\; B ) * A </math> \n:<math> A \\;\\rfloor\\; ( B \\;\\rfloor\\; C ) = ( A \\wedge B ) \\;\\rfloor\\; C </math>\n:<math> ( A \\;\\rfloor\\; B ) \\;\\lfloor\\; C = A \\;\\rfloor\\; ( B \\;\\lfloor\\; C ) .</math>\n\nBenefits of using the left contraction as an extension of the inner product on vectors include that the identity <math> ab = a \\cdot b + a \\wedge b </math> is extended to <math> aB = a \\;\\rfloor\\; B + a \\wedge B</math> for any vector <math>a</math> and multivector <math>B</math>, and that the [[projection (linear algebra)|projection]] operation <math> \\mathcal{P}_b (a) = (a \\cdot b^{-1})b </math> is extended to <math> \\mathcal{P}_B (A) = (A \\;\\rfloor\\; B^{-1}) \\;\\rfloor\\; B</math> for any blade <math>B</math> and any multivector <math>A</math> (with a minor modification to accommodate null <math>B</math>, given [[#Projection and rejection|below]]).\n\n===Linear functions===\nAlthough versors are inherently more useful, they are a subgroup of [[linear function]]s on multivectors and these can still be used when necessary. The geometric algebra of an <math>n</math>-dimensional vector space is spanned by a basis of <math>2^n</math> elements. If a multivector is represented by a <math>2^n \\times 1</math> real [[column matrix]] in terms of a basis, then all linear transformations of the multivector can be expressed as the [[matrix multiplication]] by a <math>2^n \\times 2^n</math> real matrix. However, such a general linear transformation allows arbitrary exchanges among grades, such as a \"rotation\" of a scalar into a vector, which has no evident geometric interpretation.\n\nA general linear transformation from vectors to vectors is of interest. With the natural restriction to preserving the induced exterior algebra, the ''[[outermorphism]]'' of the linear transformation is its unique extension. If <math>f</math> is a linear function that maps vectors to vectors, then its outermorphism is the function that obeys the rule\n:<math>\\underline{\\mathsf{f}}(a_1 \\wedge a_2 \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge a_r) = f(a_1) \\wedge f(a_2) \\wedge \\cdots \\wedge f(a_r)</math>\nfor a blade, extended to the whole algebra through linearity.\n\n==Modeling geometries==\nAlthough a lot of attention has been placed on CGA, it is to be noted that GA is not just one algebra, it is one of a family of algebras with the same essential structure.{{sfn|Dorst|Lasenby|2011|p=vi}}\n\n===Vector space model===\n{{main | Comparison of vector algebra and geometric algebra}}\n<math>\\mathcal G(3,0)</math> may be considered as an extension or completion of [[Vector calculus#Algebraic operations|vector algebra]].

In red are the unit normal vector, and the \"parallel\" unit bivector.]]\n\nThe cross product can be viewed in terms of the exterior product allowing a more natural geometric interpretation of the cross product as a bivector using the [[Hodge dual|dual]] relationship\n\n:<math>a \\times b = -I (a \\wedge b) .</math>\n\nFor example, torque is generally defined as the magnitude of the perpendicular force component times distance, or work per unit angle.\n\nSuppose a circular path in an arbitrary plane containing orthonormal vectors <math>\\hat{u}</math> and <math>\\hat{v}</math> is parameterized by angle.\n\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{r} = r(\\hat{u} \\cos \\theta + \\hat{v} \\sin \\theta) = r \\hat{u}(\\cos \\theta + \\hat{u} \\hat{v} \\sin \\theta)\n</math>\n\nBy designating the unit bivector of this plane as the imaginary number\n\n:<math>{i} = \\hat{u} \\hat{v} = \\hat{u} \\wedge \\hat{v}</math>\n:<math>i^2 = -1 </math>\n\nthis path vector can be conveniently written in complex exponential form\n\n:<math> \\mathbf{r} = r \\hat{ u} e^{i\\theta} </math>\n\nand the derivative with respect to angle is\n\n:<math> \\frac{d \\mathbf{r}}{d\\theta} = r \\hat{u} i e^{i\\theta} = \\mathbf{r} i .</math>\n\nSo the torque, the rate of change of work <math>W</math>, due to a force <math>F</math>, is\n\n:<math> \\tau = \\frac{dW}{d\\theta} = F \\cdot \\frac{dr}{d\\theta} = F \\cdot (\\mathbf{r} i) .</math>\n\nUnlike the cross product description of torque, <math> \\tau = \\mathbf{r} \\times F</math>, the geometric algebra description does not introduce a vector in the normal direction; a vector that does not exist in two and that is not unique in greater than three dimensions. The unit bivector describes the plane and the orientation of the rotation, and the sense of the rotation is relative to the angle between the vectors <math>{\\hat{u}}</math> and <math>{\\hat{v}}</math>.\n\n==Geometric calculus==\n{{main|Geometric calculus}}\n\nGeometric calculus extends the formalism to include differentiation and integration including differential geometry and differential forms.{{sfn|Hestenes|Sobczyk|1984}}\n\nEssentially, the vector derivative is defined so that the GA version of [[Green's theorem]] is true,\n:<math>\\int_A dA \\,\\nabla f = \\oint_{\\partial A} dx \\, f</math>\nand then one can write\n:<math>\\nabla f = \\nabla \\cdot f + \\nabla \\wedge f</math>\nas a geometric product, effectively generalizing [[Stokes' theorem]] (including the differential form version of it).\n\nIn <math>1D</math> when <math>A</math> is a curve with endpoints <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, then\n:<math>\\int_A dA \\,\\nabla f = \\oint_{\\partial A} dx \\, f</math>\nreduces to\n:<math>\\int_a^b dx \\, \\nabla f = \\int_a^b dx \\cdot \\nabla f = \\int_a^b df = f(b) -f(a)</math>\nor the fundamental theorem of integral calculus.\n\nAlso developed are the concept of [[Vector Manifold|vector manifold]] and geometric integration theory (which generalizes Cartan's differential forms).\n\n==History==\n\n;Before the 20th century\n\nAlthough the connection of geometry with algebra dates as far back at least to [[Euclid]]'s ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'' in the third century B.C. (see [[History of elementary algebra#Greek geometric algebra|Greek geometric algebra]]), GA in the sense used in this article was not developed until 1844, when it was used in a ''systematic way'' to describe the geometrical properties and ''transformations'' of a space. In that year, [[Hermann Grassmann]] introduced the idea of a geometrical algebra in full generality as a certain calculus (analogous to the [[propositional calculus]]) that encoded all of the geometrical information of a space.{{sfn|Grassmann|1844}} Grassmann's algebraic system could be applied to a number of different kinds of spaces, the chief among them being [[Euclidean space]], [[affine space]], and [[projective space]]. Following Grassmann, in 1878 [[William Kingdon Clifford]] examined Grassmann's algebraic system alongside the [[quaternions]] of [[William Rowan Hamilton]] in {{Harvard citation|Clifford|1878}}. From his point of view, the quaternions described certain ''transformations'' (which he called ''rotors''), whereas Grassmann's algebra described certain ''properties'' (or ''Strecken'' such as length, area, and volume). His contribution was to define a new product \u2014&nbsp;the ''geometric product''&nbsp;\u2013 on an existing Grassmann algebra, which realized the quaternions as living within that algebra. Subsequently, [[Rudolf Lipschitz]] in 1886 generalized Clifford's interpretation of the quaternions and applied them to the geometry of rotations in <math>n</math> dimensions. Later these developments would lead other 20th-century mathematicians to formalize and explore the properties of the Clifford algebra.\n\nNevertheless, another revolutionary development of the 19th-century would completely overshadow the geometric algebras: that of [[vector analysis]], developed independently by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] and [[Oliver Heaviside]]. Vector analysis was motivated by [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s studies of [[electromagnetism]], and specifically the need to express and manipulate conveniently certain [[differential equation]]s. Vector analysis had a certain intuitive appeal compared to the rigors of the new algebras. Physicists and mathematicians alike readily adopted it as their geometrical toolkit of choice, particularly following the influential 1901 textbook ''[[Vector Analysis]]'' by [[Edwin Bidwell Wilson]], following lectures of Gibbs.\n\nIn more detail, there have been three approaches to geometric algebra: [[quaternion]]ic analysis, initiated by Hamilton in 1843 and geometrized as rotors by Clifford in 1878; geometric algebra, initiated by Grassmann in 1844; and vector analysis, developed out of quaternionic analysis in the late 19th century by Gibbs and Heaviside. The legacy of quaternionic analysis in vector analysis can be seen in the use of <math>i</math>, <math>j</math>, <math>k</math> to indicate the basis vectors of <math>\\mathbf{R}^3</math>: it is being thought of as the purely imaginary quaternions. From the perspective of geometric algebra, [[Quaternion#Quaternions as the even part of C\u21133,0(R)|quaternions can be identified as {{nowrap|<math>G_{1,3}^{+}</math>('''R''')}}]], the even part of the Clifford algebra on Euclidean 3-space, which unifies the three approaches.\n\n;20th century and present\n\nProgress on the study of Clifford algebras quietly advanced through the twentieth century, although largely due to the work of [[abstract algebra]]ists such as [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[Claude Chevalley]]. The ''geometrical'' approach to geometric algebras has seen a number of 20th-century revivals. In mathematics, [[Emil Artin]]'s ''Geometric Algebra''{{sfn|Artin|1957}} discusses the algebra associated with each of a number of geometries, including [[affine geometry]], [[projective geometry]], [[symplectic geometry]], and [[orthogonal geometry]]. In physics, geometric algebras have been revived as a \"new\" way to do classical mechanics and electromagnetism, together with more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and gauge theory.{{sfn|Doran|1994}} [[David Hestenes]] reinterpreted the Pauli and Dirac matrices as vectors in ordinary space and spacetime, respectively, and has been a primary contemporary advocate for the use of geometric algebra.\n\nIn [[computer graphics]] and robotics, geometric algebras have been revived in order to efficiently represent rotations and other transformations. For applications of GA in robotics (screw theory, kinematics and dynamics using versors), computer vision, control and neural computing (geometric learning) see Bayro (2010).\n\n==Software==\nGA is a very application-oriented subject.

He began his professional career at the age of 21 as a [[jazz]] guitarist. Benson uses a [[rest stroke|rest-stroke]] picking technique similar to that of [[gypsy jazz]] players such as [[Django Reinhardt]].\n\nA former [[child prodigy]], Benson first came to prominence in the 1960s, playing [[soul jazz]] with [[Jack McDuff]] and others. He then launched a successful solo career, alternating between jazz, pop, [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] singing, and [[scat singing]]. His album ''[[Breezin']]'' was certified triple-[[music recording sales certification|platinum]], hitting no. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] album chart in 1976.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited| location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| page= 54}}</ref> His concerts were well attended through the 1980s, and he still has a large following.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\"/> Benson has been honored with a [[List of stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame#B|star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early career ===\nBenson was born and raised in the [[Hill District]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"christianebird-bio\">{{cite book |title=The Da Capo Jazz And Blues Lover's Guide to the U.s. |last=Bird |first=Christiane |year=2001 |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |isbn=0306810344 |page=196 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ub99o7hy08QC&pg=PA196&lpg=PA196&dq=Hill+District+George+Benson&source=bl&ots=BI3EDEWk5R&sig=TpmvwxVcMNqvXCqwWuHvO8OkeQU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tSBQUNiSKYXY2QX6nYHwCg&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Hill%20District%20George%20Benson&f=false}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Faith, Health, and Healing in African American Life |last1=Mitchem |first1=Stephanie Y. |last2=Townes |first2=Emilie Maureen |year=2008 |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]] |isbn=0275993752 |page=111 |accessdate=September 8, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dBVTH6F7iGAC&pg=PA111&lpg=PA111&dq=Hill+District+George+Benson&source=bl&ots=A6nXvS9dO6&sig=TmKLcNPUKa_C1vS4-tkhwZeJAyM&hl=en&sa=X&ei=tSBQUNiSKYXY2QX6nYHwCg&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=Hill%20District%20George%20Benson&f=false}}</ref> At the age of seven, he first played the ukulele in a corner drug store, for which he was paid a few dollars. At the age of eight, he played guitar<ref name=\"christianebird-bio\"/> in an unlicensed nightclub on Friday and Saturday nights, but the police soon closed the club down. At the age of 9, he started to record. Out of the four sides he cut, two were released: \"She Makes Me Mad\" backed with \"It Should Have Been Me\",<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> with RCA-Victor in New York; although one source indicates this record was released under the name \"Little Georgie\",<ref name=\"christianebird-bio\"/> the 45rpm label is printed with the name George Benson.

When this was discovered (tied with the failure of his single) his guitar was impounded.

His 1974 release, ''Bad Benson'', climbed to the top spot in the ''Billboard'' jazz chart, while the follow-ups, ''Good King Bad'' (#51 Pop album) and ''Benson and Farrell'' (with Joe Farrell), both reached the jazz top-three sellers. Benson also did a version of [[The Beatles]]'s 1969 album ''[[Abbey Road]]'' called ''[[The Other Side of Abbey Road]]'', also released in 1969, and a version of \"[[White Rabbit (song)|White Rabbit]]\", originally written and recorded by San Francisco rock group Great Society, and made famous by [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\" /> Benson played on numerous sessions for other CTI artists during this time, including [[Freddie Hubbard]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]], notably on the latter's acclaimed album ''Sugar''.\n\n=== 1970s and 1980s ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=George_Benson_-_Breezin.ogg\n|title=George Benson \"Breezin'\" (1976)\n|description=Title track sample from George Benson's ''Breezin\u2032'' album\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nBy the mid-to-late 1970s, as he recorded for [[Warner Bros. Records]], a whole new audience began to discover Benson. With the 1976 release ''[[Breezin']]'', Benson sang a lead vocal on the track \"[[This Masquerade]]\" (notable also for the lush, romantic piano intro and solo by [[Jorge Dalto]]), which became a huge pop hit and won a [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]]. (He had sung vocals infrequently on albums earlier in his career, notably his rendition of \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\" on the ''Other Side of Abbey Road'' album.) The rest of the album is instrumental, including his rendition of the 1975 [[Jose Feliciano]] composition \"Affirmation\".\n\nIn 1976, Benson toured with soul singer [[Minnie Riperton]], who had been diagnosed with terminal breast cancer earlier that year and, in addition, appeared as a guitarist and backup vocalist on [[Stevie Wonder]]'s song \"[[Another Star]]\" from Wonder's album ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]''.  \n\nDuring the same year, 1976, the top selling album 'Breezin' was released on the Warner Brothers label featuring the [[Bobby Womack]] penned title track and the [[Leon Russell]] penned [[This Masquerade]] which is now a jazz standard.  Both tracks won Grammy awards that year and the LP put Benson into the musical limelight both in the USA and in Europe.  Ironically, Benson had been discouraged up until this time, from using his singing skills, mainly as the company decision makers felt he wasn't competent enough vocally, and he should stick to playing the guitar.  It was here that he clearly proved them wrong.  \n\nHe also recorded the original version of \"[[The Greatest Love of All]]\" for the 1977 [[Muhammad Ali]] bio-pic, ''[[The Greatest (1977 film)|The Greatest]]'', which was later covered by [[Whitney Houston]] as \"Greatest Love of All\".<ref name=\"VH1 - Artists bio\"/> During this time Benson recorded with the German conductor [[Claus Ogerman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bjbear71.com/Ogerman/Claus.html |title=The Work of Claus Ogerman |website=Bjbear71.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-02}}</ref> The live take of \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\", recorded a few months later from the 1978 release ''Weekend in L.A.'', also won a Grammy. He has worked with Freddie Hubbard on a number of his albums throughout the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe Qwest record label (a subsidiary of Warner Bros., run by [[Quincy Jones]]) released Benson's breakthrough pop album ''Give Me The Night'', produced by Jones. Benson made it into the pop and R&B top ten with the song \"[[Give Me the Night (George Benson song)|Give Me the Night]]\" (written by former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] keyboardist [[Rod Temperton]]). He had many hit singles such as \"Love All the Hurt Away\", \"Turn Your Love Around\", \"Inside Love\", \"Lady Love Me\", \"20/20\", \"Shiver\", \"Kisses in the Moonlight\".  More importantly, Quincy Jones encouraged Benson to search his roots for further vocal inspiration, and he rediscovered his love for [[Nat Cole]], [[Ray Charles]] and [[Donny Hathaway]] in the process, influencing a string of further vocal albums into the 1990s. Despite returning to his jazz and guitar playing most recently, this theme was reflected again much later in Benson's 2000 release ''Absolute Benson'', featuring a cover of one of Hathaway's most notable songs, \"The Ghetto\". Benson accumulated three other platinum LPs and two gold albums.<ref name=\"VH1 - Artists bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/benson_george_1/bio.jhtml |title=Digital Videos &#124; Episodes (TV Series) |publisher=VH1 |date=2017-03-14 |accessdate=2017-05-02}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s to present ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=George_Benson_-_This_Masquerade.ogg\n|title=George Benson \u2013 \"This Masquerade\"\n|description=Sample track from George Benson's ''Breezin''' album (1976)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\nIn 1990, Benson was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from the [[Berklee College of Music]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NtVbEzSkFfwC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=George+Benson+honorary+doctorate+berklee&source=bl&ots=aB8FnS1Q_7&sig=ChyAWedbMDR_7UeH1-IZ44NU7l8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjN4I29mvjXAhXTySYKHekyBZoQ6AEITjAH#v=onepage&q=George+Benson+honorary+doctorate+berklee&f=false|title=Interviews With the Jazz Greats...and More!|first=CHARLES H.|last=CHAPMAN|date=October 7, 2010|publisher=Mel Bay Publications|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nIn 1985, Benson and guitarist [[Chet Atkins]] went on the [[smooth jazz]] charts with their collaboration \"Sunrise\", one of two songs from the duo released on Atkins' ''[[Stay Tuned (Chet Atkins album)|Stay Tuned]]'' album. In 1992, Benson appeared on [[Jack McDuff]]'s ''Colour Me Blue'' album, his first appearance on a Concord album.

Some languages lack tense, i.e. do not have grammatical time reference, though probably all languages can lexicalize time reference, i.e. have temporal adverbials that locate situations in time.\"</ref> Tenses are usually manifested by the use of specific forms of [[verb]]s, particularly in their [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] patterns. \n\nBasic tenses found in many languages include the [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]]. Some languages have only two distinct tenses, such as past and [[nonpast]], or future and [[Nonfuture tense|nonfuture]]. There are also [[tenseless language]]s, like most of the [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese languages]], though it can possess a future and [[Nonfuture tense|nonfuture]] system, which is typical of Sino-Tibetan languages.<ref>Nick Huang, [http://ling.umd.edu/~znhuang/materials/NACCL27%20proceedings-nhuang-vAug15.pdf \"On syntactic tense in Mandarin Chinese\"] \"Proceedings of the 27th North American Conference on Chinese Linguistics\", Los Angeles, 2015.</ref> On the other hand, some languages make finer tense distinctions, such as remote vs recent past, or near vs remote future.\n\nTenses generally express time relative to the [[TUTT (linguistics)|moment of speaking]]. In some contexts, however, their meaning may be relativized to a point in the past or future which is established in the discourse (the moment being spoken about). This is called [[Relative and absolute tense|''relative'']] (as opposed to ''absolute'') tense. Some languages have different verb forms or constructions which manifest relative tense, such as [[pluperfect]] (\"past-in-the-past\") and \"[[future-in-the-past]]\".\n\nExpressions of tense are often closely connected with expressions of the category of [[grammatical aspect|aspect]]; sometimes what are traditionally called tenses (in languages such as [[Latin]]) may in modern analysis be regarded as combinations of tense with aspect. Verbs are also often conjugated for [[grammatical mood|mood]], and since in many cases the three categories are not manifested separately, some languages may be described in terms of a combined [[tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood]] (TAM) system.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English noun ''tense'' comes from [[Old French]] ''tens'' \"time\" (spelled ''temps'' in modern French through deliberate archaisation), from [[Latin]] {{lang|la|tempus}} \"time\".<ref>{{L&S|tempus|ref}}</ref> It is not related to the adjective ''tense'', which comes from Latin ''tensus'', the [[Latin conjugation#Participles|perfect passive participle]] of ''tendere'' \"stretch\".<ref>{{OEtymD|tense}}</ref>\n\n==Uses of the term==\nIn modern linguistic theory, tense is understood as a category that expresses ([[Grammaticalization|grammaticalizes]]) time reference; namely one which, using [[grammar|grammatical]] means, places a state or action in time.<ref name=\"ELL\" /><ref name=\"Comrie\" /> Nonetheless, in many descriptions of languages, particularly in traditional European grammar, the term \"tense\" is applied to series of verb forms or constructions that express not merely position in time, but also additional properties of the state or action \u2013 particularly aspectual or modal properties.\n\nThe category of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]] expresses how a state or action relates to time \u2013 whether it is seen as a complete event, an ongoing or repeated situation, etc. Many languages make a distinction between [[perfective aspect]] (denoting complete events) and [[imperfective aspect]] (denoting ongoing or repeated situations); some also have other aspects, such as a [[perfect aspect]], denoting a state following a prior event. Some of the traditional \"tenses\" express time reference together with aspectual information. In [[Latin grammar|Latin]] and [[French grammar|French]], for example, the [[imperfect]] denotes past time in combination with imperfective aspect, while other verb forms (the Latin perfect, and the French ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' or ''[[pass\u00e9 simple]]'') are used for past time reference with perfective aspect.\n\nThe category of [[Grammatical mood|mood]] is used to express [[Linguistic modality|modality]], which includes such properties as uncertainty, [[evidentiality]], and obligation. Commonly encountered moods include the [[indicative mood|indicative]], [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]], and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. Mood can be bound up with tense, aspect, or both, in particular verb forms. Hence certain languages are sometimes analysed as having a single [[tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood]] (TAM) system, without separate manifestation of the three categories.\n \nThe term ''tense'', then, particularly in less formal contexts, is sometimes used to denote any combination of tense proper, aspect, and mood. As regards [[English language|English]], there are many [[Uses of English verb forms|verb forms and constructions]] which combine time reference with [[continuous aspect|continuous]] and/or perfect aspect, and with indicative, subjunctive or conditional mood. Particularly in some [[English language teaching]] materials, some or all of these forms can be referred to simply as tenses (see [[#English|below]]).\n\nParticular tense forms need not always carry their basic time-referential meaning in every case. A present tense form may sometimes refer to the past (as in the [[historical present]]), a past tense form may sometimes refer to the non-past (as in some [[English conditional sentences]]), and so on.\n\n==Possible tenses==\n\nNot all languages have tense: [[tenseless language]]s include [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Dyirbal language|Dyirbal]].{{sfn|Comrie|1985|pp=50-53}} Some languages have all three basic tenses (the [[past tense|past]], [[present tense|present]], and [[future tense|future]]), while others have only two: some have past and [[nonpast]] tenses, the latter covering both present and future times (as in [[Arabic]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and in [[English language|English]] in some analyses), whereas others such as [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] and [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] have future and [[Nonfuture tense|nonfuture]]. Some languages have four or more tenses, making finer distinctions either in the past (e.g. remote vs. recent past) or in the future (e.g. near vs. remote future). The six-tense language [[Kalaw Lagaw Ya]] of Australia has the remote past, the recent past, the today past, the present, the today/near future and the remote future.\n\nA historical past tense, used for events perceived as historical, is found in, for example, the Amazonian [[Cubeo language]].<ref>Nancy L. Morse, Michael B. Maxwell, ''Cubeo Grammar'', Summer Institute of Linguistics, 1999, p. 45.</ref>\n\nTenses that refer specifically to \"today\" are called [[hodiernal tense]]s; these can be either past or future. Apart from Kalaw Lagaw Ya, another language which features such tenses is [[Mwera language|Mwera]], a [[Bantu language]] of Tanzania. It is also suggested that in 17th-century French, the ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'' served as a hodiernal past.<ref>Joan Bybee, Revere Perkins, William Pagliuca, ''The Evolution of Grammar: Tense, Aspect, and Modality in the Languages of the World'', University of Chicago Press, 1994, p. 101.</ref> Tenses which contrast with hodiernals, by referring to the past before today or the future after today, are called pre-hodiernal and post-hodiernal respectively. Some languages also have a [[crastinal tense]], a future tense referring specifically to tomorrow (found in some Bantu languages); or a [[hesternal tense]], a past tense referring specifically to yesterday<ref>Daniel Nettle, ''The Fyem Language of Northern Nigeria'', LINCOM Europa 1998</ref> (although this name is also sometimes used to mean pre-hodiernal<ref>Earl W. Stevick, ''Adapting and writing language lessons'', U.S. Foreign Service Institute, 1971, p. 302.</ref>). A tense for after tomorrow is thus called post-crastinal, and one for before yesterday is called pre-hesternal.\n\nAnother tense found in some languages, including [[Luganda]], is the persistive tense, used to indicate that a state or ongoing action is still the case (or, in the negative, is no longer the case). Luganda also has tenses meaning \"so far\" and \"not yet\".\n\nSome languages have special tense forms that are used to express [[relative tense]]. Tenses that refer to the past relative to the time under consideration are called ''anterior''; these include the [[pluperfect]] (for the past relative to a past time) and the [[future perfect]] (for the past relative to a future time). Similarly, ''posterior'' tenses refer to the future relative to the time under consideration, as with the English \"[[future-in-the-past]]\": ''(he said that) he '''would go'''.'' Relative tense forms are also sometimes analysed as combinations of tense with aspect: the [[perfect aspect]] in the anterior case, or the [[prospective aspect]] in the posterior case.\n\n==Tense marking==\n\nTense is normally indicated by the use of a particular verb form \u2013 either an [[inflection|inflected]] form of the main verb, or a [[periphrasis|multi-word construction]], or both in combination. Inflection may involve the use of [[affix]]es, such as the ''-ed'' ending that marks the past tense of [[English verbs|English regular verbs]], but can also entail [[word stem|stem]] modifications, such as [[ablaut]], as found as in the [[Germanic strong verb|strong verb]]s in English and other Germanic languages, or [[reduplication]]. Multi-word tense constructions often involve [[auxiliary verb]]s or [[clitics]]. Examples which combine both types of tense marking include the French ''[[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]]'', which has an auxiliary verb together with the inflected [[past participle]] form of the main verb; and the [[Irish grammar#Verbs|Irish past tense]], where the proclitic ''do'' (in various surface forms) appears in conjunction with the affixed or ablaut-modified past tense form of the main verb.\n\nAs has already been mentioned, indications of tense are often bound up with indications of other verbal categories, such as [[tense-aspect-mood|aspect and mood]]. The [[grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] patterns of verbs often also reflect [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with categories pertaining to the [[subject (grammar)|subject]], such as [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical number|number]] and [[grammatical gender|gender]]. It is consequently not always possible to identify elements that mark any specific category, such as tense, separately from the others.\n\nA few languages have been shown to mark tense information (as well as aspect and mood) on [[noun]]s. This may be called [[nominal TAM]].<ref>Rachel Nordlinger and Louisa Sadler, [http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/LFG/5/lfg00nordlinger-sadler.pdf \"Tense as a Nominal Category\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816155125/http://csli-publications.stanford.edu/LFG/5/lfg00nordlinger-sadler.pdf |date=2012-08-16 }}, ''Proceedings of the LFG00 Conference'', Berkeley, 2000.</ref>\n\nLanguages that do not have grammatical tense, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]], express time reference chiefly by [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] means \u2013 through [[adverbial]]s, time phrases, and so on. (The same is done in tensed languages, to supplement or reinforce the time information conveyed by the choice of tense.) Time information is also sometimes conveyed as a secondary feature by markers of other categories, as with the [[Chinese grammar#Aspect|Chinese aspect markers]] ''le'' and ''guo'', which in most cases place an action in past time. However, much time information is conveyed implicitly by context \u2013 it is therefore not always necessary, when [[translation|translating]] from a tensed to a tenseless language, say, to express explicitly in the target language all of the information conveyed by the tenses in the source.\n\n==In particular languages==\n\n===Latin and Ancient Greek===\n\n[[Latin]] is traditionally described as having six tenses (the Latin for \"tense\" being ''tempus'', plural ''tempora''):\n* [[Present tense|Present]] ''(praesens)''\n* [[Imperfect]] ''(praeteritum imperfectum)''\n* [[Perfect (grammar)|Perfect]] ''(praeteritum perfectum)''\n* [[Future tense|Future]] ''(futurus)''\n* [[Pluperfect]] ''(plus quam perfectum)''\n* [[Future perfect]] ''(anterior futurus)''\nOf these, the imperfect and perfect can be considered to represent a past tense combined with [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[perfective aspect]] respectively (the first is used for habitual or ongoing past actions or states, and the second for completed actions). The pluperfect and future perfect are [[relative tense]]s, referring to the past relative to a past time or relative to a future time.\n\nLatin verbs are conjugated for tense (and aspect) together with [[grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative, subjunctive, and sometimes imperative) and [[grammatical voice|voice]] (active or passive). Most forms are produced by inflecting the verb stem, with endings that also depend on the person and number of the subject. Some of the passive forms are produced using a [[participle]] together with a conjugated [[auxiliary verb]]. For details of the forms, see [[Latin conjugation]].\n\nThe [[Ancient Greek verbs#Tenses|tenses of Ancient Greek]] are similar, but with a three-way aspect contrast in the past: the [[Aorist tense|aorist]], the perfect and the imperfect. The aorist was the \"simple past\", while the imperfective denoted uncompleted action in the past, and the perfect was used for past events having relevance to the present.\n\nThe study of modern languages has been [[History of English grammars|greatly influenced]] by the grammar of the Classical languages, since early grammarians, often monks, had no other reference point to describe their language. Latin terminology is often used to describe modern languages, sometimes with a change of meaning, as with the application of \"perfect\" to forms in English that do not necessarily have perfective meaning, or the words ''Imperfekt'' and ''Perfekt'' to [[German verbs|German past tense forms]] that mostly lack any relationship to the aspects implied by those terms.\n\n===English===\nEnglish has only two [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] tenses: the [[present tense|present]] (or [[non-past tense|non-past]]), as in ''he '''goes''''', and the [[past tense|past]] (or [[preterite]]), as in ''he '''went'''''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}} The non-past usually references the present, but sometimes references the future (as in ''the bus '''leaves''' tomorrow''). (It also sometimes references the past, however, in what is called the [[historical present]].)\n\nConstructions with the [[English modal verbs|modal auxiliary]] verbs [[shall and will|''will'' and ''shall'']] also frequently reference the future (although they have other uses as well); these are often described as the English [[future tense]]. Less commonly, forms with the auxiliaries ''would'' and (rarely) ''should'' are described as a [[relative tense]], the [[future-in-the-past]]. (The same forms are used for the [[conditional mood]], and for various other meanings.)\n\nThe present and past are distinguished by verb form, using either [[ablaut]] (''sing(s)'' ~ ''sang'') or [[suffix]] (''walk(s)'' ~ ''walked''). For details, see [[English verbs]].\n\nEnglish also has [[continuous aspect|continuous]] (progressive) aspect and [[perfect aspect]]; these together produce four aspectual types: simple, continuous, perfect, and perfect continuous. Each of these can combine with the tenses to produce a large set of different constructions, mostly involving one or more [[auxiliary verb]]s together with a [[participle]] or [[infinitive]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\" | \n| colspan=\"4\"| '''Tenses'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\"| '''Morphological'''\n| colspan=\"2\"| '''With auxiliaries'''\n|- \n|'''Present'''\n|'''Past'''\n|'''Future'''\n|'''Future-in-the-past'''\n|-\n|rowspan=\"4\" style=\"valign:center\" | '''Aspects'''\n|'''Simple'''\n|''go(es)''\n|''went''\n|''will go''\n|''would go''\n|-\n|'''Continuous'''\n|''am/is/are going''\n|''was/were going''\n|''will be going''\n|''would be going''\n|-\n|'''Perfect'''\n|''have/has gone''\n|''had gone''\n|''will have gone''\n|''would have gone''\n|-\n|'''Perfect continuous'''\n|''have/has been going''\n|''had been going''\n|''will have been going''\n|''would have been going''\n|}\n\nIn some contexts, particularly in [[English language teaching]], the tense\u2013aspect combinations in the above table may be referred to simply as tenses.<ref>See e.g. Tony Penston, ''A Concise Grammar for English Language Teachers'', TP Publications, 2005, p. 17.</ref> For details of the uses of these constructions, as well as additional verb forms representing different [[grammatical mood]]s, see [[Uses of English verb forms]].\n\n===Other Indo-European languages===\n[[Proto-Indo-European verbs]] had present, perfect ([[stative verb|stative]]), imperfect and aorist forms \u2013 these can be considered as representing two tenses (present and past) with different [[grammatical aspect|aspects]]. Most languages in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family have developed systems either with two morphological tenses (present or \"non-past\", and past) or with three (present, past and future). The tenses often form part of entangled [[tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood]] conjugation systems. Additional tenses, tense\u2013aspect combinations, etc. can be provided by compound constructions containing auxiliary verbs.\n\nThe [[Germanic languages]] (which include English) have present (non-past) and past tenses formed morphologically, with future and other additional forms made using auxiliaries. In standard [[German language|German]], the compound past ''([[German verbs|Perfekt]])'' has replaced the simple morphological past in most contexts.\n\nThe [[Romance languages]] (descendants of Latin) have past, present and future morphological tenses, with additional aspectual distinction in the past. [[French language|French]] is an example of a language where, as in German, the simple morphological perfective past ''([[pass\u00e9 simple]])'' has mostly given way to a compound form ''([[pass\u00e9 compos\u00e9]])''.\n\n[[Irish language|Irish]], a [[Celtic language]], has past, present and future tenses (see [[Irish conjugation]]). The past contrasts perfective and imperfective aspect, and some verbs retain such a contrast in the present. [[Classical Irish]] had a three-way aspectual contrast of simple\u2013perfective\u2013imperfective in the past and present tenses.\n\n[[Persian language|Persian]], an [[Indo-Iranian language]], has past and non-past forms, with additional aspectual distinctions. Future can be expressed using an auxiliary, but almost never in non-formal context.\n\nIn the [[Slavic languages]], verbs are [[Grammatical aspect#Slavic languages|intrinsically]] perfective or imperfective. In [[Russian language|Russian]] and some other languages in the group, perfective verbs have past and future tenses, while imperfective verbs have past, present and future, the imperfective future being a compound tense in most cases. The future tense of perfective verbs is formed in the same way as the present tense of imperfective verbs. However, in [[South Slavic languages]], there may be a greater variety of forms \u2013 [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], for example, has present, past (both \"imperfect\" and \"aorist\") and future tenses, for both perfective and imperfective verbs, as well as [[perfect aspect|perfect]] forms made with an auxiliary (see [[Bulgarian verbs]]).\n\n===Other languages===\n[[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], both members of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, have morphological present (non-past) and past tenses. The [[Hungarian verbs|Hungarian verb]] ''van'' (\"to be\") also has a future form.\n\n[[Turkish grammar|Turkish verbs]] conjugate for past, present and future, with a variety of aspects and moods.\n\n[[Arabic verbs]] have past and non-past; future can be indicated by a prefix.\n\n[[Korean verbs]] have a variety of affixed forms which can be described as representing present, past and future tenses, although they can alternatively be considered to be aspectual. Similarly, [[Japanese verbs]] are described as having present and past tenses, although they may be analysed as aspects. [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and many other East Asian languages generally lack inflection and are considered to be [[tenseless language]]s, although they may have aspect markers which convey certain information about time reference.\n\nFor examples of languages with a greater variety of tenses, see the section on [[#Possible tenses|possible tenses]], above. Fuller information on tense formation and usage in particular languages can be found in the articles on those languages and their grammars.\n\n=== Austronesian languages ===\n\n==== Rapa ====\n\n[[Rapa language|Rapa]] is the French Polynesian language of the island of [[Rapa Iti]].<ref name=\"Walworth, Mary E 2015\">Walworth, Mary E.

The language uses the same words for all three tenses; the phrase E liliu mai au i te Aho T\u014dnai literally translates to Come back / me / on Saturday, but the translation becomes \u2018I am coming back on Saturday\u2019.<ref>''Tau Gana Tokelau''. 1st ed.

Wuvulu contains three verbal markers to indicate sequence of events. The preverbal adverbial ''lo\u0294o'' 'first' indicates the verb occurs before any other. The postverbal morpheme ''liai'' and ''linia'' are the respective intransitive and transitive suffixes indicating a repeated action.

[[Perfective]] aspect is used in referring to an event conceived as [[boundedness (linguistics)|bounded]] and unitary, without reference to any flow of time during (\"I helped him\"). [[Imperfective]] aspect is used for situations conceived as existing continuously or repetitively as time flows (\"I was helping him\"; \"I used to help people\").\n\nFurther distinctions can be made, for example, to distinguish [[stative verb|states]] and ongoing actions ([[continuous and progressive aspects]]) from repetitive actions ([[habitual aspect]]).\n\nCertain aspectual distinctions express a relation in time between the event and the time of reference. This is the case with the [[Perfect (grammar)#Perfect as aspect|perfect aspect]], which indicates that an event occurred prior to (but has continuing relevance at) the time of reference: \"I have eaten\"; \"I had eaten\"; \"I will have eaten\".<ref>Henk J. Verkuyl, Henriette De Swart, Angeliek Van Hout, ''Perspectives on Aspect'', Springer 2006, p. 118.</ref>\n\nDifferent languages make different grammatical aspectual distinctions; some (such as [[Standard German]]; see [[#German vernacular and colloquial|below]]) do not make any. The marking of aspect is often conflated with the marking of [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]] (see [[tense\u2013aspect\u2013mood]]). Aspectual distinctions may be restricted to certain tenses: in [[Latin]] and the [[Romance languages]], for example, the perfective\u2013imperfective distinction is marked in the [[past tense]], by the division between [[preterite]]s and [[imperfect]]s. Explicit consideration of aspect as a category first arose out of study of the [[Slavic languages]]; here verbs often occur in pairs, with two related verbs being used respectively for imperfective and perfective meanings.\n\nThe concept of grammatical aspect should not be confused with [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[imperfect]] ''verb forms''; the meanings of the latter terms are somewhat different, and in some languages, the common names used for verb forms may not follow the actual aspects precisely.\n\n==Basic concept==\n\n===History===\nThe Indian linguist [[Yaska]] (ca. 7th century BCE) dealt with grammatical aspect, distinguishing actions that are processes (''bh\u0101va''), from those where the action is considered as a completed whole (''m\u016brta''). This is the key distinction between the imperfective and perfective. Yaska also applied this distinction to a verb versus an action nominal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\nGrammarians of the Greek and Latin languages also showed an interest in aspect, but the idea did not enter into the modern Western grammatical tradition until the 19th century via the study of the grammar of the [[Slavic languages]]. The earliest use of the term recorded in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] dates from 1853.<ref name=\"Binnick1991\">\n{{cite book|author=Robert I. Binnick|title=Time and the verb: a guide to tense and aspect|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1fSUowGY8kC&pg=PA135|year=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press US|isbn=978-0-19-506206-9|pages=135\u20136 |accessdate=12 August 2011}}\n</ref>\n\n===Modern usage===\nAspect is often confused with the closely related concept of [[Grammatical tense|tense]], because they both convey information about time. While tense relates the time of [[referent]] to some other time, commonly the speech event, aspect conveys other temporal information, such as duration, completion, or frequency, as it relates to the time of action. Thus tense refers to ''temporally when'' while aspect refers to ''temporally how''. Aspect can be said to describe the texture of the time in which a situation occurs, such as a single point of time, a continuous range of time, a sequence of discrete points in time, etc., whereas tense indicates its location in time.\n\nFor example, consider the following sentences: \"I eat\", \"I am eating\", \"I have eaten\", and \"I have been eating\". All are in the [[present tense]], indicated by the present-tense verb of each sentence (''eat'', ''am'', and ''have''). Yet since they differ in aspect each conveys different information or points of view as to how the action pertains to the present.\n\nGrammatical aspect is a ''formal'' property of a [[language]], distinguished through overt [[inflection]], derivational affixes, or independent words that serve as grammatically required [[marker (linguistics)|marker]]s of those aspects. For example, the [[K'iche' language]] spoken in Guatemala has the inflectional prefixes ''k''- and ''x''- to mark incompletive and completive aspect;<ref name=\"pye1\">{{cite journal | journal=Kansas Working Papers in Linguistics | editors=Stacey Stowers, Nathan Poell | volume=26 | year=2008 | last=Pye | first=Clifton | publisher=University of Kansas |title=Mayan Morphosyntax}}</ref><ref name=\"pye2\">Pye, Clifton (2001). \"The Acquisition of Finiteness in K'iche' Maya\".

Even languages that do not mark aspect [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] or through [[auxiliary verb]]s, however, can convey such distinctions by the use of adverbs or other [[Syntax|syntactic]] constructions.<ref name=\"gabriele\">{{cite journal | last=Gabriele | first=Alison | title=Transfer and Transition in the L2 Acquisition of Aspect | year=2008 | journal=Studies in Second Language Acquisition | pages=6}}</ref>\n\nGrammatical aspect is distinguished from [[lexical aspect]] or ''aktionsart'', which is an inherent feature of verbs or verb phrases and is determined by the nature of the situation that the verb describes.\n\n==Common aspectual distinctions==\nThe most fundamental aspectual distinction, represented in many languages, is between perfective aspect and imperfective aspect. This is the basic aspectual distinction in the Slavic languages. It semantically corresponds to the distinction between the [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological forms]] known respectively as the [[aorist]] and imperfect in [[Greek language|Greek]], the preterite and imperfect in Spanish, the [[simple past]] (pass\u00e9 simple) and imperfect in French, and the perfect and imperfect in Latin (from the Latin \"perfectus\", meaning \"completed\").\n\nEssentially, the perfective aspect looks at an event as a complete action, while the imperfective aspect views an event as the process of unfolding or a repeated or habitual event (thus corresponding to the progressive/continuous aspect for events of short-term duration and to habitual aspect for longer terms). For events of short durations in the past, the distinction often coincides with the distinction in the English language between the simple past \"X-ed,\" as compared to the progressive \"was X-ing\" (compare \"I wrote the letters this morning\" (i.e. finished writing the letters: an action completed and \"I was writing letters this morning\"). In describing longer time periods, English needs context to maintain the distinction between the habitual (\"I called him often in the past\" \u2013 a habit that has no point of completion) and perfective (\"I called him once\" \u2013 an action completed), although the construct \"used to\" marks both habitual aspect and past tense and can be used if the aspectual distinction otherwise is not clear.\n\nSometimes, English has a lexical distinction where other languages may use the distinction in grammatical aspect. For example, the English verbs \"to know\" (the state of knowing) and \"to find out\" (knowing viewed as a \"completed action\") correspond to the imperfect and perfect forms of the equivalent verbs in French and Spanish, \"savoir\" and \"saber\". This is also true when the sense of verb \"to know\" is \"to know somebody\", in this case opposed in aspect to the verb \"to meet\" (or even to the construction \"to get to know\"). These correspond to imperfect and perfect forms of \"conocer\" in Spanish. In German, on the other hand, the distinction is also lexical (as in English) through verbs \"kennen\" and \"kennenlernen\", although the semantic relation between both forms is much more straightforward since \"kennen\" means \"to know\" and \"lernen\" means \"to learn\".\n\n==Aspect vs. tense==\nThe [[Germanic languages]] combine the concept of aspect with the concept of [[grammatical tense|tense]]. Although English largely separates tense and aspect formally, its aspects (neutral, progressive, perfect, progressive perfect, and [in the past tense] habitual) do not correspond very closely to the distinction of [[perfective and imperfective|perfective vs. imperfective]] that is found in most languages with aspect. Furthermore, the separation of tense and aspect in English is not maintained rigidly. One instance of this is the alternation, in some forms of English, between sentences such as \"Have you eaten?\" and \"Did you eat?\". Another is in the [[pluperfect]] (\"I had eaten\"), which sometimes represents the combination of past tense and perfect (\"I was full because I had already eaten\"), but sometimes simply represents a past action that is anterior to another past action (\"A little while after I had eaten, my friend arrived\"). (The latter situation is often represented in other languages by a simple perfective tense. Formal Spanish and French use a [[Relative and absolute tense|past anterior]] tense in cases such as this.)\n\nLike tense, aspect is a way that verbs represent time. However, rather than locating an event or state '''in''' time, the way tense does, aspect describes \"the internal temporal constituency of a situation\", or in other words, aspect is a way \"of conceiving the flow of the process itself\".<ref name=Comrie>Bernard Comrie, 1976. ''Aspect.'' Cambridge University Press</ref> English aspectual distinctions in the past tense include \"I went, I used to go, I was going, I had gone\"; in the present tense \"I lose, I am losing, I have lost, I have been losing, I am going to lose\"; and with the future modal \"I will see, I will be seeing, I will have seen, I am going to see\". What distinguishes these aspects within each tense is not (necessarily) when the event occurs, but how the time in which it occurs is viewed: as complete, ongoing, consequential, planned, etc.\n\nIn most dialects of Ancient Greek, aspect is indicated uniquely by verbal morphology. For example, the very frequently used [[aorist]], though a functional [[preterite]] in the indicative mood, conveys historic or 'immediate' aspect in the subjunctive and optative. The perfect in all moods is used as an aspectual marker, conveying the sense of a resultant state. E.g. {{lang|grc|\u1f41\u03c1\u03ac\u03c9}} \u2013 I see (present); {{lang|grc|\u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd}} \u2013 I saw (aorist); {{lang|grc|\u03bf\u1f36\u03b4\u03b1}} \u2013 I am in a state of having seen = I know (perfect).\n\nMany Sino-Tibetan languages, like [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], lack grammatical tense but are rich in aspect{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.\n\n==Lexical vs. grammatical aspect==\n{{Main|Lexical aspect}}\nThere is a distinction between grammatical aspect, as described here, and [[lexical aspect]]. Lexical aspect is an inherent property of a verb or verb-complement phrase, and is not marked formally. The distinctions made as part of lexical aspect are different from those of grammatical aspect. Typical distinctions are between states (\"I owned\"), activities (\"I shopped\"), accomplishments (\"I painted a picture\"), achievements (\"I bought\"), and punctual, or [[semelfactive]], events (\"I sneezed\"). These distinctions are often relevant syntactically. For example, states and activities, but not usually achievements, can be used in English with a prepositional ''for''-phrase describing a time duration: \"I had a car for five hours\", \"I shopped for five hours\", but not \"*I bought a car for five hours\". Lexical aspect is sometimes called ''[[Lexical aspect|Aktionsart]]'', especially by German and [[Slavist|Slavic]] linguists. Lexical or situation aspect is marked in [[Athabaskan languages]].\n\nOne of the factors in situation aspect is [[telicity]]. Telicity might be considered a kind of lexical aspect, except that it is typically not a property of a verb in isolation, but rather a property of an entire verb ''phrase''. Achievements, accomplishments and [[semelfactive]]s have telic situation aspect, while states and activities have atelic situation aspect.\n\nThe other factor in situation aspect is duration, which is also a property of a verb phrase. Accomplishments, states, and activities have duration, while achievements and semelfactives do not.\n\n==Indicating aspect==\nIn some languages, aspect and time are very clearly separated, making them much more distinct to their speakers. There are a number of languages that mark aspect much more saliently than time. Prominent in this category are Chinese and [[American Sign Language]], which both differentiate many aspects but rely exclusively on optional time-indicating terms to pinpoint an action with respect to time. In other language groups, for example in most modern [[Indo-European languages]] (except [[Slavic languages]]), aspect has become almost entirely conflated, in the verbal morphological system, with time.\n\nIn [[Russian language|Russian]], aspect is more salient than tense in narrative. Russian, like other Slavic languages, uses different lexical entries for the different aspects, whereas other languages mark them [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]], and still others with [[auxiliary verb|auxiliaries]] (e.g., English).\n\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic|literary Arabic]] ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u064f\u0635\u0652\u062d\u064e\u0649\u200e}} ''al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101'') the verb has two aspect-tenses: perfective (past), and imperfective (non-past). There is some disagreement among grammarians whether to view the distinction as a distinction in aspect, or tense, or both. The past verb ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064e\u0627\u0636\u0650\u064a\u200e\u200e}} ''al-fi\u02bfl al-m\u0101\u1e0d\u012b'') denotes an event ({{lang|ar|\u062d\u064e\u062f\u064e\u062b}} ''\u1e25ada\u1e6f'') completed in the past, but it says nothing about the relation of this past event to present status. For example, {{lang|ar|\u0648\u064e\u0635\u064e\u0644\u064e}} ''wa\u1e63ala'', \"arrived\", indicates that arrival occurred in the past without saying anything about the present status of the arriver \u2013 maybe they stuck around, maybe they turned around and left, etc. \u2013 nor about the aspect of the past event except insofar as completeness can be considered aspectual. This past verb is clearly similar if not identical to the Greek aorist, which is considered a tense but is more of an aspect marker. In the Arabic, aorist aspect is the logical consequence of past tense. By contrast, the \"Verb of Similarity\" ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0652\u0641\u0650\u0639\u0652\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0636\u064e\u0627\u0631\u0650\u0639\u200e}} ''al-fi\u02bfl al-mu\u1e0d\u0101ri\u02bf''), so called because of its resemblance to the active participial noun, is considered to denote an event in the present or future without committing to a specific aspectual sense beyond the incompleteness implied by the tense: {{lang|ar|\u064a\u064e\u0636\u0652\u0631\u0650\u0628\u064f\u200e}} (''ya\u1e0dribu'', he strikes/is striking/will strike/etc.). Those are the only two \"tenses\" in Arabic (not counting {{lang|ar|\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0652\u0631}} ''amr'', command or imperative, which the tradition counts as denoting future events.) At least that's the way the tradition sees it. To explicitly mark aspect, Arabic uses a variety of lexical and syntactic devices.\n\nContemporary Arabic dialects are another matter. One major change from al-fu\u1e63\u1e25\u0101 is the use of a prefix particle ({{lang|ar|\u0628\u0650}} ''bi'' in Egyptian and Levantine dialects -- though it may have a slightly different range of functions in each dialect) to explicitly mark progressive, continuous, or habitual aspect: {{lang|ar|\u0628\u064a\u0643\u062a\u0628}}, ''bi-yiktib'', he is now writing, writes all the time, etc.\n\nAspect can mark the stage of an action. The [[prospective aspect]] is a combination of tense and aspect that indicates the action is in preparation to take place. The inceptive aspect identifies the beginning stage of an action (e.g. [[Esperanto]] uses ''[[wikt:ek-|ek-]]'', e.g. ''Mi ekman\u011das'', \"I am beginning to eat\".) and inchoative and ingressive aspects identify a change of state (''The flowers started blooming'') or the start of an action (''He started running''). Aspects of stage continue through progressive, pausative, resumptive, cessive, and terminative.\n\nImportant qualifications:\n\n*Although the perfective is often thought of as representing a \"momentary action\", this is not strictly correct. It can equally well be used for an action that took time, as long as it is ''conceived of'' as a unit, with a clearly defined start and end, such as \"Last summer I visited France\".\n*Grammatical aspect represents a formal distinction encoded in the grammar of a language. Although languages that are described as having imperfective and perfective aspects agree in most cases in their use of these aspects, they may not agree in every situation. For example:\n**Some languages have additional grammatical aspects. Spanish and Ancient Greek, for example, have a [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] (not the same as the perfective), which refers to a state resulting from a previous action (also described as a previous action with relevance to a particular time, or a previous action viewed from the perspective of a later time). This corresponds (roughly) to the \"have X-ed\" construction in English, as in \"I have recently eaten\". Languages that lack this aspect (such as Portuguese, which is closely related to Spanish) often use the past perfective to render the present perfect (compare the roughly synonymous English sentences \"Have you eaten yet?\" and \"Did you eat yet?\").\n**In some languages, the formal representation of aspect is optional, and can be omitted when the aspect is clear from context or does not need to be emphasized. This is the case, for example, in Mandarin Chinese, with the perfective suffix ''le'' and (especially) the imperfective ''zhe''.\n**For some verbs in some languages, the difference between perfective and imperfective conveys an additional meaning difference; in such cases, the two aspects are typically translated using separate verbs in English. In Greek, for example, the imperfective sometimes adds the notion of \"try to do something\" (the so-called ''conative imperfect''); hence, the same verb, in the imperfective (present or imperfect) and aorist, respectively, is used to convey ''look'' and ''see'', ''search'' and ''find'', ''listen'' and ''hear''. (For example, \u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bf\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (''\u0113kouomen'', \"we listened\") vs. \u03b7\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd (''\u0113kousamen'', \"we heard\").) Spanish has similar pairs for certain verbs, such as (imperfect and preterite, respectively) ''sab\u00eda'' (\"I knew\") vs. ''supe'' (\"I found out\"), ''pod\u00eda'' (\"I was able to\") vs. ''pude'' (\"I succeeded (in doing something)\"), ''quer\u00eda'' (\"I wanted to\") vs. ''quise'' (\"I tried to\"), and ''no quer\u00eda'' (\"I did not want to\") vs. ''no quise'' (\"I refused (to do something)\"). Such differences are often highly language-specific.\n\n==By language==\n\n===Germanic languages===\n\n====English====\n\nThe English tense\u2013aspect system has two morphologically distinct tenses, present and past. No marker of a future tense exists on the verb in English; the futurity of an event may be expressed through the use of the [[auxiliary verb]]s \"[[will future|will]]\" and \"[[shall]]\", by a present form plus an [[adverb]], as in \"tomorrow we go to New York City\", or by some other means. Past is distinguished from present\u2013future, in contrast, with internal modifications of the verb. These two tenses may be modified further for [[progressive aspect]] (also called ''continuous'' aspect), for the [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], or for both. These two aspectual forms are also referred to as BE +ING<ref>See, for example, {{cite journal | title=Why ''swimming'' is just as difficult as ''dying'' for Japanese learners of English | last=Gabriele | first=Allison | year=2003 | url=https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/tionin/www/MyDownloads/gabriele_2003.pdf | last2=McClure | first2=William | journal=ZAS Papers in Linguistics | volume=29 | page=1 | format=}} {{Dead link|date=May 2010}}</ref> and HAVE +EN,<ref>See, for example, {{cite journal | title=Some Structural Analogies between Tenses and Pronouns in English | last=Partee | first=Barbara H | journal=Journal of Philosophy | volume=70 | issue=18 | year=1973 | page=601 | jstor=2025024 | publisher=Journal of Philosophy, Inc. | doi=10.2307/2025024}}</ref> respectively, which avoids what may be unfamiliar terminology.\n\nAspects of the present tense:\n* [[Present simple]] (not progressive, not perfect): \"I eat\"\n* [[Present progressive]] (progressive, not perfect): \"I am eating\"\n* [[Present perfect]] (not progressive, perfect): \"I have eaten\"\n* [[Present perfect progressive]] (progressive, perfect): \"I have been eating\"\n(While many elementary discussions of English grammar classify the present perfect as a past tense, it relates the action to the present time. One cannot say of someone now deceased that he \"has eaten\" or \"has been eating\". The present auxiliary implies that he is in some way ''present'' (alive), even if the action denoted is completed (perfect) or partially completed (progressive perfect).)\n\nAspects of the past tense:\n* [[Past simple]] (not progressive, not perfect): \"I ate\"\n* [[Past progressive]] (progressive, not perfect): \"I was eating\"\n* [[Past perfect]] (not progressive, perfect): \"I had eaten\"\n* [[Past perfect progressive]] (progressive, perfect): \"I had been eating\"\n\nAspects can also be marked on [[non-finite verb|non-finite]] forms of the verb: \"(to) be eating\" ([[infinitive]] with progressive aspect), \"(to) have eaten\" (infinitive with perfect aspect), \"having eaten\" ([[present participle]] or [[gerund]] with perfect aspect), etc. The perfect infinitive can further be governed by [[English modal verbs|modal verbs]] to express various meanings, mostly combining modality with past reference: \"I should have eaten\" etc. In particular, the modals ''will'' and ''shall'' and their subjunctive forms ''would'' and ''should'' are used to combine future or hypothetical reference with aspectual meaning: \n* [[Simple future]], [[simple conditional]]: \"I will eat\", \"I would eat\"\n* [[Future progressive]], [[conditional progressive]]: \"I will be eating\", \"I would be eating\"\n* [[Future perfect]], [[conditional perfect]]: \"I will have eaten\", \"I would have eaten\"\n* [[Future perfect progressive]], [[conditional perfect progressive]]: \"I will have been eating\", \"I would have been eating\"\n\nThe uses of the progressive and perfect aspects are quite complex. They may refer to the viewpoint of the speaker:\n\n:I was walking down the road when I met Michael Jackson's lawyer. (Speaker viewpoint in middle of action)\n:I have traveled widely, but I have never been to [[Moscow]]. (Speaker viewpoint at end of action)\n\nBut they can have other [[illocutionary act|illocutionary forces]] or additional modal components:\n\n:You are being stupid now. (You are doing it deliberately)\n:You are not having chocolate with your sausages! (I forbid it)\n:I am having lunch with Mike tomorrow. (It is decided)\n\nFor further discussion of the uses of the various tense\u2013aspect combinations, see [[Uses of English verb forms]].\n\nEnglish expresses some other aspectual distinctions with other constructions. ''[[Used to]]'' + VERB is a past [[Habitual aspect|habitual]], as in \"I used to go to school,\" and ''[[going to]] / gonna'' + VERB is a [[prospective aspect|prospective]], a future situation highlighting current intention or expectation, as in \"I'm going to go to school next year.\"\n\nNote that the aspectual systems of certain dialects of English, such as [[African-American Vernacular English]] (see for example [[habitual be]]), and of [[English-based creole language|creoles]] based on English vocabulary, such as [[Hawaiian Creole English]], are quite different from those of standard English, and often distinguish aspect at the expense of tense.\n\n==== German vernacular and colloquial ====\nAlthough [[Standard German]] does not have aspects, many [[Upper German languages]], all [[West Central German]] languages, and some more vernacular German languages do make one aspectual distinction, and so do the colloquial languages of many regions, the so-called German [[regiolect]]s. While officially discouraged in schools and seen as 'bad language', local English teachers like the distinction, because it corresponds well with the English [[continuous aspect|continuous form]]. It is formed by the conjugated auxiliary verb ''sein'' (\"to be\") followed by the preposition \"am\" and the infinitive, or the nominalized verb. The latter two are phonetically indistinguishable; in writing, capitalization differs: \"Ich war am essen\" vs. \"Ich war am Essen\" (I was eating, compared to the Standard German approximation: \"Ich war beim Essen\"); yet these forms are not standardized and thus are relatively infrequently written down or printed, even in quotations or direct speech.\n\nIn the Tyrolean and other Bavarian regiolect the prefix *da can be found, which form perfective aspects. \"I hu's gleant\" (Ich habe es gelernt = I learnt it) vs. \"I hu's daleant\" (*Ich habe es DAlernt = I succeeded in learning).\n\n==== Dutch ====\nIn [[Dutch language|Dutch]] (a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]]), two types of [[continuous aspect|continuous form]] are used. Both types are considered Standard Dutch.\n\nThe first type is very similar to the non-standard German type. It is formed by the conjugated auxiliary verb ''zijn'' (\"to be\"), followed by ''aan het'' and the [[gerund]] (which in Dutch matches the infinitive). For example:\n\n* [[Present progressive]]: ''Ik ben aan het werken'' (\"I am working\")\n* [[Past progressive]]: ''Ik was aan het werken'' (\"I was working\")\n* [[Future progressive]]: ''Ik zal aan het werken zijn'' (\"I will be working\")\n\nThe second type is formed by one of the conjugated auxiliary verbs ''liggen'' (\"to lie\"), ''zitten'' (\"to sit\"), ''hangen'' (\"to hang\"), ''staan'' (\"to stand\") or ''lopen'' (\"to walk\"), followed by the preposition ''te'' and the infinitive. The conjugated verbs indicate the stance of the subject performing or undergoing the action.\n\n* [[Present progressive]]: ''Ik zit te eten'' (\"I am eating [while sitting]\"), ''De was hangt te drogen'' (\"The laundry is drying [while hanging]\")\n* [[Past progressive]]: ''Ik lag te lezen'' (\"I was reading [while lying]\"), ''Ik stond te kijken'' (\"I was watching [while standing]\")\n* [[Future progressive]]: ''Ik zal zitten werken'' (\"I will be working [while sitting]\")\n\nSometimes the meaning of the auxiliary verb is diminished to 'being engaged in'. Take for instance these examples:\n\n* ''De leraar zit steeds te zeggen dat we moeten luisteren'' (\"The teacher keeps telling us to listen\")\n* ''Iedereen loopt te beweren dat het goed was'' (\"Everyone keeps on saying that it was good\")\n* ''Zit niet zo te zeuren'' (\"Stop whining\")\n\nIn these cases, there is generally an undertone of irritation.\n\n===Slavic languages===\n{{main|Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages}}\nThe [[Slavic languages]] make a clear distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects; it was in relation to these languages that the modern concept of aspect originally developed.\n\nIn Slavic languages, a given verb is, in itself, either perfective or imperfective. Consequently each language contains many pairs of verbs, corresponding to each other in meaning, except that one expresses perfective aspect and the other imperfective. (This may be considered a form of [[lexical aspect]].) Perfective verbs are commonly formed from imperfective ones by the addition of a prefix, or else the imperfective verb is formed from the perfective one by modification of the stem or ending. [[Suppletion]] also plays a small role. Perfective verbs cannot generally be used with the meaning of a present tense \u2013 their present-tense forms in fact have future reference. An example of such a pair of verbs, from [[Polish language|Polish]], is given below:\n*Infinitive (and [[dictionary form]]): ''pisa\u0107'' (\"to write\", imperfective); ''napisa\u0107'' (\"to write\", perfective)\n*Present/simple future tense: ''pisze'' (\"writes\"); ''napisze'' (\"will write\", perfective)\n*Compound future tense (imperfective only): ''b\u0119dzie pisa\u0107'' (\"will write, will be writing\")\n*Past tense: ''pisa\u0142'' (\"was writing, used to write, wrote\", imperfective); ''napisa\u0142'' (\"wrote\", perfective)\n\nIn at least the East Slavic and West Slavic languages, there is a three-way aspect differentiation for verbs of motion, with two forms of imperfective, determinate and indeterminate, and one form of perfective. The two forms of imperfective can be used in all three tenses (past, present, and future), but the perfective can only be used with past and future. The indeterminate imperfective expresses [[habitual aspect]] (or motion in no single direction), while the determinate imperfective expresses [[progressive aspect]]. The difference corresponds closely to that between the English \"I (regularly) go to school\" and \"I am going to school (now)\". The three-way difference is given below for the [[Russian grammar#Verbs of Motion|Russian basic (unprefixed) verbs of motion]]. When [[prefix]]es are attached to Russian verbs of motion, they become more or less normal imperfective/perfective pairs, although the prefixes are generally attached to the indeterminate imperfective to form the prefixed imperfective and to the determinate imperfective to form the prefixed perfective.

This derives directly from the way the [[Latin language]] used to render both aspects and ''[[consecutio temporum]]''.\n\nItalian language example using the verb ''mangiare'' (\"to eat\"):\n\nMood: ''indicativo'' (indicative)\n\n*''Presente'' (present): io mangio (\"I eat\", \"I'm eating\") \u2013 merges habitual and continuous aspects, among others\n*''Passato prossimo'' (recent past): io ho mangiato (\"I ate\", \"I have eaten\") \u2013 merges perfective and perfect\n*''Imperfetto'' (imperfect): io mangiavo (\"I was eating\", or \"I usually ate\") \u2013 merges habitual and progressive aspects\n*''Trapassato prossimo'' (recent pluperfect): io avevo mangiato (\"I had eaten\") \u2013 tense, not ordinarily marked for aspect\n*''Passato remoto'' (far past): io mangiai (\"I ate\") \u2013 perfective aspect\n*''Trapassato remoto'' (far pluperfect): io ebbi mangiato (\"I had eaten\") \u2013 tense\n*''Futuro semplice'' (simple future): io manger\u00f2 (\"I shall eat\") \u2013 tense\n*''Futuro anteriore'' (future perfect): io avr\u00f2 mangiato (\"I shall have eaten\") \u2013 future tense and perfect tense/aspect\n\nThe ''imperfetto''/''trapassato prossimo'' contrasts with the ''passato remoto''/''trapassato remoto'' in that ''imperfetto'' renders an imperfective (continuous) past while ''passato remoto'' expresses an aorist (punctual/historical) past.\n\nOther aspects in Italian are rendered with other periphrases, like [[prospective aspect|prospective]] (''io sto per mangiare'' \"I'm about to eat\", ''io star\u00f2 per mangiare'' \"I shall be about to eat\"), or [[Continuous aspect|continuous]]/[[Progressive aspect|progressive]] (''io sto mangiando'' \"I'm eating\", ''io star\u00f2 mangiando'' \"I shall be eating\").\n\n===Finnic languages===\n[[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Estonian language|Estonian]], among others, have a grammatical aspect contrast of [[telicity]] between telic and atelic. Telic sentences signal that the intended goal of an action is achieved. Atelic sentences do not signal whether any such goal has been achieved. The aspect is indicated by the [[List of grammatical cases|case]] of the object: [[accusative]] is telic and [[partitive]] is atelic. For example, the (implicit) purpose of shooting is to kill, such that:\n* ''Ammuin karhun'' -- \"I shot the bear (succeeded; it is done)\" i.e., \"I shot the bear dead\".\n* ''Ammuin karhua'' -- \"I shot at the bear\" i.e. the bear may have survived.\nIn rare cases corresponding telic and atelic forms can be unrelated by meaning.\n\nDerivational suffixes exist for various aspects. Examples:\n*''-ahta-'' (\"once\"), as in ''huudahtaa'' (\"to yell once\") (used for emotive verbs like \"laugh\", \"smile\", \"growl\", \"bark\"; is not used for verbs like \"shoot\", \"say\", \"drink\")\n*''-ele-'' \"repeatedly\" as in ''ammuskella'' \"to go shooting around\"\n\nThere are derivational suffixes for verbs, which carry [[frequentative]], [[momentane]], [[causative]], and [[inchoative]] aspect meanings. Also, pairs of verbs differing only in [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitivity]] exist.\n\n===Austronesian languages===\n\n==== Reo Rapa ====\n{{main|Rapa language}}\nThe [[Rapa language]] (Reo Rapa) was not created by the combination of two languages, but through the introduction of [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] to the monolingual Rapa community. Old Rapa words are still used for grammar and sentence structure, but most common words were replaced by [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]] words.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walworth|first=Mary|year=2017|title=Reo Rapa: A Polynesian Contact Language Contact|journal=Journal of Language|location=|pages=119|isbn=|quote=|via=}}</ref> Rapa is similar to [[English language|English]] as they both have specific tense words such as ''did'' or ''do''.\n\n*'''Past negative''' ''/ki\u2019ere/'' <ref name=\":0\" />\n:''ki\u2019ere vau <u>i</u> haere i <u>te</u> fare''\n:''ki\u2019ere'' (Negative) + ''vau'' (1S) + ''<u>i</u>'' (Prefective Aspect)) + ''haere'' (Go) + ''i'' (Prepositional) + ''<u>te</u>'' (Article) ''+ fare'' (House)\n:'I did not go to a house'\n*'''Non-past negative''' (Regular negative) ''/k\u0101re/'' <ref name=\":0\" />\n:''k\u0101re <u>t\u0101</u>-koe puta''\n: ''k\u0101re'' (Negative) + ''<u>t\u0101</u>-koe'' (Article)(Possive marker [a])-(2S) + ''puta'' (book)\n:You don't have your book.' (Literal translation \u2013 'your book doesn't exist')\n\n====Hawaiian====\nThe [[Hawaiian language]] conveys aspect as follows:<ref>[[\u00d6sten Dahl]], ''Tense and Aspect Systems'', Blackwell, 1985: ch. 6.</ref><ref>Sch\u00fctz, Albert J., ''All about Hawaiian'', Univ. of Hawaii Press, 1995: pp. 23-25.</ref><ref>Pukui, Mary Kawena, and Elbert, Samuel H., ''New Pocket Hawaiian Dictionary'', Univ. of Hawaii Press, 1992: pp. 228-231.</ref>\n\n*The unmarked verb, frequently used, can indicate habitual aspect or perfective aspect in the past.\n*''ke'' + verb + ''nei'' is frequently used and conveys the progressive aspect in the present.\n*''e'' + verb + ''ana'' conveys the progressive aspect in any tense.\n*''ua'' + verb conveys the perfective aspect but is frequently omitted.\n\n====Wuvulu====\n{{main|Wuvulu-Aua language}}\nWuvulu language is a minority language in Pacific. The Wuvulu verbal aspect is hard to organize because of its number of morpheme combination and interaction of semantics between morpheme.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Verb Morphology|url=|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|volume=|pages=91|via=}}</ref> Perfective, imperfective negation, simultaneous and habitual are four aspects markers in Wuvulu language.\n\n* '''Perfective''': The perfective marker \"-li\" indicates the action is done before other action. \n:Example: \n:ma\u0294ua \u0294i=na-li-ware-fa-rawani \u0294a\u0294a ro\u0294ou, Barafi\n:but 3SG=REAL-PERF-talk-CAUS-good with them PROPN\n:'But, Barafi had already clearly told hem.' <ref name=\":1\" />\n:* Imperfect negation: The marker \"ta-\" indicates the action has not done and also doesn't show anything about the action will be done in the future.

When the subject is dual or plural, the marker \u0294ei and i- are used in same situation.) <ref name=\":2\" /> \n* '''Habitual''': The marker fane- can indicate a habitual activity, which means \"keep doing something\" in English. Example: \n:ma \u0294i=na-fane-nara-nara fei nara faninilo ba, \u0294ale\u0294ena ba ini liai mei rama\u0294a mei\n:And 3SG=REAL-HAB-RED-think the thought PROPN COMP like COMP who again the person the \n:And the thought kept occurring to Faninilo, \"who is this particular person?\" <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hafford|first=James|year=2015|title=Verb Morphology|url=|journal=Wuvulu Grammar and Vocabulary|volume=|pages=93|via=}}</ref>\n\n====Tokelauan====\n{{main|Tokelauan language}}\nThere are three types of aspects one must consider when analyzing the Tokelauan language: inherent aspect, situation aspect, and viewpoint aspect.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Studies in Tokelauan syntax|last=Hooper|first=Robin|publisher=University Microfilms International|year=1994|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=137\u2013143|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe inherent aspect describes the purpose of a verb and what separates verbs from one another. According to Vendler, inherent aspect can be categorized into four different types: activities, achievements, accomplishments, and states. Simple activities include verbs such as pull, jump, and punch. Some achievements are continue and win. Drive-a-car is an accomplishment while hate is an example of a state. Another way to recognize a state inherent aspect is to note whether or not it changes. For example, if someone were to hate vegetables because they are allergic, this state of hate is unchanging and thus, a state inherent aspect. On the other hand, an achievement, unlike a state, only lasts for a short amount of time. Achievement is the highpoint of an action.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother type of aspect is situation aspect. Situation aspect is described to be what one is experiencing in his or her life through that circumstance. Therefore, it is his or her understanding of the situation. Situation aspect are abstract terms that are not physically tangible. They are also used based upon one's point of view. For example, a professor may say that a student who comes a minute before each class starts is a punctual student. Based upon the professor's judgment of what punctuality is, he or she may make that assumption of the situation with the student. Situation aspect is firstly divided into states and occurrences, then later subdivided under occurrences into processes and events, and lastly, under events, there are accomplishments and achievements.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe third type of aspect is viewpoint aspect. Viewpoint aspect can be likened to situation aspect such that they both take into consideration one's inferences. However, viewpoint aspect diverges from situation aspect because it is where one decides to view or see such event. A perfect example is the glass metaphor: Is the glass half full or is it half empty. The choice of being half full represents an optimistic viewpoint while the choice of being half empty represents a pessimistic viewpoint. Not only does viewpoint aspect separate into negative and positive, but rather different point of views. Having two people describe a painting can bring about two different viewpoints. One may describe a situation aspect as a perfect or imperfect. A perfect situation aspect entails an event with no reference to time, while an imperfect situation aspect makes a reference to time with the observation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==== Torau ====\nAspect in Torau is marked with post-verbal particles or clitics. While the system for marking the imperfective aspect is complex and highly developed, it is unclear if Torau marks the perfective and neutral viewpoints. The imperfective clitics index one of the core arguments, usually the nominative subject, and follow the rightmost element in a syntactic structure larger than the word. The two distinct forms for marking the imperfective aspect are ''(i)sa-'' and ''e-''. While more work needs to be done on this language, the preliminary hypothesis is that ''(i)sa-'' encodes the stative imperfective and ''e-'' encodes the active imperfective. It is also important to note that reduplication always cooccurs with ''e-'', but it usually does not with ''(i)sa-.'' This example below shows these two imperfective aspect markers giving different meanings to similar sentences.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Pita&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ma-to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mate=sa-la.''\n\n''&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'' Peter &nbsp;&nbsp;RL.3SGS-PST &nbsp;&nbsp;be.dead=IPFV-3SGS\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2018Peter was dead.\u2019\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''Pita&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ma-to &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;maa\u2248mate=e-la.''\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter &nbsp;&nbsp;RF.3SG-PST&nbsp;&nbsp;RD\u2248be.dead=IPFV-3SGS\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \u2018Peter was dying.\u2019\n\nIn Torau, the suffix -''to'', which must attach to a preverbal particle, may indicate similar meaning to the perfective aspect. In realis clauses, this suffix conveys an event that is entirely in the past and no longer occurring. When ''-to'' is used in irrealis clauses, the speaker conveys that the event will definitely occur (Palmer, 2007). Although this suffix isn\u2019t explicitly stated as a perfective viewpoint marker, the meaning that it contributes is very similar to the perfective viewpoint.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Bill|date=December 2007|title=Imperfective Aspect and the Interplay of Aspect, Tense, and Modality in Torau|journal=Oceanic Linguistics|volume=46|pages=499\u2013519|doi=10.1353/ol.2008.0000|jstor=20172325}}</ref>\n\n====Malay/Indonesian====\n{{main|Malay grammar}}\nLike many [[Austronesian languages]], the verbs of the [[Malay language]] follow a system of affixes to express changes in meaning. To express the aspects, Malay uses a number of [[auxiliary verbs]]:\n\n:*''sudah'': [[perfective aspect|perfective]], 'saya sudah makan' = 'I have [already] eaten'\n:*''baru'': near perfective, 'saya baru makan' = 'I have just eaten'\n:*''belum'': [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]], 'saya belum makan' = 'I have not eaten'\n:*''sedang'': [[Continuous and progressive aspects|progressive]] not implicating an end\n:*''masih'': progressive implicating an end\n:*''pernah'': [[semelfactive]]\n\n====Philippine languages====\n{{main|Tagalog grammar#Verbs}}\n\nLike many [[Austronesian languages]], the verbs of the [[Philippine languages]] follow a complex system of affixes to express subtle changes in meaning. However, the verbs in this family of languages are conjugated to express the aspects and not the tenses. Though many of the [[Philippine languages]] do not have a fully codified grammar, most of them follow the verb aspects that are demonstrated by [[Filipino language|Filipino]] or [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].\n\n===Creole languages===\n[[Creole language]]s<ref>Holm, John, ''An Introduction to Pidgins and Creoles'', Cambridge Univ. Press, 2000: pp. 173-189.</ref> typically use the unmarked verb for timeless habitual aspect, or for stative aspect, or for perfective aspect in the past. Invariant pre-verbal markers are often used. Non-stative verbs typically can optionally be marked for the progressive, habitual, completive, or irrealis aspect. The progressive in English-based [[Atlantic Creole]]s often uses ''de'' (from English \"be\"). [[Jamaican Creole]] uses ''a'' (from English \"are\") or ''de'' for the present progressive and a combination of the past time marker (''did'' , ''behn'' , ''ehn'' or ''wehn'') and the progressive marker (''a'' or ''de'') for the past progressive (e.g. ''did a'' or ''wehn de''). [[Haitian Creole]] uses the progressive marker ''ap''. Some Atlantic Creoles use one marker for both the habitual and progressive aspects. In [[Tok Pisin]], the optional progressive marker follows the verb. Completive markers tend to come from superstrate words like \"done\" or \"finish\", and some creoles model the future/irrealis marker on the superstrate word for \"go\".\n\n===American Sign Language===\n[[American Sign Language]] (ASL) is similar to many other sign languages in that it has no grammatical tense but many verbal aspects produced by modifying the base verb sign.\n\nAn example is illustrated with the verb [[wikt:1@Chin-PalmBack 1@FromChin-PalmUp|TELL]]. The basic form of this sign is produced with the initial posture of the index finger on the chin, followed by a movement of the hand and finger tip toward the indirect object (the recipient of the telling). Inflected into the unrealized inceptive aspect (\"to be just about to tell\"), the sign begins with the hand moving from in front of the trunk in an arc to the initial posture of the base sign (i.e., index finger touching the chin) while inhaling through the mouth, dropping the jaw, and directing eye gaze toward the verb's object. The posture is then held rather than moved toward the indirect object. During the hold, the signer also stops the breath by closing the glottis. Other verbs (such as \"look at\", \"wash the dishes\", \"yell\", \"flirt\") are inflected into the unrealized inceptive aspect similarly: The hands used in the base sign move in an arc from in front of the trunk to the initial posture of the underlying verb sign while inhaling, dropping the jaw, and directing eye gaze toward the verb's object (if any), but subsequent movements and postures are dropped as the posture and breath are held.\n\nOther aspects in ASL include the following: stative, inchoative (\"to begin to...\"), predispositional (\"to tend to...\"), susceptative (\"to... easily\"), frequentative (\"to... often\"), protractive (\"to... continuously\"), incessant (\"to... incessantly\"), durative (\"to... for a long time\"), iterative (\"to... over and over again\"), intensive (\"to... very much\"), resultative (\"to... completely\"), approximative (\"to... somewhat\"), semblitive (\"to appear to...\"), increasing (\"to... more and more\"). Some aspects combine with others to create yet finer distinctions.\n\nAspect is unusual in ASL in that transitive verbs derived for aspect lose their grammatical transitivity. They remain semantically transitive, typically assuming an object made prominent using a topic marker or mentioned in a previous sentence. See [[American Sign Language grammar#Syntax|Syntax in ASL]] for details.\n\n==Terms for various aspects==\nThe following aspectual terms are found in the literature.

[[Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9]] proposed the term dextrose (from Latin dexter = right), because in aqueous solution of glucose, the plane of linearly polarized light is turned to the right. In contrast, D-fructose (a ketohexose) and L-glucose turn linearly polarized light to the left. The earlier notation according to the rotation of the plane of linearly polarized light (''d'' and ''l''-nomenclature) was later abandoned in favor of the D- and L-notation, which refers to the absolute configuration of the asymmetric center farthest from the carbonyl group, and in concordance with the configuration of D- or L-glyceraldehyde.<ref name=\"Robyt 7\">John F.

The remaining  [[covalent bond|bonds]] of the backbone carbons are satisfied by [[hydrogen]] atoms -H. Therefore, glucose is both a [[hexose]] and an [[aldose]], or an [[aldohexose]]. The aldehyde group makes glucose a [[reducing sugar]] giving a positive reaction with the [[Fehling test]].\n\nEach of the four carbons C-2 through C-5 is a [[stereocenter]], meaning that its four bonds connect to four different substituents.  (Carbon C-2, for example, connects to -(C=O)H, -OH, -H, and -(CHOH)<sub>4</sub>H.)  In <small>D</small>-glucose, these four parts must be in a specific three-dimensional arrangement. Namely, when the molecule is drawn in the [[Fischer projection]], the hydroxyls on C-2, C-4, and C-5 must be on the right side, while that on C-3 must be on the left side.\n\nThe positions of those four hydroxyls are exactly reversed in the Fischer diagram of [[L-Glucose|<small>L</small>-glucose]].  <small>D</small>- and <small>L</small>-glucose are two of the 16 possible aldohexoses; the other 14 are [[allose]], [[altrose]], [[galactose]], [[gulose]], [[idose]], [[mannose]], and [[talose]], each with two [[enantiomer]]s, \u201c<small>D</small>-\u201d and \u201c<small>L</small>-\u201d.\n\nIt is important to note that the linear form of glucose makes up less than 0.02 % of the glucose molecules in a water solution. The rest is one of two cyclic forms of glucose that are formed when the hydroxyl group on carbon 5 (C5) bonds to the aldehyde carbon 1 (C1).\n\n===Cyclic forms===\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 600\n| image_style = border:none;\n| background color = white\n| perrow = 4\n| image1 = Alpha-D-Glucopyranose.svg | width1 = 157 | height1 = 170\n| image2 = Alpha-D-glucose-from-xtal-1979-3D-balls.png | width2 = 1014 | height2 = 1100\n| image3 = Beta-D-Glucopyranose.svg | width3 = 157 | height3 = 170\n| image4 = Beta-D-glucose-from-xtal-3D-balls.png | width4 = 1034 | height4 = 1100\n| image5 = Alpha-D-Glucofuranose.svg | width5 = 173 | height5 = 187\n| image6 = Alpha-D-Glucofuranose Molek\u00fclbaukasten 9134 (crop).jpg | width6 = 3073 | height6 = 3074\n| image7 = Beta-D-Glucofuranose.svg | width7 = 173 | height7 = 187\n| image8 = Beta-D-Glucofuranose Molek\u00fclbaukasten 9136 (crop).jpg | width8 = 3089 | height8 = 2873\n| header = {{huge|Cyclic forms of glucose}}<br />{{white|.}}\n| footer = <br />From left to right: [[Haworth projection]]s and [[ball-and-stick model|ball-and-stick]] structures of the \u03b1- and \u03b2- [[anomer]]s of {{small|D}}-glucopyranose (top row) and {{small|D}}-glucofuranose (bottom row)\n}}\nIn solutions, the open-chain form of glucose (either \"{{small|D}}-\" or \"{{small|L}}-\") exists in equilibrium with several [[Carbohydrate#Ring-straight chain isomerism|cyclic isomers]], each containing a ring of carbons closed by one oxygen atom. In aqueous solution however, more than 99% of glucose molecules, at any given time, exist as [[pyranose]] forms. The open-chain form is limited to about 0.25% and [[furanose]] forms exists in negligible amounts. The terms \"glucose\" and \"{{small|D}}-glucose\" are generally used for these cyclic forms as well. The ring arises from the open-chain form by an intramolecular [[nucleophilic addition]] reaction between the aldehyde group (at C-1) and either the C-4 or C-5 hydroxyl group, forming a [[hemiacetal]] linkage, -C(OH)H-O-.\n\nThe reaction between C-1 and C-5 yields a six-membered [[heterocycle|heterocyclic]] system called a pyranose, which is a monosaccharide sugar (hence \"\u2013ose\") containing a derivatised [[pyran]] skeleton. The (much rarer) reaction between C-1 and C-4 yields a five-membered furanose ring, named after the cyclic ether [[furan]].  In either case, each carbon in the ring has one hydrogen and one hydroxyl attached, except for the last carbon (C-4 or C-5) where the hydroxyl is replaced by the remainder of the open molecule (which is -(C(CH<sub>2</sub>OH)HOH)-H or -(CHOH)-H, respectively).\n\nThe ring-closing reaction makes carbon C-1 [[Chirality|chiral]], too, since its four bonds lead to -H, to -OH, to carbon C-2, and to the ring oxygen.  These four parts of the molecule may be arranged around C-1 (the [[anomeric carbon]]) in two distinct ways, designated by the prefixes \"\u03b1-\" and \"\u03b2-\".  When a glucopyranose molecule is drawn in the [[Haworth projection]], the designation \"\u03b1-\" means that the hydroxyl group attached to C-1 and the -CH<sub>2</sub>OH group at C-5 lies on opposite sides of the ring's plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''trans'']] arrangement), while \"\u03b2-\" means that they are on the same side of the plane (a [[cis-trans isomerism|''cis'']] arrangement). Therefore, the open-chain isomer {{small|D}}-glucose gives rise to four distinct cyclic isomers: \u03b1-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, \u03b2-{{small|D}}-glucopyranose, \u03b1-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose, and \u03b2-{{small|D}}-glucofuranose. These five structures exist in equilibrium and interconvert, and the interconversion is much more rapid with acid [[catalysis]].\n\n[[File:\u0391-d-glucose and \u03b2-d-glucose acid-catalyzed mechanism.png|centre|800px|Widely proposed arrow-pushing mechanism for acid-catalyzed dynamic equilibrium between the \u03b1- and \u03b2- [[anomer]]s of D-glucopyranose]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| total_width = 400\n| image_style = border:none;\n| background color = white\n| image1 = ALPHA-D-Glucopyranose V.1.png | width1 = 2240 | height1 = 1662\n| image2 = BETA-D-Glucopyranose V.1.png | width2 = 2608| height2 = 1420\n| footer = <br />[[Chair conformation]]s of \u03b1- (left) and \u03b2- (right) {{small|D}}-glucopyranose\n}}\nThe other open-chain isomer {{small|L}}-glucose similarly gives rise to four distinct cyclic forms of {{small|L}}-glucose, each the mirror image of the corresponding {{small|D}}-glucose.\n\nThe rings are not planar, but are twisted in three dimensions. The glucopyranose ring (\u03b1 or \u03b2) can assume several non-planar shapes, analogous to the \"chair\" and \"boat\" conformations of [[cyclohexane]].  Similarly, the glucofuranose ring may assume several shapes, analogous to the \"envelope\" conformations of [[cyclopentane]].\n\nIn the solid state, only the glucopyranose forms are observed, forming colorless crystalline solids that are highly [[Solubility|soluble]] in water and [[acetic acid]] but poorly soluble in [[methanol]] and [[ethanol]].  They melt at {{convert|146|C|F}} (''\u03b1'') and {{convert|150|C|F}} (''\u03b2''), and [[Decomposition|decompose]] at higher temperatures into [[carbon]] and water.\n\n===Rotational isomers===\nEach glucose [[isomer]] is subject to [[rotamer|rotational isomerism]]. Within the cyclic form of glucose, rotation may occur around the O6-C6-C5-O5 [[torsion angle]], termed the ''\u03c9''-angle, to form three staggered rotamer conformations called ''gauche''-''gauche'' (gg), ''gauche''-''trans'' (gt) and ''trans''-''gauche'' (tg).<ref>For methyl \u03b1-D-glucuopyranose at equilibrium, the ratio of molecules in each rotamer conformation is reported to be  57% gg, 38% gt, and 5% tg.

The epimeric ratio \u03b1:\u03b2 is 36:64. In the \u03b1-D-glucopyranose (left), the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in the axial position at the anomeric center, whereas in the \u03b2-D-glucopyranose (right) the blue-labeled hydroxy group is in equatorial position at the anomeric center.]]\nMutarotation consists of a temporary reversal of the ring-forming reaction, resulting in the open-chain form, followed by a reforming of the ring. The ring closure step may use a different -OH group than the one recreated by the opening step (thus switching between pyranose and furanose forms), or the new hemiacetal group created on C-1 may have the same or opposite handedness as the original one (thus switching between the \u03b1 and \u03b2 forms). Thus, though the open-chain form is barely detectable in solution, it is an essential component of the equilibrium.\n\nThe open-chain form is [[Chemical stability|thermodynamically unstable]], and it spontaneously [[isomer]]izes to the cyclic forms.  (Although the ring closure reaction could in theory create four- or three-atom rings, these would be highly strained, and are not observed in practice.)  In solutions at [[room temperature]], the four cyclic isomers interconvert over a time scale of hours, in a process called [[mutarotation]].<ref>{{McMurry2nd | page = 866}}.</ref>  Starting from any proportions, the mixture converges to a stable ratio of \u03b1:\u03b2 36:64.<!--AT ANY TEMPERATURE?--> The ratio would be \u03b1:\u03b2 11:89 if it were not for the influence of the [[anomeric effect]].<ref>{{citation | title = The Anomeric Effect | last1 = Juaristi | first1 = Eusebio | first2 = Gabriel | last2 = Cuevas | year = 1995 | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 9\u201310 | isbn = 0-8493-8941-0}}</ref>  Mutarotation is considerably slower at temperatures close to {{convert|0|C}}.\n\n===Optical activity===\nWhether in water or in the solid form, <small>D</small>-(+)-glucose is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotatory]], meaning it will rotate the direction of [[polarized light]] clockwise as seen looking toward the light source.  The effect is due to the [[chirality]] of the molecules, and indeed the mirror-image isomer, <small>L</small>-(\u2212)-glucose, is [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotatory]] (rotates polarized light counterclockwise) by the same amount. The strength of the effect is different for each of the five [[tautomer]]s.\n\nNote that the <small>D</small>- prefix does not refer directly to the optical properties of the compound. It indicates that the C-5 chiral center has the same handedness as that of <small>D</small>-glyceraldehyde (which was so labeled because it is dextrorotatory).  The fact that <small>D</small>-glucose is dextrorotatory is a combined effect of its four chiral centers, not just of C-5; and indeed some of the other <small>D</small>-aldohexoses are levorotatory.<!--CHECK-->\n\nThe conversion between the two anomers can be observed in a [[polarimeter]], since pure \u03b1- D- glucose has a specific rotation angle of +112.2 \u00b0 \u00b7 ml \u00b7 dm<sup>\u22121</sup> \u00b7 g<sup>\u22121</sup>, pure \u03b2- D- glucose of +17.5 \u00b0 \u00b7 ml \u00b7 dm<sup>\u22121</sup> \u00b7 g<sup>-1</sup>.<ref name=\"Hesse\">Manfred Hesse, Herbert Meier, Bernd Zeeh, Stefan Bienz, Laurent Bigler, Thomas Fox: ''Spektroskopische Methoden in der organischen Chemie''. 8th revised Edition.

In humans, the breakdown of glucose-containing polysaccharides happens in part already during [[mastication|chewing]] by means of [[amylase]], which is contained in [[saliva]], as well as by [[maltase]], [[lactase]] and [[sucrase]] on the [[brush border]] of the small intestine. Glucose is a building block of many carbohydrates and can be split off from them using certain enzymes. [[Glucosidases]], a subgroup of the glycosidases, first catalyze the hydrolysis of long-chain glucose-containing polysaccharides, removing terminal glucose. In turn, disaccharides are mostly degraded by specific glycosidases to glucose. The names of the degrading enzymes are often derived from the particular poly- and disaccharide; inter alia, for the degradation of polysaccharide chains there are amylases (named after amylose, a component of starch), cellulases (named after cellulose), chitinases (named after chitin) and more. Furthermore, for the cleavage of disaccharides, there are maltase, lactase, sucrase, [[trehalase]] and others. In humans, about 70 genes are known that code for glycosidases.

Glycogen is the body's \"glucose energy storage\" mechanism, because it is much more \"space efficient\" and less reactive than glucose itself.\n\nAs a result of its importance in human health, glucose is an analyte in [[glucose test]]s that are common medical [[blood test]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.468.2196&rep=rep1&type=pdf|pmid=22872934|year=2012|author1=Clarke|first1=S.

The [[glycemic load]] is an indicator for the amount of glucose added to blood glucose levels after consumption, based on the glycemic index and the amount of consumed food.\n\n===Precursor===\nOrganisms use glucose as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances. [[Starch]], [[cellulose]], and [[glycogen]] (\"animal starch\") are common glucose [[polymer]]s ([[polysaccharide]]s). Some of these polymers (starch or glycogen) serve as energy stores, while others (cellulose and [[chitin]], which is made from a derivative of glucose) have structural roles. [[Oligosaccharide]]s of glucose combined with other sugars serve as important energy stores. These include [[lactose]], the predominant sugar in milk, which is a glucose-galactose disaccharide, and [[sucrose]], another disaccharide which is composed of glucose and [[fructose]]. Glucose is also added onto certain proteins and [[lipid]]s in a process called [[glycosylation]]. This is often critical for their functioning. The enzymes that join glucose to other molecules usually use [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] glucose to power the formation of the new bond by coupling it with the breaking of the glucose-phosphate bond.\n\nOther than its direct use as a monomer, glucose can be broken down to synthesize a wide variety of other biomolecules. This is important, as glucose serves both as a primary store of energy and as a source of organic carbon. Glucose can be broken down and converted into [[lipids]]. It is also a precursor for the synthesis of other important molecules such as vitamin C ([[ascorbic acid]]). In living organisms, glucose is converted to several other chemical compounds that are the starting material for various [[metabolic pathway]]s. Among them, all other monosaccharides<ref name=\"L\u00f6ffler/Petrides 27\">Peter C. Heinrich: ''L\u00f6ffler/Petrides Biochemie und Pathobiochemie.''

Glucose is used in some bacteria as a building block in the [[trehalose]] or the [[dextran]] biosynthesis and in animals as a building block of glycogen. Glucose can also be converted from bacterial [[xylose isomerase]] to fructose. In addition, glucose [[metabolite]]s produce all nonessential [[amino acid]]s, [[sugar alcohol]]s such as [[mannitol]] and [[sorbitol]], [[fatty acid]]s, [[cholesterol]] and [[nucleic acid]]s.<ref name=\"L\u00f6ffler/Petrides 27\" /> Finally, glucose is used as a building block in the [[glycosylation]] of proteins to [[glycoprotein]]s, [[glycolipid]]s, [[peptidoglycan]]s, [[glycoside]]s and other substances (catalyzed by [[glycosyltransferase]]s) and can be cleaved from them by [[glycosidase]]s.\n\n==Pathology==\n===Diabetes===\n[[Diabetes mellitus|Diabetes]] is a metabolic disorder where the body is unable to regulate [[Blood sugar|levels of glucose in the blood]] either because of a lack of insulin in the body or the failure, by cells in the body, to respond properly to insulin. Each of these situations can be caused by persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, through pancreatic burnout and [[insulin resistance]]. The [[pancreas]] is the organ responsible for the secretion of the hormones insulin and glucagon.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = R\u00f6der PV, Wu B, Liu Y, Han W | title = Pancreatic Regulation of Glucose Homeostasis | journal = Exp.

Without it, glucose cannot enter the cell and therefore cannot be used as fuel for the body's functions.<ref>Estela, Carlos (2011) \"Blood Glucose Levels,\" Undergraduate Journal of Mathematical Modeling: One + Two: Vol. 3: Iss. 2, Article 12.</ref> If the pancreas is exposed to persistently high elevations of blood glucose levels, the [[beta cell|insulin-producing cells]] in the pancreas could be damaged, causing a lack of insulin in the body. Insulin resistance occurs when the pancreas tries to produce more and more insulin in response to persistently elevated blood glucose levels. Eventually, the rest of the body becomes resistant to the insulin that the pancreas is producing, thereby requiring more insulin to achieve the same blood glucose-lowering effect, and forcing the pancreas to produce even more insulin to compete with the resistance. This negative spiral contributes to pancreatic burnout, and the disease progression of diabetes.\n\nTo monitor the body's response to blood glucose-lowering therapy, glucose levels can be measured. [[Blood glucose monitoring]] can be performed by multiple methods, such as the fasting glucose test which measures the level of glucose in the blood after 8 hours of fasting. Another test is the 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) \u2013 for this test, the person has a fasting glucose test done, then drinks a 75-gram glucose drink and is retested. This test measures the ability of the person's body to process glucose. Over time the blood glucose levels should decrease as insulin allows it to be taken up by cells and exit the blood stream.\n\n===Overweight and fatty liver===\nAn increased intake of glucose leads to [[obesity]] and, in consequence, partly to the [[metabolic syndrome]] with [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]],<ref>H.

For sugar mixtures, the concentration can be determined with a [[refractometer]], for example in the [[Oechsle scale|Oechsle]] determination in the course of the production of wine.\n\n====Photometric enzymatic methods in solution====\n{{main|Glucose oxidation reaction}}\nThe enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) converts glucose into gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide while consuming oxygen. Another enzyme, peroxidase, catalyzes a chromogenic reaction (Trinder reaction)<ref>P. Trinder: ''Determination of glucose in blood using glucose oxidase with an alternative oxygen acceptor.''

The reagents are immobilised on a polymer matrix, the so-called test strip, which assumes a more or less intense color. This can be measured reflectometrically at 510&nbsp;nm with the aid of an LED-based handheld photometer. This allows for routine blood sugar determination by laymen. In addition to the reaction of phenol with 4-aminoantipyrine, new chromogenic reactions have been developed that allow photometry at higher wavelengths (550&nbsp;nm, 750&nbsp;nm).<ref>M.

Functions performed include window definition, window control, and monitoring of [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] and [[Computer mouse|mouse]] input. Routines for drawing a number of geometric primitives (both in solid and wireframe mode) are also provided, including [[cube (geometry)|cubes]], [[sphere]]s and the [[Utah teapot]]. GLUT also has some limited support for creating pop-up menus.\n\nGLUT was written by [[Mark Kilgard|Mark J. Kilgard]], author of ''OpenGL Programming for the X Window System'' and ''The Cg Tutorial: The Definitive Guide to Programmable Real-Time Graphics'', while he was working for [[Silicon Graphics]] Inc.\n\nThe two aims of GLUT are to allow the creation of rather portable code between operating systems (GLUT is [[cross-platform]]) and to make learning OpenGL easier. Getting started with OpenGL programming while using GLUT often takes only a few lines of code and does not require knowledge of operating system\u2013specific windowing [[application programming interface|APIs]].\n\nAll GLUT functions start with the <code>glut</code> prefix (for example, <code>glutPostRedisplay</code> marks the current window as needing to be redrawn).\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe original GLUT library by Mark Kilgard supports the [[X Window System]] ([[GLX]]) and was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] ([[WGL (software)|WGL]]) by [[Nate Robins]]. Additionally, [[macOS]] ships with a GLUT framework that supports its own NSGL/[[Core OpenGL|CGL]].\n\nKilgard's GLUT library is no longer maintained, and its license did not permit the redistribution of modified versions of the library. This spurred the need for [[free software]] or [[open source]] reimplementations of the API from scratch. The first such library was [[FreeGLUT]], which aims to be a reasonably close reproduction, though introducing a small number of new functions to deal with GLUT's limitations. OpenGLUT, a [[fork (software)|fork]] of FreeGLUT, adds a number of new features to the original API, but work on it ceased in May 2005.\n\nMark Kilgard has a GitHub repository for GLUT.<ref>https://github.com/markkilgard/glut</ref>  The glut.h header file contains the following license:<ref>https://github.com/markkilgard/glut/blob/master/include/GL/glut.h</ref>\n\n /* Copyright (c) Mark J. Kilgard, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2006, 2010. */\n \n /* This program is freely distributable without licensing fees  and is\n   provided without guarantee or warrantee expressed or  implied. This\n   program is -not- in the public domain. */\n\n== Limitations ==\nSome of GLUT's original design decisions made it hard for programmers to perform desired tasks. This led many to create non-canon patches and extensions to GLUT.[http://www.mathies.com/glfaq/GLToolkitFAQ.html#II] Some [[free software]] or [[open source]] reimplementations also include fixes.\n\nSome of the more notable limitations of the original GLUT library include:\n* The library requires programmers to call <code>glutMainLoop()</code>, a function which never returns. This makes it hard for programmers to integrate GLUT into a program or library which wishes to have control of its own event loop. A common patch to fix this is to introduce a new function, called <code>glutCheckLoop()</code> (macOS) or <code>glutMainLoopEvent()</code> (FreeGLUT/OpenGLUT), which runs only a single iteration of the GLUT event loop. Another common workaround is to run GLUT's event loop in a separate [[thread (computing)|thread]], although this may vary by operating system, and also may introduce [[synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] issues or other problems: for example, the macOS GLUT implementation requires that <code>glutMainLoop()</code> be run in the main thread.\n* The fact that <code>glutMainLoop()</code> never returns also means that a GLUT program cannot exit the event loop. [[FreeGLUT]] fixes this by introducing a new function, <code>glutLeaveMainLoop()</code>.\n* The library terminates the process when the window is closed; for some applications this may not be desired. Thus, many implementations include an extra callback, such as <code>glutWMCloseFunc()</code>.\n\nSince it is no longer maintained (essentially replaced by the [[open source]] [[FreeGLUT]]) the above design issues are still not resolved in the original GLUT.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[EGL (API)|EGL]] is an interface between [[OpenGL ES]] or [[OpenVG]] and a [[windowing system]].\n* [[FreeGLUT]] is intended to be a full replacement for GLUT, and has only a few differences.\n* [[GLFW]]\n* [[OpenGL User Interface Library]] (GLUI)\n* [[OpenGL Utility Library]] (GLU)\n* [[PLIB]]\n* [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] (SDL)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/ GLUT - The OpenGL Utility Toolkit]\n* [https://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glut/spec3/spec3.html The OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) Programming Interface API Version 3] (official documentation)\n\n[[Category:OpenGL]]", "sha1": "gyhu4p01mtlnt3owuer9yjw0sdprqpt"}}, {"title": "Giovanni Boccaccio", "ns": "0", "id": "12957", "revision": {"id": "866692341", "parentid": "866691584", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T22:46:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "CLCStudent", "id": "26398660"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/203.31.11.220|203.31.11.220]] ([[User talk:203.31.11.220|talk]]) to last version by ClueBot NG", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect|Boccaccio}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2012}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n | name        = Giovanni Boccaccio\n | image       = Boccaccio by Morghen.jpg\n | imagesize   = 200 px\n | spouse =\n | relatives   = Boccaccino di Chellino (father)<br>Margherita de' Mardoli (stepmother) \n | birth_date  = 16 June 1313\n | birth_place = [[Certaldo]], [[Republic of Florence]]\n | death_date  = 21 December 1375<br>(aged 62)\n | death_place = [[Certaldo]], [[Republic of Florence]]\n | occupation  = Writer, poet\n | nationality = Italian\n | period      = [[Late Middle Ages]]\n}}\n'''Giovanni Boccaccio''' ({{IPAc-en|b|o\u028a|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|t\u0283|i|o\u028a|,_|b|\u0259|-|,_|-|t\u0283|o\u028a}}; {{IPA-it|d\u0292o\u02c8vanni bok\u02c8katt\u0283o|lang}}; 16 June 1313&nbsp;\u2013 21 December 1375)<ref>Bartlett, Kenneth R.

Boccaccio wrote a number of notable works, including ''[[The Decameron]]'' and ''[[De mulieribus claris|On Famous Women]]''. He wrote his imaginative literature mostly in the Italian [[vernacular]], as well as other works in Latin, and is particularly noted for his realistic dialogue which differed from that of his contemporaries, [[medieval literature|medieval writers]] who usually followed formulaic models for character and plot.\n\n==Biography==\nThe details of Boccaccio's birth are uncertain.

His father worked for the [[Compagnia dei Bardi]] and, in the 1320s, married Margherita dei Mardoli, who was of a well-to-do family. Boccaccio may have been tutored by Giovanni Mazzuoli and received from him an early introduction to the works of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]. In 1326, his father was appointed head of a bank and moved with his family to [[Naples]]. Boccaccio was an apprentice at the bank but disliked the banking profession. He persuaded his father to let him study law at the ''[[Studium generale|Studium]]''<ref name=\"bartlett 43\"/> (the present-day [[University of Naples Federico II|University of Naples]]), where he studied [[canon law]] for the next six years. He also pursued his interest in scientific and literary studies.<ref>''New Standard Encyclopedia'', 1992. \"Boccaccio, Giovanni\"; Volume B, p. 316. Chicago: Standard Educational Corporation</ref>\n\nHis father introduced him to the Neapolitan nobility and the French-influenced court of [[Robert, King of Naples|Robert the Wise]] (the king of Naples) in the 1330s. At this time, he fell in love with a married daughter of the king, who is portrayed as \"[[Fiammetta]]\" in many of Boccaccio's prose romances, including ''Il Filocolo'' (1338). Boccaccio became a friend of fellow Florentine [[Niccol\u00f2 Acciaioli]], and benefited from his influence as the administrator, and perhaps the lover, of [[Catherine II, Latin Empress|Catherine of Valois-Courtenay]], widow of [[Philip I, Prince of Taranto|Philip I of Taranto]]. Acciaioli later became counselor to Queen [[Joanna I of Naples]] and, eventually, her ''[[Seneschal|Grand Seneschal]]''.\n\nIt seems that Boccaccio enjoyed law no more than banking, but his studies allowed him the opportunity to study widely and make good contacts with fellow scholars. His early influences included Paolo da Perugia (a curator and author of a collection of [[myths]] called the ''Collectiones''), humanists Barbato da Sulmona and Giovanni Barrili, and theologian [[Dionigi di Borgo San Sepolcro]].\n\n===Adult years===\n[[File:Boccaccio01.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Boccaccio's statue in [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nIn Naples, Boccaccio began what he considered his true vocation of poetry. Works produced in this period include ''[[Il Filostrato]]'' and ''[[Teseida]]'' (the sources for [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]'' and ''[[The Knight's Tale]]'', respectively), ''[[The Filocolo]]'' (a prose version of an existing French romance), and ''La caccia di Diana'' (a poem in ''[[terza rima]]'' listing Neapolitan women).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/the_project/|title=Complete list of Boccaccio works at Decameron|publisher=|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref> The period featured considerable formal innovation, including possibly the introduction of the [[Sicilian octave]], where it influenced [[Petrarch]].\n\nBoccaccio returned to Florence in early 1341, avoiding the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] of 1340 in that city, but also missing the visit of Petrarch to Naples in 1341. He had left Naples due to tensions between the Angevin king and Florence. His father had returned to Florence in 1338, where he had gone bankrupt. His mother died shortly afterward (possibly, as she was unknown \u2014 see above). Boccaccio continued to work, although dissatisfied with his return to Florence, producing ''Comedia delle ninfe fiorentine'' in 1341 (also known as ''Ameto''), a mix of prose and poems, completing the fifty-[[canto]] allegorical poem ''Amorosa visione'' in 1342, and ''[[Elegia di Madonna Fiammetta|Fiammetta]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/10006 |title=Boccaccio, Giovanni '&#39;La Fiammetta'&#39; (1342), Project Gutenburg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2003-11-01 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> in 1343. The pastoral piece \"Ninfale fiesolano\" probably dates from this time, also. In 1343, Boccaccio's father remarried to Bice del Bostichi. His children by his first marriage had all died, but he had another son named Iacopo in 1344.\n\n[[File:Giovanni Boccaccio and Florentines who have fled from the plague.jpg|thumb|Giovanni Boccaccio and Florentines who have fled from the plague]]\n\nIn Florence, the overthrow of [[Walter VI, Count of Brienne|Walter of Brienne]] brought about the government of ''popolo minuto'' (\"small people\", workers). It diminished the influence of the nobility and the wealthier merchant classes and assisted in the relative decline of Florence. The city was hurt further in 1348 by the [[Black Death]], which killed some three-quarters of the city's population, later represented in the ''Decameron''.\n\nFrom 1347, Boccaccio spent much time in Ravenna, seeking new patronage and, despite his claims, it is not certain whether he was present in plague-ravaged Florence. His stepmother died during the epidemic and his father was closely associated with the government efforts as Minister of Supply in the city. His father died in 1349 and Boccaccio was forced into a more active role as head of the family.\n\nBoccaccio began work on ''[[The Decameron]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3726 |title=Boccaccio, Giovanni '&#39;The Decameron'&#39;, Volume I, Project Gutenburg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2003-02-01 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/13102 |title=Boccaccio, Giovanni '&#39;The Decameron'&#39;, Volume II, Project Gutenburg |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2004-08-03 |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> around 1349. It is probable that the structures of many of the tales date from earlier in his career, but the choice of a hundred tales and the frame-story ''lieta brigata'' of three men and seven women dates from this time. The work was largely complete by 1352. It was Boccaccio's final effort in literature and one of his last works in Italian; the only other substantial work was ''[[Corbaccio]]'' (dated to either 1355 or 1365). Boccaccio revised and rewrote ''The Decameron'' in 1370\u20131371. This manuscript has survived to the present day.\n\nFrom 1350, Boccaccio became closely involved with Italian humanism (although less of a scholar) and also with the Florentine government. His first official mission was to [[Romagna]] in late 1350. He revisited that city-state twice and also was sent to [[Brandenburg]], [[Milan]] and [[Avignon]]. He also pushed for the study of Greek, housing [[Barlaam of Seminara|Barlaam of Calabria]], and encouraging his tentative translations of works by [[Homer]], [[Euripides]], and [[Aristotle]]. In these years, he also took [[minor orders]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Encyclopedia of medieval literature \u2013 Boccaccio, Giovanni | url=http://medieval_literature.enacademic.com/80/Boccaccio,_Giovanni | accessdate=4 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1350, he was delegated to greet Francesco Petrarch as he entered Florence and also to have Petrarch as a guest at Boccaccio's home, during his stay. The meeting between the two was extremely fruitful and they were friends from then on, Boccaccio calling Petrarch his teacher and ''magister''. Petrarch at that time encouraged Boccaccio to study classical Greek and Latin literature. They met again in [[Padua]] in 1351, Boccaccio on an official mission to invite Petrarch to take a chair at the university in Florence. Although unsuccessful, the discussions between the two were instrumental in Boccaccio writing the ''[[Genealogia deorum gentilium]]''; the first edition was completed in 1360 and this remained one of the key reference works on classical mythology for over 400 years. It served as an extended defense for the studies of ancient literature and thought. Despite the Pagan beliefs at its core, Boccaccio believed that much could be learned from antiquity. Thus, he challenged the arguments of clerical intellectuals who wanted to limit access to classical sources to prevent any moral harm to Christian readers. The revival of classical antiquity became a foundation of the Renaissance, and his defense of the importance of ancient literature was an essential requirement for its development.<ref>King, Margaret L. \"The Renaissance in Europe\". Laurence King Publishing, 2003, p.54.</ref> The discussions also formalized Boccaccio's poetic ideas. Certain sources also see a conversion of Boccaccio by Petrarch from the open humanist of the ''Decameron'' to a more ascetic style, closer to the dominant fourteenth century ethos. For example, he followed Petrarch (and Dante) in the unsuccessful championing of an archaic and deeply allusive form of Latin poetry. In 1359, following a meeting with [[Pope Innocent VI]] and further meetings with Petrarch, it is probable that Boccaccio took some kind of religious mantle. There is a persistent (but unsupported) tale that he repudiated his earlier works as profane in 1362, including ''The Decameron''.\n\n[[File:De claris mulieribus.jpg|thumb|[[Circe]]s: illustration of one of the women featured the 1374 biographies of 106 famous women, ''De Claris Mulieribus'', by Boccaccio \u2013 from a German translation of 1541]]\nIn 1360, Boccaccio began work on ''[[De mulieribus claris]]'', a book offering biographies of one hundred and six famous women, that he completed in 1374.\n\nA number of Boccaccio's close friends and other acquaintances were executed or exiled in the purge following the failed coup of 1361. It was in this year that Boccaccio left Florence to reside in Certaldo, although not directly linked to the conspiracy, where he became less involved in government affairs. He did not undertake further missions for Florence until 1365, and traveled to Naples and then on to Padua and [[Venice]], where he met up with Petrarch in grand style at [[Palazzo Molina, Venice|Palazzo Molina]], Petrarch's residence as well as the place of [[Petrarch's library]]. He later returned to [[Certaldo]]. He met Petrarch only once again in Padua in 1368. Upon hearing of the death of Petrarch (19 July 1374), Boccaccio wrote a commemorative poem, including it in his collection of lyric poems, the ''Rime''.\n\nHe returned to work for the Florentine government in 1365, undertaking a mission to [[Pope Urban V]]. The papacy returned to Rome from [[Avignon]] in 1367, and Boccaccio was again sent to Urban, offering congratulations. He also undertook diplomatic missions to Venice and Naples.\n\nOf his later works, the moralistic biographies gathered as ''De casibus virorum illustrium'' (1355\u201374) and ''De mulieribus claris'' (1361\u20131375) were most significant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/il_boccaccio/index.html |title=The chronological archives of his complete works |publisher=Digilander.libero.it |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> Other works include a dictionary of geographical allusions in classical literature, ''De montibus, silvis, fontibus, lacubus, fluminibus, stagnis seu paludibus, et de nominibus maris liber''. He gave a series of lectures on Dante at the Santo Stefano church in 1373 and these resulted in his final major work, the detailed ''Esposizioni sopra la Commedia di Dante''.<ref>[http://www.intratext.com/Catalogo/Autori/AUT47.HTM Works of Giovanni Boccaccio] text, concordances and frequency lists</ref> Boccaccio and Petrarch were also two of the most educated people in early Renaissance in the field of [[archaeology]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=498505 |title= Boccaccio's Archaeological Knowledge}}</ref>\n\nBoccaccio's change in writing style in the 1350s was due in part to meeting with Petrarch, but it was mostly due to poor health and a premature weakening of his physical strength. It also was due to disappointments in love. Some such disappointment could explain why Boccaccio came suddenly to write in a bitter ''Corbaccio'' style, having previously written always in praise of women and love. Petrarch describes how Pietro Petrone (a [[Carthusian]] monk) on his death bed in 1362 sent another Carthusian (Gioacchino Ciani) to urge him to renounce his worldly studies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/shakespeare/article-756 |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 2007, '&#39;Petrarch and Boccaccio's mature years.'&#39; |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-17}}</ref> Petrarch then dissuaded Boccaccio from burning his own works and selling off his personal library, letters, books, and manuscripts. Petrarch even offered to purchase Boccaccio's library, so that it would become part of [[Petrarch's library]].

He was born near [[Busseto]] to a provincial family of moderate means, and developed a musical education with the help of a local patron.  Verdi came to dominate the Italian opera scene after the era of [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], and [[Gioachino Rossini]], whose works significantly influenced him. By his 30s, he had become one of the pre-eminent opera composers in history.\n\nIn his early operas, Verdi demonstrated a sympathy with the [[Risorgimento]] movement which sought the unification of Italy. He also participated briefly as an elected politician. The chorus \"[[Va, pensiero]]\" from his early opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' (1842), and similar choruses in later operas, were much in the spirit of the unification movement, and the composer himself became esteemed as a representative of these ideals. An intensely private person, Verdi, however, did not seek to ingratiate himself with popular movements and as he became professionally successful was able to reduce his operatic workload and sought to establish himself as a landowner in his native region. He surprised the musical world by returning, after his success with the opera ''[[Aida]]'' (1871), with three late masterpieces: his [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] (1874), and the operas ''[[Otello]]'' (1887) and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' (1893).\n\nHis operas remain extremely popular, especially the three peaks of his 'middle period': ''[[Rigoletto]], [[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'', and the 2013 bicentenary of his birth was widely celebrated in broadcasts and performances.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood and education===\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi casa natale.jpg|thumb|left|Verdi's childhood home at Le Roncole<!--Verdi was not born here, see Rosselli, page 13.-->]]\nVerdi, the first child of Carlo Giuseppe Verdi (1785\u20131867) and Luigia Uttini (1787\u20131851), was born at their home in [[Le Roncole]], a village near [[Busseto]], then in the [[Taro (d\u00e9partement)|D\u00e9partement Taro]] and within the borders of  the [[First French Empire]] following the annexation of the [[Duchy of Parma and Piacenza]] in 1808. The baptismal register, prepared on 11 October 1813, lists his parents Carlo and Luigia as \"innkeeper\" and \"spinner\" respectively.  Additionally, it lists Verdi as being \"born yesterday\", but since days were often considered to begin at sunset, this could have meant either 9 or 10 October.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a72}} Following his mother, Verdi always celebrated his birthday on 9 October, the day he himself believed he was born.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=12}}\n\nVerdi had a younger sister, Giuseppa, who died aged 17 in 1833.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=12}} From the age of four, Verdi was given private lessons in Latin and Italian by the village schoolmaster, Baistrocchi, and at six he attended the local school. After learning to play the [[organ (music)|organ]], he showed so much interest in music that his parents finally provided him with a [[spinet]].{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=14}} Verdi's gift for music was already apparent by 1820\u201321 when he began his association with the local church, serving in the choir, acting as an [[altar boy]] for a while, and taking organ lessons. After Baistrocchi's death, Verdi, at the age of eight, became the official paid organist.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=17\u201321}}\n\n[[File:Ritratto di Antonio Barezzi.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Antonio Barezzi, Verdi's patron and later father-in-law]]The music historian [[Roger Parker]] points out that both of Verdi's parents \"belonged to families of small landowners and traders, certainly not the illiterate peasants from which Verdi later liked to present himself as having emerged... Carlo Verdi was energetic in furthering his son's education...something which Verdi tended to hide in later life... [T]he picture emerges of youthful precocity eagerly nurtured by an ambitious father and of a sustained, sophisticated and elaborate formal education.\"{{sfn|Parker|1998|p=933}}\n\nIn 1823, when he was 10, Verdi's parents arranged for the boy to attend school in Busseto, enrolling him in a ''Ginnasio''\u2014an upper school for boys\u2014run by Don Pietro Seletti, while they continued to run their inn at Le Roncole. Verdi returned to Busseto regularly to play the organ on Sundays, covering the distance of several kilometres on foot.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=20\u201321}} At age 11, Verdi received schooling in Italian, Latin, the humanities, and rhetoric. By the time he was 12, he began lessons with [[Ferdinando Provesi]], ''maestro di cappella'' at San Bartolomeo, director of the municipal music school and co-director of the local ''Societ\u00e0 Filarmonica'' (Philharmonic Society). Verdi later stated: \"From the ages of 13 to 18 I wrote a motley assortment of pieces: marches for band by the hundred, perhaps as many little ''sinfonie'' that were used in church, in the theatre and at concerts, five or six [[concerto]]s and sets of [[variation (music)|variations]] for pianoforte, which I played myself at concerts, many [[serenade]]s, [[cantata]]s ([[aria]]s, duets, very many trios) and various pieces of church music, of which I remember only a ''[[Stabat Mater]]''.\"{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a72}} This information comes from the ''Autobiographical Sketch'' which Verdi dictated to the publisher [[Giulio Ricordi]] late in life, in 1879, and remains the leading source for his early life and career.{{sfn|Kimbell|1981|p=92}} Written, understandably, with the benefit of hindsight, it is not always reliable when dealing with issues more contentious than those of his childhood.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=2\u20133}}{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a73}}\n\n[[File:Margherita barezzi2-1-.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Margherita Barezzi, Verdi's first wife]]The other director of the Philharmonic Society was {{Interlanguage link multi|Antonio Barezzi|it}}, a wholesale grocer and distiller, who was described by a contemporary as a \"manic dilettante\" of music. The young Verdi did not immediately become involved with the Philharmonic. By June 1827, he had graduated with honours from the ''Ginnasio'' and was able to focus solely on music under Provesi. By chance, when he was 13, Verdi was asked to step in as a replacement to play in what became his first public event in his home town; he was an immediate success mostly playing his own music to the surprise of many and receiving strong local recognition.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=27\u201330}}\n\nBy 1829\u201330, Verdi had established himself as a leader of the Philharmonic: \"none of us could rival him\" reported the secretary of the organisation, Giuseppe Demald\u00e8. An eight-movement cantata, ''I deliri di Saul'', based on a drama by [[Vittorio Alfieri]], was written by Verdi when he was 15 and performed in [[Bergamo]]. It was acclaimed by both Demald\u00e8 and Barezzi, who commented: \"He shows a vivid imagination, a philosophical outlook, and sound judgment in the arrangement of instrumental parts.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=32}} In late 1829, Verdi had completed his studies with Provesi, who declared that he had no more to teach him.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=35}} At the time, Verdi had been giving singing and piano lessons to Barezzi's daughter Margherita; by 1831, they were unofficially engaged.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a72}}\n\nVerdi set his sights on Milan, then the cultural capital of northern Italy, where he applied unsuccessfully to study at the [[Milan Conservatory|Conservatory]].{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a72}} Barezzi made arrangements for him to become a private pupil of {{Interlanguage link multi|Vincenzo Lavigna|it}}, who had been ''maestro concertatore'' at [[La Scala]], and who described Verdi's compositions as \"very promising.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=46}} Lavigna encouraged Verdi to take out a subscription to La Scala, where he heard [[Maria Malibran]] in operas by [[Gioachino Rossini]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]].{{sfn|Parker|2007|p=1}} Verdi began making connections in the Milanese world of music that were to stand him in good stead. These included an introduction by Lavigna to an amateur choral group, the ''Societ\u00e0 Filarmonica'', led by Pietro Massini.{{sfn|Werfel|Stefan|1973|pp=80\u201393}} Attending the ''Societ\u00e0'' frequently in 1834, Verdi soon found himself functioning as rehearsal director (for Rossini's ''[[La cenerentola]]'') and continuo player. It was Massini who encouraged him to write his first opera, originally titled ''Rocester'', to a libretto by the journalist Antonio Piazza.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a72}}\n\n===1834\u20131842: First operas===\n[[Image:Temistocle Solera.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Temistocle Solera]], Verdi's first librettist.]] [[List of compositions by Giuseppe Verdi]]\nIn mid-1834, Verdi sought to acquire Provesi's former post in Busseto but without success.  But with Barezzi's help he did obtain the secular post of ''maestro di musica''. He taught, gave lessons, and conducted the Philharmonic for several months before returning to Milan in early 1835.{{sfn|Parker|1998|p=933}} By the following July, he obtained his certification from Lavigna.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=67}} Eventually in 1835 Verdi became director of the Busseto school with a three-year contract. He married Margherita in May 1836, and by March 1837, she had given birth to their first child, Virginia Maria Luigia on 26 March 1837. Icilio Romano followed on 11 July 1838. Both the children died young, Virginia on 12 August 1838, Ilicio on 22 October 1839.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a72}}\n\nIn 1837, the young composer asked for Massini's assistance to stage his opera in Milan.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=79\u201380}} The La Scala impresario, [[Bartolomeo Merelli]],  agreed to put on ''[[Oberto (opera)|Oberto]]'' (as the reworked opera was now called, with a libretto rewritten by [[Temistocle Solera]]){{sfn|Kimbell|1981|pp=92, 96}} in November 1839. It achieved a respectable 13 additional performances, following which Merelli offered Verdi a contract for three more works.{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=71}}\n\nWhile Verdi was working on his second opera ''[[Un giorno di regno]]'', Margherita died of [[encephalitis]] at the age of 26. Verdi adored his wife and children and was devastated by their deaths. ''Un giorno'', a comedy, was premiered only a few months later. It was a flop and only given the one performance.{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=71}} Following its failure, it is claimed Verdi vowed never to compose again,{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a73}} but in his ''Sketch'' he recounts how Merelli persuaded him to write a new opera.\n\nVerdi was to claim that he gradually began to work on the music for ''[[Nabucco]]'', the libretto of which had originally been rejected by the composer [[Otto Nicolai]]:{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=16}} \"This verse today, tomorrow that, here a note, there a whole phrase, and little by little the opera was written\", he later recalled.{{sfn|Werfel|Stefan|1973|pp=87\u201392}} By the autumn of 1841 it was complete, originally under the title ''Nabucodonosor''. Well received at its first performance on 9 March 1842, ''Nabucco'' underpinned Verdi's success until his retirement from the theatre, twenty-nine operas (including some revised and updated versions) later.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a73}} At its revival in La Scala for the 1842 autumn season it was given an unprecedented (and later unequalled) total of 57 performances; within three years it had reached (among other venues) Vienna, Lisbon, Barcelona, Berlin, Paris and Hamburg; in 1848 it was heard in New York, in 1850 in Buenos Aires. Porter comments that \"similar accounts...could be provided to show how widely and rapidly all [Verdi's] other successful operas were disseminated.\"{{sfn|Porter|1980|pp=638\u201339}}\n\n===1842\u201349===\n[[File:Francesco Maria Piave - Granger.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Francesco Maria Piave]] whose work with Verdi included ''Rigoletto'' and ''La traviata'']]\nA period of hard work for Verdi\u2014with the creation of twenty operas (excluding revisions and translations)\u2014followed over the next sixteen years, culminating in ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''. This period was not without its frustrations and setbacks for the young composer, and he was frequently demoralised. In April 1845, in connection with ''[[I due Foscari]]'', he wrote: \"I am happy, no matter what reception it gets, and I am utterly indifferent to everything. I cannot wait for these next three years to pass. I have to write six operas, then ''addio'' to everything.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=181}} In 1858 Verdi complained: \"Since ''Nabucco'', you may say, I have never had one hour of peace. Sixteen years in the galleys.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=379}}\n\nAfter the initial success of ''Nabucco'', Verdi settled in Milan, making a number of influential acquaintances.  He attended the ''Salotto Maffei'', Countess [[Clara Maffei]]'s [[salon (gathering)|salon]]s in Milan, becoming her lifelong friend and correspondent.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a73}} A revival of ''Nabucco'' followed in 1842 at La Scala where it received a run of fifty-seven performances,{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=139}} and this led to a commission from Merelli for a new opera for the 1843 season. ''[[I Lombardi alla prima crociata]]'' was based on a libretto by Solera and premiered in February 1843. Inevitably, comparisons were made with ''Nabucco''; but one contemporary writer noted: \"If [''Nabucco''] created this young man's reputation, ''I Lombardi'' served to confirm it.\"{{sfn|Budden|1984a|p=116}}\n\nVerdi paid close attention to his financial contracts, making sure he was appropriately remunerated as his popularity increased. For ''I Lombardi'' and ''[[Ernani]]'' (1844) in Venice he was paid 12,000 lire (including supervision of the productions); ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'' and ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'' (1847), each brought him 18,000 lire. His contracts with the publishers [[Casa Ricordi|Ricordi]] in 1847 were very specific about the amounts he was to receive for new works, first productions, musical arrangements, and so on.{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=649}} He began to use his growing prosperity to invest in land near his birthplace. In 1844 he purchased Il Pulgaro, 62 acres (23 hectares) of farmland with a farmhouse and outbuildings, providing a home for his parents from May 1844. Later that year, he also bought the Palazzo Cavalli (now known as the Palazzo Orlandi) on the via Roma, Busseto's main street.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=160\u201361}} In May 1848, Verdi signed a contract for land and houses at Sant'Agata in Busseto, which had once belonged to his family.{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=45}} It was here he built his own house, completed in 1880, now known as the [[Villa Verdi]], where he lived from 1851 until his death.<ref>[http://www.villaverdi.org/pagine/en.php \"Story\"] on Villa Verdi website, accessed 10 June 2015.</ref>\n[[File:Giuseppina Strepponi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Giuseppina Strepponi]] (c. 1845)]]\nIn March 1843, Verdi visited Vienna (where [[Gaetano Donizetti]] was musical director) to oversee a production of ''Nabucco''. The older composer, recognising Verdi's talent, noted in a letter of January 1844: \"I am very, very happy to give way to people of talent like Verdi... Nothing will prevent the good Verdi from soon reaching one of the most honourable positions in the cohort of composers.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=148}} Verdi travelled on to Parma, where the [[Teatro Regio di Parma]] was producing ''Nabucco'' with Strepponi in the cast. For Verdi the performances were a personal triumph in his native region, especially as his father, Carlo, attended the first performance. Verdi remained in Parma for some weeks beyond his intended departure date. This fuelled speculation that the delay was due to Verdi's interest in [[Giuseppina Strepponi]] (who stated that their relationship began in 1843).{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=150\u201351}} Strepponi was in fact known for her amorous relationships (and many illegitimate children) and her history was an awkward factor in their relationship until they eventually agreed on marriage.{{sfn|Kerman|2006|p=23}}\n\nAfter successful stagings of ''Nabucco'' in Venice (with twenty-five performances in the 1842/43 season), Verdi began negotiations with the impresario of [[La Fenice]] to stage ''I Lombardi'', and to write a new opera.  Eventually, Victor Hugo's ''[[Hernani (drama)|Hernani]]'' was chosen, with [[Francesco Maria Piave]] as librettist. ''[[Ernani]]'' was successfully premiered in 1844, and within six months had been performed at twenty other theatres in Italy, and also in Vienna.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=52}} The writer [[Andrew Porter (music critic)|Andrew Porter]] notes that for the next ten years, Verdi's life \"reads like a travel diary\u2014a timetable of visits...to bring new operas to the stage or to supervise local premieres.\" La Scala premiered none of these new works, except for ''Giovanna d'Arco''. Verdi \"never forgave the Milanese for their reception of ''Un giorno di regno''.\"{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=649}}\n\nDuring this period, Verdi began to work more consistently with his librettists. He relied on Piave again for ''I due Foscari'', performed in Rome in November 1844, then on Solera once more for ''[[Giovanna d'Arco]]'', at La Scala in February 1845, while in August that year he was able to work with [[Salvadore Cammarano]] on ''[[Alzira (opera)|Alzira]]'' for the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] in Naples. Solera and Piave worked together on ''[[Attila]]'' for La Fenice (March 1846).{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a74}}\n[[File:Emanuele Muzio-Verdi's pupil & assistant.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Emanuele Muzio]], Verdi's pupil and assistant]]\nIn April 1844, Verdi took on [[Emanuele Muzio]], eight years his junior, as a pupil and [[amanuensis]]. He had known him since about 1828 as another of Barezzi's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=160}} Muzio, who in fact was Verdi's only pupil, became indispensable to the composer. He reported to Barezzi that Verdi \"has a breadth of spirit, of generosity, a wisdom.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=166}} In November 1846, Muzio wrote of Verdi: \"If you could see us, I seem more like a friend, rather than his pupil. We are always together at dinner, in the cafes, when we play cards...; all in all, he doesn't go anywhere without me at his side; in the house we have a big table and we both write there together, and so I always have his advice.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=192\u201393}} Muzio was to remain associated with Verdi, assisting in the preparation of scores and transcriptions, and later conducting many of his works in their premiere performances in the US and elsewhere outside Italy. He was chosen by Verdi as one of the executors of his will, but predeceased the composer in 1890.{{sfn|Marchesi|n.d.|p=}}\n\nAfter a period of illness Verdi began work on ''Macbeth'' in September 1846. He dedicated the opera to Barezzi: \"I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as you have been a father, a benefactor and a friend for me.

In the spirit of the time were the [[tenor]] hero's final words, \"Whoever dies for the fatherland cannot be evil-minded\".{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nVerdi had intended to return to Italy in early 1848, but was prevented by work and illness, as well as, most probably, by his increasing attachment to Strepponi. Verdi and Strepponi left Paris in July 1849, the immediate cause being an outbreak of [[cholera]],{{sfn|Walker|1962|p=194}} and Verdi went directly to Busseto to continue work on completing his latest opera, ''[[Luisa Miller]]'', for a production in Naples later in the year.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=89}}\n\n===1849\u201353: Fame===\n[[File:Villa Verdi at Sant'Agata-1859-65.jpg|upright=1|thumb|right|Villa Verdi at Sant'Agata, as it looked between 1859 and 1865]]Verdi was committed to the publisher [[Giovanni Ricordi]] for an opera\u2014which became ''[[Stiffelio]]''\u2014for Trieste in the Spring of 1850; and, subsequently, following negotiations with La Fenice, developed a libretto with Piave and wrote the music for ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (based on [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Le roi s'amuse]]'') for Venice in March 1851. This was the first of a sequence of three operas (followed by ''[[Il trovatore]]'' and ''[[La traviata]]'') which were to cement his fame as a master of opera.{{sfn|Newark|2004|p=198}}\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n| filename = La Traviata - Act 1 - Libiamo ne' lieti calici.ogg\n| title = \"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\" (3:03)\n| description = The famous drinking duet from La Traviata\n}}The failure of ''Stiffelio'' (attributable not least to the censors of the time taking offence at the taboo subject of the supposed adultery of a clergyman's wife and interfering with the text and roles) incited Verdi to take pains to rework it, although even in the completely recycled version of ''[[Aroldo]]'' (1857) it still failed to please.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=90\u201391}} ''Rigoletto'', with its intended murder of royalty, and its sordid attributes, also upset the censors. Verdi would not compromise: <blockquote>What does the sack matter to the police? Are they worried about the effect it will produce?...Do they think they know better than I?...I see the hero has been made no longer ugly and hunchbacked!! Why?  A singing hunchback...why not?...I think it splendid to show this character as outwardly deformed and ridiculous, and inwardly passionate and full of love.

These stemmed from the way in which the citizens of Busseto were treating Giuseppina Strepponi, with whom he was living openly in an unmarried relationship. She was shunned in the town and at church, and while Verdi appeared indifferent, she was certainly not.{{sfn|Walker|1962|pp=197\u201398}} Furthermore, Verdi was concerned about the administration of his newly acquired property at Sant'Agata.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=287}} A growing estrangement between Verdi and his parents was perhaps also attributable to Strepponi{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=290}} (the suggestion that this situation was sparked by the birth of a child to Verdi and Strepponi which was given away as a foundling{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=289\u2013}} lacks any firm evidence). In January 1851, Verdi broke off relations with his parents, and in April they were  ordered to leave Sant'Agata; Verdi found new premises for them and helped them financially to settle into their new home. It may not be coincidental that all six Verdi operas written in the period 1849\u201353 (''La battaglia, Luisa Miller, Stiffelio, Rigoletto, Il trovatore'' and ''La traviata''), have, uniquely in his oeuvre, heroines who are, in the opera critic Joseph Kerman's words, \"women who come to grief because of sexual transgression, actual or perceived\". Kerman, like the psychologist Gerald Mendelssohn, sees this choice of subjects as being influenced by Verdi's uneasy passion for Strepponi.{{sfn|Kerman|2006|pp=22\u201323}}\n\nVerdi and Strepponi moved into Sant'Agata on 1 May 1851.{{sfn|Walker|1962|p=199}} May also brought an offer for a new opera from La Fenice, which Verdi eventually realised as ''La traviata''. That was followed by an agreement with the Rome Opera company to present ''Il trovatore'' for January 1853.{{sfn|Budden|1984b|p=63}} Verdi now had sufficient earnings to retire, should he have wished to do so.{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=54}} He had reached a stage where he could develop his operas as he wished, rather than be dependent on commissions from third parties.  ''Il trovatore'' was in fact the first opera he wrote without a specific commission (apart from ''Oberto'').{{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=3}} At around the same time he began to consider creating an opera from Shakespeare's ''[[King Lear]]''. After first (1850) seeking a libretto from Cammarano (which never appeared), Verdi later (1857) commissioned one from [[Antonio Somma]], but this proved intractable, and no music was ever written.{{sfn|Budden|1993|pp=70\u201371}}{{#tag:ref|After ''Falstaff'', Boito commented to Verdi \"Now, maestro, we must set to work on ''King Lear''\" (for which Boito had prepared a draft), but Giuseppina was horrified at this prospect: \"For heaven's sake, Boito, Verdi is too old, too tired\"{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=138}} In 1896, Verdi offered his Lear materials to [[Pietro Mascagni]] who asked \"Maestro, why didn't you put it into music?\" According to Mascagni, \"softly and slowly he replied, 'the scene in which King Lear finds himself on the heath scared me'\".{{sfn|Mendelsohn|1979|p=223}}|group=n}} Verdi began work on ''Il trovatore'' after the death of his mother in June 1851. The fact that this is \"the one opera of Verdi's which focuses on a mother rather than a father\" is perhaps related to her death.{{sfn|Mendelsohn|1979|p=226}}\n\nIn the winter of 1851\u201352 Verdi decided to go to Paris with Strepponi, where he concluded an agreement with the Op\u00e9ra to write what became ''[[Les v\u00eapres siciliennes]]'', his first original work in the style of [[grand opera]]. In February 1852, the couple attended a performance of [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Alexander Dumas]] ''fils'''s  play, ''[[The Lady of the Camellias]]''; Verdi immediately began to compose music for what would later become ''La traviata''.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=303}}\n\n{{Listen|type=music\n| filename    = Giuseppe Verdi - Anvil Chorus.ogg\n| title       = Coro di zingari (3:06)\n| description = [[Anvil Chorus]] from Il Trovatore\n}}After his visit to Rome for ''Il trovatore'' in January 1853, Verdi worked on completing ''La traviata'', but with little hope of its success, due to his lack of confidence in any of the singers engaged for the season.{{sfn|Walker|1962|p=212}} Furthermore, the management insisted that the opera be given a historical, not a contemporary setting. The premiere in March 1853 was indeed a failure: Verdi wrote: \"Was the fault mine or the singers'? Time will tell.\"{{sfn|Budden|1993|pp=62\u201363}}  Subsequent productions (following some rewriting) throughout Europe over the following two years fully vindicated the composer; Roger Parker has written \"''Il trovatore'' consistently remains one of the three or four most popular operas in the Verdian repertoire: but it has never pleased the critics\".{{sfn|Parker|1982|p=155}}\n\n===1853\u201360: Consolidation===\nIn the eleven years up to and including ''Traviata'', Verdi had written sixteen operas. Over the next eighteen years (up to ''Aida''), he wrote only six new works for the stage.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc= \u00a75}}  Verdi was happy to return to Sant'Agata and, in February 1856, was reporting a  \"total abandonment of music; a little reading; some light occupation with agriculture and horses; that's all\". A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: \"I'm not doing anything. I don't read. I don't write. I walk in the fields from morning to evening, trying to recover, so far without success, from the stomach trouble caused me by ''I vespri siciliani''. Cursed operas!\"{{sfn|Walker|1962|p=218}} An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher [[L\u00e9on Escudier]] describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: \"His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury\u2014anything you like that is exaggerated.  He gets up almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc....Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed.\"{{sfn|Walker|1962|p=219}}\n\nNonetheless on 15 May, Verdi signed a contract with La Fenice for an opera for the following spring. This was to be ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]''. The couple stayed in Paris until January 1857 to deal with these proposals, and also the offer to stage the translated version of ''Il trovatore'' as a grand opera. Verdi and Strepponi travelled to Venice in March for the premiere of ''Simon Boccanegra'', which turned out to be \"a fiasco\" (as Verdi reported, although on the second and third nights, the reception improved considerably).{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=355}}\n\n[[File:Verdi and Naples censor-caricature by Delfico.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Verdi confronting the Naples censor when preparing ''Un ballo in maschera'' (caricature by [[Melchiorre Delfico (caricaturist)|Delfico)]]]]With Strepponi, Verdi went to Naples early in January 1858 to work with Somma on the libretto of the opera ''Gustave III'', which over a year later would become ''[[Un ballo in maschera]]''. By this time, Verdi had begun to write about Strepponi as \"my wife\" and she was signing her letters as \"Giuseppina Verdi\".{{sfn|Walker|1962|p=219}} Verdi raged against the stringent requirements of the Neapolitan censor stating: \"I'm drowning in a sea of troubles. It's almost certain that the censors will forbid our libretto.\"{{sfn|Werfel|Stefan|1973|p=207}} With no hope of seeing his ''Gustavo III'' staged as written, he broke his contract. This resulted in litigation and counter-litigation; with the legal issues resolved, Verdi was free to present the libretto and musical outline of ''Gustave III'' to the [[Teatro dell'Opera di Roma|Rome Opera]]. There, the censors demanded further changes; at this point, the opera took the title ''Un ballo in maschera''.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=116\u201317}}\n\nArriving in Sant'Agata in March 1859 Verdi and Strepponi found the nearby city of [[Piacenza]] occupied by about 6,000 Austrian troops who had made it their base, to combat the rise of Italian interest in unification in the Piedmont region. In the ensuing [[Second Italian War of Independence]] the Austrians abandoned the region and began to leave Lombardy, although they remained in control of the Venice region under the terms of the armistice signed at [[Villafranca di Verona|Villafranca]]. Verdi was disgusted at this outcome: \"[W]here then is the independence of Italy, so long hoped for and promised?...Venice is not Italian? After so many victories, what an outcome... It is enough to drive one mad\" he wrote to Clara Maffei.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=394}}\n\nVerdi and Strepponi now decided on marriage; they travelled to [[Collonges-sous-Sal\u00e8ve]], a village then part of Piedmont. On 29 August 1859 the couple were married there, with only the coachman who had driven them there and the church bell-ringer as witnesses.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=70}} At the end of 1859, Verdi wrote to his friend [[Cesare De Sanctis (businessman)|Cesare De Sanctis]] \"[Since completing ''Ballo''] I have not made any more music, I have not seen any more music, I have not thought anymore about music. I don't even know what colour my last opera is, and I almost don't remember it.\" {{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=405}} He began to remodel Sant'Agata, which took most of 1860 to complete and on which he continued to work for the next twenty years.

As encores were expressly forbidden by the government at the time, such a gesture would have been extremely significant.

They were enthusiastically greeted along the way and in Turin Verdi himself received much of the publicity. On 17 October Verdi met with [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]], the architect of the initial stages of Italian unification.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=400\u201302}} Later that year the government of Emilia was subsumed under the [[United Provinces of Central Italy]], and Verdi's political life temporarily came to an end. Whilst still maintaining nationalist feelings, he declined in 1860 the office of provincial council member to which he had been elected ''in absentia''.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|p=417}} Cavour however was anxious to convince a man of Verdi's stature that running for political office was essential to strengthening and securing Italy's future.{{sfn|Gossett|2012|p=281}} The composer confided to Piave some years later that \"I accepted on the condition that after a few months I would resign.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=429\u201330}} Verdi was elected on 3 February 1861 for the town of Borgo San Donnino ([[Fidenza]]) to the Parliament of [[Piedmont-Sardinia]] in Turin (which from March 1861 became the Parliament of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]), but following the death of Cavour in 1861, which deeply distressed him, he scarcely attended.{{sfn|Gossett|2012|p=282}} Later, in 1874, Verdi was appointed a member of the [[Italian Senate]], but did not participate in its activities.{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=653}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Senato del Regno|issue=Num. 340|publisher=Gazzetta Piemontese|date=10 December 1874|language=Italian|quote=(Article stating the Italian Senate voted to approve Verdi's nomination on 8 Nov. 1874)}}</ref>\n\n===1860\u201387: from ''La forza'' to ''Otello''===\n[[File:Verdi Russia 1861-62.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Verdi in Russia, 1861\u201362]]\nIn the months following the staging of ''Ballo'', Verdi was approached by several opera companies seeking a new work or making offers to stage one of his existing ones, but refused them all.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=439\u201346}} But when, in December 1860, an approach was made from [[Saint Petersburg]]'s [[Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre|Imperial Theatre]], the offer of 60,000 francs plus all expenses was doubtless a strong incentive. Verdi came up with the idea of adapting the 1835 Spanish play ''Don Alvaro o la fuerza del sino'' by [[Angel Saavedra]], which became ''[[La forza del destino]]'', with Piave writing the libretto. The Verdis arrived in St. Petersburg in December 1861 for the premiere, but casting problems meant that it had to be postponed.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=124}}\n\nReturning via Paris from Russia on 24 February 1862, Verdi met two young Italian writers, the twenty-year-old [[Arrigo Boito]] and [[Franco Faccio]].

Boito, as a supporter of the grand opera of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]] and an opera composer in his own right, was later in the 1860s critical of Verdi's \"reliance on formula rather than form\", incurring the composer's wrath. Nevertheless, he was to become Verdi's close collaborator in his final operas.{{sfn|Parker|2007|pp=3\u20134}} The St. Petersburg premiere of ''La forza'' finally took place in September 1862, and Verdi received the [[Order of Saint Stanislaus (Imperial House of Romanov)|Order of St. Stanislaus]].{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=88}}\n\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Triumphal March from Aida.ogg|title=''Grand March'' from Aida|description=The Grand March from the Act 2 of Aida}}A revival of ''Macbeth'' in Paris in 1865 was not a success, but he obtained a commission for a new work, ''[[Don Carlos]]'', based on the [[Don Carlos (play)|drama, ''Don Carlos'']] by [[Friedrich Schiller]].

He compiled and completed the requiem, but its performance was abandoned (and its premiere did not take place until 1988).{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=138\u201339}} Five years later, Verdi reworked his \"Libera Me\" section of the Rossini Requiem and made it a part of his Requiem honouring Alessandro Manzoni, who had died in 1873. The complete Requiem was first performed at the cathedral in Milan on the anniversary of Manzoni's death on 22 May 1874.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=138\u201339}} The ''[[spinto]]'' soprano [[Teresa Stolz]] (1834\u20131902), who had sung in La Scala productions from 1865 onwards, was the soloist in the first and many later performances of the Requiem; in February 1872, she had created Aida in its European premiere in Milan. She became closely associated personally with Verdi (exactly how closely remains conjectural), to Giuseppina Verdi's initial disquiet; but the women were reconciled and Stolz remained a companion of Verdi after Giuseppina's death in 1897 until his own death.{{sfn|Christiansen|1995|pp=202\u201303}}\n\nVerdi conducted his Requiem in Paris, London and Vienna in 1875 and in Cologne in 1876.{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=653}} It seemed that it would be his last work. In the words of his biographer John Rosselli, it \"confirmed him as the unique presiding genius of Italian music. No fellow composer...came near him in popularity or reputation\". Verdi, now in his sixties, initially seemed to withdraw into retirement. He deliberately shied away from opportunities to publicise himself or to become involved with new productions of his works,{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=163\u201365}} but secretly he began work on ''[[Otello]]'', which Boito (to whom the composer had been reconciled by Ricordi) had proposed to him privately in 1879. The composition was delayed by a revision of ''Simon Boccanegra'' which Verdi undertook with Boito, produced in 1881, and a revision of ''Don Carlos''. Even when ''Otello'' was virtually completed, Verdi teased \"Shall I finish it? Shall I have it performed? Hard to tell, even for me.\" As news leaked out, Verdi was pressed by opera houses across Europe with enquiries; eventually the opera was triumphantly premiered at La Scala in February 1887.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=164\u201372}}\n\n===1887\u20131901: ''Falstaff'' and last years===\n[[File:Boito e Verdi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arrigo Boito]] and Verdi at Sant'Agata in 1893]]\nFollowing the success of ''Otello'' Verdi commented, \"After having relentlessly massacred so many heroes and heroines, I have at last the right to laugh a little.\" He had considered a variety of comic subjects but had found none of them wholly suitable and confided his ambition to Boito. The librettist said nothing at the time but secretly began work on a libretto based on ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' with additional material taken from ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2|Part 2]]''.{{sfn|Klein|1926|p=606}} Verdi received the draft libretto probably in early July 1889 after he had just read Shakespeare's play: \"Benissimo! Benissimo!... No one could have done better than you\", he wrote back to Boito. But he still had doubts: his age, his health (which he admits to being good) and his ability to complete the project: \"If I were not to finish the music?\". If the project failed, it would have been a waste of Boito's time, and have distracted him from completing his own new opera. Finally on 10 July 1889 he wrote again: \"So be it! So let's do ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]''! For now, let's not think of obstacles, of age, of illnesses!\" Verdi emphasised the need for secrecy, but continued \"If you are in the mood, then start to write.\"{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|1993|pp=700\u201301}} Later he wrote to Boito (capitals and exclamation marks are Verdi's own): \"What joy to be able to say to the public: HERE WE ARE AGAIN!!! COME AND SEE US!\"{{sfn|Mendelsohn|1978|p=122}}\n\nThe first performance of ''Falstaff'' took place at La Scala on 9 February 1893. For the first night, official ticket prices were thirty times higher than usual. Royalty, aristocracy, critics and leading figures from the arts all over Europe were present. The performance was a huge success; numbers were encored, and at the end the applause for Verdi and the cast lasted an hour. That was followed by a tumultuous welcome when the composer, his wife and Boito arrived at the [[Grand Hotel et de Milan|Grand Hotel de Milan]].{{sfn|Hepokoski|1983|pp=55\u201356}} Even more hectic scenes ensued when he went to Rome in May for the opera's premiere at the [[Teatro Costanzi]], when crowds of well-wishers at the railway station initially forced Verdi to take refuge in a tool-shed.

A huge crowd was in attendance, estimated at 300,000.{{sfn|Phillips-Matz|2004|p=14}} Boito wrote to a friend, in words which recall the mysterious final scene of ''Don Carlos'', \"[Verdi] sleeps like a King of Spain in his [[El Escorial|Escurial]], under a bronze slab that completely covers him.\"{{sfn|Walker|1962|p=509}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Personality==\nNot all of Verdi's personal qualities were amiable. John Rosselli concluded after writing his biography that \"I do not very much like the man Verdi, in particular the autocratic [[wikt:rentier|rentier]]-cum-estate owner, part-time composer, and seemingly full-time grumbler and reactionary critic of the later years\", yet admits that like other writers, he must \"admire him, warts and all...a deep integrity runs beneath his life, and can be felt even when he is being unreasonable or wrong.\"{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=7}}\n\nBudden suggests that \"With Verdi...the man and the artist on many ways developed side by side.\" Ungainly and awkward in society in his early years, \"as he became a man of property and underwent the civilizing influence of Giuseppina,...[he] acquired assurance and authority.\"{{sfn|Budden|1993|pp=148\u201349}} He also learnt to keep himself to himself, never discussing his private life and maintaining when it suited his convenience legends about his supposed 'peasant' origins, his materialism and his indifference to criticism.{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=153}} Mendelsohn describes the composer as \"an intensely private man who deeply resented efforts to inquire into his personal affairs. He regarded journalists and would-be biographers, as well as his neighbors in Busseto and the operatic public at large, as an intrusive lot, against whose prying attentions he needed constantly to defend himself.\"{{sfn|Mendelsohn|1978|p=110}}\n\nVerdi was similarly never explicit about his religious beliefs. Anti-clerical by nature in his early years,{{sfn|Budden|1993|pp=2\u20133, 9\u201310}} he nonetheless built a chapel at Sant'Agata, but is rarely recorded as going to church. Strepponi wrote in 1871 \"I won't say [Verdi] is an atheist, but he is not much of a believer.\"{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=161}} Rosselli comments that in the Requiem \"The prospect of Hell appears to rule...[the Requiem] is troubled to the end,\" and offers little consolation.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=162\u201363}}\n\n==Music and form==\n[[File:Giuseppe Verdi 1879 Vanity Fair illustration by Th\u00e9obald Chartran.jpg|thumb|upright|Giuseppe Verdi in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK)|Vanity Fair]]'' (1879)]]''See also [[List of compositions by Giuseppe Verdi]] and individual articles on the works.''\n\n===Spirit===\nThe writer Friedrich Schiller (four of whose plays were adapted as operas by Verdi) distinguished two types of artist in his 1795 essay ''[[On Na\u00efve and Sentimental Poetry]]''. The philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]] ranked Verdi in the 'na\u00efve' category\u2014\"They are not...self-conscious. They do not...stand aside to contemplate their creations and express their own feelings....They are able...if they have genius, to embody their vision fully.\" (The 'sentimentals' seek to recreate nature and natural feelings on their own terms\u2014Berlin instances Wagner\u2014\"offering not peace, but a sword.\"){{sfn|Berlin|1979|pp=3\u20134}} Verdi's operas are not written according to an aesthetic theory, or with a purpose to change the tastes of their audiences. In conversation with a German visitor in 1887 he is recorded as saying that, whilst \"there was much to be admired in [Wagner's operas] ''[[Tannh\u00e4user (opera)|Tannh\u00e4user]]'' and ''[[Lohengrin]]''...in his recent operas [Wagner] seemed to be overstepping the bounds of what can be expressed in  music. For him \"philosophical\" music was incomprehensible.\"{{sfn|Conati|1986|p=147}} Although Verdi's works belong, as Rosselli admits \"to the most artificial of genres...[they] ring emotionally true: truth and directness make them exciting, often hugely so.\"{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=1}}\n\nThat is not to say his operas did not come as great innovations. What sounds to a modern listener as derivative of the bel canto, his first major success, ''[[Nabucco]]'', came as a something entirely new. Never before had opera been so harmonically complex and direct. No longer was there the empty vocal display of the [[bel canto]] period composers. Granted, there is a significant amount of vocal fireworks, but they exist for the purpose of drama, not to show off singers. Aside from this, his use of the chorus was entirely new. Before ''Nabucco'', an opera's chorus was limited to be only a background voice, another instrument. In Nabucco, this is abolished; he uses the chorus as character, to show the suffering and consensus of the people. The famous \"Va, pensiero\" is an example of this.\n\nThe first of his \"big three\" operas, ''[[Rigoletto]]'', followed by ''[[La traviata|La Traviata]]'', and ending with ''[[Il trovatore|Il Trovatore]]'', also was revolutionary. In a letter to ''Rigoletto''<nowiki/>'s librettist, [[Francesco Maria Piave]], he says, \"I conceived ''[[Rigoletto]]'' almost without arias, without finales but only an unending string of duets.\" And that it is. Rigoletto is one of, if not the earliest operas to abandon the traditional distinction between the sung aria, and the more speech-like recitative.\n\nAfter these three operas, his works took an increasing amount of time to finish, were significantly longer, and more masterfully orchestrated.\n\n===Periods===\nThe earliest study of Verdi's music, published in 1859 by the Italian critic Abraham Basevi, already distinguished four periods in Verdi's music. The early, 'grandiose' period, ended according to Basevi with ''La battaglia di Legnano'' (1849), and a 'personal' style began with the next opera ''Luisa Miller.'' These two operas are generally agreed today by critics to mark the division between Verdi's 'early' and 'middle' periods. The 'middle' period is felt to end with ''La traviata'' (1853) and ''[[Les v\u00eapres siciliennes]]'' (1855), with a 'late' period commencing with ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' (1857) running through to ''[[Aida]]'' (1871). The last two operas, ''[[Otello]]'' and ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'', together with the [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]] and the ''Four Sacred Pieces,'' then represent a 'final' period.{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=639}}\n\n====Early period====\nVerdi was to claim in his ''Sketch'' that during his early training with Lavigna \"I did nothing but [[canon (music)|canons]] and [[fugue]]s...No-one taught me [[orchestration]] or how to handle dramatic music.\"{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=636}} He is known to have written a variety of music for the Busseto Philharmonic society, including vocal music, band music and chamber works,{{sfn|Porter|1980|p=637}} (and including an alternative overture to Rossini's ''[[Barber of Seville]]''){{sfn|Budden|1993|p=5}}  but few of these works survive. (He may have given instructions before his death to destroy his early works).{{sfn|Gossett|2008|p=161}}\n\n[[File:Macbeth-meets the witches.jpg|thumb|left|Macbeth meets the witches (Act I, scene 1)]]Verdi uses in his early operas (and, in his own stylized versions, throughout his later work) the standard elements of Italian opera content of the period, referred to by the opera writer [[Julian Budden]] as the 'Code Rossini', after the composer who established through his work and popularity the accepted templates of these forms; they were also used by the composers dominant during Verdi's early career, Bellini, Donizetti and [[Saverio Mercadante]]. Amongst the essential elements are the [[aria]], the [[duet]], the ensemble, and the [[finale (music)|finale]] sequence of an act.{{sfn|Taruskin|2010|pp=15\u201316}} The aria format, centred on a soloist, typically involved three sections;  a slow introduction, marked typically [[cantabile]] or [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]], a ''tempo di mezzo'' which might involve chorus or other characters, and a [[cabaletta]], an opportunity for [[bravura]] singing for the soloist. The duet was similarly formatted. Finales, covering climactic sequences of action, used the various forces of soloists, ensemble and chorus, usually culminating with an exciting [[stretto]] section. Verdi was to develop these and the other formulae of the generation preceding him with increasing sophistication during his career. {{sfn|Balthazar|2004|pp=49\u201359}}{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a74 (ii)}}\n\nThe operas of the early period show Verdi learning by doing and gradually establishing mastery over the different elements of opera. ''Oberto'' is poorly structured, and the orchestration of the first operas is generally simple, sometimes even basic.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a74 (vii)}} The musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] suggests \"the most striking effect in the early Verdi operas, and the one most obviously allied to the mood of the Risorgimento, was the big choral number sung\u2014crudely or sublimely, according to the ear of the beholder\u2014in [[unison]]. The success of \"Va, pensiero\" in ''Nabucco'' (which Rossini approvingly denoted as \"a grand aria sung by sopranos, contraltos, tenors and basses\"), was replicated in the similar \"O Signor, dal tetto natio\" in ''I lombardi'' and in 1844 in the chorus \"Si ridesti il Leon di Castiglia\" in ''Ernani'', the battle hymn of the conspirators seeking freedom{{sfn|Taruskin|2010|pp=570\u201375}}{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=21}} In ''I due Foscari'' Verdi first uses recurring themes identified with main characters; here and in future operas the accent moves away from the '[[oratorio]]' characteristics of the first operas towards individual action and intrigue.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a74 (vii)}}\n\nFrom this period onwards Verdi also develops his instinct for \"tinta\" (literally 'colour'), a term which he used for characterising elements of an individual opera score\u2014Parker gives as an example \"the rising [[Major sixth|6th]] that begins so many lyric pieces in ''[[Ernani]]''\".{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a74 (iv)}} ''[[Macbeth (opera)|Macbeth]]'', even in its original 1847 version, shows many original touches; characterization by [[key (music)|key]] (the Macbeths themselves generally singing in [[sharp (music)|sharp]] keys, the witches in [[flat (music)|flat]] keys),{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a74 (iv)}} a preponderance of [[minor key]] music, and highly original orchestration. In the 'dagger scene' and the duet following the murder of Duncan, the  forms transcend the 'Code Rossini' and propel the drama in a compelling fashion.{{sfn|Budden|1993|pp=190\u201392}} Verdi was to comment in 1868 that Rossini and his followers missed \"the golden thread that binds all the parts together and, rather than a set of numbers without coherence, makes an opera.\" ''Tinta'' was for Verdi this \"golden thread\", an essential unifying factor in his works.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=95}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Middle period====\n[[File:Rigoletto premiere stage set for Act 1, Scene 2.jpg|thumb|Stage set by Giuseppe Bertoja for the premiere of ''Rigoletto'' (Act 1, Scene 2)]]\nThe writer David Kimbell states that in ''Luisa Miller'' and ''Stiffelio'' (the earliest operas of this period) there appears to be a \"growing freedom in the large scale structure...and an acute attention to fine detail.\"{{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=1}} Others echo those feelings. Julian Budden expresses the impact of ''Rigoletto'' and its place in Verdi's output as follows: \"Just after 1850 at the age of 38, Verdi closed the door on a period of Italian opera with ''Rigoletto''. The so-called ''ottocento'' in music is finished. Verdi will continue to draw on certain of its forms for the next few operas, but in a totally new spirit.\"{{sfn|Budden|1984a|p=510}} One example of Verdi's wish to move away from \"standard forms\" appears in his feelings about the structure of ''Il trovatore''. To his librettist, Cammarano, Verdi plainly states in a letter of April 1851 that if there were no standard forms\u2014\"cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc. ... and if you could avoid beginning with an opening chorus....\", he would be quite happy. {{sfn|Budden|1984b|p=61}}\n\nTwo external factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. One is that with increasing reputation and financial security he no longer needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and had more time to develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.{{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=3}}\n\nAnother factor was the changed political situation; the failure of the 1848 revolutions led both to some diminution of the Risorgimento ethos (at least initially) and a significant increase in theatre censorship.{{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=3}}  This is reflected both in Verdi's choices of plots dealing more with personal relationships than political conflict, and in a (partly consequent) dramatic reduction in the operas of this period in the  number of choruses (of the type which had first made him famous)\u2014not only are there on average 40% fewer choruses in the 'middle' period operas compared to the 'early' period', but whereas virtually all the 'early' operas commence with a chorus, only one (''Luisa Miller'') of the 'middle' period operas begin this way. Instead, Verdi experiments with a variety of means, e.g. a stage band (''Rigoletto''), an aria for [[bass (voice type)|bass]] (''Stiffelio''), a party scene (''La traviata''). Chusid also notes Verdi's increasing tendency to replace full-scale overtures with shorter orchestral introductions.{{sfn|Chusid|1997|pp=9\u201311}} Parker comments that ''La traviata'', the last opera of the 'middle' period,  is \"again a new adventure. It gestures towards a level of '[[Realism (arts)|realism]]'...the contemporary world of [[waltz]]es pervades the score, and the heroine's death from disease is graphically depicted in the  music.\"{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a74 (vi)}} Verdi's increasing command of musical highlighting of changing moods and relationships is exemplified in Act III of ''Rigoletto'', where Duke's flippant song \"La donna \u00e8 mobile\" is followed immediately by the quartet \"Bella figlia dell'amore\", contrasting the rapacious Duke and his inamorata with the (concealed) indignant Rigoletto and his grieving daughter. Taruskin asserts this is \"the most famous ensemble Verdi ever composed.\"{{sfn|Taruskin|2010|p=587}}\n\n====Late period====\n[[File:Vesper2.jpg|upright|thumb|right|''Les v\u00eapres siciliennes'': poster for the premiere (1855)]] Chusid notes Strepponi's description of the operas of the 1860s and 1870s as being \"modern\" whereas Verdi described the pre-1849 works as \"the [[cavatina]] operas\", as further indication that \"Verdi became increasingly dissatisfied with the older, familiar conventions of his predecessors that he had adopted at the outset of his career,\"{{sfn|Chusid|1997|p=2}} Parker sees a physical differentiation of the operas from ''Les v\u00eapres siciliennes'' (1855) to ''Aida'' (1871) is that they are significantly longer, and with larger cast-lists, than previous works. They also reflect a shift towards the French genre of grand opera, notable in more colorful orchestration, counterpointing of serious and comic scenes, and greater spectacle.{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a76 (i)}} The opportunities of transforming Italian opera by utilising such resources appealed to him. For a commission from the Paris Op\u00e9ra he expressly demanded a libretto from [[Eug\u00e8ne Scribe]], the favorite librettist of Meyerbeer, telling him: \"I want\u2014in fact, I must have\u2014a grandiose, impassioned and original subject.\" The result was ''Les v\u00eapres siciliennes'', and the scenarios of ''Simon Boccanegra'' (1857), ''Un ballo in maschera'' (1859), ''La forza del destino'' (1862), ''Don Carlos'' (1865) and ''Aida'' (1872) all meet the same criteria. Porter notes that ''Un ballo'' marks an almost complete synthesis of Verdi's style with the grand opera hallmarks, such that \"huge spectacle is not mere decoration but essential to the drama...musical and theatrical lines remain taut [and] the characters still sing as warmly, passionately and personally as in ''Il trovatore''.\"{{sfn|Porter|1980|pp=653\u201355}}\n\nWhen the composer [[Ferdinand Hiller]] asked Verdi whether he preferred ''Aida'' or ''Don Carlos'', Verdi replied that ''Aida'' had \"more bite and (if you'll forgive the word), more ''theatricality''.\"{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=272}} During the rehearsals for the Naples production of ''Aida'' Verdi amused himself by writing his only string quartet, a sprightly work which shows in its last movement that he had not lost the skill for fugue-writing that he had learned with Lavigna.{{sfn|Budden|1993|pp=310\u201311}}\n\n====Final works====\n[[File:Maurel-iago.jpg|thumb|left|alt=man in 16th century costume sitting in chair|upright|[[Victor Maurel]] in costume as Iago, the role he created in ''Otello'']]Verdi's three last major works continued to show new development in conveying drama and emotion. The first to appear, in 1874 was his Requiem, scored for operatic forces but by no means an \"opera in ecclesiastical dress\" (the words in which [[Hans von B\u00fclow]] condemned it before even hearing it).{{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a77}} Although in the Requiem Verdi puts to use many of the techniques he learned in opera, its musical forms and emotions are not those of the stage.{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|pp=161\u201362}} Verdi's tone painting at the opening of the Requiem is vividly described by the Italian composer [[Ildebrando Pizzetti]],  writing in 1941: \"in [the words] murmured by an invisible crowd over the slow swaying of a few simple chords, you straightaway sense the fear and sadness of a vast multitude before the mystery of death. In the [following] ''Et lux perpetuum'' the melody spreads it wings...before falling back on itself...you hear a sigh for consolation and eternal peace.\"{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=320}}\n\nBy the time ''Otello'' premi\u00e8red in 1887, more than 15 years after ''Aida'', the operas of Verdi's (predeceased) contemporary Richard Wagner had begun their ascendancy in popular taste, and many sought or identified Wagnerian aspects in Verdi's latest composition.{{sfn|Taruskin|2010|pp=602\u201303}} Budden points out that there is little in the music of ''Otello'' that relates either to the ''[[verismo]]'' opera of the younger Italian composers, and little if anything which can be construed as a homage to the [[New German School]].{{sfn|Budden|1993|p=281}} Nonetheless there is still much originality, building on the strengths which Verdi had already demonstrated; the powerful storm which opens the opera ''[[in medias res]]'', the recollection of the love duet of Act I in Otello's dying words (more an aspect of ''tinta'' than ''[[leitmotif]]''), imaginative touches of harmony in Iago's \"Era la notte\" (Act II).{{sfn|Budden|1993|pp=282\u201384}}\n\nFinally, six years later, appeared ''Falstaff'', Verdi's only comedy apart from the early, ill-fated ''Un giorno di regno''. In this work Roger Parker writes that:\n:\"the listener is bombarded by a stunning diversity of rhythms, orchestral textures, melodic motifs and harmonic devices. Passages that in earlier times would have furnished material for an entire number here crowd in on each other, shouldering themselves unceremoniously to the fore in bewildering succession\".{{sfn|Parker|1998|p=229}} Rosselli comments: \"In ''Otello'' Verdi had miniaturized the forms of romantic Italian opera; in ''Falstaff'' he miniaturized himself...[M]oments...crystallize a feeling...as though an aria or duet had been precipitated into a phrase.\"{{sfn|Rosselli|2000|p=182}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Verdi statue.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Luigi Secchi's 1913 statue of Verdi in Busseto]]\n\n===Reception===\nAlthough Verdi's operas brought him a popular following, not all contemporary critics approved of his work. The English critic [[Henry Chorley]] allowed in 1846 that \"he is the only modern man...having a style\u2014for better or worse\", but found  all his output unacceptable. \"[His] faults [are] grave ones, calculated to destroy and degrade taste beyond those of any Italian composer in the long list\" wrote Chorley, whilst conceding that \"howsoever incomplete may have been his training, howsoever mistaken his aspirations may have proved...he ''has'' aspired.\"{{sfn|Chorley|1972|pp=182, 185\u20136}} But by the time of Verdi's death, 55 years later, his reputation was assured, and the 1910 edition of [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians#Grove.27s Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove's Dictionary]]  pronounced him \"one of the greatest and most popular opera composers of the nineteenth century.\"{{sfn|Mazzucato|1910|p=247}}\n\nVerdi had no pupils apart from Muzio and no school of composers sought to follow his style which, however much it reflected his own musical direction, was rooted in the period of his own youth. By the time of his death, ''[[Verismo (music)|verismo]]'' was the accepted style of young Italian composers. {{sfn|Parker|n.d.|loc=\u00a710 (ii)}} The [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] frequently staged ''Rigoletto, Trovatore'' and ''Traviata'' during this period and featured ''Aida'' in every season from 1898 to 1945. Interest in the operas reawakened in mid-1920s Germany and this sparked a revival in England and elsewhere. From the 1930s onward there began to appear scholarly biographies and publications of documentation and correspondence.{{sfn|Harwood|2004|p=272}}\n\nIn 1959 the Instituto di Studi Verdiani (from 1989 the Istituto Nazionale di Studi Verdiani) was founded in Parma and became a leading centre for research and publication of Verdi studies,<ref>[http://www.studiverdiani.it/presentazione_en.html \"Who we are\"] website of the Istituto di studi verdiani, accessed 27 June 2015.</ref> and in the 1970s the American Institute for Verdi Studies was founded at [[New York University]].<ref>[http://www.nyu.edu/projects/verdi/ \"American Institute for Verdi Studies\"] at NYU website, accessed 27 June 2015.</ref>{{sfn|Harwood|2004|p=273}}\n\n===Memorials and film and stage portrayals===\n[[File:Final scene from the opera Risorgimento!.jpg|thumb|The final scene of the opera ''Risorgimento!''

In particular, the ''[[Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves]]'' (known as ''Va, pensiero'') from the third act of the opera ''[[Nabucco]]'' was intended to be an anthem for Italian patriots, who were seeking to unify their country and free it from foreign control in the years up to 1861 (the chorus's theme of exiles singing about their homeland, and its lines such as ''O mia patria, si bella e perduta'' / \"O my country, so lovely and so lost\" were thought to have resonated with many Italians).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/NATMUSIC.html |title=Modern History Sourcebook: Music and Nationalism |publisher=Fordham.edu |accessdate=31 May 2015}}</ref> Beginning in Naples in 1859 and spreading throughout Italy, the slogan \"Viva VERDI\" was used as an acronym for '''''Viva''' '''V'''ittorio '''E'''manuele '''R'''e '''D'''<nowiki>'</nowiki>'''I'''talia'' (''Long live Victor Emmanuel King of Italy''), referring to [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].<ref>Parker 1998, p. 942</ref><ref>Budden 1973, Vol. 3, p. 80</ref>\n\nGeorge Martin says Verdi was \"the greatest artist\" of the [[Risorgimento]]. \"Throughout his work its values, its issues recur constantly, and he expressed them with great power\".<ref>{{cite book|author=George Whitney Martin|title=Aspects of Verdi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5nN5c9144XwC&pg=PA3|year=1988|publisher=Limelight Editions|pages=3\u20134}}</ref>  Franco DellaPeruta agrees that the operas and the Risorgimento are linked, emphasizing Verdi's patriotic intent and links to the values of the Risorgimento.{{Elaboration needed|reason=What are these values in particular?|date=December 2016}} Verdi started as a republican, became a strong supporter of [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Cavour]], and entered the Italian parliament on Cavour's suggestion. His politics caused him to be frequently in trouble with the Austrian censors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} Verdi's main works of 1842\u201349 were especially relevant to the struggle for independence, including 'Nabucco' (1842), 'I Lombardi alla Prima Crociata' (1843), 'Ernani' (1844), 'Attila' (1846), 'Macbeth' (1847), and 'La Battaglia di Legnano' (1848). However, starting in the 1850s, his operas showed few patriotic themes because of the heavy censorship by the absolutist regime in power. Verdi later became disillusioned by politics, but he was personally active part in the political world of events of the Risorgimento and was elected to the first Italian parliament in 1861.<ref>Franco DellaPeruta, \"Verdi e il Risorgimento,\" ''Rassegna Storica del Risorgimento'' (2001) 88#1 pp. 3\u201324</ref> Likewise, Marco Pizzo argues that after 1815, music became a political tool, and many songwriters expressed ideals of freedom and equality. Pizzo claims that Verdi was part of this movement, for his operas were inspired by the love of country, the struggle for Italian independence, and speak to the sacrifice of patriots and exiles.<ref>Marco Pizzo, \"Verdi, Musica e Risorgimento,\" ''Rassegna Storica del Risorgimento'' (2001) 87 supplement 4 pp. 37\u201344</ref>\n\nOn the other side of the debate, Mary Ann Smart argues that music critics at the time seldom mentioned any political themes.<ref>Mary Ann Smart, \"Verdi, Italian Romanticism, and the Risorgimento,\" in {{cite book|author=Scott L.

The German Navy was originally known as the ''Bundesmarine'' (\"Federal Navy\") from 1956 until 1995 when ''Deutsche Marine'' (\"German Navy\") became the official name with respect to the 1990 incorporation of the East German ''[[Volksmarine]]'' (\"People's Navy\"). It is deeply integrated into the [[NATO]] alliance. Its primary mission is protection of Germany's territorial waters and maritime infrastructure as well as [[sea lines of communication]]. Apart from this, the German Navy participates in peacekeeping operations, and renders humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. They also participate in Anti-Piracy operations.<ref>http://www.marine.de/portal/a/marine/start/aktuelle/einsatze/atalanta/!ut/p/z1/hY7BDoIwEES_xQPXboWA6K0mGDFETdQIvZgCtWAqJaWCn28NJxONc9vZN5MBCinQhvW1YKZWDZP2zmhwWYbJMXHnrpusMMFxFG3Xvh9Pd1EA538AtW_8QwTDoeSQ2Y7Zz46ThYACvbGePVGrtJHcIFa8F0JWsaaUfK8KMhoboEKqfJxOmtwLBVDNr1xzjR7a2pUxbbdwsIOHYUBCKSE5KrmDvyUq1RlIP0Bo7-mAPV_2CZm8AFHr5G4!/dz/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/#Z7_B8LTL2922LF0A0IEENH55I1OU0</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Naval history of World War II}}\n\nThe German Navy traces its roots back to the ''[[Reichsflotte]]'' (Imperial Fleet) of the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionary era of 1848\u201352]]. The Reichsflotte was the first German navy to sail under the [[Flag of Germany|black-red-gold]] flag. Founded on 14 June 1848 by the orders of the democratically elected [[Frankfurt Parliament]], the Reichsflotte's brief existence ended with the failure of the revolution and it was disbanded on 2 April 1852; thus, the modern day navy celebrates its birthday on 14 June.\n\nBetween May 1945 and 1956, the [[German Mine Sweeping Administration]] and its successor organizations, made up of former members of Nazi Germany's  ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' (\"War Navy\"), became something of a transition stage for the navy, allowing the future ''Marine'' to draw on recently experienced personnel upon its formation. Also, from 1949-52 the US Navy had maintained the [[Naval Historical Team]] in Bremerhaven. This group of former Kriegsmarine officers acting as historical and tactical consultants to the Americans, was significant in establishing a German element in the NATO senior naval staff. In 1956, with [[West Germany]]'s accession to NATO, the ''Bundesmarine'' (\"Federal Navy\"), as the navy was known colloquially, was formally established. In the same year the East German ''Volkspolizei See'' (literally \"People's Police Sea\") became the ''Volksmarine'' (\"People's Navy\"). During the Cold War all of the German Navy's combat vessels were assigned to [[NATO]]'s [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches]]'s naval command [[Allied Forces Baltic Approaches#Commander.2C Allied Naval Forces Baltic Approaches|NAVBALTAP]].\n\nWith the accession of [[East Germany]] to the Federal Republic of Germany in 1990 the Volksmarine along with the whole [[National People's Army]] (''Nationale Volksarmee'', NVA) became part of the Bundeswehr. Since 1995 the name ''German Navy'' is used in international context, while the official name since 1956 remains ''Marine'' without any additions. As of 16 December 2016, the strength of the navy is 16,137 men and women.<ref name=\"bundeswehr\"/>\n\nA number of naval forces have operated in different periods. See\n* [[Preu\u00dfische Marine]] (Prussian Navy), 1701\u20131867\n* [[Reichsflotte]] (Fleet of the Realm), 1848\u201352\n* [[North German Federal Navy]], 1867\u201371\n* [[Imperial German Navy]] (''Kaiserliche Marine''), 1871\u20131919\n* [[Reichsmarine]], 1919\u201335\n* [[Kriegsmarine]], 1935\u201345\n* [[German Mine Sweeping Administration]], 1945\u201348\n* [[Volksmarine]] the navy of [[East Germany]] (GDR) 1956\u201390\n* ''Marine'', 1956\u2013present (''Bundesmarine'', colloquially)\n\n==Current operations==\nGerman warships permanently participate in all four ''NATO Maritime Groups''. The German Navy is also engaged in operations against international [[terrorism]] such as [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and NATO [[Operation Active Endeavour]].\n\nPresently the largest operation the German Navy is participating in is [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UNIFIL]] off the coast of [[Lebanon]]. The German contribution to this operation is two frigates, four [[Fast Attack Craft|fast attack craft]], and two auxiliary vessels. The naval component of UNIFIL has been under German command.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marine.de/portal/a/marine/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKODzIMBMmB2d5mIfqRcNGglFR9X4_83FR9b_0A_YLciHJHR0VFAIngHDk!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjNfUjFR?yw_contentURL%3D%2F01DB070000000001%2FW27G6EFV180INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp|title=Bilanz und Ausblick|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101153744/http://www.marine.de/portal/a/marine/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLNzKODzIMBMmB2d5mIfqRcNGglFR9X4_83FR9b_0A_YLciHJHR0VFAIngHDk!/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfMjNfUjFR?yw_contentURL=%2F01DB070000000001%2FW27G6EFV180INFODE%2Fcontent.jsp|archivedate=1 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe navy is operating a number of development and testing installations as part of an inter-service and international network. Among these is the [[Centre of Excellence for Operations in Confined and Shallow Waters]] (COE CSW), an affiliated centre of [[Allied Command Transformation]]. The COE CSW was established in April 2007 and officially accredited by NATO on 26 May 2009.<ref>Deutsche Marine \u2013 press release: Neues Nato-Expertenzentrum an der Kieler F\u00f6rde nimmt Fahrt auf; Faermann, 2009</ref> It is co-located with the staff of the German Flotilla 1 in [[Kiel]] whose Commander is double-hatted as Director, COE CSW.\n\n==Equipment==\n===Ships and submarines===\n{{see also|List of active German Navy ships}}\n\nIn total, there are about [[List of active German Navy ships|65 commissioned ships]] in the German Navy, including; 10 [[frigates]], 5 [[corvettes]], 3 [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]], 10 [[minehunter]]s, 6 [[submarines]], 11 replenishment ships and 20 miscellaneous [[auxiliary ship|auxiliary vessels]].

It interconnects [[national research and education networks]] (NRENs) across Europe, enabling collaboration on projects ranging from biological science, to earth observation, to arts and culture. The G\u00c9ANT project combines a high-bandwidth, high-capacity 50,000&nbsp;km network with a growing range of services.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geant.net/services/ |title=users |publisher=Geant.net |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> These allow researchers to collaborate, working together wherever they are located.

Through links to research networks in other regions (such as [[Internet2]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internet2.edu/ |title=internet2.edu |publisher=internet2.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> and [[ESnet]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.es.net/ |title=es.net |publisher=es.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> in the USA, [[AfricaConnect]]<ref>http://www.africaconnect.eu/pages/home.aspx</ref> in Africa, [[TEIN]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teincc.org/teincc/index.do |title=Tein*Cc |language=ko |publisher=Teincc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> in Asia-Pacific and [[RedCLARA]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redclara.net |title=redclara.net |publisher=redclara.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> in Latin America), G\u00c9ANT enables collaboration between researchers in over half the world\u2019s countries.\n\nCo-funded by the [[European Commission]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu |title=ec.europa.eu |publisher=ec.europa.eu |date=2011-12-21 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> and Europe\u2019s NRENs, the G\u00c9ANT network was built and is operated by the G\u00c9ANT Association. The G\u00c9ANT project is a collaboration between 41 partners: 38 European [[NREN]]s, and [[NORDUnet]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nordu.net |title=NORDUnet |publisher=Nordu.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref> (representing the five Nordic countries).\n\n==History==\nThe G\u00c9ANT project began in November 2000, entered full production operation in December 2001 (fully replacing a network called TEN-155). Originally due to finish in October 2004, it was subsequently extended until April 2005. \n\nThe second generation network, named G\u00c9ANT2, began in September 2004 and continued through 2009, growing the network to 30 national networks in 34 countries. \n\nThe next G\u00c9ANT project (GN3) began on 1 April 2009 and continued until April 2013. This was then superseded by the GN3plus project which was scheduled to run for two years. It is funded under the EC\u2019s seventh research and development [[Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development|Research Framework Programme]] (often referred to as FP7). \n\nThe Project is now in its fourth iteration (GN4).\n\n==Technology==\nAs well as providing the high-bandwidth links across Europe, the G\u00c9ANT network also acts as a [[testbed]] for new technology.\n\nIt was the first \"hybrid\" network deployed on an international scale, combining routed [[Internet Protocol|IP]] and [[switched infrastructure]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} This enables the network to offer general traffic alongside virtual \"private\" network paths for projects, such as the [[Large Hadron Collider]], which have particular requirements involving dedicated bandwidth, security and flexibility.\n\nG\u00c9ANT supported native [[IPv6]] since 2002 and [[multicast]] IPv6 since 2004. It is involved in network research, in areas such as carrier class network technologies, photonic switching, federated network architectures and virtualisation.\n\nIn 2013 a substantial network migration program was completed, meaning users could be offered multiple 100 Gbit/s links, with the core network supporting 500 Gbit/s and a [[network planning and design|network design]] that will support up to 8Tbit/s. \n\nAlready, over 1 [[Petabyte]] of data are transferred every day via the G\u00c9ANT [[backbone network]].\n\n==Participants==\nThe G\u00c9ANT project is a collaboration between 41 partners: 38 European NRENs and NORDUnet (representing the five Nordic countries).\n\nThe full list of NREN project partners are available on the website.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.geant.org/Projects/GEANT_Project_GN4/Pages/Home.aspx |title=G\u00c9ANT Partners |publisher=Geant.org |date=2018-07-02 |accessdate=2017-07-02}}</ref>\n\n==Global links==\nG\u00c9ANT links to research networks in other world regions, including:\n* North America ([[Internet2]], [[ESnet]], [[National LambdaRail|NLR]], [[NISN]] and [[CANARIE]])\n* [[RedCLARA|Latin America]]\n* North Africa and the Middle East<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eumedconnect.net/ |title=eumedconnect.net |publisher=eumedconnect.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref>\n* [[UbuntuNet Alliance for Research and Education Networking|South Africa/Kenya]]\n* The South Caucasus\n* Central Asia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caren.dante.net/ |title=caren.dante.net |publisher=caren.dante.net |date= |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref>\n* Asia Pacific<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tein3.net/ |title=tein3.net |publisher=tein3.net |date=2012-08-26 |accessdate=2014-08-05}}</ref>\n\nThese links not only help international research collaboration but also aid with projects that deliver societal benefit, such as e-health, telemedicine and weather forecasting/disaster warning systems.

Of these analogues, only 4-methyl-GHB (\u03b3-hydroxyvaleric acid, GHV) and a prodrug form [[\u03b3-valerolactone]] (GVL) have been reported as drugs of abuse in humans, and on the available evidence seem to be less potent but more toxic than GHB, with a particular tendency to cause nausea and vomiting.\n\nOther prodrug ester forms of GHB have also rarely been encountered by law enforcement, including [[1,4-diacetoxybutane|1,4-butanediol diacetate]] (BDDA/DABD), [[methyl-4-acetoxybutanoate]] (MAB), and [[ethyl-4-acetoxybutanoate]] (EAB),{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} but these are, in general, covered by analogue laws in jurisdictions where GHB is illegal, and little is known about them beyond their delayed onset and longer duration of action. The intermediate compound [[\u03b3-hydroxybutyraldehyde]] (GHBAL) is also a prodrug for GHB; however, as with all [[aliphatic]] aldehydes this compound is caustic and is strong-smelling and foul-tasting; actual use of this compound as an intoxicant is likely to be unpleasant and result in severe nausea and vomiting.\n\n[[File:GHB metabolic pathway.svg|thumb|center|600px|Metabolic pathway of GHB.<!-- This image incorrectly labels the enzyme responsible for GBL breakdown as lactamase.

Under normal physiological conditions, the concentration of GHB in the body is rather low, and the pathways would run in the reverse direction to what is shown here to produce endogenous GHB. However, when GHB is consumed for [[recreational drug use|recreational]] or health promotion purposes, its concentration in the body is much higher than normal, which changes the enzyme kinetics so that these pathways operate to metabolise GHB rather than producing it.\n\n==History==\n[[Alexander Mikhaylovich Zaytsev|Alexander Zaytsev]] worked on this chemical family and published work on it in 1874.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=David E.|title=Early Russian organic chemists and their legacy|date=2012|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783642282195|chapter=Section 4.4.3 Aleksandr Mikhailovich Zaitsev}}</ref>{{rp|79}}<ref>{{Cite journal| year = 1874 | title = \u00dcber die Reduction des Succinylchlorids | journal = [[Liebigs Annalen der Chemie]] | volume = 171 | pages = 258\u2013290 | language = German | doi = 10.1002/jlac.18741710216| issue = 2| last1 = Saytzeff| first1 = Alexander}}</ref> The first extended research into GHB and its use in humans was conducted in the early 1960s by Dr. [[Henri Laborit]] to use in studying the neurotransmitter GABA.<ref name=\"WHO\">{{cite web|title=Critical review of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/quality_safety/4.1GHBcritical_review.pdf|date=2012}}</ref>{{rp|11\u201312}}<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Laborit H, Jouany JM, Gerard J, Fabiani F | title = [Generalities concerning the experimental study and clinical use of gamma hydroxybutyrate of Na] | language = French | journal = Agressologie | volume = 1 | pages = 397\u2013406 | date = October 1960 | pmid = 13758011 }}</ref>  It was studied in a range of uses including obstetric surgery and during childbirth and as an anxiolytic; there were anecdotal reports of it having antidepressant and aphrodisiac effects as well.<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|27}}  It was also studied as an intraveuous [[anesthetic]] agent and was marketed for that purpose starting in 1964 in Europe but it was not widely adopted as it caused seizures; as of 2006 that use was still authorized in France and Italy but not widely used.<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|27\u201328}}  It was also studied to treat alcohol addiction; while the evidence for this use is weak,<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|28\u201329}} however sodium oxybate is marketed for this use in Italy.<ref name=\"AlcoverLabel\">{{cite web|title=Alcover: Riassunto delle Caratteristiche del Prodotto|url=https://farmaci.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/aifa/servlet/PdfDownloadServlet?pdfFileName=footer_000223_027751_RCP.pdf&retry=0&sys=m0b1l3|date=31 March 2017|publisher=Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco}} [https://farmaci.agenziafarmaco.gov.it/bancadatifarmaci/farmaco?farmaco=027751 Index page]</ref>\n\nGHB and sodium oxybate were also studied for use in [[narcolepsy]] from the 1960s onwards.<ref name=WHO/>{{rp|28}}\n\nIn May 1990 GHB was introduced as a [[dietary supplement]] and was marketed to body builders, for help with weight control and as a sleep aid, and as a \"replacement\" for [[l-tryptophan]], which was removed from the market in November 1989 when batches of it were found to cause [[eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome]].

Historian [[Frances Yates]] argues that Bruno was deeply influenced by [[Arab astrology]] (particularly the philosophy of [[Averroes]]<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Giordano-Bruno|title=Giordano Bruno|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>), [[Neoplatonism]], Renaissance [[Hermeticism]], and Genesis-like legends surrounding the Egyptian god [[Thoth]].<ref>The primary work on the relationship between Bruno and Hermeticism is Frances Yates, ''Giordano Bruno and The Hermetic Tradition'', 1964; for an alternative assessment, placing more emphasis on the Kabbalah, and less on Hermeticism, see Karen Silvia De Leon-Jones, ''Giordano Bruno and the Kabbalah'', Yale, 1997; for a return to emphasis on Bruno's role in the development of Science, and criticism of Yates' emphasis on magical and Hermetic themes, see Hillary Gatti, ''Giordano Bruno and Renaissance Science'', Cornell, 1999</ref> Other studies of Bruno have focused on his qualitative approach to mathematics and his application of the spatial concepts of geometry to language.<ref>Alessandro G.

In his youth he was sent to [[Naples]] to be educated. He was tutored privately at the Augustinian monastery there, and attended public lectures at the [[Studium Generale]].<ref>Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950.</ref> At the age of 17, he entered the [[Dominican Order]] at the monastery of [[San Domenico Maggiore]] in [[Naples]], taking the name Giordano, after Giordano Crispo, his metaphysics tutor. He continued his studies there, completing his [[novitiate]], and became an ordained priest in 1572 at age 24. During his time in Naples he became known for his skill with the art of memory and on one occasion traveled to Rome to demonstrate his mnemonic system before [[Pope Pius V]] and [[Scipione Rebiba|Cardinal Rebiba]]. In his later years Bruno claimed that the Pope accepted his dedication to him of the lost work ''On The Ark of Noah'' at this time.<ref>This is recorded in the diary of one Guillaume Cotin, librarian of the Abbey of St. Victor, who recorded recollections of a number of personal conversations he had with Bruno. Bruno also mentions this dedication in the Dedicatory Epistle of ''The Cabala of Pegasus'' (''Cabala del Cavallo Pegaseo'', 1585).</ref>\n\nWhile Bruno was distinguished for outstanding ability, his taste for free thinking and forbidden books soon caused him difficulties. Given the controversy he caused in later life it is surprising that he was able to remain within the monastic system for eleven years. In his testimony to Venetian inquisitors during his trial, many years later, he says that proceedings were twice taken against him for having cast away images of the saints, retaining only a crucifix, and for having recommended controversial texts to a novice.<ref>Gargano (2007), p. 11</ref> Such behavior could perhaps be overlooked, but Bruno's situation became much more serious when he was reported to have defended the [[Arianism|Arian heresy]], and when a copy of the banned writings of [[Erasmus]], annotated by him, was discovered hidden in the convent privy. When he learned that an indictment was being prepared against him in Naples he fled, shedding his [[religious habit]], at least for a time.<ref>Gosselin has argued that Bruno's report that he returned to Dominican garb in Padua suggests that he kept his tonsure at least until his arrival in Geneva in 1579. He also suggests it is likely that Bruno kept the tonsure even after this point, showing a continued and deep religious attachment contrary to the way in which Bruno has been portrayed as a martyr for modern science. Instead, Gosselin argues, Bruno should be understood in the context of reformist Catholic dissenters. Edward A. Gosselin, \"A Dominican Head in Layman's Garb?

From Venice he went to [[Padua]], where he met fellow Dominicans who convinced him to wear his [[religious habit]] again. From Padua he went to [[Bergamo]] and then across the Alps to [[Chamb\u00e9ry]] and [[Lyon]]. His movements after this time are obscure.<ref>Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950 \"Following the northern route back through Brescia, Bruno came to Bergamo where he resumed the monastic habit. He perhaps visited Milan, and then leaving Italy he crossed the Alps by the Mont Cenis pass, and came to Chamb\u00e9ry. He describes his hospitable reception there by the Dominican Convent, but again he received no encouragement to remain, and he journeyed on to Lyons. Bruno's next movements are obscure. In 1579 he reached Geneva.\"</ref>\n[[File:Earlierbruno.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The earliest depiction of Bruno is an engraving published in 1715 in Germany, presumed based on a lost contemporary portrait.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Virgilio Salvestrini, ''Bibliografia di Giordano Bruno'', Firenze, 1958</ref>]]\nIn 1579 he arrived in [[Geneva]]. As D.W. Singer, a Bruno biographer, notes, \"The question has sometimes been raised as to whether Bruno became a Protestant, but it is intrinsically most unlikely that he accepted membership in Calvin's communion\"<ref>Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950; Singer points out in a footnote that Bruno's name appears in a list, compiled one hundred years later, of Italian refugees who had belonged to the Protestant church of Geneva. However, she does not find this evidence convincing.</ref> During his Venetian trial he told inquisitors that while in Geneva he told the Marchese de Vico of Naples, who was notable for helping Italian refugees in Geneva, \"I did not intend to adopt the religion of the city. I desired to stay there only that I might live at liberty and in security.\" Bruno had a pair of breeches made for himself, and the Marchese and others apparently made Bruno a gift of a sword, hat, cape and other necessities for dressing himself; in such clothing Bruno could no longer be recognized as a priest. Things apparently went well for Bruno for a time, as he entered his name in the Rector's Book of the [[University of Geneva]] in May 1579. But in keeping with his personality he could not long remain silent. In August he published an attack on the work of Antoine de la Faye, a distinguished professor. He and the printer were promptly arrested. Rather than apologizing, Bruno insisted on continuing to defend his publication. He was refused the right to take [[sacrament]]. Though this right was eventually restored, he left Geneva.\n\nHe went to France, arriving first in [[Lyon]], and thereafter settling for a time (1580\u20131581) in [[Toulouse]], where he took his doctorate in theology and was elected by students to lecture in philosophy. It seems he also attempted at this time to return to Catholicism, but was denied absolution by the Jesuit priest he approached. When religious strife broke out in the summer of 1581, he moved to Paris. There he held a cycle of thirty lectures on theological topics and also began to gain fame for his prodigious memory. Bruno's feats of memory were based, at least in part, on his elaborate system of mnemonics, but some of his contemporaries found it easier to attribute them to magical powers. His talents attracted the benevolent attention of the king [[Henry III of France|Henry III]]. The king summoned him to the court. Bruno subsequently reported <blockquote>\"I got me such a name that King Henry III summoned me one day to discover from me if the memory which I possessed was natural or acquired by magic art. I satisfied him that it did not come from sorcery but from organised knowledge; and, following this, I got a book on memory printed, entitled ''The Shadows of Ideas'', which I dedicated to His Majesty. Forthwith he gave me an Extraordinary Lectureship with a salary.\"<ref>William Boulting, ''Giordano Bruno: His Life, Thought, and Martyrdom'', 1916, p. 58</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn Paris Bruno enjoyed the protection of his powerful French patrons. During this period, he published several works on mnemonics, including ''[[De umbris idearum]]'' (''On the Shadows of Ideas'', 1582), ''[[Ars Memoriae (book by Giordano Bruno)|Ars Memoriae]]'' (''The Art of Memory'', 1582), and ''[[Circe in the arts#Reasoning beasts|Cantus Circaeus]]'' (''Circe's Song'', 1582). All of these were based on his mnemonic models of organised knowledge and experience, as opposed to the simplistic logic-based mnemonic techniques of [[Petrus Ramus]] then becoming popular. Bruno also published a comedy summarizing some of his philosophical positions, titled ''Il Candelaio'' (''The Torchbearer'', 1582). In the 16th century dedications were, as a rule, approved beforehand, and hence were a way of placing a work under the protection of an individual. Given that Bruno dedicated various works to the likes of King Henry III, Sir [[Philip Sidney]], [[Michel de Castelnau]] (French Ambassador to England), and possibly [[Pope Pius V]], it is apparent that this wanderer had risen sharply in status and moved in powerful circles.\n\n===England, 1583\u20131585===\n[[File:GiordanoBrunomnemonic.gif|thumb|Woodcut illustration of one of Giordano Bruno's less complex mnemonic devices]]\nIn April 1583, Bruno went to England with letters of recommendation from [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] as a guest of the French ambassador, [[Michel de Castelnau]]. There he became acquainted with the poet [[Philip Sidney]] (to whom he dedicated two books) and other members of the Hermetic circle around [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]], though there is no evidence that Bruno ever met Dee himself. He also lectured at [[Oxford University|Oxford]], and unsuccessfully sought a teaching position there. His views were controversial, notably with [[John Underhill, Bishop of Oxford|John Underhill]], Rector of [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and subsequently bishop of Oxford, and [[George Abbot (Archbishop of Canterbury)|George Abbot]], who later became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Abbot mocked Bruno for supporting \"the opinion of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] that the Earth did go round, and the heavens did stand still; whereas in truth it was his own head which rather did run round, and his brains did not stand still\",<ref>{{cite journal |first=Andrew D. |last=Weiner |title=Expelling the Beast: Bruno's Adventures in England |journal=Modern Philology |volume=78 |issue=1 |year=1980 |pages=1\u201313 |jstor=437245 |doi=10.1086/391002}}</ref> and reports accusations that Bruno plagiarized [[Marsilio Ficino|Ficino]]'s work.\n\nNevertheless, his stay in England was fruitful. During that time Bruno completed and published some of his most important works, the six \"Italian Dialogues,\" including the [[cosmological tract]]s ''La Cena de le Ceneri'' (''The Ash Wednesday Supper'', 1584), ''De la Causa, Principio et Uno'' (''On Cause, Principle and Unity'', 1584), ''De l'Infinito, Universo e Mondi'' (''On the Infinite, Universe and Worlds'', 1584) as well as ''Lo Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante'' (''The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast'', 1584) and ''De gl' Heroici Furori'' (''On the Heroic Frenzies'', 1585). Some of these were printed by [[John Charlewood]]. Some of the works that Bruno published in London, notably ''The Ash Wednesday Supper'', appear to have given offense. Once again, Bruno's controversial views and tactless language lost him the support of his friends. John Bossy has advanced the theory that, while staying in the French Embassy in London, Bruno was also spying on Catholic conspirators, under the pseudonym \"Henry Fagot', for [[Sir Francis Walsingham]], [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]'s Secretary of State.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bossy |first=John |title=Giordano Bruno and the Embassy Affair |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |date=1991 |isbn=0-300-04993-5 }}</ref>\n\nBruno is sometimes cited as being the first to propose that the universe is infinite, which he did during his time in England, but an English scientist, [[Thomas Digges]], put forth this idea in a published work in 1576, some eight years earlier than Bruno.<ref>John Gribbin (2009), ''In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality'', {{ISBN|9780470613528}}. p. 88</ref>\n\n===Last years of wandering, 1585\u20131592===\nIn October 1585, after the French embassy in London was attacked by a mob, Bruno returned to Paris with Castelnau, finding a tense political situation. Moreover, his 120 theses against [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] natural science and his pamphlets against the mathematician [[Fabrizio Mordente]] soon put him in ill favor. In 1586, following a violent quarrel about Mordente's invention, the differential compass, he left France for (Germany).\n\n[[File:unamed Figures.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut from \"Articuli centum et sexaginta adversus huius tempestatis mathematicos atque philosophos,\" [[Prague]] 1588]]In Germany he failed to obtain a teaching position at [[Marburg]], but was granted permission to teach at [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Wittenberg]], where he lectured on [[Aristotle]] for two years. However, with a change of intellectual climate there, he was no longer welcome, and went in 1588 to [[Prague]], where he obtained 300 [[Thaler|taler]] from [[Rudolf II]], but no teaching position. He went on to serve briefly as a professor in [[University of Helmstedt|Helmstedt]], but had to flee again when he was [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[Martin Luther|Luther]]ans.\n\nDuring this period he produced several [[Latin]] works, dictated to his friend and secretary Girolamo Besler, including ''De Magia'' (''On Magic''), ''Theses De Magia'' (''Theses on Magic'') and ''De Vinculis in Genere'' (''A General Account of Bonding''). All these were apparently transcribed or recorded by Besler (or Bisler) between 1589 and 1590.<ref>Giordano Bruno, ''Cause Principle and Unity, and Essays on Magic'', Edited by Richard J.

At the time the [[Inquisition]] seemed to be losing some of its strictness, and because Venice was the most liberal state in Italy, Bruno was lulled into making the fatal mistake of returning to Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/82258/Giordano-Bruno/883/Final-years|title=Giordano Bruno|work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|accessdate=8 May 2014|quote=At the time such a move did not seem to be too much of a risk: Venice was by far the most liberal of the Italian states; the European tension had been temporarily eased after the death of the intransigent pope Sixtus V in 1590; the Protestant Henry of Bourbon was now on the throne of France, and a religious pacification seemed to be imminent.}}</ref>\n\nHe went first to [[Padua]], where he taught briefly, and applied unsuccessfully for the chair of mathematics, which was given instead to [[Galileo Galilei]] one year later. Bruno accepted Mocenigo's invitation and moved to Venice in March 1592. For about two months he served as an in-house tutor to Mocenigo. When Bruno announced his plan to leave Venice to his host, the latter, who was unhappy with the teachings he had received and had apparently come to dislike Bruno, denounced him to the Venetian Inquisition, which had Bruno arrested on 22 May 1592. Among the numerous charges of [[blasphemy]] and [[heresy]] brought against him in Venice, based on Mocenigo's denunciation, was his belief in the [[cosmic pluralism|plurality of worlds]], as well as accusations of personal misconduct. Bruno defended himself skillfully, stressing the philosophical character of some of his positions, denying others and admitting that he had had doubts on some matters of dogma. The Roman Inquisition, however, asked for his transfer to Rome. After several months of argument, the Venetian authorities reluctantly consented and Bruno was sent to Rome in February 1593.\n\n===Imprisonment, trial and execution, 1593\u20131600===\nDuring the seven years of his trial in Rome, Bruno was held in confinement, lastly in the [[Tower of Nona]].

In particular, he held firm to his belief in the plurality of worlds, although he was admonished to abandon it. His trial was overseen by the Inquisitor Cardinal [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], who demanded a full recantation, which Bruno eventually refused. On 20 January 1600, [[Pope Clement VIII]] declared Bruno a heretic and the Inquisition issued a sentence of death. According to the correspondence of [[Caspar Schoppe|Gaspar Schopp]] of [[Breslau]], he is said to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have replied: ''Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiam'' (\"Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it\").<ref>This is discussed in Dorothea Waley Singer, ''Giordano Bruno, His Life and Thought'', New York, 1950, ch. 7, \"A gloating account of the whole ritual is given in a letter written on the very day by a youth named Gaspar Schopp of Breslau, a recent convert to Catholicism to whom Pope Clement VIII had shown great favour, creating him Knight of St. Peter and Count of the Sacred Palace. Schopp was addressing Conrad Rittershausen. He recounts that because of his heresy Bruno had been publicly burned that day in the Square of Flowers in front of the Theatre of Pompey. He makes merry over the belief of the Italians that every heretic is a Lutheran. It is evident that he had been present at the interrogations, for he relates in detail the life of Bruno and the works and doctrines for which he had been arraigned, and he gives a vivid account of Bruno's final appearance before his judges on 8th February. To Schopp we owe the knowledge of Bruno's bearing under judgement. When the verdict had been declared, records Schopp, Bruno with a threatening gesture addressed his judges: \"Perchance you who pronounce my sentence are in greater fear than I who receive it.\" Thus he was dismissed to the prison, gloats the convert, \"and was given eight days to recant, but in vain. So today he was led to the funeral pyre. When the image of our Saviour was shown to him before his death he angrily rejected it with averted face. Thus my dear Rittershausen is it our custom to proceed against such men or rather indeed such monsters.\"</ref>\n\nHe was turned over to the secular authorities.

In order these are ''Heresy'', ''Prophecy'', ''Sacrilege'', ''Treachery'' and ''Conspiracy''.\n\n[[Bertold Brecht]] wrote one of his \"Calendar Stories\" (Kalendergeschichten) on Bruno Giordano.

The story covers his education as a Dominican and his investigation for heresy, and presents multiple versions of his execution on the Campo de' Fiori.\n\nBruno plays a small but significant role in Martin Seay's 2016 novel ''The Mirror Thief''.\n\nBruno is referenced in [[Natasha Mostert]]'s \"Season of the Witch.\"\n\nHis name appears and he is recognized in several novels, including\n*''[[Children of God (novel)|Children of God]]'' by [[Mary Doria Russell]].\n*''[[The Accidental Time Machine]]'' by [[Joe Haldeman]].\n*''[[Tolosa Gold]]'' by [[Justin Hulford]]\n*''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'' by [[Oscar Wilde]]\n*''White Fire'' by [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]].<ref>p. 542 of White Fire by Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.</ref>\n*''[[A Discovery of Witches (book series)|A Discovery of Witches]] by [[Deborah Harkness]]\n*<!-- Man in the Dark by Paul Auster -->\nHe is cited and quoted in [[Pauline Hunter Blair]]'s last adult novel, ''Jacob's Ladder'' (Church Farmhouse Books, Bottisham, 2003).\n\n==Giordano Bruno Foundation==\n{{Main|Giordano Bruno Foundation}}\n\nThe Giordano Bruno Foundation (German: Giordano-Bruno-Stiftung) is a non-profit foundation based in Germany that pursues the \"Support of Evolutionary Humanism\".

They were about 13 years old when they were initially imprisoned at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], close to the same age as [[Anne Frank]] at that time.<ref name=rs /> \"It was kind of surreal pre-teen shit,\" says Lee, describing how his father bribed guards to bring his mother shoes. After a period, his mother was transferred to Bergen-Belsen and his father to Dachau. When the war ended four years later and the Allies liberated the camps, his father set out in search of his mother and found her at a [[displaced persons camp]]. They married there and eventually emigrated to Canada.<ref name=rs>Hiatt, Brian. \"From Rush With Love\", ''Rolling Stone'', July 2, 2015 p. 45</ref>\n\nIn Canada, Lee's parents gave him a Jewish education, with a [[bar mitzvah]] at age 13. His father was a skilled musician, but died the year before from medical problems resulting from his imprisonment.<ref name=rs /> This forced his mother to find outside work to support three children.<ref name=rs /> Lee feels that not having parents at home during those years was probably a factor in his becoming a musician: \"It was a terrible blow that I lost him, but the course of my life changed because my mother couldn't control us.\" He said that losing his father at such an early age made him aware of how \"quickly life can disappear\", which inspired him from then on to get the most out of his life and music.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVR6ZvWkL5Q;t=47s ''The Story of Geddy Lee''], Banger Films, Canada (2015)</ref>\n\nHe turned his basement into  practice space for a band he formed with high-school friends. After the band began earning income from small performances at high-school shows or other events, he decided to drop out of high school and play rock and roll professionally. His mother was devastated when he told her, and he still feels that he owes her for the disappointments in her life. \"All the shit I put her through,\" he says, \"on top of the fact that she just lost her husband. I felt like I had to make sure that it was worth it. I wanted to show her that I was a professional, that I was working hard, and wasn't just a fuckin' lunatic.\"<ref name=rs />\n\nToday, Lee considers himself a cultural Jew. ''[[j.|Jweekly]]'' featured Lee's reflections on his mother's experiences as a refugee, and of his own Jewish heritage.<ref name=jweeklysf /> Lee's name, ''Geddy'', was derived from his mother's heavily accented pronunciation of his given first name, ''Gary''. This was picked up by his friends in school, leading Lee to adopt it as his stage name and later his legal name.<ref name=Buttner>{{cite web|last=Buttner|first=Christopher|title=Geddy Lee: The Reluctant Rockstar|url=http://www.prthatrocks.com/interviews/geddy.html|publisher=''Bass Frontiers Magazine''|date=November 1996|accessdate=26 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter Rush had become a widely recognized rock group, Lee told the story about his mother's early life to the group's drummer and lyricist, [[Neil Peart]], who then wrote the lyrics to \"[[Red Sector A]]\", inspired by her ordeal. The song, for which Lee wrote the music, was released on the band's 1984 album [[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|''Grace Under Pressure'']].<ref name=\"jweeklysf\" /> The lyrics include the following verse:\n\n{{poemquote|\nI hear the sound of gunfire at the prison gate\nAre the liberators here?\nDo I hope or do I fear?\nFor my father and my brother, it's too late\nBut I must help my mother stand up straight<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3ytkyn3vUU \"Red Sector A\"], video clip</ref>}}\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Early years===\nLee began playing music in school when he was 10 or 11, and got his first acoustic guitar at 14. In school, he first played drums, trumpet and clarinet. However, learning to play instruments in school wasn't satisfying to Lee, and he took basic piano lessons on his own. His interest increased dramatically after listening to some of the popular rock groups at the time. His early influences included [[Jack Bruce]] of [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[John Entwistle]] of [[The Who]], [[Jeff Beck]], and [[Procol Harum]].<ref name=Prato>Prato, Greg.

By 1971, they were now playing mostly original songs in small clubs and bars, including Toronto's Gasworks and Abbey Road Pub.<ref name=Bowman>Bowman, Durrell. ''Experiencing Rush: A Listener's Companion'', Rowman & Littlefield (2015) pp. 3-7</ref> Lee describes the group during these early years as being \"weekend warriors\", holding down jobs during the weekdays and playing music on weekends: \"We longed to break out of the boring surrounding of the suburbs and the endless similarities . . . the shopping plazas and all that stuff. . . the music was a vehicle for us to speak out.\"<ref name=Bowman /> He claims that in the beginning they were simply \"a straightforward rock band.\"<ref name=Bowman />\n\nShort of money, they began opening concerts at venues such as Toronto's Victory Burlesque Theatre for the punk band, [[New York Dolls]].<ref name=Bowman /> By 1972 Rush began performing full-length concerts, consisting mostly of original songs, in cities including Toronto and Detroit. As they gained more recognition, they began performing as an opening act for groups such as [[Aerosmith]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]].<ref name=Armbruster>Armbruster, Greg. ''Keyboard Magazine'', Sept. 1984</ref>\n\n===Style===\nLike Cream, Rush followed the model of a \"power trio\", with Lee both playing bass and singing. Lee's vocals produced a distinctive, \"countertenor\" falsetto, and resonant sound.<ref name=Bowman />  Lee possessed a three-octave vocal range, from baritone through tenor, alto, and mezzo-soprano pitch ranges, although it has significantly decreased with age.<ref name=Bowman /> Lee's playing style is widely regarded for his use of high treble and very hard playing of the strings, and for utilizing the bass as a lead instrument, often contrapuntal to Lifeson's guitar. In the 1970s and early 1980s, Lee mostly used a [[Rickenbacker 4001]] bass, with a very noticeable grit in his tone. During the band's \"synth era\" in the mid-1980s, Lee used [[Steinberger]] and later [[Wal (bass)|Wal]] basses, with the latter having more of a \"jazzy\" tone, according to Lee.<ref>{{Citation|last=mick curry|title=Geddy Lee Interview part 1 of 2|date=2010-04-19|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wma2NtQ1CIE|accessdate=2016-06-18}}</ref> From 1993's ''[[Counterparts (album)|Counterparts]]'' onward, Lee began using the [[Fender Jazz Bass]] almost exclusively, returning to his trademark high treble sound. Lee had first used the Jazz Bass during the recording of '' [[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'', on songs such as \"[[Tom Sawyer (song)|Tom Sawyer]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04Ekje672mo|title=Rush's Geddy Lee on his Fender USA Geddy Lee Jazz Bass|date=April 30, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Rising popularity===\nAfter a number of early albums and increasing popularity, Rush's status as a rock group soared over the following five years as they consistently toured worldwide and produced successful albums, including ''[[2112 (album)|2112]]'' (1976), ''[[A Farewell to Kings]]'' (1977), ''[[Hemispheres (Rush album)|Hemispheres]]'' (1978), ''[[Permanent Waves]]'' (1980), and ''[[Moving Pictures (Rush album)|Moving Pictures]]'' (1981). The group's distinctiveness was enhanced when Lee began adding synthesizers in 1977, with the release of ''A Farewell to Kings''. The additional sounds expanded the group's \"textual capabilities\", states keyboard critic Greg Armbruster, and allowed the trio to produce an orchestrated and more complex [[progressive rock]] music style.<ref name=Armbruster /> It also gave Lee the ability to play bass at the same time, as he could control the synthesizer with foot pedals. In 1981, he won  ''Keyboard'' magazine's poll as \"Best New Talent.\"<ref name=Armbruster /> By the 1984 album ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'', Lee was surrounding himself with stacks of keyboards on stage.<ref name=Armbruster />\n\nBy the 1980s, Rush had become one of the \"biggest rock bands on the planet\", selling out arena seats when touring.<ref name=Prato /><ref name=Buttner /> Lee was considered the most prominent member of the group, being the lead vocalist and known for his dynamic stage movements. According to music critic Tom Mulhern, writing in 1980, \"it's dazzling to see so much sheer energy expended without a nervous breakdown.\"<ref name=Mulhern>Tom Mulhern, ''Bass Heroes: Styles, Stories and Secrets of 30 Great Bass Players'', Backbear Books (1993) p. 110</ref> By 1996, with their [[Test for Echo Tour]], they began performing without an opening act, their shows lasting nearly three hours.<ref name=rollingstone>''Rolling Stone'', Dec. 12, 1996</ref>\n\nMusic industry writer Christopher Buttner, who interviewed Lee in 1996, described him as a prodigy and \"role model\" for what every musician wants to be, noting his proficiency on stage. Buttner cited Lee's ability to vary time signatures, play multiple keyboards, use bass pedal controllers and control sequencers, all while singing lead vocals into as many as three microphones. Buttner adds that few musicians of any instrument \"can juggle half of what Geddy can do without literally falling on their ass.\"<ref name=Buttner /> As a result, notes Mulhern, Lee's instrumentation was the \"pulse\" of the group and created a \"one-man rhythm section\", which complemented guitarist [[Alex Lifeson]] and percussionist [[Neil Peart]].<ref name=Mulhern /> Bass instructor [[Allan Slutsky]], or \"Dr Licks\", credits Lee's \"biting, high-end bass lines and creative synthesizer work\" for helping the group become \"one of the most innovative\" of all the supergroups that play arena rock.<ref name=Jamerson>Dr Licks. ''Standing in the Shadows of Motown'', Hal Leonard Corp.

However, Lee has also contributed to a body of work outside of his involvement with the band through guest appearances and album production. In 1981, Lee was the featured guest for the hit song \"Take Off\" and its included comedic commentary with [[Bob and Doug McKenzie]] (played by [[Rick Moranis]] and [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]], respectively) for the McKenzie Brothers' comedy album ''[[The Great White North (album)|Great White North]]''.

Lee used [[Music sequencer|sequencers]] early in their development and has continued to use similar innovations as they have developed over the years. Lee has also made use of [[Sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]]. Combined, these electronic devices have supplied many memorable keyboard sounds, such as the \"growl\" in \"Tom Sawyer\" and the percussive melody in the chorus of \"The Spirit of Radio.\"\n\nBeginning with the 1993 album ''Counterparts'', Rush reduced most keyboard- and synthesizer-derived sounds in their compositions. This reached a peak on the 2002 album ''[[Vapor Trails]]'', Rush's first since 1975's ''[[Caress of Steel]]'' to not feature any keyboards or synthesizers. On the 2007 album ''[[Snakes & Arrows]]'', Lee sparingly adds a [[Mellotron]] and bass pedals. However, it does not mark a return to a keyboard-heavy sound for the band. Much like ''Vapor Trails'', the music is primarily recorded with multiple layers of guitars, bass, drums and percussion.\n\n===Live performances: special equipment===\n\n====Recreating unique sounds====\nNewer advances in synthesizer and sampler technology have allowed Lee to store familiar sounds from his old synthesizers alongside new ones in combination synthesizer/samplers, such as the Roland XV-5080. For live shows in 2002 and 2004, Lee and his keyboard technician used the playback capabilities of the XV-5080 to generate virtually all of Rush's keyboard sounds to date, as well as additional complex sound passages that previously required several machines at once to produce.<ref name=\"tpckrn\">[http://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/onstage-09.2002.php \"Rush Rolls Again\", September 2002, ''OnStage Magazine'']</ref>\n\nWhen playing live, Lee and his bandmates recreate their songs as accurately as possible with digital samplers. Using these samplers, the band members are able to recreate, in real-time, the sounds of non-traditional instruments, [[accompaniment]]s, vocal [[harmonies]], and other sound \"events\" that are familiar to those who have heard Rush songs from their albums.\n\nTo trigger these sounds in real-time, Lee uses [[MIDI controller]]s, placed at the locations on the stage where he has a microphone stand. Lee uses two types of MIDI controllers: one type resembles a traditional synthesizer keyboard on a stand (Yamaha KX76). The second type is a large foot-pedal keyboard, placed on the stage floor ([[Korg]] MPK-130, Roland PK-5). Combined, they enable Lee to use his free hands and feet to trigger sounds in electronic equipment that has been placed off-stage.<ref name=\"tpckrn\" /> It is with this technology that Lee and his bandmates are able to present their arrangements in a live setting with the level of complexity and fidelity that fans have come to expect, and without the need to resort to the use of [[backing tracks]] or employing an additional band member.<ref>Peart, Neil [http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/peartbscpresto.htm Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, March 1990, via \"Power Windows\" Rush Fan Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214051150/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/transcripts/peartbscpresto.htm |date=February 14, 2007 }}</ref>  A notable exception of this was during the ''[[Clockwork Angels Tour]]'', when a string ensemble played string parts, which were originally arranged and conducted by [[David Campbell (composer)|David Campbell]] on ''[[Clockwork Angels]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Graff|first=Gary|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/483005/rush-bringing-string-ensemble-on-tour|title=Rush Bringing String Ensemble on Tour|date=18 June 2012|publisher=''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nLee's (and his bandmates') use of MIDI controllers to trigger sampled instruments and audio events is visible throughout the ''[[R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour]]'' concert DVD (2005).\n\nFrom the ''Snakes and Arrows'' tour onwards, Lee used a Roland Fantom X7 and a Moog Little Phatty synthesizer.\n\n====Unique stage equipment====\n[[File:geddy-henhouse.jpg|right|thumb|230px|Henhouse Ovens|[[Rush (band)|Rush]] live in concert with rotisseries and chef in background]]\n\nSince 1996, Lee no longer uses traditional bass amplifiers on stage, opting to have the bass guitar signals input directly to the touring front-of-house console, to improve control and balance of sound reinforcement. Faced with the dilemma of what to do with the empty space left behind by the lack of large amplifier cabinets, Lee chose to decorate his side of the stage with unusual items.\n\nFor the 1996\u20131997 ''[[Test for Echo Tour]]'', Lee's side sported a fully stocked old-fashioned household refrigerator. For the 2002 ''Vapor Trails'' tour, Lee lined his side of the stage with three coin-operated [[Maytag]] [[Clothes dryer|dryers]]. Other large appliances appeared later in the same space. For visual effect they were \"[[microphone|miked]]\" by the sound crew, just as a real amplifier would be. Rush's crew loaded the dryers with specially-designed Rush-themed T-shirts, different from the shirts on sale to the general public. At the close of each show, Lee and Lifeson tossed these T-shirts into the audience. The dryers can be seen while watching the ''[[Rush in Rio]]'' DVD, the ''R40'' DVD, and the ''R30: 30th Anniversary World Tour'' DVD. For the band's [[R30: 30th Anniversary Tour|R30]] tour, one of the three dryers was replaced with a rotating shelf-style [[vending machine]]. It too was fully stocked and operational during shows. For the R40 tour, there were four dryers, as opposed to the usual three dryers.\n\nThe [[Snakes & Arrows Tour]] prominently featured three Henhouse brand rotisserie chicken ovens on stage complete with an attendant in a chef's hat and apron to \"tend\" the chickens during shows.<ref>Jamie Thomson.

During the 2012\u20132013 [[Clockwork Angels Tour]], Lee used a different steampunk device called a \"Geddison\" as a backdrop. This was composed of a giant old-style [[phonograph]] horn, an oversized model brain in a jar, a set of brass horns, and a working [[popcorn]] popper. The 2015 R40 tour combined several of these elements together, with the exception of the chicken ovens used on the ''Snakes and Arrows'' tour.\n\n==Awards==\n* Bass Hall of Fame \u2013 ''[[Guitar

For example, the lower Jurassic Series in [[chronostratigraphy]] corresponds to the early Jurassic Epoch in [[geochronology]].<ref name=ICSchronostrat>{{cite web|author=International Commission on Stratigraphy|title=Chronostratigraphic Units|website=International Stratigraphic Guide|access-date=14 December 2009|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209020034/http://www.stratigraphy.org/upload/bak/chron.htm|archivedate=9 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The adjectives are capitalized when the subdivision is formally recognized, and lower case when not; thus \"early Miocene\" but \"Early Jurassic.\"\n\n==Rationale==\n\nEvidence from [[radiometric dating]] indicates that Earth is about [[age of the Earth|4.54 billion years old]].<ref name=\"USGS1997\">{{cite web\n | date=1997 | title=Age of the Earth\n | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html\n | publisher=U.S. Geological Survey\n | accessdate=2006-01-10\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051223072700/http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/geotime/age.html| archivedate= 23 December 2005 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Dalrymple | first=G.

Different spans of time on the GTS are usually marked by corresponding [[Stratigraphy|changes in the composition of strata]] which indicate major geological or [[paleontology|paleontological]] events, such as [[mass extinction]]s. For example, the boundary between the [[Cretaceous]] period and the [[Paleogene]] period is defined by the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]], which marked the demise of the non-avian [[dinosaur]]s and many other groups of life. Older time spans, which predate the reliable fossil record (before the [[Proterozoic eon]]), are defined by their absolute age.\n\nGeologic units from the same time but different parts of the world often look different and contain different fossils, so the same time-span was historically given different names in different locales. For example, in North America, the Lower [[Cambrian]] is called the Waucoban series that is then subdivided into zones based on succession of [[trilobita|trilobites]]. In [[East Asia]] and [[Siberia]], the same unit is split into [[Alexian]], [[Atdabanian]], and [[Botomian]] stages. A key aspect of the work of the International Commission on Stratigraphy is to reconcile this conflicting terminology and define universal [[Horizon (geology)|horizons]] that can be used around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/bak/status.htm#_2.__PURPOSE_AND_OBJECTIVES|title=Statutes of the International Commission on Stratigraphy|access-date=26 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nSome other [[Planet#Solar System|planets]] and [[Natural satellite|moons]] in the Solar System have sufficiently rigid structures to have preserved records of their own histories, for example, [[Geology of Venus|Venus]], [[Geology of Mars|Mars]] and the [[Geology of the Moon|Earth's Moon]]. Dominantly fluid planets, such as the [[gas giant]]s, do not preserve their history in a comparable manner. Apart from the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]], events on other planets probably had little direct influence on the Earth, and events on Earth had correspondingly little effect on those planets. Construction of a time scale that links the planets is, therefore, of only limited relevance to the Earth's time scale, except in a Solar System context.

Steno argued that rock layers (or strata) were laid down in succession, and that each represents a \"slice\" of time. He also formulated the law of superposition, which states that any given stratum is probably older than those above it and younger than those below it. While Steno's principles were simple, applying them proved challenging. Steno's ideas also lead to other important concepts geologists use today, such as [[relative dating]]. Over the course of the 18th century geologists realized that:\n\n# Sequences of strata often become eroded, distorted, tilted, or even inverted after deposition\n# Strata laid down at the same time in different areas could have entirely different appearances\n# The strata of any given area represented only part of Earth's long history\nThe [[Neptunist]] theories popular at this time (expounded by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Abraham Werner]] (1749\u20131817) in the late 18th century) proposed that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood. A major shift in thinking came when [[James Hutton]] presented his ''Theory of the Earth; or, an Investigation of the Laws Observable in the Composition, Dissolution, and Restoration of Land Upon the Globe''<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| last1                 = Hutton\n| first1                = James\n| author-link1          = James Hutton\n| title                 = Theory of the Earth; or an investigation of the laws observable in the composition, dissolution, and restoration of land upon the Globe\n| url                   = https://archive.org/stream/cbarchive_106252_theoryoftheearthoraninvestigat1788/theoryoftheearthoraninvestigat1788#page/n1/mode/2up\n| journal               = Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh\n| publication-date      = 1788\n| volume                = 1\n| issue                 = 2\n| pages                 = 209\u2013308\n| access-date           = 2016-09-06\n| doi=10.1017/s0080456800029227\n| year                = 2013\n}}\n</ref>\nbefore the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in March and April 1785. [[John McPhee]] asserts that \"as things appear from the perspective of the 20th century, James Hutton in those readings became the founder of modern geology\".<ref name=\"mcphee\">\n{{cite book|first=John|last=McPhee|authorlink=John McPhee|title=Basin and Range|location=New York|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|date=1981}}\n</ref>{{rp|95\u2013100}}\nHutton proposed that the interior of Earth was hot, and that this heat was the engine which drove the creation of new rock: land was eroded by air and water and deposited as layers in the sea; heat then consolidated the sediment into stone, and uplifted it into new lands. This theory, known as \"[[Plutonism]]\", stood in contrast to the \"Neptunist\" flood-oriented theory.\n\n===Formulation of geologic time scale===\nThe first serious attempts to formulate a geologic time scale that could be applied anywhere on Earth were made in the late 18th century. The most influential of those early attempts (championed by [[Abraham Gottlob Werner|Werner]], among others) divided the rocks of Earth's crust into four types: Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary. Each type of rock, according to the theory, formed during a specific period in Earth history. It was thus possible to speak of a \"Tertiary Period\" as well as of \"Tertiary Rocks.\" Indeed, \"Tertiary\" (now Paleogene and Neogene) remained in use as the name of a geological period well into the 20th century and  \"Quaternary\" remains in formal use as the name of the current period.\n\nThe identification of strata by the fossils they contained, pioneered by [[William Smith (geologist)|William Smith]], [[Georges Cuvier]], [[Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy|Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy]], and [[Alexandre Brongniart]] in the early 19th century, enabled geologists to divide Earth history more precisely. It also enabled them to correlate strata across national (or even continental) boundaries. If two strata (however distant in space or different in composition) contained the same fossils, chances were good that they had been laid down at the same time. Detailed studies between 1820 and 1850 of the strata and fossils of Europe produced the sequence of geologic periods still used today.\n\n===Naming of geologic periods, eras and epochs===\nEarly work on developing the geologic time scale was dominated by British geologists, and the names of the geologic periods reflect that dominance. The \"Cambrian\", (the classical name for [[Wales]]) and the \"Ordovician\", and \"Silurian\", named after ancient Welsh tribes, were periods defined using stratigraphic sequences from Wales.<ref name=\"mcphee\"/>{{rp|113\u2013114}} The \"Devonian\" was named for the English county of [[Devon]], and the name \"Carboniferous\" was an adaptation of \"the Coal Measures\", the old British geologists' term for the same set of strata. The \"Permian\" was named after [[Perm]], Russia, because it was defined using strata in that region by Scottish geologist [[Roderick Murchison]]. However, some periods were defined by geologists from other countries. The \"Triassic\" was named in 1834 by a German geologist [[Friedrich Von Alberti]] from the three distinct layers (Latin {{lang|la|trias}} meaning triad)\u2014[[red bed]]s, capped by [[chalk]], followed by black [[shale]]s\u2014that are found throughout Germany and Northwest Europe, called the \u2018Trias\u2019. The \"Jurassic\" was named by a French geologist [[Alexandre Brongniart]] for the extensive marine [[limestone]] exposures of the [[Jura Mountains]]. The \"Cretaceous\" (from Latin ''creta'' meaning \u2018[[chalk]]\u2019) as a separate period was first defined by Belgian geologist [[Jean Baptiste Julien d'Omalius d'Halloy|Jean d'Omalius d'Halloy]] in 1822, using strata in the [[Paris basin]]<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |title=Great Soviet Encyclopedia|publisher=Sovetskaya Enciklopediya|edition=3rd|pages=vol. 16, p. 50|date=1974|location=Moscow|language=Russian|nopp=true|title-link=Great Soviet Encyclopedia}}</ref> and named for the extensive beds of chalk ([[calcium carbonate]] deposited by the shells of marine [[invertebrate]]s) found in Western Europe.\n\nBritish geologists were also responsible for the grouping of periods into eras and the subdivision of the Tertiary and Quaternary periods into epochs. In 1841 [[John Phillips (geologist)|John Phillips]] published the first global geologic time scale based on the types of fossils found in each era. Phillips' scale helped standardize the use of terms like ''[[Paleozoic]]'' (\"old life\") which he extended to cover a larger period than it had in previous usage, and ''[[Mesozoic]]'' (\"middle life\") which he invented.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rudwick|first=Martin|title=Worlds Before Adam: The Reconstruction of Geohistory in the Age of Reform|date=2008|pages= 539\u2013545}}</ref>\n\n===Dating of time scales===\n{{Main|Chronological dating}}\n\nWhen William Smith and [[Sir Charles Lyell]] first recognized that rock strata represented successive time periods, time scales could be estimated only very imprecisely since estimates of rates of change were uncertain. While [[Creationism|creationists]] had been proposing dates of around six or seven thousand years for the age of Earth based on the [[Bible]], early geologists were suggesting millions of years for geologic periods, and some were even suggesting a virtually infinite age for Earth.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Geologists and paleontologists constructed the geologic table based on the relative positions of different strata and fossils, and estimated the time scales based on studying rates of various kinds of [[weathering]], [[erosion]], [[sedimentation]], and [[lithification]]. Until the discovery of [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] in 1896 and the development of its geological applications through [[radiometric dating]] during the first half of the 20th century, the ages of various rock strata and the age of Earth were the subject of considerable debate.\n\nThe first geologic time scale that included absolute dates was published in 1913 by the British geologist [[Arthur Holmes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/subjects/Geologictime.html|title=Geologic Time Scale|publisher = EnchantedLearning.com}}</ref> He greatly furthered the newly created discipline of [[geochronology]] and published the world-renowned book ''The Age of the Earth'' in which he estimated Earth's age to be at least 1.6 billion years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bris.ac.uk/news/2007/5609.html|title=How the discovery of geologic time changed our view of the world|publisher=Bristol University}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, the ''Global Commission on Stratigraphy'' (now the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]]) began to define global references known as GSSP ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|Global Boundary Stratotype Sections and Points]]) for geologic periods and faunal stages.

In situations where the outcome being observed is truly random and consists of [[statistical independence|independent]] trials of a [[random process]], this belief is false. The [[fallacy]] can arise in many situations, but is most strongly associated with [[gambling]], where it is common among players.\n\nThe term \"Monte Carlo fallacy\" originates from the best known [[Gambler's fallacy#Monte Carlo Casino|example]] of the phenomenon, which occurred in the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] in 1913.<ref name= \"monte_carlo\" />\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Coin toss===\n[[File:Lawoflargenumbersanimation2.gif|thumb|100px|Simulation of coin tosses: Each frame, a coin is flipped which is red on one side and blue on the other. The result of each flip is added as a coloured dot in the corresponding column. As the pie chart shows, the proportion of red versus blue approaches 50-50 (the [[Law of Large Numbers|law of large numbers]]). But the [[subtraction|difference]] between red and blue does not systematically decrease to zero.]]\nThe gambler's fallacy can be illustrated by considering the repeated toss of a [[fair coin]]. The outcomes in different tosses are [[statistically independent]] and the probability of getting heads on a single toss is {{sfrac|1|2}} (one in two). The probability of getting two heads in two tosses is {{sfrac|1|4}} (one in four) and the probability of getting three heads in three tosses is {{sfrac|1|8}} (one in eight). In general, if ''A<sub>i</sub>'' is the event where toss ''i'' of a fair coin comes up heads, then:\n:<math>\\Pr\\left(\\bigcap_{i=1}^n A_i\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^n \\Pr(A_i)={1\\over2^n}</math>.\n\nIf after tossing four heads in a row, the next coin toss also came up heads, it would complete a run of five successive heads. Since the probability of a run of five successive heads is {{sfrac|1|32}} (one in thirty-two), a person might believe that the next flip would be more likely to come up tails rather than heads again.\u200aThis is incorrect and is an example of the gambler's fallacy. The event \"5 heads in a row\" and the event \"first 4 heads, then a tails\" are equally likely, each having probability {{sfrac|1|32}}. Since the first four tosses turn up heads, the probability that the next toss is a head is:\n:<math>\\Pr\\left(A_5|A_1 \\cap A_2 \\cap A_3 \\cap A_4 \\right)=\\Pr\\left(A_5\\right)=\\frac{1}{2}</math>.\n\nWhile a run of five heads has a probability of {{sfrac|1|32}} = 0.03125 (a little over 3%), the misunderstanding lies in not realizing that this is the case only before the first coin is tossed. After the first four tosses, the results are no longer unknown, so their probabilities are at that point equal to 1 (100%). The reasoning that it is more likely that a fifth toss is more likely to be tails because the previous four tosses were heads, with a run of luck in the past influencing the odds in the future, forms the basis of the fallacy.\n\n===Why the probability is 1/2 for a fair coin===\nIf a fair coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads is 1 in 2,097,152. The probability of flipping a head after having already flipped 20 heads in a row is {{sfrac|1|2}}. This is an application of [[Bayes' theorem]].\n\nThis can also be shown without knowing that 20 heads have occurred, and without applying Bayes' theorem. Assuming a fair coin:\n* The probability of 20 heads, then 1 tail is 0.5<sup>20</sup> \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5<sup>21</sup>\n* The probability of 20 heads, then 1 head is 0.5<sup>20</sup> \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5<sup>21</sup>\n\nThe probability of getting 20 heads then 1 tail, and the probability of getting 20 heads then another head are both 1 in 2,097,152. When flipping a fair coin 21 times, the outcome is equally likely to be 21 heads as 20 heads and then 1 tail. These two outcomes are equally as likely as any of the other combinations that can be obtained from 21 flips of a coin. All of the 21-flip combinations will have probabilities equal to 0.5<sup>21</sup>, or 1 in 2,097,152. Assuming that a change in the probability will occur as a result of the outcome of prior flips is incorrect because every outcome of a 21-flip sequence is as likely as the other outcomes. In accordance with Bayes' theorem, the likely outcome of each flip is the probability of the fair coin, which is {{sfrac|1|2}}.\n\n===Other examples===\nThe fallacy leads to the incorrect notion that previous failures will create an increased probability of success on subsequent attempts. For a fair 16-sided die, the probability of each outcome occurring is {{sfrac|1|16}} (6.25%). If a win is defined as rolling a 1, the probability of a 1 occurring at least once in 16 rolls is:\n:<math>1-\\left[\\frac{15}{16}\\right]^{16} \\,=\\, 64.39\\%</math>\n\nThe probability of a loss on the first roll is {{sfrac|15|16}} (93.75%). According to the fallacy, the player should have a higher chance of winning after one loss has occurred. The probability of at least one win is now:\n:<math>1-\\left[\\frac{15}{16}\\right]^{15} \\,=\\, 62.02\\%</math>\n\nBy losing one toss, the player's probability of winning drops by two percentage points. With 5 losses and 11 rolls remaining, the probability of winning drops to around 50%. The probability of at least one win does not increase after a series of losses. Instead, the probability of success decreases because there are fewer trials left in which to win. The probability of winning will eventually equal the probability of winning a single toss, which is {{sfrac|1|16}} (6.25%) and occurs when only one toss is left.\n\n==Reverse position==\nAfter a consistent tendency towards tails, a gambler may also decide that tails has become a more likely outcome. This is a rational and Bayesian conclusion, bearing in mind the possibility that the coin may not be fair; it is not a fallacy. Believing the odds to favor tails, the gambler sees no reason to change to heads. However it is a fallacy that a sequence of trials carries a memory of past results which tend to favor or disfavor future outcomes.\n\nThe [[inverse gambler's fallacy]] described by [[Ian Hacking]] is a situation where a gambler entering a room and seeing a person rolling a double six on a pair of dice may erroneously conclude that the person must have been rolling the dice for quite a while, as they would be unlikely to get a double six on their first attempt.\n\n==Retrospective gambler's fallacy==\nResearchers have examined whether a similar bias exists for inferences about unknown past events based upon known subsequent events, calling this the \"retrospective gambler's fallacy\".<ref name= \"retrospective\">Oppenheimer, D.M., & Monin, B. (2009). The retrospective gambler\u2019s fallacy: Unlikely events, constructing the past, and multiple universes. ''Judgment and Decision Making, vol. 4, no. 5,'' pp. 326-334</ref>\n\nAn example of a retrospective gambler's fallacy would be to observe multiple successive \"heads\" on a coin toss and conclude from this that the previously unknown flip was \"tails\".<ref name= \"retrospective\" /> Real world examples of retrospective gambler's fallacy have been argued to exist in events such as the origin of the [[Universe]]. In his book ''Universes'', John Leslie argues that \"the presence of vastly many universes very different in their characters might be our best explanation for why at least one universe has a life-permitting character\".<ref>Leslie, J. (1989). ''Universes''. London: Routledge.</ref> [[Daniel M.

Imagining that the ratio of these births to those of girls ought to be the same at the end of each month, they judged that the boys already born would render more probable the births next of girls.\" The expectant fathers feared that if more sons were born in the surrounding community, then they themselves would be more likely to have a daughter. This essay by Laplace is regarded as one of the earliest descriptions of the fallacy.<ref name=\"BarronLeider2010\">{{cite web|last1=Barron|first1=Greg|last2=Leider|first2=Stephen|title=The role of experience in the Gambler's Fallacy|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~leider/Papers/Gamblers_Fallacy.pdf|date=13 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nAfter having multiple children of the same sex, some parents may believe that they are due to have a child of the opposite sex. While the [[Trivers\u2013Willard hypothesis]] predicts that birth sex is dependent on living conditions, stating that more male children are born in good living conditions, while more female children are born in poorer living conditions, the probability of having a child of either sex is still regarded as near 50%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer-Hague|first=Jaime|date=December 10, 2016|title=Trivers-Willard hypothesis|url=|journal=Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science|volume=|pages=|via=SpringerLink}}</ref>\n\n==Monte Carlo Casino==\nPerhaps the most famous example of the gambler's fallacy occurred in a game of [[roulette]] at the [[Monte Carlo Casino]] on August 18, 1913, when the ball fell in black 26 times in a row. This was an extremely uncommon occurrence: the probability of a sequence of red or black occurring 26 times in a row is ({{sfrac|18|37}})<sup>26-1</sup> or around 1 in 66.6 million, assuming the mechanism is unbiased. Gamblers lost millions of francs betting against black, reasoning incorrectly that the streak was causing an imbalance in the randomness of the wheel, and that it had to be followed by a long streak of red.<ref name= \"monte_carlo\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys|title=Why we gamble like monkeys|work=BBC.com|date=2015-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Non-examples==\n===Non-independent events===\nThe gambler's fallacy does not apply in situations where the probability of different events is not [[statistical independence|independent]]. In such cases, the probability of future events can change based on the outcome of past events, such as the statistical [[permutation]] of events. An example is when cards are drawn from a deck without replacement. If an ace is drawn from a deck and not reinserted, the next draw is less likely to be an ace and more likely to be of another rank. The probability of drawing another ace, assuming that it was the first card drawn and that there are no jokers, has decreased from {{sfrac|4|52}} (7.69%) to {{sfrac|3|51}} (5.88%), while the probability for each other rank has increased from {{sfrac|4|52}} (7.69%) to {{sfrac|4|51}} (7.84%). This effect allows [[card counting]] systems to work in games such as [[blackjack]].\n\n===Bias===\nIn most illustrations of the gambler's fallacy and the reverse gambler's fallacy, the trial (e.g. flipping a coin) is assumed to be fair. In practice, this assumption may not hold. For example, if a coin is flipped 21 times, the probability of 21 heads with a fair coin is 1 in 2,097,152. Since this probability is so small, if it happens, it may well be that the coin is somehow biased towards landing on heads, or that it is being controlled by hidden magnets, or similar.<ref name=\"Gardner1986\">{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Entertaining Mathematical Puzzles|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6MDY0Aw-r9AC|year=1986|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-25211-7|pages=69\u201370|accessdate=2016-03-13}}</ref> In this case, the smart bet is \"heads\" because [[Bayesian inference]] from the [[empirical evidence]] \u2014 21 heads in a row \u2014 suggests that the coin is likely to be biased toward heads. Bayesian inference can be used to show that when the long-run proportion of different outcomes is unknown but [[exchangeable random variables|exchangeable]] (meaning that the random process from which the outcomes are generated may be biased but is equally likely to be biased in any direction) and that previous observations demonstrate the likely direction of the bias, the outcome which has occurred the most in the observed data is the most likely to occur again.<ref>O'Neill, B.; Puza, B.D.

For example, a change in the game rules might favour one player over the other, improving his or her win percentage. Similarly, an inexperienced player's success may decrease after opposing teams learn about and play against his weaknesses. This is another example of bias.\n\n===Impressiveness===\nWhen statistics are quoted, they are usually made to sound as impressive as possible. If a politician says that unemployment has gone down for the past six years, it is a safe bet that seven years ago, it went up.<ref>{{citebook|title=The Guinness Book of Mindbenders|author1=David Wells|author2=Rob Eastaway|author3=Rob Easterway|ISBN=978-0851126685|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n==Psychology behind the fallacy==\n\n===Origins===\nThe gambler's fallacy arises out of a belief in a [[Hasty generalization|law of small numbers]], leading to the erroneous belief that small samples must be representative of the larger population. According to the fallacy, streaks must eventually even out in order to be representative.<ref name=\"Burns2004\">{{cite journal|last1=Burns|first1=Bruce D.|last2=Corpus|first2=Bryan|title=Randomness and inductions from streaks: \"Gambler\u2019s fallacy\" versus \"hot hand\"|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|volume=11|issue=1|year=2004|pages=179\u2013184|issn=1069-9384|doi=10.3758/BF03206480}}</ref> [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] first proposed that the gambler's fallacy is a [[cognitive bias]] produced by a [[heuristics in judgement and decision making|psychological heuristic]] called the [[representativeness heuristic]], which states that people evaluate the probability of a certain event by assessing how similar it is to events they have experienced before, and how similar the events surrounding those two processes are.<ref name=TverskyKahneman1974>{{cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |author2=Daniel Kahneman |year=1974 |volume=185 |title=Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases |journal=Science |pages=1124\u20131131 |doi=10.1126/science.185.4157.1124 |pmid= 17835457 |issue=4157|url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/AD0767426 }}</ref><ref name=TverskyKahneman1971>{{cite journal |last=Tversky |first=Amos |author2=Daniel Kahneman |year=1971 |title=Belief in the law of small numbers |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=76 |issue=2 |pages=105\u2013110 |doi=10.1037/h0031322|url=http://www.nurs.or.jp/~lionfan/small_e.pdf }}</ref> According to this view, \"after observing a long run of red on the roulette wheel, for example, most people erroneously believe that black will result in a more representative sequence than the occurrence of an additional red\",<ref name=TverskyKahneman1974 /> so people expect that a short run of random outcomes should share properties of a longer run, specifically in that deviations from average should balance out. When people are asked to make up a random-looking sequence of coin tosses, they tend to make sequences where the proportion of heads to tails stays closer to 0.5 in any short segment than would be predicted by chance, a phenomenon known as [[insensitivity to sample size]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tune |first=G.

When a person believes that gambling outcomes are the result of their own skill, they may be more susceptible to the gambler's fallacy because they reject the idea that chance could overcome skill or talent.<ref name=SundaliCroson2006 />\n\n===Variations of the gambler's fallacy===\nSome researchers believe that it is possible to define two types of gambler's fallacy: type&nbsp;one and type&nbsp;two. Type&nbsp;one is the classic gambler's fallacy, where individuals believe that a particular outcome is due after a long streak of another outcome. Type&nbsp;two gambler's fallacy, as defined by Gideon Keren and Charles Lewis, occurs when a gambler underestimates how many observations are needed to detect a favorable outcome, such as watching a roulette wheel for a length of time and then betting on the numbers that appear most often. For events with a high degree of randomness, detecting a bias that will lead to a favorable outcome takes an impractically large amount of time and is very difficult, if not impossible, to do.<ref name=\"KerenLewis1994\">{{cite journal|last1=Keren|first1=Gideon|last2=Lewis|first2=Charles|title=The Two Fallacies of Gamblers: Type I and Type II|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=60|issue=1|year=1994|pages=75\u201389|issn=0749-5978|doi=10.1006/obhd.1994.1075}}</ref> The two types differ in that type&nbsp;one wrongly assumes that gambling conditions are fair and perfect, while type&nbsp;two assumes that the conditions are biased, and that this bias can be detected after a certain amount of time.\n\nAnother variety, known as the retrospective gambler's fallacy, occurs when individuals judge that a seemingly rare event must come from a longer sequence than a more common event does. The belief that an imaginary sequence of die rolls is more than three times as long when a set of three sixes is observed as opposed to when there are only two sixes. This effect can be observed in isolated instances, or even sequentially. Another example would involve hearing that a teenager has [[unprotected sex]] and becomes pregnant on a given night, and that she has been engaging in unprotected sex for longer than if we hear she had unprotected sex but did not become pregnant, when the probability of becoming pregnant as a result of each intercourse is independent of the amount of prior intercourse.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Oppenheimer | first1 = D.

In the gambler's fallacy, people predict the opposite outcome of the previous event - negative recency - believing that since the roulette wheel has landed on black on the previous six occasions, it is due to land on red the next. Ayton and Fischer have theorized that people display positive recency for the hot-hand fallacy because the fallacy deals with human performance, and that people do not believe that an inanimate object can become \"hot.\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ayton | first1 = P. | last2 = Fischer | first2 = I. | year = 2004 | title = The hot-hand fallacy and the gambler's fallacy: Two faces of subjective randomness? | url = | journal = Memory and Cognition | volume = 32 | issue = | pages = 1369\u20131378 | doi=10.3758/bf03206327}}</ref> Human performance is not perceived as random, and people are more likely to continue streaks when they believe that the process generating the results is nonrandom.<ref name=\"Burns2004\"/> When a person exhibits the gambler's fallacy, they are more likely to exhibit the hot-hand fallacy as well, suggesting that one construct is responsible for the two fallacies.<ref name=SundaliCroson2006>{{cite journal | last1 = Sundali | first1 = J. | last2 = Croson | first2 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Biases in casino betting: The hot hand and the gambler's fallacy | url = | journal = Judgment and Decision Making | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 1\u201312 }}</ref>\n\nThe difference between the two fallacies is also found in economic decision-making. A study by Huber, Kirchler, and Stockl in 2010 examined how the hot hand and the gambler's fallacy are exhibited in the financial market. The researchers gave their participants a choice: they could either bet on the outcome of a series of coin tosses, use an expert opinion to sway their decision, or choose a risk-free alternative instead for a smaller financial reward. Participants turned to the expert opinion to make their decision 24% of the time based on their past experience of success, which exemplifies the hot-hand. If the expert was correct, 78% of the participants chose the expert's opinion again, as opposed to 57% doing so when the expert was wrong. The participants also exhibited the gambler's fallacy, with their selection of either heads or tails decreasing after noticing a streak of either outcome. This experiment helped bolster Ayton and Fischer's theory that people put more faith in human performance than they do in seemingly random processes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Huber | first1 = J. | last2 = Kirchler | first2 = M. | last3 = Stockl | first3 = T. | year = 2010 | title = The hot hand belief and the gambler's fallacy in investment decisions under risk | url = | journal = Theory and Decision | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 445\u2013462 | doi=10.1007/s11238-008-9106-2}}</ref>\n\n===Neurophysiology===\nWhile the [[representativeness heuristic]] and other cognitive biases are the most commonly cited cause of the gambler's fallacy, research suggests that there may also be a neurological component. [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] has shown that after losing a bet or gamble, known as riskloss, the frontoparietal network of the brain is activated, resulting in more risk-taking behavior. In contrast, there is decreased activity in the [[amygdala]], [[caudate nucleus|caudate]], and [[ventral striatum]] after a riskloss. Activation in the amygdala is negatively correlated with gambler's fallacy, so that the more activity exhibited in the amygdala, the less likely an individual is to fall prey to the gambler's fallacy. These results suggest that gambler's fallacy relies more on the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for executive, goal-directed processes, and less on the brain areas that control [[Affect (psychology)|affective]] decision-making.\n\nThe desire to continue gambling or betting is controlled by the [[striatum]], which supports a choice-outcome contingency learning method. The striatum processes the errors in prediction and the behavior changes accordingly. After a win, the positive behavior is reinforced and after a loss, the behavior is conditioned to be avoided. In individuals exhibiting the gambler's fallacy, this choice-outcome contingency method is impaired, and they continue to make risks after a series of losses.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Xue | first1 = G. | last2 = Lu | first2 = Z. | last3 = Levin | first3 = I.

Educating individuals about the nature of randomness has not always proven effective in reducing or eliminating any manifestation of the fallacy. Participants in a study by Beach and Swensson in 1967 were shown a shuffled deck of index cards with shapes on them, and were instructed to guess which shape would come next in a sequence. The experimental group of participants was informed about the nature and existence of the gambler's fallacy, and were explicitly instructed not to rely on run dependency to make their guesses. The control group was not given this information. The response styles of the two groups were similar, indicating that the experimental group still based their choices on the length of the run sequence. This led to the conclusion that instructing individuals about randomness is not sufficient in lessening the gambler's fallacy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beach | first1 = L. R. | last2 = Swensson | first2 = R.

A study by Fischbein and Schnarch in 1997 administered a questionnaire to five groups: students in grades 5, 7, 9, 11, and college students specializing in teaching mathematics. None of the participants had received any prior education regarding probability. The question asked was: \"Ronni flipped a coin three times and in all cases heads came up. Ronni intends to flip the coin again. What is the chance of getting heads the fourth time?\" The results indicated that as the students got older, the less likely they were to answer with \"smaller than the chance of getting tails\", which would indicate a negative recency effect. 35% of the 5th graders, 35% of the 7th graders, and 20% of the 9th graders exhibited the negative recency effect. Only 10% of the 11th graders answered this way, and none of the college students did. Fischbein and Schnarch theorized that an individual's tendency to rely on the [[representativeness heuristic]] and other cognitive biases can be overcome with age.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fischbein | first1 = E. | last2 = Schnarch | first2 = D. | year = 1997 | title = The evolution with age of probabilistic, intuitively based misconceptions | url = | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 96\u2013105 | doi=10.2307/749665}}</ref>\n\nAnother possible solution comes from Roney and Trick, [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychologists who suggest that the fallacy may be eliminated as a result of grouping. When a future event such as a coin toss is described as part of a sequence, no matter how arbitrarily, a person will automatically consider the event as it relates to the past events, resulting in the gambler's fallacy. When a person considers every event as independent, the fallacy can be greatly reduced.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Roney | first1 = C. J. | last2 = Trick | first2 = L. M. | year = 2003 | title = Grouping and gambling: A gestalt approach to understanding the gambler's fallacy | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 57 | issue = | pages = 69\u201375 | doi=10.1037/h0087414}}</ref>\n\nRoney and Trick told participants in their experiment that they were betting on either two blocks of six coin tosses, or on two blocks of seven coin tosses. The fourth, fifth, and sixth tosses all had the same outcome, either three heads or three tails. The seventh toss was grouped with either the end of one block, or the beginning of the next block. Participants exhibited the strongest gambler's fallacy when the seventh trial was part of the first block, directly after the sequence of three heads or tails. The researchers pointed out that the participants that did not show the gambler's fallacy showed less confidence in their bets and bet fewer times than the participants who picked with the gambler's fallacy. When the seventh trial was grouped with the second block, and was perceived as not being part of a streak, the gambler's fallacy did not occur.\n\nRoney and Trick argued that instead of teaching individuals about the nature of randomness, the fallacy could be avoided by training people to treat each event as if it is a beginning and not a continuation of previous events. They suggested that this would prevent people from gambling when they are losing, in the mistaken hope that their chances of winning are due to increase based on an interaction with previous events.\n\n== Observations of the gambler's fallacy ==\nStudies have found that asylum judges, loan officers, baseball umpires and lotto players employ the gambler's fallacy consistently in their decision-making.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Daniel|last2=Moskowitz|first2=Tobias J.|last3=Shue|first3=Kelly|date=2016-03-24|title=Decision-Making Under the Gambler's Fallacy: Evidence from Asylum Judges, Loan Officers, and Baseball Umpires*|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/03/23/qje.qjw017|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|pages=qjw017|doi=10.1093/qje/qjw017|issn=0033-5533|volume=131}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Suetens|first=Sigrid|last2=Galbo-J\u00f8rgensen|first2=Claus B.|last3=Tyran|first3=Jean-Robert|date=2016-06-01|title=Predicting Lotto Numbers: A Natural Experiment on the Gambler's Fallacy and the Hot-Hand Fallacy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeea.12147/abstract|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=584\u2013607|doi=10.1111/jeea.12147|issn=1542-4774}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Availability heuristic]]\n* [[Gambler's conceit]]\n* [[Gambler's ruin]]\n* [[Inverse gambler's fallacy]]\n* [[Hot hand fallacy]]\n* [[Law of averages]]\n* [[Martingale (betting system)]]\n* [[Mean reversion (finance)]]\n* [[Oscar's grind]]\n* [[Regression toward the mean]]\n* [[Statistical regularity]]\n* [[Problem gambling]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n{{Informal Fallacy}}\n\n[[Category:Behavioral finance]]\n[[Category:Causal fallacies]]\n[[Category:Gambling terminology]]\n[[Category:Statistical paradoxes]]\n[[Category:Cognitive inertia]]\n[[Category:Gambling mathematics]]\n[[Category:Relevance fallacies]]", "sha1": "45j8swvhivn43oy7bjyq2y90cmfvh2s"}}, {"title": "Gun cotton", "ns": "0", "id": "12972", "redirect": {"title": "Nitrocellulose"}, "revision": {"id": "15910618", "parentid": "1924667", "timestamp": "2003-12-10T19:13:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "JidGom", "id": "12033"}, "comment": "Redirect to Notrocellulose which have more info and all that was here", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Nitrocellulose]]", "sha1": "8waivwfojezjj7rripgz0tvuucan91d"}}, {"title": "Gilbert Plains", "ns": "0", "id": "12974", "revision": {"id": "839225673", "parentid": "826902276", "timestamp": "2018-05-02T02:46:42Z", "contributor": {"ip": "128.174.162.241"}, "comment": "/* External links */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about||the former rural municipality|Rural Municipality of Gilbert Plains|the electoral district|Gilbert Plains (electoral district)}}\n{{Location map|Canada Manitoba|lat=51.0859|long=-100.2916|width=200|caption=Location of Gilbert Plains in [[Manitoba]]|label=Gilbert Plains}}\n'''Gilbert Plains''' is an unincorporated urban community in the [[Gilbert Plains Municipality]] within the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[Manitoba]] that held town status prior to January 1, 2015.

He was one of the first proponents of the dialogue with Protestants, after the Reformation.\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Venice]], the eldest son of Alvise Contarini, of the ancient noble  [[House of Contarini]], and his wife Polissena Malpiero.<ref>[http://www.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1535.htm Salvador Miranda, \"Cardinals of the Holy Roman church\"]</ref> After a thorough scientific and philosophical training at the [[University of Padua]], he began his career in the service of his native city. From September 1520 to August 25 he was the Republic's ambassador to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], with whom Venice was [[Italian War of 1521-1526|soon at war]], instructed to defend the Republic's alliance with [[Francis I of France]]. Though he participated at the [[Diet of Worms]], April 1521, he never saw or spoke with [[Martin Luther]]. He accompanied Charles in the Netherlands and Spain.\n\nHe participated at the Congress of Ferrara in 1526 as the Republic's representative; at the Congress the [[League of Cognac]] was formed against the Emperor, allying France with Venice and several states of Italy. Later, after the [[Sack of Rome (1527)|Sack of Rome]] (1527), he assisted in reconciling the emperor with [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], whose release he had obtained, and with the Republic of Bologna. Upon his return to Venice, he was made a senator and a member of the Great Council.\n\nIn 1535, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] unexpectedly made the secular diplomat a cardinal in order to bind an able man of evangelical disposition to the Roman interests. Contarini accepted, but in his new position did not exhibit his former independence. At the time he was promoted to cardinal, May 21, 1535,<ref>The consistory also promoted to the cardinalate [[Desiderius Erasmus]], [[John Fisher]] and [[Jean du Bellay]]</ref> he was still a [[layman]]. However, already in October 1536 he was appointed [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Belluno-Feltre|Bishop of Belluno]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04323c.htm|title=Gasparo Contarini|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia}}</ref> One of the fruits of his diplomatic activity is his ''De magistratibus et republica Venetorum''.\n\nAs Cardinal, Contarini figured among the most prominent of the ''[[Spirituali]]'', the leaders of the movement for reform within the Roman church. In April 1536 Paul III appointed a commission to devise ways for a reformation, with Contarini presiding. Paul III received favorably Contarini's ''[[Consilium de Emendanda Ecclesia]]'', which was circulated among the cardinalate, but it remained a dead letter.  Contarini in a letter to his friend Cardinal [[Reginald Pole]] (dated 11 November 1538) says that his hopes had been wakened anew by the pope's attitude. He and his friends, who formed the Catholic evangelical movement of the [[Spirituali]], thought that all would have been done when the abuses in church life had been put away. What Contarini had to do with it is shown by his letters to the pope in which he complained of the schism in the church, of [[simony]] and flattery in the papal court, but above all of papal tyranny, its least grateful passages. Paul's successor [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]], once a member on the commission, in 1539 put it on the ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]''.\n\nIn 1541 Cardinal Contarini was papal legate at the [[Conference of Regensburg]], the diet and religious debate marking the culmination of attempts to restore religious unity in Germany by means of conferences. There everything was unfavorable; the Catholic states were bitter, the Evangelicals were distant. Contarini's instructions though apparently free were in fact full of papal reservations. But the papal party had gladly sent him, thinking that through him a union in doctrine could be brought about, while the interest of Rome could be attended to later. Though the princes stood aloof, the theologians and the emperor were for peace, so the main articles were put forth in a formula, Evangelical in thought and Catholic in expression. The papal legate had revised the Catholic proposal and assented to the formula agreed upon. All gave their approval, even [[Johann Eck]], though he later regretted it.\n\nContarini's theological advisor was [[Tommaso Badia]]; his own position is shown in a treatise on justification, composed at [[Regensburg]], which in essential points is Evangelical, differing only in the omission of the negative side and in being interwoven with the teaching of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]]. Meanwhile, the papal policy had changed, and Contarini was compelled to follow his leader. He advised the emperor, after the conference had broken up, not to renew it, but to submit everything to the pope.\n\n[[Ignatius Loyola]] acknowledged that Cardinal Contarini was largely responsible for the papal approbation of the [[Society of Jesus]],  on September 27, 1540. Meanwhile, Rome had drifted further into reaction, and Contarini died while legate at Bologna, at a time when the [[Inquisition]] had driven many of his friends and fellows in conviction into exile.\n[[file:Madonna dell'Orto (Venice) - Chapel Contarini - Gasparo Contarini (1483-1542) by Danese Cattaneo (ca 1563).jpg|thumb|His tomb in the church of the [[Madonna dell'Orto]]]]\n\n==The Commonwealth and Government of Venice==\n[[File:Contarini - De republica Venetorum, 1626 - 117.tif|thumb|''De republica Venetorum'', 1626.]]\nContarini's book ''De magistratibus et republica venetorum'' (Paris, 1543) is an important source for the study of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Venice's unique system of government. It was published in an English translation in 1599.<ref>Gasparo Contarini, ''The Commonwealth and Government of Venice'', trans. [[Lewes Lewkenor]], 1599</ref> This magisterial work, written during his time as an ambassador to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], extols the various institutions of the Venetian state in a manner designed to emphasize harmony, fairness and serenity. Historians<ref>R. Finlay, ''Politics in Renaissance Venice''</ref> have demonstrated that this text represents Contarini's idealization of Venetian reality. Probably written for a foreign, courtly audience, this work functions as the source for the everlasting propagation of the \"myth of Venice\" as a stable, unchanging and prosperous society.\n\nHis depiction of how members of the council were elected to the senate, for example, aimed to emphasise the way the electoral system prevented factionalism from occurring, instead making sure that \u201cpublic benefits are largely extended among the citizens\u201d rather than narrowly amongst \u201cone family\u201d . An elaborate lottery is described as giving the maximum amount of chance in appointing patricians to particular offices, and care is taken to point out if two of one family are standing for similar posts. Fairness is further emphasised in Contarini\u2019s constant references to the equality the members of the council enjoyed. They \u201csit down where it pleases them, for there is no place appointed to any\u201d, and they \u201cwith oath promise to do their utmost diligence, that the laws may be observed\u201d . He creates an image of disparate individuals, with factions broken up by the guiding hand of the law, working to ensure those in positions of importance are fairly chosen from their number and without the capacity to serve the interests of a smaller group.\n\nContarini\u2019s depiction of the Doge lucidly demonstrates the way in which this figure embodies both the conscious illusion of a resplendent monarchical ruler and an equally conscious demonstration of a regime that wishes to portray itself as ruled by many limiting the powers of one. This calculated duality means that Contarini\u2019s doge, which the second book of De magistratibus is almost entirely devoted to discussing, represents the closest point in his text to what actually occurred, because the Doge served as a literal embodiment of the idealisation of the reality of Venetian politics. For Contarini, this duality almost defines the greatness of the Venetian constitution. The Doge is the \u201cheart\u201d, under which \u201call are comprised\u201d . Contarini places him in the centre of his body metaphor, making him synecdochical for the city and the people that reside within it. This means he is to ensure that the disparate, competing interests of the city beat in time with one another, creating in the process the \u201cperfection of civil agreement\u201d. His job as a conductor, rather than a ruler, means therefore that the role takes on the aspect of representative of the entire city. Contarini\u2019s description of his vestments, privileges and rituals can therefore be compared to [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marin Sanudo]]\u2019s<ref>Marin Sanudo, \u2018In Praise of the City of Venice\u2019, in Venice: A Documentary History, ed. Brian Pullen and David Chambers, p8</ref> description of the physical spaces of Venice in his essay ''In Praise of Venice''. Both are designed to extol the virtues of the entire city by describing representative parts. This is apparent in the way both authors treat the chapel of St. Mark. Patron saints were hugely important in terms of civic self-identification in renaissance Italy . Contarini emphasizes this, saying that he is \u201cwith exceeding honour solemnized of the Venetians\u201d . His description of the Doge\u2019s close relationship with the saint, through the \u201csolemn pomp\u201d  with which he attends mass at the saint\u2019s chapel, attaches him to the aforementioned \u201cexceeding honour\u201d, in a similar fashion to the way in which Sanudo glorifies Venice as a whole by constantly referring to the beauty and worth of St. Mark\u2019s square and chapel  as part of his panoramic praise of the city.\n\nAt the same time, however, Contarini\u2019s overall purpose is, of course, the glorification of the republican nature of his city. Therefore, he cannot avoid referring to \u201cthe other side\u201d of the Doge\u2019s figure when discussing his \u201croyal appearing show\u201d  . Things like the \u201ckingly ornaments\u201d which were \u201calways purple garments or cloth of gold\u201d, both very ostentatious assertions of wealth and power, were to ensure he was \u201crecompensed\u201d for his \u201climitation of authority\u201d . Contarini thus openly concludes that the Doge is a combination of myth and reality, saying that \u201cin everything you may see the show of a king, but his authority is nothing\u201d . Indeed, as Edward Muir<ref>E. Muir, Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice, p286</ref> points out, \u201cby the sixteenth century virtually every word, gesture and act that the doge made in public was subject to legal and ceremonial regulation\u201d . He could not buy expensive jewels, own property outside Venice or the Veneto, display his insignia outside the Ducal Palace, decorate his apartment as he wanted, receive people in his ducal dress, send official letters, or have close ties with guilds, amongst a great many other restrictions. Legally, therefore, power in Venice came from the numerous councils, not the figurehead. The Doge thus becomes a brazen republican statement. Venice drew attention to a princely, magnificently adorned figurehead, only to direct most executive power to councils of her citizens.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pope Paul III]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Schaff-Herzog}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Gleason, Elisabeth G.

Doroshevich-Sakhalin. Part I. Prisoners on Steamship of Voluntary Fleet.png|thumb|Group of prisoners in [[Sakhalin]], remote prison island, c. 1903]]\nThe [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Tsardom of Russia|Tsar]] first invented the exile in [[Siberia]] as a punishment within the judicial system: [[Katorga]], a category of punishment within the judicial system of the Russian Empire, had many of the features associated with labor-camp imprisonment: confinement, simplified facilities (as opposed to prisons), and forced labor, usually involving hard, unskilled or semi-skilled work. Katorga camps were established in the 17th century in underpopulated areas of Siberia and the [[Russian Far East]] \u2013 regions that had few towns or food sources and lacked any organized transportation systems. Despite the isolated conditions, a few prisoners successfully escaped to populated areas. After the change in Russian penal law in 1847, exile and katorga became common punishment for participants in national uprisings within the Russian Empire. This led to increasing numbers of [[Poles]] sent to Siberia for katorga. From these times, Siberia gained its fearful connotation of punishment, which was further enhanced by the Soviet GULAG system.\n\nDuring 1920\u201350, the leaders of the Communist Party and the Soviet state considered repression to be a tool that was to be used for securing the normal functioning of the Soviet state system, as well as for preserving and strengthening the positions within their social base, the working class (when the Bolsheviks took power, peasants represented 80% of the population).<ref name=\"\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u0413\u0423\u041b\u0410\u0413 (\u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u043a\u043e-\u0441\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442)|journal=\u0421\u043e\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0438\u0441\u0441\u043b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f|year=1991|issue=\u2116 6,7|url=http://scepsis.ru/library/id_937.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}</ref> The GULAG system was introduced in order to isolate and eliminate class-alien, socially dangerous, disruptive, suspicious, and other disloyal elements, whose deeds and thoughts were not contributing to the strengthening of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].<ref name=\"\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\" /> Forced labor as a \"method of reeducation\" was applied in [[Solovki prison camp]] as early as the 1920s,<ref name=\"ApplebaumChapter3\">Applebaum, \"Gulag: A History\", Chapter 3</ref> based on [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]]'s experiments with forced labor camps for Czech war prisoners from 1918 and his proposals to introduce \"compulsory labor service\" voiced in ''Terrorism and Communism''.<ref name=\"ApplebaumChapter3\" /><ref>\"The only way to attract the labor power necessary for our economic problems is to introduce compulsory labor service\", in: {{cite web|title = Leon Trotsky: Terrorism and Communism (Chapter 8)|url = https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1920/terrcomm/ch08.htm|website = www.marxists.org|accessdate = August 6, 2015|first = Leon|last = Trotsky}}</ref>\n\nAccording to journalist [[Anne Applebaum]], approximately 6,000 [[katorga]] convicts were serving sentences in 1906 and 28,600 in 1916.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /><ref>\"[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/11/books/review/11MINERT.html {{-'}}Gulag': The Other Killing Machine]\".

After Lenin's death in 1924, [[Stalin]] was able to take control of the government, and began to form the gulag system.  On June 27, 1929 the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] created a system of self-supporting camps that would eventually replace the existing prisons around the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=9}}</ref> These prisons were meant to receive inmates that received a prison sentence that exceeded three years.  Prisoners that had a shorter prison sentence than three years were to remain in the prison system that was still under the purview of the [[NKVD]].  The purpose of these new camps was to colonize the remote and inhospitable environments throughout the Soviet Union. These changes took place around the same time that Stalin started to institute collectivization and rapid industrial development. [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|Collectivization]] resulted in a large scale purge of peasants and so-called [[Kulaks]]. The Kulaks were supposedly wealthy (comparatively to other Soviet peasants) and were considered to be capitalists by the state, and by extension enemies of socialism. By late 1929 Stalin started a program known as \"[[dekulakization]]\". Stalin demanded that the kulak class be completely wiped out. This resulted in the imprisonment and execution of Soviet peasants. The term \"Kulak\" would also become associated with anyone who opposed or even seemed unsatisfied with the Soviet government. This resulted in 60,000 people being sent to the camps and another 154,000 exiled in a mere four months. This was only the beginning of the dekulakization process. In 1931 alone 1,803,392 people were exiled.<ref>{{cite book|last1=khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=11}}</ref> Although these massive relocation processes were successful in getting a large potential free forced labor work force where they needed to be, that is about all it was successful at doing.  The \"special settlers\", as the Soviet government referred to them, all lived on starvation level rations, and many people starved to death in the camps, and anyone who was healthy enough to escape tried to do just that. This resulted in the government having to give rations to a group of people they were getting hardly any use out of, and was just costing the Soviet government money. The Unified State Political Administration (OGPU) quickly realized the problem, and began to reform the dekulakization process. To help prevent the mass escapes the [[OGPU]] started to recruit people within the colony to help stop people who attempted to leave, and set up ambushes around known popular escape routes. The [[OGPU]] also attempted to raise the living conditions in these camps that would not encourage people to actively try and escape, and Kulaks were promised that they would regain their rights after five years. Even these revisions ultimately failed to resolve the problem, and the dekulakization process was a failure in providing the government with a steady forced labor force. These prisoners were also lucky to be in the gulag in the early 1930s. Prisoners were relatively well off compared to what the prisoners would have to go through in the final years of the gulag.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Khlevniuk|first1=Oleg|title=The History of the Gulag|date=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=17}}</ref>\n\n=== During World War II ===\n\n==== Political role ====\n[[File:Kolyma road00.jpg|thumb|Road construction by inmates of the ''[[Dalstroy]]'' (part of the '[[R504 Kolyma Highway|Road of Bones]]' from Magadan to [[Yakutsk]])]]\n\nOn the eve of [[World War II]], Soviet archives indicate a combined camp and colony population upwards of 1.6 million in 1939, according to V.

They were initially intended for [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]], but then other categories of political prisoners (for example, members of [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported peoples]] who fled from exile) were also sentenced to \"katorga works\". Prisoners sentenced to \"katorga works\" were sent to Gulag prison camps with the most harsh regime and many of them perished.<ref name=\"gulag1\" />\n\n==== Economic role ====\n[[File:Political prisoners in Gulag.jpg|thumb|Political prisoners eating lunch in the [[Intalag]] coal mine]]\n[[File:Central shop in Norilsk in 1957.jpg|thumb|Central shop in [[Norilsk]] built by prisoners of the [[Norillag]]]]\n[[File:Logging at Small Ungut.jpeg|thumb|Lithuanian deportees preparing logs for rafting on the [[Mana River]]]]\nUp until World War II, the Gulag system expanded dramatically to create a Soviet \"camp economy\". Right before the war, forced labor provided 46.5% of the nation's [[nickel]], 76% of its [[tin]], 40% of its [[cobalt]], 40.5% of its chrome-iron ore, 60% of its gold, and 25.3% of its timber.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\"/>  And in preparation for war, the NKVD put up many more factories and built highways and railroads.\n\nThe Gulag quickly switched to production of arms and supplies for the army after fighting began. At first, transportation remained a priority. In 1940 the NKVD focused most of its energy on railroad construction.<ref name=khlev>{{cite book | last= Khevniuk | first= Oleg V.|title= The History of the Gulag: From Collectivization to the Great Terror|year= 2004|publisher= Yale University Press|pages= 236\u2013286}}</ref> This would prove extremely important when the German advance into the Soviet Union started in 1941. In addition, factories converted to produce ammunition, uniforms, and other supplies. Moreover, the NKVD gathered skilled workers and specialists from throughout the Gulag into 380 special colonies which produced tanks, airplanes, armaments, and ammunition.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\">{{cite book|last= Ivanova|first= Galina Mikhailovna|title= Labor Camp Socialism: The Gulag in the Soviet Totalitarian System|year= 2000|publisher= Sharpe|location= Armonk, NY|pages= 69\u2013126}}</ref>\n\nDespite its low capital costs, the camp economy suffered from serious flaws. For one, actual productivity almost never matched estimates: the estimates proved far too optimistic. In addition, scarcity of machinery and tools plagued the camps, and the tools that the camps did have quickly broke. The Eastern Siberian Trust of the Chief Administration of Camps for Highway Construction destroyed ninety-four trucks in just three years.<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> But the greatest problem was simple \u2013 forced labor was less efficient than free labor. In fact, prisoners in the Gulag were, on average, half as productive as free laborers in the USSR at the time,<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> which may be partially explained by malnutrition.\n\nTo make up for this disparity, the NKVD worked prisoners harder than ever. To meet rising demand, prisoners worked longer and longer hours, and on lower food-rations than ever before. A camp administrator said in a meeting: \"There are cases when a prisoner is given only four or five hours out of twenty-four for rest, which significantly lowers his productivity.\" In the words of a former Gulag prisoner: \"By the spring of 1942, the camp ceased to function. It was difficult to find people who were even able to gather firewood or bury the dead.\"<ref name=\"Ivanova: labor camps\" /> The scarcity of food stemmed in part from the general strain on the entire Soviet Union, but also lack of central aid to the Gulag during the war. The central government focused all its attention on the military, and left the camps to their own devices. In 1942 the Gulag set up the Supply Administration to find their own food and industrial goods. During this time, not only did food become scarce, but the NKVD limited rations in an attempt to motivate the prisoners to work harder for more food, a policy that lasted until 1948.<ref name=ebacon>{{cite book|last= Bacon|first= Edwin|title= The Gulag at War: Stalin's Forced Labour System in the Light of the Archives|year= 1994|publisher= New York University Press|location= New York, NY|pages= 42\u201363, 82\u2013100, 123\u2013144}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to food shortages, the Gulag suffered from labor scarcity at the beginning of the war. The [[Great Purge|Great Terror]] of 1936\u20131938 had provided a large supply of free labor, but by the start of World War II the purges had slowed down. In order to complete all of their [[project]]s, camp administrators moved prisoners from project to project.<ref name=khlev /> To improve the situation, laws were implemented in mid-1940 that allowed giving short camp sentences (4 months or a year) to those convicted of petty theft, hooliganism, or labor-discipline infractions. By January 1941 the Gulag workforce had increased by approximately 300,000 prisoners.<ref name=khlev /> But in 1942 serious food shortages began, and camp populations dropped again. The camps lost still more prisoners to the war effort. (The Soviet Union went into total war footing in June 1941.) Many laborers received early releases so that they could be drafted and sent to the front.<ref name=ebacon />\n\nEven as the pool of workers shrank, demand for outputs continued to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to \"do more with less\". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators had to find a way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labor resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The speed of [[Operation Barbarossa]]'s advance prevented the evacuation of all laborers in good time, and the NKVD [[NKVD prisoner massacres|massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands]]. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labor, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of laborers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.<ref name=ebacon />\n\n=== After World War II ===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Labor camp.jpg|thumb|Upper Debin Camp, painted by former prisoner [[Nikolai Getman]]]] -->\n[[File:Transpolar Railway between Salekhard and Nadym.jpg|thumb|[[Salekhard\u2013Igarka Railway|Transpolar Railway]] was a project of the Gulag system that took place from 1947 to 1953.]]\nAfter World War II the number of inmates in prison camps and colonies, again, rose sharply, reaching approximately 2.5 million people by the early 1950s (about 1.7 million of whom were in camps).\n\nWhen the war in Europe ended in May 1945, as many as two million former Russian citizens were [[Operation Keelhaul|forcefully repatriated into the USSR]].<ref>Mark Elliott. \"The United States and Forced Repatriation of Soviet Citizens, 1944\u201347,\" ''Political Science Quarterly'', Vol. 88, No. 2 (June 1973), pp. 253\u2013275.</ref> On February 11, 1945, at the conclusion of the [[Yalta Conference]], the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] signed a Repatriation Agreement with the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"darkside\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |title=Repatriation \u2013 The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=Fff.org |date= |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117182523/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0895a.asp |archivedate=January 17, 2012 }}</ref> One interpretation of this agreement resulted in the forcible repatriation of all Soviets.

However, to one degree or another, the large majority of prisoners at most times faced meager food rations, inadequate clothing, overcrowding, poorly insulated housing, poor hygiene, and inadequate health care. Most prisoners were compelled to perform harsh physical labor.<ref>[http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 The Gulag Collection: Paintings of Nikolai Getman]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127121250/http://www.jamestown.org/getman_paintings.php?painting_id=29 |date=November 27, 2007 }}</ref> In most periods and economic branches, the degree of mechanization of work processes was significantly lower than in the civilian industry: tools were often primitive and machinery, if existent, short in supply. Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official work time regulations were extended by local camp administrators.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n[[Andrei Vyshinsky]], procurator of the Soviet Union, wrote a memorandum to [[NKVD]] chief [[Nikolai Yezhov]] in 1938 which stated:\n\n<blockquote>Among the prisoners there are some so ragged and liceridden that they pose a sanitary danger to the rest.

Besides a wide array of punishments for prisoners refusing to work (which, in practice, were sometimes applied to prisoners that were too enfeebled to meet [[production quota]]), they instituted a number of positive incentives intended to boost productivity. These included monetary bonuses (since the early 1930s) and wage payments (from 1950 onwards), cuts of individual sentences, general early-release schemes for norm fulfillment and overfulfillment (until 1939, again in selected camps from 1946 onwards), preferential treatment, and privileges for the most productive workers ([[Udarnik|shock workers]] or [[Stakhanovite movement|Stakhanovites]] in Soviet parlance).<ref name=\"borodkin\">Leonid Borodkin and Simon Ertz 'Forced Labor and the Need for Motivation: Wages and Bonuses in the Stalinist Camp System', ''Comparative Economic Studies'', June 2005, Vol.47, Iss. 2, pp. 418\u2013436.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shack from Gulag - Museum of the Occupation of Latvia.JPG|thumb|Shack from Gulag \u2013 reconstruction in [[Museum of the Occupation of Latvia]]]]\n\nA distinctive incentive scheme that included both coercive and motivational elements and was applied universally in all camps consisted in standardized \"nourishment scales\": the size of the inmates' ration depended on the percentage of the work quota delivered. [[Naftaly Frenkel]] is credited for the introduction of this policy. While it was effective in compelling many prisoners to work harder, for many a prisoner it had the adverse effect, accelerating the exhaustion and sometimes causing the death of persons unable to fulfill high production quota.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nImmediately after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German attack on the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 the conditions in camps worsened drastically: quotas were increased, rations cut, and medical supplies came close to none, all of which led to a sharp increase in mortality. The situation slowly improved in the final period and after the end of the war.\n\nConsidering the overall conditions and their influence on inmates, it is important to distinguish three major strata of Gulag inmates:\n\n*\"[[Kulak]]s\", [[osadnik]]s, \"[[ukaznik]]s\" (people sentenced for violation of various [[ukase]]s, such as [[Law of Spikelets]], decree about work discipline, etc.), occasional violators of [[criminal law]]\n*Dedicated criminals: \"[[thieves in law]]\"\n*People sentenced for various [[political prisoner|political]] and religious reasons.\n\nMortality in Gulag camps in 1934\u201340 was 4\u20136 times higher than average in the Soviet Union. The estimated total number of those who died in imprisonment in 1930\u201353 is at least 1.76 million, about half of which occurred between 1941\u201343 following the German invasion.<ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php \"Demographic Losses Due to Repressions\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{ru icon}}</ref><ref>[http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300092844 \"The History of the GULAG\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622052449/http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300092844 |date=June 22, 2010 }}, by [[Oleg V.

The law was later relaxed on 8 May 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/staff/mharrison/archive/persa/010fulltext.pdf|title=Theft Under Stalin: A Property Rights Analysis|last=Gorlizki|first=Yoram|date=28 June 2001|accessdate=7 March 2017}}</ref> Overall, during the first half of 1933, prisons saw more new incoming inmates than the three previous years combined.\n\nPrisoners in the camps faced harsh working conditions. One Soviet report stated that, in early 1933, up to 15% of the prison population in [[Uzbekistan]] died monthly. During this time, prisoners were getting around {{convert|300|Cal|kJ}} worth of food a day. Many inmates attempted to flee, causing an upsurge in corrosive and violent measures.

Until 1934, lack of food and the outbreak of diseases started to destabilize the Gulag system. It wasn't until the famine ended that the system started to stabilize.\n\n=== Social conditions ===\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2014}}\n\nThe convicts in such camps were actively involved in all kinds of labor with one of them being [[logging]] (''lesopoval''). The working territory of logging presented by itself a square and was surrounded by forest clearing. Thus, all attempts to exit or escape from it were well observed from the four towers set at each of its corners.\n\nLocals who captured a [[Fugitive|runaway]] were given rewards.<ref>\"[http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ Nikolai Getman: The Gulag Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513172402/http://www.jamestown.org/aboutus/getmanpaintings/getmancatalog/ |date=May 13, 2012 }}\"</ref> It is also said that Gulags in colder areas were less concerned with finding escaped prisoners as they would die anyhow from the severely cold winters.

Remote monasteries in particular were frequently reused as sites for new camps. The site on the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]] is one of the earliest and also most noteworthy, taking root soon after the Revolution in 1918.<ref name=\"Applebaum 2003\" /> The [[colloquial]] name for the islands, \"[[Solovki prison camp|Solovki]]\", entered the [[vernacular]] as a [[synonym]] for the labor camp in general. It was presented to the world as an example of the new Soviet method for \"re-education of [[class enemy|class enemies]]\" and reintegrating them through labor into Soviet society. Initially the inmates, largely Russian [[intelligentsia]], enjoyed relative freedom (within the natural confinement of the islands). Local newspapers and magazines were published and even some scientific research was carried out (e.g., a local botanical garden was maintained but unfortunately later lost completely). Eventually Solovki turned into an ordinary Gulag camp; in fact some historians maintain that it was a pilot camp of this type. In 1929 [[Maxim Gorky]] visited the camp and published an apology for it. The report of Gorky's trip to Solovki was included in the cycle of impressions titled \"Po Soiuzu Sovetov,\" Part V, subtitled \"Solovki.\" In the report, Gorky wrote that \"camps such as 'Solovki' were absolutely necessary.\"<ref name=Yedlin>{{cite book|last=Yedlin|first=Tova|title=Maxim Gorky: A Political Biography|year=1999|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-275-96605-4|page=188 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zxt5_vI_ozcC&pg=PA188}}</ref>\n\nWith the new emphasis on Gulag as the means of concentrating cheap labor, new camps were then constructed throughout the Soviet sphere of influence, wherever the economic task at hand dictated their existence (or was designed specifically to avail itself of them, such as the [[White Sea-Baltic Canal]] or the [[Baikal Amur Mainline]]), including facilities in big cities \u2014 parts of the famous [[Moscow Metro]] and the [[Moscow State University]] new campus were built by forced labor. Many more projects during the rapid industrialization of the 1930s, [[World War II|war-time]] and post-war periods were fulfilled on the backs of convicts. The activity of Gulag camps spanned a wide cross-section of Soviet industry. Gorky organised in 1933 a trip of 120 writers and artists to the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal, 36 of them wrote a propaganda book about the construction published in 1934 and destroyed in 1937.\n\n[[File:Yagoda kanal Moskva Volga.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Genrikh Yagoda]] (middle) inspecting the construction of the [[Moscow Canal|Moscow-Volga canal]].

However, camps were generally spread throughout the entire [[Soviet Union]], including the European parts of [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]]. There were several camps outside the Soviet Union, in [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], and [[Mongolia]], which were under the direct control of the Gulag.\n\nNot all camps were fortified; some in Siberia were marked only by posts. Escape was deterred by the harsh elements, as well as tracking dogs that were assigned to each camp. While during the 1920s and 1930s native tribes often aided escapees, many of the tribes were also [[victimized]] by escaped thieves. Tantalized by large rewards as well, they began aiding authorities in the capture of Gulag inmates. Camp guards were given stern incentive to keep their inmates in line at all costs; if a prisoner escaped under a guard's watch, the guard would often be stripped of his uniform and become a Gulag inmate himself.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Further, if an escaping prisoner was shot, guards could be fined amounts that were often equivalent to one or two weeks wages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n[[File:Ru200008020027.jpg|thumb|upright|Part of 'Project 503' to build a railroad from [[Salekhard]] to [[Igarka]] near [[Turukhansk]] on the [[Yenisey]]]]\n\nIn some cases, teams of inmates were dropped off in new territory with a limited supply of resources and left to set up a new camp or die.

It is well known that practically every one of them had several branches, many of which were quite large. In addition to the large numbers of camps, there were no less than 2,000 colonies.

The first approach was championed by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, and is what Barnes terms the 'moral explanation'. According to this view, Soviet ideology eliminated the moral checks on the darker side of human nature \u2013 providing convenient justifications for violence and evil-doing on all levels: from political decision-making to personal relations. Another approach is the 'political explanation', according to which the Gulag (along with executions) was primarily a means for eliminating the regime's perceived political enemies (this understanding is favored, among others, by historian Robert Conquest). The 'economic explanation', in turn as set out by historian Anne Applebaum, argues that the Soviet regime instrumentalized the Gulag for its economic development projects. Although never economically profitable, it was perceived as such right up to Stalin's death in 1953. Finally, Barnes advances his own, fourth explanation, which situates the Gulag in the context of modern projects of 'cleansing' the social body of hostile elements, through spatial isolation and physical elimination of individuals defined as harmful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Death and Redemption: The Gulag and the Shaping of Soviet Society|last=Barnes|first=Stephen A.|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2011|isbn=978-0-691-15112-0|location=Princeton|pages=7\u201316|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Hannah Arendt]] argued that as part of a [[totalitarian]] system of government, the camps of the Gulag system were experiments in \"total domination.\" In her view, the goal of a totalitarian system was not merely to establish limits on liberty, but rather to abolish liberty entirely in service of its ideology. She argues that the Gulag system was not merely political repression because the system survived and grew long after Stalin had wiped out all serious political resistance. Although the various camps were initially filled with criminals and political prisoners, eventually they were filled with prisoners who were arrested irrespective of anything relating to them as individuals, but rather only on the basis of their membership in some ever shifting category of imagined threats to the state.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 437 \u2013 59</ref>\n\nShe also argues that the function of the Gulag system was not truly economic. Although the Soviet government deemed them all \"forced labor\" camps, this in fact highlighted that the work in the camps was deliberately pointless, since all Russian workers could be subject to forced labor.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Hannah Arendt ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', Harcourt 1985 edition, at 444 \u2013 45</ref> The only real economic purpose they typically served was financing the cost of their own supervision. Otherwise the work performed was generally useless, either by design or made that way through extremely poor planning and execution; some workers even preferred more difficult work if it was actually productive. She differentiated between \"authentic\" forced-labor camps, concentration camps, and \"annihilation camps\". In authentic labor camps, inmates worked in \"relative freedom and are sentenced for limited periods.\" Concentration camps had extremely high mortality rates and but were still \"essentially organized for labor purposes.\" Annihilation camps were those where the inmates were \"systematically wiped out through starvation and neglect.\" She criticizes other commentators' conclusion that the purpose of the camps was a supply of cheap labor. According to her, the Soviets were able to liquidate the camp system without serious economic consequences, showing that the camps were not an important source of labor and were overall economically irrelevant.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nArendt argues that together with the systematized, arbitrary cruelty inside the camps, this served the purpose of total domination by eliminating the idea that the arrestees had any political or legal rights. Morality was destroyed by maximizing cruelty and by organizing the camps internally to make the inmates and guards complicit. The terror resulting from operation of the Gulag system caused people outside of the camps to cut all ties with anyone who was arrested or purged and to avoid forming ties with others for fear of being associated with anyone who was targeted. As a result, the camps were essential as the nucleus of a system that destroyed individuality and dissolved all social bonds. Thereby, the system attempted to eliminate any capacity for resistance or self-directed action in the greater population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== Archival documents ===\nStatistical reports made by the [[OGPU]]-[[NKVD]]-[[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]]-[[MVD]] between the 1930s and 1950s are kept in the [[State Archive of the Russian Federation]] formerly called Central State Archive of the October Revolution (CSAOR).

On the one hand, their administration was not interested to understate the number of prisoners in its reports, because it would have automatically led to a decrease in the food supply plan for camps, prisons, and corrective labor colonies. The decrement in food would have been accompanied by an increase in mortality that would have led to wrecking of the vast production program of the Gulag. On the other hand, overstatement of data of the number of prisoners also did not comply with departmental interests, because it was fraught with the same (i.e., impossible) increase in production tasks set by planning bodies. In those days, people were highly responsible for non-fulfilment of plan. It seems that a resultant of these objective departmental interests was a sufficient degree of reliability of the reports.<ref name=\"\u0420\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438\">{{cite journal|last=\u0417\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432|first=\u0412\u0438\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440|title=\u041f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438 \u0432 \u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420 (1917\u20131990 \u0433\u0433.).|journal=\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f XXI|year=1994|issue=\u2116 1\u20132|pages=107\u2013124|url=http://kob.rv.ua/doki-dai/dotu/other/zemskov/zemskov_politrepressii(1917\u20131990).pdf|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992, the first precise statistical data on the Gulag based on the Gulag archives were published by [[Viktor Zemskov]].<ref name=\"Rousso, Golsan\">{{cite book|last1=Rousso|first1=Henry|authorlink1=Henry Rousso|last2=Golsan|first2=Richard|title=Stalinism and nazism: history and memory compared|year=2004|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-9000-4|page=92|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CIt7fMp30sAC&printsec=frontcover#PPA92,M1}}</ref> These had been generally accepted by leading Western scholars,<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /><ref name=Ellman_SRS />  despite the fact that a number of inconsistencies were found in this statistics.<ref name= Vishnevsky /> It is also necessary to note that not all the conclusions drawn by Zemskov based on his data have been generally accepted.

He added that without distinguishing the degree of accuracy and reliability of certain figures, without making a critical analysis of sources, without comparing new data with already known information, Zemskov absolutizes the published materials by presenting them as the ultimate truth.

As a rule, they were situated in remote parts of the USSR, and labour conditions were extremely hard there. They formed a core of the GULAG system. The inmates of \"corrective labour colonies\" served shorter terms; these colonies were located in less remote parts of the USSR, and they were run by local NKVD administration.<ref name=\"GRZ\" /> Preliminary analysis of the GULAG camps and colonies statistics (see the chart on the right) demonstrated that the population reached the maximum before the World War II, then dropped sharply, partially due to massive releases, partially due to wartime high mortality, and then was gradually increasing until the end of Stalin era, reaching the global maximum in 1953, when the combined population of GULAG camps and labour colonies amounted to 2,625,000.<ref name=\"Anatoly Vishnevsky\">[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema05.php \"The Total Number of Repressed\"], by [[Anatoly Vishnevsky]], Director of the Center for Human Demography and Ecology, [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{ru icon}}</ref>\n\nThe results of these archival studies convinced many scholars, including [[Robert Conquest]]<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> or Stephen Wheatcroft to reconsider their earlier estimates of the size of the GULAG population, although the 'high numbers' of arrested and deaths are not radically different from earlier estimates.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Although such scholars as Rosefielde or Vishnevsky point at several inconsistencies in archival data with Rosefielde pointing out the archival figure of 1,196,369 for the population of the Gulag and labor colonies combined on December 31, 1936 is less than half the 2.75 million labor camp population given to the Census Board by the NKVD for the 1937 census,<ref>http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/soviet/rosefielde.pdf</ref><ref name= Vishnevsky>Vishnevsky, Alantoly. \u0414\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0438 \u043e\u0442 \u0440\u0435\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439 (The Demographic Loss of Repression), Demoscope Weekly, December 31, 2007, [http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2007/0313/tema06.php retrieved] April 13, 2011</ref> it is generally believed that these data provide more reliable and detailed information that the indirect data and literary sources available for the scholars during the Cold War era.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> Although Conquest cited Beria's report to the Politburo of the labor camp numbers at the end of 1938 stating there were almost 7 million prisoners in the labor camps, more than three times the archival figure for 1938 and an official report to Stalin by the Soviet minister of State Security in 1952 stating there were 12 million prisoners in the labor camps.<ref>https://www.bu.edu/iscip/pubseries/PubSeries1conquest.pdf</ref>\n\nThese data allowed scholars to conclude that during the period of 1928\u201353, about 14 million prisoners passed through the system of GULAG ''labour camps'' and 4\u20135 million passed through the ''labour colonies''.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" /> Thus, these figures reflect the number of convicted persons, and do not take into account the fact that a significant part of Gulag inmates had been convicted more than one time, so the actual number of convicted is somewhat overstated by these statistics.<ref name=Ellman_SRS /> From other hand, during some periods of Gulag history the official figures of GULAG population reflected the camps' capacity, not the actual amount of inmates, so the actual figures were 15% higher in, e.g. 1946.<ref name=\"ConquestGRZ\" />\n\n== Influence ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}\n\n=== Culture ===\n<!-- this section is for the general influence on the Soviet culture of **Gulag itself**, not a list of publications about Gulag -->\n\nThe Gulag spanned nearly four decades of Soviet and East European history and affected millions of individuals. Its cultural impact was enormous.\n\nThe Gulag has become a major influence on contemporary Russian thinking, and an important part of modern [[Russian folklore]].  Many songs by the authors-performers known as the [[Bard (Soviet Union)|''bards'']], most notably [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]], neither of whom ever served time in the camps, describe life inside the Gulag and glorified the life of \"Zeks\". Words and phrases which originated in the labor camps became part of the Russian/Soviet vernacular in the 1960s and 1970s.\nThe memoirs of [[Alexander Dolgun]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Varlam Shalamov]] and [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]], among others, became a symbol of defiance in Soviet society.  These writings harshly chastised the Soviet people for their tolerance and apathy regarding the Gulag, but at the same time provided a testament to the courage and resolve of those who were imprisoned.\n\nAnother cultural phenomenon in the Soviet Union linked with the Gulag was the forced migration of many artists and other people of culture to Siberia. This resulted in a Renaissance of sorts in places like [[Magadan]], where, for example, the quality of theatre production was comparable to [[Moscow]]'s and [[Eddie Rosner]] played jazz.\n\n==== Literature ====\nMany eyewitness accounts of Gulag prisoners have been published:\n\n* [[Varlam Shalamov]]'s ''[[The Kolyma Tales|Kolyma Tales]]'' is a short-story collection, cited by most major works on the Gulag, and widely considered one of the main Soviet accounts.\n* [[Victor Kravchenko (defector)|Victor Kravchenko]] wrote ''I Chose Freedom'' after defecting to the [[United States]] in 1944. As a leader of industrial plants he had encountered forced labor camps in across the Soviet Union from 1935 to 1941. He describes a visit to one camp at [[Kemerovo]] on the [[Tom River]] in Siberia. Factories paid a fixed sum to the [[KGB]] for every convict they employed.\n* [[Anatoli Granovsky]] wrote ''I Was an NKVD Agent'' after [[Defection|defecting]] to [[Sweden]] in 1946 and included his experiences seeing gulag prisoners as a young boy, as well as his experiences as a prisoner himself in 1939. Granovsky's father was sent to the gulag in 1937.\n* [[Julius Margolin]]'s book ''A Travel to the Land Ze-Ka'' was finished in 1947, but it was impossible to publish such a book about the Soviet Union at the time, immediately after World War II.\n* [[Gustaw Herling-Grudzi\u0144ski]] wrote ''A World Apart'', which was translated into English by Andrzej Ciolkosz and published with an introduction by [[Bertrand Russell]] in 1951. By describing life in the gulag in a harrowing personal account, it provides an in-depth, original analysis of the nature of the Soviet communist system.\n* [[Victor Herman]]'s book ''Coming out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life''. Herman experienced firsthand many places, prisons, and experiences that Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was able to reference in only passing or through brief second hand accounts.\n* [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]'s book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' was not the first literary work about labor camps. His previous book on the subject, \"[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]\", about a typical day in the life of a Gulag inmate, was originally published in the most prestigious Soviet monthly, ''[[Novy Mir]]'' (''New World''), in November 1962, but was soon banned and withdrawn from all libraries. It was the first work to demonstrate the Gulag as an instrument of governmental repression against its own citizens on a massive scale. ''[[The First Circle]]'', an account of three days in the lives of prisoners in the ''[[Marfino]]'' ''[[sharashka]]'' or special prison was submitted for publication to the Soviet authorities shortly after ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' but was rejected and later published abroad in 1968.\n* [[Slavomir Rawicz]]'s book \"[[The Long Walk: The True Story of a Trek to Freedom]]\": In 1941, the author and six other fellow prisoners escaped a Soviet labor camp in Yakutsk\u2014a camp where enduring hunger, cold, untended wounds, untreated illnesses, and avoiding daily executions were everyday horrors. \n* [[J\u00e1nos R\u00f3zs\u00e1s]], a Hungarian writer, often referred to as the Hungarian Solzhenitsyn,<ref>https://www.raptisrarebooks.com/product/one-day-in-the-life-of-ivan-denisovich-inscribed-first-edition-alexander-solzhenitsyn-signed/</ref> wrote many books and articles on the issue of the Gulag.\n*[[Zoltan Szalkai]], a Hungarian documentary filmmaker, made several films about gulag camps.\n* [[Karlo \u0160tajner]], a Croatian communist who was active in the former [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the manager of the [[Comintern Publishing House]] in Moscow 1932\u201339, was arrested one night and taken from his Moscow home after being accused of anti-revolutionary activities. He spent the next 20 years in camps from Solovki to Norilsk. After USSR\u2013[[Yugoslavia]]n political normalization he was re-tried and quickly found innocent. He left the Soviet Union with his wife, who had been waiting for him for 20 years, in 1956 and spent the rest of his life in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]]. He wrote an impressive book titled ''7000 days in Siberia''.\n* ''Dancing Under the Red Star'' by [[Karl Tobien]] ({{ISBN|1-4000-7078-3}}) tells the story of Margaret Werner, an athletic girl who moves to Russia right before the start of Stalin's terror. She faces many hardships, as her father is taken away from her and imprisoned. Werner is the only American woman who survived the Gulag to tell about it.\n* ''Alexander Dolgun's Story: An American in the Gulag'' ({{ISBN|0-394-49497-0}}), by a member of the US Embassy, and ''I Was a Slave in Russia'' ({{ISBN|0-8159-5800-5}}), an American factory owner's son, were two more American citizens interned who wrote of their ordeal. They were interned due to their American citizenship for about eight years c. 1946\u201355.\n* [[Yevgenia Ginzburg]] wrote two famous books about her remembrances, ''Journey Into the Whirlwind'' and ''Within the Whirlwind''.\n*[[Savi\u0107 Markovi\u0107 \u0160tedimlija]], a pro-[[Croatia]]n Montenegrin ideologist. Caught in [[Austria]] by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, he was sent to the USSR and spent ten years in the Gulag. After his release, Markovi\u0107 wrote his autobiographical account in two volumes titled ''Ten years in Gulag'' (''Deset godina u Gulagu'', Matica crnogorska, Podgorica, Montenegro 2004).\n* [[Ani\u021ba Nandri\u0219-Cudla]]'s book, ''20 Years in Siberia [20 de ani \u00een Siberia]'' is the own life's account written by a Romanian peasant woman from Bucovina (Mahala village near Cern\u0103u\u021bi) who managed to survive the harsh, forced labour system together with her three sons.  Together with her husband and her three underage children, she was deported from Mahala village to the Soviet  Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug, at the Polar Circle, without a trial or even a communicated accusation. The same night of June 12 to 13, 1941, (that is before the breakout of the Second World War), overall 602 fellow villagers were arrested and deported, without any prior notice. Her mother received the same sentence but was spared from deportation after the fact that she was a paraplegic was acknowledged by the authorities.  It was later discovered that the reason for her deportation and forced labour was the fake and nonsensical claim that, allegedly, her husband had been a mayor in the Romanian administration, a politician and a rich peasant, none of the latter of which was true. Separated from her husband, she brought up the three boys, overcame  [[typhus]], [[scorbutus]], [[malnutrition]], extreme cold and harsh toils, to later return to Bucovina after rehabilitation. Her manuscript was written toward the end of her life, in the simple and direct language of a peasant with 3 years of public school education, and was secretly brought to Romania before the fall of Romanian communism, in 1982. Her manuscript was first published in 1991. Her deportation was shared mainly with Romanians from Bucovina and Basarabia, Finnish and Polish prisoners, as token proof to show that Gulag labour camps had also been used for the shattering/ extermination of the natives in the newly occupied territories of the Soviet Union.\n* [[Frantsishak Alyakhnovich]] \u2013 Solovki prisoner\n* [[Blagoy Popov]], a Bulgarian communist and a defendant in the [[Leipzig trial]], along with [[Georgi Dimitrov]] and [[Vasil Tanev]], was arrested in 1937 during the [[Stalinist purges]] and spent seventeen years in [[Norillag]]. Popov was released in 1954, after the death of Stalin, and returned to [[Bulgaria]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438|last=\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u0432|first=\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0439|publisher=\u0418\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \"\u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434\"|year=2012|isbn=978-619-152-025-1|location=\u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f|pages=37, 57}}</ref> He wrote his autobiographical account in the book ''From the Leipzig trial to the Siberia camps'' (''\u041e\u0442 \u041b\u0430\u0439\u043f\u0446\u0438\u0433\u0441\u043a\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0446\u0435\u0441 \u0432 \u0421\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u0438'', \u0418\u0437\u0442\u043e\u043a-\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0430\u0434, \u0421\u043e\u0444\u0438\u044f, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f, 2012 {{ISBN|978-619-152-025-1}}).\n\n=== Colonization ===\n[[File:Vorkuta r.jpg|thumb|The city of [[Vorkuta]]]]\nSoviet [[wikisource:\u041e\u0431 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u0434\u0430 \u0443\u0433\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e-\u0437\u0430\u043a\u043b\u044e\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445|state documents]] show that the goals of the gulag included colonization of sparsely populated remote areas.

In addition, for persons who served full term, but who were denied the free choice of place of residence, it was recommended to assign them for \"free settlement\" and give them land in the general vicinity of the place of confinement.\n\nThe gulag inherited this approach from the [[katorga]] system.\n\nIt is estimated that of the 40,000 people collecting state pensions in [[Vorkuta Gulag|Vorkuta]], 32,000 are trapped former gulag inmates, or their descendants.<ref>Robert Conquest, Paul Hollander: Political violence: belief, behavior, and legitimation p.55, Palgrave Macmillan;(2008) {{ISBN|978-0-230-60646-3}}</ref>\n\n=== Life after term served ===\nPersons who served a term in a camp or in a prison were restricted from taking a wide range of jobs.

Also known as a '''Geiger-Mueller counter''' (or '''Geiger-M\u00fcller counter'''), it is widely used in applications such as radiation [[dosimetry]], [[radiological protection]], [[experimental physics]], and the [[nuclear industry]].\n\nIt detects ionizing radiation such as [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, and [[gamma ray]]s using the ionization effect produced in a [[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube]], which gives its name to the instrument.<ref name=\"cent\" /> In wide and prominent use as a [[Survey meter|hand-held radiation survey instrument]], it is perhaps one of the world's best-known [[Particle Detector|radiation detection]] instruments.\n\nThe original detection principle was realized in 1908, at the [[Cavendish laboratory]], but it was not until the development of the Geiger-M\u00fcller tube in 1928 that the Geiger counter could be produced as a practical instrument. Since then, it has been very popular due to its robust sensing element and relatively low cost. However, there are limitations in measuring high radiation rates and the [[Electronvolt|energy]] of incident radiation.<ref name=\"knoll\" />\n\n==Principle of operation==\n[[File:Geiger-Muller-counter-en.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Schematic of a Geiger counter using an \"end window\" tube for low penetration radiation. A loudspeaker is also used for indication]]\n{{Main article|Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube}}\nA Geiger counter consists of a Geiger-M\u00fcller tube (the sensing element which detects the radiation) and the processing electronics, which displays the result.\n\nThe Geiger-M\u00fcller tube is filled with an inert gas such as [[helium]], [[neon]], or [[argon]] at low pressure, to which a high voltage is applied. The tube briefly conducts electrical charge when a [[Elementary particle|particle]] or [[photon]] of incident radiation makes the gas conductive by ionization.  The ionization is considerably amplified within the tube by the [[Townsend discharge]] effect to produce an easily measured detection pulse, which is fed to the processing and display electronics. This large pulse from the tube makes the Geiger counter relatively cheap to manufacture, as the subsequent electronics are greatly simplified.<ref name=\"knoll\" />   The electronics also generate the high voltage, typically 400\u2013900 volts, that has to be applied to the Geiger-M\u00fcller tube to enable its operation. To stop the discharge in the Geiger-M\u00fcller tube a little halogen gas or organic material (alcohol) is added to the gas mixture.\n\n===Readout===\nThere are two types of detected radiation readout: [[Counts per minute|counts]] or [[Absorbed dose|radiation dose]]. The counts display is the simplest and is the number of ionizing events detected displayed either as a count rate, such as \"counts per minute\" or \"counts per second\", or as a total number of counts over a set time period (an integrated total). The counts readout is normally used when alpha or beta particles are being detected. More complex to achieve is a display of radiation dose rate, displayed in a unit such as the [[sievert]] which is normally used for measuring gamma or X-ray dose rates. A Geiger-M\u00fcller tube can detect the presence of radiation, but not its [[Electronvolt|energy]], which influences the radiation's ionizing effect. Consequently, instruments measuring dose rate require the use of an [[Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube#Energy compensation|energy compensated]] Geiger-M\u00fcller tube, so that the dose displayed relates to the counts detected.<ref name=\"knoll\">Glenn F Knoll. ''Radiation Detection and Measurement'', third edition 2000. John Wiley and sons, {{ISBN|0-471-07338-5}}</ref> The electronics will apply known factors to make this conversion, which is specific to each instrument and is determined by design and calibration.\n\nThe readout can be analog or digital, and modern instruments are offering serial communications with a host computer or network.\n\nThere is usually an option to produce audible [[Media:Geiger panic.ogg|clicks]] representing the number of ionization events detected. This is the distinctive sound normally associated with hand held or portable Geiger counters. The purpose of this is to allow the user to concentrate on manipulation of the instrument whilst retaining auditory feedback on the radiation rate.\n\n===Limitations===\nThere are two main limitations of the Geiger counter. Because the output pulse from a Geiger-M\u00fcller tube is always of the same magnitude (regardless of the energy of the incident radiation), the tube cannot differentiate between radiation types.<ref name=\"knoll\" /> Secondly, the inability to measure high radiation rates due to the \"dead time\" of the tube. This is an insensitive period after each ionization of the gas during which any further incident radiation will not result in a count, and the indicated rate is, therefore, lower than actual. Typically the dead time will reduce indicated count rates above about 10<sup>4</sup> to 10<sup>5</sup> counts per second depending on the characteristic of the tube being used.<ref name=\"knoll\" /> While some counters have circuitry which can compensate for this, for accurate measurements [[ion chamber]] instruments are preferred for high radiation rates.\n\n==Types and applications==\n[[File:Geiger counter 2.jpg|thumb|Geiger counter with pancake type probe]]\n[[File:Geiger counter in use.jpg|thumb|Laboratory use of a Geiger counter with end-window probe to measure beta radiation]]\nThe intended detection application of a Geiger counter dictates the tube design used. Consequently, there are a great many designs, but they can be generally categorized as \"end-window\", windowless \"thin-walled\", \"thick-walled\", and sometimes hybrids of these types.\n\n===Particle detection===\nThe first historical uses of the Geiger principle were for the detection of alpha and beta particles, and the instrument is still used for this purpose today. For alpha particles and low energy beta particles, the \"end-window\" type of a Geiger-M\u00fcller tube has to be used as these particles have a limited range and are easily [[Stopping power (particle radiation)|stopped]] by a solid material. Therefore, the tube requires a window which is thin enough to allow as many as possible of these particles through to the fill gas. The window is usually made of mica with a density of about 1.5 - 2.0&nbsp;mg/cm<sup>2</sup>.<ref name=\"cent\" />\n\nAlpha particles have the shortest range, and to detect these the window should ideally be within 10&nbsp;mm of the radiation source due to alpha particle [[attenuation]].<ref name=\"cent\" /> However, the Geiger-M\u00fcller tube produces a pulse output which is the same magnitude for all detected radiation, so a Geiger counter with an end window tube cannot distinguish between alpha and beta particles.<ref name=\"knoll\" /> A skilled operator can use varying distance from a radiation source to differentiate between alpha and high energy beta particles.\n\nThe \"pancake\" Geiger-Muller tube is a variant of the end-window probe, but designed with a larger detection area to make checking quicker. However, the pressure of the atmosphere against the low pressure of the fill gas limits the window size due to the limited strength of the window membrane.\n\nSome beta particles can also be detected by a thin-walled \"windowless\" Geiger-M\u00fcller tube, which has no end-window, but allows high energy beta particles to pass through the tube walls. Although the tube walls have a greater stopping power than a thin end-window, they still allow these more energetic particles to reach the fill gas.<ref name=\"cent\" />\n\nEnd-window Geiger counters are still used as a general purpose, portable, [[radioactive contamination]] measurement and detection instrument, owing to their relatively low cost, robustness and their relatively high detection efficiency; particularly with high energy beta particles.<ref name=\"knoll\" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://xn--messgert-test-hfb.de/geigerzaehler/|title=G-M detector function and measuring methods|last=|first=|date=|access-date=2017-03-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}</ref> However, for discrimination between alpha and beta particles or provision of particle energy information, [[scintillation counter]]s or [[proportional counter]]s should be used.<ref name = \"ukhse\"/> Those instrument types are manufactured with much larger detector areas, which means that checking for surface contamination is quicker than with a Geiger counter.\n\n===Gamma and X-ray detection===\nGeiger counters are widely used to detect [[gamma radiation]], and for this the windowless tube is used. However, efficiency is generally low due to the poor interaction of gamma rays compared with alpha and beta particles. For instance, a chrome steel G-M tube is only about 1% efficient over a wide range of energies.<ref name=\"cent\">\u2019\u2019Geiger Muller Tubes; issue 1\u2019\u2019 published by Centronics Ltd, UK.</ref> Better suited to detect gamma rays is the scintillation detector which has a much greater sensitivity to gamma rays than a geiger detector.\n\nThe article on the [[Geiger-Muller tube]] carries a more detailed account of the techniques used to detect [[photon]] radiation. For high energy gamma it largely relies on interaction of the photon radiation with the tube wall material, usually 1\u20132&nbsp;mm of [[Low-background steel|chrome steel]] on a \"thick-walled\" tube, to produce electrons within the wall which can enter and ionize the fill gas.<ref name=\"knoll\" /> This is necessary as the low-pressure gas in the tube has little interaction with high energy gamma photons. However, for low energy photons there is greater gas interaction and the direct gas ionisation effect increases. With decreasing energy the wall effect gives way to a combination of wall effect and direct ionisation, until direct gas ionisation dominates. Due to the variance in response to different photon energies, windowless tubes employ what is known as \"energy compensation\" which attempts to compensate for these variations over a large energy range.<ref name=\"cent\" />\n\nLow energy photon radiation such as low energy X rays or gamma rays interacts better with the fill gas. Consequently, a typical design for low energy photon detection for these is a long tube with a thin wall or with an end window. The tube has a larger gas volume than a steel walled tube to give an increased chance of particle interaction.<ref name=\"cent\" />\n\n===Neutron detection===\n[[File:boroncounter.svg|lang=en|thumb|Geiger tube filled with BF<sub>3</sub> for detection of thermal neutrons]]\nA variation of the Geiger tube is used to measure [[neutron]]s, where the gas used is [[boron trifluoride]] or helium-3 and a plastic moderator is used to slow the neutrons. This creates an [[alpha particle]] inside the detector and thus neutrons can be counted.\n\n===Gamma measurement\u2014personnel protection and process control===\nThe term \"Geiger counter\" is commonly used to mean a hand-held survey type meter, however the Geiger principle is in wide use in installed \"area gamma\" alarms for personnel protection, and in process measurement and interlock applications.\nA Geiger tube is still the sensing device, but the processing electronics will have a higher degree of sophistication and reliability than that used in a hand held survey meter.\n\n===Physical design===\n[[File:Geiger tube si8b.jpg|thumb|right|Pancake G-M tube used for alpha and beta detection; the delicate mica window is usually protected by a mesh when fitted in an instrument.]]\nFor hand-held units there are two fundamental physical configurations: the \"integral\" unit with both detector and electronics in the same unit, and the \"two-piece\" design which has a separate detector probe and an electronics module connected by a short cable.\n\nIn the 1930s a mica window was added to the cylindrical design allowing low-penetration radiation to pass through with ease.<ref name=\"Korff, SNTM 2012\">Korff, SNTM (2012) 20: 271. {{doi|10.1007}} / s00048-012-0080-y</ref>\n\nThe integral unit allows single-handed operation, so the operator can use the other hand for personal security in challenging monitoring positions, but the two piece design allows easier manipulation of the detector, and is commonly used for alpha and beta surface contamination monitoring where careful manipulation of the probe is required or the weight of the electronics module would make operation unwieldy. A number of different sized detectors are available to suit particular situations, such as placing the probe in small apertures or confined spaces.\n\nGamma and X-Ray detectors generally use an \"integral\" design so the Geiger\u2013M\u00fcller tube is conveniently within the electronics enclosure. This can easily be achieved because the casing usually has little attentuation, and is employed in ambient gamma measurements where distance from the source of radiation is not a significant factor. However, to facilitate more localised measurements such as \"surface dose\", the position of the tube in the enclosure is sometimes indicated by targets on the enclosure so an accurate measurement can be made with the tube at the correct orientation and a known distance from the surface.\n\nThere is a particular type of gamma instrument known as a \"hot spot\" detector which has the detector tube on the end of a long pole or flexible conduit. These are used to measure  high radiation gamma locations whilst protecting the operator by means of distance shielding.\n\nParticle detection of alpha and beta can be used in both integral and two-piece designs. A pancake probe (for alpha/beta) is generally used to increase the area of detection in two-piece instruments whilst being relatively light weight. In integral instruments using an end window tube there is a window in the body of the casing to prevent shielding of particles.  There are also hybrid instruments which have a separate probe for particle detection and a gamma detection tube within the electronics module. The detectors are switchable by the operator, depending the radiation type that is being measured.\n\n===Guidance on application use===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]] the [[National Radiological Protection Board]] issued a user guidance note on selecting the best portable  instrument type for the radiation measurement application concerned.<ref name = \"ukhse\">[http://files.site-fusion.co.uk/webfusion117640/file/instrumentsirp7.pdf.pdf] Selection, use and maintenance of portable monitoring instruments.

This covers all radiation protection instrument technologies and includes a guide to the use of G-M detectors.\n\n==History==\n[[File:PSM V87 D120 Apparatus for counting alpha particles.png|thumb|right|An early alpha particle counter designed by Rutherford and Geiger.]]\n[[image:Early Geiger counter, made by Hans Geiger, 1932.

The first usage outside of the immediate Boston area appeared in the ''[[Newburyport Herald]]'' (Massachusetts) on 31 March, and the first use outside of Massachusetts came in the ''Concord Gazette'' (New Hampshire) on 14 April 1812.\n\nThe first use outside of New England was published in the ''New York Gazette & General Advertiser'' on 19 May. What may be the first use of the term to describe the [[redistricting]] in another state (Maryland) occurred in the ''Federal Republican'' (Georgetown, D.C.)<!-- Georgetown was technically distinct from the city of Washington until 1871. --> on 12 October 1812. All in all, there are at least 80 known citations of the word from March through December 1812 in American newspapers. {{cite journal |first=Kenneth C. |last=Martis |title=The Original Gerrymander |journal=Political Geography |volume=27 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=833\u2013839 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2008.09.003 }}</ref> This suggests some organized activity of the Federalists to disparage Governor Gerry in particular, and the growing Democratic-Republican party in general.

When the party controlling the districting process has a statewide majority, packing is usually not necessary to attain partisan advantage; the minority party can generally be \"cracked\" everywhere. Packing is therefore more likely to be used for partisan advantage when the party controlling the districting process has a statewide minority, because by forfeiting a few districts packed with the opposition, cracking can be used in forming the remaining districts.\n* \"Hijacking\" redraws two districts in such a way as to force two incumbents to run against each other in one district, ensuring that one of them will be eliminated.<ref name=\"ProP201111022\" />\n* \"Kidnapping\" moves an incumbent's home address into another district.<ref name=\"ProP201111022\" /> Reelection can become more difficult when the incumbent no longer resides in the district, or possibly faces reelection from a new district with a new voter base. This is often employed against politicians who represent multiple urban areas, in which larger cities will be removed from the district in order to make the district more rural.\n\nThese tactics are typically combined in some form, creating a few \"forfeit\" seats for packed voters of one type in order to secure more seats and greater representation for voters of another type. This results in candidates of one party (the one responsible for the gerrymandering) winning by small majorities in most of the districts, and another party winning by a large majority in only a few of the districts.\n\n==Examples of gerrymandered districts==\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Globalize|section|date=June 2018}}\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|[[File:North Carolina 12th Congressional District (National Atlas).gif|frameless]]\n|{{ushr|North Carolina|12|}} between 2003 and 2016 was an example of packing.

''Wasted votes'' are votes that did not contribute to electing a candidate, either because they were in excess of the bare minimum needed for victory or because the candidate lost. By moving geographic boundaries, the incumbent party packs opposition voters into a few districts they will already win, wasting the extra votes. Other districts are more tightly constructed with the opposition party allowed a bare minority count, thereby wasting all the minority votes for the losing candidate. These districts constitute the majority of districts and are drawn to produce a result favoring the incumbent party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231865/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering - politics|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nA quantitative measure of the effect of gerrymandering is the [[wasted vote#Efficiency gap|efficiency gap]], computed from the difference in the wasted votes for two different political parties summed over all the districts. When the parties win district elections in rough proportion to their electoral popularity, the efficiency gap is near zero.<ref name=\"82UofCLawReview\">{{Cite journal |last=Stephanopoulos |first=Nicholas |last2=McGhee |first2=Eric |year=2014 |title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap |ssrn=2457468 |journal=University of Chicago Law Review |volume=82 |page=831 }}</ref><ref name=\"NewRepublic20140702\">{{Cite magazine |last=Stephanopoulos |first=Nicholas |date=July 2, 2014 |title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering |magazine=The New Republic |access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref>  Citing in part an efficiency gap of 11.69% to 13%, a U.S. District Court in 2016 ruled against the 2011 drawing of Wisconsin legislative districts.

To minimize the risk of demographic or political shifts swinging a district to the opposition, politicians can create more packed districts, leading to more comfortable margins in unpacked ones.\n\n===Effect on electoral competition===\n\n[[File:Gerrymandering 9-6.png|thumb|How gerrymandering can influence electoral results on a [[Voting system#Nonproportional and semiproportional methods|non-proportional system]].

Some say that, rather than packing the voters of their party into uncompetitive districts, party leaders tend to prefer to spread their party's voters into multiple districts, so that their party can win a larger number of races.<ref>Seth E. Masket, Jonathan Winburn and Gerald C.

Instead of gerrymandering, some researchers find that other factors, such as partisan polarization and the incumbency advantage, have driven the recent decreases in electoral competition.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forgette|first1=Richard|last2=Winkle|first2=John W.|title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Voting Rights Act*|journal=Social Science Quarterly|date=March 2006|volume=87|issue=1|pages=155\u2013173|doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2006.00374.x}}</ref> Similarly, a 2009 study found that \"congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCarty|first1=Nolan|last2=Poole|first2=Keith T.|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Howard|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|journal=American Journal of Political Science|date=July 2009|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666\u2013680|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~miaryc/PEW/Nolan_McCarty_PEWCaltech.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThese findings are, however, a matter of some dispute. While gerrymandering may not decrease electoral competition in all cases, there are certainly instances where gerrymandering does reduce such competition.\n\nOne state in which gerrymandering has arguably had an adverse effect on electoral competition is California. In 2000, a bipartisan redistricting effort redrew congressional district lines in ways that all but guaranteed incumbent victories; as a result, California saw only one congressional seat change hands between 2000 and 2010. In response to this obvious gerrymandering, a 2010 referendum in California gave the power to redraw congressional district lines to the [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission]], which had been created to draw California State Senate and Assembly districts by another referendum in 2008. In stark contrast to the redistricting efforts that followed the 2000 census, the redistricting commission has created a number of the most competitive congressional districts in the country.<ref>{{cite news |last=Nagourney |first=Adam |date=14 February 2012 |title=New Faces Set For California in the Capitol  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/us/california-congressional-delegation-braces-for-change.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Increased incumbent advantage and campaign costs===\nThe effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as incumbents are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists [[Norman Ornstein]] and [[Thomas E. Mann|Thomas Mann]], only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, the lowest number in modern American history.<ref name=\"7_buck_trust.html\">{{cite web|url=http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html |title=Iowa's Redistricting Process: An Example of the Right Way to Draw Legislative |publisher=Centrists.Org |date=22 July 2004 |accessdate=5 August 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107114029/http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html |archivedate=7 November 2009}}</ref> Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and incumbents are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.\n\nMann, a Senior Fellow of Governance Studies at the [[Brookings Institution]], has also noted that \"Redistricting is a deeply political process, with incumbents actively seeking to minimize the risk to themselves (via bipartisan gerrymanders) or to gain additional seats for their party (via partisan gerrymanders)\".<ref>Mann, Thomas E. \"Redistricting Reform.\" The Brookings Institution. Brookings.edu, 1 June 2005. Web. 5 February 2013. <http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2005/06/01politics-mann></ref> The bipartisan gerrymandering that Mann mentions refers to the fact that legislators often also draw distorted legislative districts even when such redistricting does not provide an advantage to their party.\n\nGerrymandering of state legislative districts can effectively guarantee an incumbent's victory by 'shoring up' a district with higher levels of partisan support, without disproportionately benefiting a particular political party. This can be highly problematic from a governance perspective, because forming districts to ensure high levels of partisanship often leads to higher levels of partisanship in legislative bodies. If a substantial number of districts are designed to be polarized, then those districts' representation will also likely act in a heavily partisan manner, which can create and perpetuate partisan gridlock.\n\nThis demonstrates that gerrymandering can have a deleterious effect on the principle of democratic accountability. With uncompetitive seats/districts reducing the fear that incumbent politicians may lose office, they have less incentive to represent the interests of their constituents, even when those interests conform to majority support for an issue across the electorate as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Incumbent politicians may look out more for their party's interests than for those of their constituents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nGerrymandering can affect campaign costs for district elections. If districts become increasingly stretched out, candidates must pay increased costs for transportation and trying to develop and present [[campaign advertising]] across a district.{{Citation needed|reason=April 2008|date=April 2008}} The incumbent's advantage in securing campaign funds is another benefit of his or her having a gerrymandered secure seat.\n\n===Less descriptive representation===\nGerrymandering also has significant effects on the [[representation (politics)|representation]] received by voters in gerrymandered districts. Because gerrymandering can be designed to increase the number of wasted votes among the electorate, the relative representation of particular groups can be drastically altered from their actual share of the voting population. This effect can significantly prevent a gerrymandered system from achieving proportional and [[descriptive representation]], as the winners of elections are increasingly determined by who is drawing the districts rather than the preferences of the voters.\n\nGerrymandering may be advocated to improve representation within the legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups by packing them into a single district. This can be controversial, as it may lead to those groups' remaining marginalised in the government as they become confined to a single district. Candidates outside that district no longer need to represent them to win elections.\n\nAs an example, much of the redistricting conducted in the United States in the early 1990s involved the intentional creation of additional \"majority-minority\" districts where racial minorities such as African Americans were packed into the majority. This \"maximization policy\" drew support by both the Republican Party (who had limited support among African Americans and could concentrate their power elsewhere) and by minority representatives elected as Democrats from these constituencies, who then had safe seats. <!-- cite a famous politician or political scientist that has a good quote of this here -->\n\nThe 2012 election provides a number of examples as to how partisan gerrymandering can adversely affect the descriptive function of states' congressional delegations. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives received 83,000 more votes than Republican candidates, yet the Republican-controlled redistricting process in 2010 resulted in Democrats losing to their Republican counterparts in 13 out of Pennsylvania's 18 districts.<ref>Ting, Jan C. \"Boehner and House Republicans Lack Mandate to Oppose Obama.\" NewsWorks.

If only a Democratic landslide were needed, why wouldn't a majority vote do the trick? I think editor means \"landslide in the respective cities to offset the outlying vote.\"|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Incumbent gerrymandering===\nGerrymandering can also be done to help incumbents as a whole, effectively turning every district into a packed one and greatly reducing the potential for competitive elections. This is particularly likely to occur when the minority party has significant obstruction power\u2014unable to enact a partisan gerrymander, the legislature instead agrees on ensuring their own mutual reelection.\n\nIn an unusual occurrence in 2000, for example, the two dominant parties in the state of California [[Redistricting in California|cooperatively redrew]] both state and Federal legislative districts to preserve the status quo, ensuring the electoral safety of the politicians from unpredictable voting by the electorate. This move proved completely effective, as no State or Federal legislative office changed party in the [[U.S. House election, 2004|2004 election]], although 53 congressional, 20 state senate, and 80 state assembly seats were potentially at risk.\n\nIn 2006, the term \"70/30 District\" came to signify the equitable split of two evenly split (i.e. 50/50) districts. The resulting districts gave each party a guaranteed seat and retained their respective power base.\n\n===Prison-based gerrymandering===\nPrison-based gerrymandering occurs when prisoners are counted as residents of a particular district, increasing the district's population with non-voters when assigning political apportionment. This phenomenon violates the principle of [[one person, one vote]] because, although many prisoners come from (and return to) urban communities, they are counted as \"residents\" of the rural districts that contain large prisons, thereby artificially inflating the political representation in districts with prisons at the expense of voters in all other districts without prisons.<ref>{{cite news |title=Prison-Based Gerrymandering |url=http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2006/05/20/NYT-gerrymandering |newspaper=The New York Times |type=Editorial |date=20 May 2006}}</ref> Others contend that prisoners should not be counted as residents of their original districts when they do not reside there and are [[disenfranchisement|not legally eligible to vote]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Bill|first=Prison Policy|last=Initiative|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A11597.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Technical Amendment|first=Prison Policy|last=Initiative|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}</ref>\n\n==Changes to achieve competitive elections==\n[[File:map22007.gif|thumb|250px|Electoral divisions in the Sydney area, drawn by the politically independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]]]]\nDue to the perceived issues associated with gerrymandering and its effect on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice either more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies. In Spain, they are constitutionally fixed since 1978.<ref name=\"ES_Const\" />\n\nIn the United States, however, such reforms are controversial and frequently meet particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence.\n\n=== Redistricting by neutral or cross-party agency ===\nThe most commonly advocated electoral reform proposal targeted at gerrymandering is to change the redistricting process. Under these proposals, an independent and presumably objective commission is created specifically for redistricting, rather than having the legislature do it.\n\nThis is the system used in the United Kingdom, where the independent [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary commissions]] determine the boundaries for [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved legislatures]], subject to ratification by the body in question (almost always granted without debate). A similar situation exists in Australia where the independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]] and its state-based counterparts determine electoral boundaries for federal, state and local jurisdictions.\n\nTo help ensure neutrality, members of a redistricting agency may be appointed from relatively apolitical sources such as retired judges or longstanding members of the civil service, possibly with requirements for adequate representation among competing political parties. Additionally, members of the board can be denied access to information that might aid in gerrymandering, such as the demographic makeup or voting patterns of the population.\n\nAs a further constraint, [[consensus]] requirements can be imposed to ensure that the resulting district map reflects a wider perception of fairness, such as a requirement for a supermajority approval of the commission for any district proposal. Consensus requirements, however, can lead to deadlock, such as occurred in [[Missouri]] following the 2000 census. There, the equally numbered partisan appointees were unable to reach consensus in a reasonable time, and consequently the courts had to determine district lines.\n\nIn the U.S. state of [[Iowa]], the nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau (LSB, akin to the U.S. [[Congressional Research Service]]) determines boundaries of electoral districts. Aside from satisfying federally mandated contiguity and population equality criteria, the LSB mandates unity of counties and cities. Consideration of political factors such as location of incumbents, previous boundary locations, and political party proportions is specifically forbidden. Since Iowa's counties are chiefly regularly shaped [[polygons]], the LSB process has led to districts that follow county lines.<ref name=\"7_buck_trust.html\"/>\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] had a ballot measure to create an independent commission whose first priority was competitive districts, a sort of \"reverse gerrymander\". A complex mathematical formula was to be used to determine the competitiveness of a district. The measure failed voter approval chiefly due to voter concerns that communities of interest would be broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2005/11/08/oh/state/issue/4/ |title=Issue 4: Independent Redistricting Process \u2013 Ohio State Government |publisher=Smartvoter.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the [[Open Our Democracy Act of 2017]] was submitted to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] by [[John Delaney (Maryland politician)|Rep. Delaney]] as a means to implement non-partisan redistricting.\n\n===Transparency regulations===\nWhen a single political party controls both legislative houses of a state during redistricting, both Democrats and Republicans have displayed a marked propensity for couching the process in secrecy; in May 2010, for example, the Republican National Committee held a redistricting training session in Ohio where the theme was \"Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/12/13/study-of-gop-maps-points-to-politics.html|title= Study of GOP Maps Points to Politics|publisher= Dispatch.com|last1=Siegel|first1= Jim|date= 13 December 2011|access-date=5 March 2013}}</ref> The need for increased transparency in redistricting processes is clear; a 2012 investigation by The Center for Public Integrity reviewed every state's redistricting processes for both transparency and potential for public input, and ultimately assigned 24 states grades of either D or F.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kusnetz |first=Nicholas |date=1 November 2012 |title=Behind Closed Doors: GOP and Dems Alike Cloaked Redistricting in Secrecy |url=http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/01/14839356-behind-closed-doors-gop-and-dems-alike-cloaked-redistricting-in-secrecy?lite |work=NBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn response to these types of problems, redistricting transparency legislation has been introduced to US Congress a number of times in recent years, including the Redistricting Transparency Acts of 2010, 2011, and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr4918|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2010 (2010; 111th Congress H.R. 4918) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr419|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2011 (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 419) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr337|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2013 (2013; 113th Congress H.R. 337) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref> Such policy proposals aim to increase the transparency and responsiveness of the redistricting systems in the US. The merit of increasing transparency in redistricting processes is based largely on the premise that lawmakers would be less inclined to draw gerrymandered districts if they were forced to defend such districts in a public forum.\n\n===Changing the voting system===\nBecause gerrymandering relies on the [[wasted vote|wasted-vote effect]], the use of a different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of [[multimember district|multi-member districts]] alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as [[Single Transferable Voting|single transferable voting]] can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. Semi-proportional voting systems such as [[single non-transferable vote]] or [[cumulative voting]] are relatively simple and similar to ''first past the post'' and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering. Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.<ref>See, e.g., Richard L. Engstrom, The Single Transferable Vote: An Alternative Remedy for Minority Vote Dilution, 27 U.S.F.L.Rev. 781, 806 (1993) (arguing that the Single Transferable Voting systems maintain minority electoral opportunities); Steven J. Mulroy, Alternative Ways Out: A Remedial Road Map for the Use of Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Act Remedies, 77 N.C.L.Rev. 1867, 1923 (1999) (concluding that ranked-ballot voting systems avoid minority vote dilution); Steven J. Mulroy, The Way Out: A Legal Standard for Imposing Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Remedies, 33 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 333, 350 (1998) (arguing that preferential voting systems enhance minority representation); and Alexander Athan Yanos, Note, Reconciling the Right to Vote With the Voting Rights Act, 92 Colum.L.Rev. 1810, 1865\u201366 (1992) (arguing that Single Transferable Voting serves to preserve the minority party's right to representation).</ref>\n\nElectoral systems with various forms of proportional representation are now found in nearly all European countries, resulting in multi-party systems (with many parties represented in the parliaments) with higher voter attendance in the elections,<ref>{{Citation\n | title = Voter Turnout Rates from a Comparative Perspective\n | url = http://www.idea.int/publications/vt/upload/Voter%20turnout.pdf\n | last1 =  Pintor  | first1 =  Rafael L\u00f3pez\n | last2 =  Gratschew  | first2 =  Maria\n | last3 =  Sullivan  | first3 =  Kate\n | accessdate = 7 March 2014 }}</ref> fewer wasted votes, and a wider variety of political opinions represented.\n\nElectoral systems with election of just one winner in each district (i.e., \"winner-takes-all\" electoral systems) and no proportional distribution of extra mandates to smaller parties tend to create two-party systems ([[Duverger's law]]). In these, just two parties effectively compete in the national elections and thus the national political discussions are forced into a narrow two-party frame, where loyalty and forced statements inside the two parties distort the political debate.{{According to whom|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Changing the size of districts and the elected body===\nIf a proportional or semi-proportional voting system is used then increasing the number of winners in any given district will reduce the number of wasted votes. This can be accomplished both by merging separate districts together and by increasing the total size of the body to be elected. Since gerrymandering relies on exploiting the wasted vote effect, increasing the number of winners per district can reduce the potential for gerrymandering in proportional systems. Unless all districts are merged, however, this method cannot eliminate gerrymandering entirely.\n\nIn contrast to proportional methods, if a nonproportional voting system with multiple winners (such as [[plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]) is used, then increasing the size of the elected body while keeping the number of districts constant will not reduce the amount of wasted votes, leaving the potential for gerrymandering the same. While merging districts together under such a system can reduce the potential for gerrymandering, doing so also amplifies the tendency of block voting to produce [[landslide victory|landslide victories]], creating a similar effect to gerrymandering by concentrating wasted votes among the opposition and denying them representation.\n\nIf a system of single-winner elections is used, then increasing the size of the elected body will implicitly increase the number of districts to be created. This change can actually make gerrymandering easier when raising the number of single-winner elections, as opposition groups can be more efficiently packed into smaller districts without accidentally including supporters, further increasing the number of wasted votes amongst the opposition.\n\n===Using fixed districts===\nAnother way to avoid gerrymandering is simply to stop redistricting altogether and use existing political boundaries such as state, county, or provincial lines. While this prevents future gerrymandering, any existing advantage may become deeply ingrained. The [[United States Senate]], for instance, has more competitive elections than the House of Representatives due to the use of existing state borders rather than gerrymandered districts\u2014Senators are elected by their entire state, while Representatives are elected in legislatively drawn districts.\n\nThe use of fixed districts creates an additional problem, however, in that fixed districts do not take into account changes in population. Individual voters can come to have very different degrees of influence on the legislative process. This [[malapportionment]] can greatly affect representation after long periods of time or large population movements. In the United Kingdom during the [[Industrial Revolution]], several constituencies that had been fixed since they gained representation in the Parliament of England became so small that they could be won with only a handful of voters (''[[rotten borough]]s''). Similarly, in the U.S. the state legislature of Alabama refused to redistrict for more than 60 years, despite major changes in population patterns. By 1960 less than a quarter of the state's population controlled the majority of seats in the legislature.<ref>Dr. Michael McDonald, U.S. Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm Dept. of Public and International Affairs George Mason University]. Retrieved 6 April 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624024455/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm |date=24 June 2008 }}</ref> However, this practice of using fixed districts for state legislatures was effectively banned in the United States after the ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' Supreme Court decision in 1964, establishing a rule of [[one man, one vote]].\n\n===Objective rules to create districts===\nAnother means to reduce gerrymandering is to create objective, precise criteria to which any district map must comply. Courts in the United States, for instance, have ruled that congressional districts must be contiguous in order to be constitutional.<ref>[[s:Reynolds v. Sims|Reynolds v. Sims]] states that \"a state legislative apportionment scheme may properly give representation to various political subdivisions and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory if substantial equality among districts is maintained.\" See also [[Reynolds v. Sims|the Wikipedia article]].</ref> This, however, is not a particularly binding constraint, as very narrow strips of land with few or no voters in them may be used to connect separate regions for inclusion in one district, as is the case in [[Illinois's 4th congressional district]].\n\nDepending on the distribution of voters for a particular party, metrics that maximize compactness can be opposed to metrics that minimize the efficiency gap.  For example, in the United States, voters registered with the Democratic Party tend to be concentrated in cities, potentially resulting in a large number of \"wasted\" votes if compact districts are drawn around city populations.  Neither of these metrics take into consideration other possible goals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/|title=Hating Gerrymandering Is Easy. Fixing It Is Harder.|first=David|last=Wasserman|date=25 January 2018|website=fivethirtyeight.com}}</ref> such as proportional representation based on other demographic characteristics (such as race, ethnicity, gender, or income), maximizing competitiveness of elections (the greatest number of districts where party affiliation is 50/50), avoiding splits of existing government units (like cities and counties), and ensuring representation of major interest groups (like farmers or voters in a specific transportation corridor), though any of these could be incorporated into a more complicated metric.\n\n====Minimum district to convex polygon ratio====\nOne method is to define a minimum district to [[convex polygon]] ratio {{Definition needed|date=July 2016}} . To use this method, every proposed district is circumscribed by the smallest possible convex polygon (similar to the concept of a [[convex hull]]; think of stretching a rubberband around the outline of the district). Then, the area of the district is divided{{elucidate|date=December 2015}} by the area of the polygon; or, if at the edge of the state, by the portion of the area of the polygon within state boundaries.\n\nThe advantages of this method are that it allows a certain amount of human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of [[#Shortest splitline algorithm|splitline districting]]); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighbourhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.\n\n====Shortest splitline algorithm====\nThe [[Center for Range Voting]] has proposed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/GerryExamples.html |title=Gerrymandering and a cure\u2014shortest splitline algorithm |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> a way to draw districts by a simple [[algorithm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org|title=RangeVoting.org \u2013 Center for Range Voting}}</ref> The algorithm uses only the shape of the state, the number N of districts wanted, and the population distribution as inputs. The algorithm (slightly simplified) is:\n# Start with the boundary outline of the state.\n# Let N=A+B where N is the number of districts to create, and A and B are two whole numbers, either equal (if N is even) or differing by exactly one (if N is odd). For example, if N is 10, each of A and B would be 5. If N is 7, A would be 4 and B would be 3.\n# Among all possible straight lines that split the state into two parts with the population ratio A:B, choose the ''shortest''. If there are two or more such shortest lines, choose the one that is most north-south in direction; if there is still more than one possibility, choose the westernmost.\n# We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely A and B) of districts. Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.\n# Any human residence that is split in two or more parts by the resulting lines is considered to be a part of the most north-eastern of the resulting districts; if this doesn't decide it, then of the most northern.\nThis district-drawing algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, ultra-low cost, a single possible result (thus no possibility of human interference), lack of intentional bias, and it produces simple boundaries that do not meander needlessly. It has the disadvantage of ignoring geographic features such as rivers, cliffs, and highways and cultural features such as tribal boundaries. This landscape oversight causes it to produce districts different from those a human would produce. Ignoring geographic features can induce very simple boundaries.\n\nWhile most districts produced by the method will be fairly compact and either roughly rectangular or triangular, some of the resulting districts can still be long and narrow strips (or triangles) of land.\n\nLike most automatic redistricting rules, the shortest splitline algorithm will fail to create majority-minority districts, for both ethnic and political minorities, if the minority populations are not very compact. This might reduce minority representation.\n\nAnother criticism of the system is that splitline districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same agglomeration are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the splitline allocation of [[Colorado]].<ref>http://www.rangevoting.org/SSHR/co_final.png</ref>\n\nAs of July 2007, shortest-splitline redistricting pictures, based on the results of the 2000 census, are available for all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/SplitLR.html |title=Splitline districtings of all 50 states + DC + PR |publisher=RangeVoting.org |date= |accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Minimum isoperimetric quotient====\n{{See also|Compactness measure of a shape|Polsby-Popper Test}}\nIt is possible to define a specific minimum [[Isoperimetric inequality|isoperimetric quotient]],<ref name=\"siam.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/1237.pdf |title=James Case \"Flagrant Gerrymandering: Help from the Isoperimetric Theorem?\" |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref> proportional to the ratio between the area and the square of the perimeter of any given congressional voting district. Although technologies presently exist to define districts in this manner, there are no rules in place mandating their use, and no national movement to implement such a policy. One problem with the simplest version of this rule is that it would prevent incorporation of jagged natural boundaries, such as rivers or mountains; when such boundaries are required, such as at the edge of a state, certain districts may not be able to meet the required minima. One way of avoiding this problem is to allow districts which share a border with a state border to replace that border with a polygon or semi-circle enclosing the state boundary as a kind of virtual boundary definition, but using the actual perimeter of the district whenever this occurs inside the state boundaries. Enforcing a minimum isoperimetric quotient would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.<ref name=\"siam.org\"/>\n\n====Efficiency Gap calculation====\n{{see also|Wasted vote#Efficiency gap}}\nThe efficiency gap is a simply-calculable measure that can show the effects of gerrymandering.<ref name=The New Republic: \"Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All\">{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering |title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All |author=Nicholas Stephanopoulas |date= |accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> It measures wasted votes for each party: the sum of votes cast in losing districts (losses due to cracking) and excess votes cast in winning districts (losses due to packing).  The difference in these wasted votes are divided by total votes cast, and the resulting percentage is the efficiency gap.\n\n==Use of databases and computer technology==\n{{See also|Geographic information system}}\nThe introduction of modern computers alongside the development of elaborate [[voter database]]s and special districting software has made gerrymandering a far more precise science. Using such databases, political parties can obtain detailed information about every household including political party registration, previous campaign donations, and the number of times residents voted in previous elections and combine it with other predictors of voting behavior such as age, income, race, or education level. With this data, gerrymandering politicians can predict the voting behavior of each potential district with an astonishing degree of precision, leaving little chance for creating an accidentally competitive district.\n\nOn the other hand, the introduction of modern computers would let the United States Census Bureau to calculate more equal populations in every voting district that are based only on districts being the most compact and equal populations.  This could be done easily using their Block Centers based on the Global Positioning System rather than street addresses.  With this data, gerrymandering politicians will not be in charge, thus allowing competitive districts again.\n\nOnline web apps such as [[Dave's Redistricting]] have allowed any citizen to redistrict [[U.S. state|states]] into legislative districts as they wish <ref>{{cite web |last1=Bradlee |first1=Dave |title=Dave Bradlee |url=http://gardow.com/davebradlee/default.html |website=Gardow.com |accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Wang |first1=Sam |title=The Great Gerrymander of 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html?mtrref=gardow.com&gwh=153379BDD0BA3BC27970DD0557D184C2&gwt=pay&assetType=opinion |website=The New York Times |accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref> According to Bradlee, the software was designed to \"put power in people's hands,\" and so that they \"can see how the process works, so it's a little less mysterious than it was 10 years ago.\" <ref>{{cite web |last1=Korte |first1=Gregory |title=Technology allows citizens to be part of redistricting process |url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-03-21-redistricting21_ST_N.htm |website=USA Today |accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n==International examples of gerrymandering==\nAmong western democracies, only [[Israel]] and the [[Netherlands]] employ an electoral system with only one (nationwide) voting district for election of national representatives.

When [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] were admitted to Confederation in 1905, their original district boundaries were set forth in the respective [[Alberta Act|Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan Act]]s. These boundaries had been devised by federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members to ensure the election of provincial Liberal governments.\n\nSince responsibility for drawing federal and provincial electoral boundaries was handed over to independent agencies, this problem has largely been eliminated at these levels of government. [[Manitoba]] was the first province to authorise a non-partisan group to define constituency boundaries in the 1950s. In 1964, the federal government delegated the drawing of boundaries for national seats to the \"arm's length\" [[Elections Canada]].\n\nAs a result, gerrymandering is not generally a major issue in Canada except at the civic level. Although city wards are recommended by independent agencies, city councils occasionally overrule them. This is much more likely where the city is not homogenous and different neighbourhoods have sharply different opinions about city policy direction.\n\nIn 2006, a controversy arose in [[Prince Edward Island]] over the provincial government's decision to throw out an electoral map drawn by an independent commission. Instead they created two new maps. The government adopted the second of these, designed by the [[caucus]] of the governing party. Opposition parties and the media attacked Premier [[Pat Binns]] for what they saw as gerrymandering of districts. Among other things, the government adopted a map that ensured that every current [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from the premier's party had a district to run in for re-election, whereas in the original map, several had been redistricted.<ref>{{cite news |title=No Christmas election: Binns |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2006/11/16/binns-fall.html?ref=rss |work=[[cbc.ca]] |date=16 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090702191517/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2006/11/16/binns-fall.html?ref=rss |archive-date=2 July 2009}}</ref> Despite this, in the [[Prince Edward Island general election, 2007|2007 provincial election]] only seven of 20 incumbent Members of the Legislative Assembly were re-elected (seven did not run for re-election), and the government was defeated.\n\n===Chile===\n\nThe military government which ruled [[Chile]] from 1973 to 1990 was ousted in a [[Chilean national plebiscite, 1988|national plebiscite]] in October 1988. Opponents of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] voted NO to remove him from power and to trigger democratic elections, while supporters (mostly from the right-wing) voted YES to keep him in office for another eight years.\n\nFive months prior to the plebiscite, the regime published a law regulating future elections and referendums, but the configuration of electoral districts and the manner in which Congress seats would be awarded were only added to the law seven months after the referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30082&tipoVersion=0 |title=LEY-18700 06-MAY-1988 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=18799 |title=LEY-18799 26-MAY-1989 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house), [[Electoral division of Chile|60 districts]] were drawn by grouping (mostly) neighboring [[Communes of Chile|communes]] (the smallest administrative subdivision in the country) within the same [[Regions of Chile|region]] (the largest). It was established that two deputies would be elected per district, with the most voted coalition needing to outpoll its closest rival by a margin of more than 2-to-1 to take both seats. The results of the 1988 plebiscite show that neither the \"NO\" side nor the \"YES\" side outpolled the other by said margin in any of the newly established districts. They also showed that the vote/seat ratio was lower in districts which supported the \"YES\" side and higher in those where the \"NO\" was strongest.<ref>[http://flacsochile.org/biblioteca/pub/memoria/1989/000261.pdf Documento de trabajo.

The 1980 Constitution allocated a number of seats to appointed senators, making it harder for one side to change the Constitution by itself. The opposition won 22 senate seats in the 1989 election, taking both seats in three out of 19 constituencies, controlling 58% of the elected Senate, but only 47% of the full Senate. The unelected senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms, but the electoral map has remained largely untouched (two new regions were created in 2007, one of which altered the composition of two senatorial constituencies; the first election to be affected by this minor change took place in 2013).\n\n===France===\nFrance is one of the few countries to let legislatures redraw the map with no check.<ref>Balinski & Ba\u00efou (2002), ''D\u00e9coupage \u00e9lectoral'', Pour la science</ref> In practice, the legislature sets up an executive commission. Districts called ''arrondissements'' were used in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] and under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] they are called ''circonscriptions''. During the Third Republic, some reforms of arrondissements, which were also used for administrative purposes, were largely suspected to have been arranged to favour the kingmaker in the Assembly, the [[Parti radical]].\n\nThe dissolution of [[Seine (department)|Seine]] and [[Seine-et-Oise]] d\u00e9partements was seen as a case of Gerrymandering to counter communist's influence around Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://21maps.com/quand-la-politique-decoupe-la-geographie|title=Quand la politique d\u00e9coupe la g\u00e9ographie \u2022 21Maps|author=|date=15 March 2018|website=21maps.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the modern regime, there were three designs: in 1958 (regime change), 1987 (by [[Charles Pasqua]]) and 2010 (by [[Alain Marleix]]), three times by conservative governments. Pasqua's drawing was known to have been particularly good at gerrymandering, resulting in 80% of the seats with 58% of the vote in [[French legislative election, 1993|1993]], and forcing Socialists [[French legislative election, 1997|in the 1997 snap election]] to enact multiple pacts with smaller parties in order to win again, this time as a coalition. In 2010, the Sarkozy government created 12 districts for expats.\n\nThe [[Conseil Constitutionnel|Constitutional council]] was called twice by the opposition to decide about gerrymandering, but it never considered partisan disproportions. However, it forced the Marleix committee to respect an 80\u2013120% population ratio, ending a tradition dating back to the Revolution in which ''d\u00e9partements'', however small in population, would send at least two MPs.\n\nGerrymandering in France is also done against regionalist parties. ''D\u00e9partements'' are always used even if they split urban areas or larger identity territories, and smaller identity divisions are avoided.\n\n===Germany===\nWhen the electoral districts in Germany were redrawn in 2000, the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) was accused of gerrymandering to marginalise the left-wing [[Left Party (Germany)|PDS]] party. The SPD combined traditional PDS strongholds in eastern Berlin with new districts made up of more populous areas of western Berlin, where the PDS had very limited following.\n\nAfter having won four seats in Berlin in the 1998 national election, the PDS was able to retain only two seats altogether in the 2002 elections. Under German electoral law, a political party has to win either more than five percent of the votes, or at least three directly elected seats, to qualify for top-up seats under the [[Additional Member System]]. The PDS vote fell below five percent thus they failed to qualify for top-up seats and were confined to just two members of the [[Bundestag]], the German federal parliament (elected representatives are always allowed to hold their seats as individuals). Had they won a third constituency, the PDS would have gained at least 25 additional seats, which would have been enough to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the election of 2005, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (successor of the PDS) gained 8.7% of the votes and thus qualified for top-up seats.\n\n<!--Ugly paragraph and very confusing\u2014needs more explanation-->The number of Bundestag seats of parties which traditionally get over 5% of the votes cannot be affected very much by gerrymandering, because seats are awarded to these parties on a proportional basis. However, when a party wins so many districts in any one of the 16 federal states that those seats alone count for more than its proportional share of the vote in that same state does the districting have some influence on larger parties\u2014those extra seats, called \"[[Overhang seat|\u00dcberhangmandate]]\", remain. In the Bundestag election of 2009, Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU gained 24 such extra seats, while no other party gained any; this skewed the result so much that the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued two rulings declaring the existing election laws invalid and requiring the Bundestag to pass a new law limiting such extra seats to no more than 15. In 2013, Germany's Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of \u00dcberhangmandate, which from then on have to be added in proportion to the second vote of each party thereby making it impossible that one party can have more seats than earned by the proportionate votes in the election.\n\n===Greece===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}\nGerrymandering has been rather common in [[Greece|Greek]] history since organised parties with national ballots only appeared after the 1926 Constitution.{{clarify|reason=Why was it common if there were no parties? Also, why was there then only one case BEFORE it?|date=October 2013}} The only case before that was the creation of the Piraeus electoral district in 1906, in order to give the Theotokis party a safe district.\n\nThe most infamous case of gerrymandering{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} was in the [[Greek legislative election, 1956|1956 election]]. While in previous elections the districts were based on the [[prefecture]] level (\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2),{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for 1956 the country was split in districts of varying sizes, some being the size of prefectures, some the size of sub-prefectures (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) and others somewhere in between. In small districts the winning party would take all seats, in intermediate size it would take most and there was proportional representation in the largest districts. The districts were created in such a way that small districts were those that traditionally voted for the right while large districts were those that voted against the right.\n\nThis system has become known as the three-phase (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc) system or the [[baklava]] system (because, as baklava is split into full pieces and corner pieces, the country was also split into disproportionate pieces). The opposition, being composed of the center and the left, formed a coalition with the sole intent of changing the electoral law and then calling new elections, despite the fact that only seven years earlier the center and the left had fought each other in the [[Greek Civil War]]. Even though the centrist and leftist opposition won the popular vote (1,620,007 votes against 1,594,992), the right wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] won the majority of seats (165 to 135) and was to lead the country for the next two years.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn [[Hong Kong]], functional constituencies are demarcated by the government and defined in statutes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org|title=''Legislative Council Ordinance''|work=hklii.org}}</ref> making them prone to gerrymandering.

Successive arrangements by governments of all political characters have been attacked as gerrymandering. Ireland uses the [[single transferable vote]] and as well as the actual boundaries drawn the main tool of gerrymandering has been the number of seats per constituency used, with three-seat constituencies normally benefiting the strongest parties in an area, whereas four-seat constituencies normally help smaller parties.\n\nIn 1947 the rapid rise of new party [[Clann na Poblachta]] threatened the position of the governing party [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. The government of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] introduced the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947]], which increased the size of the D\u00e1il from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by the journalist and historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] as \"a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no [[Northern Ireland|Six County]] Unionist could have bettered.\"<ref name=\"coogan637\">Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993) hardback. page 637 {{ISBN|0-09-175030-X}}</ref> The following February the [[Irish general election, 1948|1948 general election]] was held and Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.<ref name=\"coogan637\" />\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Minister for Local Government, [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], attempted to arrange the constituencies to ensure that the governing [[Fine Gael]]\u2013[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|National Coalition]] would win a parliamentary majority. The [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]] was planned as a major reversal of previous gerrymandering by Fianna F\u00e1il (then in opposition). Tully ensured that there were as many as possible three-seat constituencies where the governing parties were strong, in the expectation that the governing parties would each win a seat in many constituencies, relegating Fianna F\u00e1il to one out of three.\n\nIn areas where the governing parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna F\u00e1il won a landslide victory in the [[Irish general election, 1977]], two out of three seats in many cases, relegating the National Coalition parties to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term \"[[Tullymandering]]\" was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.\n\n===Kuwait===\nFrom the years 1981 until 2005, Kuwait was divided into 25 electoral districts in order to over-represent the government's supporters (the 'tribes').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kias/pdf/kb4_1and2/08hiramatsu.pdf|title=The Changing Nature of the Parliamentary System in Kuwait|page=63 & 70|quote=Due to the gerrymandering on the part of the government, the \"tribes\" from the 1980s onwards, came to occupy a significant number of seats in the National Assembly.}}</ref> In July 2005, a new law for electoral reforms was approved which prevented electoral gerrymandering by cutting the number of electoral districts from 25 to 5. \nThe government of Kuwait found that 5 electoral districts resulted in a powerful parliament with the majority representing the opposition. A new law was crafted by the government of Kuwait and signed by the Amir to gerrymander the districts to 10 allowing the government's supporters to regain the majority.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{see also|List of Malaysian electoral districts}}\nThe practice of gerrymandering has been around in the country since its independence in 1957. The ruling coalition at that time, ''[[Barisan Nasional]]'' (BN; English: \"National Front\"), has been accused of controlling the election commission by revising the boundaries of constituencies. For example, during the [[Malaysian general election, 2013|13th General Election in 2013]], Barisan Nasional won 60% of the seats in the Malaysian Parliament despite only receiving 47% of the popular vote.<ref>{{cite news|date=9 August 2014|title=What's Malay for gerrymandering?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21611139-years-delineation-electoral-boundaries-will-determine-future-malaysian-politics-whats|newspaper=The Economist|location=Kuala Lumpur|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> Malapportionment has also been used at least since 1974, when it was observed that in one state alone (Perak), the parliamentary constituency with the most voters had more than ten times as many voters as the one with the fewest voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ongkianming.com/2013/07/19/press-statement-malaysia-among-the-most-malapportioned-countries-in-the-world/ |title=Malaysia among the most malapportioned countries in the world |last=Yang Berhomat Dr. Ong |first=Kiang Ming MP|date=2013-07-19 |accessdate=2016-02-19 }}</ref> These practices finally failed BN in the [[Malaysian general election, 2018|14th General Election]] on May 9, 2018, when the opposing ''[[Pakatan Harapan]]'' (PH; English: \"Alliance of Hope\") won despite perceived efforts of gerrymandering and malapportionment from the incumbent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/malaysia-election-results-details-who-won-2018-5/|title=In a historic election, Malaysia's allegedly corrupt prime minister lost to his 92-year-old former mentor who ran on behalf of a man he put in jail|date=2018-05-10|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Malta===\nThe Labour Party that won in 1981, even though the Nationalist Party got the most votes, did so because of its gerrymandering. A 1987 constitutional amendment prevented that situation from reoccurring.\n\n===Nepal===\nAfter the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali politics has well exercised the practice of gerrymandering with the view to take advantage in the election. It was often practised by [[Nepali Congress]], which remained in power in most of the time. Learning from this, the reshaping of constituency was done for constituent assembly and the opposition now wins elections.\n\n===Philippines===\n[[Legislative districts of the Philippines|Congressional districts in the Philippines]] were originally based on an ordinance from the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], which was created by the Constitutional Commission, which was ultimately based on legislative districts as they were drawn in 1907. The same constitution gave [[Congress of the Philippines]] the power to legislate new districts, either through a national redistricting bill or piecemeal redistricting per province or city. Congress has never passed a national redistricting bill since the approval of the 1987 constitution, while it has incrementally created 34 new districts, out of the 200 originally created in 1987.\n\nThis allows Congress to create new districts once a place reaches 250,000 inhabitants, the minimum required for its creation.

The County Council has twenty-two Protestants and eight Catholics.

This Council gives to the Unionists two to one majority on its Committees, and out of fifty-two officials employs only five Catholics. In [[County Antrim|Antrim]], which has the largest Protestant majority (196,000 to 40,000), twenty-six Unionists and three Catholics are returned.

This meant that both the Unionist and Nationalist parties were over-represented, while the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent politician|Independents]] (amounting to more than 35% of the votes cast) were severely under-represented.\n\nFrom the outset, Northern Ireland had installed the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system in order to secure fair elections in terms of proportional representation in its [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]]. After two elections under that system, [[House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929|in 1929]] Stormont changed the electoral system to be the same as the rest of the [[United Kingdom]]: a single-member [[first past the post]] system.

Most observers have acknowledged that the change to a single-winner system was a key factor, however, in stifling the growth of smaller political parties, such as the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent Unionist]]s.\n\nAfter Westminster reintroduced direct rule in 1973, it restored the single transferable vote (STV) for elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in the following year, using the same definitions of constituencies as for the Westminster Parliament. Currently in Northern Ireland, all elections use STV except those for positions in the [[Westminster Parliament]], which follow the pattern in the rest of the United Kingdom by using \"first past the post.\"\n\n====Boundary Review====\nThe number of electors in a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|United Kingdom constituency]] can vary considerably, with the smallest constituency currently (2017 electoral register) having fewer than a fifth of the electors of the largest (Scotland's Na h-Eileanan an Iar (21,769 constituents) and Orkney and Shetland (34,552), compared to England's North West Cambridgeshire (93,223) and Isle of Wight (110,697)). This variation has resulted from:\n* [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] being favoured in the Westminster Parliament with deliberately smaller electoral quotas (average electors per constituency) than those in [[England]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. This inequality was initiated by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958, which eliminated the previous common electoral quota for the whole United Kingdom and replaced it with four separate national quotas for the respective Boundaries commissions to work to: England 69,534; Northern Ireland 67,145, Wales 58,383 and in Scotland only 54,741 electors.\n* Current rules historically favouring geographically \"natural\"{{clarify|date=April 2014}} districts, this continues to give proportionally greater representation to Wales and Scotland.\n* Population migrations, due to [[white flight]] and [[deindustrialization]] tending to decrease the number of electors in inner-city districts.\n\nUnder the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], the [[Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition government]] planned to review and redraw the parliamentary constituency boundaries for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. The review and redistricting was to be carried out by the [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|four UK boundary commissions]] to produce a reduction from 650 to 600 seats, and more uniform sizes, such that a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] was to have no fewer than 70,583 and no more than 80,473 electors.

The Republican Party used its control of Congress to secure the admission of more states in territories friendly to their party\u2014the admission of [[Dakota Territory]] as two states instead of one being a notable example. By the rules for representation in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], each new state carried at least three electoral votes regardless of its population.<ref>Compare a map of the United States in 1860 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1860.jpg] with a map from 1870 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1870.jpg]. <!-- These images need to be put in wikimedia commons, rather than external links--></ref>\n\nAll redistricting in the United States has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. As a consequence of the decennial [[census]] required by the [[United States Constitution]], districts for members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] typically need to be redrawn. In many states, state legislatures have redrawn boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.\n\nState legislatures have used gerrymandering along racial lines both to decrease and increase minority representation in state governments and congressional delegations. In the state of Ohio, a conversation between Republican officials was recorded that demonstrated that redistricting was being done to aid their political candidates. Furthermore, the discussions assessed race of voters as a factor in redistricting, because African-Americans had backed Democratic candidates. Republicans apparently removed approximately 13,000 African American voters from the district of [[Jim Raussen]], a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, in an attempt to tip the scales in what was once a competitive district for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |title=Republican Party Politics (Part II) |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[WCPO]] |date=29 April 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112805/http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWith the Civil Rights Movement and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], federal enforcement and protections of suffrage for all citizens were enacted. Gerrymandering for the purpose of reducing the political influence of a racial or ethnic minority group was prohibited. After the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, some states created \"majority-minority\" districts to enhance minority voting strength. This practice, also called \"affirmative gerrymandering\", was supposed to redress historic discrimination and ensure that ethnic minorities would gain some seats and representation in government. In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Virginia, an incumbent protection plan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-virginia-an-incumbent-protection-plan/2013/09/27/0e08acfc-27c0-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=29 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nRather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan [[redistricting commission]]s.

The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742. The [[Gin Act 1751]] was more successful, however; it forced distillers to sell only to licensed retailers and brought gin shops under the jurisdiction of local magistrates.<ref name=\"nb\" /> Gin in the 18th century was produced in [[pot still]]s, and was somewhat sweeter than the London gin known today.\n\nIn London in the early 18th century, much gin was distilled legally in residential houses (there were estimated to be 1,500 residential stills in 1726) and was often flavoured with turpentine to generate resinous woody notes in addition to the juniper.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/history/0,6121,725676,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Distil my beating heart | date=1 June 2002|accessdate=3 May 2010}}</ref> As late as 1913, ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'' states without further comment, \"'common gin' is usually flavoured with turpentine\".<ref name=\"Gin definition\"/>\n\nAnother common variation was to distill in the presence of [[sulphuric acid]]. Although the acid itself does not distil, it imparts the additional aroma of [[diethyl ether]] to the resulting gin. Sulphuric acid subtracts one water molecule from two ethanol molecules to create [[diethyl ether]], which also forms an [[azeotrope]] with ethanol, and therefore distils with it. The result is a sweeter spirit, and one that may have possessed additional analgesic or even intoxicating effects&nbsp;\u2013 see [[Paracelsus]].\n\nDutch or Belgian gin, also known as ''[[jenever]]'' or ''genever'', evolved from malt wine spirits, and is a distinctly different drink from later styles of gin. [[Schiedam]], a city in the province of [[South Holland]], is famous for its ''jenever''-producing history. The same for [[Hasselt]] in the Belgian province of Limburg. The ''oude'' (old) style of ''jenever'' remained very popular throughout the 19th century, where it was referred to as ''Holland'' or ''Geneva'' gin in popular, American, pre-Prohibition bartender guides.<ref>Johnson, Harry; \"Harry Johnson's New and Improved Bartender's Manual; 1900.\";</ref>\n\nThe 18th century gave rise to a style of gin referred to as ''[[Old Tom gin]]'', which is a softer, sweeter style of gin, often containing sugar. Old Tom gin faded in popularity by the early 20th century.\n\n[[File:The Gin shop - Cruikshank, Scraps and sketches (1829), f.9 - BL.jpg|thumb|[[George Cruikshank]]'s engraving of The Gin Shop (1829)]]\nThe invention and development of the [[column still]] (1826 and 1831)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stillcooker.com/patent-still.php|title=Coffey still&nbsp;\u2013 Patent Still&nbsp;\u2013 Column Still: a continuous distillation|publisher=StillCooker & Friends|accessdate=29 March 2013}}</ref> made the distillation of neutral spirits practical, thus enabling the creation of the \"London dry\" style that evolved later in the 19th century.\n\nIn tropical British colonies gin was used to mask the bitter flavour of [[quinine]], which was the only effective anti-malarial compound.

Gin obtained simply by adding essences or flavourings to ethanol of agricultural origin is not distilled gin.\n;London gin\n:London gin is obtained exclusively from ethanol of agricultural origin with a maximum [[methanol]] content of 5&nbsp;grams per hectolitre of 100 per cent ABV equivalent, whose flavour is introduced exclusively through the re-distillation in traditional stills of ethanol in the presence of all the natural plant materials used, the resultant distillate of which is at least 70 per cent ABV. London gin may not contain added sweetening exceeding 0.1&nbsp;grams of sugars per litre of the final product, nor colourants, nor any added ingredients other than water. The term ''London gin'' may be supplemented by the term ''dry''.\n\nIn the EU, the minimum bottled alcoholic strength for gin, distilled gin, and London gin is 37.5 per cent ABV.\n\nIn the United States, gin is defined as an alcoholic beverage of no less than 40 per cent ABV (80 [[proof (alcohol)|proof]]) that possesses the characteristic flavour of juniper berries. Gin produced\nonly through distillation or redistillation of aromatics with an alcoholic wash can be further distinguished and marketed as \"distilled gin\".<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{citation |title=Definitions (\"Standards of Identity\") for Distilled Spirits, Title 27 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, Part 5, Section 5.22 ,(c) Class 3 |url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&rgn=div5&view=text&node=27:1.0.1.1.3&idno=27}}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Food and Drug Regulation recognizes gin with three different definitions (Genever, Gin, London or Dry gin) that loosely approximate the US definitions.

As a result of this evolution, gins can be broadly differentiated into three basic styles.<ref name=HAB>{{citation |title=Handbook of Alcoholic Beverages: Technical, Analytical and Nutritional Aspects |first=Alan J. |last=Buglass |chapter=3.4 |year=2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. |isbn=978-0-470-51202-9}}</ref>\n*'''Pot distilled gin''' represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from [[barley]] or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals to extract the aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A ''double gin'' can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due to the use of pot stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68 per cent ABV for a single distilled gin or 76 per cent ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. ''Korenwijn'' (grain wine) and the ''oude'' (old) style of ''Geneva gin'' or ''Holland gin'' represent the most prominent gins of this class.<ref name=HAB/>\n*'''Column distilled gin''' evolved following the invention of the [[Coffey still]], and is produced by first distilling high proof (e.g. 96 per cent ABV) [[Rectified spirit|neutral spirits]] from a fermented mash or wash using a refluxing still such as a [[Fractionating column|column still]]. The fermentable base for this spirit may be derived from grain, [[sugar beet]]s, [[grape]]s, [[potato]]es, [[sugar cane]], plain sugar, or any other material of agricultural origin. The highly concentrated spirit is then redistilled with juniper berries and other botanicals in a pot still. Most often, the botanicals are suspended in a \"gin basket\" positioned within the head of the still, which allows the hot alcoholic vapours to extract flavouring components from the botanical charge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homedistiller.org/equip/designs/gin|title=Home Distillation of Alcohol (Homemade Alcohol to Drink)|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}</ref> This method yields a gin lighter in flavour than the older pot still method, and results in either a ''distilled gin'' or ''London dry gin'',<ref name=HAB/> depending largely upon how the spirit is finished.\n*'''Compound gin''' is made by simply flavouring neutral spirits with essences or other \"[[Flavor#Regulations_on_natural_flavoring|natural flavourings]]\" without redistillation, and is not as highly regarded as distilled gin.<ref name=HAB/>\n\nPopular botanicals or flavouring agents for gin, besides the required juniper, often include citrus elements, such as lemon and [[bitter orange]] peel, as well as a combination of other spices, which may include any of [[anise]], [[angelica]] root and seed, [[orris root]], [[licorice]] root, [[cinnamon]], almond, [[cubeb]], [[Satureja|savory]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]] peel, [[grapefruit]] peel, dragon eye ([[longan]]), [[saffron]], [[baobab]], [[frankincense]], [[coriander]], [[Aframomum melegueta|grains of paradise]], [[nutmeg]], [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]] bark or others. The different combinations and concentrations of these botanicals in the distillation process cause the variations in taste among gin products.\n\nChemical research has begun to identify the various chemicals that are extracted in the distillation process and contribute to gin's flavouring. For example, juniper [[monoterpene]]s come from juniper berries. Citric flavours come from chemicals such as [[limonene]] and gamma-terpinene [[linalool]]. Spice-like flavours come from chemicals such as [[sabinene]], delta-3-carene, and para-cymene.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riu-Aumatell|first=M.|last2=Vichi|first2=S.|last3=Mora-Pons|first3=M.|last4=L\u00f3pez-Tamames|first4=E.|last5=Buxaderas|first5=S.|date=2008-08-01|title=Sensory Characterization of Dry Gins with Different Volatile Profiles|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00820.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Food Science|language=en|volume=73|issue=6|pages=S286\u2013S293|doi=10.1111/j.1750-3841.2008.00820.x|issn=1750-3841}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Canadian Food and Drug Regulation, gin is produced through redistillation of alcohol from [[Juniper_berry|juniper-berries]] or a mixture of more than one such redistilled food products. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._870/page-30.html#h-56|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Food and Drug Regulations|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|website=laws.justice.gc.ca}}</ref>\n\n== Classic gin cocktails ==\nA well known gin cocktail is the [[Martini (cocktail)|martini]], traditionally made with gin and [[vermouth|dry vermouth]].

In recent years \"Gall\u2013Peters\" seems to dominate.\n\n==Peters World Map==\n[[File:Peters projection, date line in Bering strait.svg|thumb|450px|The right and left borders of the Peters map are in the [[Bering Strait]], so all of Russia is displayed on the right side. \n{{legend|#00b400|Greenwich great circle}}\n{{legend|#c80000|Bering Strait great circle (traversing [[Florence]] in Italy, see [[Florence meridian]])}}]]\n{{Tissot_indicatrix_world_map_cyl_equal-area_proj_comparison.svg}}\nIn 1967, [[Arno Peters]], a German filmmaker, devised a map projection identical to Gall's orthographic projection and presented it in 1973 as a \"new invention\". He promoted it as a superior alternative to the [[Mercator projection]], which was suited to navigation but also used commonly in world maps. The Mercator projection increasingly inflates the sizes of regions according to their distance from the equator. This inflation results, for example, in a representation of [[Greenland]] that is larger than [[Africa]], which has a geographic area 14 times greater than Greenland's. Since much of the technologically underdeveloped world lies near the equator, these countries appear smaller on a Mercator and therefore, according to Peters, seem less significant.<ref name=\"Monmonier\"/>{{rp|155}} On Peters's projection, by contrast, areas of equal size on the globe are also equally sized on the map. By using his \"new\" projection, Peters argued that poorer, less powerful nations could be restored to their rightful proportions. This reasoning has been picked up by many educational and religious bodies, leading to adoption of the Gall\u2013Peters projection among some socially concerned groups, including Oxfam,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.oxfam.org.uk/education/resources/mapping_our_world/mapping_our_world/03-Findthatplace/findthatplace.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622043129/http://www.oxfam.org.uk/education/resources/mapping_our_world/mapping_our_world/03-Findthatplace/findthatplace.htm |archive-date=2010-06-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> [[National Council of Churches]],<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.ncccusa.org/news/01news13.html|title= Ncc Friendship Press' Peters Projection Map}}</ref> [[New Internationalist]] magazine,<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://www.newint.org/features/1983/05/01/flat/|title=  The New Flat Earth}}</ref> and the [[Mennonite Central Committee]].<ref name=\" Ncc Friendship Press' Peters Projection Map \">Ncc Friendship Press' Peters Projection Map</ref> However, Peters's choice of 45\u00b0&nbsp;N/S for the standard parallels means that the regions displayed with highest accuracy include Europe and the US, and not the tropics.\n\nPeters's original description of the projection for his map contained a geometric error that, taken literally, implies standard parallels of 46\u00b002\u2032&nbsp;N/S.

The preceding century had already witnessed many campaigns for new projections with little visible result. Just twenty years earlier, for example, Trystan Edwards described and promoted his own eponymous projection, disparaging the Mercator, and recommending his projection as ''the'' solution.<ref name=\"Edwards\">Edwards, Trystan (1953). ''A New Map of the World''. London: B.T. Batsford LTD.</ref> Peters's projection differed from Edwards's only in height-to-width ratio. More problematic, Peters's projection was identical to one that was already over a century old, though he probably did not realize it.<ref name=\"Monmonier\"/> That projection\u2014Gall's orthographic\u2014passed unnoticed when it was announced in 1855.\n\nBeyond the lack of novelty in the projection itself, the claims Peters made about the projection were also familiar to cartographers. Just as in the case of Peters, earlier projections generally were promoted as alternatives to the Mercator. Inappropriate use of the Mercator projection in world maps and the size disparities figuring prominently in Peters's arguments against the Mercator projection had been remarked upon for centuries and quite commonly in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Edwards\"/><ref name=\"Hinks\">Hinks, Arthur R.

He announced his map at a time when themes of social justice resonated strongly in academia and politics. Suggesting \"[[cartographic imperialism]]\", Peters found ready audiences. The campaign was bolstered by the claim that the Peters projection was the only \"area-correct\" map. Other claims included \"absolute angle conformality\", \"no extreme distortions of form\", and \"totally distance-factual\".<ref name=\"Bulletin\">(1977) ''The Bulletin'' 25 (17) pp. 126\u2013127.

In the ensuing years, however, it became clear that Peters and his map were no flash in the pan. By 1980 many cartographers had turned overtly hostile to his claims. In particular, Peters writes in ''The New Cartography'',\n\n{{quote|Philosophers, astronomers, historians, popes and mathematicians have all drawn global maps long before cartographers as such existed.

They have sought to render it topical by cosmetic corrections.\n\n... The European world concept, as the last expression of a subjective global view of primitive peoples, must give way to an objective global concept.\n\nThe cartographic profession is, by its retention of old precepts based on the Eurocentric global concept, incapable of developing this egalitarian world map which alone can demonstrate the parity of all peoples of the earth.<ref name=\"Peters\">Peters, Arno (1983).

Their most emphatic refutation of Peters's assertions was the long list of cartographers who, over the preceding century, had formally expressed frustration at publishers' overuse of the Mercator, as noted above.<ref name=\"Snyder157\"/> Many of those cartographers had already developed projections they explicitly promoted as alternatives to the Mercator, including the most influential American cartographers of the twentieth century: [[John Paul Goode]] ([[Goode homolosine projection]]), [[Erwin Raisz]] ([[Armadillo projection]]), and [[Arthur H. Robinson]] ([[Robinson projection]]). Hence the cartographic community viewed Peters's narrative as ahistorical and mean-spirited.\n\nThe two camps never made any real attempts toward reconciliation. The Peters camp largely ignored the protests of the cartographers. Peters maintained there should be \"one map for one world\"<ref name=\"ODT\">''Arno Peters: Radical Map, Remarkable Man''.

The 1980s saw a flurry of literature directed against the Peters phenomenon. Though Peters's map was not singled out, the controversy motivated the American Cartographic Association (now [[Cartography and Geographic Information Society]]) to produce a series of booklets (including ''Which Map Is Best''<ref name=\"ACA1986\"/>) designed to educate the public about map projections and distortion in maps.

He founded the International Submarine Band in 1966 and, after several months of delay, their debut album ''[[Safe at Home]]'' was released in 1968 (by which time the group had disbanded). Parsons joined The Byrds in early 1968, and played a pivotal role in the making of the seminal ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' album. After leaving the group in late 1968, Parsons and fellow Byrd [[Chris Hillman]] formed The Flying Burrito Brothers in 1969, releasing their debut, ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'', the same year. The album was well received but failed commercially. After a sloppy cross-country tour, they hastily recorded ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]''. Parsons was fired from the band before its release in early 1970. He soon signed with [[A&M Records]], but after several unproductive sessions he canceled his intended solo debut in early 1971. Parsons moved to France, where he lived for a short period at [[Villa Nellc\u00f4te]] with his friend [[Keith Richards]] of [[The Rolling Stones]]. Returning to America, Parsons met [[Emmylou Harris]] through his friend and former bandmate [[Chris Hillman]]. She assisted him on vocals for his first solo record, ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'', released in 1973. Although it received enthusiastic reviews, the release failed to chart. His next album, ''[[Grievous Angel]]'', met with a similar reception, and peaked at number 195 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart. His health deteriorated under several years of drug abuse, and he died in 1973 at the age of 26.\n\nSince his death, Parsons has been credited with helping to found both [[country rock]] and [[alt-country]]. He did not consider his work \"country rock\" because he felt it should not be categorized in a single genre because it was a unique blend of many genres and styles of music with his own personal twang.<ref name=\"Allmusic Parsons\"/>\n\nHis posthumous honors include the [[Americana Music Association]] \"President's Award\" for 2003, and a ranking at No.&nbsp;87 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of the \"100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\"{{sfn|Rolling Stone|2005}}\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early years (1946\u201367)===\nIngram Cecil Connor III was born on November 5, 1946, in [[Winter Haven, Florida]], to Ingram Cecil \"Coon Dog\" (1917\u20131959) and Avis (n\u00e9e Snively) Connor (1923\u20131965).{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}} The Connors normally resided at their main residence in [[Waycross, Georgia|Waycross]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], but Avis traveled to her hometown in Florida to give birth.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|p=27}} She was the daughter of citrus fruit magnate [[John A.

For a time, the family found a stability of sorts. They were torn apart in early 1965, when Robert became embroiled in an [[extramarital sex|extramarital affair]] and Avis' heavy drinking led to her death from [[cirrhosis]] on June 5, 1965, the day of Gram's graduation from Bolles.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=139-143}}\n\nAs his family disintegrated around him, Parsons developed strong musical interests, particularly after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] perform in concert on February 22, 1956, in Waycross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvispresleymusic.com.au/elvis_presley_1956.html |title=Elvis Presley 1956 : The King of Rock 'n' Roll |website=Elvispresleymusic.com.au |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref> Five years later, while barely in his teens, he played in [[rock and roll]] cover bands such as the Pacers and the Legends, headlining in clubs owned by his stepfather in the Winter Haven/Polk County area.

Although he claimed to have studied theology (an oblique reference to his close friendship with his residential tutor, [[Harvard Divinity School]] graduate student Jet Thomas) in subsequent interviews, Parsons seldom attended his general education courses before departing in early 1966 after one semester. He did not become seriously interested in [[country music]] until his time at Harvard, where he heard [[Merle Haggard]] for the first time. \n\nIn 1966, he and other musicians from the Boston folk scene formed a group called the [[International Submarine Band]].

Their 1969 album ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'' marked the culmination of Parsons' post-1966 musical vision: a modernized variant of the [[Bakersfield sound]] that was popularized by [[Buck Owens]] amalgamated with strands of soul and [[psychedelic rock]]. The band appeared on the album cover wearing [[Nudie Cohn|Nudie]] suits emblazoned with all sorts of hippie accoutrements, including [[marijuana]], [[Tuinal]] and [[Seconal]]-inspired patches on Parsons' suit. Along with the Parsons-Hillman originals \"Christine's Tune\" and \"Sin City\" were versions of the [[soul music]] classics \"[[The Dark End of the Street]]\" and \"Do Right Woman\", the latter featuring [[David Crosby]] on high harmony. The album's original songs were the result of a very productive songwriting partnership between Parsons and Hillman, who were sharing a bachelor pad in the [[San Fernando Valley]] during this period. The atypically pronounced (for Parsons) gospel-soul influence on this album likely evolved from the ecumenical tastes of bassist [[Chris Ethridge]] (who co-wrote \"Hot Burrito No. 1 [I'm Your Toy]\" and \"Hot Burrito No. 2\" with Parsons) and frequent jamming with [[Delaney & Bonnie]] and Richards during the album's gestation.\n\nOriginal drummer [[Eddie Hoh]] (best known for his work with [[The Monkees]] and [[Al Kooper]]) proved to be unable to perform adequate takes due to an incipient substance abuse problem and was dismissed after two songs, leading the group to record the remainder of the album with a variety of session drummers, including former International Submarine Band drummer Jon Corneal (who briefly joined the group as an official member, appearing on a plurality of the tracks) and Popeye Phillips of [[Dr. Hook & the Medicine Show]]. Before commencing live performances, the group ultimately settled upon original Byrds drummer [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]]. Technically maladroit in comparison to his predecessors, Clarke's striking physical appearance proved to be the primary criterion in this decision; an associate of the band would later recall that \"the Burritos had to be pretty\" and \"Corneal didn't fit\" from that standpoint.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GuCVAcHgnOYC&pg=PA434&dq=twenty+thousand+roads+gram+parsons&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjPysT-vbnSAhUhyoMKHbV3AQcQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=clarke&f=false|title=Twenty Thousand Roads: The Ballad of Gram Parsons and His Cosmic American Music|first=David|last=Meyer|date=29 January 2008|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|accessdate=19 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nWhile unsuccessful from a commercial standpoint, the album was measured by [[rock critic]] [[Robert Christgau]] as \"an ominous, obsessive, tongue-in-cheek country-rock synthesis, absorbing rural and urban, traditional and contemporary, at point of impact.\" Embarking on a cross-country tour via train, as Parsons suffered from periodic bouts of fear of flying, the group squandered most of their money in a perpetual poker game and received bewildered reactions in most cities. Parsons was frequently indulging in massive quantities of [[psilocybin]] and [[cocaine]], so his performances were erratic at best, while much of the band's repertoire consisted of vintage [[honky-tonk]] and soul standards with few originals. Perhaps the most successful appearance occurred in Philadelphia, where the group opened for the reconstituted Byrds. Midway through their set, Parsons joined the headline act and fronted his former group on renditions of \"Hickory Wind\" and \"You Don't Miss Your Water\". The other Burritos surfaced with the exception of Clarke, and the joint aggregation played several songs, including \"[[Long Black Veil]]\" and \"Goin' Back\".\n\nAfter returning to Los Angeles, the group recorded \"The Train Song\", written during an increasingly infrequent songwriting session on the train and produced by 1950s R&B legends [[Larry Williams]] and [[Johnny \"Guitar\" Watson]]. Despite a request from the Burritos that the remnants of their publicity budget be diverted to promotion of the single, it also flopped. During this period, Ethridge realized that he did not share Parsons' and Hillman's affinity for country music, precipitating his departure shortly thereafter. He was replaced by lead guitarist [[Bernie Leadon]], while Hillman reverted to bass.\n\nBy this time, Parsons's own [[recreational drug use|use of drugs]] had increased so much that new songs were rare and much of his time was diverted to partying with the Stones, who briefly relocated to America in the summer of 1969 to finish their forthcoming ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' album and prepare for an autumn cross-country tour, their first series of regular live engagements in over two years. As they prepared to play the nation's largest basketball arenas and early stadium concerts, the Burritos played to dwindling nightclub audiences; on one occasion, Jagger had to beseech Parsons to fulfill an obligation to his group. As Parsons \"became a trust-fund baby when he came of age,\" he was still receiving about $30,000 per year (equivalent to $210,000 in 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=30%2C000&year1=196901&year2=201803|title=CPI Inflation Calculator|website=Data.bls.gov|accessdate=21 April 2018}}</ref> from his family trust during this period, \"distinguishing him from his many hungry, hard-scrabble peers.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/literature/2012-11-04/story/gram-parsons-biography-well-done/|title=Gram Parsons Biography Well Done|newspaper=[[The Florida Times-Union]]|accessdate=6 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the singer's dedication to the Rolling Stones was rewarded when the Burrito Brothers were booked as one of the acts at the infamous [[Altamont Music Festival]]. Playing a short set including \"Six Days on the Road\" and \"Bony Moronie\", Parsons left on one of the final helicopters and attempted to seduce [[Michelle Phillips]]. \"Six Days...\" was included in ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'', a documentary of the event.\n\nWith mounting debt incurred, A&M hoped to recoup some of their losses by marketing the Burritos as a straight country group. To this end, manager Jim Dickson instigated a loose session where the band recorded several honky tonk staples from their live act, contemporary pop covers in a countrified vein (\"To Love Somebody\", \"Lodi\", \"I Shall Be Released\", \"Honky Tonk Women\"), and Larry Williams' \"Bony Moronie\". This was soon scrapped in favor of a second album of originals on an extremely reduced budget.\n\nFaced with a dearth of new material, most of the album was hastily written in the studio by Leadon, Hillman, and Parsons, with two ''Gilded Palace of Sin'' outtakes thrown into the mix. The resulting album, entitled ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]'', was released in April 1970. Although it is considered less inspired than its predecessor, it is notable for the Parsons-Hillman-Leadon song \"Older Guys\" and for its take on Jagger and Richards' \"Wild Horses\", the first recording released of this famous song. Parsons was inspired to cover the song after hearing an advance tape of the ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' track sent to Kleinow, who was scheduled to overdub a pedal steel part; although Kleinow's part was not included on the released Rolling Stones version, it is available on bootlegs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJ5KTXbXoJo|title=The Rolling Stones: Wild Horses (Alternate Sticky Fingers Version with Gram Parsons)|first=|last=entarctica|date=9 May 2011|accessdate=19 December 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Ultimately\u2014and to the chagrin of Hillman, who was not keen on the song amid the band's creative malaise\u2014Jagger and Richards consented to the [[cover version]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tSy9OPq-XD0C&pg=PP112&dq=wild+horses+burrito+brothers&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiiy_2_zozSAhUJ7yYKHeR3Aw0Q6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=wild+horses+burrito+brothers&f=false|title=Flying Burrito Brothers' The Gilded Palace of Sin|first=Bob|last=Proehl|date=15 December 2008|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA|accessdate=19 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Burrito Deluxe'' underperformed commercially but also failed to carry the critical cachet of the debut. Disenchanted with the band, Parsons left the Burritos in mutual agreement with Hillman, who was long fatigued by his friend's unprofessionalism. Under Hillman's direction, the group recorded one more studio album before dissolving in the autumn of 1971.\n\nIn a recent interview with ''[[American Songwriter]]'' Chris Hillman explained that \"[t]he greatest legacy of the Flying Burrito Brothers and Gram is we were the alternative country band. We couldn't get on country radio and we couldn't get on rock radio! We were the outlaw country band for a brief period.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/|title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons|publisher=[[American Songwriter]]|accessdate=4 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Solo career and touring with Emmylou Harris (1970\u201373)===\nParsons signed a solo deal with A&M Records and moved in with producer [[Terry Melcher]] in early 1970.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=337-342}} Melcher, who had worked with The Byrds and [[The Beach Boys]] and had rejected producing unknown singer-songwriter [[Charles Manson]], was a member of the successful duo [[Bruce & Terry]], also known as The Rip Chords. The two shared a mutual penchant for cocaine and heroin, and as a result, the sessions were largely unproductive, with Parsons eventually losing interest in the project. \"Terry loved Gram and wanted to produce him ... But neither of them could get anything done,\" recalled writer and mutual friend [[Eve Babitz]].{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340}} \"Long lost, the tapes from this session have gathered a legendary patina,\" writes David Meyer.{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=341}} The recording stalled, and the master tapes were checked out, but there is conflict as to whether \"Gram ... or Melcher took them\".{{sfn|Meyer|2007|pp=340-341}}\n\nHe then accompanied the Rolling Stones on their [[The Rolling Stones UK Tour 1971|1971 U.K. tour]] in the hope of being signed to the newly formed [[Rolling Stones Records]]; by this juncture, Parsons and Richards had mulled the possibility of recording a duo album. Moving into [[Villa Nellc\u00f4te]] with the guitarist during the sessions for ''[[Exile on Main St.|Exile on Main Street]]'' that commenced thereafter, Parsons remained in a consistently incapacitated state and frequently quarreled with his much younger girlfriend, aspiring actress Gretchen Burrell. Eventually, Parsons was asked to leave by [[Anita Pallenberg]], Richards' longtime domestic partner. Decades later, Richards suggested in his memoir that Jagger may have been the impetus for Parsons' departure because Richards was spending so much time playing music with Parsons. Rumors have persisted that he appears somewhere on the legendary album, and while Richards concedes that it is very likely he is among the chorus of singers on \"Sweet Virginia\", this has never been substantiated. Parsons attempted to rekindle his relationship with the band on their [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1972|1972 American tour]] to no avail.\n\nAfter leaving the Stones' camp, Parsons married Burrell in 1971 at his stepfather's New Orleans estate. Allegedly, the relationship was far from stable, with Burrell cutting a needy and jealous figure while Parsons quashed her burgeoning film career. Many of the singer's closest associates and friends claim that Parsons was preparing to commence divorce proceedings at the time of his death; the couple had already separated by this point.\n\n[[File:Gram Parsons.jpg|Parsons in 1972|thumb]]\nParsons and Burrell enjoyed the most idyllic time of their relationship in the second half of 1971, visiting old cohorts like Ian Dunlop and [[Family (band)|Family]]/[[Blind Faith]]/[[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] member [[Ric Grech]] in England. With the assistance of Grech and one of the bassist's friends, a doctor who also dabbled in country music and is now known as [[Hank Wangford]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview with Hank Wangford |publisher=The Gram Parsons Project |url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm |accessdate=2011-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005060128/http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/hank/index.htm |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}</ref> Parsons eventually stopped taking heroin; a previous treatment suggested by [[William Burroughs]] proved unsuccessful.\n\nHe returned to the US for a one-off concert with the Burritos, and at Hillman's request went to hear [[Emmylou Harris]] sing in a small club in [[Washington, D.C.]] They befriended each other and, within a year, he asked her to join him in Los Angeles for another attempt to record his first solo album. It came as a surprise to many when Parsons was enthusiastically signed to [[Reprise Records]] by [[Mo Ostin]] in mid-1972. The ensuing ''[[GP (album)|GP]]'' (1973) featured several members of [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[TCB Band]], led by lead guitarist [[James Burton]]. It included six new songs from a creatively revitalized Parsons alongside several country covers, including [[Tompall Glaser]]'s \"[[Streets of Baltimore]]\" and [[George Jones]]' \"[[That's All It Took]]\".\n\nParsons, by now featuring Harris as his duet partner, toured across the United States as Gram Parsons and the Fallen Angels in February-March 1973. Unable to afford the services of the TCB Band for a month, the group featured the talents of Colorado-based rock guitarist [[Jock Bartley]] (soon to skyrocket to fame with [[Firefall]]), veteran Nashville session musician [[Neil Flanz]] on pedal steel, eclectic bassist Kyle Tullis (best known for his work with [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Larry Coryell]]) and former [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] drummer [[N.D. Smart]]. The touring party also included Gretchen Parsons\u2014by this point extremely envious of Harris\u2014and Harris' young daughter. Coordinating the spectacle as road manager was [[Phil Kaufman (producer)|Phil Kaufman]], who had served time with [[Charles Manson]] on [[Terminal Island]] in the mid-sixties and first met Parsons while working for the Stones in 1968. Kaufman ensured that the performer stayed away from substance abuse, limiting his [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] intake during shows and throwing out any drugs smuggled into hotel rooms. At first, the band was under-rehearsed and played poorly; however, they improved markedly with steady gigging and received rapturous responses at several leading countercultural venues, including [[Armadillo World Headquarters]] in [[Austin, Texas]], [[Max's Kansas City]] in New York City, and [[Liberty Hall (Houston, Texas)|Liberty Hall]] in [[Houston, Texas]] (where [[Neil Young]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] sat in for a filmed performance). According to a number of sources, it was Harris who forced the band to practice and work up an actual set list. Nevertheless, the tour failed to galvanize sales of ''GP'', which never charted in the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/search/artists/gram+parsons|title=Artist Search for \"gram parsons\"|website=AllMusic|accessdate=19 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nFor his next and final album, 1974's posthumously released ''[[Grievous Angel]]'', he again used Harris and members of the TCB Band for the sessions. The record received even more enthusiastic reviews than had ''GP'', and has since attained classic status. Its most celebrated song is a Parsons-Harris duet cover of \"[[Love Hurts]],\" a song that remains in Harris' solo repertoire. Notable Parsons-penned songs included \"$1000 Wedding,\" a holdover from the Burrito Brothers era, and \"Brass Buttons,\" a 1965 opus that addressed his mother's alcoholism. A new version of \"Hickory Wind\" was included, while \"Ooh Las Vegas,\" co-written with Grech, dated from the ''GP'' sessions. Despite the fact that Parsons only contributed two new songs to the album (\"In My Hour of Darkness\" and \"Return of the Grievous Angel\"), he was highly enthused with his new sound and seemed to have finally adopted a diligent mindset to his musical career, limiting his intake of alcohol and opiates during most of the sessions.\n\nBefore recording, Parsons and Harris played a preliminary four-show mini-tour as the headline act in a June 1973 Warner Brothers country rock package with the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|New Kentucky Colonels]] and [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]]. A shared backing band included former Byrds lead guitarist and Kentucky Colonel [[Clarence White]], Pete Kleinow and Chris Etheridge. On July 14, 1973, White was killed by a drunk driver in [[Palmdale, California]] while loading equipment in his car for a concert with the New Kentucky Colonels. At White's funeral, Parsons and Bernie Leadon launched into an impromptu touching rendition of \"[[Farther Along (song)|Farther Along]]\"; that evening, Parsons reportedly informed Phil Kaufman of his final wish: to be cremated in Joshua Tree. Despite the almost insurmountable setback, Parsons, Harris, and the other musicians decided to continue with plans for a fall tour.\n\nIn the summer of 1973, Parsons' [[Topanga Canyon]] home burned to the ground, the result of a stray cigarette. Nearly all of his possessions were destroyed with the exception of a guitar and a prized [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] automobile. The fire proved to be the last straw in the relationship between Burrell and Parsons, who moved into a spare room in Kaufman's house. While not recording, he frequently hung out and jammed with members of New Jersey\u2013based country rockers [[Quacky Duck and His Barnyard Friends]] and the [[proto-punk]] [[Jonathan Richman]] & the Modern Lovers, who were represented by former Byrds manager Eddie Tickner.\n\nBefore formally breaking up with Burrell, Parsons already had a woman waiting in the wings. While recording, he saw a photo of a beautiful woman at a friend's home and was instantly smitten. The woman turned out to be Margaret Fisher, a high school sweetheart of the singer from his Waycross, Georgia days. Like Parsons, Fisher had drifted west and became established in the Bay Area rock scene. A meeting was arranged and the two instantly rekindled their relationship, with Fisher dividing her weeks between Los Angeles and San Francisco at Parsons' expense.\n\n===Death===\n{{Main article|Death of Gram Parsons}}\nIn the late 1960s, Parsons became enamored of and began to vacation at [[Joshua Tree National Monument]] in southeastern [[California]], where he frequently partook in [[psychedelics]] and reportedly experienced several [[UFO sightings]]. After splitting from Burrell, Parsons often spent his weekends in the area with Margaret Fisher and Phil Kaufman, with whom he had been living. Scheduled to resume touring in October 1973, Parsons decided to go on another recuperative excursion on September 17. Accompanying him were Fisher, personal assistant Michael Martin, and Dale McElroy, Martin's girlfriend. Kaufman later declared that Parsons' attorney was preparing divorce papers for him to serve to Burrell while the singer remained in Joshua Tree on September 20.{{sfn|Meyer, David|p=416|2008}}\n\nDuring the trip, Parsons often retreated to the desert, while the group visited bars in the nearby hamlet of [[Yucca Valley, California]] on both nights of their stay. Parsons consumed alcohol and [[barbiturate]]s in high amounts. On September 18, Martin drove back to Los Angeles to resupply the group with marijuana. That night, after challenging Fisher and McElroy to drink with him (Fisher didn't like alcohol and McElroy was recovering from a bout of [[hepatitis C]]), he said, \"I'll drink for the three of us,\" and proceeded to drink six double tequilas. They then returned to the Joshua Tree Inn, where Parsons purchased [[morphine]] from an unknown young woman. After being injected by her in room #8, he overdosed. Fisher gave Parsons an ice-cube [[suppository]], and later on a cold shower. Instead of moving Parsons around the room, she put him to bed and went out to buy [[coffee]] in the hope of reviving him, leaving McElroy to stand watch. As his respiration became irregular and later ceased, McElroy attempted [[CPR|resuscitation]]. Her efforts failed and Fisher, watching from outside, was visibly alarmed. After further failed attempts, they decided to call an ambulance. Parsons was declared dead on his arrival at High Desert Memorial Hospital at 12:15 a.m. on September 19, 1973 in Yucca Valley. The official cause of death was an overdose of morphine and alcohol.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bMBf3TYZigQC&pg=PT83&dq=%22Gram+Parsons%22+death+OR+dead+OR+died&cd=2#v=onepage&q=%22Gram+Parsons%22+death+OR+dead+OR+died&f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|first=Jeremy|last=Simmonds|page=83|date=19 December 2017|publisher=Chicago Review Press|accessdate=19 December 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref name=\"dope\">[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a5_014.html \"What's up with the strange end of country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons?\"], ''[[The Straight Dope]]''; accessed September 24, 2017.</ref>\n\nAccording to Fisher in the 2005 biography ''Grievous Angel: An Intimate Biography of Gram Parsons,'' the amount of morphine consumed by Parsons would be lethal to three regular users; thus, he had likely overestimated his tolerance in light of his diminished intake despite his extensive experience with opiates. [[Keith Richards]] stated in the 2004 [[documentary film]] ''Fallen Angel'' that Parsons understood the danger of combining opiates and alcohol and should have known better. Upon Parsons' death, Fisher and McElroy were returned to Los Angeles by Kaufman, who dispersed the remnants of Parsons' drugs in the desert.\n\nBefore his death, Parsons stated that he wanted his body cremated at Joshua Tree and his ashes spread over Cap Rock, a prominent natural feature there; however, Parsons' stepfather Bob organized a private ceremony back in New Orleans and neglected to invite any of his friends from the music industry.<ref name=\"dope\"/> Two accounts state that Bob Parsons stood to inherit Gram's share of his grandfather's estate if he could prove that Gram was a resident of Louisiana, explaining his eagerness to have him buried there.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Strange Death of Gram Parsons: 1973 |publisher=ByrdWatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles |url=http://www.ebni.com/byrds/memgrp6.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990420141112/http://ebni.com/byrds/memgrp6.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 April 1999 |accessdate=25 March 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gramparsonsproject.com/ |title=Gram Parsons Project, interview with Phil Kaufman |website=Gramparsonsproject.com |accessdate=2012-06-07}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gram Parsons Memorial.jpg|thumb|Parsons' makeshift memorial in [[Joshua Tree, California]]]]\nTo fulfill Parsons' funeral wishes, Kaufman and a friend stole his body from [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and in a borrowed hearse, they drove it to Joshua Tree.

In 2006, the Gandulf Hennig-directed documentary film titled ''Gram Parsons: Fallen Angel'' was released.\n\n[[Emmylou Harris]] has continued to champion Parsons' work throughout her career, covering a number of his songs over the years, including \"Hickory Wind\", \"Wheels\", \"Sin City\", \"Luxury Liner\", and \"Hot Burrito No.&nbsp;2\".

The show featured tunes written by Gram Parsons and [[Gene Clark]] as well as influential songs and musical styles from other artists that were part of that era. Performers were also encouraged to showcase their own material. The underlying theme of the event is to inspire the performers to take these musical styles to the next level of the creative process. Past concerts have featured such notable artists as [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], [[Chris Ethridge]], [[Spooner Oldham]], [[John Molo]], Jack Royerton, [[Gib Guilbeau]], [[Counting Crows]], Bob Warford, [[Rosie Flores]], [[David Lowery (musician)|David Lowery]], [[Barry and Holly Tashian]], George Tomsco, [[Jann Browne]], [[Lucinda Williams]], Polly Parsons, The \"Road Mangler\" Phil Kaufman, [[Ben Fong-Torres]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[Mark Olson (musician)|Mark Olson]], and [[Sid Griffin]], as well as a variety of many other bands that had played over the two or three day event. In addition, the Gram Parsons Tribute, in Waycross, Georgia, is a music festival remembering Parsons in the town in which he grew up. Additional tributes spring up every year, the latest being the Southern California \"Gram On!\" celebration by The Rickenbastards in July, 2013, celebrating the life and legacy of a simple country boy with a dream, Gram Parsons.\n\nIn February 2008, Gram's prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, [[Emmylou Harris]], was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. Despite his influence, however, Parsons has yet to be inducted. [[Radley Balko]] has written that \"Parsons may be the most influential artist yet to be inducted to either the Rock and Roll or Country Music Hall(s) of Fame.

The high speed of such craft enabled them to avoid interception by the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. More recently the term \"'''cigarette boat'''\" has replaced the term \"'''rum-runner'''\". The present era of cigarette boats, dating from the 1960s, owes much of their design to boats designed for [[offshore powerboat racing]], particularly by designer and builder [[Donald Aronow]]. During this period, these boats were used by drug smugglers to transfer drugs across the [[Caribbean]] to the United States.\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:USN sailors run a suped-up modified cigarette boat at full speed through narrow river channels.jpg|right|thumb|[[US Navy SEALs]] train with a modified go-fast boat during a training exercise in Mississippi]]\nA typical go-fast is [[Fiberglass#Construction methods |laid-up]] using a combination of [[fiberglass]], [[kevlar]] and [[carbon fiber]], using a deep \"<tt>V</tt>\" style offshore racing hull ranging from 20 to 50 feet (6 to 15 m) long, narrow in beam, and equipped with two or more powerful engines, often with more than 1000 combined [[horsepower]].  The boats can typically travel at speeds over 80 [[knot (unit)|knots]] (150&nbsp;km/h, 90&nbsp;mph) in calm waters, over 50 knots (90&nbsp;km/h) in choppy waters, and maintain 25 knots (47&nbsp;km/h) in the average five to seven foot (1.5 to 2 m) [[Caribbean]] seas. They are heavy enough to cut through higher waves, although slower.\n\n==Use==\nReflecting their racing heritage, accommodations on these five-passengers-or-fewer boats are minimal.  A small low cabin under the foredeck is typical, much smaller than a typical motor yacht of similar size.  In addition to racing, most buyers buy these boats for their mystique, immense power, high top speeds, and sleek shape.\n\n==Illegal use==\n[[Image:USCG pursuing gofast boat.jpg|thumb|A helicopter from the U.S. Coast Guard's [[Helicopter Interdiction Tactical Squadron]] pursues a go-fast boat during training]]\nThese boats are difficult to detect by [[radar]] except on flat calm seas or at close range. The United States Coast Guard and the DEA found them to be [[Stealth technology|stealthy]], fast, seaworthy, and very difficult to intercept using conventional craft. Because of this, Coast Guards have developed their own high-speed craft and use [[helicopter]]s equipped with [[anti-materiel rifle]]s used to disable engines of fleeing boats. The U.S. Coast Guard go-fast boat is a [[rigid-hulled inflatable boat]] (RHIB) equipped with radar and powerful engines.

An eminent example of [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] civic architecture, the building was constructed between 1882 and 1888 to a competition winning design by Scottish architect [[William Young (architect)|William Young]] a native of Paisley.\n\nInaugurated in August 1888 by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], the first council meeting was held within the chambers in October 1889.<ref>[http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/YourCouncil/Council_Committees/CityChambers/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111144517/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/YourCouncil/Council_Committees/CityChambers/ |date=11 January 2010 }}</ref> The building originally had an area of 5,016 square metres. In 1923, an extension to the east side of the building in John Street was opened and in 1984 Exchange House in George Street was completed, increasing the size of the City Chambers complex to some 14,000 square metres.\n[[File:Scotland - Glasgow City Chambers - 20141112102601.jpg|alt=Entrance, Glasgow City Chambers|thumb|Entrance, Glasgow City Chambers]]\n\n==History==\nThe need for a new city chambers had been apparent since the 18th century, with the old [[Tolbooth]] at [[Glasgow Cross]] becoming insufficient for the purposes of civic government in a growing town with greater political responsibilities. In 1814, the Tolbooth was sold \u2013 with the exception of the steeple, which still remains \u2013 and the council chambers moved to Jail Square in the Saltmarket, near [[Glasgow Green]]. Subsequent moves were made to Wilson Street and Ingram Street.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5szc9GBZLwwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA149 |title=Public Sculpture of Glasgow|author= Ray McKenzie  |publisher=University Press |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> In the early 1880s, City Architect John Carrick was asked to identify a suitable site for a purpose built City Council Chambers. Carrick identified the east side of George Square, which was then bought.\n\nThe new City Chambers initially housed Glasgow Town Council from 1888 to 1895, when it was replaced by Glasgow Corporation. It remained the Corporation's headquarters until it was replaced by Glasgow District Council under the wider [[Strathclyde]] Regional Council in May 1975. The City Chambers has been the headquarters of Glasgow City Council since April 1996, when it replaced the District Council with the abolition of the Strathclyde Region.\n\n==Exterior==\nThe building is in the [[Beaux arts architecture|Beaux arts style]], an interpretation of Renaissance [[Classicism]] incorporating [[Italianate architecture|Italianate styles]] with a vast range of ornate decoration, used to express the wealth and industrial export-led economic prosperity of the Second City of the Empire.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5szc9GBZLwwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA150 |title=Public Sculpture of Glasgow|author= Ray McKenzie  |publisher=University Press |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> The exterior sculpture, by James Alexander Ewing, included the central Jubilee [[Pediment]] as its centrepiece. Although originally intended to feature a figure symbolising Glasgow 'with the Clyde at her feet sending her manufactures to all the world', the Pediment was redesigned to celebrate Queen Victoria's [[Golden Jubilee]]. It depicts Victoria enthroned, surrounded by emblematic figures of Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales, alongside the colonies of the [[British Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5szc9GBZLwwC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA156 |title=Public Sculpture of Glasgow|author= Ray McKenzie  |publisher=University Press |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> Ewing also designed the apex sculptures of Truth, Riches, and Honour, and the statues of The Four Seasons on the Chamber's tower. The central apex figure of Truth is popularly known as Glasgow's [[Statue of Liberty]], because of its close resemblance to the similarly posed, but very much larger, statue in New York harbour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/120100/details/glasgow+82+george+square+city+chambers/ |title=Site Record for Glasgow, 82 George Square, City Chambers 249\u2013285 George Street; 35\u201355 John Street; Cochrane Street Details |publisher=Canmore.rcahms.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref>\n\n==Interior==\nThe entrance hall of the Chambers displays a mosaic of the city's [[coat of arms]] on the floor. The arms reflect legends about Glasgow's [[patron saint]], [[Saint Mungo]], and include four emblems \u2013 the bird, tree, bell, and fish \u2013 as remembered in the following verse:\n\n:''Here's the Bird that never flew''\n:''Here's the Tree that never grew''\n:''Here's the Bell that never rang''\n:''Here's the Fish that never swam''\n\nAn abstract tapestry hanging in the hall is intended to represent Glasgow's past and present.\n\nPillars of [[marble]] and [[granite]] give way to staircases of [[Carrara marble]], [[freestone (masonry)|freestone]], and [[alabaster]], and a ceiling decorated in [[gold leaf]] is topped by a [[stained glass]] dome.\n\nThe [[Councillor]]'s Corridor, containing councillors' mailboxes and decorated in Italian [[faience]], leads to the Committee Rooms, where formal business committees meet, and a library.\n\nThe corridor also leads into the Council Chamber. This is where the Council meets formally, featuring Spanish [[mahogany]] panelling. There are seats for each of the 79 councillors, situated in a [[Hemicycle]], all facing the [[Lord Provost]] (the Scottish equivalent of the [[Mayors in England|lord mayor]] found in London and other cities), their Depute, and the chief executive, who are seated behind the [[Ceremonial mace|mace]]. A public gallery looks down on the proceedings, and a small press gallery is located at the side.\n\nThe Lord Provost's main office is decorated in the same [[Venice|Venetian]] style as the rest of the building. Famous visitors, including the [[British Royal family]] have signed the visitor book here.\n\nThe municipal mace is kept in an ante-room leading to the Lord Provost's office. Part of the ritual of the Council's proceedings is that the mace is carried by the Council Officer when leading the Lord Provost into the Council Chamber to chair full council meetings. The mace is made from gold-plated silver, and was presented to the council in 1912.\n\nAdjacent to the Council Chamber, there are three rooms used for civic functions and large meetings: the Satinwood Salon, Octagonal Room, and the Mahogany Salon. These rooms are decorated in woods as their names imply, and also house a selection of paintings.\n\nThe banquet hall has witnessed many different types of events, from formal civil ones to record launches, fashion shows, children's Christmas parties and private functions. [[Nelson Mandela]] received his [[Freedom of the City]] here in 1993.\n\nThe hall is 33.5 m long by 14.6 m wide and 15.8 m high. The carpet comes in three sections which are rotated regularly to prevent wear. The carpet design reflects the ornate pattern of the roof. Huge [[Glasgow School]] murals decorate the walls, depicting the granting of the city's charter, its history and culture, and the four main Scottish rivers. The hall's electric chandeliers, or \"[[electrolier]]s\", were designed in 1885.\n\nThe daily tours of the Chambers conclude on the Upper Gallery on the third floor, which lets one see the detail on the  dome visible from the other floors, as well as portraits of former Lord Provosts.\n\n==Popular culture==\nThe Chambers were used as part of the location for ''[[The House of Mirth (2000 film)|The House of Mirth]]'' an adaptation of the novel by [[Edith Wharton]] by [[Terence Davies]] starring [[Gillian Anderson]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]].\n\nThey were also used as a stand in for the Kremlin in the film ''[[An Englishman Abroad]]'' and as the Vatican in ''[[Heavenly Pursuits]]''.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/sep/16/glasgow-favourite-location-hollywood-filmmakers</ref>\n\nThe Chambers featured in the ''[[Still Game]]'' episode \"Job\".\n\nThe Chambers also featured in the international television series [[Outlander (TV series)|Outlander]]. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.walkhighlands.co.uk/news/our-pick-outlander-filming-locations/0016071/|title=Our pick: Outlander filming locations|work=Walkhighlands|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|Glasgow City Chambers}}\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Care_Support/SensoryServices/Visuallyimpaired_blindpeople/Guides/guidetocitychambers.htm|publisher=Glasgow City Council|author=|date=|accessdate=2009-06-22|title=Guide to Glasgow City Chambers}} niaph caster was born in 1813 which was 201 years ago (as of 2014).

The story is set in [[Clayton County, Georgia|Clayton County]] and [[Atlanta]], both in [[Georgia, US|Georgia]], during the [[American Civil War]] and [[Reconstruction Era]]. It depicts the struggles of young Scarlett O'Hara, the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do plantation owner, who must use every means at her disposal to claw her way out of poverty following [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman's]] destructive \"[[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]\". This historical novel features a ''[[Bildungsroman]]'' or coming-of-age story, with the title taken from a poem written by [[Ernest Dowson]].<ref>[[Margaret Mitchell]], touched by the \"far away, faintly sad sound I wanted\" of the third stanza's first line, chose that line as the title of her novel ''Gone with the Wind''. https://www.awesomestories.com/asset/view/SOURCE-of-the-TITLE-GWTW-Margaret-Mitchell-Gone-with-the-Wind</ref>\n\n''Gone with the Wind'' was popular with American readers from the outset and was the top American fiction bestseller in 1936 and 1937. As of 2014, a [[Harris poll]] found it to be the second favorite book of American readers, just behind the Bible. More than 30 million copies have been printed worldwide.\n\nWritten from the perspective of the slaveholder, ''Gone with the Wind'' is Southern plantation fiction. Its portrayal of slavery and African Americans has been considered controversial, especially by succeeding generations, as well as its use of a racial epithet and ethnic slurs common to the period. However, the novel has become a reference point for subsequent writers of the South, both black and white. Scholars at American universities refer to, interpret, and study it in their writings. The novel has been absorbed into American popular culture.\n\nMitchell received the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] for the book in 1937. It was adapted into a [[Gone with the Wind (film)|1939 American film]]. ''Gone with the Wind'' is the only novel by Mitchell published during her lifetime.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1108.html Obituary:  Miss Mitchell, 49, Dead of Injuries] (August 17, 1949) ''New York Times''.

Mitchell identified the primary theme as survival. She left the ending speculative for the reader. She was often asked what became of her lovers, Rhett and Scarlett. She replied, \"For all I know, Rhett may have found someone else who was less difficult.\"<ref name=autogenerated63 />  Two sequels authorized by Mitchell's estate were published more than a half century later. A parody was also produced.\n\n==Biographical background and publication==\n\nBorn in 1900 in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia, US|Georgia]], [[Margaret Mitchell]] was a Southerner and writer throughout her life. She grew up hearing stories about the American Civil War and the Reconstruction from her tyrannical Irish-American grandmother, who had endured its suffering. Her forceful and intellectual mother was a [[suffragist]] who fought for the rights of women to vote.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Road to Tara: The Life of Margaret Mitchell|last=Edwards|first=Anne|publisher=Ticknor & Fields|year=1983|isbn=9780899191690|location=New Haven, Connecticut|pages=17\u201318}}</ref><!--Father and grandfathers?  -->\n\nAs a young woman, Mitchell found love with an army lieutenant. He was killed in World War I, and she would carry his memory for the remainder of her life. After studying at [[Smith College]] for a year, during which time her mother died from the [[Spanish flu]], Mitchell returned to Atlanta. She married, but her husband was an abusive bootlegger. Mitchell took a job writing feature articles for the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'' at a time when Atlanta debutantes of her class did not work. After divorcing her first husband, she married again, this time to a man who shared her interest in writing and literature. He had also been best man at her first wedding.{{citation needed|date = October 2017}}\n\nMargaret Mitchell began writing ''Gone with the Wind'' in 1926 to pass the time while recovering from a slow-healing auto-crash injury.<ref name=autogenerated63>[http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/pdf/GWTW.pdf \"People on the Home Front: Margaret Mitchell\"], Sgt.

The novel unfolds against the backdrop of [[rebellion]] wherein seven southern states initially, including Georgia, have declared their [[secession]] from the United States (the \"Union\") and formed the [[Confederate States of America]] (the \"Confederacy\"), after [[Abraham Lincoln]] was elected president. The Union refuses to accept secession and no compromise is found as war approaches.\n\n===Part I===\n\nThe novel opens April 15, 1861,<ref>As the narrative begins, \"'General Beauregard shelled [the Yankees] out of [[Fort Sumter]] day before yesterday'\" (April 13), Part 1, Chapter 1, 15th paragraph.</ref>  at \"[[Tara (plantation)|Tara]],\" a plantation owned by Gerald O'Hara, an Irish immigrant who has become a successful planter, and his wife, Ellen Robillard O'Hara, from a coastal aristocratic family of French descent. Their 16-year-old daughter, Scarlett, is not beautiful, but men seldom realized it once they were caught up in her charm. All the talk is of the coming Civil War.<ref name=autogenerated5>Part 1, chapter 1</ref>\n\nThere are brief but vivid descriptions of the South as it began and grew, with backgrounds of the main characters: the stylish and highbrow French, the gentlemanly English, the forced-to-flee and looked-down-upon Irish. Scarlett learns that one of her many beaux, Ashley Wilkes, will soon be engaged to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton. She is heart-stricken. The next day at the Wilkeses' barbecue at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett tells Ashley she loves him, and he admits he cares for her.<ref name=autogenerated3>Part 1, chapter 6</ref> However, he knows he would not be happy if married to her because of their personality differences. She loses her temper with him, and he silently takes it.\n\n[[Rhett Butler]], who has a reputation as a rogue, had been alone in the library when Ashley and Scarlett entered and felt it wiser to stay unseen during the argument. Rhett applauds Scarlett for the \"unladylike\" spirit she displayed with Ashley. Infuriated and humiliated, she tells Rhett, \"You aren't fit to wipe his boots!\"<ref name=autogenerated3 />\n\nAfter rejoining the other party guests, she learns that war has been declared and the men are going to enlist. Seeking revenge, Scarlett accepts a marriage proposal from Melanie's brother, Charles Hamilton. They marry two weeks later. Charles dies of pneumonia following the measles two months after the war begins. As a young widow, Scarlett gives birth to her first child, Wade Hampton Hamilton, named after his father's general.<ref name=autogenerated4>Part 1, chapter 7</ref> She is bound by custom to wear black and avoid conversation with young men. Scarlett feels restricted by these conventions and bitterly misses her life as a young, unmarried woman.\n\n===Part II===\n\nAunt Pittypat is living with Melanie in [[Atlanta]] and invites Scarlett to stay with them. In Atlanta, Scarlett's spirits revive, and she is busy with hospital work and sewing circles for the Confederate Army. Scarlett encounters Rhett Butler again at a benefit dance, where he is dressed like a [[dandy]].<ref name=autogenerated70 /> Although Rhett believes the war is a lost cause, he is [[blockade runner|blockade running]] for profit.

Melanie defends her, arguing she is supporting the cause for which Melanie's husband, Ashley, is fighting.\n\nAt Christmas (1863), Ashley is granted a furlough from the army. Melanie becomes pregnant with their first child.\n\n===Part III===\nThe war is going badly for the Confederacy. By September 1864, Atlanta is besieged from three sides.<ref name=autogenerated156>Part 3, chapter 17</ref> The city becomes desperate and hundreds of wounded Confederate soldiers pour in. Melanie goes into labor with only the inexperienced Scarlett to assist, as all the doctors are attending the soldiers. Prissy, a young slave, cries out in despair and fear, \"De Yankees is comin!\"<ref name=autogenerated10>Part 3, chapter 22</ref> In the chaos, Scarlett, left to fend for herself, cries for the comfort and safety of her mother and Tara. The tattered [[Confederate States Army]] sets flame to Atlanta and abandons it to the [[Union Army]].\n\nMelanie gives birth to a boy, Beau, with Scarlett's assistance. Scarlett then finds Rhett and begs him to take herself, Wade, Melanie, Beau, and Prissy to Tara. Rhett laughs at the idea but steals an emaciated horse and a small [[wagon]], and they follow the retreating army out of Atlanta.\n\nPart way to Tara, Rhett has a change of heart and abandons Scarlett to enlist in the army (he later recounts that when they learned he had attended [[West Point]], they put him in the artillery, which may have saved his life). Scarlett then makes her way to Tara, where she is welcomed on the steps by her father, Gerald. Things have drastically changed: Scarlett's mother is dead, her father has lost his mind with grief, her sisters are sick with [[typhoid fever]], the [[field slaves]] have left after Emancipation, the Yankees have burned all the cotton, and there is no food in the house. Scarlett avows that she and her family will survive and never be hungry again.\n\nThe long tiring struggle for survival begins that has Scarlett working in the fields. There are hungry people to feed and little food. There is the ever-present threat of the Yankees who steal and burn. At one point, a Yankee soldier trespasses on Tara, and it is implied that he would steal from the house and possibly rape Scarlett and Melanie. Scarlett kills him with Charles's pistol, and sees that Melanie had also prepared to fight him with a sword.\n\nA long post-war succession of Confederate soldiers returning home stop at Tara to find food and rest. Eventually, Ashley returns from the war, with his idealistic view of the world shattered.\n\n===Part IV===\nLife at Tara slowly begins to recover, but then new taxes are levied on the plantation. Scarlett knows only one man with enough money to help her: Rhett Butler. She looks for him in Atlanta only to learn that he is in jail. Rhett refuses to give money to Scarlett, and leaving the jailhouse in fury, she runs into Frank Kennedy, who runs a store in Atlanta and is betrothed to Scarlett's sister, Suellen. Realizing Frank also has money, Scarlett hatches a plot and tells Frank that Suellen will not marry him. Frank succumbs to Scarlett's charms and marries her two weeks later, knowing he has done \"something romantic and exciting for the first time in his life.\"<ref name=autogenerated56>Part 4, chapter 35</ref> Always wanting her to be happy and radiant, Frank gives Scarlett the money to pay the taxes.\n\nWhile Frank has a cold and is pampered by Aunt Pittypat, Scarlett goes over the accounts at Frank's store and finds that many owe him money. Scarlett is now terrified about the taxes and decides money, a lot of it, is needed. She takes control of the store, and her business practices leave many Atlantans resentful of her. With a loan from Rhett she buys a [[sawmill]] and runs it herself, all scandalous conduct. To Frank's relief, Scarlett learns she is pregnant, which curtails her \"unladylike\" activities for a while. She convinces Ashley to come to Atlanta and manage the mill, all the while still in love with him. At Melanie's urging, Ashley takes the job. Melanie becomes the center of Atlanta society, and Scarlett gives birth to Ella Lorena: \"Ella for her grandmother Ellen, and Lorena because it was the most fashionable name of the day for girls.\"<ref name=autogenerated14>Part 4, chapter 42</ref>\n\nGeorgia is under [[martial law]], and life has taken on a new and more frightening tone. For protection, Scarlett keeps Frank's pistol tucked in the upholstery of the buggy. Her trips alone to and from the mill take her past a [[shantytown]] where criminal elements live. While on her way home one evening, she is accosted by two men who try to rob her, but she escapes with the help of Big Sam, the former Negro foreman from Tara. Attempting to avenge his wife, Frank and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] raid the shantytown whereupon Frank is shot dead. Scarlett is a widow again.\n\nTo keep the raiders from being arrested, Rhett puts on a charade. He walks into the Wilkeses' home with Hugh Elsing and Ashley, singing and pretending to be drunk. Yankee officers outside question Rhett, and he says he and the other men had been at Belle Watling's [[brothel]] that evening, a story Belle later confirms to the officers. The men are indebted to Rhett, and his [[scalawag|Scallawag]] reputation among them improves a notch, but the men's wives, except Melanie, are livid at owing their husbands' lives to Belle Watling.\n\nFrank Kennedy lies in a [[casket]] in the quiet stillness of the parlor in Aunt Pittypat's home. Scarlett is remorseful. She is swigging [[brandy]] from Aunt Pitty's swoon bottle when Rhett comes to call. She tells him tearfully, \"I'm afraid I'll die and go to hell.\" He says, \"Maybe there isn't a hell.\"<ref name=autogenerated12>Part 4, chapter 47</ref> Before she can cry any further, he asks her to marry him, saying, \"I always intended having you, one way or another.\"<ref name=autogenerated12 /> She says she doesn't love him and doesn't want to be married again. However, he kisses her passionately, and in the heat of the moment she agrees to marry him. One year later, Scarlett and Rhett announce their engagement, which becomes the talk of the town.\n\n===Part V===\nMr. and Mrs. Butler honeymoon in [[New Orleans]], spending lavishly. Upon returning to Atlanta, they stay in the bridal suite at the National Hotel while their new home on [[Peachtree Street]] is being built. Scarlett chooses a modern [[Swiss chalet style]] home like the one she saw in ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', with red wallpaper, thick red carpet, and black walnut furniture. Rhett describes it as an \"architectural horror\".<ref name=autogenerated18>Part 5, chapter 50</ref> Shortly after they move in to their new home, the sardonic jabs between them turn into full-blown quarrels. Scarlett wonders why Rhett married her. Then \"with real hate in her eyes\",<ref name=autogenerated18 /> she tells Rhett she will have a baby, which she does not want.\n\n[[File:The Bonnie Blue Flag - Project Gutenberg eText 21566.jpg|thumbnail|[[The Bonnie Blue Flag]], is an 1861 marching song that refers to the first unofficial flag of the Confederacy.]]\n\nWade is seven years old in 1869 when his half-sister, [[Eug\u00e9nie de Montijo|Eugenie]] [[Queen Victoria|Victoria]], named after two queens, is born. She has blue eyes like Gerald O'Hara, and Melanie nicknames her, \"Bonnie Blue,\" in reference to the [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Bonnie Blue Flag]] of the Confederacy.\n\nWhen Scarlett is feeling well again, she makes a trip to the mill and talks to Ashley, who is alone in the office. In their conversation, she comes away believing Ashley still loves her and is jealous of her intimate relations with Rhett, which excites her. She returns home and tells Rhett she does not want more children. From then on, they sleep separately, and when Bonnie is two years old, she sleeps in a little bed beside Rhett (with the light on all night because she is afraid of the dark). Rhett turns his attention toward Bonnie, dotes on her, spoils her, and worries about her reputation when she is older.\n\nMelanie is giving a surprise birthday party for Ashley. Scarlett goes to the mill to keep Ashley there until party time, a rare opportunity for her to see him alone. When she sees him, she feels \"sixteen again, a little breathless and excited.\"<ref>Part 5, chapter 53</ref> Ashley tells her how pretty she looks, and they reminisce about the days when they were young and talk about their lives now. Suddenly Scarlett's eyes fill with tears, and Ashley holds her head against his chest. Ashley sees his sister, India Wilkes, standing in the doorway. Before the party has even begun, a rumor of an affair between Ashley and Scarlett spreads, and Rhett and Melanie hear it. Melanie refuses to accept any criticism of her sister-in-law, and India Wilkes is banished from the Wilkeses' home for it, causing a rift in the family.\n\nRhett, more drunk than Scarlett has ever seen him, returns home from the party long after Scarlett. His eyes are bloodshot, and his mood is dark and violent. He enjoins Scarlett to drink with him. Not wanting him to know she is fearful of him, she throws back a drink and gets up from her chair to go back to her bedroom. He stops her and pins her shoulders to the wall. She tells him he is jealous of Ashley, and Rhett accuses her of \"crying for the moon\"<ref name=autogenerated17>Part 5, chapter 54</ref> over Ashley. He tells her they could have been happy together saying, \"for I loved you and I know you.\"<ref name=autogenerated17 /> He then takes her in his arms and carries her up the stairs to her bedroom, where it is strongly implied that he rapes her\u2014or, possibly, that they have consensual sex following the argument.\n\nThe next morning, Rhett leaves for Charleston and New Orleans with Bonnie. Scarlett finds herself missing him, but she is still unsure if Rhett loves her, having said it while drunk. She learns she is pregnant with her fourth child.\n\nWhen Rhett returns, Scarlett waits for him at the top of the stairs. She wonders if Rhett will kiss her, but to her irritation, he does not. He says she looks pale. She says it's because she is pregnant. He sarcastically asks if the father is Ashley. She calls Rhett a cad and tells him no woman would want his baby. He says, \"Cheer up, maybe you'll have a miscarriage.\"<ref name=autogenerated15>Part 5, chapter 56</ref> She lunges at him, but he dodges, and she tumbles backwards down the stairs. She is seriously ill for the first time in her life, having lost her child and broken her ribs. Rhett is remorseful, believing he has killed her. Sobbing and drunk, he buries his head in Melanie's lap and confesses he has been a jealous cad.\n\nScarlett, who is thin and pale, goes to Tara, taking Wade and Ella with her, to regain her strength and vitality from \"the green cotton fields of home.\"<ref name=autogenerated16>Part 5, chapter 57</ref> When she returns healthy to Atlanta, she sells the mills to Ashley. She finds Rhett's attitude has noticeably changed. He is sober, kinder, polite\u2014and seemingly disinterested. Though she misses the old Rhett at times, Scarlett is content to leave well enough alone.\n\nBonnie is four years old in 1873. Spirited and willful, she has her father wrapped around her finger and giving in to her every demand. Even Scarlett is jealous of the attention Bonnie gets. Rhett rides his horse around town with Bonnie in front of him, but Mammy insists it is not fitting for a girl to ride a horse with her dress flying up. Rhett heeds her words and buys Bonnie a [[Shetland pony]], whom she names \"Mr. Butler,\" and teaches her to ride [[sidesaddle]]. Then Rhett pays a boy named Wash twenty-five cents to teach Mr. Butler to jump over wood bars. When Mr. Butler is able to get his fat legs over a one-foot bar, Rhett puts Bonnie on the pony, and soon Mr. Butler is leaping bars and Aunt Melly's rose bushes.\n\nWearing her blue velvet [[riding habit]] with a red feather in her black hat, Bonnie pleads with her father to raise the bar to one and a half feet. He gives in, warning her not to come crying if she falls. Bonnie yells to her mother, \"Watch me take this one!\"<ref>Part 5, chapter 59</ref> The pony gallops towards the wood bar, but trips over it. Bonnie breaks her neck in the fall, and dies.\n\nIn the dark days and months following Bonnie's death, Rhett is often drunk and disheveled, while Scarlett, though deeply bereaved also, seems to hold up under the strain. With the untimely death of Melanie Wilkes who was pregnant again, a short time later, Rhett decides he only wants the calm dignity of the genial South he once knew in his youth and leaves Atlanta to find it. Meanwhile, Scarlett dreams of love that has eluded her for so long. However, she still has Tara and knows she can win Rhett back, because \"tomorrow is another day.\"<ref name=autogenerated50>Part 5, chapter 63</ref>\n\n==Structure==\n\n===Coming-of-age story===\nMargaret Mitchell arranged ''Gone with the Wind'' chronologically, basing it on the life and experiences of the main character, Scarlett O'Hara, as she grew from adolescence into adulthood.

Author [[Pat Conroy]], in his preface to a later edition of the novel, describes Mitchell's portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan as having \"the same romanticized role it had in ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' and appears to be a benign combination of the Elks Club and a men's equestrian society\".<ref>Pat Conroy, Preface to ''Gone With the Wind'', Pocket Books edition</ref>\n\nRegarding the historical inaccuracies of the novel, historian [[Richard N. Current]] points out:\n\n<blockquote>No doubt it is indeed unfortunate that ''Gone with the Wind'' perpetuates many myths about Reconstruction, particularly with respect to blacks. Margaret Mitchell did not originate them and a young novelist can scarcely be faulted for not knowing what the majority of mature, professional historians did not know until many years later.<ref>Albert E.

Scarlett was asked by a Yankee woman for advice on who to appoint as a nurse for her children; Scarlett suggested a \"darky\", much to the disgust of the Yankee woman who was seeking an Irish maid, a \"Bridget\".<ref name=autogenerated47 />  African Americans and [[Irish American]]s are treated \"in precisely the same way\" in ''Gone with the Wind'', writes David O'Connell in his 1996 book, ''The Irish Roots of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind''. Ethnic slurs on the Irish and Irish stereotypes pervade the novel, O'Connell claims, and Scarlett is not an exception to the terminology.<ref>O'Connell, D., ''The Irish Roots of Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind'', p. 14-15 & 71.</ref>  Irish scholar Geraldine Higgins notes that Jonas Wilkerson labels Scarlett:  \"you highflying, bogtrotting Irish\".<ref>Part 5, chapter 49</ref> Higgins says that, as the Irish American O'Haras were slaveholders and African Americans were held in bondage, the two ethnic groups are not equivalent in the ethnic hierarchy of the novel.<ref>Giemza, B. A., ''Rethinking the Irish in the American South: Beyond Rounders and Reelers'', p. 80-81 & 83.</ref>\n\nThe novel has been criticized for promoting plantation values. Mitchell biographer Marianne Walker, author of ''Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh: The Love Story Behind Gone with the Wind'', believes that those who attack the book on these grounds have not read it. She said that the popular 1939 film \"promotes a false notion of the Old South\". Mitchell was not involved in the screenplay or film production.<ref>Marianne Walker (1993), ''Margaret Mitchell and John Marsh: The Love Story behind Gone With the Wind'', Atlanta: Peachtree Publishers, p. vii (preface to 2011 edition). {{ISBN|978-1-56145-617-8}}</ref>\n\n[[James W.

He wanted poor farmers to grow alternative crops, such as [[peanut]]s and [[sweet potatoes]], as a source of their own food and to improve their quality of life. The most popular of his 44 practical bulletins for farmers contained 105 food recipes using peanuts.

The exact date of his birth is uncertain and was not known to Carver \u2013 however it was before slavery was abolished in Missouri in January 1865 after the [[American Civil War]]. His master, [[Moses Carver]], was a [[German American]] immigrant who had purchased George's parents, Mary and Giles, from William P. McGinnis on October 9, 1855, for $700.<ref>McMurry (1982), ''George Washington Carver'', pp. 9\u201310.</ref><ref name=\"gwcnps\"/>\n\nWhen George was only a week old, he, a sister, and his mother were kidnapped by night raiders from [[Arkansas]]. George's brother, James, was rushed to safety from the kidnappers. The kidnappers sold the slaves in [[Kentucky]]. Moses Carver hired John Bentley to find them, but he located only the infant George. Moses negotiated with the raiders to gain the boy's return, and rewarded Bentley. After slavery was abolished, Moses Carver and his wife Susan raised George and his older brother James as their own children. They encouraged George to continue his intellectual pursuits, and \"Aunt Susan\" taught him the basics of reading and writing.<ref name=\"Pioneers\">{{citation |editor1-first=Richard |editor1-last=Rennert |others= [[Coretta Scott King]] (introduction) |title=Profiles of Great Black Americans: Pioneers of Discovery |year=1994 |publisher=Chelsea House Publishers |location=New York  |isbn=0-7910-2067-3 |pages=26\u201332 }}</ref>\n\n[[Black people]] were not allowed at the public school in Diamond Grove. George decided to go to a school for black children 10 miles (16&nbsp;km) south in [[Neosho, Missouri|Neosho]]. When he reached the town, he found the school closed for the night. He slept in a nearby barn. By his own account, the next morning he met a kind woman, Mariah Watkins, from whom he wished to rent a room. When he identified himself as \"Carver's George,\" as he had done his whole life, she replied that from now on his name was \"George Carver\". George liked Mariah Watkins, and her words, \"You must learn all you can, then go back out into the world and give your learning back to the people\", made a great impression on him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Abrams|first1=Dennis|title=George Washington Carver: Scientist and Educator|publisher=Chelsea House Publications|isbn=978-0791097175|pages=16}}</ref>\n\nAt the age of 13, due to his desire to attend the academy there, he relocated to the home of another foster family in [[Fort Scott, Kansas]]. After witnessing a black man killed by a group of whites, Carver left the city. He attended a series of schools before earning his diploma at [[Minneapolis High School]] in [[Minneapolis, Kansas]].\n\n==College==\n[[File:Carver1web.jpg|thumb|200px|At work in his laboratory]]\nCarver applied to several colleges before being accepted at [[Highland University]] in [[Highland, Kansas]].

Carver did research at the [[Iowa Agriculture and Home Economics Experiment Station|Iowa Experiment Station]] under Pammel during the next two years. His work at the experiment station in plant [[pathology]] and [[mycology]] first gained him national recognition and respect as a botanist.  Carver taught as the first black faculty member at Iowa State.\n\n==Tuskegee Institute==\n[[File:George Washington Carver, ca. 1902.jpg|thumb|George Washington Carver (front row, center) poses with fellow faculty of [[Tuskegee Institute]] in this c. 1902 photograph taken by [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]].]]\nIn 1896, [[Booker T. Washington]], the first principal and president of the  Tuskegee Institute (now [[Tuskegee University]]), invited Carver to head its Agriculture Department. Carver taught there for 47 years, developing the department into a strong research center and working with two additional college presidents during his tenure. He taught methods of crop rotation, introduced several alternative cash crops for farmers that would also improve the soil of areas heavily cultivated in cotton, initiated research into crop products (chemurgy), and taught generations of black students farming techniques for self-sufficiency.\n\nCarver designed a mobile classroom to take education out to farmers. He called it a \"Jesup wagon\" after the New York financier and [[philanthropist]] [[Morris Ketchum Jesup]], who provided funding to support the program.<ref>[http://www.cr.nps.gov/museum/exhibits/tuskegee/gwcwagon.htm \"The first Jesup Wagon\"], George Washington Carver Museum, Tuskegee University Historic Site, National Park Service website.</ref>\n\nTo recruit Carver to Tuskegee, Washington gave him an above average salary and two rooms for his personal use, although both concessions were resented by some other faculty. Because he had earned a master's in a scientific field from a \"white\" institution, some faculty perceived him as arrogant.<ref>McMurry (1982), pp. 45\u201347.</ref> Unmarried faculty members normally had to share rooms, with two to a room, in the spartan early days of the institute.\n\nOne of Carver's duties was to administer the Agricultural Experiment Station farms. He had to manage the production and sale of farm products to generate revenue for the Institute. He soon proved to be a poor administrator. In 1900, Carver complained that the physical work and the letter-writing required were too much.<ref>Louis R.

Carver replied in writing, \"Now to be branded as a liar and party to such hellish deception it is more than I can bear, and if your committee feel that I have willfully lied or [was] party to such lies as were told my resignation is at your disposal.\"<ref>Harlan, Vol. 8, p. 95.</ref> During Washington's last five years at Tuskegee, Carver submitted or threatened his resignation several times: when the administration reorganized the agriculture programs,<ref>Harlan, Volume 10, p. 480.</ref> when he disliked a teaching assignment,<ref>Harlan, Vol. 12, p. 95.</ref> to manage an experiment station elsewhere,<ref>Harlan, Vol. 12, pp. 251\u2013252.</ref> and when he did not get summer teaching assignments in 1913\u201314.<ref>Harlan, Vol. 12, p. 201.</ref><ref>Harlan, Vol. 13, p. 35.</ref> In each case, Washington smoothed things over.\n\n[[File:George Washington Carver by Frances Benjamin Johnston.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of George Washington Carver taken by [[Frances Benjamin Johnston]] in 1906.]]\nCarver started his academic career as a researcher and teacher. In 1911, Washington wrote a letter to him complaining that Carver had not followed orders to plant particular crops at the experiment station. This revealed Washington's [[micro-management]] of Carver's department, which he had headed for more than 10 years by then. Washington at the same time refused Carver's requests for a new laboratory, research supplies for his exclusive use, and respite from teaching classes. Washington praised Carver's abilities in teaching and original research but said about his administrative skills:\n \n<blockquote>When it comes to the organization of classes, the ability required to secure a properly organized and large school or section of a school, you are wanting in ability. When it comes to the matter of practical farm managing which will secure definite, practical, financial results, you are wanting again in ability.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1911, Carver complained that his laboratory had not received the equipment which Washington had promised 11 months before. He also complained about Institute committee meetings.<ref>Harlan, Vol. 4, p. 239.</ref> Washington praised Carver in his 1911 memoir, ''My Larger Education: Being Chapters from My Experience''.<ref>[http://docsouth.unc.edu/fpn/washeducation/menu.html Booker T.

He spoke at the 1930 Conclave that was held at Tuskegee, Alabama, in which he delivered a powerful and emotional speech to the men in attendance.<ref>[http://www.pbs1914.org/notable_sigmas/education_science/P21/ Education & Science - Notable Sigmas], Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723220545/http://www.pbs1914.org/notable_sigmas/education_science/P21/ |date=July 23, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1915 to 1923, Carver concentrated on researching and experimenting with new uses for peanuts, sweet potatoes, soybeans, pecans, and other crops, as well as having his assistants research and compile existing uses.<ref name=\"Special_History_Study\">[http://www.nps.gov/applications/parks/gwca/ppdocuments/Special%20History%20Study.pdf Special History Study<!-- Bot generated title -->] from the [[National Park Service]] website</ref> This work, and especially his speaking to a national conference of the Peanut Growers Association in 1920 and in testimony before Congress in 1921 to support passage of a tariff on imported peanuts, brought him wide publicity and increasing renown. In these years, he became one of the most well-known African Americans of his time.\n\n==Rise to fame==\n[[File:GEORGE WASHINGTON CARVER - ONE OF AMERICA'S GREAT SCIENTISTS - NARA - 535694.jpg|thumb|left|300px|\"One of America's great scientists.\" U.S. World War II poster circa 1943]]\nCarver developed techniques to improve soils depleted by repeated plantings of [[cotton]]. Together with other agricultural experts, he urged farmers to restore [[nitrogen]] to their soils by practicing systematic [[crop rotation]]: alternating cotton crops with plantings of [[sweet potatoes]] or [[legumes]] (such as [[peanut]]s, [[soybean]]s and [[cowpea]]s). These crops both restored nitrogen to the soil and were good for human consumption. Following the crop rotation practice resulted in improved cotton yields and gave farmers alternative cash crops. To train farmers to successfully rotate and cultivate the new crops, Carver developed an agricultural extension program for Alabama that was similar to the one at Iowa State. To encourage better nutrition in the South, he widely distributed recipes using the alternative crops.\n\nAdditionally, he founded an industrial research laboratory, where he and assistants worked to popularize the new crops by developing hundreds of applications for them. They did original research as well as promoting applications and recipes, which they collected from others. Carver distributed his information as agricultural bulletins.\n\n[[File:George Washington Carver-peanut specimen.jpeg|right|thumb|200px|Peanut specimen collected by Carver]]\nCarver's work was known by officials in the national capital before he became a public figure. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] publicly admired his work. Former professors of Carver's from Iowa State University were appointed to positions as Secretary of Agriculture: [[James Wilson (U.S. politician)|James Wilson]], a former dean and professor of Carver's, served from 1897 to 1913. [[Henry Cantwell Wallace]] served from 1921 to 1924. He knew Carver personally because his son [[Henry A.

He consulted with Carver.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://files.usgwarchives.org/la/winn/bios/edenborn.txt |title=Greggory E.

Carver's promotion of peanuts gained him the most notice. In 1919, Carver wrote to a peanut company about the potential he saw for peanut milk. Both he and the peanut industry seemed unaware that in 1917 William Melhuish had secured {{cite patent |country=US |number= 1243855 |gdate=1917-10-23}} for a milk substitute made from peanuts and soybeans.{{synthesis inline|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe United Peanut Associations of America invited Carver to speak at their 1920 convention. He discussed \"The Possibilities of the Peanut\" and exhibited 145 peanut products. By 1920, the U.S. peanut farmers were being undercut by low prices on imported peanuts from the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]].\n\nIn 1921, peanut farmers and industry representatives planned to appear at Congressional hearings to ask for a [[tariff]]. Based on the quality of Carver's presentation at their convention, they asked the African-American professor to testify on the tariff issue before the [[House Ways and Means Committee|Ways and Means Committee]] of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Due to [[Racial segregation|segregation]], it was highly unusual for an African American to appear as an expert witness at Congress representing European-American industry and farmers. Southern congressmen, reportedly shocked at Carver's arriving to testify, were said to have mocked him.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} As he talked about the importance of the peanut and its uses for American agriculture, the committee members repeatedly extended the time for his testimony. The [[Fordney-McCumber Tariff]] of 1922 was passed including one on imported peanuts. Carver's testifying to Congress made him widely known as a public figure.\n\n==Life while famous==\n[[File:George Washington Carver-crop.jpg|right|thumb|United States [[Farm Security Administration]] portrait, March 1942]]\nDuring the last two decades of his life, Carver seemed to enjoy his celebrity status. He was often on the road promoting [[Tuskegee University]], [[peanut]]s, and racial harmony. Although he only published six agricultural bulletins after 1922, he published articles in peanut industry journals and wrote a syndicated newspaper column, \"Professor Carver's Advice\". Business leaders came to seek his help, and he often responded with free advice. Three American presidents\u2014[[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]]\u2014met with him, and the [[Crown Prince]] of [[Sweden]] studied with him for three weeks. From 1923 to 1933, Carver toured white Southern colleges for the [[Commission on Interracial Cooperation]].<ref name=\"Special_History_Study\" />\n\nWith his increasing notability, Carver became the subject of biographies and articles. [[Raleigh H. Merritt]] contacted him for his biography published in 1929. Merritt wrote: \n\n<blockquote>At present not a great deal has been done to utilize Dr. Carver's discoveries commercially. He says that he is merely scratching the surface of scientific investigations of the possibilities of the peanut and other Southern products.<ref name=\"merritt\">Raleigh Howard Merritt.

Heinlein]] for his 1961 [[science fiction]] novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]''.  While the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' summarizes the meaning of ''grok'' as \"to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with\" and \"to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment\",<ref name=OED/> Heinlein's concept is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that \"the book's major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term\".<ref name=CR/>  The concept of ''grok'' garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication.  The term and aspects of the underlying concept have become part of communities as diverse as [[polyamory]] (in particular the [[Church of All Worlds]]) and [[computer science]].\n\n==Descriptions of ''grok'' in ''Stranger in a Strange Land''==\nCritic David E. Wright Sr. points out that in the 1991 \"uncut\" edition of ''Stranger'', the word ''grok'' \"was used first ''without any explicit definition'' on page 22\" and continued to be used without being explicitly defined until page 253 (emphasis in original).<ref name=Wright/>  He notes that this first [[intensional definition]] is simply \"to drink\", but that this is only a metaphor \"much as English 'I see' often means the same as 'I understand'\".<ref name=Wright/>  Critics have bridged this absence of explicit definition by citing passages from ''Stranger'' that illustrate the term.  A selection of these passages follows:\n\n{{quote|''Grok'' means \"to understand,\" of course, but Dr. Mahmoud, who might be termed the leading Terran expert on Martians, explains that it also means, \"to drink\" and \"a hundred other English words, words which we think of as antithetical concepts.  'Grok' means ''all'' of these.  It means 'fear,' it means 'love,' it means 'hate'\u2014proper hate, for by the Martian 'map' you cannot hate anything unless you grok it, understand it so thoroughly that you merge with it and it merges with you\u2014then you can hate it.  By hating yourself.  But this implies that you love it, too, and cherish it and would not have it otherwise.  Then you can ''hate''\u2014and (I think) Martian hate is an emotion so black that the nearest human equivalent could only be called mild distaste.<ref name=McGiveron/>}}\n\n{{quote|'Grok' means 'identically equal.'  The human clich\u00e9 'This hurts me worse than it does you' has a distinctly Martian flavor.  The Martian seems to know instinctively what we learned painfully from modern physics, that observer acts with observed through the process of observation.  'Grok' means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed\u2014to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience.  It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science and it means as little to us as color does to a blind man.\"<ref name=McGiveron/><ref name=Singer/>}}\n\n{{quote|The Martian Race had encountered the people of the fifth planet, grokked them completely, and had taken action; asteroid ruins were all that remained, save that the Martians continued to praise and cherish the people they had destroyed.\"<ref name=McGiveron/>}}\n\n{{quote|All that groks is God.\"<ref name=Berger/>}}\n\n==Etymology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\nRobert A. Heinlein originally [[neologism|coined]] the term ''grok'' in his 1961 novel ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'' as a [[Martian]] word that could not be defined in Earthling terms, but can be associated with various literal meanings such as \"water\", \"to drink\", \"life\", or \"to live\", and had a much more profound figurative meaning that is hard for terrestrial culture to understand because of its assumption of a singular reality.\n\nAccording to the book, drinking water is a central focus on Mars, where it is scarce. Martians use the merging of their bodies with water as a simple example or symbol of how two entities can combine to create a new reality greater than the sum of its parts. The water becomes part of the drinker, and the drinker part of the water. Both ''grok'' each other. Things that once had separate realities become entangled in the same experiences, goals, history, and purpose. Within the book, the statement of [[Divinity|divine]] [[immanence]] verbalized between the main characters, \"[[Thou Art God]]\", is logically derived from the concept inherent in the term ''grok''.\n\nHeinlein describes Martian words as \"guttural\" and \"jarring\". Martian speech is described as sounding \"like a bullfrog fighting a cat\". Accordingly, ''grok'' is generally pronounced as a guttural ''gr'' terminated by a sharp ''k'' with very little or no vowel sound (a narrow [[help:IPA|IPA]] transcription might be {{IPA|[\u0261\u0279\u0329k\u02b0]}}).{{Original research inline|date=January 2018}}\n[[William Tenn]] suggests Heinlein in creating the word might have been influenced by Tenn's very similar concept of ''griggo'', earlier introduced in Tenn's story \"[[Venus and the Seven Sexes]]\" (published in 1949). In his later afterword to the story, Tenn says Heinlein considered such influence \"very possible\".\n\n==Adoption and modern usage==\n\n===In computer programmer culture===\nUses of the word in the decades after the 1960s are more concentrated in [[Cyberculture|computer culture]], such as a 1984 appearance in ''[[InfoWorld]]'': \"There isn't any software! Only different internal states of hardware. It's all hardware! It's a shame programmers don't grok that better.\"\n\nThe [[Jargon File]], which describes itself as a \"Hacker's Dictionary\" and has been published under that name three times, puts ''grok'' in a programming context:\n\n{{quote|When you claim to \"grok\" some knowledge or technique, you are asserting that you have not merely learned it in a detached instrumental way but that it has become part of you, part of your identity. For example, to say that you \"know\" [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] is simply to assert that you can code in it if necessary&nbsp;\u2014 but to say you \"grok\" LISP is to claim that you have deeply entered the world-view and spirit of the language, with the implication that it has transformed your view of programming. Contrast [[zen]], which is a similar supernatural understanding experienced as a single brief flash.}}\n\nThe entry existed in the very earliest forms of the Jargon File, dating from the early 1980s. A typical tech usage from the ''Linux Bible, 2005'' characterizes the [[Unix]] [[software development]] philosophy as \"one that can make your life a lot simpler once you grok the idea\".\n\nThe book ''[[Perl Best Practices]]'' defines ''grok'' as understanding a portion of computer code in a profound way. It goes on to suggest that to ''re-grok'' code is to reload the intricacies of that portion of code into one's memory after some time has passed and all the details of it are no longer remembered. In that sense, ''to grok'' means to load everything into memory for immediate use. It is analogous to the way a processor [[CPU cache|caches]] memory for short term use, but the only implication by this reference was that it was something that a human (or maybe a Martian) would do.\n\nThe main web page for [[cURL]], an open source tool and programming library, describes the function of cURL as \"cURL groks URLs\".<ref name=curl/>\n\nThe book ''[[Cyberia (book)|Cyberia]]'' covers its use in this subculture extensively:\n\n{{quote|This is all latter day usage, the original derivation was from an early text processing utility from so long ago that no one remembers but, grok was the output when it understood the file.

In the [[1989 VFL Grand Final|1989 Grand Final]], Geelong played the man, resulting in major injuries for several Hawks players, Mark Yeates knocking out Dermott Brereton at the opening bounce; Hawthorn controlled the game, leading by approximately 40 points for most of the match; in the last quarter, Geelong almost managed to come from behind to win, but fell short by six points. In [[2008 AFL Grand Final|2008 Grand Final]], Geelong was the heavily backed favourite and had lost only one match for the season, but Hawthorn upset Geelong by 26 points; Geelong won its next eleven matches against Hawthorn over the following five years, under a curse, which was dubbed the \"[[Kennett curse]]\" which was attributed to disrespectful comments made by Hawthorn president [[Jeff Kennett]] following the 2008 Grand Final. It was later revealed that after the 2008 grand final, Paul Chapman initiated a pact between other Geelong players to never lose to Hawthorn again. The curse was broken in a preliminary final in 2013, after Paul Chapman played his final match for Geelong the previous week. Hawthorn went on to win the next three premierships. In 2016 Geelong again defeated Hawthorn in the qualifying final. In 20 matches between the two sides between 2008 and 2017, 12 were decided by less than 10 points, with Geelong victorious in 11 of those 12 close games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://finalsiren.com/PreviousGames.asp?Team1ID=4&Team2ID=16&Go=Go|title=Head to Head Between Geelong and Hawthorn|work=finalsiren.com|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Collingwood ===\nGeelong won their first flag in 1925 over Collingwood, in 1930 Collingwood defeated Geelong in the grand final making it four flags in-a-row for the Pies. Geelong would later deny Collingwood three successive premierships in 1937, winning a famous grand final by 32 points.\n\nThe two sides played against each other in 6 finals between 1951 and 1955, including the 1952 Grand Final when Geelong easily beat Collingwood by 46 points. In 1953, Collingwood ended Geelong's record 23-game winning streak in the home and away season, and later defeated them by 12 points in the grand final, denying the Cats a third successive premiership.\n\nSince 2007, the clubs have again both been at the top of the ladder and have met regularly in finals. Geelong won a memorable preliminary final by five points on their way to their first flag in 44 years. In 2008, Collingwood inflicted Geelong's only home-and-away loss, by a massive 86 points, but the teams did not meet in the finals. They would meet in preliminary finals in 2009 and 2010, each winning one ''en route'' to a premiership. They finally met in a Grand Final in 2011, which Geelong won by 38 points; Geelong inflicted Collingwood's only three losses for the 2011 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collingwoodfc.com.au/news/2013-05-14/an-epic-rivalry|title=An epic rivalry|website=collingwoodfc.com.au|accessdate=21 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Corporate ==\n=== Sponsorship ===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2018}}\n\n=== Supporter base ===\n[[File:Geelong Cats supporters.jpg|thumb|right|550px|Geelong's supporters came out in force in the [[2009 AFL Grand Final|2009 Grand Final]] against St Kilda]]\n[[File:Geelong FC's one-man cheer squad.jpg|thumb|Well-known supporter Troy West, nicknamed \"Catman\"]]\n[[File:Geelong Cats Banner 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Geelong players prepare to break a banner, which is created by its supporters, before a match against {{AFL GWS}} in June 2013.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Table of club membership, with home attendance figures (since 1984)\n|-\n!

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]], and from 1992 to 1999 a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]]. The Geelong Football Club fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for Geelong in the lower grade. During that time, the Geelong reserves team won thirteen premierships (1923, 1924, 1930, 1937, 1938, 1948, 1960, 1963, 1964, 1975, 1980, 1981, 1982), the most of any club.\n\nSince the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the Geelong reserves team has competed in the new [[Victorian Football League]], having won three premierships in that time. Unlike all other Victorian AFL clubs, Geelong has never operated in a [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliation]] with an existing VFL club, having instead operated its stand-alone reserves team continuously. The team is composed of both reserves players from the club's primary and rookie AFL lists, and a separately maintained list of players eligible only for VFL matches. Home games are played at [[Simonds Stadium]], with some played as curtain-raisers to senior AFL matches.\n\n* Premierships (3): 2002, 2007, 2012\n* Runners-ups (2): 2006, 2013\n* Minor premierships (2): 2002, 2013\n* Wooden spoons (1): 2005\n\n== AFL Women's team ==\nIn 2017, following the inaugural [[AFL Women's]] (AFLW) season, Geelong was among eight clubs that applied for licenses to enter

One of the aims of Galileo is to provide an independent high-precision positioning system so European nations do not have to rely on the Russian [[GLONASS]],  Chinese [[BeiDou Navigation Satellite System|BeiDou]] or U.S. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] systems, which could be disabled or degraded by their operators at any time.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.esa.int/esaNA/GGG0H750NDC_galileo_0.html |title= Why Europe needs Galileo |publisher=[[European Space Agency|ESA]] |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=21 June 2014}}</ref>\nThe use of basic (lower-precision) Galileo services will be free and open to everyone.

The starting cost for the period ending in 2005 is estimated at \u20ac1.1&nbsp;billion. The required satellites (the planned number is 30) were to be launched between 2011 and 2014, with the system up and running and under civilian control from 2019. The final cost is estimated at \u20ac3&nbsp;billion, including the infrastructure on [[Earth]], constructed in 2006 and 2007. The plan was for private companies and investors to invest at least two-thirds of the cost of implementation, with the EU and ESA dividing the remaining cost. The base ''Open Service'' is to be available without charge to anyone with a Galileo-compatible [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]], with an encrypted higher-bandwidth improved-precision ''Commercial Service'' available at a cost.

Initially [[GPS]] reserved the highest quality signal for military use, and the signal available for civilian use was intentionally degraded ([[Selective Availability]]). This changed with President [[Bill Clinton]] signing a policy directive in 1996 to turn off Selective Availability. Since May 2000 the same precision signal has been provided to both civilians and the military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |title=GPS & Selective Availability Q&A |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=May 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921115614/http://ngs.woc.noaa.gov/FGCS/info/sans_SA/docs/GPS_SA_Event_QAs.pdf |archivedate=September 21, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nSince Galileo was designed to provide the highest possible precision (greater than GPS) to anyone, the US was concerned that an enemy could use Galileo signals in military strikes against the US and its allies (some weapons like missiles use GNSSs for guidance). The frequency initially chosen for Galileo would have made it impossible for the US to block the Galileo signals without also interfering with its own GPS signals. The US did not want to lose their GNSS capability with GPS while denying enemies the use of GNSS. Some US officials became especially concerned when Chinese interest in Galileo was reported.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_12_13/ai_n27579865 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628141723/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BPW/is_12_13/ai_n27579865 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-06-28 |title=EU, U.S. split over Galileo M-code overlay |date=December 2002 |publisher=GPS World.

At first, EU officials did not want to change their original plans for Galileo, but have since reached the compromise that Galileo is to use a different frequency.

The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a [[nanosecond]] or 1 billionth of a second (10<sup>\u22129</sup> or <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1,000,000,000</sub> s) translates into a {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on|1|lk=on}} positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate the time that it takes the signal to reach it.<ref name=\"Galileo\u2019s clocks\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/Galileo/Galileo_s_clocks|title=Galileo's clocks|publisher=European Space Agency|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"About errors\">{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Navigation/What_about_errors|title=What about errors|publisher=European Space Agency|access-date=16 January 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"clock failures\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-38664225|title=Galileo satellites experiencing multiple clock failures|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)|date=17 January 2017|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the navigation signal is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the navigation signal generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by [[Trilateration|trilaterating]] the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.\n\nThe onboard passive hydrogen maser and rubidium clocks are very stable over a few hours. If they were left to run indefinitely, though, their timekeeping would drift, so they need to be synchronized regularly with a network of even more stable ground-based reference clocks. These include active hydrogen maser clocks and clocks based on the caesium frequency standard, which show a far better medium and long-term stability than rubidium or passive hydrogen maser clocks. These clocks on the ground are gathered together within the parallel functioning Precise Timing Facilities in the Fucino and Oberpfaffhofen Galileo Control Centres. The ground based clocks also generate a worldwide time reference called Galileo System Time (GST), the standard for the Galileo system and are routinely compared to the local realizations of UTC, the UTC(k) of the European frequency and time laboratories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectratime.com/uploads/pdfs/gstpg_ptti06.pdf|title=38th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Meeting GALILEO SYSTEM TIME PHYSICAL GENERATION|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nFor more information of the concept of global satellite navigation systems, see [[GNSS]] and [[GNSS positioning calculation]].\n\n== Search and rescue ==\nGalileo is to provide a new global [[search and rescue]] (SAR) function as part of the [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme#MEOSAR|MEOSAR system]].

Well into the 19th century, the district of Washington Square was considered separate from Greenwich Village.\n\n==={{anchor|Urban Bohemia}}Reputation as urban bohemia===\n{{further|LGBTQ culture in New York City}}\n[[File:Gay street.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Gay Street (Manhattan)|Gay Street]] at the corner of Waverly Place]]\nGreenwich Village historically was known as an important landmark on the map of American [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] culture in the early and mid-20th century. The neighborhood was known for its colorful, artistic residents and the alternative culture they propagated. Due in part to the progressive attitudes of many of its residents, the Village was a focal point of new movements and ideas, whether political, artistic, or cultural. This tradition as an enclave of [[avant-garde]] and [[alternative culture]] was established during the 19th century and continued into the 20th century, when small presses, art galleries, and experimental theater thrived.\n\nThe [[Tenth Street Studio Building]] was situated at 51 West 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, the building was commissioned by James Boorman Johnston{{efn|James Boorman Johnston (1822\u20131887) was a son of the prominent Scottish-born New York merchant John Johnston, in partnership with James Boorman (1783\u20131866) as Boorman & Johnston, developers of [[Washington Square Park, New York|Washington Square North]], and a founder of [[New York University]]; a group portrait of the Johnston Children 1831, is at the [[Museum of the City of New York]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Johnston Children: John Taylor Johnston (1820-1893), James Boorman Johnston (1822-1887), Margaret Taylor Johnston (1825-1875), and Emily Proudfoot Johnston (1827-1831), (painting) |url=https://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!43361!0 |publisher=SIRIS}}</ref>}} and designed by [[Richard Morris Hunt]]. Its innovative design soon represented a national architectural prototype, and featured a domed central gallery, from which interconnected rooms radiated. Hunt's studio within the building housed the first architectural school in the United States. Soon after its completion in 1857, the building helped to make Greenwich Village central to the arts in New York City, drawing artists from all over the country to work, exhibit, and sell their art.

Located at 38 Commerce Street, it is New York City's oldest continuously running [[Off-Broadway]] theater. A landmark in Greenwich Village's cultural landscape, it was built as a farm silo in 1817, and also served as a tobacco warehouse and box factory before [[Edna St. Vincent Millay]] and other members of the [[Provincetown Players]] converted the structure into a theatre they christened the Cherry Lane Playhouse, which opened on March 24, 1924, with the play ''The Man Who Ate the Popomack''. During the 1940s [[The Living Theatre]], [[Theatre of the Absurd]], and the Downtown Theater movement all took root there, and it developed a reputation as a showcase for aspiring [[playwright]]s and emerging voices.\n\nIn one of the many Manhattan properties that [[Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney]] and her husband owned, Gertrude Whitney established the ''Whitney Studio Club'' at 8 West 8th Street in 1914, as a facility where young artists could exhibit their works.

The Whitney was founded in 1931, as an answer to the [[Museum of Modern Art]], founded 1928, and its collection of mostly European [[modernism]] and its neglect of [[United States|American Art]].

Fleeing from what they saw as oppressive social conformity, a loose collection of writers, poets, artists, and students (later known as the [[Beat generation|Beats]]) and the [[Beatniks]], moved to Greenwich Village, and to [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]] in [[San Francisco]], in many ways creating the east-coast and west-coast predecessors respectively to the [[Haight-Ashbury]]-[[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] [[Hippy|hippie scene]] of the next decade. The Village (and surrounding New York City) would later play central roles in the writings of, among others, [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Marianne Moore]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Rod McKuen]], and [[Dylan Thomas]], who collapsed at the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] and died at [[Saint Vincent's Catholic Medical Center|St. Vincents Hospital]] at 170 West 12th Street, in the Village after drinking at the [[White Horse Tavern (New York City)|White Horse Tavern]] on November 5, 1953.\n\n[[Off-Off-Broadway]] began in Greenwich Village in 1958 as a reaction to [[Off Broadway]], and a \"complete rejection of commercial theatre\".<ref>Viagas (2004, p. 72)</ref> Among the first venues for what would soon be called \"Off-Off-Broadway\" (a term supposedly coined by [[critic]] Jerry Tallmer of the ''[[Village Voice]]'') were coffeehouses in Greenwich Village, in particular, the [[Caffe Cino]] at 31 Cornelia Street, operated by the eccentric [[Joe Cino]], who early on took a liking to actors and playwrights and agreed to let them stage plays there without bothering to read the plays first, or to even find out much about the content. Also integral to the rise of Off-Off-Broadway were [[Ellen Stewart]] at [[La MaMa, E.T.C.|La MaMa]], originally located at 321 E. 9th Street, and [[Al Carmines]] at the Judson Poets' Theater, located at [[Judson Memorial Church]] on the south side of [[Washington Square Park]].\n\n[[File:Blue Note Jazz Club, New York City.jpg|thumb|[[Blue Note Jazz Club]]]]\nThe Village had a cutting-edge cabaret and music scene. ''[[The Village Gate]]'', the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'', and ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]]'' (since 1981), regularly hosted some of the biggest names in [[jazz]]. Greenwich Village also played a major role in the development of the [[American folk music revival|folk music scene]] of the 1960s. Music clubs included ''[[Gerde's Folk City]]'', ''[[The Bitter End]],'' ''[[Cafe Au Go Go]]'', ''[[Cafe Wha?]]'', ''[[The Gaslight Cafe]]'' and ''[[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]]''. Three of the four members of [[the Mamas & the Papas]] met there. Guitarist and folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]] lived there for many years. Village resident and cultural icon [[Bob Dylan]] by the mid-60s had become one of the world's foremost popular songwriters, and often developments in Greenwich Village would influence the simultaneously occurring [[folk rock]] movement in [[San Francisco]] and elsewhere, and vice versa. Dozens of other cultural and popular icons got their start in the Village's nightclub, theater, and coffeehouse scene during the 1950s, 1960s, and early 1970s, including [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Bette Midler]], [[the Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Simon & Garfunkel]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[James Taylor]], [[Eric Andersen]], [[Joan Baez]], [[the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]], [[the Velvet Underground]], [[the Kingston Trio]], [[Carly Simon]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Maria Muldaur]], [[Tom Paxton]], [[Janis Ian]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Laura Nyro]], and [[Nina Simone]]. The Greenwich Village of the 1950s and 1960s was at the center of [[Jane Jacobs]]'s book ''[[The Death and Life of Great American Cities]]'', which defended it and similar communities, while criticizing common [[urban renewal]] policies of the time.\n\nFounded by New York-based artist [[Mercedes Matter]] and her students, the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]] is an art school formed in the mid-1960s in the Village. Officially opened September 23, 1964, the school is still active, at 8 W. 8th Street, the site of the original [[Whitney Museum of American Art]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp|title=New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture: The School: Its History|last1=Matter|first1=Mercedes|date=2002|website=nyss.org|publisher=New York Studio School|access-date=February 27, 2016|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426072430/http://www.nyss.org/schoolhistory.asp|archivedate=April 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nGreenwich Village was home to a safe house used by the radical [[anti-war movement]] known as the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]].

The [[Stonewall riots]] were a series of spontaneous, violent demonstrations by members of the [[LGBT community|gay community]] against a [[police raid]] that took place in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the [[Stonewall Inn]], 53 [[Christopher Street (Manhattan)|Christopher Street]].

Shortly after the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) was established in 1965, it acted to protect parts of Greenwich Village, designating the small [[Charlton-King-Vandam Historic District]] in 1966, which contains the city's largest concentration of row houses in the Federal style, as well as a significant concentration of Greek Revival houses, and the even smaller [[MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District]] in 1967, a group of 22 houses sharing a common back garden, built in the Greek Revival style and later renovated with Colonial Revival fa\u00e7ades. In 1969, the LPC designated the Greenwich Village Historic District \u2014 for four decades, the city's largest \u2014 despite preservationists' advocacy for the entire neighborhood to be designated an historic district. Advocates continued to pursue their goal of additional designation, spurred in particular by the increased pace of development in the 1990s.\n\n====Rezoned areas====\n[[File:Jefferson market.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Jefferson Market Library]], once a courthouse, now serves as a branch of the [[New York Public Library]].]]\nThe [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP), a [[nonprofit organization]] dedicated to the architectural and cultural character and heritage of the neighborhood, successfully proposed new districts and individual landmarks to the LPC.

Since the 1830s, [[New York University]] (NYU) has had a campus there. In 1973 NYU moved its campus in the [[University Heights, Bronx|University Heights]] section of the [[West Bronx]] to Greenwich Village. In 1976 [[Yeshiva University]] established the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] in the northern part of Greenwich Village. In the 1980s [[Hebrew Union College]] was built in Greenwich Village. [[The New School]], with its [[Parsons The New School for Design]], a division of The New School, and the School's Graduate School expanded in the 2000s, with the renovated, award-winning design of the Sheila C. Johnson Design Center at 66 Fifth Avenue on 13th Street. The [[Cooper Union]] is located in Greenwich Village, at [[Astor Place]], near [[St. Mark's Place]] on the border of the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]. [[Pratt Institute]] established its latest Manhattan campus in an [[adaptive reuse|adaptively reused]] [[Arnold Brunner|Brunner & Tryon]]-designed loft building on 14th Street, east of Seventh Avenue. The university campus building expansion was followed by a [[gentrification]] process in the 1980s.\n[[File:ChristopherPark3358.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Christopher Park, part of the [[Stonewall National Monument]]<ref name=StonewallNationalMonument1/>]]\nThe historic [[Washington Square Park]] is the center and heart of the neighborhood. Additionally, the Village has several other, smaller parks: Christopher, Father Fagan, Minetta Triangle, Petrosino Square, Little Red Square, and Time Landscape. There are also city playgrounds, including [[DeSalvio Playground]], Minetta, [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]], Bleecker Street, Downing Street, Mercer Street, Cpl. John A. Seravelli, and William Passannante Ballfield. Perhaps the most famous, though, is \"The Cage\", officially known as the [[West Fourth Street Courts]]. Sitting atop the [[West Fourth Street \u2013 Washington Square (New York City Subway)|West Fourth Street \u2013 Washington Square]] subway station ({{NYCS West 4th}} trains) at Sixth Avenue, the courts are easily accessible to [[basketball]] and [[American handball]] players from all over New York. The Cage has become one of the most important tournament sites for the citywide \"[[Streetball]]\" amateur basketball tournament. Since 1975, New York University's art collection has been housed at the [[Grey Art Gallery]] bordering Washington Square Park, at 100 Washington Square East. The Grey Art Gallery is notable for its museum-quality exhibitions of contemporary art.\n\nThe Village has a bustling performing arts scene. It is home to many [[Off Broadway]] and [[Off-Off-Broadway]] theaters; for instance, ''[[Blue Man Group]]'' has taken up residence in the Astor Place Theater. ''[[The Village Gate]]'' (until 1992), the ''[[Village Vanguard]]'' and ''[[Blue Note Jazz Club|The Blue Note]]'' are still presenting some of the biggest names in [[jazz]] on a regular basis. Other music clubs include ''[[The Bitter End]],'' and ''[[Lion's Den (nightclub)|Lion's Den]]''. The village has its own orchestra aptly named the ''[[Greenwich Village Orchestra]]''. Comedy clubs dot the Village as well, including ''[[Comedy Cellar]]'', where many American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] comedians got their start.\n\nSeveral publications have offices in the Village, most notably the citywide newsweekly ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and the monthly magazines ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''.

In addition to comedies and political satire, he wrote several musicals, notably for the [[Marx Brothers]]. One play and one musical that he wrote won the [[Pulitzer Prize]] for Drama: ''[[You Can't Take It with You (play)|You Can't Take It with You]]'' (1937, with [[Moss Hart]]), and ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'' (1932, with [[Morrie Ryskind]] and [[Ira Gershwin]]). He also won the [[Tony Award]] as a Director, for the musical ''[[Guys and Dolls (musical)|Guys and Dolls]]''.\n\n==Early years==\nGeorge S. Kaufman was born to Joseph S. Kaufman, a hatband manufacturer,<ref name=\"1910 United States Federal Census\">1910 United States Federal Census</ref> and Nettie Meyers<ref>U.S., Social Security Applications and Claims Index, 1936-2007</ref> in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].

His most successful of such efforts include two Broadway shows crafted for the Marx Brothers, ''[[The Cocoanuts (musical)|The Cocoanuts]]'', written with [[Irving Berlin]], and ''[[Animal Crackers (musical)|Animal Crackers]]'', written with [[Morrie Ryskind]], [[Bert Kalmar]], and [[Harry Ruby]]. According to Charlotte Chandler, \"By the time ''Animal Crackers'' opened ... the Marx Brothers were becoming famous enough to interest Hollywood. Paramount signed them to a contract\".<ref>Chandler, Charlotte (2007). ''Hello, I Must Be Going: Groucho and His Friends'', Simon and Schuster, {{ISBN|1-4165-6521-3}}.</ref>  Kaufman was one of the writers who excelled in writing intelligent nonsense for [[Groucho Marx]], a process that was collaborative, given Groucho's skills at expanding upon the scripted material. Though the Marx Brothers were notoriously critical of their writers, Groucho and [[Harpo Marx]] expressed admiration and gratitude towards Kaufman. [[Dick Cavett]], introducing Groucho onstage at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1972, told the audience that Groucho considered Kaufman to be \"his god\".\n\nWhile ''The Cocoanuts'' was being developed in Atlantic City, Irving Berlin was hugely enthusiastic about a song he had written for the show. Kaufman was less enthusiastic, and refused to rework the libretto to include this number. The discarded song was \"[[Always (1925 song)|Always]]\", ultimately a huge hit for Berlin, recorded by many popular performers. According to Laurence Bergreen, \"Kaufman's lack of enthusiasm caused Irving to lose confidence in the song, and 'Always' was deleted from the score of ''The Cocoanuts'' \u2013 though not from its creator's memory. ... Kaufman, a confirmed misogynist, had had no use for the song in ''The Cocoanuts'' but his disapproval did not deter Berlin from saving it for a more important occasion.\"<ref>Bergreen, Laurence  (1996). ''As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin'', Da Capo Press, {{ISBN|0-306-80675-4}}, pp. 249, 264.</ref> ''The Cocoanuts'' would remain Irving Berlin's only Broadway musical \u2013 until his last one, ''[[Mr. President (musical)|Mr. President]]'' \u2013 that did not include at least one eventual hit song.\n\nHumor derived from political situations was of particular interest to Kaufman. He collaborated on the hit musical ''[[Of Thee I Sing]]'', which won the 1932 Pulitzer Prize, the first musical so honored,<ref name=pulitzer/> and its sequel ''[[Let 'Em Eat Cake]]'', as well as one troubled but eventually successful satire that had several incarnations, ''[[Strike Up the Band (musical)|Strike Up the Band]]''. Working with Kaufman on these ventures were Ryskind, [[George Gershwin]], and [[Ira Gershwin]]. Also, Kaufman, with Moss Hart, wrote the book to ''[[I'd Rather Be Right]]'', a musical starring [[George M. Cohan]] as [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (the U.S. President at the time), with songs by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]]. He also co-wrote the 1935 comedy-drama ''[[First Lady (play)|First Lady]]''.  In 1945, Kaufman adapted ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' into ''[[Hollywood Pinafore]]''.\n\nKaufman also contributed to major New York revues, including ''[[The Band Wagon (musical)|The Band Wagon]]'' (which shared songs but not plot with the 1953 film version) with [[Arthur Schwartz]] and [[Howard Dietz]]. His often anthologized sketch \"The Still Alarm\" from the revue ''[[The Little Show]]'' lasted long after the show closed. Another well-known sketch of his is \"If Men Played Cards As Women Do.\" There have also been musicals based on Kaufman properties, such as the 1981 musical version of ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', adapted by [[George Furth]] and [[Stephen Sondheim]].<ref>Rich, Frank (November 17, 1981).

He also occasionally wrote directly for the movies, most significantly the screenplay for ''[[A Night at the Opera (film)|A Night at the Opera]]'' for the Marx Brothers. His only credit as a [[film director]] was ''[[The Senator Was Indiscreet]]'' (1947) starring William Powell.\n\nFrom 1949 until midway through the 1952\u20131953 season, he appeared as a panelist on the [[CBS]] [[television series]] ''[[This Is Show Business]]''.<ref>McNeil, Alex.

From the 1920s through the 1950s, Kaufman was as well known for his personality as he was for his writing.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In the [[Moss Hart]] autobiography ''Act One'', Hart portrayed Kaufman as a morose and intimidating figure, uncomfortable with any expressions of affection between human beings\u2014in life or on the page.

N. Lewis was born in 1875 in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]]. After receiving his PhD in [[chemistry]] from [[Harvard University]] and studying abroad in Germany and the [[Philippines]], Lewis moved to [[California]] to teach chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Several years later, he became the Dean of the college of Chemistry at Berkeley, where he spent the rest of his life. As a professor, he incorporated thermodynamic principles into the chemistry curriculum and reformed [[chemical thermodynamics]] in a mathematically rigorous manner accessible to ordinary chemists. He began measuring the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] values related to several chemical processes, both organic and inorganic.\n\nIn 1916, he also proposed his theory of bonding and added information about electrons in the [[periodic table]] of the [[chemical element]]s. In 1933, he started his research on isotope separation. Lewis worked with hydrogen and managed to purify a sample of [[heavy water]]. He then came up with his theory of acids and bases, and did work in photochemistry during the last years of his life. In 1926, Lewis coined the term \"[[photon]]\" for the smallest unit of radiant energy. He was a brother in [[Alpha Chi Sigma]], the professional chemistry fraternity.\n\nThough he was nominated 41 times,<ref name=\"NobelPrize\">{{cite web|title=Nomination Database  Gilbert N. Lewis|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=5441|website=NobelPrize.org|accessdate=10 May 2016}}</ref> G. N. Lewis never won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. On March 23, 1946, Lewis was found dead in his Berkeley laboratory where he had been working with [[hydrogen cyanide]]; many postulated that the cause of his death was suicide. After Lewis' death, his children followed their father's career in chemistry.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nLewis was born in 1875 and raised in [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where there exists a street named for him, G.N. Lewis Way, off Summer Street.  Additionally, the wing of the new Weymouth High School Chemistry department has been named in his honor. Lewis received his primary education at home from his parents, Frank Wesley Lewis, a lawyer of independent character, and Mary Burr White Lewis. He read at age three and was intellectually precocious. In 1884 his family moved to [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], and in 1889 he received his first formal education at the university preparatory school.\n\nIn 1893, after two years at the [[University of Nebraska]], Lewis transferred to [[Harvard University]], where he obtained his [[B.S.]] in 1896. After a year of teaching at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]], Lewis returned to Harvard to study with the physical chemist [[Theodore William Richards|T. W. Richards]] and obtained his Ph.D. in 1899 with a dissertation on [[electrochemical potential]]s.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After a year of teaching at Harvard, Lewis took a traveling fellowship to Germany, the center of [[physical chemistry]], and studied with [[Walther Nernst]] at [[G\u00f6ttingen]] and with [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] at [[Leipzig]].<ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Edsall\n|first=J.

In the following years, Lewis started to criticize and denounce his former teacher on many occasions, calling Nernst's work on his heat theorem \"''a regrettable episode in the history of chemistry''\".<ref>[http://listverse.com/2015/04/07/10-fierce-but-productive-rivalries-between-dueling-scientists/ ''10 Fierce (But Productive) Rivalries Between Dueling Scientists''] Radu Alexander.

There is evidence that he used the Nobel nominating and reporting procedures to block a [[Nobel Prize]] for Lewis in [[thermodynamics]] by nominating Lewis for the prize three times, and then using his position as a committee member to write negative reports.<ref>Coffey (2008): 195-207.</ref>\n\n===Harvard, Manila, and MIT===\nAfter his stay in Nernst's lab, Lewis returned to Harvard in 1901 as an instructor for three more years. He was appointed instructor in [[thermodynamics]] and [[electrochemistry]]. In 1904 Lewis was granted a leave of absence and became Superintendent of Weights and Measures for the Bureau of Science in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. The next year he returned to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] when the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) appointed him to a faculty position, in which he had a chance to join a group of outstanding physical chemists under the direction of [[Arthur Amos Noyes]]. He became an assistant professor in 1907, associate professor in 1908, and full professor in 1911. He left MIT in 1912 to become a professor of physical chemistry and dean of the [[Berkeley College of Chemistry|College of Chemistry]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Lewis Hall at Berkeley, built in 1948, is named in his honor.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nMost of Lewis\u2019 lasting interests originated during his Harvard years. The most important was thermodynamics, a subject in which Richards was very active at that time. Although most of the important thermodynamic relations were known by 1895, they were seen as isolated equations, and had not yet been rationalized as a logical system, from which, given one relation, the rest could be derived. Moreover, these relations were inexact, applying only to ideal chemical systems. These were two outstanding problems of theoretical thermodynamics. In two long and ambitious theoretical papers in 1900 and 1901, Lewis tried to provide a solution. Lewis introduced the thermodynamic concept of [[activity (chemistry)|activity]] and coined the term \"[[fugacity]]\".<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = G.N. | year = 1908 | title = The osmotic pressure of concentrated solutions, and the laws of the perfect solution | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 30 | issue = 5| pages = 668\u2013683 | doi=10.1021/ja01947a002}}</ref> His new idea of fugacity, or \"escaping tendency\", was a function with the dimensions of [[pressure]] which expressed the tendency of a substance to pass from one chemical phase to another. Lewis believed that fugacity was the fundamental principle from which a system of real thermodynamic relations could be derived. This hope was not realized, though fugacity did find a lasting place in the description of real gases.\n\nLewis\u2019 early papers also reveal an unusually advanced awareness of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. W. Gibbs\u2019s]] and [[Pierre Duhem|P. Duhem\u2019s]] ideas of free energy and [[thermodynamic potential]]. These ideas were well known to physicists and mathematicians, but not to most practical chemists, who regarded them as abstruse and inapplicable to chemical systems. Most chemists relied on the familiar thermodynamics of heat (enthalpy) of [[Marcellin Berthelot|Berthelot]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald|Ostwald]], and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|Van\u2019t Hoff]], and the [[calorimetry|calorimetric]] school. Heat of reaction is not, of course, a measure of the tendency of chemical changes to occur, and Lewis realized that only free energy and entropy could provide an exact chemical thermodynamics. He derived free energy from fugacity; he tried, without success, to obtain an exact expression for the [[entropy]] function, which in 1901 had not been defined at low temperatures. Richards too tried and failed, and not until Nernst succeeded in 1907 was it possible to calculate entropies unambiguously. Although Lewis\u2019 fugacity-based system did not last, his early interest in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] and entropy proved most fruitful, and much of his career was devoted to making these useful concepts accessible to practical chemists.\n\nAt Harvard, Lewis also wrote a theoretical paper on the thermodynamics of [[blackbody radiation]] in which he postulated that light has a pressure. He later revealed that he had been discouraged from pursuing this idea by his older, more conservative colleagues, who were unaware that [[Wilhelm Wien]] and others were successfully pursuing the same line of thought. Lewis\u2019 paper remained unpublished; but his interest in radiation and [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], and (later) in [[theory of relativity|relativity]], sprang from this early, aborted effort. From the start of his career, Lewis regarded himself as both chemist and physicist.\n\n===Valence theory===\n[[Image:Lewis-cubic-notes.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Lewis' '''[[cubical atom]]s''' (as drawn in 1902)]]\n\nAbout 1902 Lewis started to use unpublished drawings of [[cubical atom]]s in his lecture notes, in which the corners of the cube represented possible [[electron]] positions. Lewis later cited these notes in his classic 1916 paper on chemical bonding, as being the first expression of his ideas.\n\nA third major interest that originated during Lewis\u2019 Harvard years was his valence theory. In 1902, while trying to explain the laws of valence to his students, Lewis conceived the idea that atoms were built up of a concentric series of cubes with electrons at each corner. This \u201ccubic atom\u201d explained the cycle of eight elements in the periodic table and was in accord with the widely accepted belief that chemical bonds were formed by transfer of electrons to give each atom a complete set of eight. This electrochemical theory of valence found its most elaborate expression in the work of [[Richard Abegg]] in 1904, but Lewis\u2019 version of this theory was the only one to be embodied in a concrete atomic model. Again Lewis\u2019 theory did not interest his Harvard mentors, who, like most American chemists of that time, had no taste for such speculation. Lewis did not publish his theory of the cubic atom, but in 1916 it became an important part of his theory of the shared electron pair bond.\n\nIn 1916, he published his classic paper on chemical bonding \"''The Atom and the Molecule''\"<ref>[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/bond/papers/corr216.3-lewispub-19160400.html Lewis G.N. (1916) The atom and the molecule. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. Vol. 38, no. 4.]</ref> in which he formulated the idea of what would become known as the [[covalent bond]], consisting of a [[shared pair]] of electrons, and he defined the term odd molecule (the modern term is [[free radical]]) when an electron is not shared. He included what became known as [[Lewis structure|Lewis dot structure]]s as well as the [[cubical atom]] model. These ideas on [[chemical bond]]ing were expanded upon by [[Irving Langmuir]] and became the inspiration for the studies on the nature of the chemical bond by [[Linus Pauling]].\n\n===Relativity===\nIn 1908 he published the first of several papers on [[theory of relativity|relativity]], in which he derived the [[mass]]-[[energy]] relationship in a different way from [[Albert Einstein]]'s derivation.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|author=Lewis, G.

He resigned in 1934, refusing to state the cause for his resignation; it has been speculated that it was due to a dispute over the internal politics of that institution or to the failure of those he had nominated to be elected. His decision to resign may have been sparked by resentment over the award of the 1934 Nobel Prize for chemistry to his student, [[Harold Urey]], for the discovery of [[deuterium]], a prize Lewis almost certainly felt he should have shared for his work on purification and characterization of [[heavy water]].<ref>Coffey (2008): 221-22.</ref>\n\n===Acids and bases===\n{{Main|Lewis acids and bases}}\n\nIn 1923, he formulated the electron-pair theory of [[acid\u2013base reaction]]s. In this theory of [[acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|base]]s, a \"Lewis acid\" is an ''electron-pair acceptor'' and a \"Lewis base\" is an ''electron-pair donor''. This year he also published a monograph on his theories of the chemical bond<ref>Lewis, G. N. (1926) ''Valence and the Nature of the Chemical Bond''. Chemical Catalog Company.</ref>\n\nBased on work by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]], it was known that chemical reactions proceeded to an [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] determined by the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the substances taking part. Lewis spent 25 years determining free energies of various substances. In 1923 he and [[Merle Randall]] published the results of this study,<ref>Lewis, G. N. and [[Merle Randall]] (1923) ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energies of Chemical Substances''.

Seaborg]], who was retained for post-doctoral work as Lewis' personal research assistant. Seaborg went on to win the 1951 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry and have the element [[seaborgium]] named in his honor while he was still alive.\n\n===Other achievements===\nIn 1921, Lewis was the first to propose an empirical equation describing the failure of [[strong electrolyte]]s to obey the [[law of mass action]], a problem that had perplexed physical chemists for twenty years. His empirical equations for what he called [[ionic strength]] were later confirmed to be in accord with the [[Debye\u2013H\u00fcckel equation]] for strong electrolytes, published in 1923.\n\nIn 1924, by studying the [[magnetism|magnetic]] properties of solutions of [[oxygen]] in [[liquid]] [[nitrogen]], he found that O<sub>4</sub> molecules were formed.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The magnetism of oxygen and the molecule O<sub>4</sub>|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja01674a008|journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|date = 1924-09-01|issn = 0002-7863|pages = 2027\u20132032|volume = 46|issue = 9|doi = 10.1021/ja01674a008|first = Gilbert N.|last = Lewis}}</ref> This was the first evidence for [[tetraoxygen|tetratomic oxygen]].\n\nIn 1926, he coined the term \"[[photon]]\" for the smallest unit of radiant energy (light). Actually, the outcome of his letter  <ref>\n{{cite journal\n | author = Lewis, G.N. \n | title = The conservation of photons\n | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]\n | year = 1926 |url=http://www.nobeliefs.com/photon.htm\n | volume = 118 | pages = 874\u2013875\n | doi = 10.1038/118874a0\n|bibcode = 1926Natur.118..874L\n | issue=2981}}</ref> to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' was not what he had intended. In the letter, he proposed a photon being a structural element, not [[energy]]. He insisted on the need for a new variable, ''the number of photons''. Although his theory differed from the [[photon|quantum theory of light]] introduced by [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905, his name was adopted for what Einstein had called a '''light quantum''' (Lichtquant in German).\n\n===Later years===\nOver the course of his career, Lewis published on many other subjects besides those mentioned in this entry, ranging from the nature of [[light]] quanta to the [[economics]] of price stabilization. \nIn the last years of his life, Lewis and graduate student [[Michael Kasha]], his last research associate, established that [[phosphorescence]] of [[organic chemistry|organic]] molecules involves emission of light from one electron in an excited [[triplet state]] (a state in which two electrons have their [[Spin (physics)|spin vector]]s oriented in the ''same'' direction, but in different orbitals) and measured the [[paramagnetism]] of this triplet state.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01240a030 | volume=66 | issue=12 | title=Phosphorescence and the Triplet State | year=1944 | journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society | pages=2100\u20132116 | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Gilbert N. | last2 = Kasha | first2 = M.}}</ref>\n\nIn 1946, a graduate student found Lewis's lifeless body under a laboratory workbench at Berkeley. Lewis had been working on an experiment with liquid [[hydrogen cyanide]], and deadly fumes from a broken line had leaked into the laboratory. The coroner ruled that the cause of death was [[coronary artery disease]], because of a lack of any signs of cyanosis,<ref name=\"Coffey\">Coffey (2008): 310-15.</ref>  but some believe that it may have been a suicide. Berkeley Emeritus Professor William Jolly, who reported the various views on Lewis's death in his 1987 history of UC Berkeley\u2019s College of Chemistry, ''From Retorts to Lasers'', wrote that a higher-up in the department believed that Lewis had committed suicide.\n\nIf Lewis's death was indeed a suicide, a possible explanation was depression brought on by a lunch with [[Irving Langmuir]]. Langmuir and Lewis had a long rivalry, dating back to Langmuir's extensions of Lewis's theory of the chemical bond. Langmuir had been awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his work on [[surface chemistry]], while Lewis had not received the Prize despite having been nominated 41 times.<ref name=\"NobelPrize\"/> On the day of Lewis's death, Langmuir and Lewis had met for lunch at Berkeley, a meeting that Michael Kasha recalled only years later.<ref name=\"Coffey\" /> Associates reported that Lewis came back from lunch in a dark mood, played a morose game of bridge with some colleagues, then went back to work in his lab. An hour later, he was found dead. Langmuir's papers at the [[Library of Congress]] confirm that he had been on the Berkeley campus that day to receive an honorary degree.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn June 21, 1912, he married Mary Hinckley Sheldon, daughter of a Harvard professor of [[Romance languages]]. They had two sons, both of whom became chemistry professors, and a daughter.\n\n==See also==\n{{wikisource author}}\n*[[History of molecular theory]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Coffey, Patrick (2008) ''Cathedrals of Science: The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry''.

The current [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is [[Rick Snyder]], a member of the [[Republican Party (Michigan)|Republican Party]], who was inaugurated on January 1, 2011, as the state's 48th governor, was re-elected November 4, 2014, and was sworn in for a second term on January 1, 2015. He is not eligible for a third term under Michigan's [[term limits]], which limit a governor to only two, four-year terms.\n\n==Qualifications==\nGovernors of Michigan, as well as their [[Lieutenant Governor of Michigan|lieutenant governors]], must be United States citizens who have resided in Michigan for the four years preceding election and must be at least 30 years of age.<ref>[https://legislature.mi.gov/(S(tnunzhrfmcwrlzqlki4tzpua))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Article-V-22 Michigan Constitution: Article V, Sec. 22\u2014Governor and lieutenant governor, qualifications]</ref> A constitutional amendment adopted by the voters at the 2010 general election provides that a person is ineligible for any elected office, including governor and lieutenant governor, if convicted of a felony involving dishonesty, deceit, fraud, or a breach of the public trust, and if the conviction were related to the person's official capacity while holding any elective office or position of employment in local, State, or Federal government.<ref>[https://legislature.mi.gov/(S(tnunzhrfmcwrlzqlki4tzpua))/mileg.aspx?page=getObject&objectName=mcl-Article-XI-8 Michigan Constitution: Article XI, Sec. 8 Convictions for certain felonies; eligibility for elective office or certain positions of public employment]</ref>\n\n==Elections and term of office==\nFrom statehood until the election of 1966, governors were elected to two-year terms. Elections are held in November and the governor assumes office the following January, except in the case of death or resignation. From statehood until 1851, elections were held in odd-numbered years. A new state constitution was drafted in 1850 and took effect in 1851. As part of the process bringing the constitution into effect, there was a single one-year term of governor in 1851. Thereafter elections were held in even years.\n\nThe [[Michigan Constitution|constitution adopted in 1963]] changed the governor's term to four years, starting in 1967. Since then, gubernatorial elections have been offset by two years between the [[United States presidential election|U.S. presidential elections]] (e.g., Presidential elections were in [[United States presidential election in Michigan, 2008|2008]] and [[United States presidential election in Michigan, 2012|2012]], while gubernatorial elections in that time period were in [[Michigan gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]] and [[Michigan gubernatorial election, 2014|2014]]). Gubernatorial elections are held concurrently with [[Michigan Senate|State Senate]] elections. The winner of the gubernatorial election takes office at noon on January 1 of the year following the election.\n\nIn 1992, an amendment to the Michigan constitution imposed a lifetime term limit of two four-year terms for the office of governor. Prior to this, they were not limited as to how many terms they could serve; [[John Engler]], the governor at the time, served three terms as his first term occurred prior to the restriction. Engler was reelected in 1994 and 1998 before being term limited in 2002.\n\n==Powers and duties==\nThe governor has responsibilities to:\n* sign or veto laws passed by the legislature;<ref name=mib>{{cite book |title = Michigan in Brief: 1998\u201399 |chapter= Chapter 2: About State Government |year = 1999 |publisher = Public Sector Consultants |chapter-url = http://www.michiganinbrief.org/edition06/acrobat/chap-2.pdf }}</ref> including a [[line item veto]]\n* reorganize state executive government agencies and departments;<ref name=mib/>\n* appoint, with advice and consent of the Senate, and oversee most department heads;<ref name=mib/>\n* appoint judges, subject to ratification by the electorate;\n* appoint members of boards and commissions;<ref name=mib/>\n* propose a state budget;<ref name=mib/>\n* give the annual ''[[State of the State address]]'';<ref name=mib/>\n* sue other executives to comply with the law;\n* command the state [[Michigan Department of Military and Veterans Affairs|militia]]; and\n* grant pardons for any crime, except cases involving [[impeachment]] by the legislature.\n\nThe governor appoints the members of the governing boards of 10 of the state's 13 public universities<ref group=lower-alpha>The [[Board of Regents of the University of Michigan]], the Board of Trustees of [[Michigan State University]] and the Board of Governors of [[Wayne State University]] are elected statewide.

Mason]], the first governor of the State of Michigan]]\nForty-eight people have been governor of the state. Prior to statehood, there were five governors of the [[Michigan Territory]]. [[Stevens T. Mason]], Michigan's first governor, also served as a territorial governor. He was elected governor at age 23 as a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in 1835 and served until 1840. Mason was the youngest state governor in United States history.\n\n[[Jennifer Granholm]] became the first [[List of female state governors in the United States|female]] Governor of Michigan on January 1, 2003, when she succeeded [[John Engler]]; she served for 8 years, until January 1, 2011.

They sing of the past and the present, and of the future when [[Odin|Wotan]] will set fire to [[Valhalla]] to signal the end of the [[\u00c6sir|gods]]. Without warning, their rope breaks. Lamenting the loss of their wisdom, the Norns disappear.\n\nAs day breaks, [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] and Br\u00fcnnhilde emerge from their cave, high on a mountaintop surrounded by magic fire. Br\u00fcnnhilde sends Siegfried off to new adventures, urging him to keep their love in mind. As a pledge of fidelity, Siegfried gives her the [[Andvarinaut|ring of power]] that he took from [[Fafnir|Fafner]]'s hoard. Bearing Br\u00fcnnhilde's shield and mounting her horse [[Grani|Grane]], Siegfried rides away as an orchestral interlude (Siegfried's Journey to the Rhine) starts.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\n[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 130.jpg|thumb|228x228px|Br\u00fcnnhilde is visited by her Valkyrie sister Waltraute (Arthur Rackham, 1912)]]\nThe act begins in the Hall of the [[Gibichung]]s, a population dwelling by the [[Rhine]]. [[Gunther]], lord of the Gibichungs, sits enthroned. His half-brother and chief minister, [[Hagen (legend)|Hagen]], advises him to find a wife for himself and a husband for their sister [[Gudrun|Gutrune]]. He suggests Br\u00fcnnhilde for Gunther's wife, and Siegfried for Gutrune's husband. He reminds Gutrune that he has given her a potion that she can use to make Siegfried forget Br\u00fcnnhilde and fall in love with Gutrune; under its influence, Siegfried will win Br\u00fcnnhilde for Gunther. Gunther and Gutrune agree enthusiastically with this plan.\n\nSiegfried appears at Gibichung Hall, seeking to meet Gunther. Gunther extends his hospitality to the hero, and Gutrune offers him the love potion. Unaware of the deception, Siegfried toasts Br\u00fcnnhilde and their love. Drinking the potion, he loses his memory of Br\u00fcnnhilde and falls in love with Gutrune instead. In his drugged state, Siegfried offers to win a wife for Gunther, who tells him about Br\u00fcnnhilde and the magic fire which only a fearless person can cross. They swear [[Blood brother|blood-brotherhood]] (Hagen holds the drinking horn in which they mix their blood, but he does not join in the oath) and leave for Br\u00fcnnhilde's rock. Hagen, left on guard duty, gloats that his so-called masters are unwittingly bringing the ring to him (Monologue: Hagen's watch).\n\nMeanwhile, Br\u00fcnnhilde is visited by her [[Valkyrie]] sister Waltraute, who tells her that [[Odin|Wotan]] returned from his wanderings with [[Gungnir|his spear]] shattered. Wotan is dismayed at losing his spear, as it has all the treaties and bargains he has made&mdash;everything that gives him power&mdash;carved into its shaft. Wotan ordered branches of [[Yggdrasil|the World tree]], to be piled around Valhalla; sent [[Huginn and Muninn|his magic ravens]] to spy on the world and bring him news; and currently waits in Valhalla for the end. Waltraute begs Br\u00fcnnhilde to return the ring to the [[Rhinemaidens]], since the ring's curse is now affecting their father, Wotan. However, Br\u00fcnnhilde refuses to relinquish Siegfried's token of love, and Waltraute rides away in despair.\n\nSiegfried arrives, disguised as Gunther by using the [[Tarnhelm]], and claims Br\u00fcnnhilde as his wife. Though Br\u00fcnnhilde resists violently, Siegfried overpowers her, snatching the ring from her hand and placing it on his own.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\n[[File:Josef Hoffmann - G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung Act II final.jpg|thumb|Stage design by Josef Hoffmann for original production in 1876 \u2013 Act II, last scene.]]\nHagen, waiting by the bank of the Rhine, is visited in his semi-waking sleep (sitting up, eyes open, but motionless) by his father, [[Alberich]]. On Alberich's urging, he swears to kill Siegfried and acquire the ring. Alberich exits as dawn breaks. Siegfried arrives via Tarnhelm-magic, having resumed his natural form and left Br\u00fcnnhilde on the boat with Gunther. Hagen summons the Gibichung vassals to welcome Gunther and his bride.  He does this by sounding the war-alarm. The vassals are surprised to learn that the occasion is not battle, but their master's wedding and party.\n\nGunther leads in a downcast Br\u00fcnnhilde, who is astonished to see Siegfried. Noticing the ring on Siegfried's hand, she realizes she has been betrayed\u2014that the man who conquered her was not Gunther, but Siegfried in disguise. She denounces Siegfried in front of Gunther's vassals and accuses Siegfried of having seduced her himself. Siegfried, who does not remember ever having been Br\u00fcnhilde's lover, swears on Hagen's spear that her accusations are false. Br\u00fcnnhilde seizes the tip of the spear and swears that they are true. Once again Hagen supervises silently as others take oaths to his advantage. But this time, since the oath is sworn on a weapon, the understanding is that if the oath is proven false, the weapon's owner should avenge it by killing the perjurer with that weapon. Siegfried then leads Gutrune and the bystanders off to the wedding feast, leaving Br\u00fcnnhilde, Hagen, and Gunther alone by the shore. Deeply shamed by Br\u00fcnnhilde's outburst, Gunther agrees to Hagen's suggestion that Siegfried must be killed in order for Gunther to regain his standing. Br\u00fcnnhilde, seeking revenge for Siegfried's manifest treachery, joins the plot and tells Hagen that Siegfried would be vulnerable to a stab in the back. Hagen and Gunther decide to lure Siegfried on a hunting-trip and murder him. They sing a trio in which Br\u00fcnnhilde and Gunther vow in the name of Wotan, \"guardian of oaths\", to kill Siegfried, while Hagen repeats his pledge to Alberich: to acquire the ring and rule the world through its power.\n\n=== Act 3 ===\n[[File:Siegfried and the Twilight of the Gods p 162.jpg|thumb|282x282px|\"The Rhinemaidens warn Siegfried\" (Arthur Rackham, 1912)]]\nIn the woods by the bank of the Rhine, the Rhinemaidens mourn the lost Rhine gold. Siegfried happens by, separated from the hunting party. The Rhinemaidens urge him to return the ring and avoid its curse, but he laughs at them and says he prefers to die rather than bargain for his life. They swim away, predicting that Siegfried will die and that his heir, a lady, will treat them more fairly.\n\nSiegfried rejoins the hunters, who include Gunther and Hagen. While resting, he tells them about the adventures of his youth. Hagen gives him another potion, which restores his memory, and he tells of discovering the sleeping Br\u00fcnnhilde and awakening her with a kiss. Hagen [[Stab-in-the-back myth|stabs him in the back]] with his spear. The others look on in horror, and Hagen explains in three words (\"''Meineid r\u00e4cht' ich!''\" \u2013 \"I have avenged perjury!\") that since Siegfried admitted loving Br\u00fcnnhilde, the oath he swore on Hagen's spear was obviously false, therefore it was Hagen's duty to kill him with it. Hagen calmly walks away into the wood. Siegfried recollects his awakening of Br\u00fcnnhilde and dies. His body is carried away in a solemn funeral procession (Siegfried's funeral march) that forms the interlude as the scene is changed and recapitulates many of the themes associated with Siegfried and the W\u00e4lsungs.\n\nBack in the Gibichung Hall, Gutrune awaits Siegfried's return. Hagen arrives ahead of the funeral party. Gutrune is devastated when Siegfried's corpse is brought in. Gunther blames Siegfried's death on Hagen, who replies that Siegfried had incurred the penalty of his false oath, and further, claims the ring on Siegfried's finger by right of conquest. When Gunther objects, Hagen appeals to the vassals to support his claim. Gunther draws his sword but Hagen attacks and easily kills him. However, as Hagen moves to take the ring, Siegfried's hand rises threateningly. Hagen recoils in fear.\n\nBr\u00fcnnhilde makes her entrance and issues orders for a huge funeral pyre to be assembled by the river (the start of the Immolation Scene).  She takes the ring and tells the Rhinemaidens to claim it from her ashes, once fire has cleansed it of its curse. Lighting the pyre with a firebrand, she sends Wotan's ravens home with \"anxiously longed-for tidings\", and to fly by the magic fire for Loge to fulfill his task.  After an [[Apostrophe (figure of speech)|apostrophe]] to the dead hero, Br\u00fcnnhilde mounts her horse Grane and rides into the flames.\n\nA sequence of leitmotifs portray the fire flaring up, and the hall of the Gibichungs catching fire and collapsing. The Rhine overflows its banks, quenching the fire, and the Rhinemaidens swim in to claim the ring. Hagen tries to stop them but they drag him into the depths and drown him. As they celebrate the return of the ring and its gold to the river, a red glow is seen in the sky. As the Gibichungs watch, the interior of Valhalla is finally seen, with gods and heroes visible as described by Waltraute in Act 1. Flames flare up in the Hall of the Gods, hiding it and them from sight completely. As the gods are consumed in the flames, the curtain falls to the sound of the ''Erl\u00f6sungsmotif''\u2014the redemption [[leitmotif]].\n\n== Noted excerpts ==\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Siegfrieds funeral march and finale.ogg|title=Siegfried's Funeral March and Finale|description=Performed December 8\u201311, 1981 by the [[United States Marine Corps Band]] (10:30)}}\nTwo extended orchestral selections\u2014\"Dawn and Siegfried's Rhine Journey\", an abridged excerpt from the Prologue without the singers; and \"Siegfried's Funeral March\", lifted uncut from act 3\u2014are often presented outside the opera house, and are published separately from the lengthy work.

His father was a military bandmaster, and by the time Arthur had reached the age of eight, he was proficient with all the instruments in the band. In school he began to compose [[anthem]]s and songs. In 1856, he received the first [[Mendelssohn Scholarship]] and studied at the [[Royal Academy of Music]] and then at [[Leipzig]], where he also took up conducting. His graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of [[The Tempest (Sullivan)|incidental music]] to [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[The Tempest]]''. Revised and expanded, it was performed at [[the Crystal Palace]] in 1862 and was an immediate sensation. He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer, composing a symphony, a concerto, and several overtures, among them the ''[[Overture di Ballo]]'', in 1870.<ref name=Lawrence1>[http://gsarchive.net/sullivan/interviews/lawrence.html \"An Illustrated Interview with Sir Arthur Sullivan, by Arthur H Lawrence, Part 1\"], ''The Strand Magazine'', Volume xiv, No.84 (December 1897).

He composed a ballet, ''[[L'\u00cele Enchant\u00e9e]]'' (1864) and incidental music for a number of Shakespeare plays. Other early pieces that were praised were his ''[[Symphony in E, Irish|Symphony in E]]'', ''[[Cello Concerto (Sullivan)|Concerto for Cello and Orchestra]]'', and ''[[Overture in C (In Memoriam)]]'' (all three of which premiered in 1866).<ref>Shepherd, Marc, [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/sullorch.htm ''Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan: Orchestral and Band Music''], ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Discography'', accessed 10 June 2007</ref> These commissions, however, were not sufficient to keep Sullivan afloat.

C. Burnand]] for an informal gathering of friends. Public performance followed, with W. S. Gilbert (then writing dramatic criticism for the magazine ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'') saying that Sullivan's score \"is, in many places, of too high a class for the grotesquely absurd plot to which it is wedded.\"<ref>Harris, Roger, ed. (1999). Cox and Box. Chorleywood, Herts., UK: R. Clyde. pp. X\u2013XI</ref> Nonetheless, it proved highly successful, and is still regularly performed today.

The piece was an [[extravaganza]] in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, one of whom is the eponymous [[Thespis]], the Greek father of the drama. Its mixture of political satire and [[grand opera]] parody mimicked [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach's]] ''[[Orpheus in the Underworld]]'' and ''[[La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne]]'', which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.<ref name=Tillett>Tillett, Selwyn and Spencer, Roderic. \"Forty Years of Thespis Scholarship\", text of talk delivered at the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Festival weekend, [[Cirencester]], 21 September 2002.</ref><ref>Jean-Bernard Piat: ''Guide du m\u00e9lomane averti'', Le Livre de Poche 8026, Paris 1992</ref>\n\n''Thespis'' opened on [[Boxing Day]] and ran for 63 performances.

Gilbert Society Journal'', Vol. 4, part 3, Issue 29. Summer 2011.</ref> but no one at the time anticipated that this was the beginning of a great collaboration. Unlike the later Gilbert and Sullivan works, it was hastily prepared, and its nature was more risqu\u00e9, like Gilbert's earlier [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]], with a broader style of comedy that allowed for improvisation by the actors. Two of the male characters were played by women, whose shapely legs were put on display in a fashion that Gilbert later condemned.<ref>Williams, chapter 1</ref> The musical score to ''Thespis'' was never published and is now lost, except for one song that was published separately, a chorus that was re-used in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and the Act II ballet music.<ref name=Tillett/>\n\nOver the next three years, Gilbert and Sullivan did not have occasion to work together again, but each man became more eminent in his field. Gilbert worked with Frederic Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872) and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), and wrote ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873) ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874) and several other libretti, farces, extravaganzas, fairy comedies, dramas and adaptations. Sullivan completed his ''[[Festival Te Deum]]'' (1872); another oratorio, ''The Light of the World'' (1873); his only [[song cycle]], ''[[The Window; or, The Song of the Wrens]]'' (1871); [[incidental music]] to ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' (1874); and more songs, parlour ballads, and [[hymn]]s, including \"[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]\" (1872). At the same time, the audience for theatre was growing because of the rapidly expanding British population; improvement in education and the standard of living, especially of the middle class; improving public transportation; and installation of street lighting, which made travel home from the theatre safer. The number of pianos manufactured in England doubled between 1870 and 1890 as more people began to play [[parlour music]] at home and more theatres and concert halls opened.<ref>Jacobs, pp. 2\u20133</ref><ref>Gillan, Don.

Not long afterwards, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]] and needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La P\u00e9richole]]''. Carte knew about Gilbert's libretto for Rosa and suggested that Sullivan write a score for it. Gilbert read the piece to Sullivan in February 1875, and the composer was delighted with it; ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed and staged in a matter of weeks.<ref>Barker, John W. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070515174236/http://www.madisonsavoyards.org/Public/reference/gsbio.html \"Gilbert and Sullivan\"], Madison Savoyards, Ltd., accessed 21 May 2007, quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: \"As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time.\"</ref>\n\n[[Image:Trial by Jury - Chaos in the Courtroom.png|thumb|left|[[D. H. Friston]]'s engraving of the original production of ''[[Trial by Jury]]'']]\nThe piece is one of Gilbert's humorous spoofs of the law and the legal profession, based on his short experience as a [[barrister]]. It concerns a [[breach of promise]] of marriage suit. The defendant argues that damages should be slight, since \"he is such a very bad lot,\" while the plaintiff argues that she loves the defendant fervently and seeks \"substantial damages.\" After much argument, the judge resolves the case by marrying the lovely plaintiff himself. With Sullivan's brother, [[Fred Sullivan|Fred]], as the Learned Judge, the opera was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La P\u00e9richole''. Provincial tours and productions at other theatres quickly followed.<ref>Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://gsarchive.net/books/walbrook/chap3.html ''Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment'' (Chapter 3)], ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 21 May 2007</ref>\n\nFred Sullivan was the prototype for the \"[[patter song|patter]]\" (comic) [[baritone]] roles in the later operas. [[F. C. Burnand]] wrote that he \"was one of the most naturally ''comic little men'' I ever came across. He, too, was a first-rate practical musician.... As he was the most absurd person, so was he the very kindliest....\"<ref>Ayer p. 408</ref> Fred's creation would serve as a model for the rest of the collaborators' works, and each of them has a crucial ''comic little man'' role, as Burnand had put it. The \"patter\" baritone (or \"principal comedian\", as these roles later were called) would often assume the leading role in Gilbert and Sullivan's comic operas, and was usually allotted the speedy [[patter song]]s.\n\nAfter the success of ''Trial by Jury'', Gilbert and Sullivan were suddenly in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of ''Thespis'' for the 1875 Christmas season, which Gilbert and Sullivan would have revised, but he was unable to obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that Gilbert and Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.<ref>Wachs, Kevin.

Wachs concludes that much of the material from a draft of this opera later made its way into Act II of ''The Pirates of Penzance''.</ref>\n\n===Early successes===\n\n====''The Sorcerer''====\n{{main|The Sorcerer}}\nCarte's real ambition was to develop an English form of light opera that would displace the bawdy [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and badly translated French [[operetta]]s then dominating the London stage. He assembled a syndicate and formed the Comedy Opera Company, with Gilbert and Sullivan commissioned to write a comic opera that would serve as the centrepiece for an evening's entertainment.\n\n[[Image:Sorc-Pin-Trial.jpg|thumb|An early poster showing scenes from ''The Sorcerer'', ''Pinafore'', and ''Trial by Jury'']]\nGilbert found a subject in one of his own short stories, \"The Elixir of Love,\" which concerned the complications arising when a love potion is distributed to all the residents of a small village. The leading character was a [[Cockney]] businessman who happened to be a sorcerer, a purveyor of blessings (not much called for) and curses (very popular). Gilbert and Sullivan were tireless taskmasters, seeing to it that ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' (1877) opened as a fully polished production, in marked contrast to the under-rehearsed ''Thespis''.<ref>[http://gsarchive.net/sorcerer/html/index.html ''The Sorcerer''], ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 21 May 2007</ref> While ''The Sorcerer'' won critical acclaim, it did not duplicate the success of ''Trial by Jury''. Nevertheless, Carte and his syndicate were sufficiently encouraged to commission another full-length opera from the team.\n\n====''H.M.S. Pinafore''====\n{{main|H.M.S. Pinafore}}\nGilbert and Sullivan scored their first international hit with ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' (1878), satirising the rise of unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in ''The Sorcerer'', love between members of different social classes). As with many of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically near the end of the story.\n\nGilbert oversaw the designs of sets and costumes, and he directed the performers on stage.<ref>Gilbert was strongly influenced by the innovations in 'stagecraft', now called stage direction, by the playwrights [[James Planche]] and especially [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]].

Gilbert's word was law; he thoroughly worked out in his own mind every bit of action, by-play and grouping, and allowed no deviation from his plan. He...made drawings and took measurements with the minutest care.... He had unlimited fertility of invention in comic business and would allow no gag, no clowning, no departure from his own definite conception. Sullivan's musical conception was equally clear-cut and decided. Every part must be made subservient to the whole, and his sarcasms overwhelmed the transgressor with scorn. \"And now, might I trouble you to try over my music,\" he would say to a singer too anxious to display his or her top notes. But there was nothing to hurt or offend us in this unswerving discipline, we took their good-humoured raillery as our due when we failed in our rendering or overstepped the bounds; and the patience and enthusiasm of that artistic pair so infected all of us that we worked willingly for hours and hours at rehearsals, trying with all our might to realize the conceptions of those two brilliant minds.<ref>Bond, Jessie.

Pinafore'' relied on [[stock character]] types, many of which were familiar from European opera (and some of which grew out of Gilbert's earlier association with the [[German Reed Entertainment|German Reeds]]): the heroic protagonist ([[tenor]]) and his love-interest ([[soprano]]); the older woman with a secret or a sharp tongue ([[contralto]]); the baffled lyric [[baritone]]\u2014the girl's father; and a classic villain ([[bass-baritone]]). Gilbert and Sullivan added the element of the comic [[patter song|patter-singing character]]. With the success of ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', the D'Oyly Carte repertory and production system was cemented, and each opera would make use of these stock character types. Before ''The Sorcerer'', Gilbert had constructed his plays around the established stars of whatever theatre he happened to be writing for, as had been the case with ''Thespis'' and ''Trial by Jury''. Building on the team he had assembled for ''The Sorcerer'', Gilbert no longer hired stars; he created them. He and Sullivan selected the performers, writing their operas for ensemble casts rather than individual stars.\n\n[[Image:Pirate King1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Pirate King]]\nThe repertory system ensured that the comic patter character who performed the role of the sorcerer, John Wellington Wells, would become the ruler of the Queen's navy as Sir Joseph Porter in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', then join the army as Major-General Stanley in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', and so on. Similarly, Mrs. Partlet in ''The Sorcerer'' transformed into Little Buttercup in ''Pinafore'', then into Ruth, the piratical maid-of-all-work in ''Pirates''. Relatively unknown performers whom Gilbert and Sullivan engaged early in the collaboration would stay with the company for many years, becoming stars of the Victorian stage. These included [[George Grossmith]], the principal comic; [[Rutland Barrington]], the lyric baritone; [[Richard Temple (opera singer)|Richard Temple]], the bass-baritone; and [[Jessie Bond]], the [[mezzo-soprano]] [[soubrette]].\n\n====''The Pirates of Penzance''====\n{{main|The Pirates of Penzance}}\n''The Pirates of Penzance'' (New Year's Eve, 1879) also poked fun at [[grand opera]] conventions, sense of duty, family obligation, the \"respectability\" of civilisation and the peerage, and the relevance of a liberal education. The story also revisits ''Pinafore''{{'}}s theme of unqualified people in positions of authority, in the person of the [[Major General's Song|\"modern Major-General\"]] who has up-to-date knowledge about everything except the military. The Major-General and his many daughters escape from the tender-hearted Pirates of Penzance, who are all orphans, on the false plea that he is an orphan himself.

Grossmith, who created the role of Bunthorne, based his makeup, wig and costume on Swinburne and especially Whistler, as seen in the adjacent photo.<ref>Ellmann, Richard ''Oscar Wilde'', (Knopf, 1988) pp. 135 and 151\u2013152 {{ISBN|0-394-55484-1}}</ref> The work also lampoons male vanity and chauvinism in the military. The story concerns two rival \"aesthetic\" poets, who attract the attention of the young ladies of the village, who had been engaged to the members of a cavalry regiment. But both poets are in love with Patience, the village milkmaid, who detests one of them and feels that it is her duty to avoid the other despite her love for him.

The fully electric Savoy made possible numerous special effects, such as sparkling magic wands for the female chorus of fairies. The opera poked fun at English law and the [[House of Lords]] and made much of the war between the sexes. The critics felt that Sullivan's work in ''Iolanthe'' had taken a step forward. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, \"The composer has risen to his opportunity, and we are disposed to account ''Iolanthe'' his best effort in all the Gilbertian series.\"<ref>Quoted in Allen 1975b, p. 176</ref> Similarly, the ''Theatre'' asserted that \"the music of ''Iolanthe'' is Dr Sullivan's ''chef d'oeuvre''.

Gilbert had referred to the new technology in ''Pinafore'' in 1878, only two years after the device was invented and before London even had telephone service. Sullivan had one installed as well, and on 13 May 1883, at a party to celebrate the composer's 41st birthday, the guests, including the [[Prince of Wales]] (later [[Edward VII]]), heard a direct relay of parts of ''Iolanthe'' from the Savoy. This was probably the first live \"broadcast\" of an opera.<ref>Bradley (1996), p. 176</ref>\n\nDuring the run of ''Iolanthe'', in 1883, Sullivan was [[British honours system|knighted]] by [[Queen Victoria]]. Although it was the operas with Gilbert that had earned him the broadest fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should put an end to his career as a composer of comic opera\u2014that a musical [[knighthood|knight]] should not stoop below oratorio or [[grand opera]].<ref>Baily, p. 250</ref> Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after ''Iolanthe'' opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.<ref name=Carpet/>\n\n====''Princess Ida''====\n[[File:William Russell Flint - W. S. Gilbert - Savoy Operas - Princess Ida 6.jpg|thumb|300px|''Princess Ida'', Act II Finale: Hildebrand and soldiers rush through the gate.]]\n{{main|Princess Ida}}\n''Princess Ida'' (1884) spoofed [[women's education]] and [[male chauvinism]] and continued the theme from ''Iolanthe'' of the war between the sexes. The opera is based on [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poem ''The Princess: A Medley''. Gilbert had written a [[blank verse]] farce based on the same material in 1870, called ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]'', and he reused a good deal of the dialogue from his earlier play in the libretto of ''Princess Ida''. ''Ida'' is the only Gilbert and Sullivan work with dialogue entirely in blank verse and is also the only one of their works in three acts. [[Lillian Russell]] had been engaged to create the title role, but Gilbert did not believe that she was dedicated enough, and when she missed a rehearsal, he dismissed her.<ref>Stedman, pp. 200\u201301</ref>\n\n''Princess Ida'' was the first of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas that, by the partnership's previous standards, was not a success. A particularly hot summer in London did not help ticket sales. The piece ran for a comparatively short 246 performances and was not revived in London until 1919. Sullivan had been satisfied with the libretto, but two months after ''Ida'' opened, Sullivan told Carte that \"it is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\"<ref name=Carpet/> As ''Princess Ida'' showed signs of flagging, Carte realised that, for the first time in the partnership's history, no new opera would be ready when the old one closed. On 22 March 1884, he gave Gilbert and Sullivan contractual notice that a new opera would be required in six months' time.<ref>Jacobs, p. 187</ref> In the meantime, when ''Ida'' closed, Carte produced a revival of ''The Sorcerer''.\n\n===Dodging the magic lozenge===\n\n====''The Mikado''====\n{{main|The Mikado}}\n[[Image:The Mikado Three Little Maids.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lithograph of the \"Three Little Maids\" from ''The Mikado'']]\nThe most successful of the Savoy Operas was ''The Mikado'' (1885), which made fun of English bureaucracy, thinly disguised by a Japanese setting. Gilbert initially proposed a story for a new opera about a magic [[lozenge]] that would change the characters,<ref>Gilbert eventually found another opportunity to present his \"lozenge plot\" in ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'', written with [[Alfred Cellier]] in 1892</ref> which Sullivan found artificial and lacking in \"human interest and probability\", as well as being too similar to their earlier opera, ''The Sorcerer''. As dramatised in the film ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]'',<ref>albeit with the repetition of the apocryphal sword-falling story, see Jones, Brian (Spring 1985), \"The sword that never fell\", ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'' 1 (1): 22\u201325</ref> the author and composer were at an impasse until 8 May 1884, when Gilbert dropped the lozenge idea and agreed to provide a libretto without any supernatural elements.\n\nThe story focuses on a \"cheap tailor,\" Ko-Ko, who is promoted to the position of Lord High Executioner of the town of Titipu. Ko-Ko loves his ward, Yum-Yum, but she loves a musician, who is really the son of the emperor of Japan (the Mikado), and who is in disguise to escape the attentions of the elderly and amorous Katisha. The Mikado has decreed that executions must resume without delay in Titipu. When news arrives that the Mikado will be visiting the town, Ko-Ko assumes that he is coming to ascertain whether Ko-Ko has carried out the executions. Too timid to execute anyone, Ko-Ko cooks up a conspiracy to misdirect the Mikado, which goes awry. Eventually, Ko-Ko must persuade Katisha to marry him, in order to save his own life and the lives of the other conspirators.\n\nWith the opening of trade between England and Japan, Japanese imports, art and styles [[Japanese Village, Knightsbridge|became fashionable in London]], making the time ripe for an opera set in Japan. Gilbert said, \"I cannot give you a good reason for our... piece being laid in Japan. It... afforded scope for picturesque treatment, scenery and costume, and I think that the idea of a chief magistrate, who is... judge and actual executioner in one, and yet would not hurt a worm, may perhaps please the public.\"<ref>[http://gsarchive.net/gilbert/interviews/dlynws850121.html \"Workers and Their Work: Mr. W.S. Gilbert\"], ''Daily News'', 21 January 1885, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 21 August 2012</ref>\n\nSetting the opera in Japan, an exotic locale far away from Britain, allowed Gilbert and Sullivan to satirise British politics and institutions more freely by clothing them in superficial Japanese trappings. Gilbert wrote, \"The Mikado of the opera was an imaginary monarch of a remote period and cannot by any exercise of ingenuity be taken to be a slap on an existing institution.\"<ref>[http://pamphletpress.org/index.cfm?sec=7&story_id=69 Review of ''The Mikado''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045525/http://pamphletpress.org/index.cfm?sec=7&story_id=69 |date=27 September 2007 }}, Pamphletpress.org, accessed 27 May 2009</ref> [[G.

The dialogue, though in prose, is quasi-[[Early Modern English|early modern English]] in style, and there is no satire of British institutions. For some of the plot elements, Gilbert had reached back to his 1875 tragedy, ''[[Broken Hearts]]''.

The critics, who had recently lauded the composer for his successful oratorio, ''[[The Golden Legend (cantata)|The Golden Legend]]'', considered the score to ''Yeomen'' to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, which was written in [[sonata form]], rather than as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as in most of his other overtures. The ''Daily Telegraph'' wrote:\n\n{{quote|The accompaniments... are delightful to hear, and especially does the treatment of the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert himself could hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in ''The Yeomen of the Guard'' before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera....<ref>Quoted in Allen 1975, p. 312</ref>}}\n\n''Yeomen'' was a hit, running for over a year, with strong New York and touring productions. During the run, on 12 March 1889, Sullivan wrote to Gilbert,\n\n{{quote|I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it... You say that in a serious opera, ''you'' must more or less sacrifice yourself. I say that this is just what I have been doing in all our joint pieces, and, what is more, must continue to do in comic opera to make it successful.<ref>Jacobs, p. 283</ref>}}\n\nSullivan insisted that the next opera must be a [[grand opera]]. Gilbert did not feel that he could write a grand opera libretto, but he offered a compromise that Sullivan eventually accepted. The two would write a light opera for the Savoy, and at the same time, Sullivan a grand opera (''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]'') for a new theatre that Carte was constructing to present British grand opera. After a brief impasse over the choice of subject, Sullivan accepted an idea connected with [[Venice]] and Venetian life, as \"this seemed to me to hold out great chances of bright colour and taking music.\"<ref>Jacobs, p. 288</ref>\n\n====''The Gondoliers''====\n{{main|The Gondoliers}}\n[[Image:Marco and Giuseppe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rutland Barrington]] and [[Courtice Pounds]] as Giuseppe and Marco in ''The Gondoliers'']]\n''The Gondoliers'' (1889) takes place partly in Venice and partly in a kingdom ruled by a pair of gondoliers who attempt to remodel the monarchy in a spirit of \"republican equality.\"<ref>[http://gsarchive.net/gondoliers/html/index.html ''The Gondoliers'' at The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive], accessed 21 July 2007</ref> Gilbert recapitulates a number of his earlier themes, including the satire of class distinctions figuring in many of his earlier librettos. The libretto also reflects Gilbert's fascination with the \"Stock Company Act\", highlighting the absurd convergence of natural persons and legal entities, which plays an even larger part in the next opera, ''Utopia Limited''. Press accounts were almost entirely favourable. The ''Illustrated London News'' reported:\n\n{{quote|...Gilbert has returned to the Gilbert of the past, and everyone is delighted. He is himself again. The Gilbert of the ''[[Bab Ballads]]'', the Gilbert of whimsical conceit, inoffensive cynicism, subtle satire, and playful paradox; the Gilbert who invented a school of his own, who in it was schoolmaster and pupil, who has never taught anybody but himself, and is never likely to have any imitator\u2014this is the Gilbert the public want to see, and this is the Gilbert who on Saturday night was cheered till the audience was weary of cheering any more.<ref name=\"fvpqpk\"/>}}\n\nSullivan's old collaborator on ''[[Cox and Box]]'' (later the editor of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine), [[Francis Burnand|F.

Burnand]], wrote to the composer: \"Magnificento!...I envy you and W.S.G. being able to place a piece like this on the stage in so complete a fashion.\"<ref name=\"fvpqpk\">Baily, p. 344</ref> The opera enjoyed a run longer than any of their other joint works except for ''H.M.S. Pinafore'', ''Patience'' and ''The Mikado''. There was a command performance of ''The Gondoliers'' for [[Queen Victoria]] and the royal family at [[Windsor Castle]] in 1891, the first Gilbert and Sullivan opera to be so honoured. ''The Gondoliers'' was Gilbert and Sullivan's last great success.\n\n===Carpet quarrel===\nGilbert and Sullivan sometimes had a strained working relationship, partly caused by the fact that each man saw himself as allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly caused by the opposing personalities of the two\u2014Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned (though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness), while Sullivan eschewed conflict.<ref>See, e.g., Stedman, pp. 254\u201356 and 323\u201324 and Ainger, pp. 193\u201394.</ref> In addition, Gilbert imbued his libretti with \"topsy-turvy\" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.<ref>See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3</ref> Also, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at the wealthy and powerful whom Sullivan sought out for friendship and patronage.<ref>See, e.g. Jacobs, p. 73; Crowther, Andrew, [http://gsarchive.net/gilbert/life/long_bio.html ''The Life of W.S.

After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' to ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.<ref name=Carpet/>\n\nIn April 1890, however, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership.<ref name=Ford>Ford, Tom.

''Limelight Magazine'', Haymarket Media Ltd., 8 June 2011</ref> Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that \"I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen\".<ref name=Carpet/> Helen Carte wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte \"in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial.\"<ref>Stedman, p. 270</ref> As scholar Andrew Crowther has explained:\n\n{{quote|After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the \"Quarrel\", that Carte had admitted \"an unintentional overcharge of nearly \u00a31,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone.<ref name=Carpet/>}}\n\n[[File:PeaceOfferingG&S.jpg|thumb|left|In the midst of the quarrel, Gilbert dedicated a collection of Savoy opera lyrics, ''Songs of a Savoyard'', to the composer]]\nThings soon degraded, a legal hearing was held, and Sullivan supported Carte by making an affidavit erroneously stating that there were minor legal expenses outstanding from a battle Gilbert had in 1884 with [[Lillian Russell]].<ref>Ainger, pp. 312\u2013316</ref> On 5 May 1890, Gilbert had written to Sullivan: \"The time for putting an end to our collaboration has at last arrived.\"<ref name=Carpet/> Gilbert later asked Sullivan to say he had been mistaken in his affidavit, but Sullivan refused. Gilbert felt it was a moral issue, and could not look past it. Sullivan felt that Gilbert was questioning his good faith, and in any event, Sullivan had other reasons to stay in Carte's good graces: Carte was building a new theatre, the [[Royal English Opera House]], to produce Sullivan's only [[grand opera]], ''[[Ivanhoe (opera)|Ivanhoe]]''.<ref name=Carpet/> Gilbert brought suit, and after ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.<ref name=vowed>Shepherd, Marc.

Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the [[Royal English Opera House]], Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.<ref name=vowed/> In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, Gilbert and Sullivan's music publisher, [[Chappell & Co.|Tom Chappell]], stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between Gilbert and Sullivan.<ref>Wolfson, p. 7</ref>\n\n===Last works===\n[[Image:Utopia Limited Poster.jpg|thumb|400px|The drawing room scene from Act II of ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'']]\n''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893), their penultimate opera, was a very modest success, and their last, ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896), was an outright failure.<ref>Wolfson, passim</ref> Neither work entered the canon of regularly performed Gilbert and Sullivan works until the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company made the first complete professional recordings of the two operas in the 1970s. Gilbert had also offered Sullivan another libretto, ''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'' (1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting [[Nancy McIntosh]], his protege from ''Utopia'', led to Sullivan's refusal, and ''His Excellency'' was instead composed by [[F. Osmond Carr]].<ref>Wolfson, pp. 61\u201365</ref> Meanwhile, the Savoy Theatre continued to revive the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, in between new pieces, and D'Oyly Carte touring companies also played them in repertory.\n\n[[Image:Glad to See You Together.png|thumb|left|upright|The ''Entr'acte'' expresses its pleasure that Gilbert and Sullivan are reunited]]\nAfter ''The Grand Duke'', the partners saw no reason to work together again. A last unpleasant misunderstanding occurred in 1898. At the premiere of Sullivan\u2019s opera ''[[The Beauty Stone]]'' on 28 May, Gilbert arrived at the Savoy Theatre with friends, assuming that Sullivan had reserved some seats for him. Instead, he was informed that Sullivan objected to his presence. The composer later denied that this was true.<ref name=Ford/> The last time they met was at the Savoy Theatre on 17 November 1898 at the celebration of the 21st anniversary of the first performance of ''The Sorcerer''.

Gilbert also wrote several works, some with other collaborators, in the 1890s.

Gilbert went into semi-retirement, although he continued to direct revivals of the Savoy Operas and wrote new plays occasionally. Between 1906 and 1909, he assisted Mrs. Carte in staging two repertory seasons at the Savoy Theatre. These were very popular and revived interest in the works.<ref>Joseph, p. 146</ref> Gilbert was knighted during the first repertory season.<ref>Wilson and Lloyd, p. 83</ref> After Sullivan's death, Gilbert wrote only one more comic opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909; music by [[Edward German]]), which was not a success.<ref name=Ford/><ref>Baily, p. 425</ref>\n\n==Legacy and assessment==\nGilbert died in 1911, and Richard's son, [[Rupert D'Oyly Carte]], took over the opera company upon his step-mother's death in 1913.

His orchestration is delightful: he wrote with full understanding of every orchestral voice. Above all, his music is perfectly appropriate to the words of which it is the setting.... He found the right, the only cadences to fit Gilbert's happy and original rhythms, and to match Gilbert's fun or to throw Gilbert's frequent irony, pointed although not savage, into relief. Sullivan's music is much more than the accompaniment of Gilbert's libretti, just as Gilbert's libretti are far more than words to Sullivan's music. We have two masters who are playing a concerto. Neither is subordinate to the other; each gives what is original, but the two, while neither predominates, are in perfect correspondence. This rare harmony of words and music is what makes these operas entirely unique. They are the work not of a musician and his librettist nor of a poet and one who sets his words to music, but of two geniuses.<ref>[[Henry Wood|Wood, Henry]].[http://gsarchive.net/books/walbrook/foreword.html Foreword] in Walbrook</ref>}}\n\n[[G. K. Chesterton]] similarly praised the combination of the two artists, anticipating the operas' success into the \"remote future\". He wrote that Gilbert's satire was \"too intelligent to be intelligible\" by itself, and that perhaps only Sullivan could have given \"wings to his words ... in exactly the right degree frivolous and exactly the right degree fastidious. [The words'] precise degree of levity and distance from reality ... seemed to be expressed ... in the very notes of the music; almost ... in the note of the laughter that followed it.\"<ref>Chesterton, G. K., introduction to Godwin, Augustine Henry. ''Gilbert & Sullivan: A Critical Appreciation of the Savoy Operas'', E.P. Dutton & Co (1926)</ref> In 1957, a review in ''The Times'' gave this rationale for \"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\":\n{{quote|\"[T]hey were never really contemporary in their idiom.... Gilbert and Sullivan's [world], from the first moment was obviously not the audience's world, [it was] an artificial world, with a neatly controlled and shapely precision which has not gone out of fashion \u2013 because it was never in fashion in the sense of using the fleeting conventions and ways of thought of contemporary human society.... For this, each partner has his share of credit. The neat articulation of incredibilities in Gilbert's plots is perfectly matched by his language.... His dialogue, with its primly mocking formality, satisfies both the ear and the intelligence. His verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording.... How deliciously [his lines] prick the bubble of sentiment.... [Of] equal importance... Gilbert's lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music.... Sullivan's tunes, in these operas, also exist in a make-believe world of their own.... [He is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody.... The two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful.... Light, and even trifling, though [the operas] may seem upon grave consideration, they yet have the shapeliness and elegance that can make a trifle into a work of art\".<ref>\"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan: Operas of an Artificial World\", ''The Times'', 14 February 1957, p. 5</ref>}}\n\nBecause of the unusual success of the operas, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company were<!--British usage--> able, from the start, to license the works to other professional companies, such as the [[J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Company]], and to amateur troupes. For almost a century, until the British copyrights expired at the end of 1961, and even afterwards, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company influenced productions of the operas worldwide, creating a \"performing tradition\" for most of the operas that is still referred to today by many directors, both amateur and professional.<ref name=JoyRapture>Bradley, Ian. ''Oh Joy! Oh Rapture! The Enduring Phenomenon of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (2005)</ref> Indeed, Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte had an important influence on amateur theatre. Cellier and Bridgeman wrote in 1914 that, prior to the creation of the [[Savoy opera]]s, amateur actors were treated with contempt by professionals. After the formation of amateur Gilbert and Sullivan companies in the 1880s licensed to perform the operas, professionals recognised that the amateur performing groups \"support the culture of music and the drama. They are now accepted as useful training schools for the legitimate stage, and from the volunteer ranks have sprung many present-day favourites.\"<ref>Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 393</ref> Cellier and Bridgeman attributed the rise in quality and reputation of the amateur groups largely to \"the popularity of, and infectious craze for performing, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas\".<ref>Cellier and Bridgeman, p. 394</ref> The [[National Operatic and Dramatic Association]] (NODA) was founded in 1899. It reported, in 1914, that nearly 200 British troupes were performing Gilbert and Sullivan that year, constituting most of the amateur companies in the country (this figure included only the societies that were members of NODA). The association further reported that almost 1,000 performances of the [[Savoy opera]]s had been given in Britain that year, many of them to benefit charities.<ref>Cellier and Bridgeman, pp. 394\u201396</ref> Cellier and Bridgeman noted that strong amateur groups were performing the operas in places as far away as New Zealand.<ref>Cellier and Bridgeman, pp. 398\u201399</ref> In the U.S., and elsewhere where British copyrights on the operas were not enforced, both professional and amateur companies performed the works throughout the 20th century \u2013 the [[Internet Broadway Database]] counts about 150 productions on Broadway alone from 1900 to 1960.

Common themes in the strip include Garfield's laziness, obsessive eating, coffee, and disdain of Mondays and diets. The strip's focus is mostly on the interactions among Garfield, Jon, and Odie, but other recurring minor characters appear as well. Originally created with the intentions to \"come up with a good, marketable character\",<ref name=\"slatewhyhate\"/> ''Garfield'' has spawned merchandise earning $750 million to $1 billion annually. In addition to the various merchandise and commercial tie-ins, the strip has spawned several animated television specials, two animated television series, two theatrical feature-length live-action/CGI animated films, and three fully CGI animated direct-to-video movies.\n\nPart of the strip's broad pop cultural appeal is due to its lack of [[social commentary|social]] or [[political commentary#Political cartoons|political]] commentary; though this was Davis's original intention, he also admitted that his \"grasp of politics isn't strong,\" joking that, for many years, he thought \"[[OPEC]] was a [[dental bonding|denture adhesive]]\".<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,283648,00.html | title=Tales of the Kitty | first=Beth | last=Johnson | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | accessdate=August 4, 2008 | date=June 19, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://star-ecentral.com/news/story.asp?file=/2005/11/5/movies/12462084&sec=movies | title=Everybody loves Garfield| work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] | accessdate=August 4, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the 1970s, Davis created a comic strip called ''[[Gnorm Gnat]]'', which met with little success. One editor said, \"his art was good, his gags were great,\" but that \"nobody can identify with bugs.\" Davis decided to take a long, hard look at the comics and he saw that dogs were doing very well, but there were no cats at the time. Davis figured that since he had grown up on a farm with 25 cats that he could come up with a strip based on a cat. He then proceeded to create a new strip with a cat as its main character and thus created Garfield, who borrows the first letter of his name from Davis's earlier work.<ref name=\"Twenty\">Davis. ''20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection''. p. 14.</ref> ''Garfield'' originally consisted of four main characters. Garfield, the titular character, was based on the cats Davis was around growing up; he took his name and personality from Davis's grandfather, James A.

Jon Arbuckle came from a 1950s coffee commercial, and Odie was based on a car dealership commercial written by Davis, which featured Odie the Village Idiot. Early on in the strip, Odie's owner was a man named Lyman. He was written in to give Jon someone to talk with. Davis later realized that Garfield and Jon could \"communicate nonverbally\". The strip, originally centered on Jon, was first rejected by the [[King Features Syndicate|King Features]], [[Post-Hall Syndicate|Post-Hall]] and the [[Chicago Tribune]]-[[Daily News (New York)|New York News]] agencies, all of which asked Davis to focus on the cat, who in their opinion, got the better lines.

''Garfield'' was one of the strips featured, introduced as a newcomer (the strip was only two years old at the time). From 1982 to 1991, twelve primetime ''Garfield'' cartoon specials and one hour-long primetime documentary celebrating the character's 10th anniversary were aired; [[Lorenzo Music]] voiced Garfield in all of them. A Saturday morning cartoon show, ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'', aired for seven seasons from 1988 to 1994; this adaption also starred Music as the voice of Garfield. ''[[The Garfield Show]]'', a [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] series, started development in 2007 to coincide with the strip's 30th anniversary the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=23758|title=New CG Garfield To Air On Cartoon Network|date=June 26, 2008|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=January 5, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305215116/http://news.awn.com/index.php?ltype=top&newsitem_no=23758|archivedate=March 5, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It premiered in France in December 2008 and made its U.S. debut on [[Cartoon Network]] on November 2, 2009.\n\n====Primetime specials====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He is known for saying \"breathing is exercise\".\n\nThough Garfield can be very cynical, he does have a soft side for his teddy bear, Pooky, food and sleep, and one Christmas he says, \"they say I have to get up early, be nice to people, skip breakfast ... I wish it would never end.\"\nHowever, in the feature film ''[[Garfield Gets Real]]'' and its sequels, Garfield is better behaved, friendlier towards Jon and Odie, less self-centered, and more sympathetic.\n\nIt has been wondered by many readers if Garfield can actually be understood by the human characters around him. Sometimes, it seems like Jon can hear him. However, it is mentioned in more than one strip that Jon cannot understand Garfield.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904152923/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2009/08/15 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 4, 2014 | title=Garfield | date=August 15, 2009 | publisher=Gocomics.com | accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> However, in the feature film [[Garfield Gets Real]] and its sequels, Garfield and the other animals save for Odie are able to talk to, and be understood by, Jon and the other humans.

The appearance in 1979 claimed it to be his first birthday, although in the first appearance of the strip (19 June 1978), he was portrayed as a fully-grown cat, implying that the birthday is of the strip itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics|title=Garfield Comics| date=February 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Jon Arbuckle===\n'''First appearance: June 19, 1978'''\n\n{{quote box|quote=''Jon:'' Here's my sixth-grade report card.

Arbuckle)]] is Garfield's owner, usually depicted as an awkward clumsy [[geek]] who has trouble finding a date.  Jon had a crush on Liz (Garfield's veterinarian) and is now dating her. Jon disapproves of Garfield's \"don't care, not interested,\" attitude, and  often encourages his pet to take an interest in the world around him, sometimes stating an interesting fact, or asking a philosophical question in an attempt to prompt Garfield into thought, Garfield tends to brush this off with a simple, yet logical remark, and despite the trouble Garfield causes, Jon has a heart of gold and is very tolerant of Garfield's shortcomings, a fact which Garfield often takes advantage of.  In the December 23, 1980 strip, Jon states that he is thirty years old (nominally meaning he should presently be in his sixties, although he has not aged physically). His birthday is July 28.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808190758/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2005/07/28 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 8, 2016 | title=Garfield | date=July 28, 2005 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808210333/http://www.gocomics.com/mobile/garfield/2008/07/28 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=August 8, 2016 | title=Garfield | date=July 28, 2008 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nJon loves (or occasionally hates) Garfield and all cats. Many gags focus on this; his inability to get a date is usually attributed to his lack of social skills, his poor taste in clothes (Garfield remarked in one strip after seeing his closet that \"two hundred moths committed suicide\";<ref>{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2002/ga020110.gif | title=Garfield | date=January 10, 2002 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}</ref> in another, the \"geek police\" ordered Jon to \"throw out his tie\"),<ref>{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890811.gif | title=Garfield | date=August 11, 1989 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}</ref> and his eccentric interests which range from stamp collecting to measuring the growth of his toenails to watching movies with \"[[polka]] [[ninja]]s\".

It was implied that Jon is inspired by a drawing of Davis himself when he was first drawing the strip.

He was originally owned by Jon's friend [[List of characters in Garfield#Lyman|Lyman]], though Jon adopted him after Lyman was written out of the strip. The book ''Garfield: His 9 Lives'' (1984) [[retcons]] Odie's origin: there is no mention of Lyman, and Odie was a puppy when he was acquired by Jon as company for Garfield (when Garfield was a kitten). Odie is younger than Garfield and usually portrayed as na\u00efve, happy, affectionate and blissfully unaware of Garfield's cynical, sadistic nature, despite the physical abuse Garfield exhibits toward him, including regularly kicking him off the kitchen table or tricking him into going over the edge himself. On some occasions, however, he is depicted more intelligently, as one strip, in which he holds a heavy rock to prevent Garfield from doing this, and actually hurts Garfield's foot. In one strip when Garfield and Jon are out of the house, Odie is seen reading ''[[War and Peace]]'' and watching a television program, ''An Evening With Mozart''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1989/ga890427.gif | title=Garfield | date=April 27, 1989 | publisher=Garfield.com | accessdate=July 26, 2008}}</ref> Odie has only talked once.

She has a somewhat deadpan, sardonic persona and almost always reacts negatively to Jon's outlandish and goofball behavior but can even find it endearing on occasion. Jon often attempted to ask her out on a date, but rarely succeeded; however, in an extended story arc from June 19 to July 29, 2006 (the main event on July 28), Liz and Jon kiss. Now, they are a couple.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728 |title=Garfield's Comic Strip Archives at Garfield.com \u2013 The Official Web Site of Garfield & Friends |publisher=Garfield.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072545/http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2006&addr=060728 |archivedate=July 11, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring subjects and themes==\nMany of the gags focus on Garfield's obsessive eating and obesity; his dislike of spiders; his hatred of Mondays, diets, and any form of exertion; his constant shedding (which annoys Jon); and his abuse of Odie and Jon as well as his obsession with mailing Nermal to [[Abu Dhabi]], or simply throwing ''through'' the front door. Though he will eat nearly anything (with the exception of [[raisin]]s and [[spinach]]), Garfield is particularly fond of [[lasagna]]; he also enjoys eating Jon's houseplants and other pets (mainly birds and fish). He also has odd relationships with household pests; Garfield generally spares mice, and even cooperates with them to cause mischief (much to Jon's chagrin), but will readily swat or pound spiders flat. Other gags focus on Jon's poor social skills and inability to get a date; before he started dating Liz, he often tried to get dates, usually without success (in one strip, after failing to get a date with \"Nancy\", he tries getting a date with her mother and grandmother; he ended up getting \"shot down by three generations\").<ref>{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1996/ga960614.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = June 14, 1996 | accessdate=August 5, 2008}}</ref> When he does get a date, it usually goes awry; Jon's dates have slashed his tires, been tranquilized, and called the police when he stuck carrots in his ears. The storylines featuring Jon's dates rarely appear now. Before, he had dates with many odd characters, whereas now, he exclusively dates Liz.\n\nGarfield's world has specific locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, a place he loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food is the center of most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently hugged her. Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his [[tractor]] (which he [[double parking|double-parked]]) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon takes Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to.<ref name=\"The Garfield Vault Strip\">{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/2007/ga070819.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = August 19, 2007 | accessdate = June 6, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}</ref> Frequently, the characters break the [[fourth wall]], mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out),<ref>{{cite web| url = http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1992/ga920125.gif | title = The Garfield Vault Strip | date = January 25, 1992 | accessdate = June 21, 2008|work = Garfield.com}}</ref> or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed.

They sometimes are waited on by the Italian Armando, who is refined and sophisticated and shows a great loathing towards Jon, presumably for his immature and uncouth behavior at the prestigious eatery. On other occasions, the couple receives a different waiter, such as a large ogre-like man who intimidates Jon when he is about to report a complaint about the food.\n\nAnother commonly recurring character, although hardly ever seen, is Jon's neighbor, Mrs. Feeny. Garfield seems to take both enormous pride and excess zeal in doing whatever it takes to harass her, to the point the she even erects an electric fence (which of course, does not stop him).\n\nOther unique themes are things like \"Garfield's Believe it or Don't\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's Believe it, or DON'T |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+Believe+it%2C+or+DON%27T%21|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712032111/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+Believe+it,+or+DON'T!|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=Jim Davis (cartoonist)|date=January 20, 1986}}</ref> \"Garfield's Law\",<ref>{{cite web|title= Garfield's law |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+law|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710084143/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+law|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 10, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=|date=November 8, 1982}}</ref> \"Garfield's History of Dogs\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield Comic Strips September 1980 |url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120708094750/http://garfield.nfshost.com/1980/09/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 8, 2012|publisher=garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=15 April 2012|author=Jim Davis|authorlink=|date=September 1, 1980}}</ref> and \"Garfield's History of Cats\",<ref>{{cite web|title=Garfield's history of cats garfield.nfshost.com :: search garfield|url=http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield%27s+history+of+cats|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709072827/http://garfield.nfshost.com/?s=Garfield's+history+of+cats|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 9, 2012|publisher=Garfield.nfshost.com|accessdate=April 15, 2012|author=Jim Davis|date=August 6, 1979}}</ref> which show science, history, and the world from Garfield's point of view. Another particular theme is \"National Fat Week\", where Garfield spends the week making fun of skinny people. Also, there was a storyline involving Garfield catching Odie eating his food and \"kicking Odie into next week\".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://images.ucomics.com/comics/ga/1984/ga840629.gif | title=The Garfield Vault Strip | date=June 29, 1984 | accessdate=June 6, 2008|publisher=Garfield.com}}</ref> Soon, Garfield realizes that \"Lunch isn't the same without Odie.

Two particular examples are Lillian, an eccentric (and very nearsighted) old lady with odd quirks, and Greta, a muscle bound woman who was hired to look after the pets during New Year's Eve. Most of December is spent preparing for Christmas, with a predictable focus on presents. Other Christmas themed strips include Jon's attempts at decorating the tree and house, or the attempt to buy the tree. Some years, the Christmas strips started as early as the end of November. Another example is \"Splut Week\", when Garfield tries to avoid pies that are thrown at him. For most of Garfield's history, being hit with a pie has inevitably resulted in the onomatopoeia \"splut\", hence the name.\n\nEvery week before June 19, the strip focuses on Garfield's birthday, which he dreads because of his fear of getting older. This started happening after his sixth birthday. However, before his 29th birthday, Liz put Garfield on a diet. On June 19, 2007, Garfield was given the greatest birthday present: \"I'M OFF MY DIET!\" Occasionally the strip celebrates Halloween as well with scary-themed jokes, such as mask gags. There are also seasonal jokes, with snow-related gags common in January or February and beach- or heat-themed jokes in the summer.\n\n[[File:Garfield 1989-10-27 right panel.png|frame|Right panel of October 27, 1989 strip.]]\n\nOne storyline, which ran the week before [[Halloween]] in 1989 ([http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/23/ Oct 23] to [http://www.gocomics.com/garfield/1989/10/28/ Oct 28]), is unique among Garfield strips in that it is not meant to be humorous.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/its-not-just-you-garfield-is-not-meant-to-be-funny-6199556/ | title = It's Not Just You: Garfield Is Not Meant to Be Funny | date = 20 March 2013 | accessdate = 29 April 2018 | publisher = ''Smithsonian Magazine'' | author = Rose Eveleth }}</ref> It depicts Garfield awakening in a future in which the house is abandoned and he no longer exists. In Garfield's ''Twentieth Anniversary Collection'', in which the strips are reprinted, Jim Davis discusses the genesis for this series:\n\n{{quote|During a writing session for Halloween, I got the idea for this decidedly different series of strips. I wanted to scare people. And what do people fear most? Why, being alone. We carried out the concept to its logical conclusion and got a lot of responses from readers. Reaction ranged from 'Right on!' to 'This isn't a trend, is it?'}}\n\nOne of the recurring storylines involves Garfield getting lost or running away. The longest one of these lasted for over a month (in 1986 August 25 to September 28); it began with Jon telling Garfield to go get the newspaper. Garfield walks outside to get it, but speculates about what will happen if he wanders off \u2013 and decides to find out. Jon notices Garfield has been gone too long, so he sends Odie out to find him. He quickly realizes his mistake (Odie, being not too bright, also gets lost). Jon starts to get lonely, so he offers a reward for the return of Garfield and Odie. He is not descriptive, so animals including an elephant, [[monkey]]s, a [[Pinniped|seal]], a snake, a [[kangaroo]] and [[joey (marsupial)|joey]], and turtles are brought to Jon's house for the reward. After a series of events, including Odie being adopted by a small girl, both pets meeting up at a circus that they briefly joined, and both going to a pet shop, Garfield and Odie make it back home.\n\nAnother story involved Jon going away on a business trip around Christmas time, leaving Garfield a week's worth of food, which he devoured instantly. Garfield then leaves the house and gets locked out. He then reunites with his mother, and eventually makes it back home in the snow on Christmas Eve (1984 December 3 to 23). Part of this storyline was taken from the 1983 Emmy-winning special ''[[Garfield on the Town]]''.\n\n===Paws, Inc.===\nPaws, Inc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041020045311/http://www.send2press.com/PRnetwire/pr04_101203-nypaws.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=October 20, 2004 |title=Running Paws, Inc. \u2013 The Evolution of Dog Walking Reaches 100th Client \u2013 Business News from Send2Press Newswire 10/12/04 |publisher=Send2press.com |date=2004-10-12 |accessdate=2010-01-10 |df= }}</ref> was founded in 1981 by [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] to support the Garfield comic strip and its licensing.

In the strip, a spider who is about to be squashed by Garfield boasts that if he is squished, he will get a holiday in his remembrance. The next panel shows a classroom of spiders in which a teacher asks the students why spiders celebrate \"National Stupid Day,\" implying that the spider was squished.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2010&addr=101111|title=Garfield Comic Strip Archive|date=November 11, 2010|publisher=garfield.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114121219/http://garfield.com/comics/vault.html?yr=2010&addr=101111|archivedate=November 14, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Davis quickly apologized for the poorly timed comic strip, saying that it had been written a year in advance and that both his brother and son were veterans.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/11/12/garfield.ill.timed.comic/?hpt=T2 | work=CNN | title='Garfield' creator apologizes for ill-timed Veterans Day comic strip | date=November 12, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Primary sources===\n*{{Cite book| author=Davis, Jim| title=20 Years & Still Kicking!: Garfield's Twentieth Anniversary Collection.| publisher=New York: Ballantine Books| year=1998 | isbn=978-0-345-42126-5 }}\n*{{Cite book| author=Davis, Jim| title=In Dog Years I'd be Dead: Garfield at 25.| publisher=Random House, Incorporated| year=2004 | isbn=978-0-345-45204-7 }}\n\n===Secondary sources===\n*{{Cite book|title=Indiana Legends: Famous Hoosiers from Johnny Appleseed to David Letterman|first=Nelson|last=Price|publisher=Emmis Books|year=1997|isbn=978-1-57860-006-9}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Planet Cat: A Cat-alog|first=Sandra|last=Choron|last2=Choron|first2=Harry|last3=Moore|first3=Arden|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-618-81259-2}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Fashion & Merchandising Fads|first=Frank W.|last=Hoffmann|last2=Bailey|first2=William G.|publisher=[[Haworth Press]]|year=1994|ISBN=978-1-56023-031-1}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Cartoon Success Secrets: A Tribute to 30 Years of Cartoonist Profiles|first=Jud|last=Hurd|publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]|year=2004|ISBN=978-0-7407-3809-8}}\n*{{Cite book|title=The Cat and the Human Imagination: Feline Images from Bast to Garfield|first=Katharine M. |last=Rogers|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]|year=2001|ISBN=978-0-472-08750-1}}\n*{{Cite book|title=Indiana: Off the Beaten Path : a Guide to Unique Places|first=Phyllis|last=Thomas|publisher=Globe Pequot|year=2007|ISBN=978-0-7627-4414-5}}\n*{{Cite book|title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century|first=David|last=Mansour|publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]]|year=2005|ISBN=978-0-7407-5118-9}}\n*{{Cite book|title=1,001 Things You Always Wanted to Know about Cats|first=J.

He played authority figures such as the [[The Colonel (Monty Python)|Colonel]] and the lead role in two Python films, ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' (1975) and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]'' (1979).\n\nChapman was born in [[Leicester]] and was raised in [[Melton Mowbray]]. He enjoyed science, acting, and comedy, and after graduating from [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]], and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College]], he turned down a career as a doctor to be a comedian. Chapman eventually established a writing partnership with [[John Cleese]], which reached its critical peak with Monty Python in the 1970s. He subsequently left Britain for [[Los Angeles]], where he attempted to be a success on American television, speaking on the college circuit and producing the pirate film ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' (1983), before returning to Britain in the early 1980s.\n\nIn his personal life, Chapman was openly [[homosexual]] and a strong supporter of [[gay rights]], and was in a relationship with [[David Sherlock]]. He was an [[alcoholic]] during his time at Cambridge and the Python years, quitting shortly before working on ''Life of Brian''. He later became an enthusiast and patron of the [[Dangerous Sports Club]]. Chapman died of [[tonsil cancer]] on 4 October 1989, on the eve of Monty Python's 20th anniversary, and his life and legacy were commemorated at a private memorial service at St Bartholomew's with the other five Pythons.\n\n== Early life and education ==\n[[File:Graham Chapman blue plaque Melton.jpg|thumb|left|A [[blue plaque]] at Melton Mowbray Grammar School (now [[King Edward VII School (Melton Mowbray)|King Edward VII School]]), which Chapman attended]]\nGraham Arthur Chapman was born on 8 January 1941 at the Stoneygate Nursing Home, [[Stoneygate]], [[Leicester]], the son of policeman Walter Chapman and Edith Towers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/55386|title=Chapman, Graham (1941\u20131989), comedian and writer|publisher=oup.com|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/55386|year=2004}}</ref> He had an elder brother, John, who was born in 1936.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=3}} One of Chapman's earliest memories was seeing the remains of Polish airmen who had suffered an aeroplane accident near Leicester, later saying the horrific sights of this remained in his memory.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=1,7}}\n\nChapman was educated at [[King Edward VII School (Melton Mowbray)|Melton Mowbray Grammar School]].

Cleese later said he and Chapman believed that \"there was something very funny there, if we could find the right context for it\".{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=90\u201391}} The group felt that Chapman had the best acting skills in the group. Cleese complimented Chapman by saying that he was \"particularly a wonderful actor\".{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=154}}\n\nChapman played the lead role in two Python films, ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail|Holy Grail]]'' and ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian|Life of Brian]]''. He was chosen to play the lead in ''Holy Grail'' because of the group's respect towards his straight acting skills, and because the other members wanted to play lesser, funnier characters.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=185\u2013186}} Chapman did not mind being filmed fully nude in front of a crowd in ''Life of Brian'', but the scene, filmed in [[Tunisia]], caused problems with the female [[Muslim]] extras.{{sfn|Chapman|Yoakum|2006|p=17}}\n\n=== Other work ===\nChapman and [[Douglas Adams]] wrote a pilot for a TV series in 1975, ''[[Out of the Trees]]'', but it received poor ratings after being broadcast at the same time as ''[[Match of the Day]]'' and only the initial episode was produced.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=195}} In 1978, Chapman co-wrote the comedy film ''[[The Odd Job]]'' with McKenna, and starred as one of the main characters. Chapman wanted his friend [[Keith Moon]] to play a co-lead role alongside him, but Moon could not pass an acting test, so the part went to [[David Jason]] who had previously appeared on ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'' with Pythons Idle, Jones, and Palin. The film was moderately successful.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=207, 208}}\n\nDuring the 1970s, Chapman became increasingly concerned about the Python's income and finances. He moved to [[Los Angeles]] in the late 1970s to avoid British [[income tax]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=200}} He guest-starred on several television series including ''[[The Big Show (TV series)|The Big Show]]''.{{sfn|McCall|2013|p=75}}\n\nIn 1976, Chapman began writing a pirate film, ''[[Yellowbeard]]'' (1983), which came out of conversations between Chapman and Moon while in Los Angeles. Moon had always wanted to play [[Long John Silver]], so Chapman began to write a script for him.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=228}} Moon died in 1978 and the work stalled, eventually being rewritten by McKenna, then by [[Peter Cook]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|pp=234\u2013235}} The film, which starred Chapman as the eponymous pirate, also featured appearances from Cook, [[Marty Feldman]], Cleese, Idle, [[Spike Milligan]], and [[Cheech & Chong]].{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=236}} It marks the last appearance of Feldman, who suffered a fatal heart attack in December 1982.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=238}} The project was fraught with financial difficulties, and at times there was not enough money to pay the crew.{{sfn|McCabe|2005|p=237}} It was released to mixed reviews.

He became involved with the [[extreme sport]]s club [[Dangerous Sports Club]], which popularised [[bungee jumping]].

Small depressions on the upper jaw each contain a lone stiff hair, but are only visible on close inspection. Its head's ventral surface lacks the numerous prominent furrows of the related rorquals, instead bearing two to five shallow furrows on the throat's underside. The gray whale also lacks a [[dorsal fin]], instead bearing 6 to 12 dorsal crenulations (\"knuckles\"), which are raised bumps on the midline of its rear quarter, leading to the [[fluke (tail)|fluke]]s. This is known as the [[dorsal ridge]]. The tail itself is {{convert|3|-|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} across and deeply notched at the center while its edges taper to a point.\n\n===Pacific groups===\nThe two populations of Pacific gray whales (east and west) are morphologically and phylogenically different. Other than DNA structures, differences in proportions of several body parts and body colors including skeletal features, and length ratios of flippers and baleen plates have been confirmed between Eastern and Western populations, and some claims that the original eastern and western groups could have been much more distinct than previously thought, enough to be counted as subspecies.<ref name=SC65bBRG12 /><ref name=GrayJapan>{{Cite journal|author1=Nakamura G.|author2=Kato H.|title=\u65e5\u672c\u6cbf\u5cb8\u57df\u306b\u8fd1\u5e74\uff081990\u20132005 \u5e74\uff09\u51fa\u73fe\u3057\u305f\u30b3\u30af\u30af\u30b8\u30e9Eschrichtius robustus \u306e\u9aa8\u5b66\u7684\u7279\u5fb4\uff0c\u7279\u306b\u982d\u9aa8\u5f62\u72b6\u304b\u3089\u898b\u305f\u5317\u592a\u5e73\u6d0b\u897f\u90e8\u7cfb\u7fa4\u3068\u6771\u90e8\u7cfb\u7fa4\u4ea4\u6d41\u306e\u53ef\u80fd\u6027|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/mammalianscience/54/1/54_73/_article/-char/ja/|journal=\u54fa\u4e73\u985e\u79d1\u5b66\u3000 |volume=54 |issue=1 |year=2014|pages=73\u201388|publisher=The Mammal Society of Japan,  Cetacean Research Laboratory in Marine environmental section in the Graduate School of [[Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology]], [[J-STAGE]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2015-01-16}}</ref> Since the original Asian and Atlantic populations have become extinct, it is difficult to determine the unique features among whales in these stocks.

The three most popular are [[San Ignacio Lagoon|San Ignacio]], [[Magdalena Bay]] to the south, and, to the north, [[Laguna Ojo de Liebre]] (formerly known in English as Scammon's Lagoon after whaleman [[Charles Melville Scammon]], who discovered the lagoons in the 1850s and hunted the grays).<ref>{{cite web|title=Recovery of the Gray Whale\n|author=Davis, T.N.|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF3/339.html|publisher=Alaska Science Forum|date=1979-09-06|accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Baja Legends|author=Niemann, G.|pages=171\u2013173|url=https://books.google.com/?id=35WQOduN1F4C&pg=PA171|year=2002|publisher=Sunbelt Publications|isbn=0-932653-47-2}}</ref>\n\nGray whales once ranged into [[Sea of Cortez]] and Pacific coasts of continental Mexico south to the [[Islas Mar\u00edas]], [[Bah\u00eda de Banderas]], and [[Nayarit]]/[[Jalisco]], and there were two modern calving grounds in [[Sonora]] ([[Tojahui]] or [[Yavaros]]) and [[Sinaloa]] ([[Bahia Santa Maria]]) until being abandoned in 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Findley|first1= T.L.|last2= Vidal|first2= O.|year= 2002|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285118962_Gray_whale_Eschrichtius_robustus_at_calving_sites_in_the_Gulf_of_California_Mexico|title= Gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus) at calving sites in the Gulf of California, M\u00e9xico|journal= Journal of Cetacean Research and Management|volume =4|issue=1|pages=27\u201340}}</ref>\n\nThese first whales to arrive are usually pregnant mothers looking for the protection of the lagoons to bear their calves, along with single females seeking mates. By mid-February to mid-March, the bulk of the population has arrived in the lagoons, filling them with nursing, calving and mating gray whales.\n\nThroughout February and March, the first to leave the lagoons are males and females without new calves. Pregnant females and nursing mothers with their newborns are the last to depart, leaving only when their calves are ready for the journey, which is usually from late March to mid-April. Often, a few mothers linger with their young calves well into May.\n\nBy late March or early April, the returning animals can be seen from [[Everett, Washington]], to [[Puget Sound]] to Canada.\n\n=====Resident groups=====\n[[Image:Eschrichtius robustus Nootka 1.jpg|thumb|A gray whale swims near surf on [[Nootka Island]] within residential range.]]\nA population of about 200 gray whales stay along the eastern Pacific coast from Canada to California throughout the summer, not making the farther trip to Alaskan waters.

This hunt has been allowed under an \"aboriginal/subsistence whaling\" exception to the commercial-hunting ban. Anti-whaling groups have protested the hunt, saying the meat from the whales is not for traditional native consumption, but is used instead to feed animals in government-run fur farms; they cite annual catch numbers that rose dramatically during the 1940s, at the time when state-run fur farms were being established in the region. Although the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government denied these charges as recently as 1987, in recent years the Russian government has acknowledged the practice. The Russian IWC delegation has said that the hunt is justified under the aboriginal/subsistence exemption, since the fur farms provide a necessary economic base for the region's native population.\n\nCurrently, the annual quota for the gray whale catch in the region is 140 per year. Pursuant to an agreement between the United States and Russia, the [[Makah people|Makah]] tribe of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] claimed four whales from the IWC quota established at the 1997 meeting. With the exception of a single gray whale killed in 1999, the Makah people have been prevented from hunting by a series of legal challenges, culminating in a United States federal appeals court decision in December 2002 that required the [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] to prepare an [[Environmental Impact Statement]]. On September 8, 2007, five members of the Makah tribe shot a gray whale using high-powered rifles in spite of the decision. The whale died within 12 hours, sinking while heading out to sea.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003876011_whale09m.html |work=The Seattle Times |title=Gray whale shot, killed in rogue tribal hunt |first1=Lynda V. |last1=Mapes |first2=Keith |last2=Ervin |date=2007-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125234530/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003876011_whale09m.html |archivedate=2011-11-25 |df= }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2008, the IUCN regards the gray whale as being of \"Least Concern\" from a conservation perspective.

Folk stories of female jinn include stories such as the ''Jejhal Jiniri''. Although, due to the cultural influence, the concept of jinn may vary, all share some common features. The jinn are believed to live in societies resembling these of humans, practicing religion (including Islam, Christianity and Judaism), having emotions, needing to eat and drink, and can procreate and raise families. Additionally, they fear iron, generally appear in desolate or abandoned places, and are stronger and faster than humans.<ref name=\"Hughes, Thomas Patrick 1885. p.136\">Hughes, Thomas Patrick.

According to [[Ashari]], the existence of jinn can not be proven, because arguments concerning the existence of jinn are beyond human comprehension. Adepts of [[Ash\u02bfari theology]] explained jinn are invisible to humans, because they lack the appropriate sense organs to envision them.<ref>Amira El-Zein ''Islam, Arabs, and Intelligent World of the jinn'' Syracuse University Press 2009 {{ISBN|9780815650706}} page 22</ref> Critics argued, if jinn exist, their bodies must either be ethereal or made of solid material; if they were composed of the former, they would not able to do hard work, like carrying heavy stones. If they were composed of the latter, they would be visible to any human with functional eyes.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.33 (German)</ref> Critics therefore refused to believe in a literal reading on jinn in Islamic sacred texts, preferring to view them as \"unruly men\".<ref>Hughes, Thomas Patrick. ''Dictionary of Islam''. 1885. \"Genii\" p.134</ref> On the other hand, advocates of belief in jinn assert that God's creation can exceed the human mind; thus, jinn are beyond human understanding. Since they are mentioned in Islamic texts, scholars such as [[Ibn Taimiyya]] and [[Ibn Hazm]] prohibit the denial of jinn. They also refer to spirits and demons among the Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews to \"prove\" their existence.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.33 (German)</ref> Ibn Taymiyya believed the jinn to be generally \"ignorant, untruthful, oppressive and treacherous\".

According to Mas'udi, the jinn as described by traditional scholars, are not [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] false, but improbable. Jahiz states in his work [[Kitab al-Hayawan]] that loneliness induces humans to mind-games and wishful thinking, causing ''wasw\u0101s'' (whisperings in the mind, traditionally thought to be caused by [[Satan]]). If he is afraid, he may see things that are not real. These alleged appearances are told to other generations in bedtime stories and poems, and with children of the next generation growing up with such stories, when they are afraid or lonely, they remember these stories, encouraging their imaginations and causing another alleged sighting of jinn.<ref>Tobias N\u00fcnlist ''D\u00e4monenglaube im Islam'' Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co KG, 2015 {{ISBN|978-3-110-33168-4}} p.37 (German)</ref>\n\nLater [[Sufism|Sufi traditions]] related the meaning of jinn back to its origin \"something that is concealed from sights\", thus they were related to the hidden realm, including angels from the heavenly realm and the jinn from a sublunary realm.

''American Gods'' was also made into a TV series for the Starz television cable television network in 2017. The television adaptation also features a Jinni.\n\nThe protagonist of the [[Bartimaeus Sequence]] is a jinni, and the books have an established hierarchy that include other types of spirits: imps, foliots, djinn, afrits, and marids (to use the author's own spelling). In this interpretation, jinn and all other spirits are not physical beings, but are instead from another dimension of chaos called \"The Other Place\". To exist on Earth at all, magicians must summon sprits and force them to take some kind of form, something so alien that it causes all spirits pain. As a result, magicians must put measures in place to force spirits to do what they want in a form of magical slavery.\n\nIn the popular American television series, \"[[Supernatural]]\", the jinn (alternatively 'djinn' or 'genies') are used as a plot device and one of the supernatural beings that the main characters come in contact with.

It is often considered a [[dialect]] of southern [[Corsican language|Corsican]], or even a transitional language between [[Corsican language|Corsican]] and [[Sardinian language|Sardinian]].\n\nGallurese's morphology and vocabulary are close to those of [[Corsican language|Corsican]], in particular with the southern dialects of [[Sartene]] and [[Porto-Vecchio]], whereas its phonology and syntax are similar to those of Sardinian.<ref name=\"Palau\">[http://maxia-mail.doomby.com/medias/files/atti-convegno-palau-2014-def.pdf Atti Convegno Lingua Gallurese, Palau 2014]</ref> One third of Gallurese vocabulary is also influenced by [[Logudorese dialect|Logudorese]] Sardinian, [[Catalan language|Catalan]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=\"Palau\" />\n\nThe [[Sassarese language]], spoken in the area of [[Sassari]], shares similar transitional traits between [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]], Corsican and Sardinian.\n\n== Typical constitutional elements of Gallurese ==\n[[Image:Dialetti corsi.png|thumb|left|Corsican dialects, including Gallurese.]]\n*the plural form of nouns in ''-i'' (''ghjanni'' or ''polti'' 'doors') are like in Corsican and Italian, and not as in ''-s'' like in Sardinian (''jannas'', ''portas''), French, Spanish, Catalan, etc.\n* Latin 'll' has become ''-dd-'' (like ''casteddu, coraddu'' 'castle', 'coral'), the same as in Sardinian, southern Corsican and Sicilian (but ''castellu, corallu'' in northern Corsican);\n*''-r-'' modified to ''-l-'' (''poltu'' 'port', while ''portu'' in Corsican and Sardinian);\n*''-chj-'' and ''-ghj-'' sounds (''ghjesgia'' 'church', ''occhji'' 'eyes'), like in Corsican, while Sardinian is ''cresia, ogros''.\n* articles ''lu'', ''la'', ''li'', like in ancient Corsican dialects (''u'', ''a'', ''i'' in modern Corsican, ''su'', ''sa'', ''sos'', ''sas'' in Sardinian);\n\n== Relation to Corsican ==\nGallurese is classified by some linguists as a dialect of Corsican,<ref>Blasco Ferrer

deal of similarity exists between [[Corsican language|Southern Corsican dialects]] and Gallurese, while there is relatively more distance from the neighbouring [[Sardo logudorese|Sardinian varieties]].\n\nThe [[Sardinia#Government and politics|Regional Government of Sardinia]] has recognized Gallurese, along with [[Sassarese language|Sassarese]] as separate languages, distinct from

History ==\n\nThe most ancient literary sources in Gallurese date back to the early 17th century, mainly as poetry and religious odes. Some late Middle Age fragments suggest that the formation of the language could be dated to the early 15th century. The origin and the development of Gallurese are debated. [[Max Leopold Wagner]] and [[Maurice Le Lannou]] argued that successive migration waves from Southern [[Corsica]], promoted under the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] rule to repopulate an area devastated by famine and pandemics, were crucial in the formation of a slightly hybridized version of Corsican.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Sardinia]]\n* [[Corsican language]]\n* [[Sassarese]]\n* [[Sardinian language]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n*Maxia, Mauro.

For both groups, much of the appeal lies in the [[quest]], either to trace the origin of the puzzle or compile a complete list of words ending in -gry.\n\nMore recently, the word ''hangry''\u2014a [[portmanteau]] of 'hungry' and 'angry'\u2014has been used to refer to an irritable state induced by lack of food.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Salis|first1=Amanda|title=The science of 'hangry:' Why some people get grumpy when they're hungry|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/20/health/science-behind-being-hangry/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 May 2016|date=July 20, 2015}}</ref>  Oxford Dictionaries (controlled by, but more lax than, the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]) added ''hangry'' on 27 August 2015,<ref>http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/press-releases/oxforddictionaries-com-quarterly-update-new-words-added-today-include-hangry-grexit-and-wine-oclock/</ref><ref>http://time.com/4010748/oxford-dictionary-update-2015/</ref><ref>http://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/hangry-wine-o-clock-new-food-words-oxford-dictionary-story.html</ref> and the full Oxford English Dictionary added ''hangry'' in 2018.<ref>https://public.oed.com/blog/january-2018-update-new-words-notes/</ref>\n\n==History==\nThere are anecdotal reports of various forms of the puzzle dating to the 1950s or earlier; the ultimate origin is presumably an oral tradition or a lost book of puzzles.<ref>\n\"[http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/gry.htm I Spy Gry!]\", ''World Wide Words,'' [[Michael Quinion]], page created 26 Oct. 1996, sast updated: 19 May 2001</ref> However, the first documented evidence is from early 1975 in the [[New York metropolitan area]], and the puzzle rapidly gained popularity in this year. The most likely source is the talk show of [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]], from some program in early or mid March 1975.\n\n[[Merriam-Webster]], publishers of the leading American dictionaries, first heard of this puzzle in a letter dated March 17, 1975, from Patricia Lasker of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Lasker says her plant manager heard the question on an unnamed [[quiz show]]. Since that time Merriam-Webster has received about four letters each year<ref name=\"cole\"/> asking the question.\n\nThe puzzle first appears in print in Anita Richterman's \"Problem Line\" column in ''[[Newsday]]'' on April 29, 1975. One \"M.Z.\" from [[Wantagh, New York]] states that the problem was asked on a TV quiz program. Richterman states that she asked a learned professor of English for help when she first received the inquiry, and he did not respond for over a month. This agrees with the Merriam-Webster report, suggesting a quiz show in early or mid March 1975.\n\nIn Anita Richterman's column on May 9, 1975, several correspondents reported that they had heard the puzzle on the [[Bob Grant (radio host)|Bob Grant]] radio talk show on [[WMCA (AM)|WMCA]] in New York City. This suggests either that the earlier claims of a (TV) quiz show confused a talk show with a quiz show, or that there was another unspecified quiz show that was then repeated by Grant.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Origin of the -Gry Problem |author=Chris Cole |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4538&context=wordways |journal=Word Ways |volume=34 |issue=1 |year=2012 }}</ref> The majority of readers gave the answer \"[[wikt:gry|gry]],\" an obsolete unit of measure invented by [[John Locke]]. It is unclear whether this was the answer given on the Grant show, or what the precise wording had been.\n\nBy fall 1975 the puzzle had reached the Delaware Valley, again apparently by radio, by which time the puzzle seems to have mutated to a form in which the missing word is an adjective that describes the state of the world.{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"A Philadelphia Story\", pp. 43\u201344}}\n\nThe puzzle has had occasional bouts of popularity: after its initial popularity in 1975, it was popular in 1978, then again in 1995\u20131996.<ref>''[[Stumpers-L]]'', Good Gry-f!

This took various forms, sometimes simply listing all words or all common words,<ref name=\"nandq\"/><ref>''The Brooklyn Magazine,'' Volumes II, Number 2, 1885, May, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9KbQAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA85&dq=dous+tremendous+stupendous+hazardous+horrendous+jeopardous p. 85]</ref> sometimes being posed as a riddle, giving the three common words, ''[[wikt:tremendous|tremendous]]'', ''[[wikt:stupendous|stupendous]]'', and ''[[wikt:hazardous|hazardous]]'', and requesting the rarer fourth, which is ''[[wikt:jeopardous|jeopardous]]''. This form originated in 1883, with an A.A. of Glasgow writing to [[George Augustus Henry Sala]] in his \"Echoes of the Week\" column in the ''[[Illustrated London News]].''<ref>Collected in ''Echoes of the year Eighteen Hundred and Eighty-Three,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=x6YIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA337&dq=dous+tremendous+stupendous p. 337]</ref><ref>See credit of Sala in ''Tidbits,'' 1884 February 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=sj85AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA246&dq=dous+tremendous+stupendous p. 246]; reprint: [https://books.google.com/books?id=vPgIAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA327&dq=dous+hazardous+tremendous p. 327]</ref>\nThis question has had enduring popularity,<ref>''Graphite,'' 1909 March, \"'Dous' Sequel\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=sZzmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA1976&dq=tremendous+stupendous+dous p. 1076]</ref> even inspiring a contest,<ref name=\"spatula\">''The Spatula,'' Volume 2, 1895, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nxVOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA360&dq=dous+tremendous+stupendous p. 360]</ref> though the words have proven less stable: today ''jeopardous'' is considered too rare, and the formerly unpopular ''[[wikt:horrendous|horrendous]]'' has taken its place; this change occurred as early as 1909.<ref name=\"eandp\">Editor and Publisher, Volume 9, 1909, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7yVDAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA18-IA89&dq=tremendous+stupendous+hazardous+dous p. 89]</ref> At times other words such as ''[[wikt:hybridous|hybridous]]'' have been accepted.<ref name=\"spatula\"/> Today ''[[wikt:hazardous|hazardous]]'' is typically the omitted word, and differs from the others in being a visible compound ''[[wikt:hazard|hazard]]'' + ''[[wikt:-ous|-ous]].'' This puzzle has continued in popularity through the end of the 20th century,<ref>''The Game of Words,'' Willard Epsy, 1971</ref>{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"Kickshaws: An Earlier Kickshaw\", [https://books.google.com/books?id=9IgsAAAAMAAJ&q=tremendous+stupendous p. 40]}} with recent versions giving it as an alternative to the gry puzzle.<ref>''The Word Circus: A Letter-perfect Book,'' by Richard Lederer, Dave Morice, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wHlHFp9zG1wC&pg=PA229 p. 229]</ref>\n\nAnother similar one is words ending in ''-cion'', of which the common words are ''[[wikt:coercion|coercion]]'', ''[[wikt:scion|scion]]'', and ''[[wikt:suspicion|suspicion]]''.<ref name=\"nandq\">''Notes and Queries,'' Vol. VI, No. 10, 1889, October, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0qYXAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA365&dq=cion p. 365]</ref><ref name=\"eandp\"/>\n\nThe most similar to the gry puzzle in form is to find three words that contain the letter sequence ''shion'', to which the answer is ''[[wikt:cushion|cu'''shion''']]'', ''[[wikt:fashion|fa'''shion''']]'', and ''[[wikt:parishioner|pari'''shion'''er]]'';  this is typically stated by giving ''cushion'' and ''fashion'', and requesting the third word, namely ''parishioner''.<ref name=\"lederer\"/><ref>''Weeds in the Garden of Words: Further Observations on the Tangled History of the English Language,'' Kate Burridge, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Iq9R_9AQ19gC&pg=PA82 p. 82], p. 184</ref> This can be modified to finding words ''ending'' with ''-shion'', in which case the answer is the obsolete word ''[[wikt:parishion|parishion]]'', which is a synonymous variant of ''parishioner''. This has not been nearly as popular as the gry puzzle.\n\n==Solution techniques==\nThe standard way to solve such puzzles is to use a [[reverse dictionary]], or to perform an exhaustive search through a dictionary, either manually, which is tedious and error-prone, or using computer tools such as [[grep]], which requires an electronic word list. At the origin of the gry puzzle, the standard reverse dictionary in modern English was the \"Air Force Reverse Dictionary\" (formally the ''Normal and Reverse Word List'', compiled under the direction of A. F. Brown), which did not have additional answers for gry. The most plausible answer at the time was ''[[wikt:meagry|meagry]]'', found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''.{{sfn|Beaman|1976|loc=\"A Philadelphia Story\", pp. 43\u201344}} A more elaborate strategy is to list words that have endings similar to gry, such as ''-gary'', and then search a larger dictionary for obsolete variants ending in ''-gry'', for example ''begry'' for ''beggary''.{{sfn|Scheetz|1989|p=198\u2013199}}\n\nFrom around 1980 electronic word lists became widely available on [[Unix]] systems, and searching for answers to the gry puzzle was an occasional benchmark; this also turned up ''gryphon'' in some cases, if match is not required to be at the end.<ref name=\"usenix1983\">USENIX Association, Software Tools User Group, Summer Conference Proceedings, Volume 2, 1983, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=5vsyVfOxHsGaNq7hgJgJ&id=47BQAAAAMAAJ&dq=gry p. 343]: One test was to find words containing the letter sequence \"gry.\" The \"grep gry /usr/dict/words\" ran significantly faster on the Concept than on the VAX (the words found were angry, hungry, and gryphon).</ref> This is now easily done in milliseconds on modern personal computers:\n<source lang=\"bash\">\ngrep gry$ /usr/share/dict/words  # Search for words ending in gry\ngrep gry /usr/share/dict/words  # Search for words containing gry\n</source>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |journal=[[Word Ways]] |volume=9 |issue=1 |date=February 1976  |first=Ralph G. |last=Beaman |title=Kickshaws |url=http://digitalcommons.butler.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1947&context=wordways |ref=harv }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Eckler, A.

His father, a doctor, was an advocate of the unification of Italy and was involved with the [[Carbonari]]. Because of his politics, the family was forced to move several times during Carducci's childhood, eventually settling for a few years in [[Florence]].<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Carducci, Giosu\u00e8|volume=5}}</ref>\n\nFrom the time he was in college, he was fascinated with the restrained style of [[Greek Antiquity|Greek]] and [[Roman Antiquity]], and his mature work reflects a restrained classical style, often using the classical meters of such Latin poets as [[Horace]] and [[Virgil]]. He translated Book&nbsp;9 of [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' into Italian.\n\nHe graduated in 1856 from the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] and began teaching school. The following year, he published his first collection of poems, ''Rime''. These were difficult years for Carducci: his father died, and his brother committed suicide.\n\nIn 1859, he married Elvira Menicucci, and they had four children. He briefly taught Greek at a high school in [[Pistoia]], and then was appointed Italian professor at the university in [[Bologna]].

Therefore, in 1881 Carducci published his neoclassical poem dedicated to [[Satan]].\nCarducci was a popular lecturer and a fierce critic of literature and society. He was an atheist,<ref>Biagini, Mario, ''Giosu\u00e8 Carducci'', Mursia, 1976, p. 208.</ref> whose political views were vehemently hostile to Christianity generally and the Catholic Church in particular.\n\n<blockquote>I know neither truth of God nor peace with the Vatican or any priests.

The poem was composed in 1863 as a dinner party toast, published in 1865, then republished in 1869 by Bologna's radical newspaper, ''Il Popolo'', as a provocation timed to coincide with the First Vatican Council, a time when revolutionary fervor directed against the papacy was running high as republicans pressed both politically and militarily for an end of the Vatican\u2019s domination over the papal states.<ref>''Carducci, Giosu\u00e8, Selected Verse/ Giosu\u00e8 Carducci: edited with a translation, introduction and commentary by David H.

As a fairly rare phenomenon, the formation of geysers is due to particular [[hydrogeological]] conditions that exist only in a few places on Earth. Generally all geyser field sites are located near active [[volcanic]] areas, and the geyser effect is due to the proximity of [[magma]]. Generally, surface water works its way down to an average depth of around {{convert|2000|m|ft}} where it contacts hot rocks. The resultant boiling of the pressurized water results in the geyser effect of hot water and steam spraying out of the geyser's surface vent (a [[hydrothermal explosion]]).\n\nA geyser's eruptive activity may change or cease due to ongoing [[mineral]] [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] within the geyser plumbing, exchange of functions with nearby [[hot spring]]s, [[earthquake]] influences, and human intervention.<ref>Bryan, T.S. 1995</ref> Like many other natural phenomena, geysers are not unique to planet Earth.  Jet-like eruptions, often referred to as [[#Cryogeysers|cryogeysers]], have been observed on several of the [[Natural satellite|moons]] of the outer solar system. Due to the low ambient pressures, these eruptions consist of vapor without liquid; they are made more easily visible by particles of dust and ice carried aloft by the gas. Water vapor jets have been observed near the south pole of [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus]], while [[nitrogen]] eruptions have been observed on [[Neptune]]'s moon [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]. There are also signs of [[Geysers on Mars|carbon dioxide eruptions]] from the southern polar ice cap of [[Mars]]. In the latter two cases, instead of being driven by geothermal energy, the eruptions seem to rely on solar heating via a solid-state [[greenhouse effect]].\n\n== Form and function ==\n[[File:Steamboat Geyser in Yellowstone.jpg|alt=Water and steam erupting from rocky, barren ground. Fir trees in the background.|[[Steamboat Geyser]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]]|thumb|250px]]\n\nGeysers are temporary geological features. Geysers are generally associated with volcanic areas.<ref name=\"wyo\">[http://www.wyojones.com/how__geysers_form.htm How geysers form] Gregory L.</ref> As the water boils, the resulting pressure forces a superheated column of steam and water to the surface through the geyser's internal plumbing. The formation of geysers specifically requires the combination of three geologic conditions that are usually found in volcanic terrain.<ref name=\"wyo\" />\n\nThe heat needed for geyser formation comes from [[magma]] that needs to be close to the surface of the earth.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ljXMs4rkv3gC&pg=PA127&dq=heat+for+geyser+formation+comes+from+near+surface+magma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj21vfdw9DUAhUF2mMKHfB9CoQQ6AEIRzAH#v=onepage&q=heat%20for%20geyser%20formation%20comes%20from%20near%20surface%20magma&f=false|title=Quakes, Eruptions, and Other Geologic Cataclysms: Revealing the Earth's Hazards|last=Erickson|first=Jon|date=2014-05-14|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438109695|language=en}}</ref> In order for the heated water to form a geyser, a plumbing system made of [[fracture]]s, [[fissure]]s, porous spaces, and sometimes cavities is required. This includes a reservoir to hold the water while it is being heated. Geysers are generally aligned along faults.<ref name=\"wyo\" />\n\n== Eruptions ==\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width: 300px;\" \n|-\n|\n{| style=\"background: white; white-space: nowrap;\" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=2\n|-\n|[[File:geyser exploding 1 large.jpg|150px]]&thinsp;[[File:geyser exploding 2 large.jpg|150px]]\n|-\n|[[File:geyser exploding 4 large.jpg|150px]]&thinsp;[[File:geyser exploding 3 large.jpg|150px]]\n|}\n|-\n|[[Strokkur|Strokkur geyser]] erupting (clockwise from top left)\n# Steam rises from heated water\n# Pulses of water swell upward\n# Surface is broken\n# Ejected water spouts upward and falls back down into the pipe\n|}\n\nGeyser activity, like all hot spring activity, is caused by surface water gradually seeping down through the ground until it meets rock heated by [[magma]]. The [[geothermal (geology)|geothermally]] heated water then rises back toward the surface by [[convection]] through porous and fractured rocks. Geysers differ from non-eruptive hot springs in their subterranean structure; many consist of a small vent at the surface connected to one or more narrow tubes that lead to underground reservoirs of water and pressure tight rock.<ref name=\"leekry\">{{cite web |last=Krystek |first=Lee |url=http://www.unmuseum.org/geysers.htm |title=Weird Geology: Geysers] |publisher=Museum of Unnatural Mystery |accessdate=2008-03-28}}</ref>\n\nAs the geyser fills, the water at the top of the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, [[Convection|convective cooling]] of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike the lid of a [[pressure cooker]], allowing the water in the reservoir to become [[superheating|superheated]], i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.<ref name=\"leekry\" />\n\nUltimately, the temperatures near the bottom of the geyser rise to a point where boiling begins which forces steam bubbles to rise to the top of the column. As they burst through the geyser's vent, some water overflows or splashes out, reducing the weight of the column and thus the pressure on the water below. With this release of pressure, the superheated water flashes into [[steam]], boiling violently throughout the column. The resulting froth of expanding steam and hot water then sprays out of the geyser vent.<ref name=\"wyo\" /><ref>{{cite web |last=Lewin |first=Sarah |title = Instant Egghead: How do geysers erupt over and over? |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/instant-egghead-how-do-geysers-erupt-over-and-over |accessdate=2015-05-17 }}</ref>\n\nA key requirement that enables a geyser to erupt is a material called [[geyserite]] found in rocks nearby the geyser.  Geyserite\u2014mostly [[silicon dioxide]] (SiO<sub>2</sub>), is dissolved from the rocks and gets deposited on the walls of the geyser's plumbing system and on the surface. The deposits make the channels carrying the water up to the surface pressure-tight. This allows the pressure to be carried all the way to the top and not be leaked out into the loose gravel or soil that are normally under the geyser fields.<ref name=\"leekry\" />\n\nEventually the water remaining in the geyser cools back to below the boiling point and the eruption ends; heated groundwater begins seeping back into the reservoir, and the whole cycle begins again. The duration of eruptions and time between successive eruptions vary greatly from geyser to geyser; [[Strokkur]] in Iceland erupts for a few seconds every few minutes, while [[Grand Geyser]] in the United States erupts for up to 10&nbsp;minutes every 8\u201312&nbsp;hours.<ref name=\"leekry\" />\n\n== General categorization ==\n\nThere are two types of geysers: ''fountain geysers'' which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and ''cone geysers'' which erupt from cones or mounds of [[siliceous sinter]] (including [[geyserite]]), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes. [[Old Faithful Geyser|Old Faithful]], perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a cone geyser. [[Grand Geyser]], the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/dmonteit/ov_quick_guide.htm |title=Yellowstone thermal features |publisher=Yahoo! |date=2008-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116174629/http://www.geocities.com/dmonteit/ov_quick_guide.htm |archivedate=November 16, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n |direction = horizontal\n |align     = left\n |width1    = 202\n |width2    = 180\n |image1    = Fountain geyser.jpg\n |image2    = Old Faithful Geyser Yellowstone National Park.jpg\n |alt1      = Geyser erupts up and blows sideways from a pool.\n |alt2      = High geyser of water erupts out of the sparsely vegetated earth.\n |footer    = [[Fountain Geyser]] erupting from the pool (left) and [[Old Faithful geyser]] (cone geyser having mound of siliceous sinter) in [[Yellowstone National Park]] erupts approximately every 91 minutes (right).\n}}\n\nThere are many volcanic areas in the world that have [[hot spring]]s, [[mud pot]]s and [[fumarole]]s, but very few have erupting geysers. The main reason for their rarity is because multiple intense transient forces must occur simultaneously for a geyser to exist. For example, even when other necessary conditions exist, if the rock structure is loose, eruptions will erode the channels and rapidly destroy any nascent geysers.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nAs a result, most geysers form in places where there is volcanic [[rhyolite]] rock which dissolves in hot water and forms [[mineral]] deposits called siliceous sinter, or [[geyserite]], along the inside of the plumbing systems which are very slender. Over time, these deposits strengthen the channel walls by cementing the rock together tightly, thus enabling the geyser to persist, as mentioned in the previous section.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\nGeysers are fragile phenomena and if conditions change, they may go dormant or extinct. Many have been destroyed simply by people throwing debris into them while others have ceased to erupt due to dewatering by [[geothermal power]] plants. However, the [[Geysir|Great Geysir of Iceland]] has had periods of activity and dormancy. During its long dormant periods, eruptions were sometimes artificially induced\u2014often on special occasions\u2014by the addition of [[surfactant]]s to the water.{{cn|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Biology ==\n{{Further|Thermophile|Hyperthermophile}}\n[[File:Grand prismatic spring.jpg|alt=Surreal blue pool surround by orange border on a purple ground.|thumb|300px|Hyperthermophiles produce some of the bright colors of [[Grand Prismatic Spring]], Yellowstone National Park]]\n\nThe specific colours of geysers derive from the fact that despite the apparently harsh conditions, life is often found in them (and also in other hot [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]) in the form of [[thermophiles|thermophilic]] [[prokaryote]]s.

Geysers and hot springs are distributed all over the island. Many of the geysers are located in [[Haukadalur]]. Geysers are known to have existed in at least a dozen other areas on the island. ''[[The Great Geysir]]'', which first erupted in the 14th century, gave rise to the word ''[[wiktionary:geyser|geyser]]''. By 1896, Geysir was almost dormant before an earthquake that year caused eruptions to begin again, occurring several times a day, but in 1916, eruptions all but ceased. Throughout much of the 20th century, eruptions, usually following earthquakes, did happen from time to time. Some man-made improvements were made to the spring and eruptions were forced with soap on special occasions. Earthquakes in June 2000 subsequently reawakened the giant for a time but it is not currently erupting regularly. The nearby [[Strokkur]] geyser erupts every 5\u20138 minutes to a height of some {{convert|30|m}}.<ref name=\"uweb\" /><ref>Gardner Servian, Solveig [http://website.lineone.net/~polar.publishing/geysersoficeland.htm \"Geysers of Iceland\"] Retrieved on 2008-04-16</ref>\n\n=== Extinct and dormant geyser fields ===\n\nThere used to be two large geysers fields in [[Nevada]]\u2014[[Beowawe, Nevada|Beowawe]] and [[Steamboat Springs, Nevada|Steamboat Springs]]\u2014but they were destroyed by the installation of nearby geothermal power plants. At the plants, geothermal drilling reduced the available heat and lowered the local [[water table]] to the point that geyser activity could no longer be sustained.<ref name=\"uweb\" />\n\nMany of New Zealand\u2019s geysers have been destroyed by humans in the last century.

These geysers differ not only in their style of eruption but also in the cause that makes them erupt.\n\n=== Artificial geysers ===\n\nIn a number of places where there is geothermal activity, wells have been drilled and fitted with impermeable casements that allow them to erupt like geysers. The vents of such geysers are artificial, but are tapped into natural hydrothermal systems. These so-called ''artificial geysers'', technically known as ''erupting geothermal wells'', are not true geysers. Little Old Faithful Geyser, in [[Calistoga, California]], is an example. The geyser erupts from the casing of a well drilled in the late 19th century. According to Dr. John Rinehart in his book ''A Guide to Geyser Gazing'' (1976 p.&nbsp;49), a man had drilled into the geyser in search for water. He had \"simply opened up a dead geyser\".<ref>Jones, Wyoming [http://www.wyojones.com/of_califonia.htm \"Old Faithful Geyser of California\"] ''WyoJones' Geyser Pages'' Retrieved on 2008-03-31</ref>\n\n=== Perpetual spouter ===\n\nThis is a natural hot spring that spouts water constantly without stopping for recharge.

Many geothermal reserves are found all around the world. The geyser fields in Iceland are some of the most commercially viable geyser locations in the world. Since the 1920s hot water directed from the geysers has been used to heat greenhouses and to grow food that otherwise could not have been cultivated in Iceland's inhospitable climate. Steam and hot water from the geysers has also been used for heating homes since 1943 in Iceland. In 1979 the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) actively promoted development of geothermal energy in the \"Geysers-Calistoga Known Geothermal Resource Area\" (KGRA) near [[Calistoga, California]] through a variety of research programs and the Geothermal Loan Guarantee Program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/biblio/6817678 |title=Geothermal energy and the land resource: conflicts and constraints in The Geysers-Calistoga KGRA |publisher=DOE\u2013SciTech |date=14 July 1980 |accessdate=October 2015}}</ref> The Department is obligated by law to assess the potential environmental impacts of geothermal development.<ref>Kerry O\u2019Banion and Charles Hall [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6817678-VCD58M/6817678.PDF Geothermal energy and the land resource: conflicts and constraints in The Geysers- Calistoga KGRA] osti.gov Retrieved on 2008-04-12</ref>\n\n== Cryogeysers ==\n{{further|Cryovolcano}}\n\nThere are several bodies in the [[Solar System]] where jet-like eruptions, often termed '''cryogeysers''' (''cryo'' meaning \"icy cold\"), have been observed or are believed to occur.

It is usually understood as a sequence of operations performed on the corresponding [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] of coefficients. This method can also be used to find the [[Rank (linear algebra)|rank]] of a matrix, to calculate the [[determinant]] of a matrix, and to calculate the inverse of an [[invertible matrix|invertible square matrix]]. The method is named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855), although it was known to Chinese mathematicians as early as 179&nbsp;CE (see [[#History|History section]]).\n\nTo perform row reduction on a matrix, one uses a sequence of [[elementary row operations]] to modify the matrix until the lower left-hand corner of the matrix is filled with zeros, as much as possible. There are three types of elementary row operations: \n* Swapping two rows, \n* Multiplying a row by a nonzero number, \n* Adding a multiple of one row to another row.\nUsing these operations, a matrix can always be transformed into an [[Triangular matrix|upper triangular matrix]], and in fact one that is in [[row echelon form]]. Once all of the leading coefficients (the leftmost nonzero entry in each row) are 1, and every column containing a leading coefficient has zeros elsewhere, the matrix is said to be in [[reduced row echelon form]]. This final form is unique; in other words, it is independent of the sequence of row operations used. For example, in the following sequence of row operations (where multiple elementary operations might be done at each step), the third and fourth matrices are the ones in row echelon form, and the final matrix is the unique reduced row echelon form.\n\n:<math>\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n1 & 1 & -1 & 1 \\\\\n3 & 11 & 5 & 35\n\\end{array}\\right]\\to\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -2 & -8 \\\\\n0 & 2 & 2 & 8\n\\end{array}\\right]\\to\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 3 & 1 & 9 \\\\\n0 & -2 & -2 & -8 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\\to\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr|r}\n1 & 0 & -2 & -3 \\\\\n0 & 1 & 1 & 4 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{array}\\right] </math>\n\nUsing row operations to convert a matrix into reduced row echelon form is sometimes called '''Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination'''. Some authors use the term Gaussian elimination to refer to the process until it has reached its upper triangular, or (unreduced) row echelon form. For computational reasons, when solving systems of linear equations, it is sometimes preferable to stop row operations before the matrix is completely reduced.\n\n== Definitions and example of algorithm ==\nThe process of row reduction makes use of [[elementary row operations]], and can be divided into two parts. The first part (sometimes called forward elimination) reduces a given system to ''row echelon form'', from which one can tell whether there are no solutions, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. The second part (sometimes called [[Triangular matrix#Forward and back substitution|back substitution]]) continues to use row operations until the solution is found; in other words, it puts the matrix into ''reduced'' row echelon form.\n\nAnother point of view, which turns out to be very useful to analyze the algorithm, is that row reduction produces a [[matrix decomposition]] of the original matrix. The elementary row operations may be viewed as the multiplication on the left of the original matrix by [[elementary matrix|elementary matrices]]. Alternatively, a sequence of elementary operations that reduces a single row may be viewed as multiplication by a [[Frobenius matrix]]. Then the first part of the algorithm computes an [[LU decomposition]], while the second part writes the original matrix as the product of a uniquely determined invertible matrix and a uniquely determined reduced row echelon matrix.\n\n===Row operations===\n{{see also|Elementary matrix}}\n\nThere are three types of '''elementary row operations''' which may be performed on the rows of a matrix:\n# Swap the positions of two rows.\n# Multiply a row by a non-zero [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]].\n# Add to one row a scalar multiple of another.\n\nIf the matrix is associated to a system of linear equations, then these operations do not change the solution set. Therefore, if one's goal is to solve a system of linear equations, then using these row operations could make the problem easier.\n\n===Echelon form===\n{{main|Row echelon form}}\nFor each row in a matrix, if the row does not consist of only zeros, then the leftmost nonzero entry is called the ''[[leading coefficient]]'' (or ''pivot'') of that row. So if two leading coefficients are in the same column, then a row operation of [[#Row operations|type 3]] could be used to make one of those coefficients zero. Then by using the row swapping operation, one can always order the rows so that for every non-zero row, the leading coefficient is to the right of the leading coefficient of the row above. If this is the case, then matrix is said to be in '''row echelon form'''. So the lower left part of the matrix contains only zeros, and all of the zero rows are below the non-zero rows. The word \"echelon\" is used here because one can roughly think of the rows being ranked by their size, with the largest being at the top and the smallest being at the bottom.\n\nFor example, the following matrix is in row echelon form, and its leading coefficients are shown in red.\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n  0 & \\color{red}{\\mathbf{2}} &                       1 & -1 \\\\\n  0 &                       0 & \\color{red}{\\mathbf{3}} &  1 \\\\\n  0 &                       0 &                       0 &  0\n\\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nIt is in echelon form because the zero row is at the bottom, and the leading coefficient of the second row (in the third column), is to the right of the leading coefficient of the first row (in the second column).\n\nA matrix is said to be in '''reduced row echelon form''' if furthermore all of the leading coefficients are equal to 1 (which can be achieved by using the elementary row operation of type 2), and in every column containing a leading coefficient, all of the other entries in that column are zero (which can be achieved by using elementary row operations of type 3).\n\n===Example of the algorithm===\nSuppose the goal is to find and describe the set of solutions to the following [[system of linear equations]]:\n:<math>\\begin{alignat}{7}\n2x &&\\; + \\;&& y             &&\\; - \\;&& z  &&\\; = \\;&& 8 & \\qquad (L_1) \\\\\n-3x &&\\; - \\;&& y             &&\\; + \\;&& 2z &&\\; = \\;&& -11 & \\qquad (L_2) \\\\\n-2x &&\\; + \\;&& y &&\\; +\\;&& 2z  &&\\; = \\;&& -3 &  \\qquad (L_3)\n\\end{alignat}</math>\n\nThe table below is the row reduction process applied simultaneously to the system of equations, and its associated [[augmented matrix]]. In practice, one does not usually deal with the systems in terms of equations but instead makes use of the augmented matrix, which is more suitable for computer manipulations. The row reduction procedure may be summarized as follows: eliminate {{mvar|x}} from all equations below {{math|''L''<sub>1</sub>}}, and then eliminate {{mvar|y}} from all equations below {{math|''L''<sub>2</sub>}}. This will put the system into [[triangular form]]. Then, using back-substitution, each unknown can be solved for.\n\n:{| style=\"width: 700px\" style=\"background-color:white;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!System of equations !! Row operations !!

So for the first step, the {{mvar|x}} is eliminated from {{math|''L''<sub>2</sub>}} by adding {{math|{{sfrac|3|2}}''L''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''L''<sub>2</sub>}}. Next {{mvar|x}} is eliminated from {{math|''L''<sub>3</sub>}} by adding {{math|''L''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''L''<sub>3</sub>}}. These row operations are labelled in the table as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nL_2 + \\tfrac32L_1 &\\rightarrow L_2 \\\\[5px]\nL_3 + L_1 &\\rightarrow L_3.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nOnce {{mvar|y}} is also eliminated from the third row, the result is a system of linear equations in triangular form, and so the first part of the algorithm is complete. From a computational point of view, it is faster to solve the variables in reverse order, a process known as back-substitution. One sees the solution is {{math|''z'' {{=}} \u22121}}, {{math|''y'' {{=}} 3}}, and {{math|''x'' {{=}} 2}}. So there is a unique solution to the original system of equations.\n\nInstead of stopping once the matrix is in echelon form, one could continue until the matrix is in ''reduced'' row echelon form, as it is done in the table. The process of row reducing until the matrix is reduced is sometimes referred to as '''Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination''', to distinguish it from stopping after reaching echelon form.\n\n== History ==\nThe method of Gaussian elimination appears in the Chinese mathematical text [[Rod calculus#System of linear equations|Chapter Eight: ''Rectangular Arrays'']] of ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''. Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. The first reference to the book by this title is dated to 179&nbsp;CE, but parts of it were written as early as approximately 150&nbsp;BCE.<ref>{{harvtxt|Calinger|1999}}, pp. 234\u2013236</ref><ref name=\"princeton\">{{cite book|author1=Timothy Gowers|author2=June Barrow-Green|author3=Imre Leader|title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics|date=8 September 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2|page=607}}<!-- |accessdate=28 September 2012 --></ref> It was commented on by [[Liu Hui]] in the 3rd century.\n\nThe method in Europe stems from the notes of [[Isaac Newton]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Grcar|2011a}}, pp. 169-172</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Grcar|2011b}}, pp. 783-785</ref> In 1670, he wrote that all the algebra books known to him lacked a lesson for solving simultaneous equations, which Newton then supplied.  Cambridge University eventually published the notes as ''Arithmetica Universalis'' in 1707 long after Newton had left academic life.  The notes were widely imitated, which made (what is now called) Gaussian elimination a standard lesson in algebra textbooks by the end of the 18th century.  [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] in 1810 devised a notation for symmetric elimination that was adopted in the 19th century by professional [[Human computer|hand computers]] to solve the normal equations of least-squares problems.<ref>{{harvtxt|Lauritzen|}}, p.&nbsp;3</ref>  The algorithm that is taught in high school was named for Gauss only in the 1950s as a result of confusion over the history of the subject.<ref>{{harvtxt|Grcar|2011b}}, p.&nbsp;789</ref>\n\nSome authors use the term ''Gaussian elimination'' to refer only to the procedure until the matrix is in echelon form, and use the term '''Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination''' to refer to the procedure which ends in reduced echelon form. The name is used because it is a variation of Gaussian elimination as described by [[Wilhelm Jordan (geodesist)|Wilhelm Jordan]] in 1888. However, the method also appears in an article by Clasen published in the same year. Jordan and Clasen probably discovered Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination independently.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Althoen | first1=Steven C. | last2=McLaughlin | first2=Renate | title=Gauss\u2013Jordan reduction: a brief history | doi=10.2307/2322413 | year=1987 | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly|The American Mathematical Monthly]] | issn=0002-9890 | volume=94 | issue=2 | pages=130\u2013142 | jstor=2322413 | publisher=Mathematical Association of America}}</ref>\n\n== Applications ==\nThe historically first application of the row reduction method is for solving [[systems of linear equations]]. Here are some other important applications of the algorithm.\n\n=== Computing determinants ===\nTo explain how Gaussian elimination allows the computation of the determinant of a square matrix, we have to recall how the elementary row operations change the determinant:\n* Swapping two rows multiplies the determinant by \u22121\n* Multiplying a row by a nonzero scalar multiplies the determinant by the same scalar\n* Adding to one row a scalar multiple of another does not change the determinant.\n\nIf Gaussian elimination applied to a square matrix {{mvar|A}} produces a row echelon matrix {{mvar|B}}, let {{mvar|d}} be the product of the scalars by which the determinant has been multiplied, using the above rules. Then the determinant of {{mvar|A}} is the quotient by {{mvar|d}} of the product of the elements of the diagonal of {{mvar|B}}:\n:<math>\\det(A) = \\frac{\\prod\\operatorname{diag}(B)}{d}.</math>\n\nComputationally, for an {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix, this method needs only {{math|[[O notation|O(''n''<sup>3</sup>)]]}} arithmetic operations, while solving by elementary methods requires {{math|O(2<sup>''n''</sup>)}} or {{math|O(''n''!)}} operations. Even on the fastest computers, the elementary methods are impractical for {{math|''n''}} above 20.\n\n=== Finding the inverse of a matrix ===\n{{see also|Invertible matrix}}\nA variant of Gaussian elimination called Gauss\u2013Jordan elimination can be used for finding the inverse of a matrix, if it exists.  If {{math|''A''}} is an {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} square matrix, then one can use row reduction to compute its [[invertible matrix|inverse matrix]], if it exists. First, the {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} [[identity matrix]] is augmented to the right of {{math|''A''}}, forming an {{math|''n'' \u00d7 2''n''}} [[block matrix]] {{math|[''A'' {{!}} ''I'']}}. Now through application of elementary row operations, find the reduced echelon form of this {{math|''n'' \u00d7 2''n''}} matrix. The matrix {{math|''A''}} is invertible if and only if the left block can be reduced to the identity matrix {{math|''I''}}; in this case the right block of the final matrix is {{math|''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}. If the algorithm is unable to reduce the left block to {{math|''I''}}, then {{math|''A''}} is not invertible.\n\nFor example, consider the following matrix\n\n:<math> A =\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 & -1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 \\\\\n0 & -1 & 2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n</math>\n\nTo find the inverse of this matrix, one takes the following matrix augmented by the identity, and row reduces it as a 3&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;6 matrix:\n:<math> [ A | I ] = \n\\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr|rrr}\n2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\\n-1 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n0 & -1 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 1\n\\end{array} \\right].\n</math>\n\nBy performing row operations, one can check that the reduced row echelon form of this augmented matrix is:\n\n:<math> [ I | B ] = \n\\left[ \\begin{array}{rrr|rrr}\n1 & 0 & 0 & \\frac34 & \\frac12 & \\frac14\\\\[3pt]\n0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac12 & 1 & \\frac12\\\\[3pt]\n0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac14 & \\frac12 & \\frac34\n\\end{array} \\right].\n</math>\n\nOne can think of each row operation as the left product by an [[elementary matrix]]. Denoting by {{math|''B''}} the product of these elementary matrices, we showed, on the left, that {{math|''BA'' {{=}} ''I''}}, and therefore, {{math|''B'' {{=}} ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}. On the right, we kept a record of {{math|''BI'' {{=}} ''B''}}, which we know is the inverse desired. This procedure for finding the inverse works for square matrices of any size.\n\n=== Computing ranks and bases ===\nThe Gaussian elimination algorithm can be applied to any {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix {{mvar|A}}. In this way, for example, some 6&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;9 matrices can be transformed to a matrix that has a row echelon form like\n:<math> T=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na & * & * & *& * & * & * & * & * \\\\\n0 & 0 & b & * & * & * & * & * & * \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & c & * & * & * & * & * \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & d & * & * \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & e \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\n\\end{bmatrix}\n</math>\n\nwhere the stars are arbitrary entries and {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e''}} are nonzero entries. This echelon matrix {{mvar|T}} contains a wealth of information about {{mvar|A}}: the [[rank of a matrix|rank]] of {{mvar|A}} is 5 since there are 5 nonzero rows in {{mvar|T}}; the [[vector space]] spanned by the columns of {{mvar|A}} has a basis consisting of the first, third, fourth, seventh and ninth column of {{mvar|A}} (the columns of {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c'', ''d'', ''e''}} in {{mvar|T}}), and the stars show how the other columns of {{mvar|A}} can be written as linear combinations of the basis columns. This is a consequence of the distributivity of the [[dot product]] in the expression of a linear map [[Linear map#Matrices|as a matrix]].\n\nAll of this applies also to the reduced row echelon form, which is a particular row echelon format.\n\n== Computational efficiency ==\nThe number of arithmetic operations required to perform row reduction is one way of measuring the algorithm's computational efficiency. For example, to solve a system of {{math|''n''}} equations for {{math|''n''}} unknowns by performing row operations on the matrix until it is in echelon form, and then solving for each unknown in reverse order, requires {{math|{{sfrac|''n''(''n'' + 1)|2}}}} divisions, {{math|{{sfrac|2''n''<sup>3</sup> + 3''n''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 5''n''|6}}}} multiplications, and {{math|{{sfrac|2''n''<sup>3</sup> + 3''n''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 5''n''|6}}}} subtractions,<ref>{{harvtxt|Farebrother|1988}}, p. 12</ref> for a total of approximately {{math|{{sfrac|2''n''<sup>3</sup>|3}}}} operations. Thus it has [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|arithmetic]] complexity of {{math|O(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}}; see [[Big O notation]]. This arithmetic complexity is a good measure of the time needed for the whole computation when the time for each arithmetic operation is approximately constant. This is the case when the coefficients are represented by [[floating-point number]]s or when they belong to a [[finite field]]. If the coefficients are [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s exactly represented, the intermediate entries can grow exponentially large, so the [[bit complexity]] is exponential.<ref>{{Cite conference\n  | first1 = Xin Gui\n  | last1 = Fang\n  | first2 = George\n  | last2 = Havas\n  | title = On the worst-case complexity of integer Gaussian elimination\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the 1997 international symposium on Symbolic and algebraic computation\n  | conference = ISSAC '97\n  | pages = 28\u201331\n  | publisher = ACM\n  | year = 1997\n  | location = Kihei, Maui, Hawaii, United States\n  | url = http://itee.uq.edu.au/~havas/fh97.pdf\n  | doi = 10.1145/258726.258740\n  | isbn = 0-89791-875-4}}</ref>\nHowever, there is a variant of Gaussian elimination, called [[Bareiss algorithm]] that avoids this exponential growth of the intermediate entries, and, with the same arithmetic complexity of {{math|O(''n''<sup>3</sup>)}}, has a bit complexity of {{math|O(''n''<sup>5</sup>)}}.\n\nThis algorithm can be used on a computer for systems with thousands of equations and unknowns. However, the cost becomes prohibitive for systems with millions of equations. These large systems are generally solved using [[iterative method]]s. Specific methods exist for systems whose coefficients follow a regular pattern (see [[system of linear equations]]).\n\nTo put an {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix into reduced echelon form by row operations, one needs {{math|''n''<sup>3</sup>}} arithmetic operations, which is approximately 50% more computation steps.<ref>J. B. Fraleigh and R. A. Beauregard, Linear Algebra. Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 1995, Chapter 10.</ref>\n\nOne possible problem is [[numerical stability|numerical instability]], caused by the possibility of dividing by very small numbers. If, for example, the leading coefficient of one of the rows is very close to zero, then to row-reduce the matrix one would need to divide by that number so the leading coefficient is 1. This means that any error existed for the number which was close to zero would be amplified. Gaussian elimination is numerically stable for [[diagonally dominant]] or [[Positive-definite matrix|positive-definite]] matrices. For general matrices, Gaussian elimination is usually considered to be stable, when using [[Pivot element#Partial and complete pivoting|partial pivoting]], even though there are examples of stable matrices for which it is unstable.<ref>{{harvtxt|Golub|Van Loan|1996}}, \u00a73.4.6.</ref>\n\n=== Generalizations ===\n\nThe Gaussian elimination can be performed over any [[field (mathematics)|field]], not just the real numbers.\n\nGaussian elimination does not generalize in any way to higher-order [[tensors]] (matrices are [[Array data structure|array]] representations of order-2 tensors); even computing the rank of a tensor of order greater than 2 is [[NP-hard]].<ref>{{cite arXiv |last1=Hillar |first1=Christopher |last2=Lim |first2=Lek-Heng |date=2009-11-07 |eprint=0911.1393 |title=Most tensor problems are NP-hard |class=cs.CC}}</ref>\n\n== Pseudocode ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\nAs explained above, Gaussian elimination transforms a given {{math|''m'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrix {{mvar|A}} into a matrix in [[row-echelon form]].\n\nIn the following [[pseudocode]], <code>A[i, j]</code> denotes the entry of the matrix {{mvar|A}} in row {{mvar|i}} and column {{mvar|j}} with the indices starting from&nbsp;1. The transformation is performed ''in place'', meaning that the original matrix is lost for being eventually replaced by its row-echelon form.\n\n  h := 1 /* ''Initialization of the pivot row'' */\n  k := 1 /* ''Initialization of the pivot column'' */\n  '''while''' h \u2264 m '''and''' k \u2264 n\n    /* ''Find the k-th pivot:'' */\n    i_max := [[argmax]] (i = h ... m, abs(A[i, k]))\n    '''if''' A[i_max, k] = 0\n      /* ''No pivot in this column, pass to next column'' */\n      k := k+1\n    '''else'''\n       '''swap rows'''(h, i_max)\n       /* ''Do for all rows below pivot:'' */\n       '''for''' i = h + 1 ... m:\n          f := A[i, k] / A[h, k]\n          /* ''Fill with zeros the lower part of pivot column:'' */\n          A[i, k]  := 0\n          /* ''Do for all remaining elements in current row:'' */\n          '''for''' j = k + 1 ... n:\n             A[i, j] := A[i, j] - A[h, j] * f\n       /* ''Increase pivot row and column'' */\n       h := h+1 \n       k := k+1\n\nThis algorithm differs slightly from the one discussed earlier, by choosing a pivot with largest [[absolute value]]. Such a ''partial pivoting'' may be required if, at the pivot place, the entry of the matrix is zero. In any case, choosing the largest possible absolute value of the pivot improves the [[numerical stability]] of the algorithm, when [[floating point]] is used for representing numbers.\n\nUpon completion of this procedure the matrix will be in [[row echelon form]] and the corresponding system may be solved by back substitution.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fangcheng (mathematics)]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references/>\n\n== References ==\n* {{Citation | last1=Atkinson | first1=Kendall A. | title=An Introduction to Numerical Analysis | publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] | location=New York | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0471624899| year=1989}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Bolch | first1=Gunter | last2=Greiner | first2=Stefan | last3=de Meer | first3=Hermann | last4=Trivedi | first4=Kishor S. | title=Queueing Networks and Markov Chains: Modeling and Performance Evaluation with Computer Science Applications | publisher=[[Wiley-Interscience]] | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-471-79156-0 | year=2006}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Calinger | first1=Ronald | title=A Contextual History of Mathematics | publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] | isbn=978-0-02-318285-3 | year=1999}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Farebrother | first1=R.W. | title=Linear Least Squares Computations | publisher=Marcel Dekker | series=STATISTICS: Textbooks and Monographs | isbn=978-0-8247-7661-9 | year=1988}}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Lauritzen | first1=Niels | title=Undergraduate Convexity: From Fourier and Motzkin to Kuhn and Tucker  }}.\n* {{Citation | last1=Golub | first1=Gene H. | author1-link=Gene H.

Guant\u00e1namo Bay physically divides the Naval Station into sections. The bay extends past the boundaries of the base into Cuba, where the bay is then referred to as Bah\u00eda de Guant\u00e1namo. Guant\u00e1namo Bay contains several [[cay]]s, which are identified as Hospital Cay, Medico Cay, North Toro Cay, and South Toro Cay.\n\nLeeward Point of the Naval Station is the site of the active airfield. Major geographical features on Leeward Point include Mohomilla Bay and the Guant\u00e1namo River. Three beaches exist on the Leeward side. Two are available for use by base residents, while the third, Hicacal Beach, is closed.\n\nWindward Point contains most of the activities on the Naval Station. There are nine beaches available to base personnel. The highest point on the base is John Paul Jones hill at a total of 495 feet.<ref name=\"GLOSECGTMO\" /> The geography of Windward Point is such that there are many coves and peninsulas along the bay shoreline providing ideal areas for mooring ships.\n\n== Cactus Curtain ==\n[[File:Marines stack mines for disposal.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines stack up landmines for [[Demining#Removal methods|disposal]] in July 1997.]]\n\n\"Cactus Curtain\" is a term describing the line separating the naval base from Cuban-controlled territory. After the [[Cuban Revolution]], some Cubans sought refuge on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. In the fall of 1961, Cuban troops planted an {{convert|8|mi|km|adj=on}} barrier of ''[[Opuntia]]'' cactus along the northeastern section of the {{convert|17|mi|adj=on}} fence surrounding the base to stop Cubans from escaping Cuba to take refuge in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |title=Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Ecological Crises |work=Trade and Environment Database |publisher=[[American University]] |access-date=2009-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327053019/http://www.american.edu/TED/guantan.htm |archivedate=27 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This was dubbed the ''Cactus Curtain'', an allusion to Europe's [[Iron Curtain]],<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,940656,00.html |title=Yankees Besieged |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=16 March 1962}}</ref> the [[Bamboo Curtain]] in East Asia or the similar [[Bering Strait#The \"Ice Curtain\" border|Ice Curtain]] in the [[Bering Strait]].\n\nU.S. and Cuban troops placed some 55,000 [[land mine]]s across the \"[[no man's land]]\" around the perimeter of the naval base creating the second-largest minefield in the world, and the largest in the Western Hemisphere.

In the early 1990s, it held refugees who fled Haiti after military forces overthrew president [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]]. These refugees were held in a detainment area called [[Camp Bulkeley]] until [[United States district court]] Judge [[Sterling Johnson, Jr.]] declared the camp unconstitutional on 8 June 1993. This decision was later [[Vacated judgment|vacated]]. The last Haitian migrants departed Guantanamo on 1 November 1995.\n\nBeginning in 2002, some months after the [[War on Terror]] started in response to the [[attacks of September 11, 2001]], a small portion of the base was used to detain several hundred [[enemy combatants]] at [[Camp Delta (Guantanamo Bay)|Camp Delta]], [[Camp Echo (Guantanamo Bay)|Camp Echo]], [[Camp Iguana (Guantanamo Bay)|Camp Iguana]], and the now-closed [[Camp X-Ray (Guantanamo)|Camp X-Ray]]. The U.S. military has alleged without formal charge that some of these detainees are linked to [[al-Qaeda]] or the [[Taliban]]. In litigation regarding the availability of [[fundamental rights]] to those imprisoned at the base, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has recognized that the detainees \"have been imprisoned in territory over which the United States exercises exclusive jurisdiction and control.\"<ref>''Rasul v. Bush'', 542 U.S. 466 (2004).</ref> Therefore, the detainees have the fundamental right to [[due process of law]] under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]].

Bush]] announced that alleged or non-alleged combatants held by the CIA would be transferred to the custody of Department of Defense, and held at Guantanamo Prison. Of approximately 500 prisoners in Guantanamo Bay, only 10 have been [[military tribunal|tried]] by the [[Guantanamo military commission]], but all cases have been stayed pending the adjustments being made to comply with the U.S. Supreme Court decision in ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]''.\n\nPresident [[Barack Obama]] said he intended to close the detention camp, and planned to bring detainees to the United States to stand trial by the end of his first term in office. On 22 January 2009, he issued three [[executive order]]s. Only one of these explicitly dealt with policy at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and directed the camp's closure within one year. All three could have possibly impacted the detention center, as well as how the United States holds detainees.\n\nWhile mandating closure of the detention camp, the naval base as a whole is not subject to the order and will remain operational indefinitely. This plan was thwarted for the time being on 20 May 2009, when the [[United States Senate]] voted to keep the prison at Guantanamo Bay open for the foreseeable future and forbid the transfer of any detainees to facilities in the United States. Senator [[Daniel Inouye]], a Democrat from Hawaii and chairman of the appropriations committee, said he initially favored keeping Guantanamo open until Obama produced a \"coherent plan for closing the prison.\"<ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite news| title=Senate Nixes Obama's Guantanamo Plan| url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2009/05/20/obama-guantanamo.html| publisher=CBC News| date=20 May 2009| access-date=2011-10-20}}</ref> <!-- Note: changes to the detainee count should be made to Template:RemainingAtGuantanamo, and not here -->{{RemainingAtGuantanamo}}\n\n== Represented businesses ==\n[[File:The McDonalds at Guantanamo.jpg|thumb|McDonald's at Guantanamo]]\n\nA [[Baskin-Robbins]] ice cream store, which opened in the 1980s, was the first [[business franchise]] on the base.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} In 1986, Guantanamo became host to the first and only [[McDonald's]] restaurant within Cuba.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military/july-dec03/gbay_10-14.html| title=INSIDE GUANTANAMO| publisher=Online NewsHour|date=14 October 2003| first=Margaret| last=Warner| access-date=2006-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.jtfgtmo.southcom.mil/wire/wire/WirePDF/v2/TheWire-v2-i23-15Nov02.pdf| title=Profession of the Week: McDonald's workers| date=15 November 2002| author=Joseph A.
