It was created by the [[Treaty of Rome]] of 1957.<ref>Today the largely rewritten treaty continues in force as the ''Treaty on the functioning of the European Union'', as renamed by the Lisbon Treaty.</ref> Upon the formation of the [[European Union]] (EU) in 1993, the EEC was incorporated and renamed as the '''European Community''' ('''EC'''). In 2009 the EC's institutions were absorbed into the EU's wider framework and the community ceased to exist.\n\nThe Community's initial aim was to bring about economic integration, including a [[common market]] and [[customs union]], among its [[Inner Six|six founding members]]: [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[West Germany]]. It gained a common set of [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]] along with the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (EURATOM) as one of the [[European Communities]] under the 1965 [[Merger Treaty]] (Treaty of Brussels). In 1993, a complete [[single market]] was achieved, known as the [[internal market]], which allowed for the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within the EEC. In 1994, the internal market was formalised by the EEA agreement. This agreement also extended the internal market to include most of the member states of the [[European Free Trade Association]], forming the [[European Economic Area]] covering 15 countries.\n\nUpon the entry into force of the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in 1993, the EEC was renamed the ''European Community'' to reflect that it covered a wider range than economic policy. This was also when the three European Communities, including the EC, were collectively made to constitute the first of the [[three pillars of the European Union]], which the treaty also founded. The EC existed in this form until it was abolished by the 2009 [[Treaty of Lisbon]], which incorporated the EC's institutions into the EU's wider framework and provided that the EU would \"replace and succeed the European Community\".\n\nThe EEC was also known as the '''Common Market''' in the English-speaking countries and sometimes referred to as the '''European Community''' even before it was officially renamed as such in 1993.\n\n==History==\n{{Further|History of the European Union}}\n\n===Background===\nIn 1951, the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, creating the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC). This was an international community based on [[supranationalism]] and international law, designed to help the [[Economy of the European Union|economy of Europe]] and prevent future war by [[European integration|integrating]] its [[Member state of the European Union|members]].\n\nIn the aim of creating a [[federal Europe]] two further communities were proposed: a [[European Defence Community]] and a [[European Political Community]]. While the treaty for the latter was being drawn up by the [[European Parliament|Common Assembly]], the ECSC parliamentary chamber, the proposed defense community was rejected by the [[French Parliament]]. ECSC President [[Jean Monnet]], a leading figure behind the communities, resigned from the High Authority in protest and began work on alternative communities, based on economic integration rather than political integration.<ref>Raymond F. Mikesell, ''The Lessons of Benelux and the European Coal and Steel Community for the European Economic Community'', The American Economic Review, Vol. 48, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Seventieth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May 1958), pp. 428\u2013441</ref> After the [[Messina Conference]] in 1955, [[Paul Henri Spaak]] was given the task to prepare a report on the idea of a [[customs union]]. The so-called [[Spaak Report]] of the [[Spaak Committee]] formed the cornerstone of the intergovernmental negotiations at Val Duchesse conference centre in 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aei.pitt.edu/995/|title=Spaak report|publisher=}}</ref> Together with the [[Ohlin Report]] the Spaak Report would provide the basis for the [[Treaty of Rome]].\n\nIn 1956, [[Paul Henri Spaak]] led the [[Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom]] at the [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess|Val Duchesse]] conference centre, which prepared for the [[Treaty of Rome]] in 1957. The conference led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the [[Treaty of Rome]] establishing a European Economic Community.\n\n===Creation and early years===\nThe resulting communities were the European Economic Community (EEC) and the [[Euratom|European Atomic Energy Community]] (EURATOM or sometimes EAEC). These were markedly less supranational than the previous communities,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} due to protests from some countries that their [[sovereignty]] was being infringed (however there would still be concerns with the behaviour of the [[Hallstein Commission]]). The first formal meeting of the [[Hallstein Commission]] was held on 16 January 1958 at the [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess|Chateau de Val-Duchesse]]. The EEC (direct ancestor of the modern Community) was to create a [[customs union]] while Euratom would promote co-operation in the [[nuclear power]] sphere. The EEC rapidly became the most important of these and expanded its activities. One of the first important accomplishments of the EEC was the establishment (1962) of common price levels for agricultural products. In 1968, internal tariffs (tariffs on trade between member nations) were removed on certain products.\n\nAnother crisis was triggered in regard to proposals for the financing of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which came into force in 1962. The transitional period whereby decisions were made by unanimity had come to an end, and majority-voting in the Council had taken effect. Then-[[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s opposition to supranationalism and fear of the other members challenging the CAP led to an \"empty chair policy\" whereby French representatives were withdrawn from the European institutions until the French veto was reinstated. Eventually, a compromise was reached with the [[Luxembourg compromise]] on 29 January 1966 whereby a [[gentlemen's agreement]] permitted members to use a veto on areas of national interest.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6453889.stm Fifty years of fraternal rivalry] news.bbc.co.uk 19/03/07</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_empty_chair_policy-en-f6d19361-9a7a-4e39-ae93-0f898e652d85.html|title=The 'empty chair' policy|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 July 1967 when the [[Merger Treaty]] came into operation, combining the institutions of the ECSC and Euratom into that of the EEC, they already shared a [[European Parliament|Parliamentary Assembly]] and [[European Court of Justice|Courts]]. Collectively they were known as the ''[[European Communities]]''. The Communities still had independent personalities although were increasingly integrated. Future treaties granted the community new powers beyond simple economic matters which had achieved a high level of integration. As it got closer to the goal of political integration and a peaceful and united Europe, what [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] described as a ''[[Common European Home]]''.\n\n===Enlargement and elections===\n[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|[[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] vetoed British membership, held back the development of Parliament's powers and was at the centre of the 'empty chair crisis' of 1965]]\nThe 1960s saw the first attempts at [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]]. In 1961, [[Denmark]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Norway]] and the [[United Kingdom]] applied to join the three Communities. However, President Charles de Gaulle saw British membership as a [[Trojan horse]] for U.S. influence and vetoed membership, and the applications of all four countries were suspended. {{Citation needed|date = May 2016}} [[Greece]] became the first country to join the EC in 1961 as an associate member, however its membership was suspended in 1967 after the Colonels coup d'\u00e9tat.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Deschamps|first1=Etienne|last2=Lekl|first2=Christian|title=The accession of Greece|url=https://www.cvce.eu/content/publication/1999/1/1/61a2a7a5-39a9-4b06-91f8-69ae77b41515/publishable_en.pdf|website=CVCE|publisher=University of Luxemburg|accessdate=18 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nA year later, in February 1962, [[Spain]] attempted to join the European Communities. However, because [[Francoist Spain]] was not a democracy, all members rejected the request in 1964.\n\nThe four countries resubmitted their applications on 11 May 1967 and with [[Georges Pompidou]] succeeding Charles de Gaulle as French president in 1969, the veto was lifted. Negotiations began in 1970 under the pro-European government of [[Edward Heath]], who had to deal with disagreements relating to the [[Common Agricultural Policy]] and the UK's relationship with the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. Nevertheless, two years later the accession treaties were signed so that Denmark, Ireland and the UK [[Enlargement of the European Union#First enlargement|joined the Community]] effective 1 January 1973.

It had originated from then-[[French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (e.g. the Commission) over the integration process.

It came into force on 1 July 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_provisions_of_the_single_european_act-en-243555aa-d219-4525-9978-34325bb5e17a.html|title=The provisions of the Single European Act|publisher=}}</ref> The act was followed by work on what would be the [[Maastricht Treaty]], which was agreed on 10 December 1991, signed the following year and coming into force on 1 November 1993 establishing the European Union, and paving the way for the [[European Monetary Union]].\n\n===European Community===\n\nThe EU absorbed the European Communities as one of its [[three pillars of the European Union|three pillars]]. The EEC's areas of activities were enlarged and were renamed the ''European Community'', continuing to follow the [[supranational]] structure of the EEC. The EEC institutions became those of the EU, however the Court, Parliament and Commission had only limited input in the new pillars, as they worked on a more [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental]] system than the European Communities. This was reflected in the names of the institutions, the Council was formally the \"Council of the ''European Union''\" while the Commission was formally the \"Commission of the ''European Communities''\".\n\nHowever, after the Treaty of Maastricht, Parliament gained a much bigger role. Maastricht brought in the [[codecision procedure]], which gave it equal legislative power with the Council on Community matters. Hence, with the greater powers of the supranational institutions and the operation of [[Qualified Majority Voting]] in the Council, the Community pillar could be described as a far more [[Federalism|federal]] method of decision making.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Amsterdam]] transferred responsibility for free movement of persons (e.g., [[Visa (document)|visas]], [[illegal immigration]], [[Right of asylum|asylum]]) from the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) pillar to the European Community (JHA was renamed [[Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters]] (PJCC) as a result).<ref name=\"Folk\">[http://www.eu-oplysningen.dk/euo_en/spsv/all/12/ What are the three pillars of the EU?], Folketingets EU-Oplysning</ref> Both Amsterdam and the [[Treaty of Nice]] also extended [[codecision procedure]] to nearly all policy areas, giving Parliament equal power to the Council in the Community.\n\nIn 2002, the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]] which established the ECSC expired, having reached its 50-year limit (as the first treaty, it was the only one with a limit). No attempt was made to renew its mandate; instead, the [[Treaty of Nice]] transferred certain of its elements to the [[Treaty of Rome]] and hence its work continued as part of the EC area of the European Community's remit.\n\nAfter the entry into force of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2009 the pillar structure ceased to exist. The European Community, together with its [[legal person]]ality, was absorbed into the newly consolidated European Union which merged in the other two pillars (however Euratom remained distinct). This was originally proposed under the [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] but that treaty failed ratification in 2005.\n\n==Aims and achievements==\n{{Expand section|date=December 2007}}\nThe main aim of the EEC, as stated in its preamble, was to \"preserve peace and liberty and to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe\".

The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] is also composed of one national minister who represents their national government. Each state also has a right to one [[European Commissioner]] each, although in the [[European Commission]] they are not supposed to represent their national interest but that of the Community. Prior to 2004, the larger members (France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom) have had two Commissioners. In the [[European Parliament]], members are [[Apportionment in the European Parliament|allocated a set number seats]] related to their population, however these ([[European Parliament election, 1979|since 1979]]) have been directly elected and they sit according to political allegiance, not national origin. Most other institutions, including the [[European Court of Justice]], have some form of national division of its members.\n\n==Institutions==\n{{Further|Institutions of the European Union}}\nThere were three political institutions which held the executive and legislative power of the EEC, plus one judicial institution and a fifth body created in 1975. These institutions (except for the auditors) were created in 1957 by the EEC but from 1967 onwards they applied to all three Communities. The Council represents governments, the Parliament represents citizens and the Commission represents the European interest.<ref name=\"Europa Institutions Commission\">{{Cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Institutions: The European Commission |work= |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |doi= |accessdate=2007-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623104055/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/comm/index_en.htm |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> Essentially, the Council, Parliament or another party place a request for legislation to the Commission. The Commission then drafts this and presents it to the Council for approval and the Parliament for an opinion (in some cases it had a veto, depending upon the [[European Union legislative procedure|legislative procedure]] in use). The Commission's duty is to ensure it is implemented by dealing with the day-to-day running of the Union and taking others to Court if they fail to comply.<ref name=\"Europa Institutions Commission\"/> After the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, these institutions became those of the European Union, though limited in some areas due to the pillar structure. Despite this, Parliament in particular has gained more power over legislation and security of the Commission. The Court was the highest authority in the law, settling legal disputes in the Community, while the Auditors had no power but to investigate.\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Luxembourg0080.JPG|thumb|The High Authority had more executive powers than the Commission which replaced it]]\nThe EEC inherited some of the [[European Coal and Steel Community#Institutions|Institutions of the ECSC]] in that the [[European Parliament|Common Assembly]] and [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice]] of the ECSC had their authority extended to the EEC and Euratom in the same role. However the EEC, and Euratom, had different executive bodies to the ECSC. In place of the ECSC's Council of Ministers was the [[Council of the European Union|Council of the European Economic Community]], and in place of the [[High Authority of the European Coal and Steel Community|High Authority]] was the [[European Commission|Commission of the European Communities]].\n\nThere was greater difference between these than name: the French government of the day had grown suspicious of the supranational power of the High Authority and sought to curb its powers in favour of the intergovernmental style Council. Hence the Council had a greater executive role in the running of the EEC than was the situation in the ECSC. By virtue of the [[Merger Treaty]] in 1967, the executives of the ECSC and Euratom were merged with that of the EEC, creating a single institutional structure governing the three separate Communities. From here on, the term ''European Communities'' were used for the institutions (for example, from ''Commission of the European Economic Community'' to the ''Commission of the European Communities'').<ref name=\"ENA Merger\">{{Cite web|title = Merging of the executives|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/merging_the_executives-en-575850b6-f472-406a-936d-8c08a9e0db32.html|accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref><ref name=\"ENA Council\">{{Cite web|publisher = CVCE|title = Council of the European Union|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_council_of_the_european_union-en-de23700c-e50a-4e0e-a7de-80665e4caf9f.html|accessdate = 2013-04-26}}</ref><ref name=\"ENA Commission\">{{Cite web|title = European Commission|publisher=CVCE|url=http://www.cvce.eu/obj/european_commission-en-281a3c0c-839a-48fd-b69c-bc2588c780ec.html|accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref>\n\n===Council===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F078267-0023, Bonn, Ministerpr\u00e4sidenten mit EU-Kommissar Delors-CROPPED.jpg|thumb|[[President of the European Commission|President]] [[Jacques Delors]] the last EEC Commission President.]]\n\nThe [[Council of the European Union|Council of the European Communities]] was a body holding legislative and executive powers and was thus the main decision making body of the Community. Its [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|Presidency]] rotated between the [[European Union member state|member states]] every six months and it is related to the [[European Council]], which was an informal gathering of national leaders (started in 1961) on the same basis as the Council.<ref name=\"Europa Institutions Council\">{{Cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Institutions: The Council of the European Union|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703155822/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/council/index_en.htm|archivedate=3 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Council was composed of one national [[Minister (government)|minister]] from each member state. However the Council met in various forms depending upon the topic. For example, if agriculture was being discussed, the Council would be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represented their governments and were accountable to their national political systems. Votes were taken either by majority (with votes allocated according to population) or unanimity. In these various forms they share some legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament.<ref name=\"Europa Institutions Council\"/> Since the 1960s the Council also began to meet informally at the level of national leaders; these [[European Council|European summits]] followed the same presidency system and secretariat as the Council but was not a formal formation of it.\n\n===Commission===\nThe [[European Commission|Commission of the European Communities]] was the [[Executive (government)|executive arm]] of the community, drafting [[law of the European Union|Community law]], dealing with the day to running of the Community and upholding the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaties]]. It was designed to be independent, representing the Community interest, but was composed of national representatives (two from each of the larger states, one from the smaller states). One of its members was the [[President of the European Commission|President]], appointed by the Council, who chaired the body and represented it.\n\n===Parliament===\n[[File:Pleniere.JPG|thumb|The [[European Parliament]] held its first elections in 1979, slowly gaining more influence over Community decision making.]]\n\nUnder the Community, the [[European Parliament]] (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an advisory role to the Council and Commission. There were a number of [[European Union legislative procedure|Community legislative procedures]], at first there was only the [[consultation procedure]], which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The [[Single European Act]] gave Parliament more power, with the [[assent procedure]] giving it a right to veto proposals and the [[cooperation procedure]] giving it equal power with the Council if the Council was not unanimous.\n\nIn 1970 and 1975, the [[Budgetary treaties of the European Communities|Budgetary treaties]] gave Parliament power over the [[Budget of the European Union|Community budget]]. The Parliament's members, up-until 1980 were national MPs serving part-time in the Parliament. The Treaties of Rome had required elections to be held once the Council had decided on a voting system, but this did not happen and elections were delayed until 1979 (see [[European Parliament election, 1979]]). After that, Parliament was elected every five years. In the following 20 years, it gradually won co-decision powers with the Council over the adoption of legislation, the right to approve or reject the appointment of the Commission President and the Commission as a whole, and the right to approve or reject international agreements entered into by the Community.\n\n===Court===\nThe [[European Court of Justice|Court of Justice of the European Communities]] was the [[supreme court|highest court]] of on matters of [[Law of the European Union|Community law]] and was composed of one judge per state with a president elected from among them. Its role was to ensure that Community law was applied in the same way across all states and to settle legal disputes between institutions or states. It became a powerful institution as Community law overrides national law.\n\n===Auditors===\nThe fifth institution is the ''[[European Court of Auditors]]'', which despite its name had no judicial powers like the Court of Justice. Instead, it ensured that [[taxpayer]] funds from the [[budget of the European Union|Community budget]] have been correctly spent. The court provided an [[audit report]] for each financial year to the Council and Parliament and gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions. It is the only institution not mentioned in the original treaties, having been set up in 1975.<ref name=\"Europa Institutions Auditors\">{{Cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=Institutions: Court of Auditors|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|url=http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=2007-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222001147/http://europa.eu/institutions/inst/auditors/index_en.htm|archivedate=22 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Policy areas==\n{{Further|Three pillars of the European Union}}\nAt the time of its abolition, the European Community pillar covered the following areas;<ref name=\"Folk\"/>\n{|\n|-\n| valign=top |\n* [[Right of asylum|Asylum policy]]\n* [[Border control]]\n* [[Common Agricultural Policy]]\n* [[Common Fisheries Policy]]\n* [[European Community competition law|Competition]]\n* [[Consumer protection]]\n* [[Customs Union]] and [[Single market]]\n| valign=top |\n* [[Economic and monetary union]]\n* Education and Culture\n* Employment\n* [[Environmental law]]\n* [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU Citizenship]]\n* Healthcare\n| valign=top |\n* [[Border control#Immigration policy|Immigration policy]]\n* Research\n* [[Schengen treaty]]\n* [[Social policy]]\n* [[International trade|Trade policy]]\n* [[Trans-European Networks]]\n|}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Economy of the European Union]]\n* [[Brussels and the European Union]]\n* [[Delors Commission]]\n* [[European Commission]]\n* [[European Customs Information Portal (ECIP)]]\n* [[European Institutions in Strasbourg]]\n* [[History of the European Communities (1958-1972)]]\n* [[History of the European Communities (1973-1993)]]\n* [[Location of European Union institutions]]\n* [[Snake in the tunnel]]\n\n==EU evolution timeline==\n{{EU evolution timeline}}\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n===References===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n* [[Nicola Acocella|Acocella, Nicola]] (1992), \u2018''Trade and direct investment within the EC: The impact of strategic considerations''\u2019, in: Cantwell, John (ed.), \u2018''Multinational investment in modern Europe''\u2019, E.

The [[Stockholm Convention (1960)|Stockholm Convention]], to establish the EFTA, was signed on 4 January 1960 in the [[Sweden|Swedish]] capital by seven countries (known as the \"[[outer seven]]\").\n\nSince 1995, only two founding members remain, namely Norway and Switzerland. The other five, [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], [[Portugal]], [[Sweden]] and the [[United Kingdom]], have joined the EU in the intervening years. The initial Stockholm Convention was superseded by the [[Vaduz]] Convention, which aimed to provide a successful framework for continuing the expansion and [[free trade area|liberalization of trade]], both among the organization's member states and with the rest of the world.\n\nWhilst the EFTA is not a [[customs union]] and member states have full rights to enter into bilateral third-country trade arrangements, it does have a coordinated trade policy.<ref name=TradeRelations/> As a result, its member states have jointly concluded [[free trade agreements]] with the EU and a number of other countries.<ref name=TradeRelations/> To participate in the EU's single market, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway are parties to the Agreement on a [[European Economic Area]] (EEA), with compliances regulated by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] and the [[EFTA Court]]. Switzerland has a [[Switzerland\u2013European Union relations|set of bilateral agreements with the EU]] instead.\n\n==History==\nOn 12 January 1960, the Treaty on the European Free Trade Association was initiated in the [[Golden Hall (Stockholm City Hall)|Golden Hall]] of the Prince's Palace of [[Stockholm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/zh9hxdbmm2jc/european-free-trade-association/ |title=European Free Trade Association by Shobicka Mehanathan on Prezi |publisher=Prezi.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-08}}</ref> This established the progressive elimination of customs duties on industrial products, but did not affect agricultural or fisheries products.\n\nThe main difference between the early EEC and the EFTA was that the latter did not operate common external customs [[tariff]]s unlike the former: each EFTA member was free to establish its individual customs duties against, or its individual free trade agreements with, non-EFTA countries. Despite this modest initiative, the financial results were excellent as it stimulated an increase of foreign trade volume among{{clarify|between?|date=April 2017}} its members from  $US 3.5 billion to $US 8.2 billion between 1959 and 1967.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}<!-- citation needed to clarify if the trade increase was between members: if so then the opening sentence is irrelevant.

Portugal (1985), followed in 1995 by Austria, Finland, and Sweden, left to join the EU. Four members remained: [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]], [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Iceland]].\n\n===Portugal Fund===\nThe Portugal Fund was established in 1975 when Portugal was still a member of EFTA.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It was to provide funding for the development of Portugal after the [[Carnation Revolution]] and the consequential restoration of democracy and the decolonization of the country's overseas possessions. This followed a period of economic sanctions by most of the international community, which left Portugal economically underdeveloped compared to the rest of the [[western Europe]]. When Portugal left EFTA in 1985 in order join the EEC, the remaining EFTA members decided to continue the Portugal Fund so that Portugal would continue to benefit from it. The Fund originally took the form of a low-interest loan from the EFTA member states to the value of [[United States dollar|USD]] 100 million. Repayment was originally to commence in 1988, however, EFTA then decided to postpone the start of repayments until 1998. The Portugal Fund has now{{when|date=April 2017}} been dissolved.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n==Membership==\n===History===\n[[File:EFTA AELE countries and former members.svg|thumb|right|{{legend|#276d3a|EFTA member states}}{{legend|#b3d9b4|Former members, now EU member states}}{{legend|#808080|Rest of EU member states}}]]\n\n\nThe founding members of the EFTA were: [[Austria]], [[Denmark]], Norway, [[Portugal]], [[Sweden]], Switzerland, and the [[United Kingdom]].

Liechtenstein joined the EFTA in 1991 (previously its interests had been represented by Switzerland).

The remaining options, EEA membership and a FAA with the states, were found to be viable and were recommended by the Commission.

In addition, in connection with the EEA Agreement of 1992, two other EFTA organisations were established, the EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court.\n\n===Council===\nThe [[EFTA Council]] is the highest governing body of EFTA. The Council usually meets eight times a year at the ambassadorial level (heads of permanent delegations to EFTA) and twice a year at Ministerial level. In the Council meetings, the delegations consult with one another, negotiate and decide on policy issues regarding EFTA. Each Member State is represented and has one vote, though decisions are usually reached through consensus.\n\nThe Council discusses substantive matters, especially relating to the development of EFTA relations with third countries and the management of free trade agreements, and keeps under general review relations with the EU third-country policy and administration. It has a broad mandate to consider possible policies to promote the overall objectives of the Association and to facilitate the development of links with other states, unions of states or [[international organisations]]. The Council also manages relations between the EFTA States under the EFTA Convention. Questions relating to the [[European Economic Area|EEA]] are dealt with by the Standing Committee in Brussels.\n\n===Secretariat===\nThe day-to-day running of the Secretariat is headed by the Secretary-General, [[Kristinn F. \u00c1rnason]], who is assisted by two Deputy Secretaries-General, one based in [[Geneva]] and the other in [[Brussels]]. The three posts are shared between the Member States. The division of the Secretariat reflects the division of EFTA's activities. The Secretariat employs approximately 100 staff members, of whom a third are based in Geneva and two thirds in Brussels and [[Luxembourg City|Luxembourg]].\n\nThe Headquarters in Geneva deals with the management and negotiation of free trade agreements with non-EU countries, and provides support to the EFTA Council.\n\nIn Brussels, the Secretariat provides support for the management of the EEA Agreement and assists the Member States in the preparation of new legislation for integration into the EEA Agreement. The Secretariat also assists the Member States in the elaboration of input to EU decision making.\n\nThe two duty stations work together closely to implement the Vaduz Convention's stipulations on the intra-EFTA Free Trade Area.\n\nThe EFTA Statistical Office in Luxembourg contributes to the development of a broad and integrated European Statistical System. The EFTA Statistical Office (ESO) is located in the premises of [[Eurostat]], the Statistical Office of the European Union in Luxembourg, and functions as a liaison office between Eurostat and the EFTA National Statistical Institutes. ESO's main objective is to promote the full inclusion of the EFTA States in the European Statistical System, thus providing harmonised and comparable statistics to support the general cooperation process between EFTA and the EU within and outside the EEA Agreement. The cooperation also entails technical cooperation programmes with third countries and training of European statisticians.\n\n===EEA institutions===\nA Joint Committee consisting of the EEA States plus the European Commission (representing the EU) has the function of extending relevant [[European Union law|EU law]] to the non EU members. An EEA Council meets twice yearly to govern the overall relationship between the EEA members.\n\nRather than setting up pan-EEA institutions, the activities of the EEA are regulated by the [[EFTA Surveillance Authority]] and the [[EFTA Court]]. The EFTA Surveillance Authority and the EFTA Court regulate the activities of the EFTA members in respect of their obligations in the European Economic Area (EEA). Since Switzerland is not an EEA member, it does not participate in these institutions.\n\nThe EFTA Surveillance Authority performs a role for EFTA members that is equivalent to that of the European Commission for the EU, as \"guardian of the treaties\" and the EFTA Court performs the [[European Court of Justice]]-equivalent role.\n\nThe original plan for the EEA lacked the EFTA Court or the EFTA Surveillance Authority: the European Court of Justice and the European Commission were to exercise those roles. However, during the negotiations for the EEA agreement, the European Court of Justice informed the Council of the European Union by way of letter that it considered that it would be a violation of the treaties to give to the EU institutions these powers with respect to non-EU member states.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Therefore, the current arrangement was developed instead.\n\n===EEA and Norway Grants===\nThe [[EEA and Norway Grants]] are the financial contributions of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway to reduce social and economic disparities in Europe. They were established in conjunction with the 2004 enlargement of the European Economic Area (EEA), which brought together the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway in the Internal Market. In the period from 2004 to 2009, \u20ac1.3&nbsp;billion of project funding was made available for project funding in the 15 beneficiary states in Central and Southern Europe. The EEA and Norway Grants are administered by the Financial Mechanism Office, which is affiliated to the EFTA Secretariat in Brussels.\n\n===Locations===\nThe EFTA Secretariat is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, but also has duty stations in Brussels, [[Belgium]] and Luxembourg City, [[Luxembourg]]. The EFTA Surveillance Authority has its headquarters in Brussels, Belgium (the same location as the headquarters of the European Commission), while the EFTA Court has its headquarters in Luxembourg City (the same location as the headquarters of the European Court of Justice).\n\n==Relationship with the European Union==\n{{main article|European Economic Area}}\n{{see also|Accession of Iceland to the European Union|Liechtenstein\u2013European Union relations|Norway\u2013European Union relations|Switzerland\u2013European Union relations}}\n\nExcept for Switzerland, the EFTA members are also members of the European Economic Area (EEA). The EEA comprises three member states of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and 28 [[member states of the European Union]] (EU), including [[Croatia]] which is provisionally applying the agreement pending its ratification by all EEA countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.efta.int/eea/eea-agreement.aspx |title=EEA Agreement &#124; European Free Trade Association |publisher=Efta.int |date=1994-01-01 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref><ref name=croatsign>{{cite web|url=http://www.efta.int/eea/news/croatia-joins-eea-2750|title=Croatia joins the EEA|date=12 April 2014|accessdate=11 April 2014|publisher=European Free Trade Association}}</ref> It was established on 1 January 1994 following an agreement with the [[European Communities|European Community]] (which had become the EU two months earlier).<ref name=agreement>{{cite web|url=http://efta.int/~/media/Documents/legal-texts/eea/the-eea-agreement/Main%20Text%20of%20the%20Agreement/EEAagreement.ashx |title=AGREEMENT ON THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA |publisher=European Free Trade Association |date=2016-08-01 |accessdate=2017-05-08}}</ref> It allows the EFTA-EEA states to participate in the EU's Internal Market without being [[Member state of the European Union|members of the EU]]. They adopt almost all EU legislation related to the single market, except laws on agriculture and fisheries. However, they also contribute to and influence the formation of new EEA relevant policies and legislation at an early stage as part of a formal decision-shaping process. One EFTA member, Switzerland, has not joined the EEA but has a series of bilateral agreements, including a [[free trade agreement]], with the EU.\n\nThe following table summarises the various components of EU laws applied in the EFTA countries and their sovereign territories.

Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] before anything can become law.<ref>{{cite web|title = Fact Sheets 1.3.8 The Commission|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/factsheets/1_3_8_en.htm|accessdate =14 June 2007 }}</ref> The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law.<ref name=\"Kreppel\">{{cite book|first= Amie|last= Kreppel |editor1-first=Anand |editor1-last=Menon |editor2-first=Martin A. |editor2-last=Schain |title= Comparative Federalism:The European Union and the United States in Comparative Perspective: The European Union and the United States in Comparative Perspective|pages=245\u2013274|chapter= Understanding the European Parliament from a Federalist Perspective: The Legislatures of the USA and EU Compared|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2006}}</ref> Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president [[Hans-Gert P\u00f6ttering]] that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament does have a ''de facto'' right of legislative initiative.<ref name=\"Pot initiative\">{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=24 June 2008|title=P\u00f6ttering defends parliament's role at EU summits|publisher=The Parliament Magazine|url=http://www.theparliament.com/policy-focus/foreign-affairs/foreign-affairs-article/newsarticle/poettering-defends-parliaments-role-at-eu-summits/|accessdate=25 June 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524113601/http://www.theparliament.com/policy-focus/foreign-affairs/foreign-affairs-article/newsarticle/poettering-defends-parliaments-role-at-eu-summits/|archivedate=24 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Parliament also has a great deal of indirect influence, through [[European Union law#Legislation|non-binding resolutions]] and [[Committees of the European Parliament|committee hearings]], as a \"pan-European [[soapbox]]\" with the ear of [[Brussels and the European Union#Lobbyists and journalists|thousands of Brussels-based journalists]].

The procedure which has slowly become dominant is the \"[[ordinary legislative procedure]]\" (previously named \"codecision procedure\"), which provides an equal footing between Parliament and Council. In particular, under the procedure, the Commission presents a proposal to Parliament and the Council which can only become law if both agree on a text, which they do (or not) through successive readings up to a maximum of three. In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a \"common position\". That position may either be approved by Parliament,  or it may reject the text by an [[absolute majority]], causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a \"Conciliation Committee\" is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority.<ref name=\"Parliament's powers\">{{cite web|title = Parliament's powers and procedures|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/parliament/public/staticDisplay.do?language=EN&id=46|accessdate =12 June 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"decision making\">{{cite web|title=Decision-making in the European Union|work=|publisher=European Parliament|url=http://www.europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=18 September 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011040316/http://europa.eu/institutions/decision-making/index_en.htm|archivedate=11 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> This is also aided by Parliament's mandate as the only directly democratic institution, which has given it leeway to have greater control over legislation than other institutions, for example over its changes to the [[Bolkestein directive]] in 2006.<ref name=\"FT CIO\"/>\n\nThe few other areas that operate the ''special legislative procedures'' are justice & home affairs, budget and taxation and certain aspects of other policy areas: such as the fiscal aspects of environmental policy.

Previously this committee was considered by MEPs as a \"[[Cinderella]] committee\"; however, as it gained a new importance, it became more professional and rigorous, attracting increasing attention to its work.<ref name=\"Hoskyns\"/>\n\n[[File:Committee Room of the European Parliament in Brussels.jpg|thumb|left|A Committee room in the Parliament]]\nThe nature of the committees differ from their national counterparts as, although smaller in comparison to those of the [[United States Congressional committee|United States Congress]], the European Parliament's committees are unusually large by European standards with between eight and twelve dedicated members of staff and three to four support staff.

They do not express the view of the European Parliament. They serve a double purpose: to address a topic which is transversal to several committees and in a less formal manner. Their daily secretariat can be run either through the office of MEPs or through interest groups, be them corporate lobbies or NGOs. The favored access to MEPs which the organization running the secretariat enjoys can be one explanation to the multiplication of Intergroups in the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.cairn.info/revue-politique-europeenne-2003-1-page-123.htm Dutoit Laurent, \u00ab L'influence au sein du Parlement europ\u00e9en : les intergroupes \u00bb, Politique europ\u00e9enne 1/2003 (n\u00b0 9), p. 123-142].</ref> They are now strictly regulated and financial support, direct or otherwise (via Secretariat staff, for example) must be officially specified in a declaration of financial interests.<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/intergroupes/legislature_8/DecisionofCoPof16Dec1999-Rules_governing_the_establishment_of_integroupes.pdf Article 6, Rules governing the establishment of intergroups, decision of the Conference of Presidents, 16 december 1999 (last updated 11 September 2014)]</ref> Also Intergroups are established or renewed at the beginning of each legislature through a specific process. Indeed, the proposal for the constitution or renewal of an Intergroup must be supported by at least 3 political groups whose support is limited to a specific number of proposals in proportion to their size (for example, for the legislature 2014-2019, the EPP or S&D political groups could support 22 proposals whereas the Greens/EFA or the EFDD political groups only 7).<ref>[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/intergroupes/legislature_8/DecisionofCoPof16Dec1999-Rules_governing_the_establishment_of_integroupes.pdf Annex 1, Rules governing the establishment of intergroups, decision of the Conference of Presidents, 16 december 1999 (last updated 11 September 2014)]</ref>\n\n===Translation and interpretation===\nSpeakers in the European Parliament are entitled to speak in any of the 24 official [[languages of the European Union]], ranging from French and German to [[Maltese language|Maltese]] and Irish.

Due to the large number of languages, some being minor ones, since 1995 interpreting is sometimes done the opposite way, out of an interpreter's native tongue (the \"retour\" system). In addition, a speech in a minor language may be interpreted through a third language for lack of interpreters (\"relay\" interpreting)&nbsp;\u2014for example, when interpreting out of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] into [[Maltese language|Maltese]].<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/> Due to the complexity of the issues, interpretation is not word for word. Instead, interpreters have to convey the political meaning of a speech, regardless of their own views. This requires detailed understanding of the politics and terms of the Parliament, involving a great deal of preparation beforehand (e.g. reading the documents in question). Difficulty can often arise when MEPs use profanities, jokes and word play or speak too fast.<ref name=\"Interpreters\"/>\n\nWhile some see speaking their native language as an important part of their identity, and can speak more fluently in debates, interpretation and its cost has been criticised by some.

Before that, the first summits of EU heads of state or government were held in February and July 1961 (in [[Paris]] and [[Bonn]] respectively). They were informal summits of the leaders of the [[European Community]], and were started due to then-[[President of France|French President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]]'s resentment at the domination of supranational institutions (notably the [[European Commission]]) over the integration process, but petered out. The first influential summit held, after the departure of de Gaulle, was the [[The Hague|Hague]] summit of 1969, which reached an agreement on the admittance of the United Kingdom into the Community and initiated foreign policy cooperation (the [[European Political Cooperation]]) taking integration beyond economics.<ref name=\"seeToL\"/><ref name=\"Dragoman\">{{cite web|last=Stark |first=Christine |authorlink= |title=Evolution of the European Council: The implications of a permanent seat |work= |publisher=Dragoman.org |date= |url=http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf |format=PDF |doi= |accessdate=12 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709220601/http://www.dragoman.org/ec/belfast-2002.pdf |archivedate=9 July 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe summits were only formalised in the period between 1974 and 1988. At the December summit in Paris in 1974, following a proposal from then-French president [[Val\u00e9ry Giscard d'Estaing]], it was agreed that more high level, political input was needed following the \"empty chair crisis\" and economic problems.<ref>On the economic problems, see Imbrogno, Anthony (2016). \"The Founding of the European Council: economic reform and the mechanism of continuous negotiation\".

In 1987, it was included in the treaties for the first time (the [[Single European Act]]) and had a defined role for the first time in the [[Maastricht Treaty]]. At first only a minimum of two meetings per year were required, which resulted in an average of three meetings per year being held for the 1975-1995 period. Since 1996, the number of meetings were required to be minimum four per year. For the latest 2008-2014 period, this minimum was well exceeded, by an average of seven meetings being held per year. The [[#Seat|seat of the Council]] was formalised in 2002, basing it in Brussels. Three types of European Councils exist: Informal, Scheduled and Extraordinary. While the informal meetings are also scheduled 1\u00bd years in advance, they differ from the scheduled ordinary meetings by not ending with official ''Council conclusions'', as they instead end by more broad political ''Statements'' on some cherry picked policy matters. The extraordinary meetings always end with official ''Council conclusions'' - but differs from the scheduled meetings by not being scheduled more than a year in advance, as for example in 2001 when the European Council gathered to lead the European Union's response to the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]].<ref name=\"seeToL\"/><ref name=\"Dragoman\"/>\n\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|300px|The European Council at the signing of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] in 2007]]\nSome meetings of the European Council\u2014and, before the Council was formalised, meetings of the heads of government\u2014are seen by some as turning points in the [[history of the European Union]].

However, when necessary, the Heads of State or Government could also meet as the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]] and take formal decisions in that role. Sometimes, this was even compulsory, e.g. Article 214(2) of the [[Treaty establishing the European Community]] provided (before it was amended by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) that \u2018[[Council of the European Union|the Council]], meeting ''in the composition of Heads of State or Government'' and acting by a qualified majority, shall nominate the person it intends to appoint as President of the [[European Commission|Commission]]\u2019 (emphasis added); the same rule applied in some monetary policy provisions introduced by the [[Maastricht Treaty]] (e.g. Article 109j TEC). In that case, what was politically part of a European Council meeting was legally a meeting of the [[Council of the European Union|Council of Ministers]]. When the European Council, already introduced into the treaties by the Single European Act, became an institution by virtue of the Treaty of Lisbon, this was no longer necessary, and the \"Council [of the European Union] meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government\", was replaced in these instances by the European Council now taking formal legally binding decisions in these cases ([[:s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 15|Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union]]).<ref>[[s:Treaty of Lisbon/Article 2 - Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|Wikisource: Article 2(3)(e), Treaty of Lisbon]]</ref>\n\nThe Treaty of Lisbon made the European Council a formal institution distinct from the (ordinary) Council of the EU, and created the present longer term and full-time presidency. As an outgrowth of the Council of the EU, the European Council had previously followed the same Presidency, rotating between each member state. While the Council of the EU retains that system, the European Council established, with no change in powers, a system of appointing an individual (without them being a national leader) for a two-and-a-half-year term - which can be renewed for the same person only once.<ref name=\"Constitution info\">{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=The Union's institutions: The European Council|work=|publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]]|date=21 February 2001|url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/constitution/europeancouncil_en.htm|doi=|accessdate=12 July 2007}}</ref> Following the ratification of the treaty in December 2009, the European Council elected the then-[[Prime Minister of Belgium]] [[Herman Van Rompuy]] as its first permanent president (resigning from Belgian Prime Minister).<ref name=\"consensus\">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8367589.stm|title=BBC News&nbsp;\u2014 Belgian PM Van Rompuy is named as new EU president|accessdate=20 November 2009 | date=20 November 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Powers and functions==\nThe European Council is an official [[Institutions of the European Union|institution]] of the EU, mentioned by the [[Lisbon Treaty]] as a body which \"shall provide the Union with the necessary impetus for its development\". Essentially it defines the EU's policy agenda and has thus been considered to be the motor of [[European integration]].<ref name=\"seeToL\"/> Beyond the need to provide \"impetus\", the Council has developed further roles: to \"settle issues outstanding from discussions at a lower level\", to lead in foreign policy&nbsp;\u2014 acting externally as a \"collective [[Head of State]]\", \"formal [[ratification]] of important documents\" and \"involvement in the negotiation of the [[Treaties of the European Union|treaty changes]]\".<ref name=\"Europa Council\"/><ref name=\"Dragoman\"/>\n\nSince the institution is composed of national leaders, it gathers the executive power of the member states and has thus a great influence in high-profile policy areas as for example [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|foreign policy]]. It also exercises powers of appointment, such as appointment of [[President of the European Council|its own President]], the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]], and the [[President of the European Central Bank]]. It proposes, to the [[European Parliament]], a candidate for [[President of the European Commission]]. Moreover, the European Council influences police and justice planning, the composition of the Commission, matters relating to the organisation of the rotating Council presidency, the suspension of membership rights, and changing the voting systems through the [[Passerelle Clause]]. Although the European Council has no direct legislative power, under the \"emergency brake\" procedure, a state outvoted in the [[Council of Ministers (European Union)|Council of Ministers]] may refer contentious legislation to the European Council.

The meetings used to be regularly attended by the national foreign minister as well, and the Commission President likewise accompanied by another member of the Commission.

The [[President of the European Parliament]] also attends to give an opening speech outlining the [[European Parliament]]'s position before talks begin.<ref name=\"seeToL\"/><ref name=\"Europa Council\"/>\n\nAdditionally, the negotiations involve a large number of other people working behind the scenes. Most of those people, however, are not allowed to the conference room, except for two delegates per state to relay messages. At the push of a button members can also call for advice from a Permanent Representative via the \"Antici Group\" in an adjacent room.

The first apparent usage of the term \"euthanasia\" belongs to the historian [[Suetonius]], who described how the Emperor [[Augustus]], \"dying quickly and without suffering in the arms of his wife, Livia, experienced the 'euthanasia' he had wished for.\"<ref>Philippe Letellier, chapter: ''History and Definition of a Word,'' in ''Euthanasia: Ethical and Human Aspects'' By [[Council of Europe]]</ref> The word \"euthanasia\" was first used in a medical context by [[Francis Bacon]] in the 17th century, to refer to an easy, painless, happy death, during which it was a \"physician's responsibility to alleviate the 'physical sufferings' of the body.\" Bacon referred to an \"outward euthanasia\"\u2014the term \"outward\" he used to distinguish from a spiritual concept\u2014the euthanasia \"which regards the preparation of the soul.\"<ref>Francis Bacon: ''The Major Works by Francis Bacon,'' edited by Brian Vickers, p. 630.</ref>\n\nIn current usage, euthanasia has been defined as the \"painless inducement of a quick death\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Kohl | first = Marvin | year = 1974 | title = The Morality of Killing | publisher = Humanities Press | location = New York | page = 94 }}, quoted in Beauchamp & Davidson (1979), p 294. A similar definition is offered by Blackburn (1994) with \"the action of causing the quick and painless death of a person, or not acting to prevent it when prevention was within the agent's powers.\"</ref> However, it is argued that this approach fails to properly define euthanasia, as it leaves open a number of possible actions which would meet the requirements of the definition, but would not be seen as euthanasia. In particular, these include situations where a person kills another, painlessly, but for no reason beyond that of personal gain; or accidental deaths that are quick and painless, but not intentional.<ref name=\"BeauchampDavidson1979\">{{Cite journal| last1 = Beauchamp | first1 = Tom L. | authorlink1 = Tom Beauchamp | last2 = Davidson | first2 = Arnold I. | authorlink2 = Arnold Davidson | year = 1979 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | journal = [[Journal of Medicine and Philosophy]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 294\u2013312 | doi=10.1093/jmp/4.3.294 | pmid=501249}}</ref><ref name=\"Draper1998\">{{cite book | last = Draper | first = Heather | year = 1998 | chapter = Euthanasia | editor = Chadwick, Ruth | title = Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics | volume = 2 | publisher = Academic Press }}</ref>\n\nAnother approach incorporates the notion of [[suffering]] into the definition.<ref name=\"BeauchampDavidson1979\" /> The definition offered by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] incorporates suffering as a necessary condition, with \"the painless killing of a patient suffering from an incurable and painful disease or in an irreversible coma\",<ref>{{cite web | title = euthanasia | work = Oxford Dictionaries | date = April 2010 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | url = http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/euthanasia | accessdate = 26 April 2011 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110821152342/http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/euthanasia | archivedate = 21 August 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This approach is included in Marvin Khol and Paul Kurtz's definition of it as \"a mode or act of inducing or permitting death painlessly as a relief from suffering\".<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Kohl | first1 = Marvin | last2 = Kurtz | first2 = Paul | year = 1975 | chapter = A Plea for Beneficient Euthanasia | editor = Kohl, Marvin | title = Beneficient Euthanasia | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, New York | page = 94 }}, quoted in Beauchamp & Davidson (1979), p 295.</ref> Counterexamples can be given: such definitions may encompass killing a person suffering from an incurable disease for personal gain (such as to claim an inheritance), and commentators such as [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[Arnold Davidson]] have argued that doing so would constitute \"murder simpliciter\" rather than euthanasia.<ref name=\"BeauchampDavidson1979\" />\n\nThe third element incorporated into many definitions is that of intentionality \u2013 the death must be intended, rather than being accidental, and the intent of the action must be a \"merciful death\".<ref name=\"BeauchampDavidson1979\" /> Michael Wreen argued that \"the principal thing that distinguishes euthanasia from intentional killing simpliciter is the agent's motive: it must be a good motive insofar as the good of the person killed is concerned.\"<ref name=\"Wreen1988p639\">{{Cite journal| last = Wreen | first = Michael | year = 1988 | title = The Definition of Euthanasia | jstor = 2108012 | journal = [[Philosophy and Phenomenological Research]] | volume = 48 | doi = 10.2307/2108012 | issue = 4 | pages = 637\u201353 [639] }}</ref> Similarly, Heather Draper speaks to the importance of motive, arguing that \"the motive forms a crucial part of arguments for euthanasia, because it must be in the best interests of the person on the receiving end.\"<ref name=\"Draper1998\" /> Definitions such as that offered by the [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on [[Medical Ethics]] take this path, where euthanasia is defined as \"a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering.\"<ref name=\"Harris-2001\"/> Beauchamp and Davidson also highlight [[Baruch Brody]]'s \"an act of euthanasia is one in which one person&nbsp;...

In his work, ''Euthanasia medica'', he chose this ancient Greek word and, in doing so, distinguished between ''euthanasia interior'', the preparation of the soul for death, and ''euthanasia exterior'', which was intended to make the end of life easier and painless, in exceptional circumstances by shortening life. That the ancient meaning of an easy death came to the fore again in the [[early modern period]] can be seen from its definition in the 18th century [[Grosses vollst\u00e4ndiges Universal-Lexicon Aller Wissenschafften und K\u00fcnste|''Zedlers Universallexikon'']]:\n\n<blockquote>Euthanasia: a very gentle and quiet death, which happens without painful convulsions. The word comes from \u03b5\u03c5, ''bene'', well, and \u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, ''mors'', death.<ref>''Zedlers Universallexikon'', Vol. 08, p. 1150, published 1732\u201354.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe concept of euthanasia in the sense of alleviating the process of death goes back to the medical historian, [[Karl Friedrich Heinrich Marx]], who drew on Bacon's philosophical ideas. According to Marx, a doctor had a moral duty to ease the suffering of death through encouragement, support and mitigation using medication. Such an \"alleviation of death\" reflected the contemporary ''[[zeitgeist]]'', but was brought into the medical canon of responsibility for the first time by Marx. Marx also stressed the distinction between the theological care of the soul of sick people from the physical care and medical treatment by doctors.<ref>{{NDB|16|327|328|Marx, Karl, Mediziner|Markwart Michler|116814357}}</ref><ref>Helge Dvorak: ''Biographisches Lexikon der Deutschen Burschenschaft.''

In 1891, Alder argued that those suffering from overwhelming pain should have the right to commit suicide, and, furthermore, that it should be permissible for a doctor to assist \u2013 thus making Adler the first \"prominent American\" to argue for suicide in cases where people were suffering from chronic illness.<ref name=\"Dowbiggin\">{{cite book | last = Dowbiggin | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Dowbiggin | year = 2003 | title = A merciful end: the euthanasia movement in modern America | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-515443-6 | pages = 10\u201313 }}</ref> Both Ingersoll and Adler argued for voluntary euthanasia of adults suffering from terminal ailments.<ref name=\"Dowbiggin\"/> Dowbiggin argues that by breaking down prior moral objections to euthanasia and suicide, Ingersoll and Adler enabled others to stretch the definition of euthanasia.<ref name=\"Dowbiggin2003p13\">{{cite book | last = Dowbiggin | first = Ian | authorlink = Ian Dowbiggin | year = 2003 | title = A merciful end: the euthanasia movement in modern America | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-515443-6 | page = 13 }}</ref>\n\nThe first attempt to legalise euthanasia took place in the United States, when [[Henry Thomas Hunt|Henry Hunt]] introduced legislation into the [[Ohio General Assembly|General Assembly]] of [[Ohio]] in 1906.<ref name=\"Appel2004\">{{cite journal | last = Appel | first = Jacob | authorlink = Jacob M.

He explains that the Nazi version of \"euthanasia\" was based on the work of [[Adolf Jost]], who published ''The Right to Death'' (Das Recht auf den Tod) in 1895. Lifton writes: \n\n<blockquote>Jost argued that control over the death of the individual must ultimately belong to the social organism, the state. This concept is in direct opposition to the Anglo-American concept of euthanasia, which emphasizes the ''individual's'' 'right to die' or 'right to death' or 'right to his or her own death,' as the ultimate human claim. In contrast, Jost was pointing to the state's right to kill.&nbsp;... Ultimately the argument was biological: 'The rights to death [are] the key to the fitness of life.' The state must own death\u2014must kill\u2014in order to keep the social organism alive and healthy.<ref>Basic Books 1986, 46</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn modern terms, the use of \"euthanasia\" in the context of Action T4 is seen to be a [[wikt:euphemism|euphemism]] to disguise a program of [[genocide]], in which people were killed on the grounds of \"disabilities, religious beliefs, and discordant individual values\".<ref name=\"Michalsen2006\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Michalsen A, Reinhart K |title=\"Euthanasia\": A confusing term, abused under the Nazi regime and misused in present end-of-life debate |journal=Intensive Care Med |volume=32 |issue=9 |pages=1304\u201310 |date=September 2006 |pmid=16826394 |doi=10.1007/s00134-006-0256-9}}</ref> Compared to the discussions of euthanasia that emerged post-war, the Nazi program may have been worded in terms that appear similar to the modern use of \"euthanasia\", but there was no \"mercy\" and the patients were not necessarily terminally ill.<ref name=\"Michalsen2006\" /> Despite these differences, historian and euthanasia opponent [[Ian Dowbiggin]] writes that \"the origins of Nazi euthanasia, like those of the American euthanasia movement, predate the Third Reich and were intertwined with the history of eugenics and Social Darwinism, and with efforts to discredit traditional morality and ethics.\"<ref name=\"Dowbiggin\"/>{{rp|65}}\n\n=== The 1949 New York State Petition for Euthanasia and Catholic opposition ===\nOn 6 January 1949, the Euthanasia Society of America presented to the [[New York State Legislature]] a petition to legalize euthanasia, signed by 379 leading Protestant and Jewish ministers, the largest group of religious leaders ever to have taken this stance. A similar petition had been sent to the New York Legislature in 1947, signed by approximately 1,000 New York physicians. [[Roman Catholic]] religious leaders criticized the petition, saying that such a bill would \"legalize a suicide-murder pact\" and a \"rationalization of the fifth commandment of God, 'Thou Shalt Not Kill.'\"<ref name=\"Mercy Killing\">[[The Moncton Transcript]]. \"Ministers Ask Mercy Killing.\" 6 January 1949.</ref> The Right Reverend Robert E.

However, the petition did not result in any legal changes.<ref name=\"Dowbiggin\"/>\n\n==Euthanasia debate==\nHistorically, the euthanasia debate has tended to focus on a number of key concerns. According to euthanasia opponent [[Ezekiel Emanuel]], proponents of euthanasia have presented four main arguments: a) that people have a right to [[self-determination]], and thus should be allowed to choose their own fate; b) assisting a subject to die might be a better choice than requiring that they continue to suffer; c) the distinction between passive euthanasia, which is often permitted, and active euthanasia, which is not substantive (or that the underlying principle\u2013the [[doctrine of double effect]]\u2013is unreasonable or unsound); and d) permitting euthanasia will not necessarily lead to unacceptable consequences. Pro-euthanasia activists often point to countries like the [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], and states like [[Oregon]], where euthanasia has been legalized, to argue that it is mostly unproblematic.\n\nSimilarly, Emanuel argues that there are four major arguments presented by opponents of euthanasia: a) not all deaths are painful; b) alternatives, such as cessation of active treatment, combined with the use of effective pain relief, are available; c) the distinction between active and passive euthanasia is morally significant; and d) legalising euthanasia will place society on a [[Euthanasia and the slippery slope|slippery slope]],<ref>{{Cite book |publisher = Times Books |isbn = 978-0-8129-2790-0 |location = New York |title = Forced Exit |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1006883M/Forced_exit |author = Wesley J.

Once it became clear that Earth was merely one planet amongst countless bodies in the universe, the theory of extraterrestrial life started to become a topic in the scientific community. The best known early-modern proponent of such ideas was the Italian philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who argued in the 16th century for an infinite universe in which every star is surrounded by its own [[planetary system]]. Bruno wrote that other worlds \"have no less virtue nor a nature different to that of our earth\" and, like Earth, \"contain animals and inhabitants\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |title=Giordano Bruno: On the Infinite Universe and Worlds (De l'Infinito Universo et Mondi) Introductory Epistle: Argument of the Third Dialogue |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013120648/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/brunoiuw0.htm#IUW0III |archivedate=13 October 2014 |df=}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 17th century, the Czech astronomer [[Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita]] mused that \"if Jupiter has (...) inhabitants (...) they must be larger and more beautiful than the inhabitants of Earth, in proportion to the [characteristics] of the two spheres\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cosmovisions.com/Rheita.htm |publisher=cosmovisions.com |title=Rheita.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Baroque]] literature such as ''The Other World: The Societies and Governments of the Moon'' by [[Cyrano de Bergerac]], extraterrestrial societies are presented as humoristic or ironic parodies of earthly society.\nThe didactic poet [[Henry More]] took up the classical theme of the Greek [[Democritus]] in \"Democritus Platonissans, or an Essay Upon the Infinity of Worlds\" (1647).\nIn \"The Creation: a Philosophical Poem in Seven Books\" (1712), Sir [[Richard Blackmore]] observed: \"We may pronounce each orb sustains a race / Of living things adapted to the place\". With the new relative viewpoint that the Copernican revolution had wrought, he suggested \"our world's sunne / Becomes a starre elsewhere\". [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontanelle]]'s \"Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds\" (translated into English in 1686) offered similar excursions on the possibility of extraterrestrial life, expanding, rather than denying, the creative sphere of a Maker.\n\nThe possibility of extraterrestrials remained a widespread speculation as scientific discovery accelerated. [[William Herschel]], the discoverer of [[Uranus]], was one of many 18th\u201319th-century astronomers who believed that the [[Solar System]] is populated by alien life. Other luminaries of the period who championed \"cosmic pluralism\" included [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Benjamin Franklin]].

It has become a pop culture trope given less-than-serious treatment in popular entertainment.\n\nIn the words of SETI's Frank Drake, \"All we know for sure is that the sky is not littered with powerful microwave transmitters\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://antarcticaedu.com/bio2024.htm |title=LECTURE 4: MODERN THOUGHTS ON EXTRATERRESTRIAL LIFE |work=The University of Antarctica |accessdate=25 July 2015}}</ref> Drake noted that it is entirely possible that advanced technology results in communication being carried out in some way other than conventional radio transmission. At the same time, the data returned by space probes, and giant strides in detection methods, have allowed science to begin delineating [[Planetary habitability|habitability criteria]] on other worlds, and to confirm that at least other planets are plentiful, though aliens remain a question mark. The [[Wow! signal]], detected in 1977 by a SETI project, remains a subject of speculative debate.\n\nIn 2000, [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]] [[Peter Ward (paleontologist)|Peter Ward]] and [[Astrobiology|astrobiologist]] [[Donald Brownlee]] published a book entitled ''Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe |publisher=Copernicus |first1=Peter |last1=Ward |first2=Donald |last2=Brownlee |date=2000 |bibcode=2000rewc.book.....W |isbn=978-0-387-98701-9}}</ref> In it, they discussed the [[Rare Earth hypothesis]], in which they claim that Earth-like life is rare in the [[universe]], whereas [[bacteria|microbial]] life is common. Ward and Brownlee are open to the idea of evolution on other planets that is not based on essential Earth-like characteristics (such as DNA and carbon).\n\nTheoretical physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] in 2010 warned that humans should not try to contact alien life forms. He warned that aliens might pillage Earth for resources. \"If aliens visit us, the outcome would be much as when [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] landed in [[Americas|America]], which didn't turn out well for the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]\", he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8642558.stm |work=BBC News |title=Hawking warns over alien beings |date=25 April 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2010}}</ref> [[Jared Diamond]] had earlier expressed similar concerns.<ref>{{cite book |chapter=Chapter 12 |title=The Third Chimpanzee: The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal |publisher=Harper Perennial |first=Jared M. |last=Diamond |date=2006 |isbn=978-0-06-084550-6}}</ref>\n\nIn November 2011, the [[White House]] released an official response to two petitions asking the [[U.S. government]] to acknowledge formally that aliens have visited Earth and to disclose any intentional withholding of government interactions with extraterrestrial beings.

He wrote approximately 2,900 poems, two autobiographical novels, four plays, and several essays.\n\nCummings is associated with [[Modernist literature|modernist]] [[free verse|free-form poetry]]. Much of his work has original syntax and uses lower case spellings for poetic expression. His use of lower case extended to rendering even the personal pronoun ''I'' as ''i'', as in the phrase \"i shall go\".

His journals are replete with references to ''\"le bon Dieu\"'', as well as prayers for inspiration in his poetry and artwork (such as \"Bon Dieu! may I some day do something truly great. amen.\"). Cummings \"also prayed for strength to be his essential self ('may I be I is the only prayer\u2014not may I be great or good or beautiful or wise or strong'), and for relief of spirit in times of depression ('almighty God!

Upon graduating, he worked for a book dealer.<ref Name=\"PoetryF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/e-e-cummings|title=E. E.

Due to an administrative mix-up, Cummings was not assigned to an ambulance unit for five weeks, during which time he stayed in Paris. He fell in love with the city, to which he would return throughout his life.<ref name=utexas>{{cite web|url=http://research.hrc.utexas.edu:8080/hrcxtf/view?docId=ead/00030.xml|title=E. E. Cummings: An Inventory of His Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center|publisher=Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center |accessdate=May 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDuring their service in the ambulance corps, the two young writers sent letters home that drew the attention of the military censors. They were known to prefer the company of French soldiers over fellow ambulance drivers. The two openly expressed anti-war views; Cummings spoke of his lack of hatred for the Germans.<ref>Friedman, Norman \"Cummings, E[dward] E[stlin]\", in Steven Serafin, ''The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature'', 2003, Continuum, p. 244.</ref> On September 21, 1917, five months after starting his belated assignment, Cummings and a friend, [[William Slater Brown]], were arrested by the French military on suspicion of espionage and undesirable activities. They were held for three and a half months in a military detention camp at the ''[[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9|D\u00e9p\u00f4t de Triage]]'', in [[La Fert\u00e9-Mac\u00e9]], Orne, Normandy.<ref name=utexas/>\n\nThey were imprisoned with other detainees in a large room. Cummings' father failed to obtain his son's release through diplomatic channels, and in December 1917 he wrote a letter to President [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Cummings was released on December 19, 1917, and Brown was released two months later. Cummings used his prison experience as the basis for his novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'' (1922), about which [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said, \"Of all the work by young men who have sprung up since 1920 one book survives\u2014''The Enormous Room'' by e e cummings... Those few who cause books to live have not been able to endure the thought of its mortality.\"<ref>Bloom, p. 1814.</ref> <!-- Did F Scott Fitzgerald use upper- or lower-case for Cummings' name?  In a direct quote, it matters. -->\n\nCummings returned to the United States on New Year's Day 1918. Later in 1918 he was drafted into the army. He served in the [[12th Division (United States)|12th Division]] at [[Camp Devens|Camp Devens, Massachusetts]], until November 1918.<ref>Kennedy, p. 186.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.military.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~worldwarone/WWI/divisions.html#Twelfth|title=Data on U.S. Army Divisions during World War I, WWI, The Great War}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nBuffalo Bill's\ndefunct\n        who used to\n        ride a watersmooth-silver\n                                  stallion\nand break onetwothreefourfive pigeonsjustlikethat\n                                                  Jesus\n\nhe was a handsome man\n                      and what i want to know is\nhow do you like your blueeyed boy\nMister Death\n</poem>\n |source =\"Buffalo Bill's\" (1920)}}\n\n===Post-war years===\nCummings returned to Paris in 1921 and had lived there for two years before returning to New York. His collection ''Tulips and Chimneys'' was published in 1923 and his inventive use of grammar and syntax is evident. The book was heavily cut by his editor. ''XLI Poems'' was published in 1925. With these collections, Cummings made his reputation as an avant garde poet.<ref Name=\"PoetryF\"/>\n\nDuring the rest of the 1920s and 1930s, Cummings returned to Paris a number of times, and traveled throughout Europe, meeting, among others, artist [[Pablo Picasso]]. In 1931 Cummings traveled to the [[Soviet Union]], recounting his experiences in ''[[Eimi (book)|Eimi]]'', published two years later. During these years Cummings also traveled to Northern Africa and [[Mexico]]. He worked as an essayist and portrait artist for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine (1924\u20131927).\n\nIn 1926, Cummings' parents were in a car crash; only his mother survived, although she was severely injured. Cummings later described the crash in the following passage from his ''i: six nonlectures'' series given at Harvard (as part of the [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures]]) in 1952 and 1953:\n\n<blockquote>\nA locomotive cut the car in half, killing my father instantly. When two brakemen jumped from the halted train, they saw a woman standing \u2013 dazed but erect \u2013 beside a mangled machine; with blood spouting (as the older said to me) out of her head. One of her hands (the younger added) kept feeling her dress, as if trying to discover why it was wet. These men took my sixty-six-year old mother by the arms and tried to lead her toward a nearby farmhouse; but she threw them off, strode straight to my father's body, and directed a group of scared spectators to cover him. When this had been done (and only then) she let them lead her away.\n</blockquote>\n\nHis father's death had a profound effect on Cummings, who entered a new period in his artistic life. He began to focus on more important aspects of life in his poetry. He started this new period by paying homage to his father in the poem \"my father moved through dooms of love\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |title=My father moved through dooms of love |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315070117/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~richie/poetry/html/aupoem114.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | first = Gary | last = Lane | authorlink =  | year = 1976 | title = I Am: A Study of E.

His longest relationship lasted more than three decades, a common-law marriage to Marion Morehouse.\n\nCummings' first marriage, to Elaine Orr, began as a love affair in 1918 while she was still married to [[Scofield Thayer]], one of Cummings' friends from Harvard. During this time he wrote a good deal of his erotic poetry.<ref name=\"Kennedy\">''Selected Poems,'' Ed. Richard S. Kennedy, Liveright, 1994.</ref> After divorcing Thayer, Elaine married Cummings on March 19, 1924. The couple had a daughter together out of wedlock. However, the couple separated after two months of marriage and divorced less than nine months later.\n\nCummings married his second wife Anne Minnerly Barton on May 1, 1929, and they separated three years later in 1932. That same year, Anne obtained a [[Mexican divorce]]; it was not officially recognized in the United States until August 1934. Anne died in 1970 aged 72.\n\nIn 1934, after his separation from his second wife, Cummings met Marion Morehouse, a fashion model and photographer. Although it is not clear whether the two were ever formally married, Morehouse lived with Cummings in a [[common-law marriage]] until his death in 1962. She died on May 18, 1969,<ref>''Marion Morehouse Cummings, Poet's Widow, Top Model, Dies'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 1969.</ref> while living at 4 [[Patchin Place]], [[Greenwich Village]], New York City, where Cummings had resided since September 1924.<ref>Sawyer-Lau\u00e7anno, p. 255.</ref>\n\n===Political views===\nAccording to his testimony in ''[[Eimi (book)|EIMI]]'', Cummings had little interest in politics until his trip to the Soviet Union in 1931,<ref name=Blumenkranz>Carla Blumenkranz, [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180437 \"The Enormous Poem: When E.E. Cummings Repunctuated Stalinism.\"] Poetry Foundation. www.poetryfoundation.org/</ref> after which he shifted rightward on many political and social issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://college.cengage.com/english/lauter/heath/4e/students/author_pages/modern/cummings_ee.html|title=Heath Anthology of American Literature E.E. cummings \u2013 Author Page}}</ref> Despite his radical and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] public image, he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and later, an ardent supporter of [[Joseph McCarthy]].<ref>Wetzsteon, Ross. 'Republic of Dreams: Greenwich Village: The American Bohemia, 1910\u20131960', pp. 449 [https://books.google.com/books?id=o2DB77ccf9sC&pg=PA449 Google Books]</ref>\n\n==Work==\n\n===Poetry===\nDespite Cummings' familiarity with [[avant-garde]] styles (likely affected by the ''[[Calligrammes]]'' of French poet [[Apollinaire]], according to a contemporary observation<ref>Taupin, Rene, ''The Influence of French Symbolism on Modern American Poetry 1927'' (Trans. William Pratt), AMS Inc, New York 1985  {{ISBN|0404615791}}</ref>), much of his work is quite traditional. Many of his poems are [[sonnet]]s, albeit often with a modern twist. He occasionally used the [[blues#Lyrics|blues]] form and [[acrostics]]. Cummings' poetry often deals with themes of love and nature, as well as the relationship of the individual to the masses and to the world. His poems are also often rife with satire.\n\nWhile his poetic forms and themes share an affinity with the [[Romanticism|Romantic tradition]], Cummings' work universally shows a particular idiosyncrasy of [[syntax]], or way of arranging individual words into larger phrases and sentences. Many of his most striking poems do not involve any typographical or punctuation innovations at all, but purely syntactic ones.\n\n<!---NB **The typography is Cummings' original setting**--->\n{{Quote box |width=350px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\ni carry your heart with me(i carry it in\nmy heart)i am never without it(anywhere\ni go you go,my dear;and whatever is done\nby only me is your doing,my darling)\n                                            i fear\nno fate(for you are my fate,my sweet)i want\nno world(for beautiful you are my world,my true)\nand it's you are whatever a moon has always meant\nand whatever a sun will always sing is you\n\nhere is the deepest secret nobody knows\n(here is the root of the root and the bud of the bud\nand the sky of the sky of a tree called life;which grows\nhigher than soul can hope or mind can hide)\nand this is the wonder that's keeping the stars apart\n\ni carry your heart(i carry it in my heart)\n</poem>\n |source =From \"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in\" (1952)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/179622 \"i carry your heart with me(i carry it in\"] at the Poetry Foundation.</ref>}}\n\nAs well as being influenced by notable [[Modernist literature|modernists]], including [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[Ezra Pound]], Cummings in his early work drew upon the [[Imagism|imagist]] experiments of [[Amy Lowell]]. Later, his visits to Paris exposed him to [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]], which he reflected in his work. He began to rely on symbolism and allegory, where he once had used simile and metaphor. In his later work, he rarely used comparisons that required objects that were not previously mentioned in the poem, choosing to use a symbol instead. Due to this, his later poetry is \"frequently more lucid, more moving, and more profound than his earlier.\"<ref>Friedman, Norman. ''E. E. Cummings the Art of His Poetry.'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins, 1967. p. 89.</ref> Cummings also liked to incorporate imagery of nature and death into much of his poetry.\n\nWhile some of his poetry is [[free verse]] (with no concern for [[rhyme]] or [[meter (poetry)|meter]]), many have a recognizable sonnet structure of 14 lines, with an intricate rhyme scheme. A number of his poems feature a typographically exuberant style, with words, parts of words, or punctuation symbols scattered across the page, often making little sense until read aloud, at which point the meaning and emotion become clear. Cummings, who was also a painter, understood the importance of presentation, and used typography to \"paint a picture\" with some of his poems.<ref>{{cite journal | first = Iain | last = Landles | authorlink = Iain Landles | year = 2001 | title = An Analysis of Two Poems by E. E. Cummings | journal=SPRING, the Journal of the E. E. Cummings Society | volume = 10 | pages = 31\u201343 }}</ref>\n\nThe seeds of Cummings' unconventional style appear well established even in his earliest work. At age six, he wrote to his father:\n\n<blockquote><small>FATHER DEAR. BE, YOUR FATHER-GOOD AND GOOD,<br>\nHE IS GOOD NOW, IT IS NOT GOOD TO SEE IT RAIN,<br>\nFATHER DEAR IS, IT, DEAR, NO FATHER DEAR,<br>\nLOVE, YOU DEAR,<br>\nESTLIN.</small><ref>''Selected letters of E. E. Cummings'', (1972) Edward Estlin Cummings, Frederick Wilcox Dupee, George Stade. University of Michigan p. 3 {{ISBN|978-0-233-95637-4}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nFollowing his autobiographical novel, ''[[The Enormous Room]]'', Cummings' first published work was a collection of poems titled ''[[Tulips and Chimneys]]'' (1923). This work was the public's first encounter with his characteristic eccentric use of grammar and punctuation.\n\nSome of Cummings' most famous poems do not involve much, if any, odd typography or punctuation, but still carry his unmistakable style, particularly in unusual and impressionistic word order.\n\n{{Quote box |width=300px |align=right ||salign=right\n |quote  =<poem>\nanyone lived in a pretty how town\n(with up so floating many bells down)\nspring summer autumn winter\nhe sang his didn't he danced his did\n\nWomen and men (both little and small)\ncared for anyone not at all\nthey sowed their isn't they reaped their same\nsun moon stars rain\n</poem>\n |source =From \"[[anyone lived in a pretty how town]]\" (1940)<ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/11856 \"anyone lived in a pretty how town\" at the Poetry Foundation]</ref>}}\n\nCummings' work often does not proceed in accordance with the conventional combinatorial rules that generate typical English sentences (for example, \"they sowed their isn't\"). In addition, a number of Cummings' poems feature, in part or in whole, intentional misspellings, and several incorporate phonetic spellings intended to represent particular dialects. Cummings also made use of inventive formations of compound words, as in \"in Just\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/images/modeng/public/Cum2Dia/CumDi580.jpg |title=in Just}}</ref> which features words such as \"mud-luscious\", \"puddle-wonderful\", and \"eddieandbill.\" This poem is part of a sequence of poems titled ''Chansons Innocentes'';<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |title=''Chansons Innocentes'' |access-date=October 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051227115128/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15398 |archive-date=December 27, 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> it has many references comparing the \"balloonman\" to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], the mythical creature that is half-goat and half-man. Literary critic [[R.P.

A notable example of his versatility is an introduction he wrote for a collection of the comic strip ''[[Krazy Kat]]''.\n\n===Controversy===\nCummings is known for controversial subject matter, as he wrote numerous erotic poems. He also sometimes included ethnic slurs in his writing. For instance, in his 1950 collection ''Xaipe: Seventy-One Poems'', Cummings published two poems containing words that caused outrage in some quarters.<ref>Friedman, Norman, and Harry Thornton Moore. ''E. E. Cummings the Growth of a Writer''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1964. pp. 153\u201354.</ref>\n\n:<poem>\n:one day a nigger\n:caught in his hand\n:a little star no bigger\n:than not to understand\n\n:i'll never let you go\n:until you've made me white\"\n:so she did and now\n:stars shine at night.<ref name=\"Cummings, 1950\">Cummings, ''Xaipe, Seventy-one Poems''.

All the fuss perplexed him. The poems were commenting on prejudice, he pointed out, and not condoning it. He intended to show how derogatory words cause people to see others in terms of stereotypes rather than as individuals. \"America (which turns Hungarian into 'hunky' & Irishman into 'mick' and Norwegian into 'square- head') is to blame for 'kike,'\" he said.<ref Name=\"Reef\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[William Carlos Williams]] spoke out in his defense.<ref Name=\"Reef\">''E. Cummings'' (2006) by Catherine Reef, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt p. 115 {{ISBN|978-0-618-56849-9}}</ref>{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Plays===\nDuring his lifetime, Cummings published four plays. ''HIM'', a three-act play, was first produced in 1928 by the [[Provincetown Players]] in New York City. The production was directed by James Light. The play's main characters are \"Him\", a playwright, portrayed by [[William Johnstone (actor)|William Johnstone]], and \"Me\", his girlfriend, portrayed by [[Erin O'Brien-Moore]].\n\nCummings said of the unorthodox play:\n<blockquote>Relax and give the play a chance to strut its stuff\u2014relax, stop wondering what it is all 'about'\u2014like many strange and familiar things, Life included, this play isn't 'about,' it simply is. . . . Don't try to enjoy it, let it try to enjoy you. <small>DON'T TRY TO UNDERSTAND IT, LET IT TRY TO UNDERSTAND YOU.</small>\"<ref>Kennedy, p. 295.</ref></blockquote>\n\n''Anthropos, or the Future of Art'' is a short, one-act play that Cummings contributed to the anthology ''Whither, Whither or After Sex, What? A Symposium to End Symposium''. The play consists of dialogue between Man, the main character, and three \"infrahumans\", or inferior beings. The word ''[[Greek language|anthropos]]'' is the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for \"man\", in the sense of \"mankind\".\n\n''Tom, A Ballet'' is a ballet based on ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. The ballet is detailed in a \"synopsis\" as well as descriptions of four \"episodes\", which were published by Cummings in 1935. It has never been performed.<ref>[http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html GVSU.edu The E. E. Cummings Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050423191607/http://www.gvsu.edu/english/cummings/Tom.html |date=April 23, 2005 }}.</ref>\n\n''[[Santa Claus: A Morality]]'' was probably Cummings' most successful play. It is an allegorical Christmas fantasy presented in one act of five scenes. The play was inspired by his daughter Nancy, with whom he was reunited in 1946. It was first published in the Harvard College magazine, ''Wake''. The play's main characters are Santa Claus, his family (Woman and Child), Death, and Mob. At the outset of the play, Santa Claus' family has disintegrated due to their lust for knowledge (Science). After a series of events, however, Santa Claus' faith in love and his rejection of the materialism and disappointment he associates with Science are reaffirmed, and he is reunited with Woman and Child.\n\n===Name and capitalization===\nCummings' publishers and others have often echoed the unconventional [[orthography]] in his poetry by writing his name in lowercase and without periods ([[full stop]]s), but normal orthography for his name (uppercase and periods) is supported by scholarship and preferred by publishers today.<ref name=\"friedman92\" /> Cummings himself used both the lowercase and capitalized versions, though he most often signed his name with capitals.<ref name=\"friedman92\">{{cite journal | last = Friedman | first =  Norman | year = 1992 | title = Not \"e. e. cummings\" | journal=Spring | volume = 1 | pages = 114\u201321 | url = http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/caps.htm | accessdate = December 13, 2005 }}</ref>\n\nThe use of lowercase for his initials was popularized in part by the title of some books, particularly in the 1960s, printing his name in lower case on the cover and spine. In the preface to ''E. E. Cummings: The Growth of a Writer'' by Norman Friedman, critic Harry T. Moore notes Cummings \"had his name put legally into lower case, and in his later books the titles and his name were always in lower case.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Friedman | first = Norman | title = E.

Moore to make such a stupid & childish statement about Cummings & his signature.\" On February 27, 1951, Cummings wrote to his French translator D.

E. Cummings can be safely capitalized; it was one of his publishers, not he himself, who lowercased his name.\"<ref name=\"chicago84\">{{cite book |publisher=Chicago University Press|year=2010|title=Chicago Manual of Style|edition=16|section=Captalization of Personal Names|page=388}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nIn 1943, modern dancer and choreographer [[Jean Erdman]] presented \"The Transformations of Medusa, Forever and Sunsmell\" with a commissioned score by [[John Cage]] and a spoken text from the title poem by E. E. Cummings, sponsored by the [[Arts Club of Chicago]]. Erdman also choreographed \"Twenty Poems\" (1960), a cycle of E. E.

The waterway, which is actually not a [[river]] despite its name, connects [[Upper New York Bay]] on its south end to [[Long Island Sound]] on its north end. It separates the borough of [[Queens]] on [[Long Island]] from [[the Bronx]] on the [[North America]]n mainland, and also divides [[Manhattan]] from Queens and [[Brooklyn]], which are also on Long Island.<ref name=encnyc>Hodges, Godfrey. \"East RIver\" in Jackson, pp.393\u201393</ref> Because of its connection to [[Long Island Sound]], it was once also known as the ''Sound River''.<ref>[[John Montresor|Montr\u00e9sor, John]] (1766). ''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/gmd:@field(NUMBER+@band(g3804n+ar110401)) A plan of the city of New-York & its environs]''. London.</ref> The tidal strait changes its direction of flow frequently, and is subject to strong fluctuations in its current, which are accentuated by its narrowness and variety of depths. The waterway is navigable for its entire length of {{convert|16|mi}}, and was historically the center of maritime activities in the city, although that is no longer the case.<ref name=encnyc /><ref name=fed420 />\n\n==Formation and description==\n{{see also|Hell Gate}}\n\nTechnically a [[drowned valley]], like the other waterways around New York City,<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.5</ref> the strait was formed approximately 11,000 years ago at the end of the [[Last glacial period#Wisconsinan glaciation.2C in North America|Wisconsin glaciation]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Staff|title=The East River Flows From Prehistoric Times To Today |url=http://www.qgazette.com/news/2005-07-20/features/049.html |newspaper=The Queens Gazette |date=July 20, 2005 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}</ref> The distinct change in the shape of the strait between the lower and upper portions is evidence of this glacial activity.  The upper portion (from [[Long Island Sound]] to [[Hell Gate]]), running largely perpendicular to the glacial motion, is wide, meandering, and has deep narrow bays on both banks, scoured out by the glacier's movement.  The lower portion (from Hell Gate to [[New York Bay]]) runs north-south, parallel to the glacial motion.  It is much narrower, with straight banks.  The bays that exist, as well as those that used to exist before being filled in by human activity, are largely wide and shallow.\n\n[[File:PSM V28 D451 Hell gate new york.jpg|thumb|325px|left|A navigation map for [[Hell Gate]] from c.1885, after many of the obstructions had been removed.]]\n\nThe section known as \"Hell Gate\" \u2013 from the Dutch name ''Hellegat'' or \"passage to hell\" given to the entire river in 1614 by explorer [[Adriaen Block]] when he passed through it in his ship ''Tyger''<ref name=\"fed420\">{{cite fednyc}} pp.419\u201320</ref><ref name=wolfe /> \u2013 is a narrow, turbulent, and particularly treacherous stretch of the river.  Tides from the Long Island Sound, New York Harbor and the [[Harlem River]] meet there, making it difficult to navigate, especially because of the number of rocky islets which once dotted it, with names such as \"Frying Pan\", \"Pot, Bread and Cheese\", \"Hen and Chicken\", \"Nigger Head\", \"Heel Top\"; \"Flood\"; and \"Gridiron\", roughly 12 islets and reefs in all,<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2104), p.91</ref> all of which led to a number of shipwrecks, including the British [[frigate]] ''Hussar'' which sank in 1780 while carrying gold and silver intended to pay British troops. The stretch has since been cleared of rocks and widened.<ref name=wolfe>Wolfe, Gerard R. \"Hell Gate and Hell Gate Bridge\" in Jackson, pp.588\u201389</ref> [[Washington Irving]] wrote of Hell Gate that the current sounded \"like a bull bellowing for more drink\" at half tide, whilte at full tide it slept \"as soundly as an alderman after dinner.\" He said it was like \"a peaceable fellow enough when he has no liquor at all, or when he has a skinful, but who, when half-seas over, plays the very devil.\"<ref name=fed420 />  The tidal regime is complex, with the two major tides \u2013 from the Long Island Sound and from the Atlantic Ocean \u2013 separated by about two hours; and this is without consideration of the tidal influence of the Harlem River, all of which creates a \"dangerous cataract\", as one ship's captain put it.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.92\u201393</ref>\n\nThe river is navigable for its entire length of {{convert|16|mi}}.  In 1939 it was reported that the stretch from [[The Battery (Manhattan)|The Battery]] to the former [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]] near [[Wallabout Bay]], a run of about {{convert|1000|yd}}, was {{convert|40|ft}} deep, the long section from there, running to the west of Roosevelt Island, through Hell Gate and to [[Throg's Neck]] was at least {{convert|35|ft}} deep, and then eastward from there the river was, at mean low tide, {{convert|168|ft}} deep.<ref name=fed420 />\n\nThe broadness of the river's channel south of Roosevelt Island is caused by the dipping of the hardy [[Fordham gneiss]] which underlies the island under the less strong [[Inwood marble]] which lies under the river bed.<ref name=concrete90 />  Why the river turns to the east as it approaches the three lower Manhattan bridges is currently geologically unknown.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.90\u201391</ref>\n\n===Islands===\nIn the stretch of the river between Manhattan Island and the borough of [[Queens]], lies [[Roosevelt Island]], a narrow (maximum width {{convert|800|ft}}) {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} long island consisting of {{convert|147|acre|km2}}. Politically part of Manhattan, it begins at around the level of East 46th Street of that borough and runs up to around East 86th Street.  Formerly called Blackwell's Island and Welfare Island, and now named after President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], it was the site of a [[prison|penitentiary]], and a number of hospitals, but now consists primarily of apartment buildings, park land, and the ruins of older buildings.  It is connected to Queens by the [[Roosevelt Island Bridge]], to Manhattan by the [[Roosevelt Island Tramway]], and to both by a [[Roosevelt Island (IND 63rd Street Line)|subway station]]. The [[Queensboro Bridge]] runs across Roosevelt Island, but no longer has a passenger elevator connection to it, as it did in the past.  The abrupt termination of the island on its north end is due to an extension of the [[125th Street Fault]].<ref name=concrete90 />\n\nOther islands in the river are [[U Thant Island]] \u2013 formerly Belmont Island \u2013 south of Roosevelt Island, which was named after [[U Thant]], the former [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]; and [[Mill Rock]], [[Wards and Randalls Island]]s, which have been joined together by landfill, and are used as park land, for a stadium, and to support the [[Triborough Bridge]] and the [[Hell Gate Bridge]], [[Rikers Island]], a small island bought by the city in 1884 to be a prison farm and expanded with landfill<ref>Steinberg, p 148</ref> from under {{convert|100|acre|ha}} to over {{convert|400|acres|ha}},<ref>Steinberg, p.214</ref> which is currently the site of the city's primary jail, and [[North and South Brother Island, New York|North and South Brother Islands]], all of which lie north of Roosevelt Island.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n[[File:Manhattan1781.jpg|thumb|left|237px|A map from 1781]]\n\n===Tributaries===\n\nThe [[Bronx River]] drains into the East River in the northern section of the strait, and the [[Flushing River]], historically known as \"Flushing Creek\" empties into it near [[LaGuardia Airport]] via [[Flushing Bay]].\n\nNorth of [[Randalls and Wards Islands|Randalls Island]], it is joined by the [[Bronx Kill]]. Along the east of Wards Island, at approximately the strait's midpoint, it narrows into a channel called [[Hell Gate]], which is spanned by both the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge]] (formerly the Triborough), and the [[Hell Gate Bridge]]. On the south side of Wards Island, it is joined by the [[Harlem River]].\n\n[[Newtown Creek]] on Long Island drains into the East River, and forms part of the boundary between Queens and Brooklyn. The [[Gowanus Canal]] was built from [[Gowanus Creek]], which emptied into the river. Historically, there were other small streams which emptied into the river \u2013 including the Harlem Creek, one of the most significant tributaries originating in Manhattan<ref>{{cite greatest|page=70}}</ref> \u2013 but these and their associated wetlands have been filled in and built over.\n\n==History==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, the land north of the East River was occupied by the [[Siwanoy]]s, one of many groups of [[Algonquin (language)|Algonquin]]-speaking [[Lenape]]s in the area. Those of the Lenapes who lived in the northern part of Manhattan Island in a campsite known as Konaande Kongh used a landing at around the current location of East 119th street to paddle into the river in [[canoes]] fashioned from tree-trunk in order to fish.<ref>Burrows and Wallace, pp.5, 6\u20138</ref>\n\nDutch settlement of what became [[New Amsterdam]] began in 1623.<ref name=history />  Some of the earliest of the small settlements in the area were along the west bank of the East River on sites that had previously been Native American settlements.  As with the Native Americans, the river was central to their lives for transportation for trading and for fishing.<ref name=\"living\">Baard, Erik (2008) [http://www.eastrivernyc.org/content/history/living-on-the-river/index.html \"East River: Living on the River\"] ''East River NYC''</ref> They gathered marsh grass to feed their cattle, and the East River's tides helped to power mills which ground grain to flour. By 1642 there was a ferry running on the river between Manhattan island and what is now Brooklyn, and the first pier on the river was built in 1647 at Pearl and Broad Streets. After the British took over the colony in 1664, and was renamed \"New York\", the development of the waterfront continued, and a [[shipbuilding]] industry grew up once New York started exporting flour.  By the end of the 17th century, the Great Dock, located at [[Corlear's Hook]] on the East River, had been built.<ref name=\"history\">Baard, Erik (2008) [http://www.eastrivernyc.org/content/history/history-to-1815/index.html \"East River: History to 1815\"] ''East River NYC''</ref>\n\n===Narrowing the river===\nHistorically, the lower portion of the strait, which separates Manhattan from Brooklyn, was one of the busiest and most important channels in the world, particularly during the first three centuries of New York City's history. Because the water along the lower Manhattan shoreline was too shallow for large boats to tie up and unload their goods, from 1686 on \u2013 after the signing of the [[Dongan Charter]], which allowed intertidal land to be owned and sold \u2013 the shoreline was \"wharfed out\" to the high-water mark by building retaining walls that were filled in with every conceivable kind of landfill: excrement, dead animals, ships deliberately sunk in place, ship ballast, and muck dredged from the bottom of the river. On the new land were built warehouses and other structures necessary for the burgeoning sea trade Many of the \"water-lot\" grants went to the rich and powerful families of the merchant class, although some went to tradesmen. By 1700, the Manhattan bank of the river has been \"wharfed-out\" up to around [[Whitehall Street]], narrowing the strait of the river.<ref>Steinberg, pp.23\u201326</ref>\n\n[[File:Birds eye view New York City crop.jpeg|thumb|right|350px|A \"bird's-eye\" view of New York City from 1859; [[Wallabout Bay]] and the East River are in the foreground, the [[Hudson River]] and [[New York Bay]] in the background]]\n\nAfter the signing of the Montgomerie Charter in the late 1720s, another 127 acres of land along the Manhattan shore of the East River was authorized to be filled-in, this time to a point 400 feet beyond the low-water mark; the parts that had already been expanded to the low water mark \u2013 much of which had been devastated by a coastal storm in the early 1720s and a [[nor'easter]] in 1723 \u2013 were also expanded, narrowing the channel even further.  What had been quiet beach land was to become new streets and buildings, and the core of the city's sea-borne trade. This infilling went as far north as [[Corlear's Hook]]. In addition, the city was given control of the western shore of the river from [[Wallabout Bay]] south.<ref>Steinberg, pp.26\u201328; 34</ref>\n\n===American Revolution===\nExpansion of the waterfront halted during the [[American Revolution]], in which the East River played an important role early in the conflict. On August 28, 1776, while British and Hessian troops rested after besting the Americans at the [[Battle of Long Island]], General [[George Washington]] was rounding up all the boats on the east shore of the river, in what is now Brooklyn, and used them to successfully move his troops across the river \u2013 under cover of night, rain, and fog \u2013 to Manhattan island, before the British could press their advantage. Thus, though the battle was a victory for the British, the failure of [[Sir William Howe]] to destroy the Continental Army when he had the opportunity allowed the Americans to continue fighting. Without the stealthy withdrawal across the East River, the American Revolution might have ended much earlier.<ref>Stokesbury, James L.

These prisoners had come into the hands of the British after the fall of New York City on September 15, 1776, after the American loss at the Battle of Long Island and the loss of [[Fort Washington (Manhattan)|Fort Washington]] on November 16.  Prisoners began to be housed on the broken-down warships and transports in December; about 24 ships were used in total, but generally only 5 or 6 at a time.  Almost twice as many Americans died from neglect in these ships than did from all the battles in the war: as many as 12,000 soldiers, sailors and civilians.  The bodies were thrown overboard or were buried in shallow graves on the riverbanks, but their bones \u2013 some of which were collected when they washed ashore \u2013 were later relocated and are now inside the [[Prison Ship Martyrs' Monument]] in nearby [[Fort Greene Park]].  The existence of the ships and the conditions the men were held in was widely known at the time through letters, diaries and memoirs, and was a factor not only in the attitude of Americans toward the British, but in the negotiations to formally end the war.<ref name=prison>[[Edwin G. Burrows|Burrows, Edwin G.]] \"prison ships\" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.1039\u201340</ref>\n\n===Development begins again===\nAfter the war, East River waterfront development continued once more. New York State legislation which in 1807 authorized what would become the [[Commissioners Plan of 1811]] also authorized the creation of new land out to 400 feet from the low water mark into the river, and with the advent of gridded streets along the new waterline \u2013 Joseph Mangin had laid out such a grid in 1803 in his ''A Plan and Regulation of the City of New York'', which was rejected by the city, but established the concept \u2013 the coastline become regularized at the same time that the strait became even narrower.<ref>Steinberg, pp.57\u201358; 73</ref>\n\nOne result of the narrowing of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklyn \u2013 which continued until the mid-19th century when the state put a stop to it \u2013 was an increase in the speed of its current. [[Buttermilk Channel]], the strait that divides [[Governors Island]] from [[Red Hook, Brooklyn|Red Hook]] in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the \"mouth\" of the East River, was in the early 17th century a fordable waterway across which cattle could be driven.  Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep ({{convert|18|feet}}), five fathoms deep ({{convert|30|feet}}) in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms ({{convert|42|feet}}) at low tide.  What had been almost a bridge between two landforms which were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn.<ref>Steinberg, pp.81\u201382, 89\u201390, 107</ref>  The continued narrowing of the channel on both side may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered byselling the newly made land.<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.719</ref>  Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell's Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.<ref name=unbound127>Steinberg, p.127</ref>\n\n[[File:New York and Vicinity as Proposed to be Remodeled crop.png|thumb|right|375px|James E. Serrell's plan for an expanded Manhattan and a straightened East River]]\n\n===Filling in the river===\nFilling in part of the river was also proposed in 1867 by engineer James E. Serrell, later a city surveyor, but with emphasis on solving the problem of Hell Gate. Serrell proposed filling in Hell Gate and build a \"New East River\" through Queens with an extension to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]].<ref name=unbound127/><ref>[[New York Public Library]] (1901) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MpZJAAAAYAAJ&dq=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22&f=false ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library''] p.109 Quote: \"Plan and description proposing to re model the city of New York and its vicinity By making a New East River filling up Hell Gate and annexing Brooklyn also extending into Westchester County By James E Serrell ... 1869\"</ref><ref>[[New York Public Library]] (1913) [https://books.google.com/books?id=_IYZAAAAMAAJ&dq=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22&pg=PA7#v=onepage&q=%22James%20E.%20Serrell%22%20%22East%20River%22&f=false ''Selected List of References Bearing on the City Plan of New York''] p.7 Quote: \"Suggestion for removal of rocks in Hell Gate to lessen currents Also to change shape of the boundary on the easterly and westerly side of New York Eleven reasons presented for furtherance of plan. ...

The New East River through Queens would be about three times the average width of the existing one at an even {{convert|3600|ft|m}} throughout, and would run as straight as an arrow for five miles.  The new land, and the portions of Queens which would become part of Manhattan, adding {{convert|2500|acre|ha}}, would be covered with an extension of the existing street grid of Manhattan.<ref>Koeppel (2015), pp.202\u201304</ref>\n\nVariations on Serrell's plan would be floated over the years.  A pseudonymous \"Terra Firma\" brought up filling in the East River again in the ''Evening Post'' and ''[[Scientific American]]'' in 1904, and [[Thomas Alva Edison]] took it up in 1906.  Then Thomas Kennard Thompson, a bridge and railway engineer, proposed in 1913 to fill in the river from Hell Gate to the tip of Manhattan and, as Serrell had suggested, make a new canalized East River, only this time from [[Flushing Bay]] to [[Jamaica Bay]]. He would also expand Brooklyn into the Upper Harbor, put up a dam from Brooklyn to [[Staten Island]], and make extensive landfill in the Lower Bay.  At around the same time, in the 1920s, Dr. John A. Harriss, New York City's chief traffic engineer, who had developed the first traffic signals in the city, also had plans for the river.  Harriss wanted to dam the East River at Hell Gate and the Williamsburg Bridge, then remove the water, put a roof over it on stilts, and build boulevards and pedestrian lanes on the roof along with \"majestic structures\", with transportation services below.  The East River's course would, once again, be shifted to run through Queens, and this time Brooklyn as well, to channel it to the Harbor.<ref>Koeppel (2015), pp.221\u2013226</ref>\n\n===Clearing Hell Gate===\n{{main|Removal of Hell Gate rocks}}\n\nPeriodically, merchants and other interested parties would try to get something done about the difficulty of navigating through Hell Gate. In 1832, the New York State legislature was presented with a petition for a canal to be built through nearby Hallet's Point, thus avoiding Hell Gate altogether.  Instead, the legislature responded by providing ships with pilots trained to navigate the shoals for the next 15 years.<ref name=concrete93>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.93</ref>\n\nIn 1849, a French engineer whose specialty was underwater blasting, [[Benjamin Maillefert]], had cleared some of the rocks which, along with the mix of tides, made the Hell Gate stretch of the river so dangerous to navigate.  Ebenezer Meriam had organized a subscription to pay Maillefert $6,000 to, for instance, reduce \"Pot Rock\" to provide {{convert|24|ft}} of depth at low-mean water.  While ships continued to run aground (in the 1850s about 2% of ships did so) and petitions continued to call for action, the federal government undertook surveys of the area which ended in 1851 with a detailed and accurate map.<ref name=concrete93 />  By then Maillefert had cleared the rock \"Baldheaded Billy\", and it was reported that Pot Rock had been reduced to {{convert|20.5|ft}}, which encouraged the [[United States Congress]] to appropriate $20,000 for further clearing of the strait.  However, a more accurate survey showed that the depth of Pot Rock was actually a little more than {{convert|18|ft}}, and eventually Congress withdrew its funding.<ref>Steinberg, pp.99\u2013100</ref>\n\n[[File:PSM V28 D454 Hallet point excavations and tunnel 7.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The excavations and tunnels used to undermine Hallert's Point]]\n\nWith the main shipping channels through The Narrows into the harbor silting up with sand due to [[littoral drift]], thus providing ships with less depth, and a new generation of larger ships coming online \u2013 epitomized by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]]'s [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], popularly known as \"Leviathan\" \u2013 New York began to be concerned that it would start to lose its status as a great port if a \"back door\" entrance into the harbor was not created.<ref>Steinberg, pp.105\u2013106</ref>  In the 1850s the depth continued to lessen \u2013 the harbor commission said in 1850 that the mean water low was {{convert|24|ft}} and the extreme water low was {{convert|23|ft}} \u2013 while the draft required by the new ships continued to increase, meaning it was only safe for them to enter the harbor at high tide.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.94\u201395</ref>\n\nThe U.S. Congress, realizing that the problem needed to be addressed, appropriated $20,000 for the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Army Corps of Engineers]] to continue Maillefert's work, but the money was soon spent without appreciable change in the hazards of navigating the strait.  An advisory council recommended in 1856 that the strait be cleared of all obstacles, but nothing was done, and the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] soon broke out.<ref name=concrete95>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.95</ref>\n\nIn the late 1860s, after the Civil War, Congress realized the military importance of having easily navigable waterways, and charged the Army Corps of Engineers with clearing Hell Gate of the rocks there that caused a danger to navigation. The Corps' Colonel James Newton estimated that the project would cost $1 million, as compared to the approximate annual loss in shipping of $2 million.  Initial forays floundered, and Newton, by that time a general, took over direct control of the project.<ref name=concrete95 />  In 1868 Newton decided, with the support of both New York's mercantile class and local real estate interests, to focus on the {{convert|3|acre|ha|adj=on}} Hallert's Point Reef off of Queens.  The project would involve {{convert| 7,000|ft}} of tunnels equipped with trains to haul debris out as the reef was eviscerated, creating a reef structured like \"swiss cheese\" which Newton would then blow up.  After seven years of digging seven thousand holes, and filling four thousand of them with {{convert|30000|lb}} of dynamite, on September 24, 1876, in front of an audience of people including the inhabitants of the insane asylum on Wards Island, but not the prisoners of Roosevelt Island \u2013 then called Blackwell's Island \u2013 who remained in their cells, Newton's daughter set off the explosion. The effect was immediate in decreased turbulence through the strait, and fewer accidents and shipwrecks.  The city's [[Chamber of Commerce]] commented that \"The Centennial year will be for ever known in the annals of commerce for this destruction of one of the terrors of navigation.\"  Clearing out the debris from the explosion took until 1891.<ref name=fed420 /><ref name=wolfe /><ref name=\"Steinberg, pp.139, 142-43\">Steinberg, pp.139, 142\u201343</ref><ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.95\u201396</ref>\n\nThen, in 1885, Flood Rock, a {{convert|9|acre|ha|adj=on}} reef that Newton had begun to undermine even before starting on Hallert's Rock, removing {{convert|8,000|cuyd}} of rock from the reef, was blown up as well, with Civil War General [[Philip Sheridan]] and abolitionist [[Henry Ward Beecher]] among those in attendance, and Newton's daughter once more setting off the blast, the biggest ever to that date, and reportedly the largest man-made explosion until the advent of the [[atomic bomb]]<ref name=fed420 /><ref name=wolfe /><ref name=\"Steinberg, pp.139, 142-43\"/><ref name=Whitt>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE3D71631F931A35755C0A9609C8B63 |title=The East River is Cleaner Now.

Two years later, plans were in place to dredge Hell Gate to a consistent depth of {{convert|26|ft}}.<ref name=concrete96>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.96</ref>\n\nAt the same time that Hell Gate was being cleared, the [[Harlem River Ship Canal]] was being planned.  When it was completed in 1895, the \"back door\" to New York's center of ship-borne trade in the docks and warehouses of the East River was open from two directions, through the cleared East River, and from the Hudson River through the [[Harlem River]] to the East River.<ref>Steinberg, p.140</ref> Ironically, though, while both forks of the northern shipping entrance to the city were now open, modern dredging techniques had cut through the sandbars of the Atlantic Ocean entrance, allowing new, even larger ships to use that traditional passage into New York's docks.<ref name=concrete96 />\n\nAt the beginning of the 19th century, the East River was the center of New York's shipping industry, but by the end of the century, much of it had moved to the Hudson River, leaving the East River wharves and slips to begin a long process of decay, until the area was finally rehabilitated in the mid-1960s, and the [[South Street Seaport Museum]] was opened in 1967.<ref>{{cite naming|page=34}}</ref>\n\n===A new seawall===\nBy 1870, the condition of the Port of New York along both the East and Hudson Rivers had so deteriorated that the New York State legislature created the Department of Docks to renovate the port and keep New York competitive with other ports on the American East Coast.  The Department of Docks was given the task of creating the master plan for the waterfront, and General [[George B. McClellan]] was engaged to head the project.  McClellan held public hearings and invited plans to be submitted, ultimately receiving 70 of them, although in the end he and his successors put his own plan into effect.  That plan called for the building of a seawall around Manhattan island from [[61st Street (Manhattan)|West 61st Street]] on the Hudson, around [[The Battery (Manhattan)|The Battery]], and up to [[51st Street (Manhattan)|East 51st Street]] on the East River.  The area behind the masonry wall (mostly concrete but in some parts granite blocks) would be filled in with landfill, and wide streets would be laid down on the new land.  In this way, a new edge for the island (or at least the part of it used as a commercial port) would be created.<ref name=concrete184>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.184\u2013186</ref>\n\nThe Department had surveyed {{convert|13,700|ft}} of shoreline by 1878, as well as documenting the currents and tides. By 1900, {{convert|75|mi}} had been surveyed and core samples had been taken to inform the builders of how deep the bedrock was. The work was completed just as [[World War I]] began, allowing the Port of New York to be a major point of embarkation for troops and materiel.<ref name=concrete184 />\n\nThe new seawall helps protect Manhattan island from storm surges, although it is only {{convert|5|ft}} above the mean sea level, so that particularly dangerous storms, such as the [[nor'easter]] of 1992 and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012, which hit the city in a way to create surges which are much higher, can still do significant damage. (The Hurricane of September 3, 1831 created the biggest storm surge on record in New York City: a rise of {{convert|13|ft}} in one hour at the Battery, flooding all of lower Manhattan up to [[Canal Street (Manhattan)|Canal Street]].)  Still, the new seawall begun in 1871 gave the island a firmer edge, improved the quality of the port, and continues to protect Manhattan from normal storm surges.<ref name=concrete184 />\n\n===Bridges and tunnels===\n{{see also|#Crossings}}\nThe [[Brooklyn Bridge]], completed in 1883, was the first bridge to span the East River, connecting the cities of New York and [[Brooklyn]], and all but replacing the frequent ferry service between them, which did not return until the late 20th century.  The bridge offered [[cable car]] service across the span.  The Brooklyn Bridge was followed by the [[Williamsburg Bridge]] (1903), the [[Queensboro Bridge]] (1909), the [[Manhattan Bridge]] (1912) and the [[Hell Gate Bridge|Hell Gate Railroad Bridge]] (1916). Later would come the [[Triborough Bridge]] (1936), the [[Bronx-Whitestone Bridge]] (1939), the [[Throgs Neck Bridge]] (1961) and the [[Rikers Island|Rikers Island Bridge]] (1966).  In addition, numerous rail tunnels pass under the East River \u2013 most of them part of the [[New York City Subway]] system \u2013 as does the [[Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel]] and the [[Queens-Midtown Tunnel]]. (See [[#Crossings|Crossings]] below for details.)  Also under the river is Water Tunnel #1 of the [[New York City water supply system]], built in 1917 to extend the Manhattan portion of the tunnel to Brooklyn, and via City Tunnel #2 (1936) to Queens; these boroughs became part of New York City after the city's consolidation in 1898.<ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.1229</ref><ref name=\"water\">[[New York City Department of Environmental Protection]] [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dep/html/dep_projects/cp_city_water_tunnel3.shtml \"City Water Tunnel #3\"]</ref> City Tunnel #3 will also run under the river, under the northern tip of Roosevelt Island, and is expected to be completed by 2018; the Manhattan portion of the tunnel went into service in 2013.<ref name=water />\n\n===20th and 21st centuries===\nPhilanthropist [[John D. Rockefeller]] founded what is now [[Rockefeller University]] in 1901, between [[63rd Street (Manhattan)|63rd]] and [[64th Street (Manhattan)|64th]] Streets on the river side of [[York Avenue (Manhattan)|York Avenue]], overlooking the river.  The university is a research university for doctoral and post-doctoral scholars, primarily in the fields of medicine and biological science.  North of it is one of the major medical centers in the city, [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital|NewYork Presbyterian / Weill Cornell Medical Center]], which is associated with the medical schools of both [[Columbia University]] and [[Cornell University]].  Although it can trace its history back to 1771, the center on York Avenue, much of which overlooks the river, was built in 1932.<ref>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), pp.89\u201390</ref>\n\n[[File:General slocum burning.jpg|thumb|325px|right|Firefighters working to put out the fire on the listing ''General Slocum'']]\n\nThe East River was the site of one of the greatest disasters in the history of New York City when, in June 1904, the [[PS General Slocum|PS ''General Slocum'']] sank near North Brother Island due to a fire.

The road in sometimes at grade, sometimes runs under locations such as the site of the [[Headquarters of the United Nations]] and [[Carl Schurz Park]] and [[Gracie Mansion]] \u2013 the mayor's official residence, and is at time double-decked, because Hell Gate provides no room for more landfill.<ref name=concrete90>Eldredge & Horenstein (2014), p.90</ref> It begins at [[The Battery (Manhattan)|Battery Park]], runs past the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg and Queensboro Bridges, and the Ward's Island Footbridge, and terminates just before the Robert F.

The sewers terminated at the slips where ships docked, until the waste began to build up, preventing dockage, after which the outfalls were moved to the end of the piers.  The \"landfill\" which created new land along the shoreline when the river was \"wharfed out\" by the sale of \"water lots\" was largely garbage such as bones, offal, and even whole dead animals, along with excrement \u2013 human and animal.<ref>Steinberg, 23\u201328, ''passim''</ref><ref>Burrows and Wallace, p.185</ref>  The result was that by the 1850s, if not before, the East River, like the other waterways around the city, was undergoing the process of [[eutrophication]] where the increase in [[nitrogen]] from excrement and other sources led to a decrease in free [[oxygen]], which in turn led to an increase in [[phytoplankton]] such as [[algae]] and a decrease in other life forms, breaking the area's established food chain. The East River became very polluted, and its animal life decreased drastically.<ref>Steinberg, pp.118\u201319</ref>\n\nIn an earlier time, one person had described the transparency of the water: \"I remember the time, gentlemen, when you could go in twelve feet of water and you could see the pebbles on the bottom of this river.\"  As the water got more polluted, it darkened, underwater vegetation (such as [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizing]] [[seagrass]]) began dying, and as the seagrass beds declined, the many associated species of their ecosystems declined as well, contributing to the decline of the river. Also harmful was the general destruction of the once plentiful [[oyster bed]]s in the waters around the city,<ref group=notes>Oysters were so plentiful in New Amsterdam and early New York that they were considered to be food for the poor, although the rich also ate them in great numbers. They were sold in specialized \"oyster shops\" and by vendors on the street, some of which were paved with their shells. Pearl Street was named after the piles of oysters left there by the Native Americans of the area. \"Enjoy the oysters\" was often said to a person planning on traveling to New York City, so strong was the bivalve as an icon of the city. It was only after the collapse of the local oyster beds, by around 1920, that oysters became scarce, and a delicacy only affordable by the rich.{{parabr}}{{nb5}}Burrows and Wallace, pp.460, 798, 816<br>{{nb5}}Kurlansky, Mark \"oysters\" in {{cite enc-nyc2}}, pp.963\u2013964<br>{{nb5}}Steinberg, pp.7, 170\u201371</ref> and the over-fishing of [[menhaden]], or [[mossbunker]], a small silvery fish which had been used since the time of the Native Americans for fertilizing crops \u2013 however it took 8,000 of these schooling fish to fertilize a single acre, so mechanized fishing using the [[purse seine]] was developed, and eventually the menhaden population collapsed.  Menhaden feed on phytoplankton, helping to keep them in check, and are also a vital step in the food chain, as [[bluefish]], [[striped bass]] and other fish species which do not eat phytoplankton feed on the menhaden.  The oyster is another filter feeder: oysters purify 10 to 100 gallons a day, while each menhaden filters four gallons in a minute, and their schools were immense: one report had a farmer collecting 20 oxcarts worth of menhaden using simple fishing nets deployed from the shore.  The combination of more sewage, due to the availability of more potable water \u2013 New York's water consumption ''per capita'' was twice that of Europe \u2013 indoor plumbing, the destruction of filter feeders, and the collapse of the food chain, damaged the ecosystem of the waters around New York, including the East River, almost beyond repair.<ref>Steinberg, pp.166\u201373</ref>\n\nBecause of these changes to the ecosystem, by 1909, the level of dissolved-oxygen in the lower part of the river had declined to less than 65%, where 55% of saturation is the point at which the amount of fish and the number of their species begins to be affected.<ref>Steinberg, pp.161, 163\u201364</ref> Only 17 years later, by 1926, the level of dissolved oxygen in the river had fallen to 13%, below the point at which most fish species can survive.<ref>Steinberg, p.177</ref>\n\n<!--The following information, right up to the 8/30/07 NY Times footnote, is covered by the source in that footnote.

The lecture was published as ''[[L'existentialisme est un humanisme]]'' (''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]''), a short book that did much to popularize existentialist thought.<ref>''L'Existentialisme est un Humanisme'' (Editions Nagel, 1946); ''English'' Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Existentialism and Humanism'' (Eyre Methuen, 1948)</ref> Marcel later came to reject the label himself in favour of the term Neo-Socratic, in honor of Kierkegaard's essay \"On The Concept of Irony\".\n\nSome scholars argue that the term should be used only to refer to the cultural movement in Europe in the 1940s and 1950s associated with the works of the philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], and [[Albert Camus]].<ref name=\"Crowell-SEoP\"/> Other scholars extend the term to Kierkegaard, and yet others extend it as far back as [[Socrates]].<ref>Crowell, Steven. ''The Cambridge Companion to Existentialism'', Cambridge, 2011, p. 316.</ref> However, the term is often identified with the philosophical views of Jean-Paul Sartre.<ref name=\"Crowell-SEoP\"/>\n\n==Definitional issues and background==\nThe labels ''existentialism'' and ''existentialist'' are often seen as historical conveniences in as far as they were first applied to many philosophers in hindsight, long after they had died. In fact, while existentialism is generally considered to have originated with Kierkegaard, the first prominent existentialist philosopher to adopt the term as a self-description was [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Sartre posits the idea that \"what all existentialists have in common is the fundamental doctrine that [[existence precedes essence]]\", as scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] explains.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Existentialism | journal = Philosophy | first = F.C. | last = Copleston | volume = 23 | issue = 84 | pages = 19\u201337 | jstor = 4544850 | doi = 10.1017/S0031819100065955 | year = 2009}}</ref> According to philosopher [[Steven Crowell]], defining existentialism has been relatively difficult, and he argues that it is better [[understanding|understood]] as a general approach used to reject certain systematic philosophies rather than as a systematic philosophy itself.<ref name=\"Crowell-SEoP\"/> Sartre himself, in a lecture delivered in 1945, described existentialism as \"the attempt to draw all the consequences from a position of consistent [[atheism]]\".<ref>See [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]]'s introduction to {{Cite book |last = Sartre |first = Jean-Paul |year = 2000 |title = Nausea |location = London |publisher = [[Penguin Classics]] |isbn = 978-0-141-18549-1 }} Quote on p.&nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CGbBbtDOZbwC&pg=PT5 vii].</ref>\n\nAlthough many outside [[Scandinavia]] consider the term existentialism to have originated from Kierkegaard himself{{who|date=May 2018}}, it is more likely that Kierkegaard adopted this term (or at least the term \"existential\" as a description of his philosophy) from the Norwegian poet and literary critic [[Johan Sebastian Cammermeyer Welhaven]].<ref>Tidsskrift for Norsk Psykologforening, Vol 45, nummer 10, 2008, side 1298\u20131304, [http://www.psykologtidsskriftet.no/index.php?seks_id=61613&a=2 Welhaven og psykologien: Del 2. Welhaven peker fremover] (in Norwegian)</ref> This assertion comes from two sources. The Norwegian philosopher Erik Lundestad refers to the Danish philosopher Fredrik Christian Sibbern. Sibbern is supposed to have had two conversations in 1841, the first with Welhaven and the second with Kierkegaard. It is in the first conversation that it is believed that Welhaven came up with \"a word that he said covered a certain thinking, which had a close and positive attitude to life, a relationship he described as existential\".<ref>Lundestad, 1998, p. 169</ref> This was then brought to Kierkegaard by Sibbern.\n\nThe second claim comes from the Norwegian historian [[Rune Slagstad]], who claims to prove that Kierkegaard himself said the term \"existential\" was borrowed from the poet. He strongly believes that it was Kierkegaard himself who said that \"[[Hegelianism|Hegelians]] do not study philosophy 'existentially'; to use a phrase by Welhaven from one time when I spoke with him about philosophy\".<ref>Slagstad, 2001, p. 89</ref>\n\n== Concepts ==\n\n=== Existence precedes essence ===\n{{Main article|Existence precedes essence}}\n\nSartre claimed that a central proposition of Existentialism is that ''existence precedes [[essence]]'', which means that the most important consideration for individuals is that they are individuals\u2014independently acting and responsible, conscious beings (\"existence\")\u2014rather than what labels, roles, stereotypes, definitions, or other preconceived categories the individuals fit (\"essence\"). The actual life of the individuals is what constitutes what could be called their \"true essence\" instead of there being an arbitrarily attributed essence others use to define them. Thus, human beings, through their own [[consciousness]], create their own values and determine a meaning to their life.<ref>{{fr icon}} (Dictionary) \"L'existencialisme\" \u2013 see \"l'identit\u00e9 de la personne\"</ref> Although it was Sartre who explicitly coined the phrase, similar notions can be found in the thought of existentialist philosophers such as [[Heidegger]], and [[Kierkegaard]]:\n\n{{Quotation|\"The subjective ''thinker\u2019s form'', the form of his communication, is his ''style''. His form must be just as manifold as are the opposites that he holds together. The systematic ''eins, zwei, drei'' is an abstract form that also must inevitably run into trouble whenever it is to be applied to the concrete. To the same degree as the subjective thinker is concrete, to the same degree his form must also be concretely dialectical. But just as he himself is not a poet, not an ethicist, not a dialectician, so also his form is none of these directly. His form must first and last be related to existence, and in this regard he must have at his disposal the poetic, the ethical, the dialectical, the religious. Subordinate character, setting, etc., which belong to the well-balanced character of the esthetic production, are in themselves breadth; the subjective thinker has only one setting\u2014existence\u2014and has nothing to do with localities and such things. The setting is not the fairyland of the imagination, where poetry produces consummation, nor is the setting laid in England, and historical accuracy is not a concern. The setting is inwardness in existing as a human being; the concretion is the relation of the existence-categories to one another. Historical accuracy and historical actuality are breadth.\" S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (Concluding Postscript, Hong pp. 357\u201358)}}\n\nSome interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence - what Sartre would call '[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]'. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are (1) defined only insofar as they act and (2) that they are responsible for their actions. For example, someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Furthermore, by this action of cruelty, such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is as opposed to their genes, or ''human nature'', bearing the blame.\n\nAs Sartre says in his lecture ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'': \"... man first of all exists, encounters himself, surges up in the world\u2014and defines himself afterwards\". The more positive, therapeutic aspect of this is also implied: A person can choose to act in a different way, and to be a good person instead of a cruel person.<ref>{{cite book |last=Baird |first=Forrest E. |authorlink= |author2=Walter Kaufmann |title=From Plato to Derrida |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |year=2008 |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |pages= |url= |doi= |isbn=0-13-158591-6}}</ref>\n\nSartre's definition of existentialism was based on Heidegger's magnum opus \"Being and Time\". In a set of letters, Heidegger implies that Sartre misunderstood him for his own purposes of subjectivism, and that he did not mean that actions take precedence over being so long as those actions were not reflected upon. This way of living, Heidegger called \"average everydayness\".\n\n=== The Absurd ===\n{{Main article|Absurdism}}\n\nThe notion of the [[Absurdism|Absurd]] contains the idea that there is no meaning in the world beyond what meaning we give it. This meaninglessness also encompasses the amorality or \"unfairness\" of the world. This conceptualization can be highlighted in the way it opposes the traditional [[Abrahamic religions|Judeo-Christian-Islamic]] perspective, which establishes that life's purpose is about the fulfillment of God's commandments.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Existentialism: A Beginner's Guide|last=Wartenberg|first=Thomas|publisher=One World|year=2008|isbn=9781780740201|location=Oxford|pages=}}</ref> Such a purpose is what gives meaning to people's lives. To live the life of the absurd means rejecting a life that finds or pursues specific meaning for man's existence since there is nothing to be discovered. According to Albert Camus, the world or the human being is not in itself absurd. The concept only emerges through the [[juxtaposition]] of the two, where life becomes absurd due to the incompatibility between human beings and the world they inhabit.<ref name=\":0\" />  This view constitutes one of the two interpretations of the absurd in existentialist literature. The second view, which was first elaborated by  [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], holds that absurdity is limited to actions and choices of human beings. These are considered absurd since they issue from human freedom, undermining their foundation outside of themselves.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The A to Z of Existentialism|last=Michelman|first=Stephen|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=9780810875890|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=27}}</ref>\n\nThe notion of the absurd in existentialism  contrasts with the claim that \"bad things don't happen to good people\"; to the world, metaphorically speaking, there is no such thing as a good person or a bad person; what happens happens, and it may just as well happen to a \"good\" person as to a \"bad\" person.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#AnxNotAbs 3.1 Anxiety, Nothingness, the Absurd]</ref> Because of the world's absurdity, at any point in time, anything can happen to anyone, and a tragic event could plummet someone into direct confrontation with the Absurd.

Although \"prescriptions\" against the possibly deleterious consequences of these kinds of encounters vary, from Kierkegaard's religious \"stage\" to Camus' insistence on persevering in spite of absurdity, the concern with helping people avoid living their lives in ways that put them in the perpetual danger of having everything meaningful break down is common to most existentialist philosophers. The possibility of having everything meaningful break down poses a threat of [[Quietism (philosophy)|quietism]], which is inherently against the existentialist philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean-Paul Sartre |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm |title=Existentialism is a Humanism, Jean-Paul Sartre 1946 |publisher=Marxists.org |accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref> It has been said that the possibility of [[suicide]] makes all humans existentialists.

Either remove it; or change its value to \".\" for the cite to end in a \".\", as necessary. -->}}</ref>\n\n=== Facticity ===\n{{main article|Facticity}}\n\nFacticity is a concept defined by Sartre in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' as the ''[[being-in-itself|in-itself]]'', which delineates for humans the modalities of being and not being. This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, in the sense that it co-constitutes oneself. However, to say that one is only one's past would be to ignore a significant part of reality (the present and the future), while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from oneself now. A denial of one's own concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and the same goes for all other kinds of facticity (having a human body \u2014 e.g., one that doesn't allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound \u2014 identity, values, etc.).<ref name=\"2.1 Facticity and Transcendence\">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FacTra 2.1 Facticity and Transcendence]</ref>\n\nFacticity is both a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one couldn't have chosen (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it. However, even though one's facticity is \"set in stone\" (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: The value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. They both have committed many crimes, but the first man, knowing nothing about this, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for \"trapping\" him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.\n\nHowever, to disregard one's facticity when, in the continual process of self-making, one projects oneself into the future, that would be to put oneself in denial of oneself, and thus would be inauthentic. In other words, the origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially). An example of one focusing solely on one's possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity:<ref name=\"2.1 Facticity and Transcendence\"/> if one continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without considering the facticity of ''not currently having the financial means to do so''. In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a ''future-facticity'' of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.\n\nAnother aspect of facticity is that it entails [[angst]], both in the sense that freedom \"produces\" angst when limited by facticity, and in the sense that the lack of the possibility of having facticity to \"step in\" for one to take responsibility for something one has done, also produces angst.\n\nAnother aspect of existential freedom is that one can change one's values.  Thus, one is responsible for one's values, regardless of society's values.  The focus on [[freedom]] in existentialism is related to the limits of the responsibility one bears, as a result of one's freedom: the relationship between freedom and responsibility is one of interdependency, and a clarification of freedom also clarifies that for which one is responsible.<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#FreVal 3. Freedom and Value]</ref><ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#IdeVal 3.2 The Ideality of Values]</ref>\n\n=== Authenticity ===\n{{main article|Authenticity (philosophy)|l1=Authenticity}}\n\nMany noted existentialist writers consider the theme of authentic existence important. Authentic existence involves the idea that one has to \"create oneself\" and then live in accordance with this self. What is meant by [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]] is that in acting, one should act as oneself, not as \"one's acts\" or as \"one's genes\" or any other essence requires. The authentic act is one that is in accordance with one's freedom. As a condition of freedom is facticity, this includes one's facticity, but not to the degree that this facticity can in any way determine one's transcendent choices (in the sense that one could then blame one's background [facticity] for making the choice one made [chosen project, from one's transcendence]). The role of facticity in relation to authenticity involves letting one's actual values come into play when one makes a choice (instead of, like Kierkegaard's Aesthete, \"choosing\" randomly), so that one also takes responsibility for the act instead of choosing either-or without allowing the options to have different values.<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Aut 2.3 Authenticity]</ref>\n\nIn contrast to this, the inauthentic is the denial to live in accordance with one's freedom. This can take many forms, from pretending choices are meaningless or random, through convincing oneself that some form of [[determinism]] is true, to a sort of \"mimicry\" where one acts as \"one should\".\n\nHow \"one should\" act is often determined by an image one has, of how one such as oneself (say, a bank manager, lion tamer, prostitute, etc.) acts. In [[Being and Nothingness]], Sartre relates an example of a \"[[waiter]]\" in ''bad faith'': he merely takes part in the \"act\" of being a typical waiter, albeit very convincingly.<ref name=\"Jean-Paul Sartre 2003\">Jean-Paul Sartre, ''Being and Nothingness'', Routledge Classics (2003).</ref> This image usually corresponds to some sort of social norm, but this does not mean that all acting in accordance with social norms is inauthentic: The main point is the attitude one takes to one's own freedom and responsibility, and the extent to which one acts in accordance with this freedom.\n\n=== The Other and the Look ===\n{{main article|Other (philosophy)}}\n\nThe Other (when written with a capital \"O\") is a concept more properly belonging to [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and its account of [[intersubjectivity]]. However, the concept has seen widespread use in existentialist writings, and the conclusions drawn from it differ slightly from the phenomenological accounts. The experience of the Other is the experience of another free subject who inhabits the same world as a person does. In its most basic form, it is this experience of the Other that constitutes intersubjectivity and objectivity. To clarify, when one experiences someone else, and this Other person experiences the world (the same world that a person experiences)\u2014only from \"over there\"\u2014the world itself is constituted as objective in that it is something that is \"there\" as identical for both of the subjects; a person experiences the other person as experiencing the same things. This experience of the Other's look is what is termed the Look (sometimes [[the Gaze]]).<ref>Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Existentialism, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/#Ali 2.2 Alienation]</ref>\n\nWhile this experience, in its basic phenomenological sense, constitutes the world as objective, and oneself as objectively existing subjectivity (one experiences oneself as seen in the Other's Look in precisely the same way that one experiences the Other as seen by him, as subjectivity), in existentialism, it also acts as a kind of limitation of freedom. This is because the Look tends to objectify what it sees. As such, when one experiences oneself in the Look, one doesn't experience oneself as nothing (no thing), but as something. Sartre's own example of a man peeping at someone through a keyhole can help clarify this: at first, this man is entirely caught up in the situation he is in; he is in a pre-reflexive state where his entire consciousness is directed at what goes on in the room. Suddenly, he hears a creaking floorboard behind him, and he becomes aware of himself as seen by the Other. He is thus filled with shame for he perceives himself as he would perceive someone else doing what he was doing, as a [[Peeping Tom]]. The Look is then co-constitutive of one's facticity.\n\nAnother characteristic feature of the Look is that no Other really needs to have been there: It is quite possible that the creaking floorboard was nothing but the movement of an old house; the Look isn't some kind of mystical telepathic experience of the actual way the other sees one (there may also have been someone there, but he could have not noticed that the person was there). It is only one's perception of the way another might perceive him.\n\n=== Angst and dread ===\n{{main article|Angst}}\n{{See also|Living educational theory}}\n\n\"Existential [[angst]]\", sometimes called existential dread, anxiety, or [[anguish]], is a term that is common to many existentialist thinkers. It is generally held to be a negative feeling arising from the experience of human freedom and responsibility. The archetypical example is the experience one has when standing on a cliff where one not only fears falling off it, but also dreads the possibility of throwing oneself off. In this experience that \"nothing is holding me back\", one senses the lack of anything that predetermines one to either throw oneself off or to stand still, and one experiences one's own freedom. Angst, according to the modern existentialist, [[Adam Fong]], is the sudden realization of a lack of meaning, often while one completes a task that initially seems to have intrinsic meaning.<ref name=\"plato.stanford.edu\"/>\n\nIt can also be seen in relation to the previous point how angst is before nothing, and this is what sets it apart from fear that has an object. While in the case of fear, one can take definitive measures to remove the object of fear, in the case of angst, no such \"constructive\" measures are possible. The use of the word \"nothing\" in this context relates both to the inherent insecurity about the consequences of one's actions, and to the fact that, in experiencing freedom as angst, one also realizes that one is fully responsible for these consequences. There is nothing in people (genetically, for instance) that acts in their stead\u2014that they can blame if something goes wrong. Therefore, not every choice is perceived as having dreadful possible consequences (and, it can be claimed, human lives would be unbearable if every choice facilitated dread). However, this doesn't change the fact that freedom remains a condition of every action.\n\n=== Despair ===\n{{Main article|Philosophy of S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard#Despair|l1=Despair}}\n{{See also|Existential crisis}}\n\nDespair, in existentialism, is generally defined as a loss of hope.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/despair |title=despair - definition of despair by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia |publisher=Tfd.com |accessdate=2010-03-08}}</ref> More specifically, it is a loss of hope in reaction to a breakdown in one or more of the defining qualities of one's self or identity. If a person is invested in being a particular thing, such as a bus driver or an upstanding citizen, and then finds their being-thing compromised, they would normally be found in a state of despair\u2014a hopeless state. For example, a singer who loses the ability to sing may despair if they have nothing else to fall back on\u2014nothing to rely on for their identity. They find themselves unable to be what defined their being.\n\nWhat sets the existentialist notion of despair apart from the conventional definition is that existentialist despair is a state one is in even when they aren't overtly in despair. So long as a person's identity depends on qualities that can crumble, they are in perpetual despair\u2014and as there is, in Sartrean terms, no human essence found in conventional reality on which to constitute the individual's sense of identity, despair is a universal human condition. As Kierkegaard defines it in ''[[Either/Or]]'': \"Let each one learn what he can; both of us can learn that a person\u2019s unhappiness never lies in his lack of control over external conditions, since this would only make him completely unhappy.\"<ref>Either/Or Part II p. 188 Hong</ref> In ''[[Works of Love]]'', he said: {{Quotation|When the God-forsaken worldliness of earthly life shuts itself in complacency, the confined air develops poison, the moment gets stuck and stands still, the prospect is lost, a need is felt for a refreshing, enlivening breeze to cleanse the air and dispel the poisonous vapors lest we suffocate in worldliness. ... Lovingly to hope all things is the opposite of despairingly to hope [[nothing]] at all. Love hopes all things\u2014yet is never put to shame. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of the good is to hope. To relate oneself expectantly to the possibility of evil is to fear. By the decision to choose hope one decides infinitely more than it seems, because it is an eternal decision. pp. 246\u201350}}\n\n==Opposition to positivism and rationalism==\n{{See also|Positivism|Rationalism}}\n\nExistentialists oppose definitions of human beings as primarily rational, and, therefore, oppose [[positivism]] and [[rationalism]]. Existentialism asserts that people actually make decisions based on subjective meaning rather than pure rationality. The rejection of reason as the source of meaning is a common theme of existentialist thought, as is the focus on the feelings of [[anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]] that we feel in the face of our own radical [[free will|freedom]] and our awareness of death. Kierkegaard advocated rationality as a means to interact with the objective world (e.g., in the natural sciences), but when it comes to existential problems, reason is insufficient: \"Human reason has boundaries\".<ref>''S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard's Journals and Papers'' Vol 5, p. 5</ref>\n\nLike Kierkegaard, Sartre saw problems with rationality, calling it a form of \"bad faith\", an attempt by the self to impose structure on a world of phenomena\u2014\"the Other\"\u2014that is fundamentally irrational and random. According to Sartre, rationality and other forms of bad faith hinder people from finding meaning in freedom. To try to suppress their feelings of anxiety and dread, people confine themselves within everyday experience, Sartre asserts, thereby relinquishing their freedom and acquiescing to being possessed in one form or another by \"the Look\" of \"the Other\" (i.e., possessed by another person\u2014or at least one's idea of that other person).\n\n== Religion ==\n{{See also|Atheistic existentialism|Christian existentialism|Jewish existentialism}}\n\nAn existentialist reading of the [[Bible]] would demand that the reader recognize that (s)he is an existing [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] studying the words more as a recollection of events. This is in contrast to looking at a collection of \"truths\" that are outside and unrelated to the reader, but may develop a sense of reality/God. Such a reader is not obligated to follow the commandments as if an external agent is forcing these commandments upon them, but as though they are inside them and guiding them from inside. This is the task Kierkegaard takes up when he asks: \"Who has the more difficult task: the teacher who lectures on earnest things a meteor's distance from everyday life - or the learner who should put it to use?\"<ref>Kierkegaard, Soren. ''Works of Love''. Harper & Row, Publishers. New York, N.Y. 1962. p. 62</ref>\n\n== Confusion with nihilism ==\n{{See also|Existential nihilism}}\n\nAlthough [[nihilism]] and existentialism are distinct philosophies, they are often confused with one another. A primary cause of confusion is that [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] is an important philosopher in both fields, but also the existentialist insistence on the inherent meaninglessness of the world. Existentialist philosophers often stress the importance of [[Angst]] as signifying the absolute lack of any objective ground for action, a move that is often reduced to a [[Moral nihilism|moral]] or an [[existential nihilism]]. A pervasive theme in the works of existentialist philosophy, however, is to persist through encounters with the absurd, as seen in [[Albert Camus|Camus]]' ''The Myth of Sisyphus'' (\"One must imagine Sisyphus happy\"),<ref>Camus, Albert. \"The Myth of Sisyphus\". [http://www.nyu.edu/classes/keefer/hell/camus.html NYU.edu]</ref> and it is only very rarely that existentialist philosophers dismiss morality or one's self-created meaning: Kierkegaard regained a sort of morality in the religious (although he wouldn't himself agree that it was ethical; the religious suspends the ethical), and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]'s final words in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' are \"All these questions, which refer us to a pure and not an accessory (or impure) reflection, can find their reply only on the ethical plane. We shall devote to them a future work.\"<ref name=\"Jean-Paul Sartre 2003\"/>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 19th century ===\n\n==== Kierkegaard and Nietzsche ====\n{{Main article|S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche}}\n\n[[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] were two of the first philosophers considered fundamental to the existentialist movement, though neither used the term \"existentialism\" and it is unclear whether they would have supported the existentialism of the 20th century. They focused on subjective human experience rather than the objective truths of mathematics and science, which they believed were too detached or observational to truly get at the human experience. Like [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]], they were interested in people's quiet struggle with the apparent meaninglessness of life and the use of diversion to escape from [[boredom]]. Unlike Pascal, Kierkegaard and Nietzsche also considered the role of making free choices, particularly regarding fundamental values and beliefs, and how such choices change the nature and identity of the chooser.<ref>Luper, Steven. \"Existing\". Mayfield Publishing, 2000, pp. 4\u20135 and 11</ref> Kierkegaard's [[knight of faith]] and Nietzsche's [[\u00dcbermensch]] are representative of people who exhibit [[Free will|Freedom]], in that they define the nature of their own existence. Nietzsche's idealized individual invents his own values and creates the very terms they excel under. By contrast, Kierkegaard, opposed to the level of abstraction in Hegel, and not nearly as hostile (actually welcoming) to [[Christianity]] as Nietzsche, argues through a pseudonym that the objective certainty of religious truths (specifically Christian) is not only impossible, but even founded on logical paradoxes. Yet he continues to imply that a [[leap of faith]] is a possible means for an individual to reach a higher stage of existence that transcends and contains both an aesthetic and ethical value of life. Kierkegaard and Nietzsche were also precursors to other intellectual movements, including [[postmodernism]], and various strands of [[psychology|psychotherapy.]] However, Kierkegaard believed that individuals should live in accordance with their thinking.\n\n====Dostoyevsky====\n\nThe first important literary author also important to existentialism was the Russian [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]].<ref>Hubben, William. ''Dostoyevsky, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche and Kafka, Jabber-wacky'', Scribner, 1997.</ref> Dostoyevsky's ''[[Notes from Underground]]'' portrays a man unable to fit into society and unhappy with the identities he creates for himself. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], in his book on existentialism ''[[Existentialism is a Humanism]]'', quoted Dostoyevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' as an example of [[existential crisis]]. Sartre attributes Ivan Karamazov's claim, \"If God did not exist, everything would be permitted\"<ref>Sartre, Jean-Paul. ''Existentialism is a Humanism'' http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/sartre/works/exist/sartre.htm ; Retrieved 2012-04-01.</ref> to Dostoyevsky himself, though this quote does not appear in the novel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|author=Zizek, Slavoj|title=If there is a God, then everything is permitted|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150417192350/http://www.egs.edu/faculty/slavoj-zizek/articles/if-there-is-a-god-then-anything-is-permitted/|archivedate=2015-04-17|df=}}</ref> However, a similar sentiment is explicitly stated when Alyosha visits Dimitri in prison. Dimitri mentions his conversations with Rakitin in which the idea that \"Then, if He doesn't exist, man is king of the earth, of the universe\" allowing the inference contained in Sartre's attribution to remain a valid idea contested within the novel.<ref>Dostoyevsky Fyodor. \"[[The Brothers Karamazov]]\".</ref> Other Dostoyevsky novels covered issues raised in existentialist philosophy while presenting story lines divergent from secular existentialism: for example, in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'', the protagonist Raskolnikov experiences an existential crisis and then moves toward a Christian Orthodox worldview similar to that advocated by Dostoyevsky himself.<ref name=\"Rukhsana\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/911266433|title=Existentialism and its relevance to the contemporary system of education in India : existentialism and present educational scenario|last=Rukhsana.|first=Akhter,|isbn=3954892774|location=Hamburg|oclc=911266433}}</ref>\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n{{See also|Martin Heidegger}}\n\nIn the first decades of the 20th century, a number of philosophers and writers explored existentialist ideas. The Spanish philosopher [[Miguel de Unamuno y Jugo]], in his 1913 book ''The Tragic Sense of Life in Men and Nations'', emphasized the life of \"flesh and bone\" as opposed to that of abstract rationalism. Unamuno rejected systematic philosophy in favor of the individual's quest for faith. He retained a sense of the tragic, even absurd nature of the quest, symbolized by his enduring interest in [[Cervantes]]' fictional character [[Don Quixote]]. A novelist, poet and dramatist as well as philosophy professor at the University of Salamanca, Unamuno wrote a short story about a priest's crisis of faith, ''[[San Manuel Bueno, M\u00e1rtir|Saint Manuel the Good, Martyr]]'', which has been collected in anthologies of existentialist fiction. Another Spanish thinker, [[Ortega y Gasset]], writing in 1914, held that human existence must always be defined as the individual person combined with the concrete circumstances of his life: \"''Yo soy yo y mi circunstancia''\" (\"I am myself and my circumstances\"). Sartre likewise believed that human existence is not an abstract matter, but is always situated (\"''en situation''\").\n\nAlthough [[Martin Buber]] wrote his major philosophical works in German, and studied and taught at the Universities of Berlin and [[Frankfurt]], he stands apart from the mainstream of German philosophy. Born into a Jewish family in Vienna in 1878, he was also a scholar of Jewish culture and involved at various times in [[Zionism]] and [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]]. In 1938, he moved permanently to [[Jerusalem]]. His best-known philosophical work was the short book ''[[I and Thou]]'', published in 1922. For Buber, the fundamental fact of human existence, too readily overlooked by scientific rationalism and abstract philosophical thought, is \"man with man\", a dialogue that takes place in the so-called \"sphere of between\" (''\"das Zwischenmenschliche\"'').<ref>Maurice S. Friedman, ''Martin Buber. The Life of Dialogue'' (University of Chicago press, 1955, p. 85)</ref>\n\nTwo Russian thinkers, [[Lev Shestov]] and [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], became well known as existentialist thinkers during their post-Revolutionary exiles in Paris. Shestov, born into a Ukrainian-Jewish family in Kiev, had launched an attack on rationalism and systematization in philosophy as early as 1905 in his book of aphorisms ''All Things Are Possible''.\n\nBerdyaev, also from Kiev but with a background in the Eastern Orthodox Church, drew a radical distinction between the world of spirit and the everyday world of objects. Human freedom, for Berdyaev, is rooted in the realm of spirit, a realm independent of scientific notions of causation. To the extent the individual human being lives in the objective world, he is estranged from authentic spiritual freedom. \"Man\" is not to be interpreted naturalistically, but as a being created in God's image, an originator of free, creative acts.<ref>Ernst Breisach, ''Introduction to Modern Existentialism'', New York (1962), pp. 173\u201376</ref> He published a major work on these themes, ''The Destiny of Man'', in 1931.\n\n[[Gabriel Marcel]], long before coining the term \"existentialism\", introduced important existentialist themes to a French audience in his early essay \"Existence and Objectivity\" (1925) and in his ''Metaphysical Journal'' (1927).<ref name=\"Samuel M. Keen 1967\">Samuel M. Keen, \"Gabriel Marcel\" in Paul Edwards (ed.) ''The Encyclopaedia of Philosophy'' (Macmillan Publishing Co, 1967)</ref> A dramatist as well as a philosopher, Marcel found his philosophical starting point in a condition of metaphysical alienation: the human individual searching for harmony in a transient life. Harmony, for Marcel, was to be sought through \"secondary reflection\", a \"dialogical\" rather than \"dialectical\" approach to the world, characterized by \"wonder and astonishment\" and open to the \"presence\" of other people and of God rather than merely to \"information\" about them. For Marcel, such presence implied more than simply being there (as one thing might be in the presence of another thing); it connoted \"extravagant\" availability, and the willingness to put oneself at the disposal of the other.<ref>John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 110)</ref>\n\nMarcel contrasted ''secondary reflection'' with abstract, scientific-technical ''primary reflection'', which he associated with the activity of the abstract [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes|Cartesian]] ego. For Marcel, philosophy was a concrete activity undertaken by a sensing, feeling human being incarnate\u2014embodied\u2014in a concrete world.<ref name=\"Samuel M. Keen 1967\"/><ref>John Macquarrie, ''Existentialism'' (Pelican, 1973, p. 96)</ref> Although [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] adopted the term \"existentialism\" for his own philosophy in the 1940s, Marcel's thought has been described as \"almost diametrically opposed\" to that of Sartre.<ref name=\"Samuel M. Keen 1967\"/> Unlike Sartre, Marcel was a Christian, and became a Catholic convert in 1929.\n\nIn Germany, the psychologist and philosopher [[Karl Jaspers]]\u2014who later described existentialism as a \"phantom\" created by the public<ref>Karl Jaspers, \"Philosophical Autobiography\" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/11)</ref>\u2014called his own thought, heavily influenced by Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, ''Existenzphilosophie''. For Jaspers, \"''Existenz''-philosophy is the way of thought by means of which man seeks to become himself...This way of thought does not cognize objects, but elucidates and makes actual the being of the thinker\".<ref>Karl Jaspers, \"Philosophical Autobiography\" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 40)</ref>\n\nJaspers, a professor at the University of [[Heidelberg]], was acquainted with [[Martin Heidegger]], who held a professorship at [[Marburg]] before acceding to Husserl's chair at [[Freiburg]] in 1928. They held many philosophical discussions, but later became estranged over Heidegger's support of [[Nazism|National Socialism]] (Nazism). They shared an admiration for Kierkegaard,<ref>Karl Jaspers, \"Philosophical Autobiography\" in Paul Arthur Schilpp (ed.) ''The Philosophy of Karl Jaspers (The Library of Living Philosophers IX (Tudor Publishing Company, 1957, p. 75/2 and following)</ref> and in the 1930s, Heidegger lectured extensively on Nietzsche. Nevertheless, the extent to which Heidegger should be considered an existentialist is debatable. In ''[[Being and Time]]'' he presented a method of rooting philosophical explanations in human existence (''Dasein'') to be analysed in terms of existential categories (''existentiale''); and this has led many commentators to treat him as an important figure in the existentialist movement.\n\n=== After the Second World War ===\n\nFollowing the [[Second World War]], existentialism became a well-known and significant philosophical and cultural movement, mainly through the public prominence of two French writers, [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Albert Camus]], who wrote best-selling novels, plays and widely read journalism as well as theoretical texts.<ref>Patrick Baert, ''The Existentialist Moment; The Rise of Sartre as a Public Intellectual'' (Polity Press, 2015)</ref> These years also saw the growing reputation of Heidegger's book ''[[Being and Time]]'' outside Germany.\n[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|upright|French philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]]]]\n\nSartre dealt with existentialist themes in his 1938 novel ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' and the short stories in his 1939 collection ''[[The Wall (book)|The Wall]]'', and had published his treatise on existentialism, ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', in 1943, but it was in the two years following the liberation of Paris from the German occupying forces that he and his close associates\u2014Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, and others\u2014became internationally famous as the leading figures of a movement known as existentialism.<ref name=\"Ronald Aronson 2004\">Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, chapter 3 ''passim'')</ref> In a very short period of time, Camus and Sartre in particular became the leading public intellectuals of post-war France, achieving by the end of 1945 \"a fame that reached across all audiences.\"<ref>Ronald Aronson, ''Camus and Sartre'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004, p. 44)</ref> Camus was an editor of the most popular leftist (former [[French Resistance]]) newspaper ''[[Combat (newspaper)|Combat]]''; Sartre launched his journal of leftist thought, ''[[Les Temps Modernes]]'', and two weeks later gave the widely reported lecture on existentialism and [[secular humanism]] to a packed meeting of the Club Maintenant.

In the titular book, Camus uses the analogy of the Greek myth of [[Sisyphus]] to demonstrate the futility of existence. In the myth, Sisyphus is condemned for eternity to roll a rock up a hill, but when he reaches the summit, the rock will roll to the bottom again. Camus believes that this existence is pointless but that Sisyphus ultimately finds meaning and purpose in his task, simply by continually applying himself to it. The first half of the book contains an extended rebuttal of what Camus took to be existentialist philosophy in the works of Kierkegaard, Shestov, Heidegger, and Jaspers.\n\n[[Simone de Beauvoir]], an important existentialist who spent much of her life as Sartre's partner, wrote about feminist and existentialist ethics in her works, including ''[[The Second Sex]]'' and ''[[The Ethics of Ambiguity]]''. Although often overlooked due to her relationship with Sartre,<ref name = Bergoffen-SEoP>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/|title=Simone de Beauvoir|encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |author=Bergoffen, Debra|date=September 2010}}</ref> de Beauvoir integrated existentialism with other forms of thinking such as feminism, unheard of at the time, resulting in alienation from fellow writers such as Camus.<ref name=\"Rukhsana\"/>\n\n[[Paul Tillich]], an important existentialist theologian following Kierkegaard and [[Karl Barth]], applied existentialist concepts to [[Christian theology]], and helped introduce [[neo-orthodoxy|existential theology]] to the general public. His seminal work ''The Courage to Be'' follows Kierkegaard's analysis of anxiety and life's absurdity, but puts forward the thesis that modern humans must, via God, achieve selfhood in spite of life's absurdity. [[Rudolf Bultmann]] used Kierkegaard's and Heidegger's philosophy of existence to demythologize Christianity by interpreting Christian mythical concepts into existentialist concepts.\n\n[[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], an [[Existential phenomenology|existential phenomenologist]], was for a time a companion of Sartre. Merleau-Ponty's ''[[Phenomenology of Perception]]'' (1945) was recognized as a major statement of French existentialism.<ref>Madison, G. B., in Robert Audi's ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999) [p. 559]</ref> It has been said that Merleau-Ponty's work ''Humanism and Terror'' greatly influenced Sartre. However, in later years they were to disagree irreparably, dividing many existentialists such as de Beauvoir,<ref name=\"Rukhsana\"/> who sided with Sartre.\n\n[[Colin Wilson]], an English writer, published his study ''[[The Outsider (Colin Wilson)|The Outsider]]'' in 1956, initially to critical acclaim. In this book and others (e.g. ''Introduction to the New Existentialism''), he attempted to reinvigorate what he perceived as a pessimistic philosophy and bring it to a wider audience. He was not, however, academically trained, and his work was attacked by professional philosophers for lack of rigor and critical standards.<ref>K.

The play begins with a Valet leading a man into a room that the audience soon realizes is in hell. Eventually he is joined by two women. After their entry, the Valet leaves and the door is shut and locked. All three expect to be tortured, but no torturer arrives. Instead, they realize they are there to torture each other, which they do effectively by probing each other's sins, desires, and unpleasant memories.\n\nExistentialist themes are displayed in the [[Theatre of the Absurd]], notably in [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in which two men divert themselves while they wait expectantly for someone (or something) named Godot who never arrives. They claim Godot is an acquaintance, but in fact, hardly know him, admitting they would not recognize him if they saw him. Samuel Beckett, once asked who or what Godot is, replied, \"If I knew, I would have said so in the play.\" To occupy themselves, the men eat, sleep, talk, argue, sing, play games, [[Physical exercise|exercise]], swap hats, and contemplate [[suicide]]\u2014anything \"to hold the terrible silence at bay\".<ref>''The Times'', 31 December 1964. Quoted in Knowlson, J., ''Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett'' (London: Bloomsbury, 1996), p. 57</ref> The play \"exploits several archetypal forms and situations, all of which lend themselves to both comedy and [[pathos]].\"<ref>Cronin, A., ''Samuel Beckett The Last Modernist'' (London: Flamingo, 1997), p. 391</ref> The play also illustrates an attitude toward human experience on earth: the poignancy, oppression, camaraderie, hope, corruption, and bewilderment of human experience that can be reconciled only in the mind and art of the absurdist. The play examines questions such as death, the [[Meaning of life (philosophy)#Existentialism|meaning of human existence]] and the place of God in human existence.\n\n[[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead]]'' is an [[Theatre of the Absurd|absurdist]] [[tragicomedy]] first staged at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 1966.<ref name=\"Chrono\">{{cite web | author= Michael H.

Comparisons have also been drawn to [[Samuel Beckett]]'s ''[[Waiting For Godot]]'', for the presence of two central characters who appear almost as two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing [[Questions (game)|Questions]], impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time. The two characters are portrayed as two clowns or fools in a world beyond their understanding. They stumble through philosophical arguments while not realizing the implications, and muse on the irrationality and randomness of the world.\n\n[[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''[[Antigone (Anouilh play)|Antigone]]'' also presents arguments founded on existentialist ideas.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wren|first=Celia |date= 12 December 2007 |title= From Forum, an Earnest and Painstaking 'Antigone' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/11/AR2007121102254.html |publisher=Washington Post |accessdate=2008-04-07}}</ref> It is a tragedy inspired by Greek mythology and the play of the same name (Antigone, by Sophocles) from the 5th century BC. In English, it is often distinguished from its antecedent by being pronounced in its original French form, approximately \"Ante-G\u014cN.\" The play was first performed in Paris on 6 February 1944, during the Nazi occupation of France. Produced under Nazi censorship, the play is purposefully ambiguous with regards to the rejection of authority (represented by Antigone) and the acceptance of it (represented by Creon). The parallels to the French Resistance and the Nazi occupation have been drawn. Antigone rejects life as desperately meaningless but without affirmatively choosing a noble death. The crux of the play is the lengthy dialogue concerning the nature of power, fate, and choice, during which Antigone says that she is, \"...&nbsp;disgusted with [the]...promise of a humdrum happiness.\" She states that she would rather die than live a mediocre existence.\n\nCritic [[Martin Esslin]] in his book ''Theatre of the Absurd'' pointed out how many contemporary playwrights such as [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco]], [[Jean Genet]], and [[Arthur Adamov]] wove into their plays the existentialist belief that we are absurd beings loose in a universe empty of real meaning. Esslin noted that many of these playwrights demonstrated the philosophy better than did the plays by Sartre and Camus. Though most of such playwrights, subsequently labeled \"Absurdist\" (based on Esslin's book), denied affiliations with existentialism and were often staunchly anti-philosophical (for example Ionesco often claimed he identified more with [['Pataphysics]] or with [[Surrealism]] than with existentialism), the playwrights are often linked to existentialism based on Esslin's observation.<ref>Kernan, Alvin B. ''The Modern American Theater: A Collection of Critical Essays''. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: [[Prentice-Hall]], 1967.</ref>\n\n=== Psychoanalysis and psychotherapy ===\n{{Main article|Existential therapy}}\n\nA major offshoot of existentialism as a philosophy is existentialist psychology and psychoanalysis, which first crystallized in the work of [[Otto Rank]], Freud's closest associate for 20 years. Without awareness of the writings of Rank, [[Ludwig Binswanger]] was influenced by [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]]. A later figure was [[Viktor Frankl]], who briefly met [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and studied with [[Carl Jung|Jung]] as a young man.<ref>[http://www.logotherapie-international.eu/Frankl-Jung.English%20summary.pdf?2f569316a8c0d70a23e25e57788725a0=877b85765d9546f605211252412792ec Logotherapie-international.eu]</ref> His [[logotherapy]] can be regarded as a form of existentialist therapy. The existentialists would also influence [[social psychology]], antipositivist micro-[[sociology]], [[symbolic interactionism]], and [[post-structuralism]], with the work of thinkers such as [[Georg Simmel]]<ref>Stewart, Jon. ''Kierkegaard and Existentialism''. p. 38</ref> and [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault was a great reader of Kierkegaard even though he almost never refers this author, who nonetheless had for him an importance as secret as it was decisive.<ref>Flynn, Thomas R. ''Sartre, Foucault, and Historical Reason'', p. 323.</ref>\n\nAn early contributor to existentialist psychology in the United States was [[Rollo May]], who was strongly influenced by [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Otto Rank]]. One of the most prolific writers on techniques and theory of existentialist psychology in the USA is [[Irvin D. Yalom]]. Yalom states that\n<blockquote>\nAside from their reaction against Freud's mechanistic, deterministic model of the mind and their assumption of a phenomenological approach in therapy, the existentialist analysts have little in common and have never been regarded as a cohesive ideological school. These thinkers\u2014who include Ludwig Binswanger, [[Medard Boss]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Minkowski]], V.E. Gebsattel, Roland Kuhn, G. Caruso, F.T. Buytendijk, G. Bally and Victor Frankl\u2014were almost entirely unknown to the American psychotherapeutic community until Rollo May's highly influential 1985 book ''Existence''\u2014and especially his introductory essay\u2014introduced their work into this country.<ref name=Yalom1980>{{Cite book| first= Irvin D.| last= Yalom| author-link= Irvin D.

Therapists often offer existentialist [[philosophy]] as an explanation for anxiety. The assertion is that anxiety is manifested of an individual's complete freedom to decide, and complete responsibility for the outcome of such decisions. Psychotherapists using an existentialist approach believe that a patient can harness his anxiety and use it constructively. Instead of suppressing anxiety, patients are advised to use it as grounds for change. By embracing anxiety as inevitable, a person can use it to achieve his full potential in life. [[Humanistic psychology]] also had major impetus from existentialist psychology and shares many of the fundamental tenets. [[Terror management theory]], based on the writings of [[Ernest Becker]] and [[Otto Rank]], is a developing area of study within the academic study of psychology. It looks at what researchers claim are implicit emotional reactions of people confronted with the knowledge that they will eventually die.\n\nAlso, [[Gerd B. Achenbach]] has refreshed the Socratic tradition with his own blend of [[philosophical counseling]]. So did [[Michel Weber]] with his Chromatiques Center in Belgium.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\n=== General criticisms ===\n\n[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] criticized 'the profoundly unsound methods and the dangerous contempt for reason that have been so prominent in existentialism.'<ref>Kaufmann, Walter Arnold, From Shakespeare To Existentialism (Princeton University Press 1979), p. xvi</ref>\n[[Logical positivists|Logical positivist]] philosophers, such as [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[A. J. Ayer]], assert that existentialists are often confused about the verb \"to be\" in their analyses of \"being\".<ref name=\"Carnap, Rudolf 1932 pp. 219\">Carnap, Rudolf, ''Uberwindung der Metaphysik durch logische Analyse der Sprache'' [''Overcoming Metaphysics by the Logical Analysis of Speech''], Erkenntnis (1932), pp. 219\u201341. Carnap's critique of Heidegger's \"What is Metaphysics\".\n</ref> Specifically, they argue that the verb \"is\" is transitive and pre-fixed to a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (e.g., an apple ''is red'') (without a predicate, the word \"is\" is meaningless), and that existentialists frequently misuse the term in this manner. [[Colin Wilson]] has stated in his book ''The Angry Years'' that existentialism has created many of its own difficulties: \"we can see how this question of freedom of the will has been vitiated by post-romantic philosophy, with its inbuilt tendency to laziness and [[boredom]], we can also see how it came about that existentialism found itself in a hole of its own digging, and how the philosophical developments since then have amounted to walking in circles round that hole\".<ref>Colin, Wilson, ''The Angry Years'' (2007), p. 214</ref>\n\n===Sartre's philosophy===\nMany critics argue [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s philosophy is contradictory. Specifically, they argue that Sartre makes metaphysical arguments despite his claiming that his philosophical views ignore metaphysics. [[Herbert Marcuse]] criticized Sartre's 1943 ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' for projecting anxiety and meaninglessness onto the nature of existence itself: \"Insofar as Existentialism is a philosophical doctrine, it remains an idealistic doctrine: it [[hypostatic abstraction|hypostatizes]] specific historical conditions of human existence into ontological and metaphysical characteristics. Existentialism thus becomes part of the very ideology which it attacks, and its radicalism is illusory\".<ref name=Marcuse1972>Marcuse, Herbert. \"Sartre's Existentialism\". Printed in ''Studies in Critical Philosophy''. Translated by Joris De Bres. London: NLB, 1972. p. 161</ref>\n\nIn ''Letter on Humanism'', [[Martin Heidegger]] criticized Sartre's existentialism:\n\n<blockquote>Existentialism says existence precedes essence. In this statement he is taking ''existentia'' and ''essentia'' according to their metaphysical meaning, which, from Plato's time on, has said that ''essentia'' precedes ''existentia''. Sartre reverses this statement. But the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.

[[Aposiopesis]] is the use of an ellipsis to trail off into silence\u2014for example: \"But I thought he was \u2026\" When placed at the beginning or end of a sentence, the ellipsis can also inspire a feeling of melancholy or longing.\n\nThe most common form of an ellipsis is a row of three periods or full points<!--Not full stop; the full stop is the role played by the full point in terminating a sentence.--> (...) or a precomposed triple-dot glyph (\u2026).  The usage of the [[em dash]] (\u2014) can overlap the usage of the ellipsis, especially in dialogue. Style guides often have their own rules governing the use of ellipses. For example, ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'' (''Chicago'' style) recommends that an ellipsis be formed by typing three periods, each with a space on both sides (&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;), while the ''[[Associated Press Stylebook]]'' (''AP'' style) puts the dots together, but retains a space before and after the group.<ref>{{cite web |title=Em Dashes and Ellipses: Closed or Spaced Out? |first=Karen |last=Yin |work=AP vs Chicago: Edit or Die |publisher=Quiet Press |date=2011 |url= https://apvschicago.com/2011/05/em-dashes-and-ellipses-closed-or-spaced.html |access-date=27 July 2018}} {{better source needed|date=July 2018|reason=Just some blog; better to get this from official AP materials, but this will do for now.}}</ref>\n\nWhether an ellipsis at the end of a sentence needs a fourth dot to finish the sentence is a matter of debate; ''Chicago'' advises it,<ref>''The Chicago Manual of Style'', 17th edition (2017), \u00a7&thinsp;13.51\u201352.</ref> as does the ''[[Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]]'' (APA style),<ref>Summarized here: {{cite web |first=Paige |last=Jackson |title=Ellipses\u2013When and How? |date=22 April 2011 |work=Blog.APAStyle.org |publisher=[[American Psychological Association]] |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/04/ellipses-when-and-how.html |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171210122450/http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/04/ellipses-when-and-how.html |archive-date=10 December 2017 |access-date=27 July 2018}}</ref>, while some other style guides do not;{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Should be easy to source, but we need to actually do it.}} the ''[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary'' and related works treat this style as optional, saying that it \"may\" be used.<ref>{{cite web |title=Usage Notes: All About Ellipses \u2013 It's time to stop calling them 'dot dot dot' |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2017 |work=Merriam-Webster.com |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |url= https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/ellipses-definition-uses |dead-url=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170531171513/https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/ellipses-definition-uses |archive-date=31 May 2017 |access-date=27 July 2018}}</ref> More commonly, a normal full stop (period) terminates the sentence, then a {{em|separate}} three-dot ellipsis is used to indicate one or more subsequent elided sentences before continuing a longer quotation.

For example, when Sue says \"I never drink wine&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;\", the implication is that she does drink something else{{mdash}}such as vodka.\n\nIn reported speech, the ellipsis can be used to represent an intentional silence.\n\nIn poetry, an ellipsis is used as a thought-pause or [[Line break (poetry)|line break]] at the [[caesura]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classroom.synonym.com/ellipses-poem-3994.html|title=What Are Ellipses in a Poem?|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2018}}</ref>  or this is used to highlight sarcasm or make the reader think about the last points in the poem.\n\nIn news reporting, often associated with [[brackets]], it is used to indicate that a quotation has been condensed for space, brevity or relevance.\n\n[[Herb Caen]], Pulitzer-prize-winning columnist for the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', became famous for his \"three-dot journalism\".<ref name=Caen>[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/492296/HERB-CAEN-WAY----HONORS-SF-COLUMNIST.html `HERB CAEN WAY . . .'

There are two commonly used methods of using ellipses: one uses three dots for any omission, while the second one makes a distinction between omissions within a sentence (using three dots:&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) and omissions between sentences (using a period and a space followed by three dots:&nbsp;.&nbsp;...).\n\nThe [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) used to indicate that an ellipsis must include spaces before and after each dot in all uses. If an ellipsis is meant to represent an omission, [[square bracket]]s must surround the ellipsis to make it clear that there was no pause in the original quote: [&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;]. Currently, the MLA has removed the requirement of brackets in its style handbooks. However, some maintain that the use of brackets is still correct because it clears confusion.<ref>Fowler, H. Ramsey, Jane E. Aaron, Murray McArthur. ''The Little, Brown Handbook''. Fourth Canadian Edition. [[Toronto]]: [[Longman|Pearson Longman]]. 2005. p. 440.</ref>\n\nThe MLA now indicates that a three-dot, spaced ellipsis (&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) should be used for removing material from within one sentence within a quote. When crossing sentences (when the omitted text contains a period, so that omitting the end of a sentence counts), a four-dot, spaced (except for before the first dot) ellipsis (.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;) should be used. When ellipsis points are used in the original text, ellipsis points that are not in the original text should be distinguished by enclosing them in square brackets (e.g. \"text [\u2026] text\").<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uhv.edu/student-success-center/resources/e-p/ellipsis-use-in-mla-style/|last=Jones|first=Karalyn|title=Using Ellipsis in MLA Style|institution=[[University of Houston\u2013Victoria]]|year=2009}}</ref><ref>http://naropa.edu/documents/programs/jks/naropa-writing-center/citation-comparison.pdf</ref>\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, the ellipsis should be used to condense quotations. It is less commonly used to indicate a pause in speech or an unfinished thought or to separate items in material such as show business gossip. The stylebook indicates that if the shortened sentence before the mark can stand as a sentence, it should do so, with an ellipsis placed after the period or other ending punctuation. When material is omitted at the end of a paragraph and also immediately following it, an ellipsis goes both at the end of that paragraph and at the beginning of the next, according to this style.<ref>Goldstein, Norm, editor. \"Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law\". 2005. pp.328\u2013329.</ref>\n\nAccording to Robert Bringhurst's ''[[Elements of Typographic Style]]'', the details of typesetting ellipses depend on the character and size of the font being set and the typographer's preference. Bringhurst writes that a full space between each dot is \"another Victorian eccentricity. In most contexts, the Chicago ellipsis is much too wide\"\u2014he recommends using flush dots, or [[thin space|''thin''-spaced]] dots (up to one-fifth of an [[em (typography)|em]]), or the prefabricated ellipsis character ({{unichar|1=2026|2=HORIZONTAL ELLIPSIS|html=}}. Bringhurst suggests that normally an ellipsis should be spaced fore-and-aft to separate it from the text, but when it combines with other punctuation, the leading space disappears and the other punctuation follows. This is the usual practice in typesetting. He provides the following examples:\n\n{| summary=\"six examples of setting ellipsis\" style=\"margin-left:3em;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | i&nbsp;\u2026 j\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | k\u2026.\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | l\u2026, l\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | l,&nbsp;\u2026 l\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | m\u2026?\n| style=\"width:5em;\" | n\u2026!\n|}\n\nIn legal writing in the United States, Rule 5.3 in the ''[[Bluebook]]'' citation guide governs the use of ellipses and requires a space before the first dot and between the two subsequent dots. If an ellipsis ends the sentence, then there are three dots, each separated by a space, followed by the final punctuation (e.g. Hah . . . ?). In some legal writing, an ellipsis is written as three [[asterisk]]s (*** or *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*) to make it obvious that text has been omitted.\n(...) is also used for awkward silence.\n\n===In British English===\n\n''The [[Hart's Rules|Oxford Style Guide]]'' recommends setting the ellipsis as a single character (\u2026) or as a series of three (narrow) spaced dots (.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.), and surrounding it by spaces. If there is an ellipsis at the end of an incomplete sentence, the final full stop is omitted. However, it is retained if the following ellipsis represents an omission between two complete sentences.<ref>''New Hart's Rules: The Oxford Style Guide''. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014.</ref>\n\n: ''The \u2026 fox jumps \u2026''\n: ''The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. \u2026 And if they have not died, they are still alive today.''\n\nContrary to ''The Oxford Style Guide'', the ''University of Oxford Style Guide'' demands an ellipsis not to be surrounded by spaces, except when it stands for a pause; then, a space has to be set after the ellipsis (but not before). An ellipsis is never preceded or followed by a full stop.<ref>''[https://www.ox.ac.uk/sites/files/oxford/University%20of%20Oxford%20Style%20Guide%20%28updated%20Hilary%20term%202016%29.pdf University of Oxford Style Guide: Hilary term 2016]'' (PDF).

The word ''wielokropek'' distinguishes the ellipsis of Polish syntax from that of [[mathematical notation]], in which it is known as an {{lang|pl|elipsa}}.\n\nWhen an ellipsis replaces a fragment omitted from a quotation, the ellipsis is enclosed in parentheses or square brackets. An unbracketed ellipsis indicates an interruption or pause in speech.\n\nThe syntactical rules for ellipses are standardized by the 1983 Polska Norma document [[PN-83/P-55366]], {{lang|pl|Zasady sk\u0142adania tekst\u00f3w w j\u0119zyku polskim}} (\"Rules for setting texts in the Polish Language\").\n\n===In Russian===\nThe combination \"ellipsis+period\" is replaced by the ellipsis. The combinations \"ellipsis+exclamation mark\" and \"ellipsis+question mark\" are written in this way: !.. ?..\n\n===In Japanese===\nThe most common character corresponding to an ellipsis is called ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 (\"''3''-dot leaders\", {{lang|ja|\u2026}}). 2-ten r\u012bd\u0101 exists as a character, but it is used less commonly. In writing, the ellipsis consists usually of six dots (two ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 characters, {{lang|ja|\u2026\u2026}}). Three dots (one ''3''-ten r\u012bd\u0101 character) may be used where space is limited, such as in a header. However, variations in the number of dots exist. In horizontally written text the dots are commonly vertically centered within the text height (between the [[Baseline (typography)|baseline]] and the ascent line), as in the standard Japanese [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] fonts; in vertically written text the dots are always centered horizontally. As the Japanese word for dot is pronounced \"{{lang|ja-Latn|ten}}\", the dots are colloquially called \"{{lang|ja-Latn|ten-ten-ten}}\" ({{lang|ja|\u3066\u3093\u3066\u3093\u3066\u3093}}, akin to the English \"dot dot dot\")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanspo.com/geino/news/20170605/geo17060514190023-n1.html |title=\u79cb\u5143\u9806\u5b50\u3001\u53e4\u5e0c\u306b\u5f97\u610f\u306e\u30c0\u30b8\u30e3\u30ec\u3000\u300c\u3042\u307e\u308a\u201c\u30b3\u30ad\u201d\u4f7f\u308f\u306a\u3044\u3067\u304f\u3060\u3055\u3044\u300d |date=2017-06-05 |website=SANSPO.COM |publisher=SANKEI DIGITAL Inc. |access-date=2018-01-10}}</ref>.\n\nIn [[manga]], the ellipsis by itself represents speechlessness, or a \"[[pregnant pause]]\". Depending on the context, this could be anything from an admission of guilt to an expression of being dumbfounded at another person's words or actions. As a device, the ''ten-ten-ten'' is intended to focus the reader on a character while allowing the character to not speak any dialogue. This conveys to the reader a focus of the narrative \"camera\" on the silent subject, implying an expectation of some motion or action. It is not unheard of to see inanimate objects \"speaking\" the ellipsis.\n\n===In Chinese===\nIn [[Chinese language|Chinese]], the ellipsis is six dots (in two groups of three dots, occupying the same horizontal or vertical space as two characters) (i.e. <span lang=\"zh\">\u2026\u2026</span>).<ref>[[:zh-tw:\u7701\u7565\u53f7|\u7701\u7565\u53f7]]</ref>\n\n===In Spanish===\nIn [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ellipsis is commonly used as a substitute of ''[[et cetera]]'' at the end of unfinished lists. So it means \"and so forth\" or \"and other things\".\n\nOther use is the suspension of a part of a text, or a paragraph, or a phrase or a part of a word because it is obvious, or unnecessary, or implied. For instance, sometimes the ellipsis is used to avoid the complete use of expletives.\n\nWhen the ellipsis is placed alone into a [[Bracket|parenthesis]] (...) or\u2014less often\u2014between [[bracket]]s [\u2026], which is what happens usually within a text [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], it means the original text had more contents on the same position but are not useful to our target in the transcription. When the suppressed text is at the beginning or at the end of a text, the ellipsis does not need to be placed in a parenthesis.\n\n===In French===\nIn [[French language|French]], the ellipsis is commonly used at the end of lists to represent ''et cetera''. In French typography, the ellipsis is written close up to the preceding word but has a space after it, for example: ''comme \u00e7a\u2026 pas comme ceci''. If, exceptionally, it begins a sentence, there is a space before and after, for example: ''Lui ? \u2026 vaut rien, je crois\u2026 ''.\n\nHowever, any omitted word, phrase or line at the end of a quoted passage would be  indicated like this: [...] (space before and after the square brackets but not inside), for example: '' \u2026 \u00e0 Paris, Nice, Nantes, Toulouse [\u2026] ''.\n\n===In German===\nIn [[German language|German]], the ellipsis in general is surrounded by spaces, if it stands for one or more omitted words. On the other side there is no space between a letter or (part of) a word and an ellipsis, if it stands for one or more omitted letters, that should stick to the written letter or letters.\n\nExample for both cases, using German style: ''The first el\u2026is stands for omitted letters, the second \u2026 for an omitted word.''\n\nIf the ellipsis is at the end of a sentence, the final full stop is omitted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rechtschreibrat.com/DOX/rfdr_regeln_inkl_Nachtraegen.pdf |title=Deutsche Rechtschreibung.

In a list, between commas, or following a comma, a normal ellipsis is used, as in:\n\n: <math>1,2,3,\\ldots,100</math>\n\nor to mean an infinite list, as:\n\n: <math>1,2,3,\\ldots</math>\n\nTo indicate the omission of values in a repeated operation, an ellipsis raised to the center of the line is used between two operation symbols or following the last operation symbol, as in:\n\n: <math>1+2+3+\\cdots+100</math>\n\nSometimes, e.g. in Russian mathematical texts, normal, non-raised, ellipses are used even in repeated summations<ref>\u041c\u0438\u043b\u044c\u0447\u0438\u043d \u0410. \u042d.

For this reason, and because the ellipsis supports no systematic rules for symbolic calculation, in recent years some authors have recommended avoiding its use in mathematics altogether.<ref>Roland Backhouse, ''Program Construction: Calculating Implementations from Specifications''.  Wiley (2003), page 138</ref>\n\n== Programming languages ==\nA two- or three-dot ellipsis is used as an [[operator (programming)|operator]] in some [[programming language]]s. The precise meaning varies by language, but it generally involves something dealing with multiple items. One of its most common uses is in defining ranges or sequences. This is used in many languages, including Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, Haskell, Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash shell and F#. It is also used to indicate so called [[variadic function]]s in the C, C++ and Java languages. ''See [[Ellipsis (programming operator)]]''.\n\n===HTML and CSS===\nThe CSS <code>text-overflow</code> property can be set to <code>ellipsis</code>, which cuts off text with an ellipsis when it overflows the content area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-overflow|title=text-overflow|website=Mozilla Developer Network|accessdate=12 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://drafts.csswg.org/css-ui-3/#text-overflow|title=CSS Basic User Interface Module Level 3 (CSS3 UI)|website=drafts.csswg.org|accessdate=12 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==On the Internet and in text messaging==\nThe ellipsis is a non-verbal cue that is often used in computer-mediated interactions, in particular in synchronous genres, such as chat.

In a type constraint expression like <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)</code> an ellipsis is used to separate the extension root from extension additions. The definition of type A in version 1 system of the form <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ...)</code> and the definition of type A in version 2 system of the form <code>A ::= INTEGER (0..127, ..., 256..511)</code> constitute an extension series of the same type A in different versions of the same specification. The ellipsis can also be used in compound type definitions to separate the set of fields belonging to the extension root from the set of fields constituting extension additions. Here is an example: <code>B ::= SEQUENCE { a INTEGER, b INTEGER, ..., c INTEGER }</code> <!-- Is the s.n. ellipsis defined as a \"...\" trigraph or something else?

On 6 August 1945, during the final stages of [[World War II]], it became the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|first aircraft to drop an atomic bomb]]. The bomb, code-named \"[[Little Boy]]\", was targeted at the city of [[Hiroshima]], Japan, and caused the near-complete destruction of the city. ''Enola Gay'' participated in the second atomic attack as the weather reconnaissance aircraft for the primary target of [[Kokura]]. Clouds and drifting smoke resulted in a secondary target, [[Nagasaki]], being bombed instead.\n\nAfter the war, the ''Enola Gay'' returned to the United States, where it was operated from [[Walker Air Force Base|Roswell Army Air Field]], [[New Mexico]]. In May 1946, it was flown to [[Kwajalein]] for the [[Operation Crossroads]] [[nuclear test]]s in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at [[Bikini Atoll]]. Later that year it was transferred to the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being disassembled and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at [[Suitland, Maryland]], in 1961.\n\nIn the 1980s, veterans groups engaged in a call for the Smithsonian to put the aircraft on display, leading to an acrimonious debate about exhibiting the aircraft without a proper historical context. The cockpit and nose section of the aircraft were exhibited at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] (NASM) in downtown Washington, D.C., for the bombing's 50th anniversary in 1995, amid controversy. Since 2003, the entire restored B-29 has been on display at NASM's [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. The last survivor of its crew, [[Theodore Van Kirk]], died on 28 July 2014 at the age of 93.\n\n==World War II==\n\n===Early history===\nThe ''Enola Gay'' (Model number B-29-45-MO,{{refn|The ''block number'' was a one- to three-digit number, followed by a two-letter code that represented the aircraft built to the same engineering specification. The two-letter code represented the plant at which the aircraft was built, in this case, Martin in Omaha. This was combined with the aircraft model designation (B-29) to form the ''model number'' {{sfn|Mann|2004|p=100}}|group=N}} Serial number 44-86292, [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|Victor number]] 82) was built by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] (later part of [[Lockheed Martin]]) at its [[Bellevue, Nebraska]], plant, located at what is now known as [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. The bomber was one of the 15 initial examples of [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]]s built to the \"[[Silverplate]]\" specification\u201465 of these eventually being completed during and after World War II\u2014giving them the primary ability to function as nuclear \"weapon delivery\" aircraft. These modifications included an extensively modified bomb bay with pneumatic doors and British bomb attachment and release systems, reversible pitch propellers that gave more braking power on landing, improved engines with fuel injection and better cooling,{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=14\u201315}}<ref name=\"AirIll\">March, Peter R. \"Enola Gay Restored\".

Tibbets Jr.]], the commander of the [[509th Composite Group]], on 9 May 1945, while still on the [[assembly line]]. The aircraft was accepted by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 18 May 1945 and assigned to the [[393d Bomb Squadron|393d Bombardment Squadron, Heavy]], 509th Composite Group. Crew B-9, commanded by [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Robert A. Lewis]], took delivery of the bomber and flew it from Omaha to the 509th's base at [[Wendover Army Air Field]], [[Utah]], on 14 June 1945.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}\n\nThirteen days later, the aircraft left Wendover for [[Guam]], where it received a bomb-bay modification, and flew to [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], [[Tinian]], on 6 July. It was initially given the Victor (squadron-assigned identification) number 12, but on 1 August, was given the [[USAAF unit identification aircraft markings#XXI Bomber Command|circle R tail markings]] of the [[6th Operations Group|6th Bombardment Group]] as a security measure and had its Victor number changed to 82 to avoid misidentification with actual 6th Bombardment Group aircraft.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}}  During July, the bomber made eight practice or training flights, and flew two missions, on 24 and 26 July, to drop [[pumpkin bomb]]s on industrial targets at [[Kobe]] and [[Nagoya]]. ''Enola Gay'' was used on 31 July on a rehearsal flight for the actual mission.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|p=117}}\n\nThe partially assembled [[Little Boy]] [[gun-type fission weapon]] L-11, weighing {{convert|10000|lb}}, was contained inside a {{convert|41|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|47|in|cm|adj=on}} \u00d7 {{convert|138|in|cm|adj=on}} wooden crate that was secured to the deck of the {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}}.

At a time when Dad had thought I had lost my marbles, she had taken my side and said, \"I know you will be all right, son.\"{{sfn|Tibbets|1998|p=203}} }}\n\nThe name was painted on the aircraft on 5 August by Allan L. Karl, an enlisted man in the 509th.{{sfn|Campbell|2005|pp=191\u2013192}} Regularly-assigned aircraft commander Robert Lewis was unhappy to be displaced by Tibbets for this important mission, and became furious when he arrived at the aircraft on the morning of 6 August to see it painted with the now-famous nose art.{{sfn|Thomas|Morgan-Witts|1977|pp=382\u2013383}}\n\n[[Hiroshima]] was the primary target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as alternative targets. ''Enola Gay'', piloted by Tibbets, took off from [[North Field (Tinian)|North Field]], in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called ''[[Necessary Evil (aircraft)|Necessary Evil]]'', commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the [[Manhattan Project]], [[Major general (United States)|Major General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned out the window to direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, he gave a friendly wave for the cameras.{{sfn|Polmar|2004|pp=31\u201332}}\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hiroshima explosion]]\n\nAfter leaving Tinian, the aircraft made their way separately to [[Iwo Jima]], where they rendezvoused at {{convert|2440|m|ft|sp=us}} and set course for Japan. The aircraft arrived over the target in clear visibility at {{convert|9855|m|ft|sp=us}}. Captain [[William Sterling Parsons|William S. \"Deak\" Parsons]] of [[Project Alberta]], who was in command of the mission, armed the bomb during the flight to minimize the risks during takeoff.

By the early 1980s, two veterans of the 509th, Don Rehl and his former navigator in the 509th, Frank B. Stewart, began lobbying for the aircraft to be restored and put on display. They enlisted Tibbets and Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] in their campaign. In 1983, [[Walter J. Boyne]], a former [[B-52]] pilot with the [[Strategic Air Command]], became director of the National Air and Space Museum, and he made the ''Enola Gay''{{'}}s restoration a priority.<ref name=\"An Exhibit Denied\" /> Looking at the aircraft, Tibbets recalled, was a \"sad meeting.

It is common in [[particle physics]], where units of mass and energy are often interchanged, to express mass in units of eV/''c''<sup>2</sup>, where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum (from [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|{{nowrap|1=''E'' = ''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}]]). It is common to simply express mass in terms of \"eV\" as a [[unit of mass]], effectively using a system of [[natural units]] with ''c'' set to 1.<ref>Barrow, J. D. \"Natural Units Before Planck.\" Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society 24 (1983): 24.</ref> The mass equivalent of {{val|1|u=eV/c2}} is\n\n:<math>1\\; \\text{eV}/c^{2} = \\frac{(1.60217646 \\times 10^{-19} \\; \\text{C}) \\cdot 1 \\; \\text{V}}{(2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\; \\text{m}/\\text{s})^2} = 1.783 \\times 10^{-36}\\; \\text{kg}.</math>\n\nFor example, an electron and a [[positron]], each with a mass of {{val|0.511|u=MeV/c2}}, can [[Annihilation|annihilate]] to yield {{val|1.022|u=MeV}} of energy. The [[proton]] has a mass of {{val|0.938|u=GeV/c2}}. In general, the masses of all [[hadron]]s are of the order of {{val|1|u=GeV/c2}}, which makes the GeV (gigaelectronvolt) a convenient unit of mass for particle physics:\n:{{val|1|u=GeV/c2}}&nbsp;= {{val|1.783|e=-27|u=kg}}.\n\nThe [[unified atomic mass unit]] (u), 1&nbsp;gram divided by [[Avogadro's number]], is almost the mass of a [[hydrogen atom]], which is mostly the mass of the proton. To convert to megaelectronvolts, use the formula:\n\n:1&nbsp;u&nbsp;= {{val|931.4941|u=MeV/c2}}&nbsp;= {{val|0.9314941|u=GeV/c2}}.\n\n==Momentum==\nIn [[Particle physics|high-energy physics]], the electronvolt is often used as a unit of [[momentum]]. A potential difference of 1&nbsp;volt causes an electron to gain an amount of energy (i.e., {{val|1|u=eV}}). This gives rise to usage of eV (and keV, MeV, GeV or TeV) as units of momentum, for the energy supplied results in acceleration of the particle.\n\nThe dimensions of momentum units are {{dimanalysis|length=1|mass=1|time=\u22121}}. The dimensions of energy units are {{dimanalysis|length=2|mass=1|time=\u22122}}. Then, dividing the units of energy (such as eV) by a fundamental constant that has units of velocity ({{dimanalysis|length=1|time=\u22121}}), facilitates the required conversion of using energy units to describe momentum. In the field of high-energy particle physics, the fundamental velocity unit is the speed of light in vacuum ''c''. \n\n\nBy dividing energy in eV by the speed of light, one can describe the momentum of an electron in units of eV/''c''.<ref name=\"FNALunits\">{{cite web |url=http://quarknet.fnal.gov/toolkits/ati/whatgevs.html |title=Units in particle physics |publisher=Fermilab |date=22 March 2002 |work=Associate Teacher Institute Toolkit |accessdate=13 February 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514152552/http://quarknet.fnal.gov/toolkits/ati/whatgevs.html |archivedate=14 May 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"SLACunits\">{{cite web |url=http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/vvc/theory/relativity.html |title=Special Relativity |publisher=SLAC |date=15 June 2009 |work=Virtual Visitor Center |accessdate=13 February 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe fundamental velocity constant ''c'' is often ''dropped'' from the units of momentum by way of defining units of length such that the value of ''c'' is unity. For example, if the momentum ''p'' of an electron is said to be {{val|1|u=GeV}}, then the conversion to MKS can be achieved by:\n\n:<math>p = 1\\; \\text{GeV}/c = \\frac{(1 \\times 10^{9}) \\cdot (1.60217646 \\times 10^{-19} \\; \\text{C}) \\cdot (1 \\; \\text{V})}{(2.99792458 \\times 10^{8}\\; \\text{m}/\\text{s})} = 5.344286 \\times 10^{-19}\\; \\text{kg} \\cdot \\text{m}/\\text{s}.</math>\n\n==Distance==\nIn [[particle physics]], a system of \"natural units\" in which the speed of light in vacuum ''c'' and the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]] ''\u0127'' are dimensionless and equal to unity is widely used: {{nowrap|1=''c'' = ''\u0127'' = 1}}. In these units, both distances and times are expressed in inverse energy units (while energy and mass are expressed in the same units, see [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]]). In particular, particle [[scattering length]]s are often presented in units of inverse particle masses.\n\nOutside this system of units, the conversion factors between electronvolt, second, and nanometer are the following:\n:<math>\\hbar = {{h}\\over{2\\pi}} = 1.054\\ 571\\ 726(47)\\times 10^{-34}\\ \\mbox{J s} = 6.582\\ 119\\ 28(15)\\times 10^{-16}\\ \\mbox{eV s}.</math>\n\nThe above relations also allow expressing the [[mean lifetime]] ''\u03c4'' of an unstable particle (in seconds) in terms of its [[decay width]] ''\u0393'' (in eV) via {{nowrap|1=''\u0393'' = ''\u0127''/''\u03c4''}}. For example, the [[B meson|B<sup>0</sup> meson]] has a lifetime of 1.530(9)&nbsp;[[picosecond]]s, mean decay length is {{nowrap|1=''c\u03c4'' = {{val|459.7|u=\u00b5m}}}}, or a decay width of {{val|4.302|25|e=-4|u=eV}}.\n\nConversely, the tiny meson mass differences responsible for [[Neutral particle oscillation|meson oscillations]] are often expressed in the more convenient inverse picoseconds.\n\nEnergy in electronvolts is sometimes expressed through the wavelength of light with photons of the same energy: 1 eV = 8065.544005(49) cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. <!-- calculation 1/hc -->\n\n==Temperature==\nIn certain fields, such as [[plasma physics]], it is convenient to use the electronvolt as a unit of temperature. The conversion to the [[Kelvin scale]] is defined by using ''k''<sub>B</sub>, the [[Boltzmann constant]]:\n\n:<math>{1 \\over k_{\\text{B}}} = {1.602\\,176\\,53(14) \\times 10^{-19} \\text{ J/eV} \\over 1.380\\,6505(24) \\times 10^{-23} \\text{ J/K}} = 11\\,604.505(20) \\text{ K/eV}.</math>\n\nFor example, a typical [[magnetic confinement fusion]] plasma is {{val|15|u=keV}}, or 170&nbsp;MK.\n\nAs an approximation: ''k''<sub>B</sub>''T'' is about {{val|0.025|u=eV}} (\u2248 {{sfrac|290 K|11604 K/eV}}) at a temperature of {{val|20|u=degC}}.\n\n==Properties==\n[[File:Colors in eV.svg|thumb|Energy of photons in the visible spectrum in eV|239x239px]]\n[[File:EV to nm vis.png|thumb|Graph of wavelength (nm) to energy (eV)]]\nThe energy ''E'', frequency ''v'', and wavelength \u03bb of a photon are related by\n\n:<math>E=h\\nu=\\frac{hc}{\\lambda}</math> <math>=\\frac{(4.13566\\,7516\\times 10^{-15}\\,\\mbox{eV}\\,\\mbox{s})(299\\,792\\,458\\,\\mbox{m/s})}{\\lambda}</math>\n\nwhere ''h'' is the [[Planck constant]], ''c'' is the [[speed of light]].

For example, the yield of a [[phototube]] is measured in phe/keVee ([[photoelectron]]s per keV electron-equivalent energy). The relationship between eV, eVr, and eVee depends on the medium the scattering takes place in, and must be established empirically for each material.\n\n==Energy comparisons==\n[[File:Light spectrum.svg|right|frame|'''Photon frequency vs. energy particle in electronvolts'''.

It refers to electrochemical processes involving [[electron]] transfer to or from a [[molecule]] or [[ion]] changing its [[oxidation state]]. This reaction can occur through the application of an external [[voltage]] or through the release of chemical energy. Oxidation and reduction describe the change of oxidation state that takes place in the atoms, ions or molecules involved in an electrochemical reaction. Formally, oxidation state is the hypothetical [[Electric charge|charge]] that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% [[Ionic bond|ionic]]. An atom or ion that gives up an electron to another atom or ion has its oxidation state increase, and the recipient of the negatively charged electron has its oxidation state decrease.\n\nFor example, when atomic [[sodium]] reacts with atomic [[chlorine]], sodium donates one electron and attains an oxidation state of +1. Chlorine accepts the electron and its oxidation state is reduced to \u22121. The sign of the oxidation state (positive/negative) actually corresponds to the value of each ion's electronic charge. The attraction of the differently charged sodium and chlorine ions is the reason they then form an [[ionic bond]].\n\nThe loss of electrons from an atom or molecule is called oxidation, and the gain of electrons is reduction. This can be easily remembered through the use of [[mnemonic]] devices. Two of the most popular are ''\"OIL RIG\"'' (Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain) and ''\"LEO\"'' the lion says ''\"GER\"'' (Lose Electrons: Oxidation, Gain Electrons: Reduction).  Oxidation and reduction always occur in a paired fashion such that one species is oxidized when another is reduced. For cases where electrons are shared (covalent bonds) between atoms with large differences in [[electronegativity]], the electron is assigned to the atom with the largest electronegativity in determining the oxidation state.\n\nThe atom or molecule which loses electrons is known as the ''[[reducing agent]]'', or ''reductant'', and the substance which accepts the electrons is called the ''[[oxidizing agent]]'', or ''oxidant''. Thus, the oxidizing agent is always being reduced in a reaction; the reducing agent is always being oxidized. Oxygen is a common oxidizing agent, but not the only one. Despite the name, an oxidation reaction does not necessarily need to involve oxygen. In fact, a [[fire]] can be fed by an oxidant other than oxygen; [[fluorine]] fires are often unquenchable, as fluorine is an even stronger oxidant (it has a higher [[electronegativity]] and thus accepts electrons even better) than oxygen.\n\nFor reactions involving oxygen, the gain of oxygen implies the oxidation of the atom or molecule to which the oxygen is added (and the oxygen is reduced). In organic compounds, such as [[butane]] or [[ethanol]], the loss of hydrogen implies oxidation of the molecule from which it is lost (and the hydrogen is reduced). This follows because the hydrogen donates its electron in covalent bonds with non-metals but it takes the electron along when it is lost. Conversely, loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen implies reduction.\n\n===Balancing redox reactions===\n{{Main article|Chemical equation}}\nElectrochemical reactions in water are better understood by balancing redox reactions using the [[ion-electron method]] where [[hydronium|H<sup>+</sup>]], [[Hydroxide|OH<sup>\u2212</sup>]] ion, [[Water (molecule)|H<sub>2</sub>O]] and electrons (to compensate the oxidation changes) are added to cell's [[half-reaction]]s for oxidation and reduction.\n\n====Acidic medium====\nIn acid medium [[hydronium|H<sup>+</sup>]] ions and water are added to [[half-reaction]]s to balance the overall reaction.\nFor example, when [[manganese]] reacts with [[sodium bismuthate]].\n:''Unbalanced reaction'': Mn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + NaBiO<sub>3(s)</sub> \u2192 Bi<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n:''Oxidation'': 4 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + Mn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 8 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 5 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:''Reduction'': 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> + 6 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + BiO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(s)</sub> \u2192 Bi<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n\nFinally, the reaction is balanced by [[multiplication|multiplying]] the number of electrons from the reduction half reaction to oxidation half reaction and vice versa and adding both half reactions, thus solving the equation.\n:8 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + 2 Mn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 2 MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 16 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 10 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:10 e<sup>\u2212</sup> + 30 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 5 BiO<sub>3</sub><sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(s)</sub> \u2192 5 Bi<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 15 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\nReaction balanced:\n:14 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 Mn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 5 NaBiO<sub>3(s)</sub> \u2192 7 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + 2 MnO<sub>4</sub><sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 5 Bi<sup>3+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 5 Na<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\n====Basic medium====\nIn basic medium [[Hydroxide|OH<sup>\u2212</sup>]] ions and [[Water (molecule)|water]] are added to half reactions to balance the overall reaction.

This kind of cell includes the [[Galvanic cell]] or Voltaic cell, named after [[Luigi Galvani]] and [[Alessandro Volta]], both scientists who conducted several experiments on chemical reactions and electric current during the late 18th century.\n\nElectrochemical cells have two conductive electrodes (the anode and the cathode). The [[anode]] is defined as the electrode where oxidation occurs and the [[cathode]] is the electrode where the reduction takes place. Electrodes can be made from any sufficiently conductive materials, such as metals, semiconductors, graphite, and even [[conductive and electric polymer]]s. In between these electrodes is the [[electrolyte]], which contains ions that can freely move.\n\nThe galvanic cell uses two different metal electrodes, each in an electrolyte where the positively charged ions are the oxidized form of the electrode metal. One electrode will undergo oxidation (the anode) and the other will undergo reduction (the cathode). The metal of the anode will oxidize, going from an oxidation state of 0 (in the solid form) to a positive oxidation state and become an ion. At the cathode, the metal ion in solution will accept one or more electrons from the cathode and the ion's oxidation state is reduced to 0. This forms a solid metal that [[electroplating|electrodeposits]] on the cathode. The two electrodes must be electrically connected to each other, allowing for a flow of electrons that leave the metal of the anode and flow through this connection to the ions at the surface of the cathode. This flow of electrons is an electric current that can be used to do work, such as turn a motor or power a light.\n\nA galvanic cell whose [[electrode]]s are [[zinc]] and [[copper]] submerged in [[zinc sulfate]] and [[copper sulfate]], respectively, is known as a [[Daniell cell]].<ref name=w215/>\n\nHalf reactions for a Daniell cell are these:<ref name=w215/>\n:Zinc electrode (anode): Zn<sub>(s)</sub> \u2192 Zn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:Copper electrode (cathode): Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cu<sub>(s)</sub>\n\n[[File:BASi epsilon C3 cell stand.jpg|thumb|right|A modern cell stand for electrochemical research. The electrodes attach to high-quality metallic wires, and the stand is attached to a [[potentiostat]]/[[galvanostat]] (not pictured). A [[shot glass]]-shaped container is [[Aerated water|aerated]] with a noble gas and sealed with the [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] block.]]\n\nIn this example, the anode is the zinc metal which is oxidized (loses electrons) to form zinc ions in solution, and copper ions accept electrons from the copper metal electrode and the ions deposit at the copper cathode as an electrodeposit. This cell forms a simple battery as it will spontaneously generate a flow of electric current from the anode to the cathode through the external connection. This reaction can be driven in reverse by applying a voltage, resulting in the deposition of zinc metal at the anode and formation of copper ions at the cathode.<ref name=w215/>\n\nTo provide a complete electric circuit, there must also be an ionic conduction path between the anode and cathode electrolytes in addition to the electron conduction path. The simplest ionic conduction path is to provide a liquid junction. To avoid mixing between the two electrolytes, the liquid junction can be provided through a porous plug that allows ion flow while reducing electrolyte mixing. To further minimize mixing of the electrolytes, a [[salt bridge]] can be used which consists of an electrolyte saturated gel in an inverted U-tube. As the negatively charged electrons flow in one direction around this circuit, the positively charged metal ions flow in the opposite direction in the electrolyte.\n\nA [[galvanometer|voltmeter]] is capable of measuring the change of [[Electric potential|electrical potential]] between the anode and the cathode.\n\nElectrochemical cell voltage is also referred to as [[electromotive force]] or emf.\n\nA cell diagram can be used to trace the path of the electrons in the electrochemical cell. For example, here is a cell diagram of a Daniell cell:\n:Zn<sub>(s)</sub> | Zn<sup>2+</sup> (1M) || Cu<sup>2+</sup> (1M) | Cu<sub>(s)</sub>\n\nFirst, the reduced form of the metal to be oxidized at the anode (Zn) is written. This is separated from its oxidized form by a vertical line, which represents the limit between the phases (oxidation changes). The double vertical lines represent the saline bridge on the cell. Finally, the oxidized form of the metal to be reduced at the cathode, is written, separated from its reduced form by the vertical line. The electrolyte concentration is given as it is an important variable in determining the cell potential.\n\n==Standard electrode potential==\n{{Main article|Standard electrode potential}}\n\nTo allow prediction of the cell potential, tabulations of [[standard electrode potential]] are available. Such tabulations are referenced to the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). The [[standard hydrogen electrode]] undergoes the reaction\n:2 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>\n\nwhich is shown as reduction but, in fact, the SHE can act as either the anode or the cathode, depending on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of the other electrode/electrolyte combination. The term standard in SHE requires a supply of hydrogen gas bubbled through the electrolyte at a pressure of 1 atm and an acidic electrolyte with H<sup>+</sup> activity equal to 1 (usually assumed to be [H<sup>+</sup>] = 1&nbsp;mol/liter).\n\nThe SHE electrode can be connected to any other electrode by a salt bridge to form a cell. If the second electrode is also at standard conditions, then the measured cell potential is called the standard electrode potential for the electrode. The standard electrode potential for the SHE is zero, by definition. The polarity of the standard electrode potential provides information about the relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the SHE. If the electrode has a positive potential with respect to the SHE, then that means it is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the SHE to be the anode (an example is Cu in aqueous CuSO<sub>4</sub> with a standard electrode potential of 0.337 V). Conversely, if the measured potential is negative, the electrode is more oxidizing than the SHE (such as Zn in ZnSO<sub>4</sub> where the standard electrode potential is \u22120.76 V).<ref name=w215>Wiberg, pp. 215\u2013216</ref>\n\nStandard electrode potentials are usually tabulated as reduction potentials. However, the reactions are reversible and the role of a particular electrode in a cell depends on the relative oxidation/reduction potential of both electrodes. The oxidation potential for a particular electrode is just the negative of the reduction potential. A standard cell potential can be determined by looking up the standard electrode potentials for both electrodes (sometimes called half cell potentials). The one that is smaller will be the anode and will undergo oxidation. The cell potential is then calculated as the sum of the reduction potential for the cathode and the oxidation potential for the anode.\n\n:E\u00b0<sub>cell</sub> = E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> (cathode) \u2013 E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> (anode) = E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> (cathode) + E\u00b0<sub>oxi</sub> (anode)\n\nFor example, the standard electrode potential for a copper electrode is:\n\n:''Cell diagram''\n:Pt<sub>(s)</sub> | H<sub>2</sub> (1 atm) | H<sup>+</sup> (1 M) || Cu<sup>2+</sup> (1 M) | Cu<sub>(s)</sub>\n:E\u00b0<sub>cell</sub> = E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> (cathode) \u2013 E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> (anode)\n\nAt standard temperature, pressure and concentration conditions, the cell's [[electromotive force|emf]] (measured by a [[multimeter]]) is 0.34 V. By definition, the electrode potential for the SHE is zero. Thus, the Cu is the cathode and the SHE is the anode giving\n:E<sub>cell</sub> = E\u00b0(Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Cu) \u2013 E\u00b0(H<sup>+</sup>/H<sub>2</sub>)\nOr,\n:E\u00b0(Cu<sup>2+</sup>/Cu) = 0.34 V\n\nChanges in the [[stoichiometric coefficient]]s of a balanced cell equation will not change E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> value because the standard electrode potential is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]].\n\n==Spontaneity of redox reaction==\n{{Main article|Spontaneous process}}\n\nDuring operation of [[electrochemical cell]]s, [[chemical energy]] is transformed into [[electrical energy]] and is expressed mathematically as the product of the cell's emf and the [[electric charge]] transferred through the external circuit.\n:Electrical energy = E<sub>cell</sub>C<sub>trans</sub>\n\nwhere E<sub>cell</sub> is the cell potential measured in volts (V) and C<sub>trans</sub> is the cell current integrated over time and measured in coulombs (C); C<sub>trans</sub> can also be determined by multiplying the total number of electrons transferred (measured in moles) times [[Faraday's constant]] (F).\n\nThe emf of the cell at zero current is the maximum possible emf. It is used to calculate the maximum possible electrical energy that could be obtained from a [[chemical reaction]]. This energy is referred to as [[electrical work]] and is expressed by the following equation:\n:<math>W_{max} = W_{electrical} = -nFE_{cell} </math>,\n\nwhere work is defined as positive into the system.\n\nSince the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is the maximum amount of work that can be extracted from a system, one can write:<ref name=s308>Swaddle, pp. 308\u2013314</ref>\n:<math>\\Delta G = -nFE_{cell} </math>\n\nA positive cell potential gives a negative change in Gibbs free energy. This is consistent with the cell production of an [[electric current]] from the cathode to the anode through the external circuit. If the current is driven in the opposite direction by imposing an external potential, then work is done on the cell to drive electrolysis.<ref name=s308/>\n\nA [[Spontaneous process|spontaneous]] electrochemical reaction (change in Gibbs free energy less than zero) can be used to generate an electric current in electrochemical cells. This is the basis of all batteries and [[fuel cell]]s. For example, gaseous oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and\nhydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) can be combined in a fuel cell to form water and energy, typically a combination of heat and electrical energy.<ref name=s308/>\n\nConversely, non-spontaneous electrochemical reactions can be driven forward by the application of a current at sufficient [[voltage]]. The [[electrolysis]] of water into gaseous oxygen and hydrogen is a typical example.\n\nThe relation between the [[equilibrium constant]], ''K'', and the Gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell is expressed as follows:\n:<math>\\Delta G^\\circ = -RT \\ln K = -nFE^{\\circ}_{cell} </math>.\n\nRearranging to express the relation between standard potential and equilibrium constant yields\n:<math>E^{o}_{cell} = \\frac{RT}{nF}\\ln K</math>.\n\nThe previous equation can use [[Briggsian logarithm]] as shown below:\n:<math>E^{o}_{cell} = \\frac{0.0591 \\,\\mathrm{V}}{n} \\log K</math>\n\n==Cell emf dependency on changes in concentration==\n\n===Nernst equation===\n{{Main article|Nernst equation}}\n\nThe standard potential of an electrochemical cell requires standard conditions (\u0394G\u00b0) for all of the reactants. When reactant concentrations differ from standard conditions, the cell potential will deviate from the standard potential. In the 20th century German [[chemist]] [[Walther Nernst]] proposed a mathematical model to determine the effect of reactant concentration on electrochemical cell potential.\n\nIn the late 19th century, [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] had formulated a theory to predict whether a chemical reaction is spontaneous based on the free energy\n:<math>\\Delta G = \\Delta G^\\circ + RT \\ln Q </math>\n\nHere ''\u0394G'' is change in [[Gibbs free energy]], ''\u0394G\u00b0'' is the cell potential when ''Q'' is equal to 1, ''T'' is absolute [[temperature]](Kelvin), ''R'' is the [[gas constant]] and ''Q'' is [[reaction quotient]] which can be found by dividing products by reactants using only those products and reactants that are aqueous or gaseous.\n\nGibbs' key contribution was to formalize the understanding of the effect of reactant concentration on spontaneity.\n\nBased on Gibbs' work, Nernst extended the theory to include the contribution from electric potential on charged species. As shown in the previous section, the change in Gibbs free energy for an electrochemical cell can be related to the cell potential. Thus, Gibbs' theory becomes\n:<math>nF\\Delta E = nF\\Delta E^\\circ - RT \\ln Q</math>\n\nHere ''n'' is the number of [[electron]]s/[[Mole (unit)|mole]] product, ''F'' is the [[Faraday constant]] ([[coulomb]]s/[[Mole (unit)|mole]]), and ''\u0394E'' is [[Electrode potential|cell potential]].\n\nFinally, Nernst divided through by the amount of charge transferred to arrive at a new equation which now bears his name:\n:<math>\\Delta E = \\Delta E^\\circ - \\frac{RT}{nF} \\ln Q </math>\n\nAssuming standard conditions (T = 25&nbsp;\u00b0C) and [[Universal gas constant|R]] = 8.3145 J/(K\u00b7mol), the equation above can be expressed on [[Common logarithm|base\u201410 logarithm]] as shown below:<ref name=w210>Wiberg, pp. 210\u2013212</ref>\n:<math>\\Delta E = \\Delta E^\\circ- \\frac{0.05916 \\,\\mathrm{V}}{n} \\log Q </math>\n\n===Concentration cells===\n{{Main article|Concentration cell}}\nA concentration cell is an electrochemical cell where the two electrodes are the same material, the electrolytes on the two half-cells involve the same ions, but the electrolyte concentration differs between the two half-cells.\n\nAn example is an electrochemical cell, where two copper electrodes are submerged in two [[copper(II) sulfate]] solutions, whose concentrations are 0.05 [[Molar concentration|M]] and 2.0 [[Molar concentration|M]], connected through a salt bridge. This type of cell will generate a potential that can be predicted by the Nernst equation. Both can undergo the same chemistry (although the reaction proceeds in reverse at the anode)\n:Cu<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cu<sub>(s)</sub>\n\n[[Le Chatelier's principle]] indicates that the reaction is more favorable to reduction as the concentration of Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions increases. Reduction will take place in the cell's compartment where concentration is higher and oxidation will occur on the more dilute side.\n\nThe following cell diagram describes the cell mentioned above:\n:Cu<sub>(s)</sub> | Cu<sup>2+</sup> (0.05 M) || Cu<sup>2+</sup> (2.0 M) | Cu<sub>(s)</sub>\n\nWhere the half cell reactions for oxidation and reduction are:\n:Oxidation: Cu<sub>(s)</sub> \u2192 Cu<sup>2+</sup> (0.05 M) + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:Reduction: Cu<sup>2+</sup> (2.0 M) + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cu<sub>(s)</sub>\n:Overall reaction: Cu<sup>2+</sup> (2.0 M) \u2192 Cu<sup>2+</sup> (0.05 M)\n\nThe cell's emf is calculated through Nernst equation as follows:\n:<math>E = E^\\circ - \\frac{0.05916 \\,\\mathrm{V}}{2} \\log \\frac{[\\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}]_{diluted}}{[\\mathrm{Cu^{2+}}]_{concentrated}} </math>\n\nThe value of ''E''\u00b0 in this kind of cell is zero, as electrodes and ions are the same in both half-cells.\n\nAfter replacing values from the case mentioned, it is possible to calculate cell's potential:\n:<math>E = 0 - \\frac{0.05916 \\,\\mathrm{V}}{2} \\log \\frac{0.05}{2.0} = 0.0474\\,\\mathrm{V} </math>\n\nor by:\n:<math>E = 0 - \\frac{0.0257 \\,\\mathrm{V}}{2} \\ln \\frac{0.05}{2.0}= 0.0474\\,\\mathrm{V} </math>\n\nHowever, this value is only approximate, as reaction quotient is defined in terms of ion activities which can be approximated with the concentrations as calculated here.\n\nThe Nernst equation plays an important role in understanding electrical effects in cells and organelles. Such effects include nerve [[synapses]] and [[cardiac cycle|cardiac beat]] as well as the resting potential of a somatic cell.\n\n==Battery==\n{{Main article|Battery (electricity)}}\n\nMany types of battery have been commercialized and represent an important practical application of electrochemistry.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P.

The zinc-manganese dioxide [[dry cell]] was the first portable, non-spillable battery type that made [[flashlight]]s and other portable devices practical.  The [[mercury battery]] using zinc and mercuric oxide provided higher levels of power and capacity than the original dry cell for early electronic devices, but has been phased out of common use due to the danger of mercury pollution from discarded cells.\n\nThe [[lead\u2013acid battery]] was the first practical secondary (rechargeable) battery that could have its capacity replenished from an external source. The electrochemical reaction that produced current was (to a useful degree) reversible, allowing electrical energy and chemical energy to be interchanged as needed. Common lead acid batteries contain a mixture of acid and water, as well as lead plates. The most common mixture used today is 30% acid. One problem however is if left uncharged acid will crystallize within the lead plates of the battery rendering it useless. These batteries last an average of 3 years with daily use however it is not unheard of for a lead acid battery to still be functional after 7\u201310 years. Lead-acid cells continue to be widely used in automobiles.\n\nAll the preceding types have water-based electrolytes, which limits the maximum voltage per cell. The freezing of water limits low temperature performance. The [[lithium battery]], which does not (and cannot) use water in the electrolyte, provides improved performance over other types; a rechargeable [[lithium-ion battery]] is an essential part of many mobile devices.\n\nThe [[flow battery]], an experimental type, offers the option of vastly larger energy capacity because its reactants can be replenished from external reservoirs.  The [[fuel cell]] can turn the chemical energy bound in hydrocarbon gases or hydrogen directly into electrical energy with much higher efficiency than any combustion process; such devices have powered many spacecraft and are being applied to [[grid energy storage]] for the public power system.\n\n==Corrosion==\n{{Main article|Corrosion}}\n\nCorrosion is an electrochemical process, which reveals itself in [[rust]] or tarnish on metals like [[iron]] or [[copper]] and their respective alloys, [[steel]] and [[brass]].\n\n===Iron corrosion===\nFor iron rust to occur the metal has to be in contact with [[oxygen]] and [[water]], although [[chemical reaction]]s for this process are relatively complex and not all of them are completely understood. It is believed the causes are the following:\nElectron transfer (reduction-oxidation)\n:One area on the surface of the metal acts as the anode, which is where the oxidation (corrosion) occurs. At the anode, the metal gives up electrons.\n::Fe<sub>(s)</sub> \u2192 Fe<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:[[Electron]]s are transferred from [[iron]], reducing oxygen in the [[atmosphere]] into [[water (molecule)|water]] on the cathode, which is placed in another region of the metal.\n::O<sub>2(g)</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 4 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n:Global reaction for the process:\n::2 Fe<sub>(s)</sub> + O<sub>2(g)</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 2 Fe<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n:Standard emf for iron rusting:\n::E\u00b0 = E\u00b0 (cathode) \u2013 E\u00b0 (anode)\n::E\u00b0 = 1.23V \u2013 (\u22120.44 V) = 1.67 V\n\nIron corrosion takes place in an acid medium; [[hydronium|H<sup>+</sup>]] [[ion]]s come from reaction between [[carbon dioxide]] in the atmosphere and water, forming [[carbonic acid]]. Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions oxidizes, following this equation:\n: <chem>4Fe^2+_{(aq)}{} + O2_{(g)}{} + (4+2\\mathit{x})H2O_{(l)} -> 2Fe2O3.\\mathit{x}H2O{} + 8H+_{(aq)}</chem>\n[[Iron(III) oxide]] [[hydrate]] is known as rust. The concentration of water associated with iron oxide varies, thus the chemical formula is represented by <chem>2Fe2O3.\\mathit{x}H2O</chem>.\n\nAn [[electric circuit]] is formed as passage of electrons and ions occurs, thus if an electrolyte is present it will facilitate [[oxidation]], explaining why rusting is quicker in [[brine|salt water]].\n\n===Corrosion of common metals===\n[[Coinage metal]]s, such as copper and silver, slowly corrode through use.\nA [[patina]] of green-blue [[Basic copper carbonate|copper carbonate]] forms on the surface of [[copper]] with exposure to the water and carbon dioxide in the air. [[Silver]] coins or [[cutlery]] that are exposed to high sulfur foods such as [[Egg (food)|egg]]s or the low levels of sulfur species in the air develop a layer of black [[Silver sulfide]].\n\n[[Gold]] and [[platinum]] are extremely difficult to oxidize under normal circumstances, and require exposure to a powerful chemical oxidizing agent such as [[aqua regia]].\n\nSome common metals oxidize extremely rapidly in air. [[Titanium]] and aluminium oxidize instantaneously in contact with the oxygen in the air. These metals form an extremely thin layer of oxidized metal on the surface which bonds with the underlying metal. This thin layer of oxide protects the underlying layers of the metal from the air preventing the entire metal from oxidizing. These metals are used in applications where corrosion resistance is important. [[Iron]], in contrast, has an oxide that forms in air and water, called [[rust]], that does not bond with the iron and therefore does not stop the further oxidation of the iron. Thus iron left exposed to air and water will continue to rust until all of the iron is oxided.\n\n===Prevention of corrosion===\nAttempts to save a metal from becoming anodic are of two general types. Anodic regions dissolve and destroy the structural integrity of the metal.\n\nWhile it is almost impossible to prevent anode/[[cathode]] formation, if a [[Insulator (electrical)|non-conducting]] material covers the metal, contact with the [[electrolyte]] is not possible and corrosion will not occur.\n\n====Coating====\nMetals can be coated with [[paint]] or other less conductive metals (''[[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]]''). This prevents the metal surface from being exposed to [[electrolyte]]s. Scratches exposing the metal substrate will result in corrosion. The region under the coating adjacent to the scratch acts as the [[anode]] of the reaction.\n\nSee [[Anodizing]]\n\n====Sacrificial anodes====\n{{Main article|Sacrificial anode}}\nA method commonly used to protect a structural metal is to attach a metal which is more anodic than the metal to be protected. This forces the structural metal to be [[cathodic]], thus spared corrosion. It is called ''\"sacrificial\"'' because the anode dissolves and has to be replaced periodically.\n\n[[Zinc]] bars are attached to various locations on steel [[ship]] [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] to render the ship hull [[cathode|cathodic]]. The zinc bars are replaced periodically. Other metals, such as [[magnesium]], would work very well but zinc is the least expensive useful metal.\n\nTo protect pipelines, an ingot of buried or exposed magnesium (or zinc) is buried beside the [[Pipe (material)|pipeline]] and is [[wire|connected electrically]] to the pipe above ground. The pipeline is forced to be a cathode and is protected from being oxidized and rusting. The magnesium anode is sacrificed. At intervals new [[ingot]]s are buried to replace those lost.\n\n==Electrolysis==\n{{Main article|Electrolysis}}\n\nThe spontaneous redox reactions of a conventional battery produce electricity through the different chemical potentials of the cathode and anode in the electrolyte. However, electrolysis requires an external source of [[electrical energy]] to induce a chemical reaction, and this process takes place in a compartment called an [[electrolytic cell]].\n\n===Electrolysis of molten sodium chloride===\nWhen molten, the salt [[sodium chloride]] can be electrolyzed to yield metallic [[sodium]] and gaseous [[chlorine]]. Industrially this process takes place in a special cell named Down's cell. The cell is connected to an electrical power supply, allowing [[electron]]s to migrate from the power supply to the electrolytic cell.<ref name=e800>Ebbing, pp. 800\u2013801</ref>\n\nReactions that take place at Down's cell are the following:<ref name=e800/>\n:Anode (oxidation): 2 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Cl<sub>2(g)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:Cathode (reduction): 2 Na<sup>+</sup><sub>(l)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 2 Na<sub>(l)</sub>\n:Overall reaction: 2 Na<sup>+</sup> + 2 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(l)</sub> \u2192 2 Na<sub>(l)</sub> + Cl<sub>2(g)</sub>\n\nThis process can yield large amounts of metallic sodium and gaseous chlorine, and is widely used on [[mineral dressing]] and [[metallurgy]] [[industry|industries]].\n\nThe [[Electromotive force|emf]] for this process is approximately \u22124 [[Volt|V]] indicating a (very) non-spontaneous process. In order for this reaction to occur the power supply should provide at least a potential of 4 V. However, larger voltages must be used for this reaction to occur at a high rate.\n\n===Electrolysis of water===\n{{Main article|Electrolysis of water}}\nWater can be converted to its component elemental gasses, H<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> through the application of an external voltage. [[Water]] doesn't decompose into [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] [[Spontaneous process|spontaneously]] as the [[Gibbs free energy]] for the process at standard conditions is about 474.4 kJ. The decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen can be performed in an electrolytic cell. In it, a pair of inert [[electrode]]s usually made of [[platinum]] immersed in water act as anode and cathode in the electrolytic process. The electrolysis starts with the application of an external voltage between the electrodes. This process will not occur except at extremely high voltages without an electrolyte such as [[sodium chloride]] or [[sulfuric acid]] (most used 0.1 [[Molar concentration|M]]).<ref name=w235/>\n\nBubbles from the gases will be seen near both electrodes. The following half reactions describe the process mentioned above:\n:Anode (oxidation): 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> \u2192 O<sub>2(g)</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 4 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:Cathode (reduction): 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(g)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2(g)</sub> + 2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n:Overall reaction: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> \u2192 2 H<sub>2(g)</sub> + O<sub>2(g)</sub>\n\nAlthough strong acids may be used in the apparatus, the reaction will not net consume the acid. While this reaction will work at any conductive electrode at a sufficiently large potential, platinum [[catalysis|catalyzes]] both hydrogen and oxygen formation, allowing for relatively mild voltages (~2 V depending on the [[pH]]).<ref name=w235>Wiberg, pp. 235\u2013239</ref>\n\n===Electrolysis of aqueous solutions===\nElectrolysis in an aqueous solution is a similar process as mentioned in electrolysis of water. However, it is considered to be a complex process because the contents in solution have to be analyzed in [[chemical reaction|half reactions]], whether reduced or oxidized.\n\n====Electrolysis of a solution of sodium chloride====\nThe presence of water in a solution of [[sodium chloride]] must be examined in respect to its reduction and oxidation in both electrodes. Usually, water is electrolysed as mentioned in electrolysis of water yielding ''gaseous [[oxygen]] in the anode'' and gaseous [[hydrogen]] in the cathode. On the other hand, sodium chloride in water [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociates]] in Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> ions, [[cation]], which is the positive ion, will be attracted to the cathode (-), thus reducing the [[sodium]] ion. The [[anion]] will then be attracted to the anode (+) oxidizing [[chloride]] ion.<ref name=nacl>Ebbing, pp. 837\u2013839</ref>\n\nThe following half reactions describes the process mentioned:<ref name=nacl/>\n:1. Cathode: Na<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 Na<sub>(s)</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> = \u20132.71 V\n:2. Anode: 2 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 Cl<sub>2(g)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> = +1.36 V\n:3. Cathode: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2(g)</sub> + 2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> = \u20130.83 V\n:4. Anode: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> \u2192 O<sub>2(g)</sub> + 4 H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 4 e<sup>\u2212</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E\u00b0<sub>red</sub> = +1.23 V\n\nReaction 1 is discarded as it has the most [[Negative number|negative]] value on standard reduction potential thus making it less thermodynamically favorable in the process.\n\nWhen comparing the reduction potentials in reactions 2 and 4, the reduction of chloride ion is favored. Thus, if the Cl<sup>\u2212</sup> ion is favored for [[redox|reduction]], then the water reaction is favored for [[oxidation]] producing gaseous oxygen, however experiments show gaseous chlorine is produced and not oxygen.\n\nAlthough the initial analysis is correct, there is another effect that can happen, known as the [[Overvoltage|overvoltage effect]]. Additional voltage is sometimes required, beyond the voltage predicted by the E\u00b0<sub>cell</sub>. This may be due to [[chemical kinetics|kinetic]] rather than [[Thermochemistry|thermodynamic]] considerations. In fact, it has been proven that the [[activation energy]] for the chloride ion is very low, hence favorable in [[chemical kinetics|kinetic terms]]. In other words, although the voltage applied is thermodynamically sufficient to drive electrolysis, the rate is so slow that to make the process proceed in a reasonable time frame, the [[voltage]] of the external source has to be increased (hence, overvoltage).<ref name=nacl/>\n\nFinally, reaction 3 is favorable because it describes the proliferation of [[hydroxide|OH<sup>\u2212</sup>]] ions thus letting a probable reduction of [[hydronium|H<sup>+</sup>]] ions less favorable an option.\n\nThe overall reaction for the process according to the analysis would be the following:<ref name=nacl/>\n:Anode (oxidation): 2 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 Cl<sub>2(g)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup>\n:Cathode (reduction): 2 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + 2 e<sup>\u2212</sup> \u2192 H<sub>2(g)</sub> + 2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n:Overall reaction: 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + 2 Cl<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2(g)</sub> + Cl<sub>2(g)</sub> + 2 OH<sup>\u2212</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nAs the overall reaction indicates, the [[concentration]] of chloride ions is reduced in comparison to OH<sup>\u2212</sup> ions (whose concentration increases). The reaction also shows the production of gaseous [[hydrogen]], [[chlorine]] and aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]].\n\n===Quantitative electrolysis and Faraday's laws===\n{{Main article|Faraday's law of electrolysis}}\nQuantitative aspects of electrolysis were originally developed by [[Michael Faraday]] in 1834. Faraday is also credited to have coined the terms ''[[electrolyte]]'', electrolysis, among many others while he studied quantitative analysis of electrochemical reactions. Also he was an advocate of the [[law of conservation of energy]].\n\n====First law====\nFaraday concluded after several experiments on [[electric current]] in [[spontaneous process|non-spontaneous process]], the [[mass]] of the products yielded on the electrodes was proportional to the value of current supplied to the cell, the length of time the current existed, and the molar mass of the substance analyzed. In other words, the amount of a substance deposited on each electrode of an electrolytic cell is directly proportional to the [[Electric charge|quantity of electricity]] passed through the cell.<ref>Wiberg, p. 65</ref>\n\nBelow is a simplified equation of Faraday's first law:\n:<math>m = \\frac{1}{96485 \\mathrm{(C\\cdot mol^{-1})}} \\cdot \\frac{QM}{n} </math>\n\nWhere\n:''m'' is the mass of the substance produced at the electrode (in [[gram]]s),\n:''Q'' is the total electric charge that passed through the solution (in [[coulomb]]s),\n:''n'' is the valence number of the substance as an ion in solution (electrons per ion),\n:''M'' is the molar mass of the substance (in grams per [[mole (unit)|mole]]).\n\n====Second law====\n{{Main article|Electroplating}}\nFaraday devised the laws of chemical electrodeposition of metals from solutions in 1857. He formulated the second law of electrolysis stating ''\"the amounts of bodies which are equivalent to each other in their ordinary chemical action have equal quantities of electricity naturally associated with them.\"'' In other words, the quantities of different elements deposited by a given amount of electricity are in the [[ratio]] of their chemical [[equivalent weight]]s.<ref>[http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Faraday.html Faraday, Michael (1791\u20131867)], Wolfram Research</ref>\n\nAn important aspect of the second law of electrolysis is [[electroplating]] which together with the first law of electrolysis, has a significant number of applications in the industry, as when used to protect [[metal]]s to avoid [[corrosion]].\n\n==Applications==\n<!--- calling photosynthetic energy generation or oxidative phosphorylation electrochemical strikes me as a bit of a reach.

The generation of chemical energy through [[photosynthesis]] is inherently an electrochemical process, as is production of metals like aluminum and titanium from their ores. Certain diabetes blood sugar meters measure the amount of glucose in the blood through its redox potential. As well as the established electrochemical technologies (like deep cycle lead acid batteries) there is also a wide range of new emerging technologies such as fuel cells, large format lithium-ion batteries, electrochemical reactors and super-capacitors that are becoming increasingly commercial.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=S.P.S BADWAL |author2=S.

The earliest comparison between the two cities showed that they had a similar topography, with the [[Castle Rock (Edinburgh)|Castle Rock]] of Edinburgh performing a similar role to the [[Athens|Athenian]] [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]]. Both of them had flatter, fertile agricultural land sloping down to a [[port]] several miles away (respectively [[Leith]] and [[Piraeus]]). Although this arrangement is common in [[Southern Europe]], it is rare in [[Northern Europe]]. The 18th-century intellectual life, referred to as the [[Scottish Enlightenment]], was a key influence in gaining the name. Such luminaries as [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Smith]] shone during this period. Having lost most of its political importance after the [[Treaty of Union 1707|Union]], some hoped that Edinburgh could gain a similar influence on London as Athens had on Rome. Also a contributing factor was the later [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] architecture, particularly that of [[William Henry Playfair]], and the [[National Monument, Edinburgh|National Monument]]. [[Tom Stoppard]]'s character Archie, of [[Jumpers]], said, perhaps playing on [[Reykjav\u00edk]] meaning \"smoky bay\", that the \"Reykjav\u00edk of the South\" would be more appropriate.<ref>Stoppard, Tom. ''Jumpers'', Grove Press, 1972, p. 69.</ref>\n\nThe city has also been known by several Latin names, such as ''Aneda'' or ''Edina''.

J. Thomson]] on the conductive effects of X-rays on gases, work which led to the discovery of the [[electron]] which Thomson presented to the world in 1897. Hearing of [[Henri Becquerel|Becquerel]]'s experience with [[uranium]], Rutherford started to explore its [[radioactivity]], discovering two types that differed from X-rays in their penetrating power. Continuing his research in Canada, he coined the terms [[alpha ray]] and [[beta ray]] in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of [[radioactivity|radiation]]. He then discovered that [[thorium]] gave off a gas which produced an emanation which was itself radioactive and would coat other substances. He found that a sample of this radioactive material of any size invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay \u2013 its \"[[half-life]]\" (11\u00bd minutes in this case).\n\nFrom 1900 to 1903, he was joined at McGill by the young chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the thorium emanations. Once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, Soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named [[thoron]] (later found to be an isotope of [[radon]]). They also found another type of thorium they called Thorium X, and kept on finding traces of helium. They also worked with samples of \"Uranium X\" from [[William Crookes]] and [[radium]] from [[Marie Curie]].\n\nIn 1903, they published their \"Law of Radioactive Change,\" to account for all their experiments. Until then, atoms were assumed to be the indestructible basis of all matter and although Curie had suggested that radioactivity was an atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was a radically new idea. Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated that radioactivity involved the spontaneous disintegration of atoms into other, as yet, unidentified matter. [http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1908/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908] was awarded to Ernest Rutherford \"for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances\".\n\nIn 1903, Rutherford considered a type of radiation discovered (but not named) by French chemist [[Paul Villard]] in 1900, as an emission from [[radium]], and realised that this observation must represent something different from his own alpha and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power. Rutherford therefore gave this third type of radiation the name of [[gamma ray]]. All three of Rutherford's terms are in standard use today \u2013 other types of [[radioactive decay]] have since been discovered, but Rutherford's three types are among the most common.\n\nIn Manchester, he continued to work with alpha radiation. In conjunction with [[Hans Geiger]], he developed zinc sulfide [[zinc sulfide|scintillation screens]] and ionisation chambers to count alphas. By dividing the total charge they produced by the number counted, Rutherford decided that the charge on the alpha was two. In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and [[Thomas Royds]] allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube. As they [[atomic emission spectroscopy|sparked the tube into discharge]], the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube. Eventually, the clear spectrum of helium gas appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei.\n\n===Gold foil experiment===\n[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions.svg|right|thumb|''Top:'' Expected results: [[alpha particle]]s passing through the [[plum pudding model]] of the atom undisturbed.<br/>\n''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating [[Atomic nucleus|a small, concentrated charge]]. Note that the image is not to scale; in reality the nucleus is vastly smaller than the electron shell.]]\nRutherford performed his most famous work ''after'' receiving the Nobel prize in 1908. Along with [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] in 1909, he carried out the [[Geiger\u2013Marsden experiment]], which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting [[alpha particles]] passing through a thin gold foil. Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time. Such deflections, though rare, were found, and proved to be a smooth but high-order function of the deflection angle. It was Rutherford's interpretation of this data that led him to formulate the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom in 1911{{snd}}that a very small [[charge (physics)|charged]]<ref name=charge /> [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], containing much of the atom's mass, was [[orbit]]ed by low-mass [[electron]]s.\n\nIn 1919\u20131920, Rutherford found that nitrogen and other light elements ejected a proton (Rutherford said \"a hydrogen atom\" rather than \"a proton\") when hit with \u03b1 (alpha) particles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Atop the Physics Wave: Rutherford back in Cambridge, 1919\u20131937 |url=http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/rutherford/sections/atop-physics-wave.html |website=Rutherford's Nuclear World: The Story of the Discovery of the Nucleus |publisher=American Institute of Physics |accessdate=25 June 2018}}</ref> This result showed Rutherford that hydrogen nuclei were a part of nitrogen nuclei (and by inference, probably other nuclei as well). Such a construction had been suspected for many years on the basis of atomic weights which were whole numbers of that of hydrogen; see [[Prout's hypothesis]]. Hydrogen was known to be the lightest element, and its nuclei presumably the lightest nuclei. Now, because of all these considerations, Rutherford decided that a hydrogen nucleus was possibly a fundamental building block of all nuclei, and also possibly a new fundamental particle as well, since nothing was known from the nucleus that was lighter. Thus, confirming and extending the work of [[Wilhelm Wien]] who in 1898 discovered the proton in streams of [[ionized gas]],<ref>Wilhelm Wien: \u00dcber positive Elektronen und die Existenz hoher Atomgewichte. In: Annalen der Physik. Band 318 (4), 1904, S. 669\u2013677.</ref> Rutherford postulated the hydrogen nucleus to be a new particle in 1920, which he dubbed the ''[[proton]]''.\n\nIn 1921, while working with [[Niels Bohr]] (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits), Rutherford theorized about the existence of [[neutron]]s, (which he had christened in his 1920 [[Bakerian Lecture]]), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of [[proton]]s by causing an attractive [[nuclear force]] and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart from the repulsion between protons. The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of \"nuclear electrons\" which would counteract some of the proton charges in the nucleus, since by then it was known that nuclei had about twice the mass that could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei (protons). But how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus, was a mystery.\n\nRutherford's theory of [[neutron]]s was proved in 1932 by his associate [[James Chadwick]], who recognized neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. In 1935, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Sir Ernest Rutherford - Plaque at the University of Manchester.jpg|thumbnail|right|A plaque commemorating Rutherford's presence at the [[University of Manchester]]]]\n\n===Nuclear physics===\nRutherford's research, and work done under him as laboratory director, established the nuclear structure of the atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process. Patrick Blackett, a research fellow working under Rutherford, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated ''induced'' [[nuclear transmutation]]. Rutherford's team later, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated ''artificially-induced'' nuclear reactions and transmutation. He is known as the father of nuclear physics. Rutherford died too early to see [[Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd]]'s idea of controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]s come into being. However, a speech of Rutherford's about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed in 12 September 1933 London paper ''[[The Times]]'', was reported by Szil\u00e1rd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Szilard had this idea while walking in London, on the same day.\n\nRutherford's speech touched on the 1932 work of his students [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] in \"splitting\" lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford realized that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realized that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of light elements remains too inefficient to be used in this way, even today). Rutherford's speech in part, read:\n\n{{quote|We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.<ref>[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ The Times archives], 12 September 1933, \"The British association \u2013 breaking down the atom\"</ref>}}\n\n===Items named in honour of Rutherford's life and work===\n[[File:Statue of Ernest Rutherford.JPG|right|thumb|A statue of  a young Ernest Rutherford at his memorial in [[Brightwater|Brightwater, New Zealand]].]]\n; Scientific discoveries\n* The element [[rutherfordium]], Rf, Z=104.

He went on to assert that what the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation|equation]] that won him a Nobel prize seems to be describing is several different histories, they are \"not alternatives but all really happen simultaneously\".

Provided the theory is [[linear]] with respect to the wavefunction, the exact form of the [[quantum]] dynamics modelled, be it the non-relativistic [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], [[relativistic quantum field theory]] or some form of [[quantum gravity]] or [[string theory]], does not alter the validity of MWI since MWI is a [[metatheory]] applicable to all linear [[quantum mechanics|quantum theories]], and there is no experimental evidence for any non-linearity of the wavefunction in physics.<ref name=\"weinberglinearitydoft\"/><ref name=\"weinberglinearityannalsop\"/> MWI's main conclusion is that the universe (or [[multiverse]] in this context) is composed of a [[quantum superposition]] of very many, possibly even [[Uncountable set|non-denumerably]] [[Infinity|infinitely]]<ref name=\"Heresy\"/> many, increasingly divergent, non-communicating parallel universes or quantum worlds.<ref name=dewitt73/>\n\nThe idea of MWI originated in Everett's [[Princeton University|Princeton]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] thesis \"The Theory of the [[Universal Wavefunction]]\",<ref name=dewitt73/> developed under his thesis advisor [[John Archibald Wheeler]], a shorter summary of which was published in 1957 entitled \"Relative State Formulation of Quantum Mechanics\" (Wheeler contributed the title \"relative state\";<ref name=wheeler>[[John Archibald Wheeler]], ''Geons, Black Holes & Quantum Foam'', {{ISBN|0-393-31991-1}}. pp 268\u2013270</ref> Everett originally called his approach the \"Correlation Interpretation\", where \"correlation\" refers to [[quantum entanglement]]). The phrase \"many-worlds\" is due to [[Bryce DeWitt]],<ref name=dewitt73/> who was responsible for the wider popularisation of Everett's theory, which had been largely ignored for the first decade after publication. DeWitt's phrase \"many-worlds\" has become so much more popular than Everett's \"Universal Wavefunction\" or Everett\u2013Wheeler's \"Relative State Formulation\" that many forget that this is only a difference of terminology; the content of both of Everett's papers and DeWitt's popular article is the same.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation shares many similarities with later, other \"post-Everett\" interpretations of quantum mechanics which also use [[decoherence]] to explain the process of measurement or wavefunction collapse. MWI treats the other histories or worlds as real since it regards the universal wavefunction as the \"basic physical entity\"<ref name=\"reality wf57\">Everett 1957, section 3, 2nd paragraph, 1st sentence</ref> or \"the fundamental entity, obeying at all times a deterministic wave equation\".<ref name=\"reality wf73\">Everett [1956]1973, \"Theory of the Universal Wavefunction\", chapter 6 (e)</ref> The other decoherent interpretations, such as [[consistent histories]], the [[Existential Interpretation]] etc., either regard the extra quantum worlds as metaphorical in some sense, or are [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] about their reality; it is sometimes hard to distinguish between the different varieties. MWI is distinguished by two qualities: it assumes [[philosophical realism|realism]],<ref name=\"reality wf57\"/><ref name=\"reality wf73\"/> which it assigns to the wavefunction, and it has the minimal formal structure possible, rejecting any [[hidden variable theory|hidden variables]], [[quantum potential]], any form of a collapse postulate (i.e., [[Copenhagen Interpretation|Copenhagenism]]) or mental postulates (such as the [[many-minds interpretation]] makes).\n\nDecoherent interpretations of many-worlds using [[einselection]] to explain how a small number of classical [[pointer state]]s can emerge from the enormous [[Hilbert space]] of superpositions have been proposed by [[Wojciech H. Zurek]]. \"Under scrutiny of the environment, only pointer states remain unchanged. Other states decohere into mixtures of stable pointer states that can persist, and, in this sense, exist: They are einselected.\"<ref name=\"ZurekNature2009\">{{cite journal | last = Zurek | first = Wojciech | authorlink = Wojciech Hubert Zurek | title = Quantum Darwinism | date = March 2009 | arxiv = 0903.5082 |bibcode = 2009NatPh...5..181Z |doi = 10.1038/nphys1202 | volume=5 | issue=3 | journal=Nature Physics | pages=181\u2013188}}</ref> These ideas complement MWI and bring the interpretation in line with our perception of reality.\n\nMany-worlds is often referred to as a [[theory]], rather than just an interpretation, by those who propose that many-worlds can make testable predictions (such as [[David Deutsch]]) or is [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] (such as Everett) or by those who propose that all the other, non-MW interpretations, are inconsistent, illogical or unscientific in their handling of measurements; [[Hugh Everett]] argued that his formulation was a [[metatheory]], since it made statements about other interpretations of quantum theory; that it was the \"only completely coherent approach to explaining both the contents of quantum mechanics and the appearance of the world.\"<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/everett/ Everett<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Deutsch is dismissive that many-worlds is an \"interpretation\", saying that calling it an interpretation \"is like talking about dinosaurs as an 'interpretation' of fossil records.\"<ref name=\"MAD\"/>\n\n==Interpreting wavefunction collapse==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}\nAs with the other interpretations of quantum mechanics, the many-worlds interpretation is motivated by behavior that can be illustrated by the [[double-slit experiment]]. When [[photon|particles of light]] (or anything else) are passed through the double slit, a calculation assuming wave-like behavior of light can be used to identify where the particles are likely to be observed. Yet when the particles are observed in this experiment, they appear as particles (i.e., at definite places) and not as non-localized waves.\n\nSome versions of the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics proposed a process of \"[[wavefunction collapse|collapse]]\" in which an indeterminate quantum system would probabilistically collapse down onto, or select, just one determinate outcome to \"explain\" this phenomenon of observation. Wavefunction collapse was widely regarded as artificial and ''[[ad hoc]]''{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}, so an alternative interpretation in which the behavior of measurement could be understood from more fundamental physical principles was considered desirable.\n\nEverett's Ph.D. work provided such an alternative interpretation. Everett stated that for a composite system &ndash; for example a subject (the \"observer\" or measuring apparatus) observing an object (the \"observed\" system, such as a particle) &ndash; the statement that either the observer or the observed has a well-defined state is meaningless; in modern parlance, the observer and the observed have become [[quantum entanglement|entangled]]; we can only specify the state of one ''relative'' to the other, i.e., the state of the observer and the observed are correlated ''after'' the observation is made. This led Everett to derive from the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone (i.e., without assuming wavefunction collapse) the notion of a ''relativity of states''.\n\nEverett noticed that the unitary, deterministic dynamics alone decreed that after an observation is made each element of the [[quantum superposition]] of the combined subject\u2013object wavefunction contains two \"relative states\": a \"collapsed\" object state and an associated observer who has observed the same collapsed outcome; what the observer sees and the state of the object have become correlated by the act of measurement or observation. The subsequent evolution of each pair of relative subject\u2013object states proceeds with complete indifference as to the presence or absence of the other elements, ''as if'' wavefunction collapse has occurred, which has the consequence that later observations are always consistent with the earlier observations. Thus the ''appearance'' of the object's wavefunction's collapse has emerged from the unitary, deterministic theory itself. (This answered Einstein's early criticism of quantum theory, that the theory should define what is observed, not for the observables to define the theory).<ref name=\"einstein26\">\"Whether you can observe a thing or not depends on the theory which you use. It is the theory which decides what can be observed.\" [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Werner Heisenberg]], objecting to placing observables at the heart of the new quantum mechanics, during Heisenberg's 1926 lecture at Berlin; related by Heisenberg in 1968, quoted by [[Abdus Salam]], ''Unification of Fundamental Forces'', Cambridge University Press (1990) {{ISBN|0-521-37140-6}}, pp 98\u2013101</ref> Since the wavefunction merely appears to have collapsed then, Everett reasoned, there was no need to actually assume that it had collapsed. And so, invoking [[Occam's razor]], he removed the postulate of wavefunction collapse from the theory.\n\n==The unreal/real interpretation==\n\nAccording to [[Martin Gardner]], the \"other\" worlds of MWI have two different interpretations: real or unreal; he claims that [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Steven Weinberg]] both favour the unreal interpretation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071021033103/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2843/is_3_26/ai_85932634 A response to Bryce DeWitt], Martin Gardner, May 2002</ref> Gardner also claims that the nonreal interpretation is favoured by the majority of physicists, whereas the \"realist\" view is only supported by MWI experts such as Deutsch and [[Bryce DeWitt]].

In particular, the unreal MW interpretation of Hawking and Weinberg is similar to the Bohmian concept of unreal empty branch \u2018worlds\u2019:\n\n{{quote|The second issue with Bohmian mechanics may at first sight appear rather harmless, but which on a closer look develops considerable destructive power: the issue of empty branches. These are the components of the post-measurement state that do not guide any particles because they do not have the actual configuration ''q'' in their support. At first sight, the empty branches do not appear problematic but on the contrary very helpful as they enable the theory to explain unique outcomes of measurements. Also, they seem to explain why there is an effective \u201ccollapse of the wavefunction\u201d, as in ordinary quantum mechanics. On a closer view, though, one must admit that these empty branches do not actually disappear. As the wavefunction is taken to describe a really existing field, all their branches really exist and will evolve forever by the Schr\u00f6dinger dynamics, no matter how many of them will become empty in the course of the evolution. Every branch of the global wavefunction potentially describes a complete world which is, according to Bohm\u2019s ontology, only a possible world that would be the actual world if only it were filled with particles, and which is in every respect identical to a corresponding world in Everett\u2019s theory. Only one branch at a time is occupied by particles, thereby representing the actual world, while all other branches, though really existing as part of a really existing wavefunction, are empty and thus contain some sort of \u201czombie worlds\u201d with planets, oceans, trees, cities, cars and people who talk like us and behave like us, but who do not actually exist. Now, if the Everettian theory may be accused of ontological extravagance, then Bohmian mechanics could be accused of ontological wastefulness. On top of the ontology of empty branches comes the additional ontology of particle positions that are, on account of the quantum equilibrium hypothesis, forever unknown to the observer. Yet, the actual configuration is never needed for the calculation of the statistical predictions in experimental reality, for these can be obtained by mere wavefunction algebra. From this perspective, Bohmian mechanics may appear as a wasteful and redundant theory. I think it is considerations like these that are the biggest obstacle in the way of a general acceptance of Bohmian mechanics.<ref>{{Cite arxiv |eprint=1208.5632|author1=Kim Joris Bostr\u00f6m|title=Combining Bohm and Everett: Axiomatics for a Standalone Quantum Mechanics|class=quant-ph|year=2012}}</ref>}}\n\n===Probability===\nAttempts have been made, by many-world advocates and others, over the years to ''derive'' the [[Born rule]], rather than just conventionally ''assume'' it, so as to reproduce all the required statistical behaviour associated with quantum mechanics.

Systems such as '''S''' are referred to as 1-[[qubit]] systems.]] -->\nIn Everett's formulation, a measuring apparatus '''M''' and an object system '''S''' form a composite system, each of which prior to measurement exists in well-defined (but time-dependent) states. Measurement is regarded as causing '''M''' and '''S''' to interact. After '''S''' interacts with '''M''', it is no longer possible to describe either system by an independent state. According to Everett, the only meaningful descriptions of each system are relative states: for example the relative state of '''S''' given the state of '''M''' or the relative state of '''M''' given the state of '''S'''. In DeWitt's formulation, the state of '''S''' after a sequence of measurements is given by a quantum superposition of states, each one corresponding to an alternative measurement history of '''S'''.\n\n[[Image:Splittings-1.png|thumb|left|350px|Schematic illustration of splitting as a result of a repeated measurement.]]\nFor example, consider the smallest possible truly quantum system '''S''', as shown in the illustration. This describes for instance, the spin-state of an electron. Considering a specific axis (say the ''z''-axis) the north pole represents spin \"up\" and the south pole, spin \"down\". The superposition states of the system are described by (the surface of) a sphere called the [[Bloch sphere]]. To perform a measurement on '''S''', it is made to interact with another similar system '''M'''. After the interaction, the combined system is described by a state that ranges over a six-dimensional space (the reason for the number six is explained in the article on the Bloch sphere). This six-dimensional object can also be regarded as a quantum superposition of two \"alternative histories\" of the original system '''S''', one in which \"up\" was observed and the other in which \"down\" was observed. Each subsequent binary measurement (that is interaction with a system '''M''') causes a similar split in the history tree. Thus after three measurements, the system can be regarded as a quantum superposition of 8 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 copies of the original system '''S'''.\n\nThe accepted terminology is somewhat misleading because it is incorrect to regard the universe as splitting at certain times; at any given instant there is one state in one universe.\n\n===Relative state===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nIn his 1957 doctoral dissertation, Everett proposed that rather than modeling an isolated quantum system subject to external observation, one could mathematically model an object as well as its observers as purely physical systems within the mathematical framework developed by [[Paul Dirac]], [[von Neumann]] and others, discarding altogether the ''ad hoc'' mechanism of [[wave function collapse]].\n\nSince Everett's original work, there have appeared a number of similar formalisms in the literature. One such is the relative state formulation. It makes two assumptions: first, the wavefunction is not simply a description of the object's state, but that it actually is entirely equivalent to the object, a claim it has in common with some other interpretations. Secondly, observation or measurement has no special laws or mechanics, unlike in the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] which considers the wavefunction collapse as a special kind of event which occurs as a result of observation. Instead, measurement in the relative state formulation is the consequence of a configuration change in the memory of an observer described by the same basic wave physics as the object being modeled.\n\nThe many-worlds interpretation is DeWitt's popularisation of Everett's work, who had referred to the combined observer\u2013object system as being split by an observation, each split corresponding to the different or multiple possible outcomes of an observation. These splits generate a possible tree as shown in the graphic below. Subsequently, DeWitt introduced the term \"world\" to describe a complete measurement history of an observer, which corresponds roughly to a single branch of that tree. Note that \"splitting\" in this sense is hardly new or even quantum mechanical. The idea of a space of complete alternative histories had already been used in the theory of probability since the mid-1930s for instance to model [[Brownian motion]]. [[Image:Many-worlds.svg|thumb|300px|Partial trace as relative state. Light blue rectangle on upper left denotes system in pure state. Trellis shaded rectangle in upper right denotes a (possibly) mixed state. Mixed state from observation is partial trace of a linear superposition of states as shown in lower right-hand corner.]][[Image:Paths-many-worlds.svg|thumb|right|300px|Successive measurements with successive splittings]]\n\nUnder the many-worlds interpretation, the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]], or relativistic analog, holds all the time everywhere. An observation or measurement is modeled by applying the wave equation to the entire system comprising the observer ''and'' the object. One consequence is that every observation can be thought of as causing the combined observer\u2013object's wavefunction to change into a quantum superposition of two or more non-interacting branches, or split into many \"worlds\". Since many observation-like events have happened and are constantly happening, there are an enormous and growing number of simultaneously existing states.\n\nIf a system is composed of two or more subsystems, the system's state will be a superposition of products of the subsystems' states. Each product of subsystem states in the overall superposition evolves over time independently of other products. Once the subsystems interact, their states have become correlated or [[quantum entanglement|entangled]] and it is no longer possible to consider them independent of one another. In Everett's terminology each subsystem state was now ''correlated'' with its ''relative state'', since each subsystem must now be considered relative to the other subsystems with which it has interacted.\n\n===Properties of the theory===\n\nMWI removes the observer-dependent role in the [[quantum measurement]] process by replacing [[wavefunction collapse]] with [[quantum decoherence]]. Since the role of the observer lies at the heart of most if not all \"quantum paradoxes,\" this automatically resolves a number of problems; see for example [[Schr\u00f6dinger's cat]] [[thought experiment]], the [[EPR paradox]], [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]]'s \"boundary problem\" and even [[wave-particle duality]]. [[Quantum cosmology]] also becomes intelligible, since there is no need anymore for an observer outside of the universe.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nMWI is a [[philosophical realism|realist]], [[deterministic]], arguably [[local realism|local]] theory, akin to [[classical physics]] (including the [[theory of relativity]]), at the expense of losing [[counterfactual definiteness]]. MWI achieves this by removing [[wavefunction collapse]], which is indeterministic and non-local, from the [[deterministic]] and [[local realism|local]] equations of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]].<ref name=rubinlocality>[[Mark A.

In most no-collapse interpretations, the evolution of the quantum state of the Universe is the same. Still, one might imagine that there is an experiment distinguishing the MWI from another no-collapse interpretation based on the difference in the correspondence between the formalism and the experience (the results of experiments).\"<ref name=\"stanford\">{{cite web |last=Vaidman |first=Lev |title=Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/ |publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in 1985, David Deutsch published three related thought experiments which could test the theory vs the Copenhagen interpretation.<ref>Deutsch, D., (1986) 'Three experimental implications of the Everett interpretation', in R.

However, present day understanding of decoherence does not allow a completely precise, self-contained way to say when the two branches have decohered/\"do not interact\", and hence many-worlds interpretation remains arbitrary. This objection is saying that it is not clear what is precisely meant by branching, and point to the lack of self-contained criteria specifying branching.\n::MWI response: the decoherence or \"splitting\" or \"branching\" is complete when the [[quantum measurement|measurement]] is complete. In [[Bra\u2013ket notation|Dirac notation]] a measurement is complete when:\n:::<math>\\lang O_i|O_j\\rang = \\delta_{ij}</math><ref name=dewitt71ortho>[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], Quantum Mechanics and Reality: Could the solution to the dilemma of indeterminism be a universe in which all possible outcomes of an experiment actually occur?, ''Physics Today'', 23(9) pp 30\u201340 (September 1970); see equation 10</ref>\n::where <math>O_i</math> represents the observer having detected the object system in the ''i''th state. Before the measurement has started the observer states are identical; after the measurement is complete the observer states are [[Orthonormality|orthonormal]].<ref name=everett57/><ref name=dewitt73/> Thus a measurement defines the branching process: the branching is as well- or ill-defined as the measurement is; the branching is as complete as the measurement is complete \u2013 which is to say that the delta function above represents an idealised measurement. Although true \"for all practical purposes\" in reality the measurement, and hence the branching, is never fully complete, since delta functions are unphysical,<ref>Penrose, R. ''The Road to Reality'', \u00a721.11</ref>\n::Since the role of the observer and measurement per se plays no special role in MWI (measurements are handled as all other interactions are) there is no need for a precise definition of what an observer or a measurement is \u2014 just as in [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] no precise definition of either an observer or a measurement was required or expected. In all circumstances the [[universal wavefunction]] is still available to give a complete description of reality.\n::Also, it is a common misconception to think that branches are completely separate.

There is nothing special about measurements (such as the ability to trigger a [[wave function collapse]]), that cannot be dealt with by the usual [[Unitarity (physics)|unitary]] time development process.<ref name=everett56/> This is why there is no precise definition of measurement in Everett's formulation, although some other formulations emphasize that measurements must be effectively irreversible or create classical information.\n\nThe splitting of worlds forward in time, but not backwards in time (i.e., merging worlds), is time asymmetric and incompatible with the time symmetric nature of [[Schr\u00f6dinger's equation]], or [[CPT invariance]] in general.<ref>Joseph Gerver, The past as backward movies of the future, ''Physics Today'', letters followup, 24(4), (April 1971), pp 46\u20137</ref>\n::MWI response: The splitting is time asymmetric; this observed temporal asymmetry is due to the [[boundary conditions]] imposed by the [[Big Bang]]<ref>[[Bryce Seligman DeWitt]], ''Physics Today'', letters followup, 24(4), (April 1971), pp 43</ref>\n\nThere is circularity in Everett's measurement theory. Under the assumptions made by Everett, there are no 'good observations' as defined by him, and since his analysis of the observational process depends on the latter, it is void of any meaning.

For example, a section in his 1993 textbook had the title ''Everett's interpretation and other bizarre theories''.

An interpretation can be regarded as a purely formal transformation, which adds nothing to the rules of the [[quantum mechanics]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Peres seems to suggest{{according to whom|date=January 2016}} that positing the existence of an infinite number of non-communicating [[Multiverse|parallel universes]] is highly suspect per those{{who|date=January 2016}} who interpret it as a violation of [[Occam's razor]], i.e., that it does not minimize the number of hypothesized entities.

A possible test of this using quantum-optical equipment is described in a 1997 ''[[Foundations of Physics]]'' article by [[Rainer Plaga]].<ref name=\"plaga\"/> It involves an isolated [[ion]] in an [[ion trap]], a quantum measurement that would yield two parallel worlds (their difference just being in the detection of a single photon), and the [[Excited state|excitation]] of the ion from only one of these worlds. If the excited ion can be detected from the other parallel universe, then this would constitute direct evidence in support of the many-worlds interpretation and would automatically exclude the orthodox, \"logical\", and \"many-histories\" interpretations. The reason the ion is isolated is to make it not participate immediately in the decoherence which insulates the parallel world branches, therefore allowing it to act as a gateway between the two worlds, and if the measure apparatus could perform the measurements quickly enough before the gateway ion is decoupled then the test would succeed (with electronic computers the necessary time window between the two worlds would be in a time scale of [[millisecond]]s or [[nanosecond]]s, and if the measurements are taken by humans then a few seconds would still be enough). R. Plaga shows that macroscopic decoherence timescales are a possibility. The proposed test is based on technical equipment described in a 1993 ''[[Physical Review]]'' article by Itano et al.<ref name=\"itano\">W.M.Itano et al., Phys. Rev. A47,3354 (1993).</ref> and R. Plaga says that this level of technology is enough to realize the proposed inter-world communication experiment. The necessary technology for precision measurements of single ions already exists since the 1970s, and the ion recommended for excitation is <sup>199</sup>Hg<sup>+</sup>. The excitation methodology is described by Itano et al. and the time needed for it is given by the [[Rabi flopping]] formula.<ref>M. SargentIII, M. O. Scully and W. E. Lamb, Laser physics (Addison-Wesley, Reading, 1974), p. 27.</ref>\n\nSuch a test as described by R. Plaga would mean that energy transfer is possible between parallel worlds. This does not violate the fundamental principles of physics because these require energy conservation only for the whole universe and not for the single parallel branches.<ref name=\"plaga\" /> Neither the excitation of the single ion (which is a [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] of the proposed system) leads to decoherence, something which is proven by [[Welcher Weg]] detectors which can excite atoms without momentum transfer (which causes the loss of coherence).<ref>M.O. Scully and H. Walther, Phys. Rev. A 39,5229 (1989).</ref>\n\nThe proposed test would allow for low-bandwidth inter-world communication, the limiting factors of bandwidth and time being dependent on the technology of the equipment. Because of the time needed to determine the state of the partially decohered isolated excited ion based on Itano et al.'s methodology, the ion would decohere by the time its state is determined during the experiment, so Plaga's proposal would pass just enough information between the two worlds to confirm their parallel existence and nothing more. The author contemplates that with increased bandwidth, one could even transfer television imagery across the parallel worlds.<ref name=\"plaga\" /> For example, Itano et al.'s methodology could be improved (by lowering the time needed for state determination of the excited ion) if a more efficient process were found for the detection of fluorescence radiation using 194&nbsp;nm photons.<ref name=\"plaga\" />\n\nA 1991 article by J. Polchinski also supports the view that inter-world communication is a theoretical possibility.<ref>J. Polchinski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 66,397 (1991).</ref> Other authors in a 1994 preprint article also contemplated similar ideas.<ref>M. Gell-Mann and J. B. Hartle, Equivalent Sets of Histories and Multiple Quasiclassical Domains, preprint University of California at Santa Barbara UCSBTH-94-09 (1994).</ref>\n\nThe reason inter-world communication seems like a possibility is because [[decoherence]] which separates the parallel worlds is never fully complete,<ref name=\"zeh16\">H. D. Zeh, Found.Phys. 3,109 (1973).</ref><ref>H. D. Zeh, Phys. Lett. A 172,189 (1993).</ref> therefore weak influences from one parallel world to another can still pass between them,<ref name=\"zeh16\" /><ref>A. Albrecht, Phys. Rev. D 48, 3768 (1993).</ref> and these should be measurable with advanced technology. Deutsch proposed such an experiment in a 1985 ''[[International Journal of Theoretical Physics]]'' article,<ref>D.

In a 2015 interview he stated \"We simply don't know...it might be that the modulus over the wavefunction of that possibility [i.e. an extremely absurd yet physically possible event] is zero in which case there is no such world...There are universes out there, which you could imagine which...would not be actualized.\" <ref>Audio interview with Frank Tipler- White Gardenia interview with Frank Tipler, December 2015\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMkp1kZN5n4&t=26s</ref>\n\n===Similarity to modal realism===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nThe many-worlds interpretation has some similarity to [[modal realism]] in [[philosophy]], which is the view that the [[possible world]]s used to interpret modal claims exist and are of a kind with the actual world. Unlike the possible worlds of philosophy, however, in quantum mechanics counterfactual alternatives can influence the results of experiments, as in the [[Elitzur\u2013Vaidman bomb-testing problem]] or the [[Quantum Zeno effect]]. Also, while the worlds of the many-worlds interpretation all share the same physical laws, modal realism postulates a world for every way things could conceivably have been.\n\n===Time travel===\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2016}}\nThe many-worlds interpretation could be one possible way to resolve the paradoxes<ref name=\"deutsch98\"/> that one would expect to arise ''if'' [[time travel]] turns out to be permitted by physics (permitting [[closed timelike curves]] and thus violating [[causality]]). Entering the past would itself be a quantum event causing branching, and therefore the timeline accessed by the time traveller simply would be another timeline of many. In that sense, it would make the [[Novikov self-consistency principle]] unnecessary.\n\n==Many-worlds in literature and science fiction==\n{{Main|Parallel universe (fiction)}}\n{{See also|Alternate History}}\n\n''[[Star Trek]]'' uses many-worlds in many stories. In the ''[[Star Trek: Original Series|Original Series]]'', Spock and Kirk make a crossover into a mirror universe and encounter versions of themselves from the other universe. In an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', Worf crosses over into a parallel universe while piloting a shuttlecraft and manages to encounter several other universes. The TNG finale \"All Good Things\" uses the concept heavily as Picard jumps between times. This is continued in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space 9]]'' with the episodes arching between the Terran empire and the Alliance, where Sisko and Kira also find mirror versions of themselves and other characters who are currently dead in the central universe, or dead in the parallel universe.\n\n[[Michael Crichton]]'s 1999 novel, ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'', is about time travel into the past. The technology used in the book is based upon the existence of the MWI's multiverse as described by Everett.<ref>The book erroneously attributes the phrase \"many worlds\" to Everett. \n It was actually coined by [[Bryce DeWitt]].</ref><ref name=\"Crichton2013\">{{cite book|author=Michael Crichton|title=Timeline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQL2n6NrQ_MC|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-345-53901-4|pages=121\u2013123, 127-128}}</ref>\n\nThe author [[Neal Stephenson]] drew on the many-worlds theory for some aspects of his 2008 novel ''[[Anathem]]''.\n\nA more recent iteration, ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' on the channel [[Adult Swim]], uses the many-worlds interpretation as a basis for the occurrences in the show. The cartoon also makes an allusion to [[Schr\u00f6dinger's Cat]] in an episode in which they split their existence into two hypothetical, equally possible existences.\n\nIn [[Stranger Things#Season 1 (2016)|episode 5]] of the [[Netflix]] series, ''[[Stranger Things]]'', the protagonists' middle school teacher Scott Clarke specifically mentions the many-worlds theory when asked about the possibility of \"theoretical\" alternate dimensions.\n\nMany worlds interpretation was also used in The time Ships by Stephen Baxter.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==See also==\n{{cmn|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Consistent histories]]\n* [[EPR paradox]]\n* ''[[Fabric of Reality]]''\n* [[Garden of Forking Paths]]\n* [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics]]\n* [[Many-minds interpretation]]\n* [[Multiverse]]\n* [[Multiple histories]]\n* ''[[The Beginning of Infinity]]''\n* [[Quantum immortality]] \u2013 a thought experiment.\n* [[Wave function collapse]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Jeffrey A.

The GCC countries have a rapidly growing market and characterized by a population that becomes wealthier (Yuldashev). As such, retailers have launched Arabic-language websites as a means to target this population. Secondly, there are predictions of increased mobile purchases and an expanding internet audience (Yuldashev). The growth and development of the two aspects make the GCC countries to become larger players in the electronic commerce market with time progress. Specifically, research shows that e-commerce market is expected to grow to over $20 billion by the year 2020 among these GCC countries (Yuldashev). \nThe e-commerce market has also gained much popularity among the western countries, and in particular Europe and the U.S. These countries have been highly characterized with consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) (Geisler, 34). However, trends show that there are future signs of a reverse. Similar to the GCC countries, there has been increased purchase of goods and services in online channels rather than offline channels. Activist investors are trying hard to consolidate and slash their overall cost and the governments in western countries continue to impose more regulation on CPG manufacturers (Geisler, 36). In these senses, CPG investors are being forced to adapt e-commerce as it is effective as a well as a means for them to thrive.\n\nIn 2013, Brazil's e-commerce was growing quickly with retail e-commerce sales expected to grow at a double-digit pace through 2014. By 2016, eMarketer expected retail e-commerce sales in Brazil to reach $17.3 billion.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper = eMarketer | url = http://www.emarketer.com/Article/More-Buyers-Join-Brazils-Robust-Ecommerce-Market/1009725 |title = More Buyers Join Brazil's Robust Ecommerce Market}}</ref> India has an Internet user base of about 460 million as of December 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/topics/2157/internet-usage-in-india/|title=Internet usage in India \u2013 Statistics & Facts|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista|access-date=29 December 2017}}</ref> Despite being third largest user base in world, the penetration of Internet is low compared to markets like the United States, United Kingdom or France but is growing at a much faster rate, adding around 6 million new entrants every month.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} In India, cash on delivery is the most preferred payment method, accumulating 75% of the e-retail activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phani_Pasumarthy/publication/311518414_AFFECT_OF_DEMONETIZATION_ON_E-COMMERCE/links/584a7f5708ae4a7a6917c3d0/AFFECT-OF-DEMONETIZATION-ON-E-COMMERCE|title=Affect of demonetization on e-commerce \u2013 ResearchGate|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}} The India retail market is expected to rise from 2.5% in 2016 to 5% in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/in/pdf/2016/08/E-commerce-retail-logistics-India.pdf|title=India\u2019s e-commerce retail logistics growth story|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe future trends in the GCC countries will be similar with that of the western countries. Despite the forces that push business to adapt e-commerce as a means to sell goods and products, the manner in which customers make purchases is similar in countries from these two regions. For instance, there has been an increased usage of smartphones which comes in conjunction with an increase in the overall internet audience from the regions. Yuldashev writes that consumers are scaling up to more modern technology that allows for mobile marketing.\nHowever, the percentage of smartphone and internet users who make online purchases is expected to vary in the first few years. It will be independent on the willingness of the people to adopt this new trend (The Statistics Portal). For example, UAE has the greatest smartphone penetration of 73.8 percent and has 91.9 percent of its population has access to the internet. On the other hand, smartphone penetration in Europe has been reported to be at 64.7 percent (The Statistics Portal). Regardless, the disparity in percentage between these regions is expected to level out in future because e-commerce technology is expected to grow allowing for more users. \nThe e-commerce business within these two regions will result in a competition. Government bodies at country level will enhance their measures and strategies to ensure sustainability and consumer protection (Krings, et al.). These increased measures will raise the environmental and social standards in the countries, factors that will determine the success of e-commerce market in these countries. For example, an adoption of tough sanctions will make it difficult for companies to enter the e-commerce market while lenient sanctions will allow ease of companies. As such, the future trends between GCC countries and the Western countries will be independent of these sanctions (Krings, et al.). These countries need to make rational conclusions in coming up with effective sanctions.\n\nThe rate of growth of the number of internet users in the Arab countries has been rapid \u2013 13.1% in 2015. A significant portion of the e-commerce market in the Middle East comprises people in the 30\u201334 year age group.

The online market is expected to grow by 56% in 2015\u20132020. Traditional markets are only expected 2% growth during the same time. [[Brick and mortar]] retailers are struggling because of online retailer's ability to offer lower prices and higher efficiency. Many larger retailers are able to maintain a presence offline and online by linking physical and online offerings.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nE-commerce allows customers to overcome geographical barriers and allows them to purchase products anytime and from anywhere. Online and traditional markets have different strategies for conducting business. Traditional retailers offer fewer assortment of products because of shelf space where, online retailers often hold no inventory but send customer orders directly to the manufacture. The pricing strategies are also different for traditional and online retailers. Traditional retailers base their prices on store traffic and the cost to keep inventory. Online retailers base prices on the speed of delivery.\n\nThere are two ways for marketers to conduct business through e-commerce: fully online or online along with a brick and mortar store. Online marketers can offer lower prices, greater product selection, and high efficiency rates. Many customers prefer online markets if the products can be delivered quickly at relatively low price. However, online retailers cannot offer the physical experience that traditional retailers can. It can be difficult to judge the quality of a product without the physical experience, which may cause customers to experience product or seller uncertainty. Another issue regarding the online market is concerns about the security of online transactions. Many customers remain loyal to well-known retailers because of this issue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Li|first=Zhaolin|date=July 2015|title=Online Versus Bricks-And-Mortar Retailing: A Comparison of Price, Assortment and Delivery Time|doi=10.1080/00207543.2014.973074|journal=International Journal of Production Research|volume=53|issue=13|pages=3823\u20133835}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dimkota|first=Angelika|date=June 2012|title=On Product Uncertainty in Online Markets: Theory and Evidence|url=https://yilihong.github.io/paper/Product%20Uncertainty%20in%20Online%20Markets_Dimoka_Hong_Pavlou2012.pdf|journal=MIS Quarterly|volume=36|pages=395\u2013A15}}</ref>\n\nSecurity is a primary problem for e-commerce in developed and developing countries.

The affections on physical flows improved the way of product and inventory movement level for companies. For the information flows, e-commerce optimised the capacity of information processing than companies used to have, and for the financial flows, e-commerce allows companies to have more efficient payment and settlement solutions.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\"/>\n\nIn addition, e-commerce has a more sophisticated level of impact on supply chains: Firstly, the performance gap will be eliminated since companies can identify gaps between different levels of supply chains by electronic means of solutions; Secondly, as a result of e-commerce emergence, new capabilities such implementing ERP systems, like [[SAP ERP]], [[Xero (software)|Xero]], or [[Megaventory]], have helped companies to manage operations with customers and suppliers. Yet these new capabilities are still not fully exploited. Thirdly, technology companies would keep investing on new e-commerce software solutions as they are expecting investment return. Fourthly, e-commerce would help to solve many aspects of issues that companies may feel difficult to cope with, such as political barriers or cross-country changes. Finally, e-commerce provides companies a more efficient and effective way to collaborate with each other within the supply chain.<ref name=\"ideas.repec.org\"/>\n\n== Impact on employment ==\nE-commerce helps create new job opportunities due to information related services, software app and digital products. It also causes job losses. The areas with the greatest predicted job-loss are retail, postal, and travel agencies. The development of e-commerce will create jobs that require highly skilled workers to manage large amounts of information, customer demands, and production processes. In contrast, people with poor technical skills cannot enjoy the wages welfare. On the other hand, because e-commerce requires sufficient stocks that could be delivered to customers in time, the warehouse becomes an important element. Warehouse needs more staff to manage, supervise and organize, thus the condition of warehouse environment will be concerned by employees.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|title=The impact of e-commerce on international trade and employment |last=Teriz|first=N|date=2011|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.09.010|volume=24|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|pages=745\u2013753}}</ref>\n\n== Impact on customers ==\nE-commerce brings convenience for customers as they do not have to leave home and only need to browse website online, especially for buying the products which are not sold in nearby shops. It could help customers buy wider range of products and save customers\u2019 time. Consumers also gain power through online shopping. They are able to research products and compare prices among retailers. Also, online shopping often provides sales promotion or discounts code, thus it is more price effective for customers. Moreover, e-commerce provides products\u2019 detailed information; even the in-store staff cannot offer such detailed explanation. Customers can also review and track the order history online.\n\nE-commerce technologies cut transaction costs by allowing both manufactures and consumers to skip through the intermediaries. This is achieved through by extending the search area best price deals and by group purchase. The success of e-commerce in urban and regional levels depend on how the local firms and consumers have adopted to e-commerce. \n<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www-jstor-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/stable/43084757?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=The&searchText=impact&searchText=of&searchText=e-commerce&searchText=on&searchText=international&searchText=trade&searchText=and&searchText=employment&searchUri=/action/doBasicSearch?wc=on&amp;Query=The+impact+of+e-commerce+on+international+trade+and+employment+&amp;group=none&amp;acc=on&amp;fc=off&refreqid=search:9152a690fbce039bb1a8a26334497de4&seq=7#page_scan_tab_contents|title=Shibboleth Authentication Request|website=www-jstor-org.offcampus.lib.washington.edu}}</ref>\n\nHowever, e-commerce lacks human interaction for customers, especially who prefer face-to-face connection.

E-commerce requires the company to have the ability to satisfy multiple needs of different customers and provide them with wider range of products.\n\nWith more choices of products, the information of products for customers to select and meet their needs become crucial. In order to address the mass customization principle to the company, the use of recommender system is suggested. This system helps recommend the proper products to the customers and helps customers make the decision during the purchasing process. The recommender system could be operated through the top sellers on the website, the demographics of customers or the consumers' buying behavior. However, there are 3 main ways of recommendations: recommending products to customers directly, providing detailed products' information and showing other buyers' opinions or critiques. It is benefit for consumer experience without physical shopping. In general, recommender system is used to contact customers online and assist finding the right products they want effectively and directly.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Applications of Data Mining to Electronic Commerce|last=Schafer|first=J.

Bernoulli, however, did not evaluate the integral.\n\nBernoulli's correspondence with Euler (who also knew the above equation) shows that Bernoulli did not fully understand [[complex logarithm]]s. Euler also suggested that the complex logarithms can have infinitely many values.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Roger Cotes]] in 1714 discovered that<ref name=\"Stillwell\">{{cite book|author=John Stillwell|title=Mathematics and Its History|publisher=Springer|year=2002 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V7mxZqjs5yUC&pg=PA315}}</ref>\n\n:<math>ix = \\ln(\\cos x + i\\sin x).</math>\n\nCotes missed the fact{{cn|reason=The lengthy quote in our bio article makes it clear that Cotes was talking about an arc of a quadrant of a circle, so multiples of pi would not have arisen (except, conceivably, as some sort of mistake in his proof); it also says he didn't use the term natural log, perhaps because it hadn't been invented yet, and used the Latin term for 'measure' instead; at any rate the claim that he 'missed' something, with its connotation of incompetence, seems thoroughly dubious (though not necessarily wrong if his proof was flawed as a result) and in need of a supporting citation from a reliable source, or alternatively some kind of less pejorative and less anachronistic re-wording.|date=January 2018}} that a complex logarithm can have infinitely many values, differing by multiples of {{math|2''i''\u03c0}}, due to the periodicity of the trigonometric functions.\n\nAround 1740 Euler turned his attention to the exponential function instead of logarithms and obtained the formula used today that is named after him. It was published in 1748, obtained by comparing the series expansions of the exponential and trigonometric expressions.<ref>[[Leonard Euler]] (1748) [http://www.17centurymaths.com/contents/euler/introductiontoanalysisvolone/ch8vol1.pdf Chapter 8: On transcending quantities arising from the circle] of [[Introduction to the Analysis of the Infinite]], page 214, section 138 (translation by Ian Bruce, pdf link from 17 century maths).</ref><ref name=\"Stillwell\"/>\n\nThe view of complex numbers as points in the [[complex plane]] was described about 50 years later by [[Caspar Wessel]].\n\n==Applications in complex number theory==\n[[Image:Euler's formula.svg|thumb|right]]\n[[Image:Euler's Formula c.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Three-dimensional visualization of Euler's formula. See also [[circular polarization]].]]\n;Interpretation of the formula\n\nThis formula can be interpreted as saying that the function {{mvar|e<sup>i\u03c6</sup>}} is a [[unit complex number]], i.e., it traces out the [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane]] as {{mvar|\u03c6}} ranges through the real numbers. Here {{mvar|\u03c6}} is the [[angle]] that a line connecting the origin with a point on the unit circle makes with the [[positive real axis]], measured counterclockwise and in [[radian]]s.\n\nThe original proof is based on the [[Taylor series]] expansions of the [[exponential function]] {{mvar|e<sup>z</sup>}} (where {{mvar|z}} is a complex number) and of {{math|sin ''x''}} and {{math|cos ''x''}} for real numbers {{mvar|x}} (see below). In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all ''complex'' numbers&nbsp;{{mvar|x}}.\n\nA point in the [[complex plane]] can be represented by a complex number written in [[Coordinates (elementary mathematics)#Cartesian coordinates|cartesian coordinates]]. Euler's formula provides a means of conversion between cartesian coordinates and [[Polar coordinate system|polar coordinates]]. The polar form simplifies the mathematics when used in multiplication or powers of complex numbers. Any complex number {{math|1 = ''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}}, and its complex conjugate, {{math|1 = {{overline|''z''}} = ''x'' \u2212 ''iy''}}, can be written as\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz &= x + iy = |z| (\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi) = r e^{i \\varphi}, \\\\\n\\bar{z} &= x - iy = |z| (\\cos \\varphi - i\\sin \\varphi) = r e^{-i \\varphi},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere\n:{{math|1=''x'' = Re ''z''}} is the real part,\n:{{math|1=''y'' = Im ''z''}} is the imaginary part,\n:{{math|1=''r'' = {{abs|''z''}} = {{sqrt|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup>}}}} is the [[magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of {{mvar|z}}\n:{{math|1=''\u03c6'' = arg ''z'' = [[atan2]](''y'', ''x'')}}.\n\n{{mvar|\u03c6}} is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] of {{mvar|z}}, i.e., the angle between the ''x'' axis and the vector ''z'' measured counterclockwise in [[radian]]s, which is defined [[up to]] addition of {{math|2\u03c0}}. Many texts write {{math|1=''\u03c6'' = tan<sup>\u22121</sup> ''{{sfrac|y|x}}''}} instead of {{math|1= ''\u03c6'' = atan2(''y'',''x'')}}, but the first equation needs adjustment when {{mvar|''x'' \u2264 0}}. This is because for any real {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} not both zero the angles of the vectors {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}} and {{math|(\u2212''x'', \u2212''y'')}} differ by {{math|\u03c0}} radians, but have the identical value of {{math|1=tan ''\u03c6'' = ''{{sfrac|y|x}}''}}.\n\n;Use of the formula to define the logarithm of complex numbers\n\nNow, taking this derived formula, we can use Euler's formula to define the [[logarithm]] of a complex number. To do this, we also use the definition of the logarithm (as the inverse operator of exponentiation):\n\n:<math>a = e^{\\ln a}, </math>\n\nand that\n\n:<math>e^a e^b = e^{a + b}, </math>\n\nboth valid for any complex numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}.\n\nTherefore, one can write:\n\n:<math>z = |z| e^{i \\varphi} = e^{\\ln|z|} e^{i \\varphi} = e^{\\ln|z| + i \\varphi}</math>\n\nfor any {{math|''z'' \u2260 0}}. Taking the logarithm of both sides shows that\n\n:<math>\\ln z = \\ln|z| + i \\varphi,</math>\n\nand in fact this can be used as the definition for the [[complex logarithm]]. The logarithm of a complex number is thus a [[multi-valued function]], because {{mvar|\u03c6}} is multi-valued.\n\nFinally, the other exponential law\n\n: <math>\\left(e^a\\right)^k = e^{a k},</math>\n\nwhich can be seen to hold for all integers {{mvar|k}}, together with Euler's formula, implies several [[trigonometric identity|trigonometric identities]], as well as [[de Moivre's formula]].\n\n==Relationship to trigonometry==\n[[File:Sine Cosine Exponential qtl1.svg|thumb|Relationship between sine, cosine and exponential function]]\nEuler's formula provides a powerful connection between [[mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[trigonometry]], and provides an interpretation of the sine and cosine functions as [[weighted sum]]s of the exponential function:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\cos x &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left(e^{ix}\\right) =\\frac{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}{2}, \\\\\n\\sin x &= \\operatorname{Im} \\left(e^{ix}\\right) =\\frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe two equations above can be derived by adding or subtracting Euler's formulas:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\ne^{ix}  &= \\cos x + i \\sin x, \\\\\ne^{-ix} &= \\cos(- x) + i \\sin(- x) = \\cos x - i \\sin x\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand solving for either cosine or sine.\n\nThese formulas can even serve as the definition of the trigonometric functions for complex arguments {{mvar|x}}. For example, letting {{math|1=''x'' = ''iy''}}, we have:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\cos(iy) &= \\frac{e^{-y} + e^y}{2} = \\cosh(y), \\\\\n\\sin(iy) &= \\frac{e^{-y} - e^y}{2i} = i \\left(\\frac{e^y - e^{-y}}{2}\\right) = i\\sinh(y).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nComplex exponentials can simplify trigonometry, because they are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal components. One technique is simply to convert sinusoids into equivalent expressions in terms of exponentials. After the manipulations, the simplified result is still real-valued. For example:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\cos x\\cdot \\cos y &= \\frac{e^{ix}+e^{-ix}}{2} \\cdot \\frac{e^{iy}+e^{-iy}}{2} \\\\\n &= \\frac12\\cdot \\frac{e^{i(x+y)}+e^{i(x-y)}+e^{i(-x+y)}+e^{i(-x-y)}}{2} \\\\\n &= \\frac12 \\bigg( \\underbrace{ \\frac{e^{i(x+y)} + e^{-i(x+y)}}{2} }_{\\cos(x+y)} + \\underbrace{ \\frac{e^{i(x-y)} + e^{-i(x-y)}}{2} }_{\\cos(x-y)} \\bigg).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nAnother technique is to represent the sinusoids in terms of the [[real part]] of a complex expression and perform the manipulations on the complex expression. For example:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\cos(nx) &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left(e^{inx}\\right) \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left( e^{i(n-1)x}\\cdot e^{ix} \\right) \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{Re} \\Big( e^{i(n-1)x}\\cdot \\big(\\underbrace{e^{ix} + e^{-ix}}_{2\\cos x } - e^{-ix}\\big) \\Big) \\\\\n &= \\operatorname{Re} \\left( e^{i(n-1)x}\\cdot 2\\cos x - e^{i(n-2)x} \\right) \\\\\n &= \\cos[(n-1)x] \\cdot [2 \\cos(x)] - \\cos[(n-2)x].\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis formula is used for recursive generation of {{math|cos ''nx''}} for integer values of {{mvar|n}} and arbitrary {{mvar|x}} (in radians).\n\nSee also [[Phasor#Phasor arithmetic|Phasor arithmetic]].\n\n==Topological interpretation==\nIn the language of [[topology]], Euler's formula states that the imaginary exponential function {{math|''t'' \u21a6 ''e<sup>it</sup>''}} is a (surjective) [[morphism]] of [[topological group]]s from the real line {{math|\u211d}} to the unit circle {{math|<math>\\mathbb S</math><sup>1</sup>}}. In fact, this exhibits {{math|\u211d}} as a [[covering space]] of <math>\\mathbb S^1</math>. Similarly, [[Euler's identity]] says that the [[Kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of this map is {{math|\u03c4\u2124}}, where {{math|1=\u03c4 = 2\u03c0}}. These observations may be combined and summarized in the [[commutative diagram]] below:\n\n[[File:Euler's formula commutative diagram.png|frameless|center|Euler's formula and identity combined in diagrammatic form]]\n\n==Other applications==\n{{see also|Complex number#Applications}}\n\nIn [[differential equations]], the function {{math|''e<sup>ix</sup>''}} is often used to simplify solutions, even if the final answer is a real function involving sine and cosine. The reason for this is that the exponential function is the [[eigenfunction]] of the operation of [[differentiation (mathematics)|differentiation]].\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], [[signal processing]], and similar fields, signals that vary periodically over time are often described as a combination of sinusoidal functions (see [[Fourier analysis]]), and these are more conveniently expressed as the sum of exponential functions with [[imaginary number|imaginary]] exponents, using Euler's formula. Also, [[phasor analysis]] of circuits can include Euler's formula to represent the impedance of a capacitor or an inductor.\n\nIn the [[four-dimensional space]] of [[quaternion]]s, there is a [[sphere]] of [[imaginary unit]]s. For any point ''r'' on this sphere, and ''x'' a real number, Euler's formula applies:\n:<math>\\exp(xr) = \\cos x + r \\sin x,</math>\nand the element is called a [[versor]] in quaternions. The set of all versors forms a [[3-sphere]] in the 4-space.\n\n==Definitions of complex exponentiation==\n{{main|Exponentiation|Exponential function}}\n\nThe exponential function {{math|''e<sup>x</sup>''}} for real values of {{math|''x''}} may be defined in a few different equivalent ways (see [[Characterizations of the exponential function]]). Several of these methods may be directly extended to give definitions of {{math|''e<sup>z</sup>''}} for complex values of {{math|''z''}} simply by substituting {{math|''z''}} in place of {{math|''x''}} and using the complex algebraic operations. In particular we may use either of the two following definitions, which are equivalent. From a more advanced perspective, each of these definitions may be interpreted as giving the unique [[analytic continuation]] of {{math|''e<sup>x</sup>''}} to the complex plane.\n\n===Power series definition===\nFor complex {{math|''z''}}\n\n:<math>e^z = 1 + \\frac{z}{1!} + \\frac{z^2}{2!} + \\frac{z^3}{3!} + \\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}.</math>\n\nUsing the [[ratio test]], it is possible to show that this [[power series]] has an infinite [[radius of convergence]] and so defines {{math|''e<sup>z</sup>''}} for all complex {{math|''z''}}.\n\n===Limit definition===\nFor complex {{math|''z''}}\n\n:<math>e^z = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\left(1+\\frac{z}{n}\\right)^n.</math>\n\n==Proofs==\nVarious proofs of the formula are possible.\n\n===Using power series===\nHere is a proof of Euler's formula using [[Taylor series|power-series expansions]], as well as basic facts about the powers of {{mvar|i}}:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjK0F0T3NBoC&pg=PA428 |title=A Modern Introduction to Differential Equations |first=Henry J. |last=Ricardo |page=428}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\ni^0 &= 1, & i^1 &= i, & i^2 &= -1, & i^3 &= -i, \\\\\ni^4 &= 1, & i^5 &= i, & i^6 &= -1, & i^7 &= -i \\\\\n&\\vdots   & &\\vdots   & &\\vdots    & &\\vdots\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nUsing now the power-series definition from above, we see that for real values of {{mvar|x}}\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n e^{ix} &= 1 + ix + \\frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \\frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \\frac{(ix)^5}{5!} + \\frac{(ix)^6}{6!} + \\frac{(ix)^7}{7!} + \\frac{(ix)^8}{8!} + \\cdots \\\\[8pt]\n &= 1 + ix - \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\frac{ix^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\frac{ix^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} - \\frac{ix^7}{7!} + \\frac{x^8}{8!} + \\cdots \\\\[8pt]\n &= \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} + \\frac{x^8}{8!} - \\cdots \\right) + i\\left( x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots \\right) \\\\[8pt]\n &= \\cos x + i\\sin x .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn the last step we have simply recognized the [[Taylor series|Maclaurin series]] for {{math|cos ''x''}} and {{math|sin ''x''}}. The rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\n===Using calculus===\nAnother proof<ref name=Strang>{{cite book |url=http://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-18-001-calculus-online-textbook-spring-2005/textbook/ |title=Calculus |first=Gilbert |last=Strang |page=389 |publisher=Wellesley-Cambridge |year=1991 |isbn=0-9614088-2-0}} Second proof on page.</ref> is based on the fact that all complex numbers can be expressed in polar coordinates. Therefore, for ''some'' {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''\u03b8''}} depending on {{math|''x''}},\n:<math>e^{ix} = r (\\cos \\theta + i \\sin \\theta).</math>\nNo assumptions are being made about {{mvar|r}} and {{mvar|\u03b8}}; they will be determined in the course of the proof. From any of the definitions of the exponential function it can be shown that the derivative of {{math|''e''<sup>''ix''</sup>}} is {{math|''ie''<sup>''ix''</sup>}}. Therefore, differentiating both sides gives\n:<math>i e ^{ix} = (\\cos \\theta  + i \\sin \\theta) \\frac{dr}{dx} + r (-\\sin \\theta  + i \\cos \\theta) \\frac{d\\theta}{dx}.</math>\nSubstituting {{math|''r''(cos ''\u03b8'' + ''i'' sin ''\u03b8'')}} for {{math|''e<sup>ix</sup>''}} and equating real and imaginary parts in this formula gives {{math|''{{sfrac|dr|dx}}'' {{=}} 0}} and {{math|''{{sfrac|d\u03b8|dx}}'' {{=}} 1}}. Thus, {{mvar|r}} is a constant, and {{mvar|\u03b8}} is {{math|''x'' + ''C''}} for some constant {{mvar|C}}. The initial values {{math|''r''(0) {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''\u03b8''(0) {{=}} 0}} come from {{math|''e''<sup>0''i''</sup> {{=}} 1}}, giving {{math|''r'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''\u03b8'' {{=}} ''x''}}. This proves the formula\n:<math>e^{ix} = 1(\\cos x +i \\sin x) = \\cos x + i \\sin x.</math>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Complex number]]\n* [[Euler's identity]]\n* [[Integration using Euler's formula]]\n* {{section link|History of Lorentz transformations|Euler's gap}}\n* [[List of things named after Leonhard Euler]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20110413234352/http://web.mat.bham.ac.uk/C.J.Sangwin/euler/ Elements of Algebra]\n*[http://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus/v/euler-s-formula-and-euler-s-identity Euler's Formula and Euler's Identity : Rationale for Euler's Formula and Euler's Identity, video at Khanacademy.org]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Theorems in complex analysis]]\n[[Category:Articles containing proofs]]\n[[Category:E (mathematical constant)]]\n[[Category:Leonhard Euler]]", "sha1": "gary8vju94z1996l11m7yc1y939jf21"}}, {"title": "Eductor-jet pump", "ns": "0", "id": "9614", "redirect": {"title": "Injector"}, "revision": {"id": "406002491", "parentid": "406000599", "timestamp": "2011-01-05T01:39:11Z", "contributor": {"username": "Incompetence", "id": "13410607"}, "comment": "same thing", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[injector]]", "sha1": "rf2tv07jywhca592tamthms6gl3dbye"}}, {"title": "\u00c9douard Manet", "ns": "0", "id": "9615", "revision": {"id": "866078916", "parentid": "864098494", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T03:18:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "Place portal link", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|19th-century French painter}}\n{{redirect|Manet}}\n{{distinguish|text=[[Claude Monet]], an Impressionist painter of the same era, friend of Manet}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{Infobox artist\n| name        = \u00c9douard Manet\n| image       = \u00c9douard Manet-crop.jpg\n| imagesize   = 200px\n| caption     = portrait by [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]], 1874\n| birth_date  = {{birth date|df=yes|1832|1|23}}\n| birth_place = [[Paris]], [[July Monarchy|France]]\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|df=yes|1883|4|30|1832|1|23}}\n| death_place = Paris, [[French Third Republic|France]]\n| field       = Painting, [[printmaking]]\n| training    = \n| movement    = [[realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Impressionism]]\n| works       = ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe)]]'', 1863<br>''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', 1863<br>''[[A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re]] (Le Bar aux Folies-Berg\u00e8re)'', 1882<br>''Young Flautist'' or ''[[The Fifer]] (Le Fifre)'', 1866\n| spouse      = [[Suzanne Leenhoff]]\n}}\n'''\u00c9douard Manet''' ({{IPAc-en|US|m|\u00e6|\u02c8|n|e\u026a|,_|m|\u0259|-}}; {{IPAc-en|UK|\u02c8|m|\u00e6|n|e\u026a}}; {{IPA-fr|edwa\u0281 man\u025b|lang}}; 23 January 1832&nbsp;\u2013 30 April 1883) was a French painter. He was one of the first 19th-century artists to paint modern life, and a pivotal figure in the transition from [[realism (arts)|Realism]] to [[Impressionism]].\n\nBorn into an upper-class household with strong political connections, Manet rejected the future originally envisioned for him, and became engrossed in the world of painting. His early masterworks, ''[[Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l\u2019herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe)]]'' and ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', both 1863, caused great controversy and served as rallying points for the young painters who would create Impressionism. Today, these are considered watershed paintings that mark the start of [[modern art]]. The last 20 years of Manet's life saw him form bonds with other great artists of the time, and develop his own style that would be heralded as innovative and serve as a major influence for future painters.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Manet par Fantin-Latour.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Manet's portrait painted by [[Fantin-Latour]]]]\n\u00c9douard Manet was born in Paris on 23 January 1832, in the ancestral [[h\u00f4tel particulier]] (mansion) on the rue des Petits Augustins (now [[rue Bonaparte]]) to an affluent and well-connected family.<ref>Neret, Gilles. ''Manet''. Taschen, 2003. p. 93. {{ISBN|3-8228-1949-2}}</ref> His mother, Eug\u00e9nie-Desir\u00e9e Fournier, was the daughter of a diplomat and goddaughter of the Swedish crown prince [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Charles Bernadotte]], from whom the Swedish monarchs are descended. His father, Auguste Manet, was a French judge who expected \u00c9douard to pursue a career in law. His uncle, Edmond Fournier, encouraged him to pursue painting and took young Manet to the [[Louvre]].<ref name = \"King\"/> In 1841 he enrolled at secondary school, the [[Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]]. In 1845, at the advice of his uncle, Manet enrolled in a special course of drawing where he met [[Antonin Proust]], future Minister of Fine Arts and subsequent lifelong friend.\n\nAt his father's suggestion, in 1848 he sailed on a training vessel to [[Rio de Janeiro]]. After he twice failed the examination to join the [[French Navy|Navy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/mane/hd_mane.htm |title=\u00c9douard Manet |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|date= |accessdate=22 July 2013}}</ref> his father relented to his wishes to pursue an art education. From 1850 to 1856, Manet studied under the academic painter [[Thomas Couture]]. In his spare time, Manet copied the [[Old Master]]s in the Louvre.\n\nFrom 1853 to 1856, Manet visited Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, during which time he was influenced by the Dutch painter [[Frans Hals]], and the Spanish artists [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] and [[Francisco Goya|Francisco Jos\u00e9 de Goya]].\n\n==Career==\nIn 1856, Manet opened a studio. His style in this period was characterized by loose brush strokes, simplification of details and the suppression of transitional tones. Adopting the current style of [[realism (arts)|realism]] initiated by [[Gustave Courbet]], he painted [[The Absinthe Drinker (Manet painting)|''The Absinthe Drinker'']] (1858\u201359) and other contemporary subjects such as beggars, singers, Gypsies, people in caf\u00e9s, and bullfights. After his early career, he rarely painted religious, mythological, or historical subjects; examples include his ''Christ Mocked'', now in the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], and ''Christ with Angels'', in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. Manet had two canvases accepted at the Salon in 1861. A portrait of his mother and father, who at the time was paralysed and robbed of speech by a stroke, was ill-received by critics. The other, ''[[The Spanish Singer]]'', was admired by [[Theophile Gautier]], and placed in a more conspicuous location as a result of its popularity with Salon-goers. Manet's work, which appeared  \"slightly slapdash\" when compared with the meticulous style of so many other Salon paintings, intrigued some young artists. ''The Spanish Singer'', painted in a \"strange new fashion [-] caused many painters' eyes to open and their jaws to drop.\"<ref>Ross King, The Judgement of Paris, p.20-21, from [[Fernand Desnoyers]], Le Salon des Refus\u00e9s, 1863</ref>\n\n===''Music in the Tuileries''===\n{{main|Music in the Tuileries}}\n[[File:MANET - M\u00fasica en las Tuller\u00edas (National Gallery, Londres, 1862).jpg|thumb|''[[Music in the Tuileries]]'', 1862]]\n''Music in the Tuileries'' is an early example of Manet's painterly style. Inspired by Hals and Vel\u00e1zquez, it is a harbinger of his lifelong interest in the subject of leisure.\n\nWhile the picture was regarded as unfinished by some,<ref name = \"King\"/> the suggested atmosphere imparts a sense of what the Tuileries gardens were like at the time; one may imagine the music and conversation.\n\nHere, Manet has depicted his friends, artists, authors, and musicians who take part, and he has included a self-portrait among the subjects.\n\n===''Luncheon on the Grass ''(''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe'')===\n{{Main|Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe}}\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]\nA major early work is ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass (Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe)]]'', originally ''Le Bain''. The [[Paris Salon]] rejected it for exhibition in 1863, but Manet agreed to exhibit it at the [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]] (Salon of the Rejected) which was a parallel exhibition to the official Salon, as an alternative exhibition in the Palais des Champs-Elys\u00e9e. The ''Salon des Refus\u00e9s'' was initiated by Emperor [[Napoleon III]] as a solution to a problematic situation which came about as the Selection Committee of the Salon that year rejected 2,783 paintings of the ca. 5000. Each painter could decide whether to take the opportunity to exhibit at the ''Salon des Refus\u00e9s'', less than 500 of the rejected painters chose to do so.\n\nManet employed model [[Victorine Meurent]], his wife Suzanne, future brother-in-law Ferdinand Leenhoff, and one of his brothers to pose. Meurent also posed for several more of Manet's important paintings including ''Olympia''; and by the mid-1870s she became an accomplished painter in her own right.\n\nThe painting's juxtaposition of fully dressed men and a nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling, an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]'s [[engraving]] of the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]'' (c. 1515) based on a drawing by [[Raphael]].<ref name = \"King\"/>\n\nTwo additional works cited by scholars as important precedents for ''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe'' are ''[[Pastoral Concert]]'' (c. 1510, [[The Louvre]]) and ''[[The Tempest (painting)|The Tempest]]'' ([[Gallerie dell'Accademia]], Venice), both of which are attributed variously to Italian [[Renaissance]] masters [[Giorgione]] or [[Titian]].<ref>Paul Hayes Tucker, ''Manet's Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe'', Cambridge University Press, 1998, pp.12\u201314. {{ISBN|0-521-47466-3}}.</ref> ''The Tempest'' is an enigmatic painting featuring a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting.

The painting is also reminiscent of [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting ''[[The Nude Maja]]'' (1800).\n\nManet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display.<!-- by whom? --> His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to [[Antonin Proust]], \"only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn\" by offended viewers.<ref>Neret, Gilles. ''Manet''. Taschen, 2003. p. 22. {{ISBN|3-8228-1949-2}}</ref> The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, [[black cat]], and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by [[Ukiyo-e|Japanese wood block]] art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed.<ref name = \"King\"/> That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here furthers the sexual tension of the piece.\n\nOlympia's body as well as her gaze is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia's \"shamelessly flexed\" left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian's Venus.<ref>Hunter, Dianne. ''Seduction and theory: readings of gender, representation, and rhetoric''. University of Illinois Press, 1989. p. 19. {{ISBN|0-252-06063-6}}.</ref> Likewise, the alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's portrayal of the goddess in his ''Venus of Urbino''.\n\n''Olympia'' was the subject of caricatures in the popular press, but was championed by the French avant-garde community, and the painting's significance was appreciated by artists such as [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], [[Claude Monet]], and later [[Paul Gauguin]].\n\nAs with ''Luncheon on the Grass'', the painting raised the issue of prostitution within contemporary France and the roles of women within society.<ref name=\"King\">Ross King.

Leenhoff was a Dutch-born piano teacher two years Manet's senior with whom he had been romantically involved for approximately ten years. Leenhoff initially had been employed by Manet's father, Auguste, to teach Manet and his younger brother piano. She also may have been Auguste's mistress. In 1852, Leenhoff gave birth, out of wedlock, to a son, Leon Koella Leenhoff. Manet painted his wife in ''[[The Reading]]'', among other paintings.\n\nEleven-year-old Leon Leenhoff, whose father may have been either of the Manets, posed often for Manet. Most famously, he is the subject of the ''[[Boy Carrying a Sword]]'' of 1861 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). He also appears as the boy carrying a tray in the background of ''[[The Balcony (painting)|The Balcony]]''.<ref>Mauner, G. L., & Loyrette, H. ''Manet: the still-life paintings''. New York: H.N. Abrams in association with the American Federation of Arts, 2000. p. 66. {{ISBN|0-8109-4391-3}}.</ref>\n\nHe became friends with the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] [[Edgar Degas]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]] and [[Camille Pissarro]] through another painter, [[Berthe Morisot]], who was a member of the group and drew him into their activities. The supposed grand-niece of the painter [[Jean-Honor\u00e9 Fragonard]], Morisot had her first painting accepted in the [[Salon de Paris]] in 1864, and she continued to show in the salon for the next ten years.\n\nManet became the friend and colleague of Berthe Morisot in 1868. She is credited with convincing Manet to attempt [[plein air]] painting, which she had been practicing since she was introduced to it by another friend of hers, [[Camille Corot]]. They had a reciprocating relationship and Manet incorporated some of her techniques into his paintings. In 1874, she became his sister-in-law when she married his brother, [[Eug\u00e8ne Manet|Eug\u00e8ne]].\n\n[[File:Edouard Manet 060.jpg|left|thumbnail|upright|''[[Self-Portrait with Palette (Manet)|Self-Portrait with Palette]]'', 1879]]\n\nOne of Manet's frequent models, especially at the beginning of the 1880s, was the \"semimondaine\" [[M\u00e9ry Laurent]], who frequently sat for various other Impressionists.\n\nUnlike the core Impressionist group, Manet maintained that modern artists should seek to exhibit at the [[Paris Salon]] rather than abandon it in favor of independent exhibitions. Nevertheless, when Manet was excluded from the International Exhibition of 1867, he set up his own exhibition. His mother worried that he would waste all his inheritance on this project, which was enormously expensive. While the exhibition earned poor reviews from the major critics, it also provided his first contacts with several future Impressionist painters, including Degas.\n\nAlthough his own work influenced and anticipated the Impressionist style, he resisted involvement in Impressionist exhibitions, partly because he did not wish to be seen as the representative of a group identity, and partly because he preferred to exhibit at the Salon. [[Eva Gonzal\u00e8s]], a daughter of the novelist [[Emmanuel Gonzal\u00e8s]], was his only formal student.\n\nHe was influenced by the Impressionists, especially Monet and Morisot. Their influence is seen in Manet's use of lighter colors: after the early 1870s he made less use of dark backgrounds but retained his distinctive use of black, uncharacteristic of Impressionist painting. He painted many outdoor (plein air) pieces, but always returned to what he considered the serious work of the studio.\n\nManet enjoyed a close friendship with composer [[Emmanuel Chabrier]], painting two portraits of him; the musician owned 14 of Manet's paintings and dedicated his ''Impromptu'' to Manet's wife.<ref>Delage, R. ''Emmanuel Chabrier''. Paris: Fayard, 1999. Chapter XI examines in detail their relationship and the effects of each other on their work.</ref>\n\nThroughout his life, although resisted by art critics, Manet could number as his champions [[\u00c9mile Zola]], who supported him publicly in the press, [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], and [[Charles Baudelaire]], who challenged him to depict life as it was. Manet, in turn, drew or painted each of them.\n\n===Cafe scenes===\n[[File:Edouard Manet - At the Caf\u00e9 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Cafe Concert'', 1878.  Scene set in the Cabaret de Reichshoffen on the Boulevard Rochechouart, where women on the fringes of society freely intermingled with well-heeled gentlemen.<ref>{{cite web |publisher= [[The Walters Art Museum]]\n |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/16473\n |title=At the Caf\u00e9}}</ref> The Walters Art Museum.]]\n\nManet's paintings of caf\u00e9 scenes are observations of social life in 19th-century Paris. People are depicted drinking beer, listening to music, flirting, reading, or waiting. Many of these paintings were based on sketches executed on the spot. He often visited the Brasserie Reichshoffen on boulevard de Rochechourt, upon which he based ''At the Cafe'' in 1878. Several people are at the bar, and one woman confronts the viewer while others wait to be served. Such depictions represent the painted journal of a [[fl\u00e2neur]]. These are painted in a style which is loose, referencing [[Frans Hals|Hals]] and [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez|Vel\u00e1zquez]], yet they capture the mood and feeling of Parisian night life. They are painted snapshots of [[bohemianism]], urban [[working people]], as well as some of the [[bourgeoisie]].\n\nIn ''Corner of a Cafe Concert'', a man smokes while behind him a waitress serves drinks. In ''The Beer Drinkers'' a woman enjoys her beer in the company of a friend. In ''The Cafe Concert'', shown at right, a sophisticated gentleman sits at a bar while a waitress stands resolutely in the background, sipping her drink. In ''The Waitress'', a serving woman pauses for a moment behind a seated customer smoking a pipe, while a ballet dancer, with arms extended as she is about to turn, is on stage in the background.\n\nManet also sat at the restaurant on the [[Avenue de Clichy]] called Pere Lathuille's, which had a garden in addition to the dining area. One of the paintings he produced here was ''Chez le p\u00e8re Lathuille'' (At Pere Lathuille's), in which a man displays an unrequited interest in a woman dining near him.\n\nIn ''Le Bon Bock'' (1873), a large, cheerful, bearded man sits with a pipe in one hand and a glass of beer in the other, looking straight at the viewer.\n\n===Paintings of social activities===\n[[File:Edouard Manet 053.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The Races at Longchamp]]'', 1864]]\n\nManet painted the upper class enjoying more formal social activities. In ''Masked Ball at the Opera'', Manet shows a lively crowd of people enjoying a party. Men stand with top hats and long black suits while talking to women with masks and costumes. He included portraits of his friends in this picture.\n\nHis 1868 painting ''[[The Luncheon]]'' was posed in the dining room of the Manet house.\n\nManet depicted other popular activities in his work. In ''[[The Races at Longchamp]]'', an unusual perspective is employed to underscore the furious energy of racehorses as they rush toward the viewer. In ''Skating'', Manet shows a well dressed woman in the foreground, while others skate behind her. Always there is the sense of active urban life continuing behind the subject, extending outside the frame of the canvas.\n\nIn ''View of the International Exhibition'', soldiers relax, seated and standing, prosperous couples are talking.

The least finished of three large canvases devoted to the execution of [[Maximilian I of Mexico]].]]\n[[File:TheBaricade.jpg|thumb|upright|''The Barricade (Civil War)'', 1871, ink, watercolor, and gouache on paper, [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)]]]]\n\nManet's response to modern life included works devoted to war, in subjects that may be seen as updated interpretations of the genre of \"history painting\".<ref>Krell, Alan, ''Manet and the Painters of Contemporary Life'', page 83. Thames and Hudson, 1996.</ref> The first such work was the ''Battle of the Kearsarge and Alabama'' (1864), a sea skirmish known as the ''[[Battle of Cherbourg (1864)|Battle of Cherbourg]]'' from the [[American Civil War]] which took place off the French coast, and may have been witnessed by the artist.<ref>Krell, pages 84\u20136.</ref>\n\nOf interest next was the French intervention in Mexico; from 1867 to 1869 Manet painted three versions of the ''[[Execution of Emperor Maximilian]]'', an event which raised concerns regarding French foreign and domestic policy.<ref>Krell, pages 87\u201391.</ref> The several versions of the ''Execution'' are among Manet's largest paintings, which suggests that the theme was one which the painter regarded as most important. Its subject is the execution by Mexican firing squad of a Habsburg emperor who had been installed by [[Napoleon III]]. Neither the paintings nor a [[lithograph]] of the subject were permitted to be shown in France.<ref>Krell, page 91.</ref> As an indictment of formalized slaughter [[The Third of May 1808|the paintings look back]] to [[Francisco Goya|Goya]],<ref>Krell, page 89.</ref> and anticipate [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''.\n\nIn January 1871, Manet traveled to [[Oloron-Sainte-Marie]] in the [[Pyrenees]]. In his absence his friends added his name to the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des artistes\" (see: [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]]) of the [[Paris Commune]]. Manet stayed away from Paris, perhaps, until after the ''semaine sanglante'': in a letter to [[Berthe Morisot]] at [[Cherbourg]] (10 June 1871) he writes, ''\"We came back to Paris a few days ago...\"'' (the semaine sanglante ended on 28 May).\n\nThe prints and drawings collection of the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)]] has a [[watercolour]]/[[gouache]] by Manet, ''The Barricade'', depicting a summary execution of [[Communards]] by Versailles troops based on a [[lithograph]] of the execution of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]]. A similar piece, ''The Barricade'' (oil on plywood), is held by a private collector.\n\nOn 18 March 1871, he wrote to his (confederate) friend [[F\u00e9lix Bracquemond]] in Paris about his visit to [[Bordeaux]], the provisory seat of the French National Assembly of the [[Third French Republic]] where [[\u00c9mile Zola]] introduced him to the sites: ''\"I never imagined that France could be represented by such doddering old fools, not excepting that little twit [[Adolphe Thiers|Thiers]]...\"''<ref>[[Juliet Wilson-Bareau]], ed., ''Manet by himself'', UK: Little Brown, 2004</ref> If this could be interpreted as support of the Commune, a following letter to Bracquemond (21 March 1871) expressed his idea more clearly: ''\"Only party hacks and the ambitious, the Henrys of this world following on the heels of the Milli\u00e9res, the grotesque imitators of the Commune of 1793...\"'' He knew the communard Lucien Henry to have been a former painter's model and Milli\u00e8re, an insurance agent. ''\"What an encouragement all these bloodthirsty caperings are for the arts! But there is at least one consolation in our misfortunes: that we're not politicians and have no desire to be elected as deputies\"''.\n\n===Paris===<!--Section linked from [[Victorine Meurent]]-->\nManet depicted many scenes of the streets of Paris in his works. The ''Rue Mosnier Decked with Flags'' depicts red, white, and blue pennants covering buildings on either side of the street; another painting of the same title features a one-legged man walking with crutches. Again depicting the same street, but this time in a different context, is ''Rue Mosnier with Pavers'', in which men repair the roadway while people and horses move past.\n\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Le Chemin de fer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left| ''The Railway'', 1873]]\n''[[The Railway]]'', widely known as ''The Gare Saint-Lazare'', was painted in 1873. The setting is the urban [[landscape]] of Paris in the late 19th century. Using his favorite model in his last painting of her, a fellow painter, [[Victorine Meurent]], also the model for ''Olympia'' and the ''Luncheon on the Grass'', sits before an iron fence holding a sleeping puppy and an open book in her lap. Next to her is a little girl with her back to the painter, watching a train pass beneath them.\n\nInstead of choosing the traditional natural view as background for an outdoor scene, Manet opts for the iron grating which \"boldly stretches across the canvas\"<ref>Gay, p. 106.</ref> The only evidence of the train is its white cloud of steam. In the distance, modern apartment buildings are seen. This arrangement compresses the foreground into a narrow focus. The traditional convention of deep space is ignored.\n\nHistorian Isabelle Dervaux has described the reception this painting received when it was first exhibited at the official Paris Salon of 1874: \"Visitors and critics found its subject baffling, its composition incoherent, and its execution sketchy. [[caricature|Caricaturists]] ridiculed Manet's picture, in which only a few recognized the symbol of modernity that it has become today\".<ref>Adams, Katherine H.; Michael L. Keene.

One was \u00c9mile Zola, who wrote in 1867: \"We are not accustomed to seeing such simple and direct translations of reality. Then, as I said, there is such a surprisingly elegant awkwardness ... it is a truly charming experience to contemplate this luminous and serious painting which interprets nature with a gentle brutality.\"<ref>Manet, \u00c9douard, Mary Anne Stevens, and Lawrence W.

Toledo: Toledo Museum of Art. 2012. p. 168. {{ISBN|9781907533532}}</ref>\n\nThe roughly painted style and photographic lighting in Manet's paintings was seen as specifically modern, and as a challenge to the Renaissance works he copied or used as source material. He rejected the technique he had learned in the studio of [[Thomas Couture]] \u2013 in which a painting was constructed using successive layers of paint on a dark-toned ground \u2013 in favor of a direct, ''alla prima'' method using opaque paint on a light ground. Novel at the time, this method made possible the completion of a painting in a single sitting. It was adopted by the Impressionists, and became the prevalent method of painting in oils for generations that followed.<ref name=\"Farwell\">Farwell, Beatrice. \"Manet, Edouard.\" ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web.</ref> Manet's work is considered \"early modern\", partially because of the opaque flatness of his surfaces, the frequent sketchlike passages, and the black outlining of figures, all of which draw attention to the surface of the picture plane and the material quality of paint.\n\nThe art historian Beatrice Farwell says Manet \"has been universally regarded as the Father of Modernism. With Courbet he was among the first to take serious risks with the public whose favour he sought, the first to make ''alla prima'' painting the standard technique for oil painting and one of the first to take liberties with Renaissance perspective and to offer \u2018pure painting\u2019 as a source of aesthetic pleasure. He was a pioneer, again with Courbet, in the rejection of humanistic and historical subject-matter, and shared with Degas the establishment of modern urban life as acceptable material for high art.\"<ref name=\"Farwell\"/>\n\n===Art market===\nThe late Manet painting, ''[[Spring (Manet)|Le Printemps]]'' (1881), sold to the [[J.

Since then, it has been widely used in the social sciences, including [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[philosophy]], and [[political science]].\n* In the social sciences, the primary interest is not in an ESS as the end of [[biological]] evolution, but as an end point in [[cultural evolution]] or individual learning.<ref name=\"AlexanderSEP\">{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-evolutionary/ |title=Evolutionary Game Theory |accessdate=31 August 2007 |last1=Alexander|first1=Jason McKenzie |date=23 May 2003 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>\n* In [[evolutionary psychology]], ESS is used primarily as a model for [[human evolution|human biological evolution]].\n\n==Motivation==\n\nThe [[Nash equilibrium]] is the traditional [[solution concept]] in [[game theory]]. It depends on the cognitive abilities of the players. It is assumed that players are aware of the [[extensive form|structure of the game]] and consciously try to predict the [[Move (game theory)|moves]] of their opponents and to maximize their own [[Payoff (game theory)|payoffs]]. In addition, it is presumed that all the players know this (see [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]]).  These assumptions are then used to explain why players choose Nash equilibrium strategies.\n\nEvolutionarily stable strategies are motivated entirely differently.  Here, it is presumed that the players' strategies are biologically encoded and [[heritable]].  Individuals have no control over their strategy and need not be aware of the game.  They reproduce and are subject to the forces of [[natural selection]], with the payoffs of the game representing reproductive success (biological [[fitness (biology)|fitness]]). It is imagined that alternative strategies of the game occasionally occur, via a process like [[mutation]]. To be an ESS, a strategy must be resistant to these alternatives.\n\nGiven the radically different motivating assumptions, it may come as a surprise that ESSes and Nash equilibria often coincide. In fact, every ESS corresponds to a Nash equilibrium, but some Nash equilibria are not ESSes.\n\n== Nash equilibrium ==\n<!--\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Harm thy neighbor\n                | 2L = A     | 2R = B    |\n1U = A          | UL = 2, 2  | UR = 1, 2 |\n1D = B          | DL = 2, 1  | DR = 2, 2 }}\n-->\n\nAn ESS is a [[solution concept|refined]] or modified form of a Nash equilibrium. (See the next section for examples which contrast the two.) In a Nash equilibrium, if all players adopt their respective parts, no player can ''benefit'' by switching to any alternative strategy. In a two player game, it is a strategy pair. Let E(''S'',''T'') represent the payoff for playing strategy ''S'' against strategy ''T''.  The strategy pair (''S'', ''S'') is a Nash equilibrium in a two player game if and only if this is true for both players and for all ''T''\u2260''S'':\n:E(''S'',''S'') \u2265 E(''T'',''S'')\n\nIn this definition, strategy ''T'' can be a neutral alternative to ''S'' (scoring equally well, but not better). \n<!--For example, in ''Harm thy neighbour'', (''A'', ''A'') is a Nash equilibrium because one cannot do ''better'' by switching to ''B''. **will move this to \"comparison\" section, trying to avoid mixing A&B and S&T strategies in same paragraph -->\nA Nash equilibrium is presumed to be stable even if ''T'' scores equally, on the assumption that there is no long-term incentive for players to adopt ''T'' instead of ''S''.  This fact represents the point of departure of the ESS.\n\n[[John Maynard Smith|Maynard Smith]] and [[George R. Price|Price]]<ref name=\"JMSandP73\"/> specify two conditions for a strategy ''S'' to be an ESS.  For all ''T''\u2260''S'', either\n# E(''S'',''S'') > E(''T'',''S''), '''or'''\n# E(''S'',''S'') = E(''T'',''S'') and E(''S'',''T'') > E(''T'',''T'')\n\nThe first condition is sometimes called a ''strict'' Nash equilibrium.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01737572 |author=Harsanyi, J |authorlink=John Harsanyi |title=Oddness of the number of equilibrium points: a new proof |journal=Int. J. Game Theory |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=235\u201350 |year=1973 }}</ref> The second is sometimes called \"Maynard Smith's second condition\". The second condition means that although strategy ''T'' is neutral with respect to the payoff against strategy ''S'', the population of players who continue to play strategy ''S'' has an advantage when playing against ''T''.\n\nThere is also an alternative, stronger definition of ESS, due to Thomas.<ref name=\"Thomas85\">{{cite journal |author=Thomas, B. |title=On evolutionarily stable sets |journal=J. Math. Biology |volume=22 |pages=105\u2013115 |year=1985 |doi=10.1007/bf00276549}}</ref>  This places a different emphasis on the role of the Nash equilibrium concept in the ESS concept.  Following the terminology given in the first definition above, this definition requires that for all ''T''\u2260''S''\n\n# E(''S'',''S'') \u2265 E(''T'',''S''), '''and'''\n# E(''S'',''T'') > E(''T'',''T'')\n\nIn this formulation, the first condition specifies that the strategy is a Nash equilibrium, and the second specifies that Maynard Smith's second condition is met. Note that the two definitions are not precisely equivalent: for example, each pure strategy in the coordination game below is an ESS by the first definition but not the second.\n\nIn words, this definition looks like this: The payoff of the first player when both players play strategy S is higher than (or equal to) the payoff of the first player when he changes to another strategy T and the second players keeps his strategy S  ''and'' the payoff of the first player when only his opponent changes his strategy to T is higher than his payoff in case that both of players change their strategies to T.\n\nThis formulation more clearly highlights the role of the Nash equilibrium condition in the ESS. It also allows for a natural definition of related concepts such as a [[weak ESS]] or an [[evolutionarily stable set]].<ref name=\"Thomas85\"/>\n\n===Examples of differences between Nash equilibria and ESSes===\n\n{|align=block\n|-\n|{{Payoff matrix | Name =  Prisoner's Dilemma\n                | 2L =  Cooperate    | 2R = Defect  |\n1U =  Cooperate | UL = 3, 3       | UR = 1, 4       |\n1D =  Defect   | DL = 4, 1       | DR = 2, 2       }}\n|{{Payoff matrix | Name =  Harm thy neighbor\n                | 2L = A     | 2R = B    |\n1U = A          | UL = 2, 2  | UR = 1, 2 |\n1D = B          | DL = 2, 1  | DR = 2, 2 }}\n|}\n\nIn most simple games, the ESSes and Nash equilibria coincide perfectly.  For instance, in the [[prisoner's dilemma]] there is only one Nash equilibrium, and its strategy (''Defect'') is also an ESS.\n\nSome games may have Nash equilibria that are not ESSes. For example, in [[harm thy neighbor]] (whose payoff matrix is shown here) both (''A'', ''A'') and (''B'', ''B'') are Nash equilibria, since players cannot do better by switching away from either.  However, only ''B'' is an ESS (and a strong Nash). ''A'' is not an ESS, so ''B'' can neutrally invade a population of ''A'' strategists and predominate, because ''B'' scores higher against ''B'' than ''A'' does against ''B''.  This dynamic is captured by Maynard Smith's second condition, since E(''A'', ''A'') = E(''B'', ''A''), but it is not the case that E(''A'',''B'') > E(''B'',''B'').\n\n{|align=block style=\"clear: right\"\n|-\n|{{Payoff matrix | Name = Harm everyone\n                | 2L = C     | 2R = D    |\n1U = C          | UL = 2, 2  | UR = 1, 2 |\n1D = D          | DL = 2, 1  | DR = 0, 0 }}\n|{{Payoff matrix | Name = Chicken\n                | 2L = Swerve     | 2R = Stay       |\n1U = Swerve     | UL = 0,0        | UR = \u22121,+1      |\n1D = Stay       | DL = +1,\u22121      | DR = \u221220,\u221220    }}\n|}\n\nNash equilibria with equally scoring alternatives can be ESSes.  For example, in the game ''Harm everyone'', ''C'' is an ESS because it satisfies Maynard Smith's second condition. ''D'' strategists may temporarily invade a population of ''C'' strategists by scoring equally well against ''C'', but they pay a price when they begin to play against each other; ''C'' scores better against ''D'' than does ''D''.  So here although E(''C'', ''C'') = E(''D'', ''C''), it is also the case that E(''C'',''D'') > E(''D'',''D'').  As a result, ''C'' is an ESS.\n\nEven if a game has pure strategy Nash equilibria, it might be that none of those pure strategies are ESS. Consider the [[Chicken (game)|Game of chicken]].  There are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game (''Swerve'', ''Stay'') and (''Stay'', ''Swerve''). However, in the absence of an [[uncorrelated asymmetry]], neither ''Swerve'' nor ''Stay'' are ESSes. There is a third Nash equilibrium, a [[mixed strategy]] which is an ESS for this game (see [[Chicken (game)|Hawk-dove game]] and [[Best response]] for explanation).\n\nThis last example points to an important difference between Nash equilibria and ESS.  Nash equilibria are defined on ''strategy sets'' (a specification of a strategy for each player), while ESS are defined in terms of strategies themselves.  The equilibria defined by ESS must always be [[Symmetric equilibrium|symmetric]], and thus have fewer equilibrium points.\n\n== Vs. evolutionarily stable state ==\nIn population biology, the two concepts of an ''evolutionarily stable strategy'' (ESS) and an ''[[evolutionarily stable state]]'' are closely linked but describe different situations.\n\nIn an evolutionarily stable ''strategy,'' if all the members of a population adopt it, no mutant strategy can invade.<ref name=\"JMS82\"/> Once virtually all members of the population use this strategy, there is no 'rational' alternative. ESS is part of classical [[game theory]].\n\nIn an evolutionarily stable ''state,'' a population's genetic composition is restored by selection after a disturbance, if the disturbance is not too large. An evolutionarily stable state is a dynamic property of a population that returns to using a strategy, or mix of strategies, if it is perturbed from that initial state. It is part of [[population genetics]], [[dynamical system]], or [[evolutionary game theory]]. This is now called convergent stability.<ref>{{Cite journal|authors=Apaloo, J.; Brown, J. S.; Vincent, T. L. |date=2009 |title=Evolutionary game theory: ESS, convergence stability, and NIS |url=http://www.evolutionary-ecology.com/abstracts/v11/2445.html |journal=Evolutionary Ecology Research |volume=11 |pages=489-515}}</ref>\n\nB. Thomas (1984) applies the term ESS to an individual strategy which may be mixed, and evolutionarily stable population state to a population mixture of pure strategies which may be formally equivalent to the mixed ESS.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0040-5809(84)90023-6 |author=Thomas, B. |title=Evolutionary stability: states and strategies |journal=Theor.

In finite populations, any mutant could in principle invade, albeit at low probability, implying that no ESS can exist. In a finite population, an ESS can instead be defined as a strategy which, should it become invaded by a new mutant strategy with probability p, would be able to counterinvade from a single starting individual with probability >p, as illustrated by the evolution of [[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet-hedging]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=King |first=Oliver D. |author2=Masel, Joanna |author2link=Joanna Masel |title=The evolution of bet-hedging adaptations to rare scenarios |journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=1 December 2007 |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=560\u2013575 |doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2007.08.006 |pmid=17915273 |pmc=2118055}}</ref>\n\n== Prisoner's dilemma ==\n{{Payoff matrix | Name = Prisoner's Dilemma\n                | 2L = Cooperate  | 2R = Defect     |\n1U = Cooperate  | UL = 3, 3       | UR = 1, 4       |\n1D = Defect     | DL = 4, 1       | DR = 2, 2       }}\n\nA common model of [[altruism]] and social cooperation is the [[Prisoner's dilemma]].  Here a group of players would collectively be better off if they could play ''Cooperate'', but since ''Defect'' fares better each individual player has an incentive to play ''Defect''.  One solution to this problem is to introduce the possibility of retaliation by having individuals play the game repeatedly against the same player.  In the so-called ''[[repeated game|iterated]]'' Prisoner's dilemma, the same two individuals play the prisoner's dilemma over and over.  While the Prisoner's dilemma has only two strategies (''Cooperate'' and ''Defect''), the iterated Prisoner's dilemma has a huge number of possible strategies.  Since an individual can have different contingency plan for each history and the game may be repeated an indefinite number of times, there may in fact be an infinite number of such contingency plans.\n\nThree simple contingency plans which have received substantial attention are ''Always Defect'', ''Always Cooperate'', and ''[[Tit for Tat]]''.  The first two strategies do the same thing regardless of the other player's actions, while the latter responds on the next round by doing what was done to it on the previous round\u2014it responds to ''Cooperate'' with ''Cooperate'' and ''Defect'' with ''Defect''.\n\nIf the entire population plays ''Tit-for-Tat'' and a mutant arises who plays ''Always Defect'', ''Tit-for-Tat'' will outperform ''Always Defect''.  If the population of the mutant becomes too large \u2014 the percentage of the mutant will be kept small. ''Tit for Tat'' is therefore an ESS, ''with respect to '''only''' these two strategies''.  On the other hand, an island of ''Always Defect'' players will be stable against the invasion of a few ''Tit-for-Tat'' players, but not against a large number of them.<ref>{{cite book |author=Axelrod, Robert |authorlink=Robert Axelrod |title=[[The Evolution of Cooperation]] |year=1984 |isbn=0-465-02121-2 }}</ref>  If we introduce ''Always Cooperate'', a population of ''Tit-for-Tat'' is no longer an ESS.  Since a population of ''Tit-for-Tat'' players always cooperates, the strategy ''Always Cooperate'' behaves identically in this population.  As a result, a mutant who plays ''Always Cooperate'' will not be eliminated. However, even though a population of ''Always Cooperate'' and ''Tit-for-Tat'' can coexist, if there is a small percentage of the population that is ''Always Defect'', the selective pressure is against ''Always Cooperate'', and in favour of ''Tit-for-Tat''. This is due to the lower payoffs of cooperating than those of defecting in case the opponent defects.\n\nThis demonstrates the difficulties in applying the formal definition of an ESS to games with large strategy spaces, and has motivated some to consider alternatives.\n\n== Human behavior ==\nThe fields of [[sociobiology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]] attempt to explain animal and human behavior and social structures, largely in terms of evolutionarily stable strategies. [[Psychopathy#Sociopathy|Sociopathy]] (chronic antisocial or criminal behavior) may be a result of a combination of two such strategies.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00039595 |author=Mealey, L. |title=The sociobiology of sociopathy: An integrated evolutionary model |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=18 |issue=03 |pages=523\u201399 |year=1995 |url=http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021026131543/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/OldArchive/bbs.mealey.html |archivedate=2002-10-26 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEvolutionarily stable strategies were originally considered for biological evolution, but they can apply to other contexts. In fact, there are stable states for a large class of [[adaptive dynamics]]. As a result, they can be used to explain human behaviours that lack any genetic influences.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Antipredator adaptation]]\n*[[Behavioral ecology]]\n*[[Evolutionary psychology]]\n*[[Fitness landscape]]\n*[[Hawk-Dove game]]\n*[[Koinophilia]]\n*[[Sociobiology]]\n*[[War of attrition (game)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0040-5809(87)90029-3 | last1 = Hines | first1 = W.

Psychrophilic organisms live in environments at temperature below -15&nbsp;\u00b0C. Low temperatures cause the energy within proteins to slow, which prevents them from functioning.  Their proteins have adapted their amino acid composition to live in  cold conditions. They have a high amount of [[glycine]] amino acids, which small size allows for more flexibility within the protein once it is folded. Psychrophiles also have a low concentration of charged amino acids, hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids, and proline residues. The low amount of charged amino acids reduces the amount of interactions between them, while the reduced amount of hydrophobic (non-polar) amino acids allows the non-polar core of the protein to be smaller. Psychrophilic proteins have a small amount of [[proline]] amino acids because they cause a rigid structure. These adaptations allow psychrophilic proteins to be more flexible so they do not freeze under cold conditions.<ref name='Reed 2013'/>\n\n; [[Radioresistant]]: Organisms resistant to high levels of [[ionizing radiation]], most commonly ultraviolet radiation, but also including organisms capable of resisting nuclear radiation\n\n; [[Thermophile]]: An organism that can thrive at temperatures between 45\u2013122&nbsp;\u00b0C. Normally high temperatures cause proteins to unfold and prevent them from functioning; thermophilic proteins have adapted their proteins to cope with these conditions. They have a higher amount of [[cysteine]] amino acids, which form [[disulfide bond]]s once the protein has folded. These disulfide bonds cause the protein to fold up tighter and become more rigid. They also have more charged amino acids, both positive and negative, that interact with each other to increase how rigid the protein is. When proteins become more rigid they are less likely to unfold due to high temperature. Even one extra disulfide bond can raise the temperature at which the protein folds by 6&nbsp;\u00b0C.

Historically, reforms have taken different forms because the motivations of reformers have differed. However, since the 1980s, education reform has been focused on changing the existing system from one focused on inputs to one focused on outputs (i.e., student achievement). In the United States, education reform acknowledges and encourages public education as the primary source of K-12 education for American youth. {{clarify span|Education reformers desire to make public education into a market (in the form of an input-output system), where accountability creates high-stakes from curriculum standards tied to standardized tests.<ref>http://parentreolution.org/who-we-are/{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfer.org/about/principles/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026044818/http://www.dfer.org/about/principles/ |archivedate=2014-10-26 |df= }}</ref>\nAs a result of this input-output system, equality has been conceptualized as an end point, which is often evidenced by an achievement gap among diverse populations.<ref>http://www.edtrust.org/issues/pre-k-12/closing-the-gaps</ref> \nThis conceptualization of education reform is based on the market-logic of competition.  As a consequence, competition creates inequality which has continued to drive the market-logic of equality at an end point by reproduce the achievement gap among diverse youth.|date=October 2018}}\nThe one constant for all forms of education reform includes the idea that small changes in education will have large social returns in citizen health, wealth and well-being. For example, a stated motivation has been to reduce cost to students and society. From ancient times until the 1800s, one goal was to reduce the expense of a [[Liberal arts education|classical education]]. Ideally, classical education is undertaken with a highly educated full-time (extremely expensive) personal tutor. Historically, this was available only to the most wealthy. [[Encyclopedia]]s, [[Public Library|public libraries]] and [[grammar school]]s are examples of innovations intended to lower the cost of a classical education.\n\nRelated reforms attempted to develop similar classical results by concentrating on \"why\", and \"which\" questions neglected by classical education. Abstract, introspective answers to these questions can theoretically compress large numbers of facts into relatively few principles. This path was taken by some [[Transcendentalist]] educators, such as [[Amos Bronson Alcott]].\nIn the early modern age, [[grammar school#Victorian grammar schools|Victorian schools]] were reformed to teach commercially useful topics, such as modern languages and mathematics, rather than classical subjects, such as [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].\n\nMany reformers focused on reforming society by reforming education on more scientific, humanistic, pragmatic or democratic principles. [[John Dewey#On education|John Dewey]] and [[Anton Makarenko]] are prominent examples of such reformers. Some reformers incorporated several motivations, e.g. [[Maria Montessori]], who both \"educated for peace\" (a social goal), and to \"meet the needs of the child\" (A humanistic goal). In historic Prussia, an important motivation for the invention of [[Kindergarten]] was to foster national unity by teaching a national language while children were young enough that learning a language was easy.\n\nReform has taken many forms and directions. Throughout history and the present day, the meaning and methods of education have changed through debates over what content or experiences result in an educated individual or an educated society. Changes may be implemented by individual educators and/or by broad-based school organization and/or by [[curriculum development|curriculum changes]] with performance evaluations.\n\n==History==\n\n===Classical times===\n\n[[Plato]] believed that children would never learn unless they wanted to learn. In ''[[Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', he said, \" ... compulsory learning never sticks in the mind.\"\nAn educational debate in the time of the [[Roman Empire]] arose after Christianity had achieved broad acceptance. The question concerned the educational value of pre-Christian classical thought: \"Given that the body of knowledge of the pre-Christian Romans was heathen in origin, was it safe to teach it to Christian children?\" {{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Modern reforms===\n\nThough educational reform occurred on a local level at various points throughout history, the modern notion of education reform is tied with the spread of [[compulsory education]].  Education reforms did not become widespread until after organized schooling was sufficiently systematized to be 'reformed.'\n\nIn the modern world, economic growth and the spread of democracy have raised the value of education and increased the importance of ensuring that all children and adults have access to high-quality, effective education. Modern education reforms are increasingly driven by a growing understanding of what works in education and how to go about successfully improving teaching and learning in schools.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned (2009)</ref>  However, in some cases, the reformers' goals of \"high-quality education\" has meant \"high-intensity education\", with a narrow emphasis on teaching individual, test-friendly subskills quickly, regardless of long-term outcomes, developmental appropriateness, or broader educational goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2014/02/01/the-trouble-with-calls-for-universal-high-quality-pre-k/|title=The trouble with calls for universal \u2018high-quality\u2019 pre-K|last=Kohn|first=Alfie|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-05-26}}</ref>\n\n===Reforms of classical education===\n\nWestern [[Classical education movement|classical education]] as taught from the 18th to the 19th century has missing features that inspired reformers. Classical education is most concerned with answering the who, what, where, and when? questions that concern a majority of students. Unless carefully taught, group instruction naturally neglects the theoretical \"why\" and \"which\" questions that strongly concern fewer students.\n\nClassical education in this period also did not teach local ([[vernacular]]) languages and cultures. Instead it taught high-status ancient languages (Greek and Latin) and their cultures. This produced odd social effects in which an intellectual class might be more loyal to ancient cultures and institutions than to their native vernacular languages and their actual governing authorities.\n\n===England in the 19th century===\nBefore there were government-funded public schools, education of the lower classes was by the charity school, pioneered in the 19th century by [[Protestant]] organizations and adapted by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and governments. Because these schools operated on very small budgets and attempted to serve as many needy children as possible, they were designed to be inexpensive.\n\nThe basic program was to develop \"grammar\" schools. These taught only grammar and [[bookkeeping]]. This program permitted people to start businesses to make money, and gave them the skills to continue their education inexpensively from books. \"Grammar\" was the first third of the then-prevalent system of [[Classical education movement|classical education]].\n\n[[File:Joseph Lancaster by John Hazlitt.jpg|thumb|190px|Joseph Lancaster]]\nThe ultimate development of the grammar school was by [[Joseph Lancaster]] and [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] who developed the [[monitorial system]]. Lancaster started as a poor [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] in early 19th century London. Bell started the Madras School of India. The monitorial system uses slightly more-advanced students to teach less-advanced students, achieving student-teacher ratios as small as 2, while educating more than a thousand students per adult. Lancaster promoted his system in a piece called [http://www.constitution.org/lanc/improv-1803.htm Improvements in Education] that spread widely throughout the English-speaking world.\n\nDiscipline and labor in a Lancaster school were provided by an economic system. Scrip, a form of money meaningless outside the school, was created at a fixed exchange rate from a student's tuition. Every job of the school was bid-for by students in scrip, with the largest bid winning. However, ''any'' student tutor could auction positions in his or her classes. Besides tutoring, students could use scrip to buy food, school supplies, books, and childish luxuries in a school store. The adult supervisors were paid from the bids on jobs.\n\nWith fully developed internal economies, Lancaster schools provided a grammar-school education for a cost per student near $40 per year in 1999 U.S. dollars. The students were very clever at reducing their costs, and once invented, improvements were widely adopted in a school. For example, Lancaster students, motivated to save scrip, ultimately rented individual pages of textbooks from the school library, and read them in groups around music stands to reduce textbook costs. Students commonly exchanged tutoring, and paid for items and services with receipts from \"down tutoring.\"\n\nLancaster schools usually lacked sufficient adult supervision. As a result, the older children acting as disciplinary monitors tended to become brutal task masters. Also, the schools did not teach submission to orthodox Christian beliefs or government authorities. As a result, most English-speaking countries developed mandatory publicly paid education explicitly to keep public education in \"responsible\" hands. These elites said that Lancaster schools might become dishonest, provide poor education and were not accountable to established authorities.\n\nLancaster's supporters responded that any schoolchild could avoid cheats, given the opportunity, and that the government was not paying for the education, and thus deserved no say in their composition.\n\nLancaster, though motivated by charity, claimed in his pamphlets to be surprised to find that he lived well on the income of his school, even while the low costs made it available to the poorest street-children.\nIronically, Lancaster lived on the charity of friends in his later life.<ref>[http://www.k12academics.com/education-reform/educational-economies-1800s Educational Economies in the 1800s \u2013 K12 Academics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019110524/http://www.k12academics.com/education-reform/educational-economies-1800s |date=2012-10-19 }}</ref>\n\n===Progressive reforms in Europe and the United States===\nThe term ''progressive'' in education has been used somewhat indiscriminately; there are a number of kinds of [[educational progressivism]], most of the historically significant kinds peaking in the period between the late 19th and the middle of the 20th centuries.\n\n====Child-study====\n[[Image:Rousseau.jpg|right|thumb|190px|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]\n[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] has been called the father of the child-study movement. It has been said that Rousseau \"discovered\" the child (as an object of study).\n\nRousseau's principal work on education is ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]'', in which he lays out an [[educational program]] for a hypothetical newborn's education to adulthood. Rousseau provided a dual critique of both the vision of education set forth in [[Plato's Republic]] and also of the society of his contemporary Europe and the educational methods he regarded as contributing to it; he held that a person can either be a man or a [[citizen]], and that while Plato's plan could have brought the latter at the expense of the former, contemporary education failed at both tasks. He advocated a radical withdrawal of the child from society and an educational process that utilized the natural potential of the child and its curiosity, teaching it by confronting it with simulated real-life obstacles and conditioning it by experience rather than teaching it intellectually. His ideas were rarely implemented directly, but were influential on later thinkers, particularly [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] and [[Friedrich Fr\u00f6bel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fr\u00f6bel]], the inventor of the [[kindergarten]].\n\n====Horace Mann====\nIn the United States, [[Horace Mann]] (1796 \u2013 1859) of Massachusetts used his political base and role as Secretary of the [[Massachusetts State Board of Education]] to promote public education in his home state and nationwide.<ref>Jonathan Messerli, ''Horace Mann: A Biography'' (1972)</ref>  His crusading style attracted wide middle class support. Historian [[Ellwood P. Cubberley]] asserts:\n: No one did more than he to establish in the minds of the American people the conception that education should be universal, non-sectarian, free, and that its aims should be social efficiency, civic virtue, and character, rather than mere learning or the advancement of sectarian ends.<ref>Ellwood P. Cubberley, ''Public Education in the United States'' (1919)  p.  167</ref>\n\n====National identity====\nEducation is often seen in Europe and Asia as an important system to maintain national, cultural and linguistic unity. [[Prussia]] instituted primary school reforms expressly to teach a unified version of the national language, \"Hochdeutsch\". One significant reform was [[kindergarten]], whose purpose was to have the children spend time in supervised activities in the national language, when the children were young enough that they could easily learn new language skills.\n\nSince most modern schools copy the [[Prussia]]n models, children start school at an age when their language skills remain plastic, and they find it easy to learn the national language. This was an intentional design on the part of the Prussians.\n\nIn the U.S. over the last twenty years, more than 70% of non-English-speaking school-age immigrants have arrived in the U.S. before they were 6 years old. At this age, they could have been taught English in school, and achieved a proficiency indistinguishable from a [[native speaker]]. In other countries, such as the [[Soviet Union]], [[France]], [[Spain]], and [[Germany]] this approach has dramatically improved reading and math test scores for [[linguistic minorities]].\n\n====Dewey====\n[[File:Eva Watson Sch\u00fctze John Dewey.jpg|thumb|200px|John Dewey]]\n[[John Dewey]], a philosopher and educator based in Chicago and New York, helped conceptualize the role of American and international education during the first four decades of the 20th century. An important member of the American [[Pragmatism|Pragmatist]] movement, he carried the subordination of knowledge to action into the educational world by arguing for [[experiential education]] that would enable children to learn theory and practice simultaneously; a well-known example is the practice of teaching elementary physics and biology to students while preparing a meal. He was a harsh critic of \"dead\" knowledge disconnected from practical human life.<ref>Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the high tide of American liberalism'' (1997).</ref>\n\nDewey criticized the rigidity and volume of humanistic education, and the emotional idealizations of education based on the child-study movement that had been inspired by Bill Joel and those who followed him. He presented his educational theories as a synthesis of the two views. His slogan was that schools should encourage children to \"Learn by doing.\"{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} He wanted people to realize that children are naturally active and curious. Dewey's understanding of logic is best presented in his \"Logic, the Theory of Inquiry\" (1938). His educational theories were presented in \"My Pedagogic Creed\", ''The School and Society'', ''The Child and Curriculum'', and ''[[Democracy and Education]]'' (1916). [[Bertrand Russell]] criticized Dewey's conception of logic, saying \"What he calls \"logic\" does not seem to me to be part of logic at all; I should call it part of psychology.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=Professor Dewey's \"Essays in Experimental Logic\"|journal=The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods|date=January 2, 1919|volume=16|issue=1|pages=5\u201326|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0160-9335%2819190102%2916%3A1%3C5%3APD%22IEL%3E2.0.CO%3B2-Z|accessdate=March 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe question of the history of Deweyan educational practice is a difficult one. He was a widely known and influential thinker, but his views and suggestions were often misunderstood by those who sought to apply them, leading some historians to suggest that there was never an actual implementation on any considerable scale of Deweyan progressive education.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} The schools with which Dewey himself was most closely associated (though the most famous, the \"Laboratory School\", was really run by his wife) had considerable ups and downs, and Dewey left the [[University of Chicago]] in 1904 over issues relating to the Dewey School.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nDewey's influence began to decline in the time after the [[World War II|Second World War]] and particularly in the [[Cold War]] era, as more conservative educational policies came to the fore.\n\n====The administrative progressives====\n[[File:Horace Mann.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Horace Mann]], regarded as the father of American public education]]\nThe form of [[educational progressivism]] which was most successful in having its [[policies]] implemented has been dubbed \"administrative progressivism\" by historians. This began to be implemented in the early 20th century. While influenced particularly in its [[rhetoric]] by Dewey and even more by his popularizers, administrative progressivism was in its practice much more influenced by the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the concept [[economies of scale]].\n\nThe administrative progressives are responsible for many features of modern American education, especially American high schools: counseling programs, the move from many small local high schools to large centralized high schools, curricular differentiation in the form of electives and tracking, curricular, professional, and other forms of standardization, and an increase in state and federal regulation and bureaucracy, with a corresponding reduction of local control at the school board level. (Cf. \"State, federal, and local control of education in the United States\", below) (Tyack and Cuban, pp.&nbsp;17\u201326)\n\nThese reforms have since become heavily entrenched, and many today who identify themselves as progressives are opposed to many of them, while conservative education reform during the Cold War embraced them as a framework for strengthening traditional curriculum and standards.\n\nIn more recent times, groups such as the think tank [[Reform (think tank)|Reform]]'s education division, and [[S.E.R.]] have attempted to pressure the government of the [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] into more [[modernism|modernist]] educational reform, though this has met with limited success.\n\n===Late-20th and early 21st century (United states)===\n{{Split section |Education reform in the United States |discuss={{TALKPAGENAME}}#Split proposed |date=July 2016}}\n{{see also|History of education in the United States}}\n\n==== Reforms arising from the civil rights era ====\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, many of the proposed and implemented reforms in U.S. education stemmed from the [[civil rights movement]] and related trends; examples include [[desegregation|ending racial segregation]], and [[Desegregation busing in the United States|busing for the purpose of desegregation]], [[affirmative action]], and banning of [[school prayer]].<ref>Tyack and Cuban, p. 29</ref>\n\n====1980s====\nIn the 1980s, some of the momentum of education reform moved from the left to the right, with the release of ''[[A Nation at Risk]]'', [[Ronald Reagan]]'s efforts to reduce or eliminate the [[United States Department of Education]]. <blockquote> \"[T]he federal government and virtually all state governments, teacher training institutions, teachers' unions, major foundations, and the mass media have all pushed strenuously for higher standards, greater accountability, more \"time on task,\" and more impressive academic results\".<ref name=\"Miller2002\">{{cite book|author=Ron Miller|title=Free Schools, Free People: Education and Democracy After the Nineteen Sixties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VFdO7nX5NOsC|accessdate=5 June 2013|year=2002|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-8824-9|page=110}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis shift to the right caused many families to seek alternatives, including \"charter schools, progressive schools, Montessori schools, Waldorf schools, Afrocentric schools, religious schools - or teaching them at home and in their communities.\"<ref name=\"Miller2002\"/>\n\nIn the latter half of the decade, [[E.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;Hirsch]] put forth an influential attack on one or more versions of progressive education, advocating an emphasis on \"cultural literacy\"\u2014the facts, phrases, and texts that Hirsch asserted every American had once known and that now only some knew, but was still essential for decoding basic texts and maintaining communication. Hirsch's ideas remain significant through the 1990s and into the 21st century, and are incorporated into classroom practice through textbooks and curricula published under his own imprint.\n\n====1990s and 2000s====\n{{see also|Standards-based education reform}}\n\nMost states and districts in the 1990s adopted [[outcome-based education|Outcome-Based Education]] (OBE) in some form or another. A state would create a committee to adopt standards, and choose a quantitative instrument to assess whether the students knew the required content or could perform the required tasks. The standards-based National Education Goals ([[Goals 2000]]) were set by the U.S. Congress in the 1990s. Many of these goals were based on the principles of [[outcomes-based education]], and not all of the goals were attained by the year 2000 as was intended. The standards-based reform movement culminated in the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001, which {{as of|2016|lc=y}} is still an active nationwide mandate in the United States.\n\nOBE reforms usually had other disputed methods, such as [[Constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] mathematics and [[whole language]], added onto them.{{Dubious|date=October 2009}} Some proponents{{Who|date=October 2009}} advocated replacing the traditional high school diploma with a [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]]. Other reform movements were [[school-to-work transition|school-to-work]], which would require all students except those in a university track to spend substantial class time on a job site.

According to the study, if Arizona's public schools wanted to be like private schools, they would have to hire approximately 25,000 more teachers, and eliminate 21,210 administration employees.

Public [[School voucher|education vouchers]] permit guardians to select and pay any school, public or private, with public funds currently allocated to local public schools. The theory is that children's guardians will naturally shop for the best schools, much as is already done at college level.\n\nThough appealing in theory, many reforms based on school choice have led to slight to moderate improvements\u2014which some teachers' union members see as insufficient to offset the decreased teacher pay and job security.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned: How good policies produce better schools (2009)</ref> For instance, [[New Zealand]]'s landmark reform in 1989, during which schools were granted substantial autonomy, funding was devolved to schools, and parents were given a free choice of which school their children would attend, led to moderate improvements in most schools.  It was argued that the associated increases in inequity and greater racial stratification in schools nullified the educational gains. Others, however, argued that the original system created more inequity (due to lower income students being required to attend poorer performing inner city schools and not being allowed school choice or better educations that are available to higher income inhabitants of suburbs). Instead, it was argued that the school choice promoted social mobility and increased test scores especially in the cases of low income students. Similar results have been found in other jurisdictions. Though discouraging, the merely slight improvements of some school choice policies often seems to reflect weaknesses in the way that choice is implemented rather than a failure of the basic principle itself.<ref>Whelan, Lessons Learned: How good policies produce better schools (2009). Fiske, Ladd, When Schools Compete (2000)</ref>\n\n===Teacher tenure===\nCritics of teacher tenure claim that the laws protect ineffective teachers from being fired, which can be detrimental to student success.

In [[Taiwan]] in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century a movement tried to prioritize reasoning over mere facts, reduce the emphasis on central control and standardized testing.  There was consensus on the problems.  Efforts were limited because there was little consensus on the goals of educational reforms, and therefore on how to fix the problems. By 2003, the push for education reform had declined.\n\n==Motivations==\nEducation reform has been pursued for a variety of specific reasons, but generally most reforms aim at redressing some societal ills, such as [[poverty]]-, [[gender]]-, or [[Social class|class]]-based inequities, or perceived ineffectiveness. Current education trends in the United States represent multiple achievement gaps across ethnicities, income levels, and geographies.  As McKinsey and Company reported in a 2009 analysis, \u201cThese educational gaps impose on the United States the economic equivalent of a permanent national recession.\u201d<ref>McKinsey and Company, \u201cThe Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap on America\u2019s Schools.\u201d April 2009.</ref> Reforms are usually proposed by thinkers who aim to redress societal ills or institute societal changes, most often through a change in the education of the members of a class of people\u2014the preparation of a ruling class to rule or a working class to work, the social hygiene of a lower or immigrant class, the preparation of citizens in a democracy or republic, etc. The idea that all children should be provided with a high level of education is a relatively recent idea, and has arisen largely in the context of Western [[democracy]] in the 20th century.\n\nThe \"beliefs\" of school districts are optimistic that quite literally \"all students will succeed\", which in the context of [[high school graduation examination in the United States]], all students in all groups, regardless of heritage or income will pass tests that in the introduction typically fall beyond the ability of all but the top 20 to 30 percent of students. The claims clearly renounce historical research that shows that all ethnic and income groups score differently on all [[standardized test]]s and [[standards based assessment]]s and that students will achieve on a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]]. Instead, education officials across the world believe that by setting clear, achievable, higher standards, aligning the curriculum, and assessing outcomes, learning can be increased for all students, and more students can succeed than the 50 percent who are defined to be above or below grade level by norm referenced standards.\n\n[[Sovereign state|States]] have tried to use [[state school]]s to increase state power, especially to make better [[soldier]]s and workers. This strategy was first adopted to unify related linguistic groups in [[Europe]], including [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. Exact mechanisms are unclear, but it often fails in areas where populations are culturally segregated, as when the U.S. Indian school service failed to suppress [[Lakota language|Lakota]] and [[Navajo people|Navaho]], or when a culture has widely respected autonomous cultural institutions, as when the [[Spain|Spanish]] failed to suppress [[Catalonia|Catalan]].\n\nMany students of [[democracy]] have desired to improve education in order to improve the quality of governance in democratic societies; the necessity of good public education follows logically if one believes that the quality of democratic governance depends on the ability of citizens to make informed, intelligent choices, and that education can improve these abilities.\n\nPolitically motivated educational reforms of the democratic type are recorded as far back as [[Plato]] in ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]''. In the United States, this lineage of democratic education reform was continued by [[Thomas Jefferson]], who advocated ambitious reforms partly along Platonic lines for [[public education|public schooling]] in [[Virginia]].\n\nAnother motivation for reform is the desire to address socio-economic problems, which many people see as having significant roots in lack of education. Starting in the 20th century, people have attempted to argue that small improvements in education can have large returns in such areas as health, wealth and well-being. For example, in [[Kerala]], India in the 1950s, increases in women's health were correlated with increases in female literacy rates. In [[Iran]], increased primary education was correlated with increased farming efficiencies and income. In both cases some researchers have concluded these correlations as representing an underlying causal relationship: education causes socio-economic benefits. In the case of Iran, researchers concluded that the improvements were due to farmers gaining reliable access to national crop prices and scientific farming information.\n\n==Strategies==\nReforms can be based on bringing education into alignment with a society's core values.<ref name=\"School1970\">{{cite book|author=Sudbury Valley School|title=The crisis in American education: an analysis and a proposal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MAqxzEss8k4C|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=1 January 1970|publisher=The Sudbury Valley School|isbn=978-1-888947-05-2|chapter=The American Dream}}</ref><ref name=\"Gutmann1999\">{{cite book|author=Amy Gutmann|title=Democratic Education|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BZf7R6k4WHAC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=29 March 1999|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2291-1}}</ref> Reforms that attempt to change a society's core values can connect alternative education initiatives with a network of other alternative institutions.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paula Polk Lillard|title=Montessori Today: A Comprehensive Approach to Education from Birth to Adulthood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHo6zlV1j8MC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=7 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-307-76132-3|page=22}}, quoted in {{cite book|author=Mitchell Stevens|title=Kingdom of Children: Culture and Controversy in the Homeschooling Movement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lOOH21vRQRgC|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=9 February 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2480-9|page=183}}</ref>\n\n==Digital education==\n{{Main|Electronic learning}}\nThe movement to use computers more in education naturally includes many unrelated ideas, methods, and pedagogies since there are many uses for digital computers. For example, the fact that computers are naturally good at math leads to the question of the use of calculators in math education. The Internet's communication capabilities make it potentially useful for collaboration, and foreign language learning. The computer's ability to simulate physical systems makes it potentially useful in teaching science. More often, however, debate of digital education reform centers around more general applications of computers to education, such as electronic test-taking and online classes.\n\nThe idea of creating [[artificial intelligence]] led some computer scientists to believe that teachers could be replaced by computers, through something like an [[expert system]]; however, attempts to accomplish this have predictably proved inflexible. The computer is now more understood to be a tool or assistant for the teacher and students.\n\nHarnessing the richness of the Internet is another goal. In some cases classrooms have been moved entirely online, while in other instances the goal is more to learn how the Internet can be more than a classroom.\n\nWeb-based international educational software is under development by students at New York University, based on the belief that current educational institutions are too rigid: effective teaching is not routine, students are not passive, and questions of practice are not predictable or standardized. The software allows for courses tailored to an individual's abilities through frequent and automatic [[multiple intelligences]] assessments. Ultimate goals include assisting students to be intrinsically motivated to educate themselves, and aiding the student in self-actualization. Courses typically taught only in college are being reformatted so that they can be taught to any level of student, whereby elementary school students may learn the foundations of any topic they desire. Such a program has the potential to remove the bureaucratic inefficiencies of education in modern countries, and with the decreasing digital divide, help developing nations rapidly achieve a similar quality of education. With an open format similar to Wikipedia, any teacher may upload their courses online and a feedback system will help students choose relevant courses of the highest quality. Teachers can provide links in their digital courses to webcast videos of their lectures. Students will have personal academic profiles and a forum will allow students to pose complex questions, while simpler questions will be automatically answered by the software, which will bring you to a solution by searching through the knowledge database, which includes all available courses and topics.\n\nThe 21st century ushered in the acceptance and encouragement of internet research conducted on college and university campuses, in homes, and even in gathering areas of shopping centers. Addition of cyber cafes on campuses and coffee shops, loaning of communication devices from libraries, and availability of more portable technology devices, opened up a world of educational resources.  Availability of knowledge to the elite had always been obvious, yet provision of networking devices, even wireless gadget sign-outs from libraries, made availability of information an expectation of most persons. [[Cassandra B. Whyte]] researched the future of computer use on higher education campuses focusing on student affairs. Though at first seen as a data collection and outcome reporting tool, the use of computer technology in the classrooms, meeting areas, and homes continued to unfold.  The sole dependence on paper resources for subject information diminished and e-books and articles, as well as on-line courses, were anticipated to become increasingly staple and affordable choices provided by higher education institutions according to Whyte in a 2002 presentation.<ref>Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard. (1989).\"Student Affairs-The Future\". Journal of College Student Development.30. (1). 86-89.</ref><ref>Whyte, Cassandra Bolyard (2002) Presentation at a Round Table Forum on Higher Education Topics.Oxford, England.</ref>\n\n[[Flip teaching|Digitally \"flipping\" classrooms]] is a trend in digital education that has gained significant momentum. [[Will Richardson]], author and visionary for the digital education realm, points to the not-so-distant future and the seemingly infinite possibilities for digital communication linked to improved education.  Education on the whole, as a stand-alone entity, has been slow to embrace these changes. The use of web tools such as wikis, blogs, and social networking sites is tied to increasing overall effectiveness of digital education in schools.  Examples exist of teacher and student success stories where learning has transcended the classroom and has reached far out into society.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Richardson, Will. 2010. Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms 3rd ed.,155, Corwin Press</ref>\n\nCreativity is of the utmost importance when improving education.  The \"creative teachers\" must have the confidence through training and availability of support and resources.  These creative teachers are strongly encouraged to embrace a person-centered approach that develops the psychology of the educator ahead or in conjunction with the deployment of machines.<ref>Song, H.-D., Wang, W.-T., & Liu, C.-Y.

Crowd-Accelerated Innovation has pushed people to transition between media types and their understanding thereof at record-breaking paces.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Anderson, Chris. \"Crowd Accelerated Innovation.\" Wired Magazine. January 2011. Retrieved from https://www.wired.com/magazine/2010/12/ff_tedvideos/</ref> This process serves as a catalyst for creative direction and new methods of innovation.  Innovation without desire and drive inevitably flat lines.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\nMainstream media continues to be both very influential and the medium where Crowd-Accelerated Innovation gains its leverage.  Media is in direct competition with formal educational institutions in shaping the minds of today and those of tomorrow. [Buchanan, Rachel footnote] The media has been instrumental in pushing formal educational institutions to become savvier in their methods.  Additionally, advertising has been (and continues to be) a vital force in shaping students and parents thought patterns.<ref>Buchanan, Rachel.\"Paradox, Promise and Public Pedagogy: Implications of the Federal Government\u2019s Digital Education Revolution\". Vol. 36, Issue 2, Article 6, P. 73, March 2011.</ref>\n\nTechnology is a dynamic entity that is constantly in flux.  As time presses on, new technologies will continue to break paradigms that will reshape human thinking regarding technological innovation.  This concept stresses a certain disconnect between teachers and learners and the growing chasm that started some time ago.  Richardson asserts that traditional classroom's will essentially enter entropy unless teachers increase their comfort and proficiency with technology.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nAdministrators are not exempt from the technological disconnect.  They must recognize the existence of a younger generation of teachers who were born during the Digital Age and are very comfortable with technology.  However, when old meets new, especially in a mentoring situation, conflict seems inevitable.  Ironically, the answer to the outdated mentor may be digital collaboration with worldwide mentor webs; composed of individuals with creative ideas for the classroom.<ref>Gibson, S. (2009). Are our pre-service teachers prepared to teach in a digital age? In T. Bastiaens et al.(Eds.), Proceedings of World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 200(pp. 2609-2617).</ref>\n\nAnother viable addition to digital education has been blended learning.  In 2009, over 3 million K-12 students took an online course, compared to 2000 when 45,000 took an online course. Blended learning examples include pure online, blended, and traditional education.  Research results show that the most effective learning takes place in a blended format.<ref>Horn, M., Stacker, H. \"The Rise of K-12 Blended Learning\" Innosight Institute. January 2011. Retrieved from www.innosightinstitute.org</ref> This allows children to view the lecture ahead of time and then spend class time practicing, refining, and applying what they have previously learned.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal | Education | Politics }}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Anti-schooling activism]]\n* [[Blab school]]\n* [[Block scheduling]]\n* [[Certificate of Initial Mastery]]\n* [[Criterion-referenced test]]\n* [[Educational philosophies]]\n* [[High school graduation examination]]\n* [[Higher-order thinking]]\n* [[Inquiry-based Science]]\n* [[Learning environment]]\n* [[Learning space]]\n* [[Merit pay]]\n* [[Multiculturalism]]\n* [[Political correctness]]\n* [[Project-based learning]]\n* [[Special Assistance Program]]\n* [[Student-centered learning]]\n* [[Sudbury model of education|Sudbury model democratic schools]]\n* [[Sudbury Valley School]]\n* [[Teaching for social justice]]\n* [[University reform]]\n* [[Web literacy]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Free-content attribution\n| title = Education Transforms Lives\n| author = UNESCO\n| publisher = UNESCO\n| page numbers = 6, 8-9\n| source = UNESCO\n| documentURL = http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002472/247234e.pdf\n| license statement URL = http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=247234&set=00590077D4_0_95&gp=1&lin=1&ll=1\n| license = CC-BY-SA IGO 3.0\n| Editors = \n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Globalize/US|section|date=July 2016}}\n* Comer, J.P.

[[John Alden Shoudy]] came to the [[Kittitas Valley]] in 1871, and purchased a small trading post from Andrew Jackson \"A.J.\" Splawn, called \"Robber's Roost.\"   Robber's Roost was the first business in the valley, other than the early trading that occurred among Native Americans, cattle drivers, trappers, and miners. Robber's Roost was located on the present-day 3rd Avenue, just west of Main Street near the alley.  There is a placard on the wall commemorating the location, as well as a small stone monument against the wall on the sidewalk.  Shoudy named the town after his wife, Mary Ellen Shoudy, thus officially began the city of Ellensburgh around 1872. Shoudy was not the first settler in the [[Kittitas Valley]], nor was he the first businessperson, but he was responsible for platting the city of Ellensburgh in the 1870s, and he was the person who named the streets in the downtown district.\n\nThe city was originally named '''Ellensburgh''', until the final -''h'' was dropped under standardization pressure from the [[United States Postal Service]] and [[United States Board on Geographic Names|Board of Geography Names]] in 1894.<ref>Kirk (1995:123)</ref>\n\nThere were several early newspapers in Ellensburg.

Their settlements were concentrated in the \"French Prairie\" community in Northern Marion County but may have extended south to the Eugene area. Having already developed relationships with Native communities through intermarriage and trade, they negotiated for land from the Kalapuyans. By 1828 to 1830 they and their Native wives began year-round occupation of the land, raising crops and tending animals. In this process, the mixed race families began to impact Native access to land, food supply, and traditional materials for trade and religious practices.<ref>{{Cite book|title=At the Hearth of Crossed Races: A French Indian Community in Nineteenth Century Oregon, 1812-1859|last=Jette|first=Melinda Marie|publisher=Oregon State University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780870715976|location=Corvallis, Oregon|pages= 12\u201361, p. 147}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1830, \"intermittent fever\" struck the lower Columbia region and a year later, the Willamette Valley.

It fell victim to two major fires in four years, and after the second fire, the college decided not to rebuild again. The part of south Eugene known as College Hill was the former location of Columbia College. There is no college there today.\n\nThe town raised the initial funding to start a public university, which later became the University of Oregon, with the hope of turning the small town into a center of learning. In 1872, the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] passed a bill creating the University of Oregon as a state institution. Eugene bested the nearby town of [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]] in the competition for the state university. In 1873, community member J.H.D. Henderson donated the hilltop land for the campus, overlooking the city.\n\nThe university first opened in 1876 with the regents electing the first faculty and naming John Wesley Johnson as president. The first students registered on October 16, 1876. The first building was completed in 1877; it was named Deady Hall in honor of the first Board of Regents President and community leader Judge [[Matthew Deady|Matthew P. Deady]].\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\n\nEugene grew rapidly throughout most of the twentieth century, with the exception being the early 1980s when a downturn in the timber industry caused high unemployment.

All vendors must create or grow all their own products. The market reappears as the \"Holiday Market\" between Thanksgiving and New Year's in the Lane County Events Center at the fairgrounds.\n\n===Community===\nEugene is noted for its \"community inventiveness.\" Many U.S. trends in community development originated in Eugene. The University of Oregon's participatory [[planning]] process, known as [[The Oregon Experiment]], was the result of student protests in the early 1970s. The book of the same name is a major document in modern enlightenment thinking in planning and architectural circles. The process, still used by the university in modified form, was created by [[Christopher Alexander]], whose works also directly inspired the creation of the [[Wiki]]. Some research for the book ''[[A Pattern Language]]'', which inspired the [[Design Patterns]] movement and [[Extreme Programming]], was done by Alexander in Eugene. Not coincidentally, those engineering movements also had origins here. Decades after its publication, ''A Pattern Language'' is still one of the best-selling books on urban design.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=WWuTAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA232 |title= Place and Plexus: Metropolitan Land Use and Transport |last= Levinson |first= David M. |first2= Kevin J. |last2= Krizek|publisher= [[Routledge]] |year= 2008 |page= 232 |accessdate= November 10, 2014|isbn= 9781135974565 }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, Eugene was packed with cooperative and community projects. It still has small natural food stores in many neighborhoods, some of the oldest student cooperatives in the country, and alternative schools have been part of the school district since 1971. The old Grower's Market, downtown near the [[Amtrak]] depot, is the only food cooperative in the U.S. with no employees. It is possible to see Eugene's trend-setting non-profit tendencies in much newer projects, such as the Tango Center and the [[Center for Appropriate Transport]].

Several neighborhoods are known for their green activism. Friendly Neighborhood has a highly popular neighborhood garden established on the right of way of a street never built. There are a number of community gardens on public property. Amazon Neighborhood has a former church turned into a community center. Whiteaker hosts a housing co-op that dates from the early 1970s that has re-purposed both their parking lots into food production and play space. An unusual eco-village with natural building techniques and large shared garden can be found in Jefferson Westside neighborhood. A several block area in the River Road Neighborhood is known as a [[permaculture]] hotspot with an increasing number of suburban homes trading grass for garden, installing rain water catchment systems, food producing landscapes and solar retrofits. Several sites have planted gardens by removing driveways. Citizen volunteers are working with the City of Eugene to restore a 65-tree [[hazelnut|filbert]] grove on public property. There are deepening social and economic networks in the neighborhood.\n\n===Annual cultural events===\n*Asian Celebration,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.asiancelebration.org/index.html|title = Oregon Asian Celebration|date = 2014|accessdate = August 10, 2014|website = Asian Celebration|publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> presented by the Asian Council of Eugene and Springfield, takes place in February at the Lane County Fairgrounds.\n* The [[KLCC (FM)|KLCC]] Microbrew Festival<ref name=\"klcc\">{{Cite web|url = http://klcc.org/term/klcc-microbrew-festival|title = KLCC Microbrew Festival| work=[[KLCC (FM)|KLCC]]|accessdate= July 10, 2017}}</ref> is held in February at the Lane County Fairgrounds.

Eugene also has a growing [[reggae]] and street-performing [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[jug band]] scene. Multi-genre act the [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]] became a prominent figure in Eugene's music scene and became the [[house band]] at Eugene's W.O.W. Hall.

The film centered on a group of women who are trying to qualify for the Olympic track and field team. Two track and field movies about the life of [[Steve Prefontaine]], ''[[Prefontaine (film)|Prefontaine]]'' and ''[[Without Limits]]'' were released within a year of each other in 1997\u20131998. [[Kenny Moore]], Eugene-trained Olympic runner and co-star in ''Prefontaine'', co-wrote the screenplay for ''Without Limits''. ''Prefontaine'' was filmed in Washington because the ''Without Limits'' production bought out [[Hayward Field]] for the summer to prevent its competition from shooting there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eugenecascadescoast.org/running/history/pre-legends/|title=Steve Prefontaine and Running Legends|publisher=Eugene Cascades & Coast|accessdate=March 11, 2013}}</ref> Kenny Moore also wrote a biography of [[Bill Bowerman]], played in ''Without Limits'' by [[Donald Sutherland]] back in Eugene 20 years after he had appeared in ''Animal House''. Moore had also had a role in ''Personal Best''.\n\n''[[Stealing Time]]'', a 2003 independent film, was partially filmed in Eugene. When the film premiered in June 2001 at the [[Seattle International Film Festival]], it was titled ''Rennie's Landing'' after a popular bar near the University of Oregon campus.

Jogging was introduced to the U.S. through Eugene, brought from [[New Zealand]] by Bill Bowerman, who wrote the best-selling book \"Jogging\", and coached the champion University of Oregon track and cross country teams. During Bowerman's tenure, his \"Men of Oregon\" won 24 individual [[NCAA]] titles, including titles in 15 out of the 19 events contested. During Bowerman's 24 years at Oregon, his track teams finished in the top ten at the NCAA championships 16 times, including four team titles (1962, '64, '65, '70), and two second-place trophies. His teams also posted a dual meet record of 114\u201320.\n\nBowerman also invented the waffle sole for running shoes in Eugene, and with Oregon alumnus [[Phil Knight]] founded shoe giant Nike. Eugene's miles of running trails, through its unusually large park system, are the most extensive in the U.S. The city has dozens of running clubs. The climate is cool and temperate, good both for jogging and record-setting. Eugene is home to the University of Oregon's Hayward Field track, which hosts numerous collegiate and amateur track and field meets throughout the year, most notably the [[Prefontaine Classic]].

Her mother's collection of her poems forms one of the largest [[extant literature|extant]] collections of [[juvenilia]] by any English writer. At 15 she became ill, suffering intense head and spinal pain for the rest of her life. Later in life she also developed lung problems, possibly [[tuberculosis]]. She took [[laudanum]] for the pain from an early age, which is likely to have contributed to her frail health.\n\nIn the 1830s Elizabeth was introduced to literary society through her cousin, [[John Kenyon (patron)|John Kenyon]]. Her first adult collection of poems was published in 1838 and she wrote prolifically between 1841 and 1844, producing poetry, translation and prose. She campaigned for [[Abolitionism in the United States|the abolition of slavery]] and her work helped influence reform in the [[Factories Act 1847|child labour legislation]]. Her prolific output made her a rival to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] as a candidate for [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|poet laureate]] on the death of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]].\n\nElizabeth's volume ''Poems'' (1844) brought her great success, attracting the admiration of the writer [[Robert Browning]]. Their correspondence, courtship and marriage were carried out in secret, for fear of her father's disapproval. Following the wedding she was indeed disinherited by her father. The couple moved to Italy in 1846, where she would live for the rest of her life. They had one son, [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning]], whom they called Pen. She died in [[Florence]] in 1861.<ref>[http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/152 Poets.org]</ref><ref name=\"ONDB\"/> A collection of her last poems was published by her husband shortly after her death.\n\nElizabeth's work had a major influence on prominent writers of the day, including the American poets [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[Emily Dickinson]]. She is remembered for such poems as \"[[Sonnets from the Portuguese#Number 43|How Do I Love Thee?]]\" (Sonnet 43, 1845) and ''[[Aurora Leigh]] ''(1856).\n\n==Life and career==\n===Family background===\n<!-- PLEASE NOTE: The repetition of \"Barrett\" is *not* an error -->\nSome of Elizabeth Barrett's family had lived in [[Jamaica]] since 1655. Their wealth derived mainly from Edward Barrett (1734\u20131798), owner of {{convert|10000|acre|ha}} in the estates of [[Saint James Parish, Jamaica|Cinnamon Hill]], [[Cornwall County, Jamaica|Cornwall]], [[Cambridge, Jamaica|Cambridge]] and Oxford in northern Jamaica. Elizabeth's maternal grandfather owned [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|sugar plantations]], [[sugar cane mill|mills]], glassworks and ships that traded between Jamaica and [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. Biographer Julia Markus states the poet \"believed that she had African blood through her grandfather Charles Moulton\", but<ref>{{cite book|author=Johnson Publishing Company|title=Ebony|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JnOSQ7xrcA8C&pg=PA97|date=May 1995|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|page=97}}</ref> there is no evidence of this \u2013 although other branches of her family had African blood through relationships between plantation owners and slaves. What the family believed to be their genealogy in relation to Jamaica is unclear.<ref name=\"ONDB\">Marjorie Stone, \"Browning, Elizabeth Barrett (1806\u20131861)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edition, October 2008.</ref>\n\nThe family wished to hand down their name, stipulating that Barrett should always be held as a surname. In some cases inheritance was given on condition that the name was used by the beneficiary; the English gentry and \"squirearchy\" had long encouraged [[Name change#Historical usage|this sort of name changing]]. Given this strong tradition, Elizabeth used \"Elizabeth Barrett Moulton Barrett\" on legal documents and before she was married often signed herself \"Elizabeth Barrett Barrett\" or \"EBB\" (initials which she was able to keep after her wedding).<ref name=\"ONDB\"/>\n\nElizabeth's father chose to raise his family in England while his business enterprises remained in Jamaica. The fortune of Elizabeth's mother's line, the Graham Clarke family, also derived in part from slave labour, and was considerable.\n\n===Early life===\nElizabeth Barrett Moulton-Barrett was born on 6 March 1806, in Coxhoe Hall, between the villages of [[Coxhoe]] and [[Kelloe]] in County Durham, England. Her parents were Edward Barrett Moulton Barrett and Mary Graham Clarke; Elizabeth was the eldest of 12 children (eight boys and four girls). All lived to adulthood except for one girl, who died at the age of three, when Elizabeth was eight.\n\nThe children all had nicknames: Elizabeth was \"Ba\". She rode her pony, went for family walks and picnics, socialised with other county families, and participated in home theatrical productions. But unlike her siblings, she immersed herself in books as often as she could get away from the social rituals of her family.\n\nShe was baptized in 1809 at Kelloe parish church, although she had<ref>Taplin, Gardner B. \"Elizabeth Barrett Browning.\" Victorian Poets Before 1850.

Web. 7 December 2014.</ref> During the Hope End period, she was an intensely studious, precocious child.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Taplin, Gardner B. ''The Life of Elizabeth Browning'' New Haven: Yale University Press (1957).</ref> She claimed that at the age of six she was reading novels, at eight entranced by [[Alexander Pope|Pope]]'s translations of [[Homer]], studying Greek at ten, and at twelve writing her own [[Homeric epic]], ''[[The Battle of Marathon: A Poem]]''.\n\nIn 1820 Mr Barrett privately published ''The Battle of Marathon'', an epic-style poem, though all copies remained within the family.<ref name=\"Browning, Elizabeth Barrett 2005\"/> Her mother compiled the child's poetry into collections of \"Poems by Elizabeth B. Barrett\". Her father called her the \"[[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] of Hope End\" and encouraged her work. The result is one of the largest collections of juvenilia of any English writer. [[Mary Russell Mitford]] described the young Elizabeth at this time, as having \"a slight, delicate figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on each side of a most expressive face; large, tender eyes, richly fringed by dark eyelashes, and a smile like a sunbeam.\"\n\nAt about this time, Elizabeth began to battle with illness, which the medical science of the time was unable to diagnose.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> All three sisters came down with the syndrome although it lasted only with Elizabeth. She had intense head and spinal pain with loss of mobility. Various biographies link this to a riding accident at the time (she fell while trying to dismount a horse), but there is no evidence to support the link.  Sent to recover at the Gloucester spa, she was treated \u2013 in the absence of symptoms supporting another diagnosis \u2013 for a spinal problem.<ref name=\"Taylor, Beverly 1999\"/> Though this illness continued for the rest of her life, it is believed to be unrelated to the lung disease which she developed in 1837.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/>\n\nShe began to take opiates for the pain, [[laudanum]] (an [[opium]] concoction) followed by morphine, then commonly prescribed. She would become dependent on them for much of her adulthood; the use from an early age may well have contributed to her frail health. Biographers such as Alethea Hayter have suggested this may also have contributed to the wild vividness of her imagination and the poetry that it produced.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/><ref>Hayter, Alethea (1962). ''Mrs. Browning: a poet's work and its setting''. Faber and Faber, pp. 61\u201366.</ref>\n\nBy 1821 she had read [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), and become a passionate supporter of Wollstonecraft's ideas.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> The child's intellectual fascination with the classics and metaphysics was reflected in a religious intensity which she later described as \"not the deep persuasion of the mild Christian but the wild visions of an enthusiast.\"<ref>Everett, Glenn (2002). ''Life of Elizabeth Browning''.</ref> The Barretts attended services at the nearest [[Dissenter|Dissenting]] chapel, and Edward was active in Bible and [[Missionary#The British missionary societies|Missionary societies]].\n\n[[File:Panasonic GM5 black 8GB 13 1040230.JPG|thumb|upright|Blue plaque outside \"Belle Vue\" in [[Sidmouth]], Devon, where Elizabeth Barrett lived with her family from 1833 to 1835]]\n\nElizabeth's mother died in 1828, and is buried at St Michael's Church, Ledbury, next to her daughter Mary. Sarah Graham-Clarke, Elizabeth's aunt, helped to care for the children, and she had clashes with Elizabeth's strong will. In 1831 Elizabeth's grandmother, Elizabeth Moulton, died. Following lawsuits and the abolition of slavery Mr Barrett incurred great financial and investment losses that forced him to sell Hope End. Although the family was never poor, the place was seized and put up for sale to satisfy creditors. Always secret in his financial dealings, he would not discuss his situation and the family was haunted by the idea that they might have to move to Jamaica.\n\nBetween 1833 and 1835, she was living, with her family, at Belle Vue in Sidmouth. The site has now been renamed Cedar Shade and redeveloped. A blue plaque at the entrance to the site attests to this. In 1838, some years after the sale of Hope End, the family settled at 50 [[Wimpole Street]].<ref name=\"ONDB\"/>\n\nDuring 1837\u201338 the poet was struck with illness again, with symptoms today suggesting [[Tuberculosis|tuberculous]] ulceration of the lungs. That same year, at her physician's insistence, she moved from London to [[Torquay]], on the Devonshire coast.  Two tragedies then struck. In February 1840 her brother Samuel died of a fever in Jamaica.  Then her favourite brother Edward (\"Bro\") was drowned in a sailing accident in Torquay in July. This had a serious effect on her already fragile health. She felt guilty as her father had disapproved of Edward's trip to Torquay. She wrote to Mitford, \"That was a very near escape from madness, absolute hopeless madness\".<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> The family returned to Wimpole Street in 1841.\n\n===Success===\n[[File:Brocky, Karoly - Portrait of Elisabeth Barrett-Browning (1839-44).jpg|thumb|220px|right|Portrait of Barrett Browning by [[K\u00e1roly Brocky]], ca.&nbsp;1839\u20131844]]\nAt Wimpole Street Barrett Browning spent most of her time in her upstairs room. Her health began to improve, though she saw few people other than her immediate family.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> One of those was Kenyon, a wealthy friend of the family and patron of the arts.

The poem \"[[The Cry of the Children (poem)|The Cry of the Children]]\", published in 1842 in ''[[Blackwoods Magazine|Blackwoods]]'', condemned child labour and helped bring about child-labour reforms by raising support for Lord Shaftesbury's [[Factories Act 1847|Ten Hours Bill]] (1844).<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> At about the same time, she contributed critical prose pieces to Richard Henry Horne's ''A New Spirit of the Age''.\n\nIn 1844 she published two volumes of ''Poems'', which included \"A Drama of Exile\", \"A Vision of Poets\", and \"Lady Geraldine's Courtship\" and two substantial critical essays for 1842 issues of ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]''. \"Since she was not burdened with any domestic duties expected of her sisters, Barrett Browning could now devote herself entirely to the life of the mind, cultivating an enormous correspondence, reading widely\".<ref name=\"Pollock, Mary Sanders 2003\">{{cite book|author=Mary Sanders Pollock|title=Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning: a creative partnership|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IfuY5sdwphYC|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-3328-0}}</ref> Her prolific output made her a rival to [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]] as a candidate for poet laureate in 1850 on the death of [[William Wordsworth|Wordsworth]].<ref name=\"ONDB\"/>\n\nA [[Royal Society of Arts]] [[blue plaque]] now commemorates Elizabeth at 50 Wimpole Street.<ref name=\"EngHet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/discover/blue-plaques/search/barrett-elizabeth-barrett-1806-1861-a.k.a.-elizabeth-barrett-browning|title=BARRETT, ELIZABETH BARRETT (1806\u20131861)|publisher=English Heritage|accessdate=23 October 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Robert Browning and Italy===\n[[File:Elizabeth Barrett Browning with her son Pen.jpg|thumb|right|Elizabeth Barrett Browning with her son Pen, 1860]]\n[[File:Clasped Hands of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning MET DT8282.jpg|thumb|''[[Clasped Hands of Robert and Elizabeth Barrett Browning]]'', 1853 by [[Harriet Hosmer]].]]\nHer 1844 volume ''Poems'' made her one of the most popular writers in the country, and inspired [[Robert Browning]] to write to her.  He wrote, \"I love your verses with all my heart, dear Miss Barrett,\" praising their \"fresh strange music, the affluent language, the exquisite pathos and true new brave thought.\"<ref name=\"ONDB\"/>\n\nKenyon arranged for Browning to meet Elizabeth on 20 May 1845, in her rooms, and so began one of the most famous courtships in literature. Elizabeth had already produced a large amount of work, but Browning had a great influence on her subsequent writing, as did she on his: two of Barrett's most famous pieces were written after she met Browning, ''[[Sonnets from the Portuguese]]''<ref name=\"Burr\">{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|title=Sonnets from the Portuguese: A Celebration 0f Love|date=15 August 1986|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-74501-1}}</ref> and ''Aurora Leigh.'' Robert's ''[[Men and Women (poetry collection)|Men and Women]]'' is also a product of that time.\n\nSome critics state that her activity was, in some ways, in decay before she met Browning: \"Until her relationship with [[Robert Browning]] began in 1845, Barrett's willingness to engage in public discourse about social issues and about aesthetic issues in poetry, which had been so strong in her youth, gradually diminished, as did her physical health. As an intellectual presence and a physical being, she was becoming a shadow of herself.\"<ref name=\"Pollock, Mary Sanders 2003\"/>\n\n[[File:Lettre de Robert Browning \u00e0 Elizabeth Barrett Browning dat\u00e9e en 1846.jpg|left|thumb|Letter from [[Robert Browning]] to Elizabeth Barrett, 10 September 1846]]\n\nThe courtship and marriage between Robert Browning and Elizabeth were carried out secretly, as she knew her father would disapprove. After a private marriage at [[St Marylebone Parish Church]], they honeymooned in Paris before moving to Italy, in September 1846, which became their home almost continuously until her death. Elizabeth's loyal nurse, Wilson, who witnessed the marriage, accompanied the couple to Italy.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/>\n\nMr Barrett disinherited Elizabeth, as he did each of his children who married. Elizabeth had foreseen her father's anger but had not anticipated her brothers' rejection.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> As Elizabeth had some money of her own, the couple were reasonably comfortable in Italy. The Brownings were well respected, and even famous. Elizabeth grew stronger and in 1849, at the age of 43, between four miscarriages, she gave birth to a son, [[Robert Barrett Browning|Robert Wiedeman Barrett Browning]], whom they called Pen. Their son later married, but had no legitimate children.\n\nAt her husband's insistence, Elizabeth's second edition of ''Poems'' included her love sonnets; as a result, her popularity increased (as well as critical regard), and her artistic position was confirmed.\n\nThe couple came to know a wide circle of artists and writers including [[William Makepeace Thackeray]], sculptor [[Harriet Hosmer]] (who, she wrote, seemed to be the \"perfectly emancipated female\") and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. In 1849 she met [[Margaret Fuller]], and the female French novelist [[George Sand]] in 1852, whom she had long admired. Among her intimate friends in Florence was the writer [[Isa Blagden]], whom she encouraged to write novels.<ref>\"Isa Blagden\", in: ''The Brownings' Correspondence''.

B. Hunter, and then of her father, Barrett Browning's health started to deteriorate. The Brownings moved from [[Florence]] to [[Siena]], residing at the ''Villa Alberti''. Engrossed in Italian politics, she issued a small volume of political poems titled ''Poems before Congress'' (1860) \"most of which were written to express her sympathy with the Italian cause after the outbreak of fighting in 1859\".<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/> They caused a furore in England, and the conservative magazines ''[[Blackwood's Magazine|Blackwood's]]'' and the ''[[Saturday Review (London)|Saturday Review]]'' labelled her a fanatic. She dedicated this book to her husband. Her last work was ''A Musical Instrument'', published posthumously.\n\nBarrett Browning's sister Henrietta died in November 1860. The couple spent the winter of 1860\u201361 in Rome where Barrett Browning's health further deteriorated and they returned to Florence in early June 1861.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> She became gradually weaker, using morphine to ease her pain.

Later, at Boyd's suggestion, she translated [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (published in 1833; retranslated in 1850). During their friendship Barrett studied Greek literature, including [[Homer]], [[Pindar]] and [[Aristophanes]].\n\nElizabeth opposed slavery and published two poems highlighting the barbarity of slavers and her support for the abolitionist cause: \"The Runaway Slave at Pilgrim's Point\"; and \"A Curse for a Nation\". In \"Runaway\" she describes a slave woman who is whipped, raped, and made pregnant as she curses the slavers.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/> Elizabeth declared herself glad that the slaves were \"virtually free\" when the [[Emancipation Act]] abolishing slavery in British colonies was passed in 1833, despite the fact that her father believed that [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionism]] would ruin his business.\n\nThe date of publication of these poems is in dispute, but her position on slavery in the poems is clear and may have led to a rift between Elizabeth and her father. She wrote to [[John Ruskin]] in 1855 \"I belong to a family of West Indian slaveholders, and if I believed in curses, I should be afraid\". After the [[Baptist War|Jamaican slave uprising]] of 1831\u201332, her father and uncle continued to treat the slaves humanely.\n\nIn London, John Kenyon, a distant cousin, introduced Elizabeth to literary figures including [[William Wordsworth]], [[Mary Russell Mitford]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. Elizabeth continued to write, contributing \"The Romaunt of Margaret\", \"The Romaunt of the Page\", \"The Poet's Vow\" and other pieces to various periodicals. She corresponded with other writers, including [[Mary Russell Mitford]], who would become a close friend and who would support Elizabeth's literary ambitions.<ref name=\"ONDB\"/>\n\nIn 1838 ''The Seraphim and Other Poems'' appeared, the first volume of Elizabeth's mature poetry to appear under her own name.\n\n''[[Sonnets from the Portuguese]]'' was published in 1850. There is debate about the origin of the title. Some say it refers to the series of sonnets of the 16th-century Portuguese poet [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]]. However, \"my little Portuguese\" was a pet name that Browning had adopted for Elizabeth and this may have some connection.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wall|first1=Jennifer Kingma|title=Love and Marriage: How Biographical Interpretation affected the Reception of Elizabeth Barrett Browning's \"Sonnets from the Portuguese\" (1850)|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ebb/wall1.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=2 January 2015|quote=\"the title was actually a reference to a term of endearment Robert had for Elizabeth, my little Portuguese, a reference to her dark complexion\"}}</ref>\n\nThe verse-novel ''Aurora Leigh,'' her most ambitious and perhaps the most popular of her longer poems, appeared in 1856. It is the story of a female writer making her way in life, balancing work and love, and based on Elizabeth's own experiences. ''Aurora Leigh'' was an important influence on [[Susan B. Anthony]]'s thinking about the traditional roles of women, with regard to marriage versus independent individuality.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alma Lutz| title=Susan B. Anthony Rebel, Crusader, Humanitarian|year=1959|publisher=Boston, Beacon Press}}</ref> The ''[[North American Review]]'' praised Elizabeth's poem: \"Mrs. Browning's poems are, in all respects, the utterance of a woman \u2014 of a woman of great learning, rich experience, and powerful genius, uniting to her woman's nature the strength which is sometimes thought peculiar to a man.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|title=Aurora Leigh, and other poems|year=2001|publisher=Women's Press|isbn=978-0-7043-3820-3}}</ref>\n\n==Spiritual influence==\nMuch of Barrett Browning's work carries a religious theme. She had read and studied such works as [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' and [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. She says in her writing, \"We want the sense of the saturation of Christ's blood upon the souls of our poets, that it may cry through them in answer to the ceaseless wail of the [[Sphinx]] of our humanity, expounding agony into renovation. Something of this has been perceived in art when its glory was at the fullest. Something of a yearning after this may be seen among the Greek Christian poets, something which would have been much with a stronger faculty\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ebb/cornhill.html|title=Biog|publisher=Victorianweb.org|date=18 July 2005|accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref> She believed that \"Christ's religion is essentially poetry \u2013 poetry glorified\". She explored the religious aspect in many of her poems, especially in her early work, such as the sonnets.\n\nShe was interested in theological debate, had learned Hebrew and read the Hebrew Bible.<ref>{{cite book|author=Linda M.

Her popularity in the United States and Britain was further advanced by her stands against social injustice, including slavery in the United States, injustice toward Italian citizens by foreign rulers, and child labour.\n\n[[Lilian Whiting]] published a biography of Barrett Browning (1899) which describes her as \"the most philosophical poet\" and depicts her life as \"a Gospel of applied Christianity\". To Whiting, the term \"art for art's sake\" did not apply to Barrett Browning's work, as each poem, distinctively purposeful, was borne of a more \"honest vision\". In this critical analysis, Whiting portrays Barrett Browning as a poet who uses knowledge of Classical literature with an \"intuitive gift of spiritual divination\".<ref name=\"Whiting\">Whiting, Lilian. ''A study of Elizabeth Barrett Browning''. Little, Brown and Company (1899)</ref> In ''Elizabeth Barrett Browning'', Angela Leighton suggests that the portrayal of Barrett Browning as the \"pious iconography of womanhood\" has distracted us from her poetic achievements. Leighton cites the 1931 play by [[Rudolf Besier]], ''[[The Barretts of Wimpole Street]]'', as evidence that 20th-century literary criticism of Barrett Browning's work has suffered more as a result of her popularity than poetic ineptitude.<ref name=\"Leighton\">{{cite book|author=Angela Leighton|title=Elizabeth Barrett Browning|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wHp90dJD7fkC&pg=PA8|accessdate=22 October 2011|year=1986|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-25451-1|pages=8\u201318}}</ref> The play was popularized by actress [[Katharine Cornell]], for whom it became a signature role. It was an enormous success, both artistically and commercially, and was revived several times and adapted twice into movies.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, literary criticism of Barrett Browning's poetry remained sparse until her poems were discovered by the women's movement. She once described herself as being inclined to reject several women's rights principles, suggesting in letters to [[Mary Russell Mitford]] and her husband that she believed that there was an inferiority of intellect in women. In ''Aurora Leigh'', however, she created a strong and independent woman who embraces both work and love. Leighton writes that because Elizabeth participates in the literary world, where voice and diction are dominated by perceived masculine superiority, she \"is defined only in mysterious opposition to everything that distinguishes the male subject who writes...\"<ref name=Leighton/> A five-volume scholarly edition of her works was published in 2010, the first in over a century.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\n==Works (collections)==\n{{Library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooks=yes|viaf=66464493}}\n*1820: ''[[The Battle of Marathon: A Poem]]''.

Enlil's primary center of worship was the [[Ekur]] temple in the city of [[Nippur]], which was believed to have been built by Enlil himself and was regarded as the \"mooring-rope\" of heaven and earth. He is also sometimes referred to in Sumerian texts as '''Nunamnir'''. According to one Sumerian hymn, Enlil himself was so holy that not even the other gods could look upon him. Enlil rose to prominence during the twenty-fourth century BC with the rise of Nippur. His [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] fell into decline after Nippur was sacked by the [[Elam]]ites in 1230 BC and he was eventually supplanted as the chief god of the Mesopotamian pantheon by the Babylonian [[national god]] [[Marduk]]. The Babylonian god '''[[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]''' was a [[Syncretism|syncretic deity]] of Enlil, Marduk, and the [[Death or departure of the gods|dying god]] [[Dumuzid]].\n\nEnlil plays a vital role in the [[Sumerian creation myth]]; he separates [[Anu|An]] (heaven) from [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]] (earth), thus making the world habitable for humans. In the Sumerian [[Flood myth]], Enlil rewards [[Ziusudra]] with immortality for having survived the flood and, in the Babylonian flood myth, Enlil is the cause of the flood himself, having sent the flood to exterminate the human race, who made too much noise and prevented him from sleeping. The myth of ''[[Enlil and Ninlil]]'' is about Enlil's serial seduction of the goddess [[Ninlil]] in various guises, resulting in the conception of the moon-god [[Sin (god)|Nanna]] and the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]] deities [[Nergal]], [[Ninazu]], and [[Enbilulu]]. Enlil was regarded as the inventor of the [[mattock]] and the patron of agriculture. Enlil also features prominently in several myths involving his son [[Ninurta]], including ''[[Anz\u00fb]] and the [[Tablet of Destinies (mythic item)|Tablet of Destinies]]'' and ''Lugale''.\n\n==Etymology==\nEnlil's name comes from ancient Sumerian [[EN (cuneiform)|EN]], meaning \"lord\" and L\u00cdL meaning \"wind\".{{sfn|Halloran|2006}}{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=114}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} His name therefore literally translates as \"Lord Wind\".{{sfn|Halloran|2006}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=182}} Enlil's name is not a genitive construction,{{snf|van der Toorn|Becking|Willem|1999|page=356}} indicating that Enlil was seen as the personification of the wind itself rather than merely the cause of wind.{{snf|van der Toorn|Becking|Willem|1999|page=356}}\n\n==Worship==\n[[File:Ruins from a temple in Naffur.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Modern photograph of the ruins of the [[Ekur]] temple at Nippur]]\n[[File:Ekur plan.svg|thumb|Floor plan of the Ekur temple in Nippur]]\n{{rquote|right|Enlil who sits broadly on the white dais, on the lofty dais, who perfects the decrees of power, lordship, and princeship, the earth-gods bow down in fear before him, the heaven-gods humble themselves before him...|Sumerian hymn to Enlil, translated by [[Samuel Noah Kramer]]{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=120}}}}\n[[File:Cuneiform inscription on a diorite mortar stating that this was an offering from Gudea to Enlil.

the patron god of the Sumerian city-state of [[Nippur]]{{snf|Hallo|1996|pages=231\u2013234}} and his main center of worship was the [[Ekur]] temple located there.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|pages=74 and 76}} The name of the temple literally means \"Mountain House\" in ancient Sumerian.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=74}} The Ekur was believed to have been built and established by Enlil himself.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=74}} It was believed to be the \"mooring-rope\" of heaven and earth,{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=74}} meaning that it was seen as \"a channel of communication between earth and heaven\".{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=53}} A hymn written during the reign of [[Ur-Nammu]], the founder of the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]], describes the E-kur in great detail, stating that its gates were carved with scenes of [[Imdugud]], a lesser deity sometimes shown as a giant bird, slaying a lion and an eagle snatching up a sinner.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=74}}\n\nThe Sumerians believed that the sole purpose of humanity's existence was to serve the gods.{{sfn|Janzen|2004|page=247}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=123}} They thought that a god's statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}} As such, [[Cult image|cult statues]] were given constant care and attention{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013187}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013188}} People worshipped Enlil by offering food and other human necessities to him.{{sfn|Janzen|2004|page=247}} The food, which was ritually laid out before the god's cult statue in the form of a feast,{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013187}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} was believed to be Enlil's daily meal,{{sfn|Janzen|2004|page=247}} but, after the ritual, it would be distributed among his priests.{{sfn|Janzen|2004|page=247}} These priests were also responsible for changing the cult statue's clothing.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}}\n\nThe Sumerians envisioned Enlil as a benevolent, fatherly deity, who watches over humanity and cares for their well-being.{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=119}} One Sumerian hymn describes Enlil as so glorious that even the other gods could not look upon him.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=76}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=121}} The same hymn also states that, without Enlil, civilization could not exist.{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=121}} Enlil's [[epithet]]s include titles such as \"the Great Mountain\" and \"King of the Foreign Lands\".{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=76}} Enlil is also sometimes described as a \"raging storm\", a \"wild bull\", and a \"merchant\".{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=76}} The Mesopotamians envisioned him as a creator, a father, a king, and the supreme lord of the universe.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=76}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=119\u2013121}} He was also known as \"Nunamnir\"{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=76}} and is referred to in at least one text as the \"East Wind and North Wind\".{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=76}}\n\nKings regarded Enlil as a model ruler and sought to emulate his example.{{snf|Grottanelli|Mander|2005|page=5,162a}} Enlil was said to be supremely just{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=120}} and intolerant towards evil.{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=120}} Rulers from all over Sumer would travel to Enlil's temple in Nippur to be legitimized.{{snf|Littleton|2005|pages=480\u2013482}} They would return Enlil's favor by devoting lands and precious objects to his temple as offerings.{{snf|Littleton|2005|page=482}} Nippur was the only Sumerian city-state that never built a palace;{{sfn|Janzen|2004|page=247}} this was intended to symbolize the city's importance as the center of the cult of Enlil by showing that Enlil himself was the city's king.{{sfn|Janzen|2004|page=247}} Even during the Babylonian Period, when [[Marduk]] had superseded Enlil as the supreme god, Babylonian kings still traveled to the holy city of Nippur to seek recognition of their right to rule.{{snf|Littleton|2005|page=482}}\n\nEnlil first rose to prominence during the twenty-fourth century BC, when the importance of the god [[Anu|An]] began to wane.{{snf|Schneider|2011|page=58}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=118}} During this time period, Enlil and An are frequently invoked together in inscriptions.{{snf|Schneider|2011|page=58}} Enlil remained the supreme god in Mesopotamia throughout the Amorite Period,{{snf|Schneider|2011|pages=58\u201359}} with Amorite monarchs proclaiming Enlil as the source of their legitimacy.{{snf|Schneider|2011|pages=58\u201359}} Enlil's importance began to wane after the Babylonian king [[Hammurabi]] conquered Sumer.{{snf|Schneider|2011|page=59}} The Babylonians worshipped Enlil under the name \"Elil\"{{snf|Coleman|Davidson|2015|page=108}} and the Hurrians syncretized him with their own god [[Kumarbi]].{{snf|Coleman|Davidson|2015|page=108}} In one Hurrian ritual, Enlil and Apantu are invoked as \"the father and mother of [[Ishara|I\u0161\u1e2bara]]\".{{sfn|Archi|1990|page=114}} Enlil is also invoked alongside Ninlil as a member of \"the [[Anunnaki#Hurrian and Hittite|mighty and firmly established gods]]\".{{sfn|Archi|1990|page=114}}\n\nDuring the Kassite Period ({{circa}} 1592 BC \u2013 1155 BC), Nippur briefly managed to regain influence in the region and Enlil rose to prominence once again.{{snf|Schneider|2011|page=59}} From around 1300 BC onwards, Enlil was syncretized with the Assyrian national god [[Ashur (god)|A\u0161\u0161ur]],{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=38}} who was the most important deity in the Assyrian pantheon.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=37}} Then, in 1230 BC, the [[Elamites]] attacked Nippur and the city fell into decline, taking the cult of Enlil along with it.{{snf|Schneider|2011|page=59}} Approximately one hundred years later, Enlil's role as the head of the pantheon was given to [[Marduk]], the [[national god]] of the Babylonians.{{snf|Schneider|2011|page=59}}{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Enlil's importance in the pantheon significantly declined{{sfn|Mark|2017}} and he was sometimes assimilated as merely an aspect of Marduk.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Nonetheless, his temples continued functioning throughout the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian period]] (911 BC \u2014 609 BC){{sfn|Mark|2017}} and even the Babylonians saw Anu and Enlil as the ones who bestowed Marduk with his powers.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} During the first millennium BC, the Babylonians worshipped a deity under the title \"[[Bel (mythology)|Bel]]\", meaning \"lord\", who was a syncretization of Enlil, Marduk, and the [[Death or departure of the gods|dying god]] [[Dumuzid]].{{sfn|Fontenrose|1980|page=440}}{{sfn|Doniger|1990|page=120}} Bel held all the cultic titles of Enlil{{sfn|Doniger|1990|page=120}} and his status in the Babylonian religion was largely the same.{{sfn|Doniger|1990|page=120}} Eventually, Bel came to be seen as the god of order and destiny.{{sfn|Doniger|1990|page=120}} Meanwhile, A\u0161\u0161ur continued to be known as \"the Assyrian Enlil\" or \"the Enlil of the gods\".{{sfn|Mark|2017}} After the collapse of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, Enlil's statues were smashed and his temples were destroyed because he had become inextricably associated with the Assyrians, who many conquered peoples hated.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Enlil continued to be venerated under the name of Marduk until around 141 BC, when the cult of Marduk fell into terminal decline, and was eventually forgotten entirely.{{sfn|Mark|2017}}\n\n==Iconography==\nEnlil was not represented anthropomorphically in Mesopotamian iconography.{{sfn|Moore|1977|page=76}} Instead, he was represented by a horned cap,{{sfn|Moore|1977|page=76}} which consisted of up to seven superimposed pairs of ox-horns.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=102}} Such crowns were an important symbol of divinity;{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=98}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=185}} gods had been shown wearing them ever since the third millennium BC.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}} The horned cap remained consistent in form and meaning from the earliest days of Sumerian prehistory up until the time of the Persian conquest and beyond.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}}\n\nThe Sumerians had a complex numerological system, in which certain numbers were believed to hold special ritual significance.{{sfn|McEvilley|2002|pages=171\u2013172}} Within this system, Enlil was associated with the number fifty, which was considered sacred to him.{{snf|R\u00f6llig|1971|pages=499\u2013500}} Enlil was part of a triad of deities, which also included An and Enki.{{sfn|Tsumura|2005|page=134}}{{sfn|Delaporte|1996|page=137}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=118\u2013122}} These three deities together were the embodiment of all the [[fixed stars]] in the night sky.{{sfn|Rogers|1998|page=13}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} An was identified with all the stars of the [[Celestial equator|equatorial sky]], Enlil with those of the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|northern sky]], and Enki with those of the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern sky]].{{sfn|Rogers|1998|page=13}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} The path of Enlil's celestial orbit was a continuous, symmetrical circle around the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]],{{sfn|Levenda|2008|page=29}} but those of An and Enki were believed to intersect at various points.{{sfn|Levenda|2008|pages=29\u201330}} Enlil was associated with the constellation [[Bo\u00f6tes]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=76}}\n\n==Mythology==\n===Origins

[[Nammu]], the primeval sea.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pp=37\u201340}} Then, Nammu gave birth to [[Anu|An]], the sky, and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], the earth.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=37\u201340}} An and Ki mated with each other, causing Ki to give birth to Enlil.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=37\u201340}} Enlil separated An from Ki and carried off the earth as his domain, while An carried off the sky.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=37\u201341}}\n\n''[[Enlil and Ninlil]]'' (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr121.htm 1.2.1]) is a nearly complete 152-line Sumerian poem describing the affair between Enlil and the goddess [[Ninlil]].{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=43}}{{snf|Jacobsen|1946|pages=128\u2013152}} First, Ninlil's mother Nunbarshegunu instructs Ninlil to go bathe in the river.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=44}} Ninlil goes to the river, where Enlil seduces her and impregnates her with their son, the moon-god [[Sin (god)|Nanna]].{{snf|Jacobsen|1946|pages=128\u2013152}} Because of this, Enlil is banished to [[Kur]], the Sumerian underworld.{{snf|Jacobsen|1946|pages=128\u2013152}} Ninlil follows Enlil to the underworld, where he impersonates the \"man of the gate\".{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=44\u201345}} Ninlil demands to know where Enlil has gone, but Enlil, still impersonating the gatekeeper, refuses to answer.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=44\u201345}} He then seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with [[Nergal]], the god of death.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=45}} The same scenario repeats, only this time Enlil instead impersonates the \"man of the river of the nether world, the man-devouring river\"; once again, he seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with the god [[Ninazu]].{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=46}} Finally, Enlil impersonates the \"[[Urshanabi|man of the boat]]\"; once again, he seduces Ninlil and impregnates her with [[Enbilulu]], the \"inspector of the canals\".{{snf|Black|Cunningham|Robson|2006|page=106}}\n\nThe story of Enlil's courtship with Ninlil is primarily a genealogical myth invented to explain the origins of the moon-god Nanna, as well as the various gods of the Underworld,{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=43}} but it is also, to some a extent, a [[coming-of-age story]] describing Enlil and Ninlil's emergence from adolescence into adulthood.{{sfn|Leick|2013|page=66}} The story also explains Ninlil's role as Enlil's consort; in the poem, Ninlil declares, \"As Enlil is your master, so am I also your mistress!\"{{sfn|Leick|2013|page=67}} The story is also historically significance because, if the current interpretation of it is correct, it is the oldest known myth in which a god changes shape.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=43}}\n\n===Flood myth===\nIn the Sumerian version of the [[flood story]] (ETCSL [http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.7.4# 1.7.4]), the causes of the flood are unclear because the portion of the tablet recording the beginning of the story has been destroyed.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=97}} Somehow, a mortal known as [[Ziusudra]] manages to survive the flood, likely through the help of the god [[Enki]].{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=97\u201398}} The tablet begins in the middle of the description of the flood.{{snf|Kramer|1961|pages=97\u201398}} The flood lasts for seven days and seven nights before it subsides.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}} Then, [[Utu]], the god of the Sun, emerges.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}} Ziusudra opens a window in the side of the boat and falls down prostrate before the god.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}} Next, he sacrifices an ox and a sheep in honor of Utu.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}} At this point, the text breaks off again.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}} When it picks back up, Enlil and An are in the midst of declaring Ziusudra immortal as an honor for having managed to survive the flood. The remaining portion of the tablet after this point is destroyed.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}}\n\nIn the later Akkadian version of the flood story, recorded in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Enlil actually causes the flood,{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=109}} seeking to annihilate every living thing on earth because the humans, who are vastly overpopulated, make too much noise and prevent him from sleeping.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=109\u2013111}} In this version of the story, the hero is [[Utnapishtim]],{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=109\u2013110}} who is warned ahead of time by [[Enki|Ea]], the Babylonian equivalent of Enki, that the flood is coming.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=110\u2013111}} The flood lasts for seven days; when it ends, [[Ishtar]], who had mourned the destruction of humanity,{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=113}} promises Utnapishtim that Enlil will never cause a flood again.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=114\u2013115}} When Enlil sees that Utnapishtim and his family have survived, he is outraged,{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=115}} but his son [[Ninurta]] speaks up in favor of humanity, arguing that, instead of causing floods, Enlil should simply ensure that humans never become overpopulated by reducing their numbers using wild animals and famines.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=115\u2013116}} Enlil goes into the boat; Utnapishtim and his wife bow before him.{{snf|Dalley|1989|pages=115\u2013116}} Enlil, now appeased, grants Utnapishtim immortality as a reward for his loyalty to the gods.{{snf|Dalley|1989|page=116}}\n\n===Chief god and

Objects of study include interactions of [[organism]]s with each other and with [[abiotic component]]s of their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest include the [[biodiversity]], distribution, [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]], and [[population]]s of organisms, as well as cooperation and competition within and between [[species]]. [[Ecosystems]] are dynamically interacting systems of [[organisms]], the [[Community (ecology)|communities]] they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as [[primary production]], [[pedogenesis]], [[nutrient cycling]], and [[niche construction]], regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits. Biodiversity means the varieties of [[species]], [[gene]]s, and [[ecosystem]]s, enhances certain [[ecosystem services]].\n\nEcology is not synonymous with [[environmentalism]], natural history, or [[environmental science]]. It overlaps with the closely related sciences of [[evolutionary biology]], [[genetics]], and [[ethology]]. An important focus for ecologists is to improve the understanding of how biodiversity affects ecological function. Ecologists seek to explain:\n\n* Life processes, interactions, and [[adaptations]]\n* The movement of materials and [[energy]] through living communities\n* The [[ecological succession|successional]] development of ecosystems\n* The [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and distribution of organisms and biodiversity in the context of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].\n\nEcology has practical applications in [[conservation biology]], wetland management, [[natural resource management]] ([[agroecology]], [[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[agroforestry]], [[fisheries]]), city planning ([[urban ecology]]), [[community health]], [[Ecological economics|economics]], [[basic science|basic]] and [[applied science]], and human social interaction ([[human ecology]]). For example, the ''[[Circles of Sustainability]]'' approach treats ecology as more than the environment 'out there'. It is not treated as separate from humans. Organisms (including humans) and [[Resource (biology)|resources]] compose [[ecosystem]]s which, in turn, maintain [[Biophysics|biophysical]] feedback mechanisms that moderate processes  acting on living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[abiotic]]) components of the planet. Ecosystems sustain life-supporting functions and produce [[natural capital]] like  [[Biomass |biomass production]] (food, fuel, fiber, and medicine), the regulation of [[climate]], global [[biogeochemical cycles]], [[water filtration]], [[soil formation]], erosion control, flood protection, and many other natural features of scientific, historical, economic, or intrinsic value.\n\nThe word \"ecology\" (\"\u00d6kologie\") was coined in [[1866]] by the German scientist [[Ernst Haeckel]]. Ecological thought is derivative of established currents in philosophy, particularly from ethics and politics.<ref name=\"Laferri\u00e8reStoett2003\">{{cite book|author1=Eric Laferri\u00e8re|author2=Peter J.

Modern ecology became a much more rigorous [[natural sciences|science]] in the late 19th century. [[Evolution]]ary concepts relating to adaptation and [[natural selection]] became the cornerstones of modern [[Theoretical ecology|ecological theory]].\n\n== Levels, scope, and scale of organization ==\n\nThe scope of ecology contains a wide array of interacting levels of organization spanning micro-level (e.g., [[cell (biology)|cells]]) to a planetary scale (e.g., [[Earth's spheres|biosphere]]) [[phenomena]]. Ecosystems, for example, contain abiotic [[Resource (biology)|resources]] and interacting life forms (i.e., individual organisms that aggregate into [[population]]s which aggregate into distinct ecological communities). Ecosystems are dynamic, they do not always follow a linear successional path, but they are always changing, sometimes rapidly and sometimes so slowly that it can take thousands of years for ecological processes to bring about certain [[ecological succession|successional stages]] of a forest. An ecosystem's area can vary greatly, from tiny to vast. A single tree is of little consequence to the classification of a forest ecosystem, but critically relevant to organisms living in and on it.<ref name=\"Stadler98\"/> Several generations of an [[aphid]] population can exist over the lifespan of a single leaf. Each of those aphids, in turn, support diverse [[bacteria]]l communities.<ref name=\"Humphreys97\"/> The nature of connections in ecological communities cannot be explained by knowing the details of each species in isolation, because the emergent pattern is neither revealed nor predicted until the ecosystem is studied as an integrated whole.<ref name=Liere2012>{{cite journal|last=Liere|first=Heidi|author2=Jackson, Doug|author3=Vandermeer, John|author4=Wilby, Andrew|title=Ecological Complexity in a Coffee Agroecosystem: Spatial Heterogeneity, Population Persistence and Biological Control|journal=PLoS ONE | date=20 September 2012|volume=7|issue=9 | pages=e45508 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0045508|bibcode = 2012PLoSO...745508L |pmid=23029061|pmc=3447771}}</ref> Some ecological principles, however, do exhibit collective properties where the sum of the components explain the properties of the whole, such as birth rates of a population being equal to the sum of individual births over a designated time frame.<ref name=\"Odum05\" />\n\nThe main subdisciplines of ecology, [[population ecology|population]] (or [[community ecology|community]]) ecology and [[ecosystem ecology]], exhibit a difference not only of scale, but also of two contrasting paradigms in the field.

Hence, ecologists classify [[ecosystems]] hierarchically by analyzing data collected from finer scale units, such as vegetation associations, climate, and soil types, and integrate this information to identify emergent patterns of uniform organization and processes that operate on local to regional, [[landscape]], and chronological scales.\n\nTo structure the study of ecology into a conceptually manageable framework, the biological world is organized into a [[Biological organisation|nested hierarchy]], ranging in scale from [[gene]]s, to [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, to [[tissue (biology)|tissues]], to [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]], to [[organism]]s, to [[species]], to [[population ecology|population]]s, to [[Community (ecology)|communities]], to [[ecosystem]]s, to [[biome]]s, and up to the level of the [[biosphere]].<ref name=\"Nachtomy01\"/> This framework forms a [[panarchy]]<ref name=\"Holling01\"/> and exhibits [[non-linear]] behaviors; this means that \"effect and cause are disproportionate, so that small changes to critical variables, such as the number of [[nitrogen fixation|nitrogen fixers]], can lead to disproportionate, perhaps irreversible, changes in the system properties.\"<ref name=\"Levin99\"/>{{rp|14}}\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n{{main|Biodiversity}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes.

Habitat shifts provide important evidence of competition in nature where one population changes relative to the habitats that most other individuals of the species occupy. For example, one population of a species of tropical lizards (''Tropidurus hispidus'') has a flattened body relative to the main populations that live in open savanna. The population that lives in an isolated rock outcrop hides in crevasses where its flattened body offers a selective advantage. Habitat shifts also occur in the developmental [[life history theory|life history]] of amphibians, and in insects that transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. [[Biotope]] and habitat are sometimes used interchangeably, but the former applies to a community's environment, whereas the latter applies to a species' environment.<ref name=\"Whittaker73\"/><ref name=\"Schoener75\"/><ref name=\"Vitt97\"/>\n\n=== Niche ===\n{{Main|Ecological niche}}\n\n[[File:Termite mound-Tanzania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Termite]] mounds with varied heights of chimneys regulate gas exchange, temperature and other environmental parameters that are needed to sustain the internal physiology of the entire colony.<ref name=\"Laland99\" /><ref name=\"Hughes08\"/>]]\n\nDefinitions of the niche date back to 1917,<ref name=\"Wiens05\"/> but [[G.

The fundamental niche is the set of environmental conditions under which a species is able to persist. The realized niche is the set of environmental plus ecological conditions under which a species persists.<ref name=\"Wiens05\"/><ref name=\"Hutchinson57b\"/><ref name=\"Begon05\"/> The Hutchinsonian niche is defined more technically as a \"[[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] [[N-dimensional space|hyperspace]] whose ''dimensions'' are defined as environmental variables and whose ''size'' is a function of the number of values that the environmental values may assume for which an organism has ''positive fitness''.\"<ref name=\"Hardesty75\"/>{{rp|71}}\n\n[[Biogeography|Biogeographical]] patterns and [[Range (biology)|range]] distributions are explained or predicted through knowledge of a species' [[trait (biology)|traits]] and niche requirements.<ref name=\"Pearman08\"/> Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, [[phenotype]], or [[Phenotypic trait|characteristic]] of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes play an important role in the interplay of development and environmental expression of traits.<ref name=\"Levins80\" /> Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The [[competitive exclusion principle]] states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting [[Resource (biology)|resource]]; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements.<ref name=\"Hardin60\"/> Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities.<ref name=\"Scheffer06\"/> The habitat plus the niche is called the [[ecotope]], which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.<ref name=\"Whittaker73\" />\n\n===Niche construction===\n{{Main|Niche construction}}\n{{See also|Ecosystem engineering}}\n\nOrganisms are subject to environmental pressures, but they also modify their habitats. The [[negative feedback|regulatory feedback]] between organisms and their environment can affect conditions from local (e.g., a [[beaver]] [[pond]]) to global scales, over time and even after death, such as decaying logs or [[silica]] skeleton deposits from marine organisms.<ref name=\"Hastings07\"/> The process and concept of [[ecosystem engineering]] is related to [[niche construction]], but the former relates only to the physical modifications of the habitat whereas the latter also considers the evolutionary implications of physical changes to the environment and the feedback this causes on the process of natural selection. Ecosystem engineers are defined as: \"organisms that directly or indirectly modulate the availability of resources to other species, by causing physical state changes in biotic or abiotic materials. In so doing they modify, maintain and create habitats.\"<ref name=\"Jones94\"/>{{Rp|373}}\n\nThe ecosystem engineering concept has stimulated a new appreciation for the influence that organisms have on the ecosystem and evolutionary process. The term \"niche construction\" is more often used in reference to the under-appreciated feedback mechanisms of natural selection imparting forces on the abiotic niche.<ref name=\"Laland99\"/><ref name=\"Write06\"/> An example of natural selection through ecosystem engineering occurs in the nests of [[social insects]], including ants, bees, wasps, and termites. There is an emergent [[homeostasis]] or [[homeorhesis]] in the structure of the nest that regulates, maintains and defends the physiology of the entire colony. Termite mounds, for example, maintain a constant internal temperature through the design of air-conditioning chimneys. The structure of the nests themselves are subject to the forces of natural selection. Moreover, a nest can survive over successive generations, so that progeny inherit both genetic material and a legacy niche that was constructed before their time.<ref name=\"Odum05\" /><ref name=\"Laland99\"/><ref name=\"Hughes08\"/>\n\n=== Biome ===\n{{main|Biome}}\n\nBiomes are larger units of organization that categorize regions of the Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation.<ref name=\"Palmer94\"/> There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include [[tropical rainforest]], [[temperate broadleaf and mixed forest]], [[temperate deciduous forest]], [[taiga]], [[tundra]], [[hot desert]], and [[polar desert]].<ref name=\"Prentice92\"/> Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic [[microbiome]]s.

[[Ecological relationship]]s regulate the flux of energy, nutrients, and climate all the way up to the planetary scale. For example, the dynamic history of the planetary atmosphere's CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> composition has been affected by the biogenic flux of gases coming from respiration and photosynthesis, with levels fluctuating over time in relation to the ecology and evolution of plants and animals.<ref name=\"igamberdiev06\"/> Ecological theory has also been used to explain self-emergent regulatory phenomena at the planetary scale: for example, the [[Gaia hypothesis]] is an example of [[holism]] applied in ecological theory.<ref name=\"Lovelock73\"/> The Gaia hypothesis states that there is an emergent [[feedback loop]] generated by the [[metabolic theory of ecology|metabolism]] of living organisms that maintains the core temperature of the Earth and atmospheric conditions within a narrow self-regulating range of tolerance.<ref name=\"Lovelock03\"/>\n\n=== Population ecology ===\n{{Main|Population ecology}}\n{{See also|Lists of organisms by population}}\n\nPopulation ecology studies the dynamics of species populations and how these populations interact with the wider environment.<ref name=\"Odum05\" /> A population consists of individuals of the same species that live, interact, and migrate through the same niche and habitat.<ref name=\"Waples06\"/>\n\nA primary law of population ecology is the [[Malthusian growth model]]<ref name=\"Turchin01\"/> which states, \"a population will grow (or decline) exponentially as long as the environment experienced by all individuals in the population remains constant.\"<ref name=\"Turchin01\" />{{Rp|18}} Simplified population [[Scientific modelling|models]] usually start with four variables: death, birth, [[immigration]], and [[emigration]].\n\nAn example of an introductory population model describes a closed population, such as on an island, where immigration and emigration does not take place. Hypotheses are evaluated with reference to a null hypothesis which states that [[random]] processes create the observed data. In these island models, the rate of population change is described by:\n: <math>\\frac{\\operatorname{d}N}{\\operatorname{d}T} = bN - dN = (b - d)N = rN, </math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the total number of individuals in the population, ''b'' and ''d'' are the per capita rates of birth and death respectively, and ''r'' is the per capita rate of population change.<ref name=\"Turchin01\"/><ref name=\"Vandermeer03\"/>\n\nUsing these modelling techniques, Malthus' population principle of growth was later transformed into a model known as the [[Law of population growth|logistic equation]]:\n: <math>\\frac{dN}{dT} = aN\\left(1-\\frac{N}{K}\\right),</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of individuals measured as [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]] density, ''a'' is the maximum per-capita rate of change, and ''K'' is the [[carrying capacity]] of the population. The formula states that the rate of change in population size (''dN/dT'') is equal to growth (''aN'') that is limited by carrying capacity (1&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;''N''/''K'').\n\nPopulation ecology builds upon these introductory models to further understand demographic processes in real study populations. Commonly used types of data include [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[fecundity]], and survivorship, and these are analysed using mathematical techniques such as [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix algebra]]. The information is used for managing wildlife stocks and setting harvest quotas.<ref name=\"Vandermeer03\" /><ref name=\"Berryman92\"/> In cases where basic models are insufficient, ecologists may adopt different kinds of statistical methods, such as the [[Akaike information criterion]],<ref name=\"Anderson00\">{{cite journal | last1=Anderson | first1=D.

Animal migration is set apart from other kinds of movement; because, it involves the seasonal departure and return of individuals from a habitat.<ref name=\"Nebel10\"/> Migration is also a population-level phenomenon, as with the migration routes followed by plants as they occupied northern post-glacial environments. Plant ecologists use pollen records that accumulate and stratify in wetlands to reconstruct the timing of plant migration and dispersal relative to historic and contemporary climates. These migration routes involved an expansion of the range as plant populations expanded from one area to another. There is a larger taxonomy of movement, such as commuting, foraging, territorial behaviour, stasis, and ranging. Dispersal is usually distinguished from migration; because, it involves the one way permanent movement of individuals from their birth population into another population.<ref name=\"Clark98\"/><ref name=\"Dingle96\"/>\n\nIn metapopulation terminology, migrating individuals are classed as emigrants (when they leave a region) or immigrants (when they enter a region), and sites are classed either as sources or sinks. A site is a generic term that refers to places where ecologists sample populations, such as ponds or defined sampling areas in a forest. Source patches are productive sites that generate a seasonal supply of [[Juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] that migrate to other patch locations. Sink patches are unproductive sites that only receive migrants; the population at the site will disappear unless rescued by an adjacent source patch or environmental conditions become more favourable. Metapopulation models examine patch dynamics over time to answer potential questions about spatial and demographic ecology. The ecology of metapopulations is a dynamic process of extinction and colonization. Small patches of lower quality (i.e., sinks) are maintained or rescued by a seasonal influx of new immigrants. A dynamic metapopulation structure evolves from year to year, where some patches are sinks in dry years and are sources when conditions are more favourable. Ecologists use a mixture of computer models and [[field study|field studies]] to explain metapopulation structure.<ref name=\"Hanski04\"/><ref name=\"MacKenzie06\"/>\n\n=== Community ecology ===\n[[File:Male Lion and Cub Chitwa South Africa Luca Galuzzi 2004 edit1.jpg|thumb|right|Interspecific interactions such as [[predation]] are a key aspect of [[community ecology]].]]\n\n{{Main|Community ecology}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = Community ecology examines how interactions among species and their environment affect the abundance, distribution and diversity of species within communities.\n| source = Johnson & Stinchcomb (2007)<ref name=\"Johnson07\" />{{Rp|250}}\n| width = 25%\n| align = left}}\n\nCommunity ecology is the study of the interactions among a collections of species that inhabit the same geographic area.

Ecosystem ecology is the science of determining the fluxes of materials (e.g. carbon, phosphorus) between different pools (e.g., tree biomass, soil organic material). Ecosystem ecologist attempt to determine the underlying causes of these fluxes. Research in ecosystem ecology might measure [[primary production]] (g C/m^2) in a [[wetland]] in relation to decomposition and consumption rates (g C/m^2/y).

Differences stem from the nature of the unique physical environments that shapes the biodiversity within each. A more recent addition to ecosystem ecology are [[technoecosystems]], which are affected by or primarily the result of human activity.<ref name=\"Odum05\" />\n\n=== Food webs ===\n{{Main|Food web}}\n{{See also|Food chain}}\n\n[[File:Chesapeake Waterbird Food Web.jpg|thumb|right|Generalized food web of waterbirds from [[Chesapeake Bay]]]]\n\nA food web is the archetypal [[ecological network]]. Plants capture [[solar energy]] and use it to synthesize [[simple sugars]] during [[photosynthesis]]. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing [[herbivores]], and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal [[trophic species]] to a top consumer is called the [[food chain]]. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of [[concept map]] or a [[heuristic]] device that is used to illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.<ref name=\"O'Neill86\"/><ref name=\"Pimm02\"/><ref name=\"Pimm91\"/>\n\nFood webs are often limited relative to the real world. Complete empirical measurements are generally restricted to a specific habitat, such as a cave or a pond, and principles gleaned from food web [[Microcosm (experimental ecosystem)|microcosm]] studies are extrapolated to larger systems.<ref name=\"Worm03\"/> Feeding relations require extensive investigations into the gut contents of organisms, which can be difficult to decipher, or stable isotopes can be used to trace the flow of nutrient diets and energy through a food web.<ref name=\"McCann07\"/> Despite these limitations, food webs remain a valuable tool in understanding community ecosystems.<ref name=\"Wilbur97\"/>\n\nFood webs exhibit principles of ecological emergence through the nature of trophic relationships: some species have many weak feeding links (e.g., [[omnivores]]) while some are more specialized with fewer stronger feeding links (e.g., [[predator|primary predators]]). Theoretical and empirical studies identify [[Random#In biology|non-random]] emergent patterns of few strong and many weak linkages that explain how ecological communities remain stable over time.<ref name=\"Emmerson\"/> Food webs are composed of subgroups where members in a community are linked by strong interactions, and the weak interactions occur between these subgroups.

The trophic pyramid roughly represents the biomass (usually measured as total dry-weight) at each level. Plants generally have the greatest biomass. Names of trophic categories are shown to the right of the pyramid. Some ecosystems, such as many wetlands, do not organize as a strict pyramid, because aquatic plants are not as productive as long-lived terrestrial plants such as trees. Ecological trophic pyramids are typically one of three kinds: 1) pyramid of numbers, 2) pyramid of biomass, or 3) pyramid of energy.<ref name=\"Odum05\"/>{{rp|598}}]]\n\nA trophic level (from Greek ''troph'', \u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae, troph\u0113, meaning \"food\" or \"feeding\") is \"a group of organisms acquiring a considerable majority of its energy from the lower adjacent level (according to [[ecological pyramid]]s) nearer the abiotic source.\"<ref name=\"Hariston93\"/>{{rp|383}} Links in food webs primarily connect feeding relations or [[trophism]] among species. Biodiversity within ecosystems can be organized into trophic pyramids, in which the vertical dimension represents feeding relations that become further removed from the base of the food chain up toward top predators, and the horizontal dimension represents the [[Relative species abundance|abundance]] or biomass at each level.<ref name=\"Duffy07\"/> When the relative abundance or biomass of each species is sorted into its respective trophic level, they naturally sort into a 'pyramid of numbers'.<ref name=\"Elton27\" />\n\nSpecies are broadly categorized as [[autotrophs]] (or [[primary producers]]), [[heterotrophs]] (or [[consumer]]s), and [[Detritivore]]s (or [[decomposers]]). Autotrophs are organisms that produce their own food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or [[chemosynthesis]]. Heterotrophs are organisms that must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production).<ref name=\"Odum05\" /> Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including [[primary consumers]] (strict herbivores), [[Trophic dynamics|secondary consumers]] ([[carnivorous]] predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators).<ref name=\"David03\"/> Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It has been suggested that omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.<ref name=\"Oksanen91\"/>\n\nTrophic levels are part of the [[holistic]] or [[complex systems]] view of ecosystems.<ref name=\"Loehle88\"/><ref name=\"Ulanowicz79\"/> Each trophic level contains unrelated species that are grouped together because they share common ecological functions, giving a macroscopic view of the system.<ref name=\"Li00\"/> While the notion of trophic levels provides insight into energy flow and top-down control within food webs, it is troubled by the prevalence of omnivory in real ecosystems. This has led some ecologists to \"reiterate that the notion that species clearly aggregate into discrete, homogeneous trophic levels is fiction.\"<ref name=\"Polis96\"/>{{rp|815}} Nonetheless, recent studies have shown that real trophic levels do exist, but \"above the herbivore trophic level, food webs are better characterized as a tangled web of omnivores.\"<ref name=\"Thompson07\"/>{{rp|612}}\n\n=== Keystone species ===\n{{main|Keystone species}}\n[[File:Sea otters holding hands, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Sea otter]]s, an example of a keystone species]]\nA keystone species is a species that is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the [[food-web]]. Keystone species have lower levels of biomass in the trophic pyramid relative to the importance of their role. The many connections that a keystone species holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.<ref name=\"Fisher06\"/><ref name=\"Libralato06\"/>\n\n[[Sea otter]]s (''Enhydra lutris'') are commonly cited as an example of a keystone species; because, they limit the density of [[sea urchins]] that feed on [[kelp]]. If sea otters are removed from the system, the urchins graze until the kelp beds disappear, and this has a dramatic effect on community structure.<ref name=\"Mills93\"/> Hunting of sea otters, for example, is thought to have led indirectly to the extinction of the [[Steller's sea cow]] (''Hydrodamalis gigas'').<ref name=\"Anderson95\"/> While the keystone species concept has been used extensively as a [[Conservation biology|conservation]] tool, it has been criticized for being poorly defined from an operational stance. It is difficult to experimentally determine what species may hold a keystone role in each ecosystem. Furthermore, food web theory suggests that keystone species may not be common, so it is unclear how generally the keystone species model can be applied.<ref name=\"Mills93\"/><ref name=\"Polis00\"/>\n\n== Ecological complexity ==\n{{Main|Complexity}}\n{{See also|Emergence}}\n\nComplexity is understood as a large computational effort needed to piece together numerous interacting parts exceeding the iterative memory capacity of the human mind. Global patterns of biological diversity are complex. This [[biocomplexity]] stems from the interplay among ecological processes that operate and influence patterns at different scales that grade into each other, such as transitional areas or [[ecotones]] spanning landscapes. Complexity stems from the interplay among levels of biological organization as energy, and matter is integrated into larger units that superimpose onto the smaller parts. \"What were wholes on one level become parts on a higher one.\"<ref name=\"Novikoff45\"/>{{rp|209}} Small scale patterns do not necessarily explain large scale phenomena, otherwise captured in the expression (coined by Aristotle) 'the sum is greater than the parts'.<ref name=\"Schneider01\"/><ref name=\"Molnar04\"/>{{Cref2|E}}\n\n\"Complexity in ecology is of at least six distinct types: spatial, temporal, structural, process, behavioral, and geometric.\"<ref name=\"Loehle04\"/>{{rp|3}} From these principles, ecologists have identified [[emergence|emergent]] and [[Self-organization#Self-organization in biology|self-organizing]] phenomena that operate at different environmental scales of influence, ranging from molecular to planetary, and these require different explanations at each integrative level.<ref name=\"Lovelock03\" /><ref name=\"Odum1977\"/> Ecological complexity relates to the dynamic resilience of ecosystems that transition to multiple shifting steady-states directed by random fluctuations of history.<ref name=\"Holling01\"/><ref name=\"Carpenter01\"/> Long-term ecological studies provide important track records to better understand the complexity and resilience of ecosystems over longer temporal and broader spatial scales.

Holism addresses the [[Biological organisation|biological organization]] of life that [[Systems biology|self-organizes]] into layers of emergent whole systems that function according to non-reducible properties. This means that higher order patterns of a whole functional system, such as an [[ecosystem]], cannot be predicted or understood by a simple summation of the parts.<ref name=\"Liu09\"/> \"New properties emerge because the components interact, not because the basic nature of the components is changed.\"<ref name=\"Odum05\"/>{{rp|8}}\n\nEcological studies are necessarily holistic as opposed to [[reductionistic]].<ref name=\"Levins80\" /><ref name=\"Odum1977\"/><ref name=\"Mikkelson10\"/> Holism has three scientific meanings or uses that identify with ecology: 1) the mechanistic complexity of ecosystems, 2) the practical description of patterns in quantitative reductionist terms where correlations may be identified but nothing is understood about the causal relations without reference to the whole system, which leads to 3) a [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] hierarchy whereby the causal relations of larger systems are understood without reference to the smaller parts. Scientific holism differs from [[mysticism]] that has appropriated the same term. An example of metaphysical holism is identified in the trend of increased exterior thickness in shells of different species. The reason for a thickness increase can be understood through reference to principles of natural selection via predation without need to reference or understand the [[biomolecular]] properties of the exterior shells.<ref name=\"Wilson88\"/>\n\n== Relation to evolution ==\n{{main|Evolutionary ecology}}\n\nEcology and evolutionary biology are considered sister disciplines of the life sciences. [[Natural selection]], [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[Developmental biology|development]], [[adaptation]], [[populations]], and [[heredity|inheritance]] are examples of concepts that thread equally into ecological and evolutionary theory. Morphological, behavioural, and genetic traits, for example, can be mapped onto evolutionary trees to study the historical development of a species in relation to their functions and roles in different ecological circumstances. In this framework, the analytical tools of ecologists and evolutionists overlap as they organize, classify, and investigate life through common systematic principals, such as [[phylogenetics]] or the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean system of taxonomy]].<ref name=\"Miles93\"/> The two disciplines often appear together, such as in the title of the journal ''[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]]''.<ref name=\"TREE\">{{cite web | editor-last=Craze | editor-first=P. | title=Trends in Ecology and Evolution | publisher=Cell Press, Elsevier, Inc | url=http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | date=2 August 2012 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090724103422/http://www.cell.com/trends/ecology-evolution/home | archivedate=24 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> There is no sharp boundary separating ecology from evolution, and they differ more in their areas of applied focus.

Even plants express complex behaviour, including memory and communication.<ref name=\"Karban08\"/> Behavioural ecology is the study of an organism's behaviour in its environment and its ecological and evolutionary implications. Ethology is the study of observable movement or behaviour in animals. This could include investigations of motile [[sperm]] of plants, mobile [[phytoplankton]], [[zooplankton]] swimming toward the female egg, the cultivation of fungi by [[weevils]], the mating dance of a [[salamander]], or social gatherings of [[amoeba]].<ref name=\"Tinbergen63\"/><ref name=\"Hamner85\"/><ref name=\"Strassmann00\"/><ref name=\"Sakurai85\"/><ref name=\"Anderson61\"/>\n\nAdaptation is the central unifying concept in behavioural ecology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.behavecol.com/pages/society/welcome.html |title=Behavioral Ecology |publisher=International Society for Behavioral Ecology |accessdate=15 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410105207/http://www.behavecol.com/pages/society/welcome.html |archivedate=10 April 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited in much the same way that eye and hair colour can.

Many prey species are faced with multiple predators that differ in the degree of danger posed. To be adapted to their environment and face predatory threats, organisms must balance their energy budgets as they invest in different aspects of their life history, such as growth, feeding, mating, socializing, or modifying their habitat. Hypotheses posited in behavioural ecology are generally based on adaptive principles of conservation, optimization, or efficiency.<ref name=\"Begon05\"/><ref name=\"Allee49\"/><ref name=\"Krebs93\"/> For example, \"[t]he threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis predicts that prey should assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and match their behaviour according to current levels of risk\"<ref name=\"Webb10\"/> or \"[t]he optimal [[Escape distance|flight initiation distance]] occurs where expected postencounter fitness is maximized, which depends on the prey's initial fitness, benefits obtainable by not fleeing, energetic escape costs, and expected fitness loss due to predation risk.\"<ref name=\"Cooper10\"/>\n\nElaborate sexual [[display (zoology)|displays]] and posturing are encountered in the behavioural ecology of animals. The [[birds-of-paradise]], for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during [[courtship]]. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by [[sexual selection]] as an advertisement of quality of traits among [[suitors]].<ref name=\"Kodric-Brown84\"/>\n\n=== Cognitive ecology ===\n\nCognitive ecology integrates theory and observations from [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[neurobiology]], primarily [[cognitive science]], in order to understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems and how those systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework.<ref name=Palacios>{{cite journal |journal=Biology Research |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=95\u201399 |year=2003 |title=An \"enactive\" approach to integrative and comparative biology: Thoughts on the table |author=Adrian G Palacios, Francisco Bozinovic |url=http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |doi=10.4067/S0716-97602003000100008 |pmid=12795209 |last2=Bozinovic |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623182048/http://www.bio.puc.cl/caseb/casebpdf/P,%20y%20Bozinovic1.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> \"Until recently, however, cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings.

Social behaviours include reciprocally beneficial behaviours among kin and nest mates<ref name=\"Strassmann00\" /><ref name=\"Wilson00\" /><ref name=\"Sherman95\"/> and evolve from kin and group selection. [[Kin selection]] explains altruism through genetic relationships, whereby an altruistic behaviour leading to death is rewarded by the survival of genetic copies distributed among surviving relatives. The social insects, including [[ant]]s, [[bee]]s, and [[wasp]]s are most famously studied for this type of relationship because the male drones are [[Cloning|clones]] that share the same genetic make-up as every other male in the colony.<ref name=\"Wilson00\" /> In contrast, [[group selection]]ists find examples of altruism among non-genetic relatives and explain this through selection acting on the group; whereby, it becomes selectively advantageous for groups if their members express altruistic behaviours to one another. Groups with predominantly altruistic members beat groups with predominantly selfish members.<ref name=\"Wilson00\" /><ref name=\"Wilson07\"/>\n\n=== Coevolution ===\n{{main|Coevolution}}\n[[File:Bombus 6867.JPG|thumb|right|[[Bumblebee]]s and the [[flower]]s they [[pollination|pollinate]] have coevolved so that both have become dependent on each other for survival.]]\n[[File:Parasitismus.jpg|thumb|upright|'''Parasitism:''' A harvestman [[arachnid]] being parasitized by [[mite]]s. The harvestman is being consumed, while the mites benefit from traveling on and feeding off of their host.]]\n\nEcological interactions can be classified broadly into a [[host (biology)|host]] and an associate relationship. A host is any entity that harbours another that is called the associate.<ref name=\"Page91\"/> Relationships [[Interspecific interaction|within a species]] that are mutually or reciprocally beneficial are called [[mutualisms]]. Examples of mutualism include [[fungus-growing ants]] employing agricultural symbiosis, bacteria living in the guts of insects and other organisms, the [[fig wasp]] and [[yucca moth]] pollination complex, [[lichen]]s with fungi and photosynthetic [[algae]], and [[coral]]s with photosynthetic algae.<ref name=\"Herre99\"/><ref name=\"Gilbert90\"/> If there is a physical connection between host and associate, the relationship is called [[symbiosis]]. Approximately 60% of all plants, for example, have a symbiotic relationship with [[arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi]] living in their roots forming an exchange network of carbohydrates for [[nutrients|mineral nutrients]].<ref name=\"Kiers06\"/>\n\nIndirect mutualisms occur where the organisms live apart. For example, trees living in the equatorial regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called [[commensalism]]; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen.<ref name=\"Odum05\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Strain | first1=B. R.|year=1985|title=Physiological and ecological controls on carbon sequestering in terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=1|issue=3|pages=219\u2013232|doi=10.1007/BF02187200}}</ref> If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called [[parasitism]]. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or [[propagule]]s, denying the services of a beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast.<ref name=\"Bronstein01\"/><ref name=\"Irwin10\"/> Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The [[Red Queen Hypothesis]], for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.<ref name=\"Boucher82\"/><ref name=\"King09\">{{cite journal | last1=King | first1=K.

For example, [[Island biogeography|the theory of island biogeography]], published by the Robert MacArthur and [[Edward O. Wilson]] in 1967<ref name=\"MacArthur67\" /> is considered one of the fundamentals of ecological theory.<ref name=\"Wiens04\"/>\n\nBiogeography has a long history in the natural sciences concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies.<ref name=\"Parenti90\" /> Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as [[Animal migration|migration]] and [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]].<ref name=\"Wiens04\" /> and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called [[Allopatric speciation|vicariance biogeography]] and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography.<ref name=\"Morrone95\"/> There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning ecological systems and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of [[global warming]].<ref name=\"Svennin08\" /><ref name=\"Landh\u00e4usser09\"/>\n\n==== r/K selection theory ====\n{{Main|r/K selection theory}}\n\nA population ecology concept is r/K selection theory,{{Cref2|D}} one of the first predictive models in ecology used to explain [[Life history theory|life-history evolution]]. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to [[population densities|population density]]. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for rapid population growth. These early phases of [[population growth]] experience ''density-independent'' forces of natural selection, which is called ''r''-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, it approaches the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called ''K''-selection.<ref name=\"Reznick02\"/>\n\nIn the ''r/K''-selection model, the first variable ''r'' is the intrinsic rate of natural increase in population size and the second variable ''K'' is the carrying capacity of a population.<ref name=\"Begon05\" /> Different species evolve different life-history strategies spanning a continuum between these two selective forces. An ''r''-selected species is one that has high birth rates, low levels of parental investment, and high rates of mortality before individuals reach maturity. Evolution favours high rates of [[fecundity]] in ''r''-selected species. Many kinds of insects and [[invasive species]] exhibit ''r''-selected [[Phenotypic trait|characteristics]]. In contrast, a ''K''-selected species has low rates of fecundity, high levels of parental investment in the young, and low rates of mortality as individuals mature. Humans and elephants are examples of species exhibiting ''K''-selected characteristics, including longevity and efficiency in the conversion of more resources into fewer offspring.<ref name=\"MacArthur67\"/><ref name=\"Pianka72\"/>\n\n=== Molecular ecology ===\n{{Main|Molecular ecology}}\n\nThe important relationship between ecology and genetic inheritance predates modern techniques for molecular analysis. Molecular ecological research became more feasible with the development of rapid and accessible genetic technologies, such as the [[Polymerase chain reaction|polymerase chain reaction (PCR)]]. The rise of molecular technologies and influx of research questions into this new ecological field resulted in the publication ''[[Molecular Ecology]]'' in 1992.<ref name=\"MolEcol\">{{Cite journal| title = Molecular Ecology | editor-last=Rieseberg | editor-first= L. | publisher = Wiley | doi = 10.1111/(ISSN)1365-294X | journal = Molecular Ecology }}</ref> [[Molecular ecology]] uses various analytical techniques to study genes in an evolutionary and ecological context. In 1994, [[John Avise]] also played a leading role in this area of science with the publication of his book, ''Molecular Markers, Natural History and Evolution''.<ref name=\"Avise94\"/> Newer technologies opened a wave of genetic analysis into organisms once difficult to study from an ecological or evolutionary standpoint, such as bacteria, fungi, and [[nematode]]s. Molecular ecology engendered a new research paradigm for investigating ecological questions considered otherwise intractable. Molecular investigations revealed previously obscured details in the tiny intricacies of nature and improved resolution into probing questions about behavioural and biogeographical ecology.<ref name=\"Avise94\"/> For example, molecular ecology revealed [[promiscuous]] sexual behaviour and multiple male partners in [[tree swallow]]s previously thought to be socially [[monogamous]].<ref name=\"Obryan07\"/> In a biogeographical context, the marriage between genetics, ecology, and evolution resulted in a new sub-discipline called [[phylogeography]].<ref name=\"Avise00\"/>\n\n== Human ecology ==\n{{Main|Human ecology}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = The history of life on Earth has been a history of interaction between living things and their surroundings.

Ecosystems produce, regulate, maintain, and supply services of critical necessity and beneficial to human health (cognitive and physiological), economies, and they even provide an information or reference function as a living library giving opportunities for science and cognitive development in children engaged in the complexity of the natural world.

It is dynamically interlinked, and contains [[Resource (biology)|resources]] for organisms at any time throughout their life cycle.<ref name=\"Odum05\" /><ref name=\"Mason57\"/> Like ecology, the term environment has different conceptual meanings and overlaps with the concept of nature. Environment \"includes the physical world, the social world of human relations and the built world of human creation.\"<ref name=\"Kleese01\"/>{{Rp|62}} The physical environment is external to the level of biological organization under investigation, including [[abiotic]] factors such as temperature, radiation, light, chemistry, [[climate]] and geology. The biotic environment includes genes, cells, organisms, members of the same species ([[conspecific]]s) and other species that share a habitat.<ref name=\"Campbell06\"/>\n\nThe distinction between external and internal environments, however, is an abstraction parsing life and environment into units or facts that are inseparable in reality. There is an interpenetration of cause and effect between the environment and life. The laws of [[thermodynamics]], for example, apply to ecology by means of its physical state. With an understanding of metabolic and thermodynamic principles, a complete accounting of energy and material flow can be traced through an ecosystem. In this way, the environmental and ecological relations are studied through reference to conceptually manageable and isolated [[materialism|material]] parts. After the effective environmental components are understood through reference to their causes; however, they conceptually link back together as an integrated whole, or ''holocoenotic'' system as it was once called. This is known as the [[dialectical]] approach to ecology. The dialectical approach examines the parts, but integrates the organism and the environment into a dynamic whole (or [[umwelt]]). Change in one ecological or environmental factor can concurrently affect the dynamic state of an entire ecosystem.<ref name=\"Levins80\" /><ref name=\"Kormondy95\"/>\n\n=== Disturbance and resilience ===\n{{Main|Resilience (ecology)}}\n\nEcosystems are regularly confronted with natural environmental variations and disturbances over time and geographic space. A disturbance is any process that removes biomass from a community, such as a fire, flood, drought, or predation.<ref name=\"Hughes10\"/> Disturbances occur over vastly different ranges in terms of magnitudes as well as distances and time periods,<ref name=\"Levin92\"/> and are both the cause and product of natural fluctuations in death rates, species assemblages, and biomass densities within an ecological community. These disturbances create places of renewal where new directions emerge from the patchwork of natural experimentation and opportunity.<ref name=\"Hughes10\"/><ref name=\"Holling73\" /><ref name=\"Folke04\"/> Ecological resilience is a cornerstone theory in ecosystem management.

These gases changed the way that light from the sun hit the Earth's surface and greenhouse effects trapped heat. There were untapped sources of free energy within the mixture of [[Redox|reducing and oxidizing]] gasses that set the stage for primitive ecosystems to evolve and, in turn, the atmosphere also evolved.<ref name=\"Wills01\"/>\n\n[[File:Leaf 1 web.jpg|left|thumb|The [[leaf]] is the primary site of [[photosynthesis]] in most plants.]]\n\nThroughout history, the Earth's atmosphere and [[biogeochemical cycles]] have been in a [[dynamic equilibrium]] with planetary ecosystems.

[[Anoxygenic photosynthesis]] reduced hydrogen concentrations and increased atmospheric methane, by converting [[hydrogen sulfide]] into water or other sulfur compounds (for example, 2H<sub>2</sub>S + CO<sub>2</sub> + h''v'' \u2192 CH<sub>2</sub>O + H<sub>2</sub>O + 2S). Early forms of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] also increased levels of atmospheric methane. The transition to an oxygen-dominant atmosphere (the ''[[Great Oxygenation Event|Great Oxidation]]'') did not begin until approximately 2.4\u20132.3&nbsp;billion years ago, but photosynthetic processes started 0.3 to 1&nbsp;billion years prior.<ref name=\"Goldblatt06\"/><ref name=\"Catling05\"/>\n\n=== Radiation: heat, temperature and light ===\n{{Anchor|Sunlight}}<!-- E.g. in [[Neritic zone]] -->\nThe biology of life operates within a certain range of temperatures. Heat is a form of energy that regulates temperature. Heat affects growth rates, activity, behaviour, and [[primary production]]. Temperature is largely dependent on the incidence of [[solar radiation]]. The latitudinal and longitudinal spatial variation of [[temperature]] greatly affects climates and consequently the distribution of [[biodiversity]] and levels of primary production in different ecosystems or biomes across the planet. Heat and temperature relate importantly to metabolic activity. [[Poikilotherms]], for example, have a body temperature that is largely regulated and dependent on the temperature of the external environment. In contrast, [[homeotherms]] regulate their internal body temperature by expending [[food energy|metabolic energy]].<ref name=\"Allee49\"/><ref name=\"Ricklefs96\"/><ref name=\"Kormondy95\"/>\n\nThere is a relationship between light, primary production, and ecological [[energy budget]]s. Sunlight is the primary input of energy into the planet's ecosystems. Light is composed of [[electromagnetic energy]] of different [[wavelength]]s. [[Radiant energy]] from the sun generates heat, provides photons of light measured as active energy in the chemical reactions of life, and also acts as a catalyst for [[genetic mutation]].<ref name=\"Allee49\"/><ref name=\"Ricklefs96\"/><ref name=\"Kormondy95\"/> Plants, algae, and some bacteria absorb light and assimilate the energy through [[photosynthesis]]. Organisms capable of assimilating energy by photosynthesis or through inorganic fixation of [[hydrogen sulfide|H<sub>2</sub>S]] are [[autotrophs]]. Autotrophs \u2014 responsible for primary production \u2014 assimilate light energy which becomes metabolically stored as [[potential energy]] in the form of biochemical [[Enthalpy|enthalpic]] bonds.<ref name=\"Allee49\"/><ref name=\"Ricklefs96\"/><ref name=\"Kormondy95\"/>\n\n=== Physical environments ===\n\n==== Water ====\n{{Main|Aquatic ecosystem}}\n{{quote box\n| quote = Wetland conditions such as shallow water, high plant productivity, and anaerobic substrates provide a suitable environment for important physical, biological, and chemical processes. Because of these processes, wetlands play a vital role in global nutrient and element cycles.\n| source = Cronk & Fennessy (2001)<ref name=\"Cronk01\" />{{Rp|29}}\n| width = 25%\n| align = right}}\nDiffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] (an environment with O<sub>2</sub> concentration below 2&nbsp;mg/liter) and eventually completely [[Anoxic waters|anoxic]] where [[anaerobic bacteria]] thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral composition]] of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles.<ref name=\"Cronk01\"/> Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces ([[aerenchyma]]) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants ([[halophytes]]) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and [[osmoregulation|osmoregulating]] their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in [[Estuary|estuarine]], [[brackish]], or [[ocean]]ic environments. Anaerobic soil [[microorganism]]s in aquatic environments use [[nitrate]], [[Manganese|manganese ions]], [[ferric|ferric ions]], [[sulfate]], [[carbon dioxide]], and some [[organic compounds]]; other microorganisms are [[facultative anaerobes]] and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the [[Reduction potential|oxidation-reduction]] potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) by methanogenic bacteria.<ref name=\"Cronk01\"/> The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form [[electrochemical gradient]]s that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.<ref name=\"Evans99\"/>\n\n==== Gravity ====\n\nThe shape and energy of the land is significantly affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of [[tectonic plates]] as well as influencing [[geomorphic]] processes such as [[orogeny]] and [[erosion]]. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth ([[gravitropism]]), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the [[biomechanics]] and size of animals.<ref name=\"Allee49\"/> Ecological traits, such as allocation of biomass in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves.<ref name=\"Swenson08\"/> The [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular systems]] of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).<ref name=\"Garnter10\"/>\n\n==== Pressure ====\n\nClimatic and [[osmotic pressure]] places [[physiological]] constraints on organisms, especially those that fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths.<ref name=\"Neri\" /> These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences.<ref name=\"Allee49\"/> For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes.<ref name=\"Jacobsen08\"/> [[Xylem|Water transportation]] by plants is another important [[ecophysiology|ecophysiological]] process affected by osmotic pressure gradients.<ref name=\"Strook08\"/><ref name=\"Pockman95\"/><ref name=\"Zimmermann02\"/> [[Fluid pressure|Water pressure]] in the depths of oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as [[whale]]s, [[dolphin|dolphins,]] and [[seal (animal)|seals]] are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences.<ref name=\"Kastak98\"/> Differences between [[hagfish]] species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.<ref name=\"Nishiguchi10\"/>\n\n==== Wind and turbulence ====\n\n[[File:Grassflowers.jpg|thumb|The architecture of the [[inflorescence]] in grasses is subject to the physical pressures of wind and shaped by the forces of natural selection facilitating wind-pollination ([[anemophily]]).<ref name=\"Friedman04\"/><ref name=\"Harder09\"/>]]\n\n[[Turbulent forces]] in air and water affect the environment and ecosystem distribution, form and dynamics. On a planetary scale, ecosystems are affected by circulation patterns in the global [[trade winds]]. Wind power and the turbulent forces it creates can influence heat, nutrient, and biochemical profiles of ecosystems.<ref name=\"Allee49\"/> For example, wind running over the surface of a lake creates turbulence, mixing the [[water column]] and influencing the environmental profile to create [[thermally layered zones]], affecting how fish, algae, and other parts of the [[aquatic ecosystem]] are structured.<ref name=\"Shimeta95\"/><ref name=\"Etemad01\"/> Wind speed and turbulence also influence [[evapotranspiration rates]] and energy budgets in plants and animals.<ref name=\"Cronk01\" /><ref name=\"Wolf96\"/> Wind speed, temperature and moisture content can vary as winds travel across different land features and elevations. For example, the [[westerlies]] come into contact with the [[coastal]] and interior mountains of western North America to produce a [[rain shadow]] on the leeward side of the mountain. The air expands and moisture condenses as the winds increase in elevation; this is called [[orographic lift]] and can cause precipitation.{{clarify|this sounds as if the rain would fall on the leeward side of the mountains, which can't be right|date=August 2012}} This environmental process produces spatial divisions in biodiversity, as species adapted to wetter conditions are range-restricted to the coastal mountain valleys and unable to migrate across the [[xeric]] ecosystems (e.g., of the [[Columbia River Drainage Basin|Columbia Basin]] in western North America) to intermix with sister lineages that are segregated to the interior mountain systems.<ref name=\"Daubenmire75\"/><ref name=\"Steele05\"/>\n\n==== Fire ====\n{{Main|Fire ecology}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| footer = Forest fires modify the land by leaving behind an environmental mosaic that diversifies the landscape into different [[seral community|seral]] stages and habitats of varied quality (left).

By approximately 350 million years ago (the end of the [[Devonian period]]), photosynthesis had brought the concentration of atmospheric oxygen above 17%, which allowed combustion to occur.<ref name=\"Lenton00\"/> Fire releases CO<sub>2</sub> and converts fuel into ash and tar. Fire is a significant ecological parameter that raises many issues pertaining to its control and suppression.<ref name=\"Lobert93\"/> While the issue of fire in relation to ecology and plants has been recognized for a long time,<ref name=\"Garren43\"/> [[Charles F. Cooper (ecologist)|Charles Cooper]] brought attention to the issue of forest fires in relation to the ecology of forest fire suppression and management in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Cooper60\"/><ref name=\"Cooper61\"/>\n\n[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native North Americans]] were among the first to influence fire regimes by controlling their spread near their homes or by lighting fires to stimulate the production of herbaceous foods and basketry materials.<ref name=\"Wagtendonk07\"/> Fire creates a heterogeneous ecosystem age and canopy structure, and the altered soil nutrient supply and cleared canopy structure opens new ecological niches for seedling establishment.<ref name=\"Boerner82\"/><ref name=\"Goubitz03\"/> Most ecosystems are adapted to natural fire cycles. Plants, for example, are equipped with a variety of adaptations to deal with forest fires. Some species (e.g., ''[[Pinus halepensis]]'') cannot [[germination|germinate]] until after their seeds have lived through a fire or been exposed to certain compounds from smoke. Environmentally triggered germination of seeds is called [[serotiny]].<ref name=\"Neeman04\"/><ref name=\"Flematti04\"/> Fire plays a major role in the persistence and [[Resilience (ecology)|resilience]] of ecosystems.<ref name=\"Holling73\"/>\n\n==== Soils ====\n{{main|Soil ecology}}\n\nSoil is the living top layer of mineral and organic dirt that covers the surface of the planet. It is the chief organizing centre of most ecosystem functions, and it is of critical importance in agricultural science and ecology. The [[decomposition]] of dead organic matter (for example, leaves on the forest floor), results in soils containing [[minerals]] and nutrients that feed into plant production. The whole of the planet's soil ecosystems is called the [[pedosphere]] where a large biomass of the Earth's biodiversity organizes into trophic levels. Invertebrates that feed and shred larger leaves, for example, create smaller bits for smaller organisms in the feeding chain. Collectively, these organisms are the [[detritivore]]s that regulate soil formation.<ref name=\"Coleman04\"/><ref name=\"Wilkinson09\"/> Tree roots, fungi, bacteria, worms, ants, beetles, centipedes, spiders, mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and other less familiar creatures all work to create the trophic web of life in soil ecosystems. Soils form composite phenotypes where inorganic matter is enveloped into the physiology of a whole community. As organisms feed and migrate through soils they physically displace materials, an ecological process called [[bioturbation]]. This aerates soils and stimulates heterotrophic growth and production. Soil [[microorganisms]] are influenced by and feed back into the trophic dynamics of the ecosystem. No single axis of causality can be discerned to segregate the biological from geomorphological systems in soils.<ref name=\"Phillips09\">{{cite journal | last1=Phillips | first1=J.

Six major elements ([[hydrogen]], [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[sulfur]], and [[phosphorus]]; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the [[biogeochemical cycle]]s of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.<ref name=\"Falkowoski08\"/>\n\nThe ecology of global carbon budgets gives one example of the linkage between biodiversity and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year.<ref name=\"Grace04\"/> There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic [[outgassing]], the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500&nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]].<ref name=\"Pearson00\"/>\n\nIn the [[Oligocene]], from twenty-five to thirty-two million years ago, there was another significant restructuring of the global [[carbon cycle]] as grasses evolved a new mechanism of photosynthesis, [[C4 carbon fixation|C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis]], and expanded their ranges. This new pathway evolved in response to the drop in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 550 ppm.<ref name=\"Pagani05\"/> The relative abundance and distribution of biodiversity alters the dynamics between organisms and their environment such that ecosystems can be both cause and effect in relation to climate change. Human-driven modifications to the planet's ecosystems (e.g., disturbance, [[biodiversity loss]], agriculture) contributes to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas levels. Transformation of the global carbon cycle in the next century is projected to raise planetary temperatures, lead to more extreme fluctuations in weather, alter species distributions, and increase extinction rates. The effect of global warming is already being registered in melting glaciers, melting mountain ice caps, and rising sea levels. Consequently, species distributions are changing along waterfronts and in continental areas where migration patterns and breeding grounds are tracking the prevailing shifts in climate. Large sections of [[permafrost]] are also melting to create a new mosaic of flooded areas having increased rates of soil decomposition activity that raises methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) emissions. There is concern over increases in atmospheric methane in the context of the global carbon cycle, because methane is a [[greenhouse gas]] that is 23 times more effective at absorbing long-wave radiation than CO<sub>2</sub> on a 100-year time scale.<ref name=\"Zhuan07\"/> Hence, there is a relationship between global warming, decomposition and respiration in soils and wetlands producing significant climate feedbacks and globally altered biogeochemical cycles.<ref name=\"Liu09\"/><ref name=\"Cox00\"/><ref name=\"Erwin09\">{{cite journal | last1=Erwin | first1=D.

For duple dances, that is every other couple, and for triple dances, every third couple is the active couple.  The term is applicable to triplet dances, where typically the active couple is the only couple that is active. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, only the active couple\u2014the \"1st couple\"\u2014initiated the action, other couples supporting their movements and joining in as needed, until they also took their turn as leading couples.\n\n'''Arm right (or left)''' - couples link right (or left) arms and move forward in a circle, returning to their starting positions.\n\n'''Back to back''' - facing another person, move forward ''passing'' right shoulders and ''fall back'' to place passing left. May also start by passing left and falling back right. Called a [[dosado|do si do]] in other dance forms (and ''dos-\u00e0-dos'' in France).\n\n'''Balance back''' - a ''single'' backward.\n\n'''Both hands''' - two dancers face each other and give hands right to left and left to right.\n\n'''Cast''' - turn outward and dance up or down outside the set, as directed.  The instruction \"cast off\" is frequently synonymous with \"cast down\".\n\n'''Changes (starting right or left)''' - like the ''circular hey'', but dancers give hands as they pass (handing hey). The number of changes is given first (e.g. two changes, three changes, etc.).\n\n'''[[Chasse|Chass\u00e9]]''' - slipping step to right or left as directed.\n\n'''Circular hey''' - dancers face partners or along the line and ''pass'' right and left alternating a stated number of changes. Usually done without hands, the circular hey may also be done by more than two couples facing alternately and moving in opposite directions - usually to their original places. This name for the figure was invented by Cecil Sharp and does not appear in sources pre-1900.Nonetheless, some early country dances calling for heys have been interpreted in modern times using circular heys. In early dances, where the hey is called a \"double hey\", it works to interpret this as an oval hey, like the modern circular hey but adapted to the straight sides of a longways formation.\n\n'''Clockwise''' - in a ring, move to one's left. In a ''turn single'' turn to the right.\n\n'''Contrary''' - your contrary is not your partner. In Playford's original notation, this term meant the same thing that ''Corner'' (or sometimes ''Opposite'') means today.\n\n'''Corner''' - in a two-couple set, the dancer diagonally opposite, i.e., the first man and the second woman, first woman and second man.\n\n'''Counter-clockwise''' - the opposite of clockwise - in a ring, move right. In a ''turn single'', turn to the left.\n\n'''Cross hands''' - face and give left to left and right to right.\n\n'''Cross over or Pass''' - change places with another dancer moving forward and passing by the right shoulder, unless otherwise directed.\n\n'''Cross and go below''' - cross as above and go outside below one couple, ending improper.\n\n'''Double''' - four steps forward or back, closing the feet on the 4th step (see \"Single\" below).\n\n'''Fall (back)''' - dance backwards.\n\n'''Figure of 8''' - a weaving figure in which dancers pass between two standing people and move around them in a figure 8 pattern. A '''Full Figure of 8''' returns the dancer to original position; a '''Half Figure of 8''' leaves the dancer on the opposite side of the set from original position. In doing this figure, the man lets his partner pass in front of him in some communities; others prefer the rule of \"the dancer coming from the left-hand side has right of way\".  A double figure of 8 involves four dancers tracing a whole figure of eight around the (now unoccupied) positions of the other couple; half the dancers typically start going around the outside first.\n\n'''Forward''' - ''lead'' or move in the direction you are facing.\n\n'''Gypsy''' - two dancers move around each other in a circular path while facing each other.\n\n'''Hands across''' - right or left hands are given to ''corners'', and dancers move in the direction they face.\n\n'''Hands three, four etc.'''. - the designated number of dancers form a ring and move around in the direction indicated, usually first to the left and back to the right.\n\n'''Hey''' - a weaving figure in which two groups of dancers move in single file and in opposite directions (see ''circular hey'' and ''straight hey'').\n\n'''Honour''' - couples step forward and right, close, shift weight, and [[curtsey]] or [[Bowing (social)|bow]], then repeat to their left. In the time of Playford's original manual, a woman's curtsey was similar to the modern one, but a man's honour (or reverence) kept the upper body upright and involved sliding the left leg forward while bending the right knee <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://round.soc.srcf.net/round/dances/elements#0.2.GSUMN2.2PL4XM.F4SFGD.Y|title=Elements of English Country Dance {{!}} The Round|website=round.soc.srcf.net|access-date=2016-09-21}}</ref>\n\n'''Lead''' - couples join inside hands and walk up or down the set.\n\n'''\"Mad Robin\" figure''' - a [[Dosado|back to back]] with your neighbor while maintaining eye-contact with your partner across the set. Men take one step forward and then slide to the right passing in front of their neighbour, then step backwards and slide left behind their neighbour. Conversely women take one step backwards and then slide to the left passing behind of their neighbour, then step forwards and slide right in front of their neighbour. In some versions, the dancer who is going outside the set at the moment casts out to begin that motion. The term ''Mad Robin'' comes from the name of a dance which has the move and was adopted into contra dancing (as a move for all four dancers, unlike the original English dance, where only one couple does it a time) before being readmitted as an all-four figure into English in modern dances.\n\n'''Neighbour''' - the person you are standing beside, but not your partner.\n\n'''Opposite''' - the person you are facing.\n\n'''Poussette''' - two dancers face, give both hands and change places as a couple with two adjacent dancers. One pair moves a ''double'' toward one wall, the other toward the other wall. In this half-poussette, couples pass around each other diagonally. To complete the poussette, move in the opposite direction. Dancers end in their original places. In a similar movement, the '''Draw Poussette''', the dancing pairs move on a U-shaped track with one dancer of the pair always moving forwards.\n\n'''Proper''' - with the man on the left and the woman on the right, from the perspective of someone facing the music. '''Improper''' is the opposite.\n\n'''Right & left''' - like the ''circular hey'', but dancers give hands as they pass (handing hey).\n\n'''Set''' - a dancer steps right, closes with left foot and shifts weight to it, then steps back to the right foot (right-together-step); then repeats the process mirror-image (left-together-step). In some areas it is done starting to the left. It may be done in place or advancing. Often followed by a turn single.\n\n'''Siding''' - two dancers, partners by default if not otherwise specified, go forward in four counts to meet side by side, then back in four counts to where they started the figure. As depicted by Feuillet, this is done right side by right side the first time, left by left the second time.\n\n'''Single''' - two steps in any direction closing feet on the second step (the second step tends to be interpreted as a closing action in which weight usually stays on the same foot as before, consistent with descriptions from Renaissance sources).\n\n'''Slipping circle (left or right)''' - dancers take hands in a circle (facing in) and chass\u00e9 left or right.\n\n'''Hands across''' or '''Star''' - some number of dancers (usually four) join right or left hands in the middle of their circle (facing either CW or CCW). The dancers circle in the direction they face.\n\n'''Straight hey for four''' - dancers face alternately, the two in the middle facing out. Dancers pass right shoulders on either end and weave to the end opposite. If the last pass at the end is by the right. the dancer turns right and reenters the line by the same shoulder; vice versa if the last pass was to the left. Dancers end in their original places.\n\n'''Straight hey for three''' - the first dancer faces the other two and ''passes'' right shoulders with the second dancer, left shoulder with the third - the other dancers moving and passing the indicated shoulder. On making the last pass, each dancer makes a whole turn on the end, bearing right if the last pass was by the right shoulder or left if last pass was by the left, and reenters the figure returning to place. Each dancer describes a figure of eight pattern.\n\n'''Swing''' - a ''turn'' with two hands, but moving faster and making more than one revolution.\n\n'''Turn''' - face, give ''both hands'', and make a complete circular, clockwise turn to place.\n\n'''Turn by right or left''' - dancers join right (or left) hands and turn around, separate, and ''fall'' to places.\n\n'''Turn single''' - dancers turn around in four steps. 'Turn single right shoulder' is a clockwise turn; 'turn single left shoulder' is a counterclockwise turn.\n\n'''Up a double and back''' - common combination in which dancers (usually having linked hands in a line) advance a double and then retire another double.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:English country dance]]\n[[Category:Glossaries of dance]]", "sha1": "qvhhw4dvr9fh9c2fv4qvxydpzw72x06"}}, {"title": "Ecosystem", "ns": "0", "id": "9632", "revision": {"id": "862416510", "parentid": "861374147", "timestamp": "2018-10-04T07:10:57Z", "contributor": {"username": "Pbsouthwood", "id": "10044298"}, "comment": "Changing [[Wikipedia:Short description|short description]] from \"community of living organisms together with the nonliving components of their environment\" to \"A community of living organisms together with the nonliving components of their environment\" ([[User:Galobtter/Shortdesc helper|Shortdesc helper]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-vandalism|small=yes}}\n{{short description|A community of living organisms together with the nonliving components of their environment}}\n{{about|natural ecosystems|the term used in man-made systems|Digital ecosystem}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | background color = white\n | image1 = Blue Linckia Starfish.JPG\n | width1 = 180\n | alt1 = [[Coral reef]]s are a highly [[Productivity (ecology)|productive]] [[marine ecosystem]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hatcher|first=Bruce Gordon|year=1990|title=Coral reef primary productivity.

Aquatic ecosystems are split into [[marine ecosystem]]s and [[freshwater ecosystem]]s.\n\n==Processes==\n[[File:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|thumb|[[Rainforest]] ecosystems are rich in [[biodiversity]]. This is the [[Gambia River]] in [[Senegal]]'s [[Niokolo-Koba National Park]].]]\n[[File:Baja California Desert.jpg|thumb|[[Flora]] of [[Baja California Desert]], [[Catavi\u00f1a]] region, [[Mexico]]]]\n[[File:Vegetation.png|thumb|right|Biomes of the world]]\n\n=== External and internal factors ===\nEcosystems are controlled both by external and internal factors. External factors, also called state factors, control the overall structure of an ecosystem and the way things work within it, but are not themselves influenced by the ecosystem. The most important of these is [[climate]].<ref name=\"Chapin11\"/> Climate determines the [[biome]] in which the ecosystem is embedded. Rainfall patterns and seasonal temperatures influence photosynthesis and thereby determine the amount of water and energy available to the ecosystem.<ref name = \"Chapin11\"/> \n\n[[Parent material]] determines the nature of the soil in an ecosystem, and influences the supply of mineral nutrients. [[Topography]] also controls ecosystem processes by affecting things like [[microclimate]], soil development and the movement of water through a system. For example, ecosystems can be quite different if situated in a small depression on the landscape, versus one present on an adjacent steep hillside.<ref name=\"Chapin11\" />\n\nOther external factors that play an important role in ecosystem functioning include time and potential [[biota (ecology)|biota]]. Similarly, the set of organisms that can potentially be present in an area can also significantly affect ecosystems. Ecosystems in similar environments that are located in different parts of the world can end up doing things very differently simply because they have different pools of species present.<ref name=\"Chapin11\" /> The [[introduced species|introduction of non-native species]] can cause substantial shifts in ecosystem function.\n\nUnlike external factors, internal factors in ecosystems not only control ecosystem processes but are also controlled by them. Consequently, they are often subject to [[feedback|feedback loops]].<ref name = \"Chapin11\"/> While the [[Resource (biology)|resource]] inputs are generally controlled by external processes like climate and parent material, the availability of these resources within the ecosystem is controlled by internal factors like decomposition, root competition or shading.<ref name = \"Chapin11\"/> Other factors like disturbance, succession or the types of species present are also internal factors. \n\n===Primary production===\n[[File:Seawifs global biosphere.jpg|upright=1.8|thumb|Global oceanic and terrestrial [[phototroph]] abundance, from September 1997 to August 2000. As an estimate of [[autotroph]] biomass, it is only a rough indicator of primary production potential and not an actual estimate of it.]]\n{{main article|Primary production}}\nPrimary production is the production of [[organic matter]] from inorganic carbon sources. This mainly occurs through [[photosynthesis]]. The energy incorporated through this process supports life on earth, while the carbon makes up much of the organic matter in living and dead biomass, [[soil carbon]] and [[fossil fuel]]s. It also drives the [[carbon cycle]], which influences global [[climate]] via the [[greenhouse effect]].\n\nThrough the process of photosynthesis, plants capture energy from light and use it to combine [[carbon dioxide]] and water to produce [[carbohydrate]]s and [[oxygen]]. The photosynthesis carried out by all the plants in an ecosystem is called the gross primary production (GPP).<ref name = \"Chapin97\">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 97\u2013104</ref> About 48\u201360% of the GPP is consumed in plant respiration. \n\nThe remainder, that portion of GPP that is not used up by respiration, is known as the [[net primary production]] (NPP).<ref name=\"Chapin123\">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 123\u2013150</ref> \n\n===Energy flow===\n\n{{main article|Energy flow (ecology)}}\n{{See also|Food web|Trophic level}}\n[[Energy]] and [[carbon]] enter ecosystems through [[photosynthesis]], are incorporated into living tissue, transferred to other organisms that feed on the living and dead plant matter, and eventually released through respiration.<ref name=\"Chapin123\" />\n\nThe carbon and energy incorporated into plant tissues (net primary production) is either consumed by animals while the plant is alive, or it remains uneaten when the plant tissue dies and becomes [[detritus]]. In [[terrestrial ecosystem]]s, roughly 90% of the net primary production ends up being broken down by [[decomposition|decomposers]]. The remainder is either consumed by animals while still alive and enters the plant-based trophic system, or it is consumed after it has died, and enters the detritus-based trophic system. \n\nIn [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic systems]], the proportion of plant biomass that gets consumed by [[herbivore]]s is much higher.<ref name=\"Chapin244\">Chapin ''et al''. (2002) pp. 244\u2013264</ref>\nIn trophic systems photosynthetic organisms are the primary producers. The organisms that consume their tissues are called primary consumers or [[secondary production|secondary producers]]\u2014[[herbivores]]. Organisms which feed on [[microbe]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]) are termed [[microbivore]]s. Animals that feed on primary consumers\u2014[[carnivore]]s\u2014are secondary consumers. Each of these constitutes a [[trophic level]].<ref name=\"Chapin244\" /> \n\nThe sequence of consumption\u2014from plant to herbivore, to carnivore\u2014forms a [[food chain]]. Real systems are much more complex than this\u2014organisms will generally feed on more than one form of food, and may feed at more than one trophic level. Carnivores may capture some prey which are part of a plant-based trophic system and others that are part of a detritus-based trophic system (a bird that feeds both on herbivorous grasshoppers and earthworms, which consume detritus). Real systems, with all these complexities, form [[food web]]s rather than food chains.<ref name=\"Chapin244\" />\n\n====Ecosystem ecology====\n{{Main article|Ecosystem ecology}}\n{{See also|Ecosystem model}}\n[[File:East Scotia Ridge - Plos Biol 04.tif|thumb|right|A [[hydrothermal vent]] is an ecosystem on the ocean floor. (The scale bar is 1 m.)]]\nEcosystem ecology studies \"the flow of energy and materials through organisms and the physical environment\". It seeks to understand the processes which govern the stocks of material and energy in ecosystems, and the flow of matter and energy through them. The study of ecosystems can cover 10 [[order of magnitude|orders of magnitude]], from the surface layers of rocks to the surface of the planet.<ref>Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 3\u20137</ref>\n\n===Decomposition===\n{{See also|Decomposition}}\nThe carbon and nutrients in [[soil organic matter|dead organic matter]] are broken down by a group of processes known as [[decomposition]]. This releases nutrients that can then be re-used for plant and microbial production and returns carbon dioxide to the atmosphere (or water) where it can be used for [[photosynthesis]]. In the absence of decomposition, the dead organic matter would accumulate in an ecosystem, and nutrients and atmospheric carbon dioxide would be depleted.<ref name= Chapin151>Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 151\u2013157</ref> Approximately 90% of terrestrial net primary production goes directly from plant to decomposer.<ref name = \"Chapin244\"/>\n\nDecomposition processes can be separated into three categories\u2014[[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], fragmentation and chemical alteration of dead material. \n\n==== Leaching ====\nAs water moves through dead organic matter, it dissolves and carries with it the water-soluble components. These are then taken up by organisms in the soil, react with mineral soil, or are transported beyond the confines of the ecosystem (and are considered lost to it).<ref name=\"Chapin151\" /> Newly shed leaves and newly dead animals have high concentrations of water-soluble components and include [[sugar]]s, [[amino acid]]s and mineral nutrients. Leaching is more important in wet environments and much less important in dry ones.<ref name=\"Chapin151\" />\n\n==== Fragmentation ====\nFragmentation processes break organic material into smaller pieces, exposing new surfaces for colonization by microbes. Freshly shed [[leaf litter]] may be inaccessible due to an outer layer of [[plant cuticle|cuticle]] or [[Bark (botany)|bark]], and [[protoplasm|cell contents]] are protected by a [[cell wall]]. Newly dead animals may be covered by an [[exoskeleton]]. Fragmentation processes, which break through these protective layers, accelerate the rate of microbial decomposition.<ref name= Chapin151/> Animals fragment detritus as they hunt for food, as does passage through the gut. [[Freeze-thaw cycle]]s and cycles of wetting and drying also fragment dead material.<ref name= Chapin151/>\n\n==== Chemical alteration ====\nThe chemical alteration of the dead organic matter is primarily achieved through bacterial and fungal action. Fungal [[hypha]]e produce enzymes which can break through the tough outer structures surrounding dead plant material. They also produce enzymes which break down [[lignin]], which allows them access to both cell contents and to the nitrogen in the lignin. Fungi can transfer carbon and nitrogen through their hyphal networks and thus, unlike bacteria, are not dependent solely on locally available resources.<ref name = \"Chapin151\"/>\n\n==== Decomposition rates ====\n{{Further|Decomposition#Rate of decomposition}}\nDecomposition rates vary among ecosystems. The rate of decomposition is governed by three sets of factors\u2014the physical environment (temperature, moisture, and soil properties), the quantity and quality of the dead material available to decomposers, and the nature of the microbial community itself.<ref name = \"Chapin159\">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 159\u2013174</ref> Temperature controls the rate of microbial respiration; the higher the temperature, the faster microbial decomposition occurs. It also affects soil moisture, which slows microbial growth and reduces leaching. Freeze-thaw cycles also affect decomposition\u2014freezing temperatures kill soil microorganisms, which allows leaching to play a more important role in moving nutrients around. This can be especially important as the soil thaws in the spring, creating a pulse of nutrients which become available.<ref name = \"Chapin159\"/>\n\nDecomposition rates are low under very wet or very dry conditions. Decomposition rates are highest in wet, moist conditions with adequate levels of oxygen. Wet soils tend to become deficient in oxygen (this is especially true in [[wetland]]s), which slows microbial growth. In dry soils, decomposition slows as well, but bacteria continue to grow (albeit at a slower rate) even after soils become too dry to support plant growth.\n\n===Nutrient cycling===\n{{See also|Nutrient cycle|Biogeochemical cycle}}\n[[File:Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|Biological nitrogen cycling]]\nEcosystems continually exchange energy and carbon with the wider [[environment (systems)|environment]]. Mineral nutrients, on the other hand, are mostly cycled back and forth between plants, animals, microbes and the soil. Most nitrogen enters ecosystems through biological [[nitrogen fixation]], is deposited through precipitation, dust, gases or is applied as [[fertilizer]].<ref name=\"Chapin197\">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), pp. 197\u2013215</ref> \n\n==== Nitrogen cycle ====\n{{Main|Nitrogen cycle}}\n\nSince most [[terrestrial ecosystems]] are nitrogen-limited, [[Nitrogen cycle|nitrogen cycling]] is an important control on ecosystem production.<ref name=\"Chapin197\" />\n\nUntil modern times, nitrogen fixation was the major source of nitrogen for ecosystems. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria either live [[symbiosis|symbiotically]] with plants or live freely in the soil. The energetic cost is high for plants which support nitrogen-fixing symbionts\u2014as much as 25% of gross primary production when measured in controlled conditions. Many members of the [[legume]] plant family support nitrogen-fixing symbionts. Some [[cyanobacteria]] are also capable of nitrogen fixation. These are [[phototroph]]s, which carry out photosynthesis. Like other nitrogen-fixing bacteria, they can either be free-living or have symbiotic relationships with plants.<ref name = \"Chapin197\"/> Other sources of nitrogen include [[acid deposition]] produced through the combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[ammonia]] gas which evaporates from agricultural fields which have had fertilizers applied to them, and dust.<ref name = \"Chapin197\"/> Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs account for about 80% of all nitrogen fluxes in ecosystems.<ref name = \"Chapin197\"/>\n\nWhen plant tissues are shed or are eaten, the nitrogen in those tissues becomes available to animals and microbes. Microbial decomposition releases nitrogen compounds from dead organic matter in the soil, where plants, fungi, and bacteria compete for it. Some soil bacteria use organic nitrogen-containing compounds as a source of carbon, and release [[ammonium]] ions into the soil. This process is known as [[ammonification|nitrogen mineralization]]. Others convert ammonium to [[nitrite]] and [[nitrate]] ions, a process known as [[nitrification]].

Ecologically distinct species, on the other hand, have a much larger effect. Similarly, dominant species have a large effect on ecosystem function, while rare species tend to have a small effect. [[Keystone species]] tend to have an effect on ecosystem function that is disproportionate to their abundance in an ecosystem.<ref name=\"Chapin265\" /> Similarly, an [[ecosystem engineer]] is any [[organism]] that creates, significantly modifies, maintains or destroys a [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]].\n\n===Dynamics===\n\nEcosystems are dynamic entities. They are subject to periodic disturbances and are in the process of recovering from some past disturbance.<ref name=\"Chapin281\">{{cite book|title=Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology|last=Chapin|first=F. Stuart|author2=Pamela A. Matson|author3=Harold A. Mooney|publisher=Springer|year=2002|isbn=0-387-95443-0|location=New York|pages=281\u2013304}}</ref> When a [[perturbation (biology)|perturbation]] occurs, an ecoystem responds by moving away from its initial state. The tendency of an ecosystem to remain close to its equilibrium state, despite that disturbance, is termed its [[resistance (ecology)|resistance]]. On the other hand, the speed with which it returns to its initial state after disturbance is called its [[resilience (ecology)|resilience]].<ref name = \"Chapin281\"/> Time plays a role in the development of soil from bare rock and the [[ecological succession|recovery of a community from disturbance]].<ref name=\"Chapin11\" />\n\nFrom one year to another, ecosystems experience variation in their biotic and abiotic environments. A drought, an especially cold winter and a pest outbreak all constitute short-term variability in environmental conditions. Animal populations vary from year to year, building up during resource-rich periods and crashing as they overshoot their food supply. These changes play out in changes in [[net primary production]] [[decomposition]] rates, and other ecosystem processes.<ref name = \"Chapin281\"/> Longer-term changes also shape ecosystem processes\u2014the forests of eastern North America still show legacies of cultivation which ceased 200 years ago, while [[methane]] production in eastern [[Siberia|Siberian]] lakes is controlled by organic matter which accumulated during the [[Pleistocene]].<ref name = \"Chapin281\"/>\n\n[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]] also plays an important role in ecological processes. [[F. Stuart Chapin III|F. Stuart Chapin]] and coauthors define disturbance as \"a relatively discrete event in time and space that alters the structure of populations, communities, and ecosystems and causes changes in resources availability or the physical environment\".<ref name = \"Chapin 285\">Chapin ''et al''. (2002), p. 285</ref> This can range from tree falls and insect outbreaks to hurricanes and wildfires to volcanic eruptions. Such disturbances can cause large changes in plant, animal and microbe populations, as well soil organic matter content.<ref name = \"Chapin281\"/> Disturbance is followed by [[ecological succession|succession]], a \"directional change in ecosystem structure and functioning resulting from biotically driven changes in resources supply.\"<ref name = \"Chapin 285\"/>\n\nThe frequency and severity of disturbance determine the way it affects ecosystem function. A major disturbance like a volcanic eruption or [[Glacier|glacial]] advance and retreat leave behind soils that lack plants, animals or organic matter. Ecosystems that experience such disturbances undergo [[primary succession]]. A less severe disturbance like forest fires, hurricanes or cultivation result in [[secondary succession]] and a faster recovery.<ref name = \"Chapin281\"/> More severe disturbance and more frequent disturbance result in longer recovery times. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Panorama presa las ni\u00f1as mogan gran canaria.jpg|thumb|upright=4.1|center|<center>A [[freshwater]] ecosystem in [[Gran Canaria]], an [[island]] of the [[Canary Islands]]</center>]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Classification methods==\n{{See also|Ecosystem diversity|Ecoregion|Ecological land classification|Ecotope}}\n\nClassifying ecosystems into ecologically homogeneous units is an important step towards effective ecosystem management.<ref name=\"Lugo1999\">{{cite journal|last=Lugo|first=A.

If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value of the account at year-end will be $2.00. What happens if the interest is computed and credited more frequently during the year?\n\nIf the interest is credited twice in the year, the interest rate for each 6 months will be 50%, so the initial $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 1.5<sup>2</sup> = $2.25}} at the end of the year. Compounding quarterly yields {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 1.25<sup>4</sup> = $2.4414...}}, and compounding monthly yields {{nowrap|1=$1.00 \u00d7 (1 + 1/12)<sup>12</sup> = $2.613035...}} If there are {{math|''n''}} compounding intervals, the interest for each interval will be {{math|100%/''n''}} and the value at the end of the year will be $1.00\u00d7{{math|1=(1 + 1/''n'')<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nBernoulli noticed that this sequence approaches a limit (the [[force of interest]]) with larger {{math|''n''}} and, thus, smaller compounding intervals. Compounding weekly ({{math|1=''n'' = 52}}) yields $2.692597..., while compounding daily ({{math|1=''n'' = 365}}) yields $2.714567..., just two cents more. The limit as {{math|''n''}} grows large is the number that came to be known as {{mvar|e}}; with ''continuous'' compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818... \n\nMore generally, an account that starts at $1 and offers an annual interest rate of {{math|''R''}} will, after {{math|''t''}} years, yield {{math|''e''<sup>''Rt''</sup>}} dollars with continuous compounding. (Here {{math|''R''}} is the decimal equivalent of the rate of interest expressed as a percentage, so for 5% interest, {{math|1=''R'' = 5/100 = 0.05}}.)\n\n===Bernoulli trials===\n[[File:Bernoulli_trial_sequence.svg|thumb|300px|Graphs of probability ''P'' of '''not''' observing independent events each of probability 1/''n'' after ''n'' Bernoulli trials, and 1 - ''P''&thinsp; vs ''n''&thinsp;; it can be observed that as ''n'' increases, the probability of a 1/''n''-chance event never appearing after ''n'' tries rapidly converges to 1/''e''.]]\nThe number {{mvar|e}} itself also has applications to [[probability theory]], where it arises in a way not obviously related to exponential growth. Suppose that a gambler plays a slot machine that pays out with a probability of one in {{math|''n''}} and plays it {{math|''n''}} times. Then, for large {{math|''n''}} (such as a million) the [[probability]] that the gambler will lose every bet is approximately {{math|1/''e''}}. For {{math|1=''n'' = 20}} it is already approximately 1/2.79.\n\nThis is an example of a [[Bernoulli trial]] process. Each time the gambler plays the slots, there is a one in one million chance of winning. Playing one million times is modelled by the [[binomial distribution]], which is closely related to the [[binomial theorem]]. The probability of winning {{math|''k''}} times out of a million trials is:\n:<math>\\binom{10^6}{k} \\left(10^{-6}\\right)^k(1-10^{-6})^{10^6-k}.</math>\nIn particular, the probability of winning zero times ({{math|1=''k'' = 0}}) is\n:<math>\\left(1-\\frac{1}{10^6}\\right)^{10^6}.</math>\nThis is very close to the limit\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\left(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\right)^n = \\frac{1}{e}.</math>\n\n===Derangements===\n{{main|Derangement}}\nAnother application of {{mvar|e}}, also discovered in part by Jacob Bernoulli along with [[Pierre Raymond de Montmort]], is in the problem of [[derangement]]s, also known as the ''hat check problem'':<ref>Grinstead, C.M. and Snell, J.L.''[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~chance/teaching_aids/books_articles/probability_book/book.html Introduction to probability theory]'' (published online under the [[GFDL]]), p.&nbsp;85.</ref> {{math|''n''}} guests are invited to a party, and at the door each guest checks his hat with the butler who then places them into {{math|''n''}} boxes, each labelled with the name of one guest. But the butler does not know the identities of the guests, and so he puts the hats into boxes selected at random. The problem of de Montmort is to find the probability that ''none'' of the hats gets put into the right box. The answer is:\n\n:<math>p_n = 1-\\frac{1}{1!}+\\frac{1}{2!}-\\frac{1}{3!}+\\cdots+\\frac{(-1)^n}{n!} = \\sum_{k = 0}^n \\frac{(-1)^k}{k!}.</math>\n\nAs the number {{math|''n''}} of guests tends to infinity, {{math|''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}} approaches {{math|1/''e''}}. Furthermore, the number of ways the hats can be placed into the boxes so that none of the hats are in the right box is {{math|''n''!/''e''}} rounded to the nearest integer, for every positive&nbsp;{{math|''n''}}.<ref>Knuth (1997) ''[[The Art of Computer Programming]]'' Volume I, Addison-Wesley, p.&nbsp;183 {{isbn|0-201-03801-3}}.</ref>\n\n===Optimal planning problems===\nA stick of length {{mvar|L}} is broken into {{mvar|n}} equal parts.

The quantity <math>x^{-1}\\ln x</math> is a measure of [[Shannon information|information]] gleaned from an event occurring with probability <math>1/x </math>, so that essentially the same optimal division appears in optimal planning problems like the [[secretary problem]].\n\n===Asymptotics===\nThe number {{mvar|e}} occurs naturally in connection with many problems involving [[asymptotics]]. An example is [[Stirling's formula]] for the [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotics]] of the [[factorial function]], in which both the numbers {{mvar|e}} and [[Pi|{{pi}}]] enter:\n:<math>n! \\sim \\sqrt{2\\pi n}\\, \\left(\\frac{n}{e}\\right)^n.</math>\nAs a consequence,\n:<math>e = \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{n}{\\sqrt[n]{n!}} .</math>\n\n===Standard normal distribution===\n{{main article|Normal distribution}}\n\nThe normal distribution with zero mean and unit standard deviation is known as the ''standard normal distribution'', given by the [[probability density function]]\n\n:<math>\\phi(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\, e^{- \\frac{\\scriptscriptstyle 1}{\\scriptscriptstyle 2} x^2}.</math>\n\nThe constraint of unit variance (and thus also unit standard deviation) results in the {{frac2|1|2}} in the exponent, and the constraint of unit total area under the curve {{math|''\u03d5''(''x'')}} results in the factor <math>\\textstyle 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</math>.<sup>[[Gaussian integral|[proof]]]</sup>  This function is symmetric around {{math|1=''x'' = 0}}, where it attains its maximum value <math>\\textstyle 1/\\sqrt{2\\pi}</math>, and has [[inflection point]]s at {{math|1=''x'' = \u00b11}}.\n\n==In calculus==\n\n[[Image:Exp derivative at 0.svg|thumb|right|frame|The functions <math>x \\mapsto a^x</math> are shown for <math>a = 2</math> (dotted), <math>a= e</math> (blue), and <math>a = 4</math> (dashed).

(1998) ''Calculus: An intuitive and physical approach'', section 12.3 [https://books.google.com/books?id=YdjK_rD7BEkC&pg=PA337 \"The Derived Functions of Logarithmic Functions.\"], pp. 337 ff, Courier Dover Publications, 1998, {{isbn|0-486-40453-6}}</ref> A general exponential {{nowrap|function {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}}}} has a derivative, given by a [[limit of a function|limit]]:\n\n:<math display=\"inline\">\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dx}a^x &=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^{x+h}-a^x}{h}=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^{x}a^{h}-a^x}{h} \\\\\n&=a^x\\cdot \\left(\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{a^h-1}{h}\\right).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe parenthesized limit on the right is independent of the {{nowrap|variable {{math|''x''}}:}} it depends only on the {{nowrap|base {{math|''a''}}.}} When the base is set {{nowrap|to {{mvar|e}},}} this limit is equal {{nowrap|to {{math|1}},}} and so {{mvar|e}} is symbolically defined by the equation:\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x.</math>\n\nConsequently, the exponential function with base {{mvar|e}} is particularly suited to doing calculus. {{nowrap|Choosing {{mvar|e}},}} as opposed to some other number, as the base of the exponential function makes calculations involving the derivative much simpler.\n\nAnother motivation comes from considering the derivative of the base-{{math|''a''}} [[logarithm]],<ref>This is the approach taken by Kline (1998).</ref> i.e., of {{math|log<sub>''a''</sub> ''x''}} for&nbsp;{{math|x > 0}}:\n\n:<math display=\"inline\">\\begin{align}\n\\frac{d}{dx}\\log_a x &= \\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\log_a(x+h)-\\log_a(x)}{h} \\\\\n&=\\lim_{h\\to 0}\\frac{\\log_a(1+h/x)}{x\\cdot h/x} \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{x}\\log_a\\left(\\lim_{u\\to 0}(1+u)^{1/u}\\right) \\\\\n&=\\frac{1}{x}\\log_a e,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nwhere the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''h''/''x''}} was made. The {{mvar|a}}-logarithm of {{mvar|e}} is 1, if {{mvar|a}} equals {{mvar|e}}. So symbolically,\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx}\\log_e x=\\frac{1}{x}.</math>\nThe logarithm with this special base is called the [[natural logarithm]] and is denoted as {{math|ln}}; it behaves well under differentiation since there is no undetermined limit to carry through the calculations.\n\nThere are thus two ways in which to select such special numbers {{mvar|a}}. One way is to set the derivative of the exponential function {{math|''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}} equal to {{math|''a''<sup>''x''</sup>}}, and solve for {{math|''a''}}. The other way is to set the derivative of the base {{math|''a''}} logarithm to {{math|1/''x''}} and solve for {{math|''a''}}. In each case, one arrives at a convenient choice of base for doing calculus. It turns out that these two solutions for {{mvar|a}} are actually ''the same'', the number {{mvar|e}}.\n\n===Alternative characterizations===\n[[File:Part38figure02.gif|thumb|right|The five shaded regions are of equal area, and define units of [[hyperbolic angle]] along the [[hyperbola]] <math>xy=1</math>.]]\n{{See also|#Representations|Characterizations of the exponential function}}\n\nOther characterizations of {{mvar|e}} are also possible: one is as the [[limit of a sequence]], another is as the sum of an [[infinite series]], and still others rely on [[integral calculus]].

It explains the superior performance of the [[trapezoidal rule]] on smooth [[periodic function]]s and is used in certain [[Series acceleration|extrapolation methods]]. [[Clenshaw\u2013Curtis quadrature]] is essentially a change of variables to cast an arbitrary integral in terms of integrals of periodic functions where the Euler\u2013Maclaurin approach is very accurate (in that particular case the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula takes the form of a [[discrete cosine transform]]). This technique is known as a periodizing transformation.\n\n===Asymptotic expansion of sums===\nIn the context of computing [[asymptotic expansion]]s of sums and [[Series (mathematics)|series]], usually the most useful form of the Euler\u2013Maclaurin formula is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=a}^b f(n) \\sim \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx + \\frac{f(b) + f(a)}{2} + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\,\\frac{B_{2k}}{(2k)!} (f^{(2k - 1)}(b) - f^{(2k - 1)}(a))</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are integers.<ref>{{harvtxt|Abramowitz|Stegun|1972}}, 23.1.30</ref> Often the expansion remains valid even after taking the limits <math>a\\rightarrow-\\infty</math> or <math>b\\rightarrow +\\infty</math> or both.  In many cases the integral on the right-hand side can be evaluated in [[Differential Galois theory|closed form]] in terms of [[elementary function]]s even though the sum on the left-hand side cannot.

But if he be a liar, what he says is untrue, and consequently the Cretans are veracious; but Epimenides is a Cretan, and therefore what he says is true; saying the Cretans are liars, Epimenides is himself a liar, and what he says is untrue. Thus we may go on alternately proving that Epimenides and the Cretans are truthful and untruthful.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Elements of Deductive Logic |last= Fowler |first=Thomas |authorlink=Thomas Fowler (university administrator) |year=1869 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |edition=3rd |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSYCAAAAQAAJ&dq=epimenides&pg=PA163#v=onepage&q=epimenides&f=false |accessdate=1 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Epimenides paradox in this form, however, can be solved. There are two options: it is either true or false. First, assume that it is true, but then Epimenides, being a Cretan, would be a liar, and making the assumption that liars only make false statements, the statement is false. So, assuming the statement is true leads us to conclude that the statement is false. This is a contradiction, so the option of the statement being true is not possible. This leaves the second option: that it is false.\n\nIf we assume the statement is false and that Epimenides is lying about all Cretans being liars, then there must exist at least one Cretan who is honest. This does not lead to contradiction since it is not required that this Cretan be Epimenides. This means that Epimenides can say the false statement that all Cretans are liars while knowing at least one honest Cretan and lying about this particular Cretan. Hence, from the assumption that the statement is false, it does not follow that the statement is true. So we can avoid a paradox as seeing the statement \"all Cretans are liars\" as a false statement, which is made by a lying Cretan, Epimenides.<ref>[[Liar paradox#History]]</ref><ref>http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EpimenidesParadox.html</ref> The mistake made by Thomas Fowler (and many other people) above is to think that the negation of \"all Cretans are liars\" is \"all Cretans are honest\" (a paradox) when in fact the negation is \"there exists a Cretan who is honest\", or \"not all Cretans are liars\". The Epimenides paradox can be slightly modified as to not allow the kind of solution described above, as it was in the [[Eubulides#Paradoxes of Eubulides|first paradox of Eubulides]] but instead leading to a non-avoidable self-contradiction. Paradoxical versions of the Epimenides problem are closely related to a class of more difficult logical problems, including the [[liar paradox]], [[Socratic paradox]], and the [[Burali-Forti paradox]], all of which have self-reference in common with Epimenides. Indeed, the Epimenides paradox is usually classified as a variation on the liar paradox, and sometimes the two are not distinguished. The study of self-reference led to important developments in logic and mathematics in the twentieth century.\n\nIn other words, it is not a paradox once one realizes \"All Cretans are liars\" being untrue only means \"Not all Cretans are liars\" instead of the assumption that \"All Cretans are honest\".\n\nPerhaps better put, for \"All Cretans are liars\" to be a true statement, it does not mean that all Cretans must lie all the time. In fact Cretans could tell the truth quite often but still all be liars in the sense that liars are people prone to deception for dishonest gain. Considering that \u201cAll Cretans are liars\u201d has been seen as a paradox only since the 19th century, this seems to resolve the alleged paradox. Of course if \u2018all Cretans are continuous liars\u2019 is actually true, then asking a Cretan if they are honest would always elicit the dishonest answer \u2018yes\u2019. So arguably the original proposition is not so much paradoxical as invalid. \n\nA contextual reading of the contradiction may also provide an answer to the paradox. The original phrase, \"The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!\" asserts not an intrinsic paradox, but rather an opinion of the Cretans from Epimenides. A stereotyping of his people not intended to be an absolute statement about the people as a whole. Rather it is a claim made about their position regarding their religious beliefs and socio-cultural attitudes. Within the context of his poem the phrase is specific to a certain belief, a context that Callimachus repeats in his poem regarding Zeus. Further, a more poignant answer to the paradox is simply that to be a ''liar'' is to state falsehoods, nothing in the statement asserts everything said is false,  but rather they're \"always\" lying. This is not an absolute statement of fact and thus we cannot conclude there's a true contradiction made by Epimenides with this statement.\n\n== Origin of the phrase ==\nEpimenides was a 6th-century BC philosopher and religious prophet who, against the general sentiment of Crete, proposed that [[Zeus]] was immortal, as in the following [[poem]]:\n{{Quotation|They fashioned a tomb for thee, O holy and high one<br>The Cretans, always liars, evil beasts, idle bellies!<br>But thou art not dead: thou livest and abidest forever,<br>For in thee we live and move and have our being.|Epimenides|Cretica}}\n\nDenying the immortality of Zeus, then, was the lie of the Cretans.\n\nThe phrase \"Cretans, always liars\" was quoted by the poet [[Callimachus]] in his ''Hymn to Zeus'', with the same theological intent as Epimenides:\n\n{{Quotation|O Zeus, some say that thou wert born on the hills of Ida;<br> Others, O Zeus, say in Arcadia;<br> Did these or those, O Father lie? -- \u201cCretans are ever liars.\u201d <br>Yea, a tomb, O Lord, for thee the Cretans builded;<br> But thou didst not die, for thou art for ever.|Callimachus|Hymn I to Zeus}}\n\n==Emergence as a logical contradiction==\nThe logical inconsistency of a Cretan asserting all Cretans are always liars may not have occurred to Epimenides, nor to [[Callimachus]], who both used the phrase to emphasize their point, without irony, perhaps meaning that all Cretans lie routinely, but not exclusively.\n\nIn the 1st century AD, the quote is mentioned by Paul as the words of a man who was insubordinate, an empty talker and a deceiver, yet spoke truly in this statement.\n\n{{Quotation|One of Crete's own prophets has said it: 'Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, idle bellies'.<br>He has surely told the truth. For this reason correct them sternly, that they may be sound in faith instead of paying attention to Jewish fables and to commandments of people who turn their backs on the truth. |Epistle to Titus, 1:12\u201313}}\n\n[[Clement of Alexandria]], in the late 2nd century AD, fails to indicate that the concept of logical paradox is an issue:\n\n{{Quotation|In his epistle to [[Saint Titus|Titus]], [[Apostle Paul]] wants to warn Titus that Cretans don't believe in the one truth of Christianity, because \"Cretans are always liars\". To justify his claim, Apostle Paul cites Epimenides. |[[Stromata]] 1.14}}\n\nDuring the early 4th century, [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] restates the closely related liar paradox in ''[[Against the Academicians]]'' (III.13.29), but without mentioning Epimenides.\n\nIn the [[Middle Ages]], many forms of the liar paradox were studied under the heading of [[insolubilia]], but these were not explicitly associated with Epimenides.\n\nFinally, in 1740, the second volume of [[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' explicitly connects Epimenides with the paradox, though Bayle labels the paradox a \"sophisme\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionnaire Historique et Critique |last= Bayle |first= Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Bayle |edition=5th |year=1740 |volume=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKs-AAAAcAAJ&dq=epimenides%20logic&pg=PA414#v=onepage&q=qu'Epimenide&f=false |page=414 |accessdate=1 April 2011}}  ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]'' at Wikipedia.</ref>\n\n== References by other authors==\nAll of the works of Epimenides are now lost, and known only through quotations by other authors. The quotation from the ''Cretica'' of Epimenides is given by R.N. Longenecker, \"Acts of the Apostles\", in volume 9 of ''The Expositor's Bible Commentary'', [[Frank E. Gaebelein]], editor (Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan Corporation, 1976\u20131984), page 476. Longenecker in turn cites M.D. Gibson, ''Horae Semiticae X'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1913), page 40, \"in [[Syriac language|Syriac]]\". Longenecker states the following in a footnote:\n\n: The Syr. version of the quatrain comes to us from the Syr. church father [[Isho'dad of Merv]] (probably based on the work of [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]]), which J.R. Harris translated back into Gr. in Exp [\"The Expositor\"] 7 (1907), p 336.\n\nAn oblique reference to Epimenides in the context of logic appears in \"The Logical Calculus\" by W. E. Johnson, ''Mind'' (New Series), volume 1, number 2 (April, 1892), pages 235\u2013250. Johnson writes in a footnote,\n\n:Compare, for example, such occasions for fallacy as are supplied by \"Epimenides is a liar\" or \"That surface is red,\" which may be resolved into \"All or some statements of Epimenides are false,\" \"All or some of the surface is red.\"\n\nThe Epimenides paradox appears explicitly in \"Mathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types\", by [[Bertrand Russell]], in the ''American Journal of Mathematics'', volume 30, number 3 (July, 1908), pages 222\u2013262, which opens with the following:\n\n:The oldest contradiction of the kind in question is the Epimenides. Epimenides the Cretan said that all Cretans were liars, and all other statements made by Cretans were certainly lies. Was this a lie?\n\nIn that article, Russell uses the Epimenides paradox as the point of departure for discussions of other problems, including the [[Burali-Forti paradox]] and the paradox now called [[Russell's paradox]]. Since Russell, the Epimenides paradox has been referenced repeatedly in logic. Typical of these references is ''[[G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach]]'' by [[Douglas Hofstadter]], which accords the paradox a prominent place in a discussion of self-reference.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite IEP |url-id=par-liar |title=\"Liar Paradox\"}}\n\n{{Paradoxes}}\n\n[[Category:Self-referential paradoxes]]\n[[Category:Paul the Apostle]]\n[[Category:New Testament words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Ancient Crete]]\n\n[[ru:\u042d\u043f\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0434#\u041f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043a\u0441 \u042d\u043f\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0434\u0430]]", "sha1": "0e0iac77mdna9eooilg6iriyzfswogs"}}, {"title": "Engine", "ns": "0", "id": "9640", "revision": {"id": "866309282", "parentid": "866308795", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T15:53:51Z", "contributor": {"username": "Kb03", "id": "19012991"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/71.43.154.250|71.43.154.250]] ([[User talk:71.43.154.250|talk]]) to last version by Andy Dingley", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Redirect|Motor}}\n[[File:Mercedes V6 DTM Rennmotor 1996.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A V6 [[internal combustion engine]] from a [[Mercedes-Benz]]]]\n\nAn '''engine''' or '''motor''' is a [[machine]] designed to convert one form of [[energy]] into [[Motion (physics)|mechanical energy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/motor |title=Motor |quote=a person or thing that imparts motion, esp. a contrivance, as a steam engine, that receives and modifies energy from some source in order to utilize it in driving machinery. |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref><ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/motor Dictionary.com: (World heritage)] \"3. any device that converts another form of energy into mechanical energy so as to produce motion\"</ref> [[Heat engine]]s burn a [[fuel]] to create [[heat]] which is then used to do [[work (physics)|work]]. [[Internal combustion engines]] are heat engines that burn fuel in a combustion chamber to extract work from the pressure of expanding gases. [[Electric motor]]s convert electrical energy into [[machine (mechanical)|mechanical]] motion; [[pneumatic motor]]s use [[compressed air]]; and [[clockwork motor]]s in [[wind-up toy]]s use [[elastic energy]]. In biological systems, [[molecular motor]]s, like [[myosin]]s in [[muscle]]s, use [[chemical energy]] to create forces and eventually motion.\n\n==Terminology==\n\nThe word ''engine'' derives from  [[Old French]] ''[[wikt:engin|engin]]'', from the [[Latin]] ''ingenium''\u2013the root of the word ''[[wikt:ingenious|ingenious]]''. Pre-industrial weapons of war, such as [[catapult]]s, [[trebuchet]]s and [[battering ram]]s, were called ''[[siege engine]]s'', and knowledge of how to construct them was often treated as a military secret. The word ''gin'', as in  ''[[cotton gin]]'', is short for ''engine''.  Most mechanical devices invented during the [[industrial revolution]] were described as engines\u2014the steam engine being a notable example. However, the original steam engines, such as those by [[Thomas Savery]], were not mechanical engines but pumps. In this manner, a [[fire engine]] in its original form was merely a water pump, with the engine being transported to the fire by horses.\n\nIn modern usage, the term ''engine'' typically describes devices, like steam engines and internal combustion engines, that burn or otherwise consume fuel to perform [[mechanical work]] by exerting a [[torque]] or linear [[force]] (usually in the form of [[thrust]]). Devices converting heat energy into motion are commonly referred to simply as ''engines''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Engine |work=Collins English Dictionary |access-date=2012-09-03 |url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/Engine}}</ref> Examples of engines which exert a torque include the familiar automobile gasoline and diesel engines, as well as [[turboshaft]]s. Examples of engines which produce thrust include [[turbofan]]s and [[rocket]]s.\n\nWhen the internal combustion engine was invented, the term ''motor'' was initially used to distinguish it from the steam engine\u2014which was in wide use at the time, powering locomotives and other vehicles such as [[steamroller|steam rollers]]. The term ''[[wikt:motor|motor]]'' derives from the Latin verb ''[[Wikt:moto#Verb|moto]]'' which means to set in motion, or maintain motion. Thus a motor is a device that imparts motion.\n\n''Motor'' and ''engine'' are interchangeable in standard English.<ref>Dictionary definitions:\n* {{OED|motor}}\n* {{OED|engine}}\n* {{Cite Merriam-Webster|motor}}\n* {{Cite Merriam-Webster|engine}}\n* {{Cite Dictionary.com|motor}}\n* {{Cite Dictionary.com|engine}}</ref> In some engineering jargons, the two words have different meanings, in which ''[[wiktionary:engine|engine]]'' is a device that [[combustion|burns]] or otherwise consumes fuel, changing its chemical composition, and a motor is a device driven by [[Electric motor|electricity]], [[pneumatic motor|air]], or [[hydraulic motor|hydraulic]] pressure, which does not change the chemical composition of its energy source.<ref>\"Engine\", ''McGraw-Hill Concise Encyclopedia of Science and Technology'', Third Edition, Sybil P.

Another way of looking at it is that a motor receives power from an external source, and then converts it into mechanical energy, while an engine creates power from pressure (derived directly from the explosive force of combustion or other [[chemical]] reaction, or secondarily from the action of some such force on other substances such as air, water, or steam).<ref>{{cite book|last=Press|first=AIP, Associated|title=Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law|year=2007|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-465-00489-8|pages=84|edition=42nd}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Antiquity===\n[[Simple machine]]s, such as the [[Mace (bludgeon)|club]] and [[oar]] (examples of the [[lever]]), are [[Prehistory|prehistoric]]. More complex engines using [[Manual labour|human power]], [[Working animals|animal power]], [[Water wheel|water power]], [[Windmill|wind power]] and even steam power date back to antiquity. Human power was focused by the use of simple engines, such as the [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]], [[windlass]] or [[Treadwheel|treadmill]], and with [[rope]]s, [[pulley]]s, and [[block and tackle]] arrangements; this power was transmitted usually with the forces [[mechanical advantage|multiplied]] and the speed [[gear reduction|reduced]]. These were used in [[Crane (machine)|cranes]] and aboard [[ship]]s in [[Ancient Greece]], as well as in [[Mining|mine]]s, [[Pump|water pump]]s and [[siege engines]] in [[Ancient Rome]]. The writers of those times, including [[Vitruvius]], [[Frontinus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], treat these engines as commonplace, so their invention may be more ancient. By the 1st century AD, [[cattle]] and [[horse]]s were used in [[Mill (grinding)|mill]]s, driving machines similar to those powered by humans in earlier times.\n\nAccording to [[Strabo]], a water powered mill was built in Kaberia of the [[Parthian Empire|kingdom of Mithridates]] during the 1st century BC. Use of [[water wheel]]s in mills spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]] over the next few centuries. Some were quite complex, with [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]]s, [[dam]]s, and [[sluice]]s to maintain and channel the water, along with systems of [[gears]], or toothed-wheels made of wood and metal to regulate the speed of rotation. More sophisticated small devices, such as the [[Antikythera Mechanism]] used complex trains of gears and dials to act as calendars or predict astronomical events. In a poem by [[Ausonius]] in the 4th century AD, he mentions a stone-cutting saw powered by water. [[Hero of Alexandria]] is credited with many such [[wind]] and [[steam]] powered machines in the 1st century AD, including the [[Aeolipile]] and the [[vending machine]], often these machines were associated with worship, such as animated altars and automated temple doors.\n\n===Medieval===\nMedieval Muslim engineers employed [[gear]]s in mills and water-raising machines, and used [[dam]]s as a source of water power to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.<ref name=Hassan>{{cite book|first1=Ahmad Y. |last1=Hassan |authorlink1=Ahmad Y.

Driven by gunpowder, this simplest form of internal combustion engine was unable to deliver sustained power, but was useful for propelling weaponry at high speeds towards enemies in battle and for [[fireworks]]. After invention, this innovation spread throughout Europe.\n\n===Industrial Revolution===\n[[Image:Boulton and Watt centrifugal governor-MJ.jpg|thumb|upright|Boulton & Watt engine of 1788]]\nThe [[Watt steam engine]] was the first type of steam engine to make use of steam at a pressure just above [[atmospheric pressure|atmospheric]] to drive the piston helped by a partial vacuum. Improving on the design of the 1712 [[Newcomen steam engine]], the Watt steam engine, developed sporadically from 1763 to 1775, was a great step in the development of the steam engine. Offering a dramatic increase in [[fuel efficiency]], [[James Watt]]'s design became synonymous with steam engines, due in no small part to his business partner, [[Matthew Boulton]]. It enabled rapid development of efficient semi-automated factories on a previously unimaginable scale in places where waterpower was not available. Later development led to [[steam locomotive]]s and great expansion of [[Rail transport|railway transportation]].\n\nAs for internal combustion piston engines, these were tested in France in 1807 by [[de Rivaz]] and independently, by the [[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce|Ni\u00e9pce brothers]]. They were theoretically advanced by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Carnot]] in 1824.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 1853-57 [[Eugenio Barsanti]] and [[Felice Matteucci]] invented and patented an engine using the free-piston principle that was possibly the first 4-cycle engine.<ref>{{cite web|title=La documentazione essenziale per l'attribuzione della scoperta|url=http://www.barsantiematteucci.it/inglese/documentiStorici.html|quote= A later request was presented to the Patent Office of the Reign of Piedmont, under No. 700 of Volume VII of that Office.

The lightweight petrol internal combustion engine, operating on a four-stroke Otto cycle, has been the most successful for light automobiles, while the more efficient [[Diesel engine]] is used for trucks and buses. However, in recent years, turbo Diesel engines have become increasingly popular, especially outside of the United States, even for quite small cars.\n\n====Horizontally opposed pistons====\nIn 1896, Karl Benz was granted a patent for his design of the first engine with horizontally opposed pistons. His design created an engine in which the corresponding pistons move in horizontal cylinders and reach top dead center simultaneously, thus automatically balancing each other with respect to their individual momentum. Engines of this design are often referred to as flat engines because of their shape and lower profile. They were used in the [[Volkswagen Beetle]], the [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]], some Porsche and Subaru cars, many [[BMW]] and [[Honda]] [[motorcycle]]s, and propeller [[aircraft engine]]s.\n\n====Advancement====\nContinuance of the use of the internal combustion engine for automobiles is partly due to the improvement of engine control systems (onboard computers providing engine management processes, and electronically controlled fuel injection). Forced air induction by turbocharging and supercharging have increased power outputs and engine efficiencies. Similar changes have been applied to smaller diesel engines giving them almost the same power characteristics as petrol engines. This is especially evident with the popularity of smaller diesel engine propelled cars in Europe. Larger diesel engines are still often used in trucks and heavy machinery, although they require special machining not available in most factories. Diesel engines produce lower [[hydrocarbon]] and {{CO2}} emissions, but greater [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate]] and {{NOx|link=yes}} pollution, than gasoline engines.<ref name=Harrison2001>{{Citation |title= Pollution: Causes, Effects and Control |first= Roy M. |last= Harrison |authorlink=Roy M.

The higher forces and pressures created by these changes created engine vibration and size problems that led to stiffer, more compact engines with V and opposed cylinder layouts replacing longer straight-line arrangements.\n\n====Combustion efficiency====\nThe design principles favoured in Europe, because of economic and other restraints such as smaller and twistier roads, leant toward smaller cars and corresponding to the design principles that concentrated on increasing the combustion efficiency of smaller engines. This produced more economical engines with earlier four-cylinder designs rated at 40 horsepower (30&nbsp;kW) and six-cylinder designs rated as low as 80 horsepower (60&nbsp;kW), compared with the large volume V-8 American engines with power ratings in the range from 250 to 350&nbsp;hp, some even over 400&nbsp;hp (190 to 260&nbsp;kW).{{Clarify|reason=What time period is this paragraph about?|date=June 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n====Engine configuration====\nEarlier automobile engine development produced a much larger range of engines than is in common use today. Engines have ranged from 1- to 16-cylinder designs with corresponding differences in overall size, weight, [[engine displacement]], and cylinder [[Bore (engine)|bores]]. Four cylinders and power ratings from 19 to 120&nbsp;hp (14 to 90&nbsp;kW) were followed in a majority of the models. Several three-cylinder, two-stroke-cycle models were built while most engines had straight or in-line cylinders. There were several V-type models and horizontally opposed two- and four-cylinder makes too. Overhead [[camshaft]]s were frequently employed. The smaller engines were commonly air-cooled and located at the rear of the vehicle; compression ratios were relatively low. The 1970s and 1980s saw an increased interest in improved [[Fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], which caused a return to smaller V-6 and four-cylinder layouts, with as many as five valves per cylinder to improve efficiency. The [[Bugatti Veyron]] 16.4 operates with a [[W16 engine]], meaning that two [[V8 engine|V8]] cylinder layouts are positioned next to each other to create the W&nbsp;shape sharing the same crankshaft.\n\nThe largest internal combustion engine ever built is the [[W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4-Sulzer RTA96-C]], a 14-cylinder, 2-stroke turbocharged diesel engine that was designed to power the ''[[Emma M\u00e6rsk]]'', the largest container ship in the world. This engine has a mass of 2,300 tonnes, and when running at 102&nbsp;RPM (1.7 Hz) produces over 80 MW, and can use up to 250 tonnes of fuel each day.\n\n==Types==\nAn engine can be put into a category according to two criteria: the form of energy it accepts in order to create motion, and the type of motion it outputs.\n\n===Heat engine===\n{{Main|heat engine}}\n\n====Combustion engine====\nCombustion engines are [[heat engine]]s driven by the heat of a [[combustion]] process.\n\n=====Internal combustion engine=====\n{{Main|Internal combustion engine}}\n[[File:4StrokeEngine Ortho 3D Small.gif|thumb|right|225px|Animation showing the four stages of the [[Four-stroke engine|four-stroke]] combustion engine cycle: {{ordered list |Induction ''(Fuel enters)'' |Compression |Ignition ''(Fuel is burnt)'' |Emission ''(Exhaust out)''}}]]\n\nThe '''internal combustion engine''' is an engine in which the [[combustion]] of a fuel (generally, [[fossil fuel]]) occurs with an oxidizer (usually air) in a [[combustion chamber]]. In an internal combustion engine the expansion of the high [[temperature]] and high [[pressure]] gases, which are produced by the combustion, directly applies [[force]] to components of the engine, such as the [[piston]]s or [[turbine blade]]s or a [[propulsive nozzle|nozzle]], and by moving it over a distance, generates mechanical [[work (physics)|work]].<ref name=r1 >{{cite web|first=Charles Lafayette |last=Proctor II |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/290504/internal-combustion-engine |title=Internal Combustion engines |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |date= |accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref><ref name=r2 >{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/internal-combustion-engine?cat=technology |title=Internal combustion engine |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref><ref name=r3>{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.bartleby.com/65/in/intern-co.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721063446/http://inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.bartleby.com/65/in/intern-co.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-21 |title=Columbia encyclopedia: Internal combustion engine |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-09 }}</ref><ref name=r4 >{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/sci/A0825332.html |title=Internal-combustion engine |publisher=Infoplease.com |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref>\n\n=====External combustion engine=====\n{{Main|external combustion engine}}\nAn '''external combustion engine''' (EC engine) is a [[heat engine]] where an internal working [[fluid]] is heated by combustion of an external source, through the engine wall or a [[heat exchanger]]. The [[fluid]] then, by expanding and acting on the [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanism]] of the engine produces motion and usable [[Mechanical work|work]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/external%20combustion |title=External combustion |publisher=Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary |date=2010-08-13 |accessdate=2011-05-09}}</ref> The fluid is then cooled, compressed and reused (closed cycle), or (less commonly) dumped, and cool fluid pulled in (open cycle air engine).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://carfromjapan.com/article/car-maintenance/types-car-engines-everything-wanted-know/ |title=Types Of Car Engines \u2013 Everything You Wanted To Know |first=Tsukasa |last=Azuma |website=Car From Japan |date=2014-12-01 |access-date=2018-02-04}}</ref>\n\n\"[[Combustion]]\" refers to [[burning]] fuel with an [[oxidizer]], to supply the heat. Engines of similar (or even identical) configuration and operation may use a supply of heat from other sources such as nuclear, solar, geothermal or exothermic reactions not involving combustion; but are not then strictly classed as external combustion engines, but as external thermal engines.\n\nThe working fluid can be a gas as in a [[Stirling engine]], or [[steam]] as in a steam engine or an organic liquid such as n-pentane in an [[Organic Rankine cycle]].  The fluid can be of any composition; gas is by far the most common, although even single-phase [[liquid]] is sometimes used.  In the case of the steam engine, the fluid changes [[Phase (matter)|phase]]s between liquid and gas.\n\n=====Air-breathing combustion engines=====\n\n'''Air-breathing combustion engines''' are combustion engines that use the [[oxygen]] in atmospheric air to [[oxidise]] ('burn') the fuel, rather than carrying an [[oxidiser]], as in a [[rocket]]. Theoretically, this should result in a better [[specific impulse]] than for rocket engines.\n\nA continuous stream of air flows through the air-breathing engine. This air is compressed, mixed with fuel, ignited and expelled as the [[exhaust gas]].\n\n;Examples\nTypical air-breathing engines include:\n*[[Reciprocating engine]]\n*[[Steam engine]]\n*[[Gas turbine]]\n:[[airbreathing jet engine]]\n:[[Turboprop|Turbo-propeller engine]]\n*[[Pulse detonation engine]]\n*[[Pulse jet]]\n*[[Ramjet]]\n*[[Scramjet]]\n*[[Liquid air cycle engine]]/[[Reaction Engines SABRE]].\n\n=====Environmental effects=====\nThe operation of engines typically has a negative impact upon [[air quality]] and ambient [[noise pollution|sound levels]]. There has been a growing emphasis on the pollution producing features of automotive power systems. This has created new interest in alternate power sources and internal-combustion engine refinements. Though a few limited-production battery-powered electric vehicles have appeared, they have not proved competitive owing to costs and operating characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In the 21st century the diesel engine has been increasing in popularity with automobile owners. However, the gasoline engine and the Diesel engine,  with their new emission-control devices to improve emission performance, have not yet been significantly challenged.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} A number of manufacturers have introduced hybrid engines, mainly involving a small gasoline engine coupled with an electric motor and with a large battery bank,  but these too have yet to make much of an inroad into the market shares of gasoline and Diesel engines.\n\n=====Air quality=====\nExhaust from a spark ignition engine consists of the following: [[nitrogen]] 70 to 75% (by volume), [[water vapor]] 10 to 12%, [[carbon dioxide]] 10 to 13.5%, [[hydrogen]] 0.5 to 2%, [[oxygen]] 0.2 to 2%, [[carbon monoxide]]: 0.1 to 6%, unburnt [[hydrocarbons]] and partial [[oxidation]] products (e.g. [[aldehyde]]s) 0.5 to 1%, [[nitrogen monoxide]] 0.01 to 0.4%, [[nitrous oxide]] <100 ppm, [[sulfur dioxide]] 15 to 60 ppm, traces of other compounds such as fuel additives and lubricants, also halogen and metallic compounds, and other particles.<ref>Paul Degobert, Society of Automotive Engineers (1995), ''Automobiles and Pollution''</ref> Carbon monoxide is highly toxic, and can cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], so it is important to avoid any build-up of the gas in a confined space. [[Catalytic converter]]s can reduce toxic emissions, but not completely eliminate them. Also, resulting greenhouse gas emissions, chiefly [[carbon dioxide]], from the widespread use of engines in the modern industrialized world is contributing to the global [[greenhouse effect]] \u2013 a primary concern regarding [[global warming]].\n\n====Non-combusting heat engines====\n{{Main|heat engine}}\nSome engines convert heat from noncombustive processes into mechanical work, for example a nuclear power plant uses the heat from the nuclear reaction to produce steam and drive a steam engine, or a gas turbine in a rocket engine may be driven by decomposing [[hydrogen peroxide]]. Apart from the different energy source, the engine is often engineered much the same as an internal or external combustion engine. Another group of noncombustive engines includes [[thermoacoustic heat engine]]s (sometimes called \"TA engines\") which are thermoacoustic devices which use high-amplitude sound waves to pump heat from one place to another, or conversely use a heat difference to induce high-amplitude sound waves. In general, thermoacoustic engines can be divided into standing wave and travelling wave devices.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/147785416/Experimental-Investigations-on-a-Standing-Wave-Thermoacoustic-Engine#fullscreen |first=Mahmoud |last=Emam |title=Experimental Investigations on a Standing-Wave Thermoacoustic Engine, M.Sc.

Examples include:\n\n*[[Molecular motor]] - motors found in living things\n*[[Synthetic molecular motor]].\n\n===Electric motor===\n{{Main|electric motor|electric vehicle}}\nAn '''electric motor''' uses [[electrical energy]] to produce [[mechanical energy]], usually through the interaction of [[magnetic fields]] and [[electrical conductor|current-carrying conductors]]. The reverse process, producing electrical energy from mechanical energy, is accomplished by a [[Electrical generator|generator]] or [[dynamo]]. [[Traction motor]]s used on vehicles often perform both tasks. Electric motors can be run as generators and vice versa, although this is not always practical.\nElectric motors are ubiquitous, being found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, [[power tools]], and [[hard drive|disk drives]].  They may be powered by direct current (for example a [[battery (electric)|battery]] powered portable device or motor vehicle), or by [[alternating current]] from a central electrical distribution grid. The smallest motors may be found in electric wristwatches. Medium-size motors of highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial uses. The very largest electric motors are used for propulsion of large ships, and for such purposes as pipeline compressors, with ratings in the thousands of [[watt (unit)|kilowatt]]s. Electric motors may be classified by the source of electric power, by their internal construction, and by their application.\n\nThe physical principle of production of mechanical force by the interactions of an electric current and a magnetic field was known as early as 1821. Electric motors of increasing efficiency were constructed throughout the 19th century, but commercial exploitation of electric motors on a large scale required efficient electrical generators and electrical distribution networks.\n\nTo reduce the electric [[energy consumption]] from motors and their associated [[carbon footprint]]s, various regulatory authorities in many countries have introduced and implemented legislation to encourage the manufacture and use of higher efficiency electric motors. A well-designed motor can convert over 90% of its input energy into useful power for decades.<ref>\"Motors\". American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. http://www.aceee.org/topics/motors</ref> When the efficiency of a motor is raised by even a few percentage points, the savings, in [[kilowatt hour]]s (and therefore in cost), are enormous. The electrical energy efficiency of a typical industrial [[induction motor]] can be improved by: 1) reducing the electrical losses in the [[stator]] windings (e.g., by increasing the cross-sectional area of the [[Electrical conductor|conductor]], improving the [[Inductor|winding]] technique, and using materials with higher [[Electrical conductivity|electrical conductivities]], such as [[copper]]), 2) reducing the electrical losses in the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] coil or casting (e.g., by using materials with higher electrical conductivities, such as copper), 3) reducing magnetic losses by using better quality magnetic [[steel]], 4) improving the [[aerodynamic]]s of motors to reduce mechanical windage losses, 5) improving [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] to reduce [[friction loss]]es, and 6) minimizing manufacturing [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]]. ''For further discussion on this subject, see [[Premium efficiency]].)''\n\nBy convention, ''electric engine'' refers to a railroad [[electric locomotive]], rather than an electric motor.\n\n===Physically powered motor===\nSome motors are powered by potential or kinetic energy, for example some [[funicular]]s, [[gravity plane]] and [[ropeway conveyor]]s have used the energy from moving water or rocks, and some clocks have a weight that falls under gravity. Other forms of potential energy include compressed gases (such as [[pneumatic motor]]s), springs ([[clockwork motor]]s) and [[Elastic band#Model use|elastic band]]s.\n\nHistoric [[military]] [[siege engines]] included large [[catapult]]s, [[trebuchet]]s, and (to some extent) [[battering ram]]s were powered by potential energy.\n\n====Pneumatic motor====\n{{main|Pneumatic motor}}\nA '''pneumatic motor''' is a machine that converts potential energy in the form of [[compressed air]] into [[mechanical work]]. Pneumatic motors generally convert the compressed air to mechanical work though either linear or rotary motion.  Linear motion can come from either a diaphragm or piston actuator, while rotary motion is supplied by either a vane type air motor or piston air motor.  Pneumatic motors have found widespread success in the hand-held tool industry and continual attempts are being made to expand their use to the transportation industry.  However, pneumatic motors must overcome efficiency deficiencies before being seen as a viable option in the transportation industry.\n\n====Hydraulic motor====\n{{main|Hydraulic motor }}\nA '''hydraulic motor''' is one that derives its power from a [[pressure|pressurized]] [[fluid]]. This type of engine can be used to move heavy loads or produce motion.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://reference.howstuffworks.com/hydraulic-engine-encyclopedia.htm \n |title=Howstuffworks \"Engineering\" \n |publisher=Reference.howstuffworks.com \n |date=2006-01-29 \n |accessdate=2011-05-09 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821175006/http://reference.howstuffworks.com/hydraulic-engine-encyclopedia.htm \n |archivedate=2009-08-21 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\n==Performance==\n\n===Engine speed===\nGiven that the majority of engines for which a speed is defined rotate, engine speed is measured in [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM).  Engines may be classified as low-speed, medium-speed or high-speed, but these terms are always relative and depend on the type of engine being described. Generally, diesel engines operate at lower speeds (~1500-2000 RPM for an automotive diesel) compared to gasoline engines (~2200-3400 RPM for an automotive gasoline engine). Electric motors and turboshafts are capable of very high speeds (~10,000 RPM or more), generally constrained only by the [[bulk modulus]] and intended service life of the parts constituting the rotor, which must bear the brunt of the [[centrifugal force]].\n\n===Thrust===\n[[Thrust]] is the force arising from the interaction between two masses which exert [[Newton's laws of motion|equal but opposite forces on each other]] due to their speed. The force {{math|F}} can be measured either in [[newtons]] (N, SI units) or more rarely in [[Pound (force)|pounds-thrust]] (lb<sub>f</sub>, imperial units).\n\n===Torque===\n[[Torque]] is the force being exerted on a theoretical lever connected to the output shaft of an engine. This is expressed by the formula:\n:<math>\\tau=|\\mathbf r\\times\\mathbf F|=r F\\sin(\\mathbf r, \\mathbf F)</math>\nwhere {{math|''r''}} is the length of the lever, {{math|''F''}} is the force applied on it, and {{math|'''r'''\u00d7'''F'''}} is the [[vector cross product]].\nTorque is typically measured  in [[newton meter|newton-metres]] (N\u00b7m, SI units) and a few countries use the older [[foot-pounds]] (ft\u00b7lb, imperial units).\n\n===Power===\n[[Power (physics)|Power]] is the amount of work being done, or energy being produced, per unit of time. This is expressed by the formula:\n:<math>P=\\frac{\\mathrm d W}{\\mathrm d t}</math>\n\nWith a quick demonstration, it can be shown that:\n:<math>P=\\mathbf F \\cdot \\mathbf v</math>\n\nThis formula with linear forces and speeds can be used equally well for both engines outputting thrust and engines exerting torque.\n\nWhen considering propulsive engines, typically only the raw force of the core mass flow is considered, leading to such engines having their 'power' rated in any of the units discussed above for forces.\n\nIf the engine in question outputs its power on a shaft, then:\n:<math>P=\\tau\\omega</math>.\n\nThis is the reason why any engine outputting its power on a rotating shaft is usually quoted, along with its rated power, the rotational speed at which that rated power is developed.\n\n===Efficiency===\n{{Main|Engine efficiency}}\nDepending on the type of engine employed, different rates of efficiency are attained.\n\nFor heat engines, efficiency cannot be greater than the [[Carnot efficiency]].\n\n===Sound levels===\nIn the case of sound levels, engine operation is of greatest impact with respect to mobile sources such as automobiles and trucks.  Engine noise is a particularly large component of mobile source noise for vehicles operating at lower speeds, where aerodynamic and tire noise is less significant.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x1707075n815g604/ |first=C.

Thrust-outputting engines, such as turbofans, turbojets and rockets emit the greatest amount of noise because their method of producing thrust is directly related to the production of sound.\nVarious methods have been devised to reduce noise. Petrol and diesel engines are fitted with [[muffler]]s (silencers); newer turbofans often have outsized fans (the so-called high-bypass technology) in order to reduce the proportion of noisy, hot exhaust from the integrated turboshaft in the exhaust stream, and hushkits exist for older, low-bypass turbofans. No known methods exist for reducing the noise output of rockets without a corresponding reduction in thrust.\n\n==Engines by use==\nParticularly notable kinds of engines include:\n\n*[[Aircraft engine]]\n*[[Automobile engine]]\n*[[Model engine]]\n*[[Motorcycle engine]]\n*[[Marine propulsion]] engines such as [[Outboard motor]]\n*[[Non-road engine]] is the term used to define engines that are not used by vehicles on roadways.\n*[[Railway locomotive]] engine\n*[[Spacecraft propulsion]] engines such as [[Rocket engine]]\n*[[Traction engine]]\n\n==See also==\n*[[Timeline of motor and engine technology]]\n*[[Timeline of heat engine technology]]\n*[[Electric motor]]\n*[[Engine cooling]]\n*[[Multifuel]]\n*[[Gasoline engine]]\n*[[Hesselman engine]]\n*[[HCCI|HCCI engine]]\n*[[Hot bulb engine]]\n*[[IRIS engine]]\n*[[Solid-state engine]]\n*[[Automobile engine replacement]]\n*[[Engine swap]]\n*[[Reaction engine]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* J.

information on the environment. \nIts goal is to help those involved in developing, implementing and evaluating [[environmental policy]], and to inform the general public.\n\n==Organization==\nThe EEA was established by the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) Regulation 1210/1990 (amended by EEC Regulation 933/1999 and EC Regulation 401/2009) and became operational in 1994,  headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].\n\nThe agency is governed by a management board composed of representatives of the governments of its 33 member states, a [[European Commission]] representative and two scientists appointed by the [[European Parliament]], assisted by a committee of scientists.\nThe current Executive Director of the agency is Professor [[Hans Bruyninckx]], who has been appointed for a five-year term. He is the successor of Professor [[Jacqueline McGlade]].\n\n==Member countries==\nThe [[Member states of the European Union|member states]] of the union are members; however other states may become members of it by means of agreements concluded between them and the EU.\n\nIt was the first EU body to open its membership to the 13 candidate countries (pre-[[enlargement of the EU|2004 enlargement]]).\n\nThe EEA has 33 member countries and six cooperating countries. The 33 member countries include the 28 EU Member States together with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.\n\nThe six Balkans countries are cooperating countries: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo under the UN Security Council Resolution 1244/99.

The initial version of Erlang was implemented in [[Prolog]] and was influenced by the programming language [[PLEX (programming language)|PLEX]] used in earlier Ericsson exchanges. By 1988 Erlang had proven that it was suitable for prototyping telephone exchanges, but the Prolog interpreter was far too slow. One group within Ericsson estimated that it would need to be 40 times faster in order to be suitable for production use. In 1992 work began on the [[BEAM (Erlang virtual machine)|BEAM]] virtual machine (VM) which compiles Erlang to C using a mix of natively compiled code and [[threaded code]] to strike a balance between performance and disk space.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Joe|title=The development of Erlang |url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=258948.258967 |journal=ACM SIGPLAN Notices|date=August 1997|volume=32|issue=8|pages=196\u2013203|doi=10.1145/258948.258967|accessdate=19 February 2016}}</ref> According to Armstrong, the language went from lab product to real applications following the collapse of the next-generation [[AXE telephone exchange|AXE exchange]] named ''AXE-N'' in 1995.

The expression <code>[Front || Front <- Rest, Front < Pivot]</code> is a [[list comprehension]], meaning \"Construct a list of elements <code>Front</code> such that <code>Front</code> is a member of <code>Rest</code>, and <code>Front</code> is less than <code>Pivot</code>.\" <code>++</code> is the list concatenation operator.\n\nA comparison function can be used for more complicated structures for the sake of readability.\n\nThe following code would sort lists according to length:\n<source lang=\"erlang\">\n% This is file 'listsort.erl' (the compiler is made this way)\n-module(listsort).\n% Export 'by_length' with 1 parameter (don't care about the type and name)\n-export([by_length/1]).\n\nby_length(Lists) -> % Use 'qsort/2' and provides an anonymous function as a parameter\n   qsort(Lists, fun(A,B) -> length(A) < length(B) end).\n\nqsort([], _)-> []; % If list is empty, return an empty list (ignore the second parameter)\nqsort([Pivot|Rest], Smaller) ->\n    % Partition list with 'Smaller' elements in front of 'Pivot' and not-'Smaller' elements\n    % after 'Pivot' and sort the sublists.\n    qsort([X || X <- Rest, Smaller(X,Pivot)], Smaller)\n    ++ [Pivot] ++\n    qsort([Y || Y <- Rest, not(Smaller(Y, Pivot))], Smaller).\n</source>\n\nHere again, a <code>Pivot</code> is taken from the first parameter given to <code>qsort()</code> and the rest of <code>Lists</code> is named <code>Rest</code>. Note that the expression\n\n<source lang=\"erlang\">[X || X <- Rest, Smaller(X,Pivot)]</source>\n\nis no different in form from\n\n<source lang=\"erlang\">[Front || Front <- Rest, Front < Pivot]</source>\n\n(in the previous example) except for the use of a comparison function in the last part, saying \"Construct a list of elements <code>X</code> such that <code>X</code> is a member of <code>Rest</code>, and <code>Smaller</code> is true\", with <code>Smaller</code> being defined earlier as\n\n<source lang=\"erlang\">fun(A,B) -> length(A) < length(B) end</source>\n\nNote also that the [[anonymous function]] is named <code>Smaller</code> in the parameter list of the second definition of <code>qsort</code> so that it can be referenced by that name within that function. It is not named in the first definition of <code>qsort</code>, which deals with the base case of an empty list and thus has no need of this function, let alone a name for it.\n\n==Data types==\nErlang has eight primitive [[data type]]s:\n\n;Integers: Integers are written as sequences of decimal digits, for example, 12, 12375 and -23427 are integers. Integer arithmetic is exact and only limited by available memory on the machine. (This is called [[arbitrary-precision arithmetic]].)\n;Atoms: Atoms are used within a program to denote distinguished values. They are written as strings of consecutive alphanumeric characters, the first character being lowercase. Atoms can contain any character if they are enclosed within single quotes and an escape convention exists which allows any character to be used within an atom. Atoms are never garbage collected and should be used with caution, specially if using dynamic atom generation.\n;Floats: Floating point numbers use the [[binary64|IEEE 754 64-bit representation]].\n;References: References are globally unique symbols whose only property is that they can be compared for equality. They are created by evaluating the Erlang primitive <code>make_ref()</code>.\n;Binaries: A binary is a sequence of bytes. Binaries provide a space-efficient way of storing binary data. Erlang primitives exist for composing and decomposing binaries and for efficient input/output of binaries.\n;Pids: Pid is short for ''process identifier''{{snd}}a Pid is created by the Erlang primitive <code>spawn(...)</code> Pids are references to Erlang processes.\n;Ports: Ports are used to communicate with the external world. Ports are created with the built-in function <code>open_port</code>. Messages can be sent to and received from ports, but these messages must obey the so-called \"port protocol.\"\n;Funs: Funs are function closures. Funs are created by expressions of the form: <code>fun(...) -> ... end</code>.\n\nAnd three compound data types:\n\n;Tuples: Tuples are containers for a fixed number of Erlang data types. The syntax <code>{D1,D2,...,Dn}</code> denotes a tuple whose arguments are <code>D1, D2, ... Dn.</code> The arguments can be primitive data types or compound data types. Any element of a tuple can be accessed in constant time.\n;Lists: Lists are containers for a variable number of Erlang data types. The syntax <code>[Dh|Dt]</code> denotes a list whose first element is <code>Dh</code>, and whose remaining elements are the list <code>Dt</code>. The syntax <code>[]</code> denotes an empty list. The syntax <code>[D1,D2,..,Dn]</code> is short for <code>[D1|[D2|..|[Dn|[]]]]</code>. The first element of a list can be accessed in constant time. The first element of a list is called the ''head'' of the list. The remainder of a list when its head has been removed is called the ''tail'' of the list.\n;Maps: Maps contain a variable number of key-value associations. The syntax is<code>#{Key1=>Value1,...,KeyN=>ValueN}</code>.\n\nTwo forms of [[syntactic sugar]] are provided:\n\n;Strings: Strings are written as doubly quoted lists of characters. This is syntactic sugar for a list of the integer [[ASCII]] codes for the characters in the string. Thus, for example, the string \"cat\" is shorthand for <code>[99,97,116]</code>. It has partial support for Unicode strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/unicode_usage.html|title=Erlang \u2013 Using Unicode in Erlang|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n;Records: Records provide a convenient way for associating a tag with each of the elements in a tuple. This allows one to refer to an element of a tuple by name and not by position. A pre-compiler takes the record definition and replaces it with the appropriate tuple reference.\n\nErlang has no method of defining classes, although there are external libraries available.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://code.google.com/p/ect/|title=ect \u2013 Erlang Class Transformation \u2013 add object-oriented programming to Erlang \u2013 Google Project Hosting|publisher=|accessdate=2 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Concurrency and distribution orientation==\nErlang's main strength is support for [[concurrency (computer science)|concurrency]]. It has a small but powerful set of primitives to create processes and communicate among them. Erlang is conceptually similar to the [[occam (programming language)|occam programming language]], though it recasts the ideas of [[communicating sequential processes]] (CSP) in a functional framework and uses asynchronous message passing.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  |title=Erlang\n  |journal=[[Communications of the ACM]]\n  |volume=53  |issue=9\n  |date=September 2010 \n  |pages=68\u201375\n  |doi=10.1145/1810891.1810910\n  |first=Joe|last=Armstrong \n  |authorlink=Joe Armstrong (programmer)\n  |quote=Erlang is conceptually similar to the occam programming language, though it recasts the ideas of CSP in a functional framework and uses asynchronous message passing.\n}}</ref> Processes are the primary means to structure an Erlang application.  They are neither operating system [[process (computing)|processes]] nor operating system [[thread (computer science)|threads]], but lightweight processes that are scheduled by BEAM. Like operating system processes (but unlike operating system threads), they share no state with each other. The estimated minimal overhead for each is 300 [[Word (data type)|words]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Erlang Efficiency Guide \u2013 Processes|url=http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/processes.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227174813/http://www.erlang.org/doc/efficiency_guide/processes.html|archivedate=27 February 2015}}</ref> Thus, many processes can be created without degrading performance. In 2005 a benchmark with 20 million processes was successfully performed with 64-bit Erlang on a machine with 16GB RAM (total 800 bytes/process).<ref>{{cite web|first=Ulf|last=Wiger|title=Stress-testing erlang| url=https://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.functional/msg/33b7a62afb727a4f?dmode=source| work=comp.lang.functional.misc|accessdate=25 August 2006|date=14 November 2005}}</ref> Erlang has supported [[symmetric multiprocessing]] since release R11B of May 2006.\n\nWhile [[thread (computer science)|thread]]s require external library support in most languages, Erlang provides language-level features for creating and managing processes with the aim of simplifying concurrent programming. Though all concurrency is explicit in Erlang, processes communicate using [[message passing]] instead of shared variables, which removes the need for explicit [[lock (computer science)|locks]] (a locking scheme is still used internally by the VM).<ref>{{cite web|title=Lock-free message queue|url=http://erlang.2086793.n4.nabble.com/Lock-free-message-queue-td2550221.html|accessdate=23 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Inter-process communication]] works via a [[Shared nothing architecture|shared-nothing]] [[asynchronous method dispatch|asynchronous]] [[message passing]] system: every process has a \"mailbox\", a [[queue (data structure)|queue]] of messages that have been sent by other processes and not yet consumed. A process uses the <code>receive</code> primitive to retrieve messages that match desired patterns. A message-handling routine tests messages in turn against each pattern, until one of them matches. When the message is consumed and removed from the mailbox the process resumes execution. A message may comprise any Erlang structure, including primitives (integers, floats, characters, atoms), tuples, lists, and functions.\n\nThe code example below shows the built-in support for distributed processes:\n\n<source lang=\"erlang\">\n % Create a process and invoke the function web:start_server(Port, MaxConnections)\n ServerProcess = spawn(web, start_server, [Port, MaxConnections]),\n\n % Create a remote process and invoke the function\n % web:start_server(Port, MaxConnections) on machine RemoteNode\n RemoteProcess = spawn(RemoteNode, web, start_server, [Port, MaxConnections]),\n\n % Send a message to ServerProcess (asynchronously). The message consists of a tuple\n % with the atom \"pause\" and the number \"10\".\n ServerProcess ! {pause, 10},\n\n % Receive messages sent to this process\n receive\n         a_message -> do_something;\n         {data, DataContent} -> handle(DataContent);\n         {hello, Text} -> io:format(\"Got hello message: ~s\", [Text]);\n         {goodbye, Text} -> io:format(\"Got goodbye message: ~s\", [Text])\n end.\n</source>\n\nAs the example shows, processes may be created on remote nodes, and communication with them is transparent in the sense that communication with remote processes works exactly as communication with local processes.\n\nConcurrency supports the primary method of error-handling in Erlang. When a process crashes, it neatly exits and sends a message to the controlling process which can then take action, such as for instance starting a new process that takes over the old process's task.<ref>{{cite web|first=Joe|last=Armstrong|title=Erlang robustness|url=http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/robustness.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423182840/http://www.erlang.org/doc/getting_started/robustness.html|archivedate=23 April 2015|accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Erlang Supervision principles|url=http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206050600/http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html|archivedate=6 February 2015|accessdate=15 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Implementation==\nThe official reference implementation of Erlang uses BEAM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/code_loading.html#id90080|title=Erlang -- Compilation and Code Loading|website=erlang.org|access-date=2017-12-21}}</ref> BEAM is included in the official distribution of Erlang, called Erlang/OTP. BEAM executes [[bytecode]] which is converted to [[threaded code]] at load time. It also includes a native code compiler on most platforms, developed by the High Performance Erlang Project (HiPE) at [[Uppsala University]]. Since October 2001 the HiPE system is fully integrated in Ericsson's Open Source Erlang/OTP system.<ref>{{cite web|title=High Performance Erlang|url=http://www.it.uu.se/research/group/hipe/|accessdate=26 March 2011}}</ref> It also supports interpreting, directly from source code via [[abstract syntax tree]], via script as of R11B-5 release of Erlang.\n\n==Hot code loading and modules==\nErlang supports language-level [[Dynamic Software Updating]]. To implement this, code is loaded and managed as \"module\" units; the module is a [[compilation unit]]. The system can keep two versions of a module in memory at the same time, and processes can concurrently run code from each. The versions are referred to as the \"new\" and the \"old\" version. A process will not move into the new version until it makes an external call to its module.\n\nAn example of the mechanism of hot code loading:\n\n<source lang = \"erlang\">\n  %% A process whose only job is to keep a counter.\n  %% First version\n  -module(counter).\n  -export([start/0, codeswitch/1]).\n\n  start() -> loop(0).\n\n  loop(Sum) ->\n    receive\n       {increment, Count} ->\n          loop(Sum+Count);\n       {counter, Pid} ->\n          Pid ! {counter, Sum},\n          loop(Sum);\n       code_switch ->\n          ?MODULE:codeswitch(Sum)\n          % Force the use of 'codeswitch/1' from the latest MODULE version\n    end.\n\n  codeswitch(Sum) -> loop(Sum).\n</source>\n\nFor the second version, we add the possibility to reset the count to zero.\n\n<source lang = \"erlang\">\n  %% Second version\n  -module(counter).\n  -export([start/0, codeswitch/1]).\n\n  start() -> loop(0).\n\n  loop(Sum) ->\n    receive\n       {increment, Count} ->\n          loop(Sum+Count);\n       reset ->\n          loop(0);\n       {counter, Pid} ->\n          Pid ! {counter, Sum},\n          loop(Sum);\n       code_switch ->\n          ?MODULE:codeswitch(Sum)\n    end.\n\n  codeswitch(Sum) -> loop(Sum).\n</source>\n\nOnly when receiving a message consisting of the atom 'code_switch' will the loop execute an external call to codeswitch/1 (<code>?MODULE</code> is a preprocessor macro for the current module). If there is a new version of the \"counter\" module in memory, then its codeswitch/1 function will be called. The practice of having a specific entry-point into a new version allows the programmer to transform state to what is required in the newer version. In our example we keep the state as an integer.\n\nIn practice, systems are built up using design principles from the Open Telecom Platform which leads to more code upgradable designs. Successful hot code loading is a tricky subject; Code needs to be written with care to make use of Erlang's facilities.\n\n==Distribution==\nIn 1998, Ericsson released Erlang as [[open source]] to ensure its independence from a single vendor and to increase awareness of the language. Erlang, together with libraries and the real-time distributed database [[Mnesia]], forms the OTP collection of libraries. Ericsson and a few other companies offer commercial support for Erlang.\n\nSince the open source release, Erlang has been used by several firms worldwide, including [[Nortel Networks|Nortel]] and [[T-Mobile]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Who uses Erlang for product development?|work=Frequently asked questions about Erlang|url=http://erlang.org/faq/introduction.html#idp32141008|accessdate=16 July 2007|quote=''The largest user of Erlang is (surprise!)

Initially developed (though not publicly released) on the [[Atari ST]],<ref name=atari1/> the first commercial release<ref name=firstversion/> was for the 16-bit [[DOS]] platform and was [[Proprietary software|proprietary]]. In 2006, with the release of version 3,<ref name=opensource/> Euphoria became [[open-source software]]. The openEuphoria Group continues to administer and develop the project.<ref name=oehomepage/>  In December 2010, the openEuphoria Group released version 4<ref name=oedownload/> of openEuphoria along with a new identity and mascot for the project. OpenEuphoria is currently available for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[macOS]] and three flavors of [[Berkeley Software Distribution#Significant BSD descendants|*BSD]].\n\nEuphoria is a general-purpose [[High-level programming language|high-level]] [[Imperative programming|imperative-procedural]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]] language. A [[translator (computers)|translator]] generates [[C (programming language)|C]] [[source code]] and the [[GNU compiler collection]] (GCC) and [[Open Watcom]] compilers are supported. Alternatively, Euphoria programs may be bound<ref name=binding/> with the interpreter to create stand-alone [[executable]]s. A number of [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) libraries are supported including Win32lib<ref name=win32lib/> and [[wrapper function|wrappers]] for [[wxWidgets]],<ref name=wxeuphoria/> [[GTK+]]<ref name=GTK/> and [[IUP (software)|IUP]].<ref name=IUP/> Euphoria has a simple built-in [[database]]<ref name=database/> and wrappers for a variety of other databases.<ref name=oedatabases/>\n\n==Overview==\nThe Euphoria language is a general purpose [[procedural programming|procedural language]] that focuses on simplicity, legibility, rapid development and performance via several means.\n*''Simplicity'' \u2013 It uses just four built-in data types (see below) and implements automatic [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]].\n*''Legibility'' \u2013 The syntax favors simple English keywords over the use of punctuation to delineate constructs.\n*''Rapid development'' \u2013 An [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] encourages prototyping and incremental development.\n*''Performance'' \u2013 An efficient reference-counting garbage collector correctly handles cyclic references.\n\n==History==\nDeveloped as a personal project to invent a programming language from scratch, Euphoria was created by Robert Craig<ref name=rehomepage/> on an [[Atari ST|Atari Mega-ST]].<ref name=atari1/> Many design ideas for the language came from Craig's [[Masters degree|Master's]] [[thesis]] in [[computer science]] at the [[University of Toronto]].<ref name=renotes/> Craig's thesis was heavily influenced by the work of [[John Backus]] on [[functional programming]] (FP) languages.<ref name=renotes/>\n\nCraig ported his original Atari implementation to the 16-bit [[DOS]] platform and Euphoria was first released, version 1.0, in July 1993<ref name=firstversion/> under a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] licence. The original Atari implementation is described by Craig as \"primitive\"<ref name=atari2/> and has not been publicly released. Euphoria continued to be developed and released by Craig via his company Rapid Deployment Software (RDS) and website rapideuphoria.com.<ref name=rehomepage/> In October 2006 RDS released version 3<ref name=opensource/> of Euphoria and announced that henceforth Euphoria would be freely distributed under an [[open-source software]] licence.\n\nRDS continued to develop Euphoria, culminating with the release of version 3.1.1 in August, 2007.<ref name=renotes/><ref name=renews/> Subsequently, RDS ceased unilateral development of Euphoria and the openEuphoria Group<ref name=oehomepage/> took over ongoing development. The openEuphoria Group released version 4 in December, 2010<ref name=oenotes/> along with a new logo and mascot for the openEuphoria project.\n\nVersion 3.1.1 remains an important milestone release, being the last version of Euphoria which supports the [[DOS]] platform.<ref name=oeplatform/>\n\nEuphoria is an [[acronym]] for ''End-User Programming with Hierarchical Objects for Robust Interpreted Applications'' although there is some suspicion that this is a [[backronym]].{{according to whom|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe Euphoria interpreter was originally written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. With the release of version 2.5<ref name=renotes/> in November 2004 the Euphoria interpreter was split into two parts: a front-end parser, and a back-end interpreter. The front-end is now written in Euphoria (and used with the Euphoria-to-C translator and the Binder). The main back-end and run time library are written in C.\n\n==Features==\nEuphoria was conceived and developed with the following design goals and features:\n\n* Ease of learning and with consistent high-level constructs (more so than e.g., the [[BASIC]] language)\n* Implementation of flat-form 32-bit memory to avoid complex memory management and size-addressing limits\n* Debugging support and run-time error-handling\n* Subscript and [[Type system|type checking]]\n* Loose and strict variable typing\n* Programming via objects as types (user-defined or otherwise)\n* Interpreted, with automatic memory management and [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]]\n* Heterogeneous collection types (sequences)\n* [[DOS]] graphics library (Euphoria language versions up to and including 3.1.1)\n* Debugger\n* Integrated database system\n* Low-level memory handling\n* Straightforward [[wrapper function|wrapping]] of (or access to) [[C (programming language)|C]] libraries\n\n==Execution modes==\n* [[Interpreter (computing)|Interpreter]]\n* [[C (programming language)|C]] translator (E2C) for standalone executables or [[Dynamic linker|dynamic linking]]\n* [[Bytecode]] compiler and interpreter (shrouder<ref name=binding/>)\n* The Binder<ref name=binding/> binds the Euphoria source code to the interpreter to create an executable.\n* A [[read\u2013eval\u2013print loop]] (REPL) version is on the openEuphoria [[technology roadmap|roadmap]].<ref name=repl/>\n\n==Use==\nEuphoria is designed to readily facilitate handling of dynamic sets of data of varying types and is particularly useful for string and image processing. Euphoria has been used in [[artificial intelligence]] experiments, the study of [[mathematics]], for teaching programming, and to implement fonts involving thousands of characters.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} A large part of the Euphoria interpreter is written in Euphoria.\n\n==Data types==\nEuphoria has two basic data types:\n:Atom \u2013 A number, implemented as a 31-bit signed [[integer]] or a 64-bit [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE floating-point]]. Euphoria dynamically changes between integer and floating point representation according to the current value.\n:Sequence \u2013 A [[Array data type|vector]] (array) with zero or more elements. Each element may be an ''atom'' or another ''sequence''. The number of elements in a sequence is not fixed (i.e., the size of the vector/array does not have to be declared). The program may add or remove elements as needed during run-time. Memory allocation-deallocation is automatically handled by reference counting. Individual elements are referenced using an index value enclosed in square brackets. The first element in a sequence has an index of one [1]. Elements inside embedded sequences are referenced by additional bracked index values, thus X[3][2] refers to the second element contained in the sequence that is the third element of X. Each element of a sequence is an ''object'' type (see below).\n\nEuphoria has two additional data types predefined:\n:Integer \u2013 An ''atom'', restricted to 31-bit signed [[integer]] values in the range -1073741824 to 1073741823 (-2^30 to 2^30-1). ''Integer'' data types are more efficient than the ''atom'' data types, but cannot contain the same range of values. Characters are stored as integers, e.g., coding [[ASCII]]-'A' is exactly the same as coding 65.\n:Object \u2013 A generic datatype which may contain any of the above (i.e., ''atom'', ''sequence'' or ''integer'') and which may be changed to another type during run-time.\n\nThere is no character [[String (computer science)|string]] data type. Strings are represented by a ''sequence'' of ''integer'' values. However, because literal strings are so commonly used in programming, Euphoria interprets double-quote enclosed characters as a sequence of integers. Thus\n \"ABC\"\nis seen as if the coder had written:\n {'A', 'B', 'C'}\nwhich is the same as:\n {65, 66, 67}\n\n==Hello, World!==\n puts(1, \"Hello, World!\\n\")\n\n==Examples==\nProgram comments start with a double hyphen <code>--</code> and go through the end of line.\n\nThe following code looks for an old item in a group of items. If found, it removes it by concatenating all the elements before it with all the elements after it.

As the variables ''old'' and ''new'' have been defined as objects, they could be ''atoms'' or ''sequences''. Type checking is not needed as the function will work with any sequence of data of any type and needs no external libraries.\n\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">global function</span> replace_item( <span style=\"color:magenta;\">object</span> old, <span style=\"color:magenta;\">object</span> new, <span style=\"color:magenta;\">sequence</span> group )\n    <span style=\"color:magenta;\">integer</span> pos\n              <span style=\"color:red;\">-- Code begins --</span>\n    pos = <span style=\"color:magenta;\">find</span>( old, group )\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">if</span> pos > 0 <span style=\"color:blue;\">then</span>\n        group[pos] = new\n    <span style=\"color:blue;\">end if\n    return</span> group\n <span style=\"color:blue;\">end function</span>\n\nFurthermore, no pointers are involved and subscripts are automatically checked.

However, parameters are allowed to be modified ''locally'' (i.e., within the callee) which is implemented very efficiently as sequences have automatic [[copy-on-write]] semantics. In other words, when you pass a sequence to a routine, initially only a reference to it is passed, but at the point the routine modifies this sequence parameter the sequence is copied and the routine updates only a copy of the original.\n\n==Comparable languages==\n* [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]\n* [http://phix.x10.mx Phix]\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]\n* [[REBOL]]\n* [[Ruby

The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of energy is the [[joule]], which is the energy transferred to an object by the [[work (physics)|work]] of moving it a distance of 1 [[metre]] against a [[force]] of 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]].\n\nCommon forms of energy include the [[kinetic energy]] of a moving object, the [[potential energy]] stored by an object's position in a force [[Classical field theory|field]] ([[gravitational field|gravitational]], [[electric field|electric]] or [[magnetic field|magnetic]]), the [[elastic energy]] stored by stretching solid objects, the [[chemical energy]] released when a fuel [[combustion|burns]], the [[radiant energy]] carried by light, and the [[thermal energy]] due to an object's [[temperature]].\n\n[[Mass]] and energy are closely related. Due to [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], any object that has mass when stationary (called [[rest mass]]) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called [[rest mass#Rest energy|rest energy]], and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough [[weighing scale|scale]].\n\nLiving organisms require [[available energy]] to stay alive, such as the [[Food energy|energy humans get from food]].  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  [[energy resource]]s such as [[fossil fuel]]s, [[nuclear fuel]], or [[renewable energy]]. The processes of Earth's [[climate]] and [[ecosystem]] are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the [[geothermal energy]] contained within the earth.\n\n==Forms==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2016}}\n\n[[File:Lightning over Oradea Romania zoom.jpg|thumb|In a typical [[lightning]] strike, 500 [[megajoule]]s of [[electric potential energy]] is converted into the same amount of energy in other forms, mostly [[light energy]], [[sound energy]] and [[thermal energy]].]]\n[[File:Hot metalwork.jpg|thumb|[[Thermal energy]] is energy of microscopic constituents of matter, which may include both [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential energy]].]]\n\nThe total energy of a [[system]] can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. [[Kinetic energy]] is determined by the [[motion (physics)|movement]] of an object -- or the [[statistical mechanics|composite motion]] of the components of an object - and [[potential energy]] reflects the potential of an object to have motion, and generally is a function of the position of an object within a [[Field (physics)|field]] or may stored in the field itself.\n\nWhile these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form. For example, macroscopic [[mechanical energy]] is the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy in a system neglects the kinetic energy due to temperature, and nuclear energy which combines utilize potentials from the [[nuclear force]] and the [[weak force]]), among others.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\n{{Forms of energy}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of energy|timeline of thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and random processes|}}\n[[File:Thomas Young (scientist).jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] \u2013 the first to use the term \"energy\" in the modern sense.]]\nThe word ''energy'' derives from the {{lang-grc|\u1f10\u03bd\u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1|[[energeia]]|activity, operation}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |title=Energy |work=Online Etymology Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |accessdate=May 1, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011122441/http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=energy |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |df= }}</ref> which possibly appears for the first time in the work of [[Aristotle]] in the 4th century BC. In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept, broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.\n\nIn the late 17th century, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] proposed the idea of the {{lang-lat|[[vis viva]]}}, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total ''vis viva'' was conserved. To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the random motion of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted. The modern analog of this property, [[kinetic energy]], differs from ''vis viva'' only by a factor of two.\n\nIn 1807, [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] was possibly the first to use the term \"energy\" instead of ''vis viva'', in its modern sense.<ref>{{Cite book| last = Smith | first = Crosbie | title = The Science of Energy \u2013 a Cultural History of Energy Physics in Victorian Britain | publisher = The University of Chicago Press | year = 1998 | isbn = 0-226-76420-6}}</ref> [[Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis]] described \"[[kinetic energy]]\" in 1829 in its modern sense, and in 1853, [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]] coined the term \"[[potential energy]]\". The law of [[conservation of energy]] was also first postulated in the early 19th century, and applies to any [[isolated system]]. It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the [[caloric theory|caloric]], or merely a physical quantity, such as [[momentum]]. In 1845 [[James Prescott Joule]] discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.\n\nThese developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson ([[Lord Kelvin]]) as the field of [[thermodynamics]]. Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], and [[Walther Nernst]]. It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of [[entropy]] by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of [[radiant energy]] by [[Jo\u017eef Stefan]]. According to [[Noether's theorem]], the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.<ref name=\"jphysics\">{{Cite book| last =Lofts| first =G|author2=O'Keeffe D |display-authors=etal | title=Jacaranda Physics 1| publisher =John Willey & Sons Australia Ltd. | year =2004| location = Milton, Queensland, Australia| page = 286| chapter=11 \u2014 Mechanical Interactions| edition=2| isbn=0-7016-3777-3}}</ref> Thus, since 1918, theorists have understood that the law of [[conservation of energy]] is the direct mathematical consequence of the [[translational symmetry]] of the quantity [[conjugate variables|conjugate]] to energy, namely time.\n\n==Units of measure==\n[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|Joule's apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]\n{{Main article|Units of energy}}\n\nIn 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. The most famous of them used the \"Joule apparatus\": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer. It showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.\n\nIn the [[International System of Units]] (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after James Prescott Joule. It is a [[SI derived unit|derived unit]]. It is equal to the energy expended (or [[Work (physics)|work]] done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre. However energy is also expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as [[erg]]s, [[calorie]]s, [[British Thermal Unit]]s, [[kilowatt-hour]]s and [[kilocalorie]]s, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.\n\nThe SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the [[watt]], which is a joule per second.  Thus, one joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one watt-hour.  The [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] energy unit is the [[erg]] and the [[imperial and US customary measurement systems|imperial and US customary]] unit is the [[foot pound]]. Other energy units such as the [[electronvolt]], [[food calorie]] or thermodynamic [[kilocalorie|kcal]] (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process), and [[British thermal unit|BTU]] are used in specific areas of science and commerce.\n\n==Scientific use==\n\n===Classical mechanics===\n{{Classical mechanics}}\n{{Main article|Mechanics|Mechanical work|Thermodynamics}}\n\nIn classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a [[conserved quantity]]. Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.\n\n[[Work (physics)|Work]], a function of energy, is force times distance.\n\n: <math> W = \\int_C \\mathbf{F} \\cdot \\mathrm{d} \\mathbf{s}</math>\n\nThis says that the work (<math>W</math>) is equal to the [[line integral]] of the [[force]] '''F''' along a path ''C''; for details see the [[mechanical work]] article. Work and thus energy is [[frame dependent]]. For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat. In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball. But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.\n\nThe total energy of a system is sometimes called the [[Hamilton's equations|Hamiltonian]], after [[William Rowan Hamilton]]. The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems. These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071011135413/http://www.sustech.edu/OCWExternal/Akamai/18/18.013a/textbook/HTML/chapter16/section03.html The Hamiltonian] MIT OpenCourseWare website 18.013A Chapter 16.3 Accessed February 2007</ref>\n\nAnother energy-related concept is called the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], after [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]. This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian, and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them. It was invented in the context of [[classical mechanics]], but is generally useful in modern physics. The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy ''minus'' the potential energy. Usually, the Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).\n\n[[Noether's theorem]] (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law. Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations. A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833, respectively), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangian; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.\n\n===Chemistry===<!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (chemistry)]] links here -->\nIn the context of [[Chemistry#Energy|chemistry]], energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure. Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is invariably accompanied by an increase or decrease of energy of the substances involved. Some energy is transferred between the surroundings and the reactants of the reaction in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction may have more or less energy than the reactants. A reaction is said to be [[exergonic]] if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of [[endergonic]] reactions the situation is the reverse. [[Chemical reaction]]s are invariably not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the [[activation energy]]. The ''speed'' of a chemical reaction (at given temperature&nbsp;''T'') is related to the activation energy&nbsp;''E'', by the Boltzmann's population factor&nbsp;e<sup>\u2212''E''/''kT''</sup>{{spaced ndash}}that is the probability of molecule to have energy greater than or equal to&nbsp;''E'' at the given temperature&nbsp;''T''. This exponential dependence of a reaction rate on temperature is known as the [[Arrhenius equation]].The activation energy necessary for a chemical reaction can be in the form of thermal energy.\n\n===Biology===<!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (biology)]] links here -->\n{{Main article|Bioenergetics|Food energy}}\n[[File:Energy and life.svg|thumb|Basic overview of [[Bioenergetics|energy and human life]].]]\n{{anchor|Biology}}In [[biology#Energy|biology]], energy is an attribute of all biological systems from the biosphere to the smallest living [[organism]]. Within an organism it is responsible for growth and development of a biological [[Cell (biology)|cell]] or an [[organelle]] of a biological [[organism]]. Energy is thus often said to be stored by [[Cell (biology)|cells]] in the structures of molecules of substances such as [[carbohydrate]]s (including sugars), [[lipid]]s, and [[protein]]s, which release energy when reacted with [[oxygen]] in [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]]. In human terms, the [[human equivalent]] (H-e) (Human energy conversion) indicates, for a given amount of energy expenditure, the relative quantity of energy needed for human [[metabolism]], assuming an average human energy expenditure of 12,500&nbsp;kJ per day and a [[basal metabolic rate]] of 80 watts. For example, if our bodies run (on average) at 80 watts, then a light bulb running at 100 watts is running at 1.25 human equivalents (100 \u00f7 80) i.e. 1.25 H-e. For a difficult task of only a few seconds' duration, a person can put out thousands of watts, many times the 746 watts in one official horsepower. For tasks lasting a few minutes, a fit human can generate perhaps 1,000 watts. For an activity that must be sustained for an hour, output drops to around 300; for an activity kept up all day, 150 watts is about the maximum.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |title=Retrieved on May-29-09 |publisher=Uic.edu |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604191319/http://www.uic.edu/aa/college/gallery400/notions/human%20energy.htm |archivedate=2010-06-04 |df= }}</ref> The human equivalent assists understanding of energy flows in physical and biological systems by expressing energy units in human terms: it provides a \"feel\" for the use of a given amount of energy.<ref>Bicycle calculator - speed, weight, wattage etc. {{cite web |url=http://bikecalculator.com/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513091201/http://bikecalculator.com/ |archivedate=2009-05-13 |df= }}.</ref>\n\nSunlight's radiant energy is also captured by plants as ''chemical potential energy'' in [[photosynthesis]], when carbon dioxide and water (two low-energy compounds) are converted into the high-energy compounds carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Plants also release oxygen during photosynthesis, which is utilized by living organisms as an [[electron acceptor]], to release the energy of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Release of the energy stored during photosynthesis as heat or light may be triggered suddenly by a spark, in a forest fire, or it may be made available more slowly for animal or human metabolism, when these molecules are ingested, and [[catabolism]] is triggered by [[enzyme]] action.\n\nAny living organism relies on an external source of energy\u2014radiant energy from the Sun in the case of green plants, chemical energy in some form in the case of animals\u2014to be able to grow and reproduce.

In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\"the surroundings\").<ref group=note>[[Crystal]]s are another example of highly ordered systems that exist in nature: in this case too, the order is associated with the transfer of a large amount of heat (known as the [[lattice energy]]) to the surroundings.</ref> Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy [[ecological niche]]s that are not available to their simpler brethren.

Sunlight also drives many weather phenomena, save those generated by volcanic events. An example of a solar-mediated weather event is a hurricane, which occurs when large unstable areas of warm ocean, heated over months, give up some of their thermal energy suddenly to power a few days of violent air movement.\n\nIn a slower process, [[radioactive decay]] of atoms in the core of the Earth releases heat. This thermal energy drives [[plate tectonics]] and may lift mountains, via [[orogenesis]]. This slow lifting represents a kind of gravitational potential energy storage of the thermal energy, which may be later released to active kinetic energy in landslides, after a triggering event. Earthquakes also release stored elastic potential energy in rocks, a store that has been produced ultimately from the same radioactive heat sources. Thus, according to present understanding, familiar events such as landslides and earthquakes release energy that has been stored as potential energy in the Earth's gravitational field or elastic strain (mechanical potential energy) in rocks. Prior to this, they represent release of energy that has been stored in heavy atoms since the collapse of long-destroyed supernova stars created these atoms.\n\n===Cosmology===<!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: redirect [[Energy (cosmology)]] links here -->\nIn [[Physical cosmology#Energy of the cosmos|cosmology and astronomy]] the phenomena of [[star]]s, [[nova]], [[supernova]], [[quasar]]s and [[gamma-ray burst]]s are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All [[wikt:stellar|stellar]] phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The [[nuclear fusion]] of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the [[Big Bang]]. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.\n\n{{anchor|Physics}}<!-- courtesy note per [[WP:LINK2SECT]]: [[Energy (physics) links here]] -->\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\n{{Main article|Energy operator}}\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], energy is defined in terms of the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|energy operator]]\nas a time derivative of the [[wave function]]. The [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] equates the energy operator to the full energy of a particle or a system. Its results can be considered as a definition of measurement of energy in quantum mechanics. The Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the space- and time-dependence of a slowly changing (non-relativistic) [[wave function]] of quantum systems. The solution of this equation for a bound system is discrete (a set of permitted states, each characterized by an [[energy level]]) which results in the concept of [[quantum|quanta]]. In the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for any oscillator (vibrator) and for electromagnetic waves in a vacuum, the resulting energy states are related to the frequency by [[Planck's relation]]: <math>E = h\\nu</math> (where <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]] and <math>\\nu</math> the frequency). In the case of an electromagnetic wave these energy states are called quanta of light or [[photon]]s.\n\n===Relativity===\nWhen calculating kinetic energy ([[Mechanical work|work]] to accelerate a [[mass|massive body]] from zero [[speed]] to some finite speed) relativistically \u2013 using [[Lorentz transformations]] instead of [[Newtonian mechanics]] \u2013 Einstein discovered an unexpected by-product of these calculations to be an energy term which does not vanish at zero speed. He called it [[rest energy]]: energy which every massive body must possess even when being at rest. The amount of energy is directly proportional to the mass of the body:\n\n:<math> E_0 = m c^2 </math>,\nwhere\n:''m'' is the mass of the body,\n:''c'' is the [[speed of light]] in vacuum,\n:''<math>E_0</math>'' is the rest energy.\n\nFor example, consider [[electron]]\u2013[[positron]] annihilation, in which the rest energy of these two individual particles (equivalent to their [[invariant mass|rest mass]]) is converted to the radiant energy of the photons produced in the process. In this system the [[matter]] and [[antimatter]] (electrons and positrons) are destroyed and changed to non-matter (the photons). However, the total mass and total energy do not change during this interaction. The photons each have no rest mass but nonetheless have radiant energy which exhibits the same inertia as did the two original particles.  This is a reversible process \u2013 the inverse process is called [[pair creation]] \u2013 in which the rest mass of particles is created from the radiant energy of two (or more) annihilating photons.\n\nIn general relativity, the [[stress\u2013energy tensor]] serves as the source term for the gravitational field, in rough analogy to the way mass serves as the source term in the non-relativistic Newtonian approximation.<ref name=\"MTW\"/>\n\nEnergy and mass are manifestations of one and the same underlying physical property of a system.  This property is responsible for the inertia and strength of gravitational interaction of the system (\"mass manifestations\"), and is also responsible for the potential ability of the system to perform work or heating (\"energy manifestations\"), subject to the limitations of other physical laws.\n\nIn [[classical physics]], energy is a scalar quantity, the [[canonical conjugate]] to time. In [[special relativity]] energy is also a scalar (although not a [[Lorentz scalar]] but a time component of the [[energy\u2013momentum 4-vector]]).<ref name=\"MTW\">{{Cite book|author=Misner, Thorne, Wheeler |title=Gravitation |year=1973 |publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=San Francisco |isbn=0-7167-0344-0}}</ref> In other words, energy is invariant with respect to rotations of [[space]], but not invariant with respect to rotations of [[space-time]] (= [[Lorentz boost|boosts]]).\n\n==Transformation==\n{{Main article|Energy transformation}}\n\n{{Forms of energy transfer}}\n[[File:Turbogenerator01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35| A [[turbo generator]] transforms the energy of pressurised steam into electrical energy]]\nEnergy may be [[energy transformation|transformed]] between different forms at various [[energy conversion efficiency|efficiencies]]. Items that transform between these forms are called [[transducer]]s. Examples of transducers include a battery, from [[chemical energy]] to [[electric energy]]; a dam: [[gravitational potential energy]] to [[kinetic energy]] of moving water (and the blades of a [[turbine]]) and ultimately to [[electric energy]] through an [[electric generator]]; or a [[heat engine]], from heat to work.\n\nExamples of energy transformation include generating [[electric energy]] from heat energy via a steam turbine, or lifting an object against gravity using electrical energy driving a crane motor. Lifting against gravity performs mechanical work on the object and stores gravitational potential energy in the object. If the object falls to the ground, gravity does mechanical work on the object which transforms the potential energy in the gravitational field to the kinetic energy released as heat on impact with the ground. Our Sun transforms [[nuclear potential energy]] to other forms of energy; its total mass does not decrease due to that in itself (since it still contains the same total energy even if in different forms), but its mass does decrease when the energy escapes out to its surroundings, largely as [[radiant energy]].\n\nThere are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into [[Work (physics)|work]] in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot's theorem]] and the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by [[entropy]] (equal energy spread among all available [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.\n\nEnergy transformations in the universe over time are characterized by various kinds of potential energy that has been available since the [[Big Bang]] later being \"released\" (transformed to more active types of energy such as kinetic or radiant energy) when a triggering mechanism is available. Familiar examples of such processes include nuclear decay, in which energy is released that was originally \"stored\" in heavy isotopes (such as [[uranium]] and [[thorium]]), by [[nucleosynthesis]], a process ultimately using the gravitational potential energy released from the [[gravitational collapse]] of [[supernova]]e, to store energy in the creation of these heavy elements before they were incorporated into the solar system and the Earth. This energy is triggered and released in nuclear [[fission bomb]]s or in civil nuclear power generation. Similarly, in the case of a [[Chemical explosive|chemical explosion]], [[chemical potential]] energy is transformed to [[kinetic energy]] and [[thermal energy]] in a very short time. Yet another example is that of a [[pendulum]]. At its highest points the [[kinetic energy]] is zero and the [[gravitational potential energy]] is at maximum. At its lowest point the [[kinetic energy]] is at maximum and is equal to the decrease of [[potential energy]]. If one (unrealistically) assumes that there is no [[friction]] or other losses, the conversion of energy between these processes would be perfect, and the [[pendulum]] would continue swinging forever.\n\nEnergy is also transferred from potential energy (<math>E_p</math>) to kinetic energy (<math>E_k</math>) and then back to potential energy constantly. This is referred to as conservation of energy. In this closed system, energy cannot be created or destroyed; therefore, the initial energy and the final energy will be equal to each other. This can be demonstrated by the following:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>E_{pi} + E_{ki} = E_{pF} + E_{kF}</math>|{{EquationRef|4}}}}\n\nThe equation can then be simplified further since <math>E_p = mgh</math> (mass times acceleration due to gravity times the height) and <math>E_k = \\frac{1}{2} mv^2</math> (half&nbsp;mass times velocity squared). Then the total amount of energy can be found by adding <math>E_p + E_k = E_{total}</math>.\n\n===Conservation of energy and mass in transformation===\nEnergy gives rise to weight when it is trapped in a system with zero momentum, where it can be weighed. It is also equivalent to mass, and this mass is always associated with it. Mass is also equivalent to a certain amount of energy, and likewise always appears associated with it, as described in [[mass-energy equivalence]]. The formula ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''\u00b2, derived by [[Albert Einstein]] (1905) quantifies the relationship between rest-mass and rest-energy within the concept of special relativity. In different theoretical frameworks, similar formulas were derived by [[J. J. Thomson]] (1881), [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] (1900), [[Friedrich Hasen\u00f6hrl]] (1904) and others (see [[Mass-energy equivalence#History]] for further information).\n\nPart of the rest energy (equivalent to rest mass) of [[matter]] may be converted to other forms of energy (still exhibiting mass), but neither energy nor mass can be destroyed; rather, both remain constant during any process. However, since <math>c^2</math> is extremely large relative to ordinary human scales, the conversion of an everyday amount of rest mass (for example, 1&nbsp;kg) from rest energy to other forms of energy (such as kinetic energy, thermal energy, or the radiant energy carried by light and other radiation) can liberate tremendous amounts of energy (~<math>9\\times 10^{16}</math> joules = 21 megatons of TNT), as can be seen in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. Conversely, the mass equivalent of an everyday amount energy is minuscule, which is why a loss of energy (loss of mass) from most systems is difficult to measure on a weighing scale, unless the energy loss is very large. Examples of large transformations between rest energy (of matter) and other forms of energy (e.g., kinetic energy into particles with rest mass) are found in [[nuclear physics]] and [[particle physics]].\n\n===Reversible and non-reversible transformations===\nThermodynamics divides energy transformation into two kinds: [[Reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible processes]] and [[irreversible process]]es. An irreversible process is one in which energy is dissipated (spread) into empty energy states available in a volume, from which it cannot be recovered into more concentrated forms (fewer quantum states), without degradation of even more energy. A reversible process is one in which this sort of dissipation does not happen. For example, conversion of energy from one type of potential field to another, is reversible, as in the pendulum system described above. In processes where heat is generated, quantum states of lower energy, present as possible excitations in fields between atoms, act as a reservoir for part of the energy, from which it cannot be recovered, in order to be converted with 100% efficiency into other forms of energy. In this case, the energy must partly stay as heat, and cannot be completely recovered as usable energy, except at the price of an increase in some other kind of heat-like increase in disorder in quantum states, in the universe (such as an expansion of matter, or a randomisation in a crystal).\n\nAs the universe evolves in time, more and more of its energy becomes trapped in irreversible states (i.e., as heat or other kinds of increases in disorder). This has been referred to as the inevitable thermodynamic [[heat death of the universe]]. In this heat death the energy of the universe does not change, but the fraction of energy which is available to do work through a [[heat engine]], or be transformed to other usable forms of energy (through the use of generators attached to heat engines), grows less and less.\n\n==Conservation of energy==\n{{Main article|Conservation of energy}}\nThe fact that energy can be neither created nor be destroyed is called the law of [[conservation of energy]].  In the form of the [[first law of thermodynamics]], this states that a [[closed system]]'s energy is constant unless energy is transferred in or out by [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] or [[heat]], and that no energy is lost in transfer. The total inflow of energy into a system must equal the total outflow of energy from the system, plus the change in the energy contained within the system. Whenever one measures (or calculates) the total energy of a system of particles whose interactions do not depend explicitly on time, it is found that the total energy of the system always remains constant.<ref>Berkeley Physics Course Volume 1. Charles Kittel, Walter D Knight and Malvin A Ruderman</ref>\n\nWhile heat can always be fully converted into work in a reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, for cyclic processes of practical interest in [[heat engine]]s the [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the system doing work always loses some energy as [[waste heat]]. This creates a limit to the amount of heat energy that can do work in a cyclic process, a limit called the [[available energy]]. Mechanical and other forms of energy can be transformed in the other direction into [[thermal energy]] without such limitations.<ref name=\"thermo-laws\"/> The total energy of a system can be calculated by adding up all forms of energy in the system.\n\n[[Richard Feynman]] said during a 1961 lecture:<ref name=\"RPF1\"/>\n{{quote|There is a fact, or if you wish, a ''law'', governing all natural phenomena that are known to date. There is no known exception to this law\u2014it is exact so far as we know. The law is called the ''[[conservation of energy]]''. It states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change when something happens. It is not a description of a mechanism, or anything concrete; it is just a strange fact that we can calculate some number and when we finish watching nature go through her tricks and calculate the number again, it is the same.|''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''}}\n\nMost kinds of energy (with gravitational energy being a notable exception)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.ucla.edu/~cwp/articles/noether.asg/noether.html |title=E.

In this case, energy can only be exchanged between adjacent regions of space, and all observers agree as to the volumetric density of energy in any given space.

Put differently, yesterday, today, and tomorrow are physically indistinguishable. This is because energy is the quantity which is [[canonical conjugate]] to time. This mathematical entanglement of energy and time also results in the uncertainty principle - it is impossible to define the exact amount of energy during any definite time interval. The uncertainty principle should not be confused with energy conservation - rather it provides mathematical limits to which energy can in principle be defined and measured.\n\nEach of the basic forces of nature is associated with a different type of potential energy, and all types of potential energy (like all other types of energy) appears as system [[mass]], whenever present. For example, a compressed spring will be slightly more massive than before it was compressed. Likewise, whenever energy is transferred between systems by any mechanism, an associated mass is transferred with it.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]] energy is expressed using the Hamiltonian [[Operator (physics)|operator]]. On any time scales, the uncertainty in the energy is by\n\n: <math>\\Delta E \\Delta t \\ge \\frac { \\hbar } {2 } </math>\n\nwhich is similar in form to the [[Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle]] (but not really mathematically equivalent thereto, since ''H'' and ''t'' are not dynamically conjugate variables, neither in classical nor in quantum mechanics).\n\nIn [[particle physics]], this inequality permits a qualitative understanding of [[virtual particles]] which carry [[momentum]], exchange by which and with real particles, is responsible for the creation of all known [[fundamental forces]] (more accurately known as [[fundamental interactions]]). [[Virtual photons]] (which are simply lowest quantum mechanical [[energy state]] of [[photon]]s) are also responsible for electrostatic interaction between [[electric charge]]s (which results in [[Coulomb law]]), for [[Spontaneous fission|spontaneous]] radiative decay of exited atomic and nuclear states, for the [[Casimir force]], for [[van der Waals force|van der Waals bond forces]] and some other observable phenomena.\n\n==Energy transfer==\n===Closed systems===\nEnergy transfer can be considered for the special case of systems which are [[closed system|closed]] to transfers of matter. The portion of the energy which is transferred by [[conservative force]]s over a distance is measured as the [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] the source system does on the receiving system. The portion of the energy which does not do work during the transfer is called [[heat]].<ref group=note>Although heat is \"wasted\" energy for a specific energy transfer,(see: [[waste heat]]) it can often be harnessed to do useful work in subsequent interactions. However, the maximum energy that can be \"recycled\" from such recovery processes is limited by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].</ref> Energy can be transferred between systems in a variety of ways. Examples include the transmission of [[electromagnetic energy]] via photons, physical collisions which transfer [[kinetic energy]],<ref group=note>The mechanism for most macroscopic physical collisions is actually [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], but it is very common to simplify the interaction by ignoring the mechanism of collision and just calculate the beginning and end result.</ref> and the conductive transfer of [[thermal energy]].\n\nEnergy is strictly conserved and is also locally conserved wherever it can be defined. In thermodynamics, for closed systems, the process of energy transfer is described by the [[first law of thermodynamics|first law]]:<ref group=note>There are several [[First law of thermodynamics#Description|sign conventions for this equation]].

Denoting this energy by <math>E</math>, one may write\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\\Delta{}E = W + Q + E .</math>|{{EquationRef|3}}}}\n\n==Thermodynamics==\n\n===Internal energy===\n[[Internal energy]] is the sum of all microscopic forms of energy of a system. It is the energy needed to create the system. It is related to the potential energy, e.g., molecular structure, crystal structure, and other geometric aspects, as well as the motion of the particles, in form of kinetic energy. Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with changes in internal energy and not its absolute value, which is impossible to determine with thermodynamics alone.<ref name=klotz>I. Klotz, R. Rosenberg, ''Chemical Thermodynamics - Basic Concepts and Methods'', 7th ed., Wiley (2008), p.39</ref>\n\n===First law of thermodynamics===\nThe [[first law of thermodynamics]] asserts that energy (but not necessarily [[thermodynamic free energy]]) is always conserved<ref name=\"KK\">{{Cite book|author=Kittel and Kroemer|title=Thermal Physics |year=1980|publisher=W. H. Freeman |location=New York| isbn=0-7167-1088-9}}</ref> and that heat flow is a form of energy transfer. For homogeneous systems, with a well-defined temperature and pressure, a commonly used corollary of the first law is that, for a system subject only to [[pressure]] forces and heat transfer (e.g., a cylinder-full of gas) without chemical changes, the differential change in the internal energy of the system (with a ''gain'' in energy signified by a positive quantity) is given as\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{d}E = T\\mathrm{d}S - P\\mathrm{d}V\\,</math>,\n\nwhere the first term on the right is the heat transferred into the system, expressed in terms of [[temperature]] ''T'' and [[entropy]] ''S'' (in which entropy increases and the change d''S'' is positive when the system is heated), and the last term on the right hand side is identified as work done on the system, where pressure is ''P'' and volume ''V'' (the negative sign results since compression of the system requires work to be done on it and so the volume change, d''V'', is negative when work is done on the system).\n\nThis equation is highly specific, ignoring all chemical, electrical, nuclear, and gravitational forces, effects such as [[advection]] of any form of energy other than heat and pV-work. The general formulation of the first law (i.e., conservation of energy) is valid even in situations in which the system is not homogeneous. For these cases the change in internal energy of a ''closed'' system is expressed in a general form by\n\n:<math>\\mathrm{d}E=\\delta Q+\\delta W</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\delta Q</math> is the heat supplied to the system and <math>\\delta W</math> is the work applied to the system.\n\n===Equipartition of energy===\nThe energy of a mechanical [[harmonic oscillator]] (a mass on a spring) is alternatively [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] and [[potential]]. At two points in the oscillation [[Frequency|cycle]] it is entirely kinetic, and at two points it is entirely potential. Over the whole cycle, or over many cycles, net energy is thus equally split between kinetic and potential. This is called [[equipartition principle]]; total energy of a system with many degrees of freedom is equally split among all available degrees of freedom.\n\nThis principle is vitally important to understanding the behaviour of a quantity closely related to energy, called [[entropy]]. Entropy is a measure of evenness of a [[distribution (mathematics)|distribution]] of energy between parts of a system. When an isolated system is given more degrees of freedom (i.e., given new available [[energy state]]s that are the same as existing states), then total energy spreads over all available degrees equally without distinction between \"new\" and \"old\" degrees. This mathematical result is called the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. The second law of thermodynamics is valid only for systems which are near or in [[equilibrium state]]. For non-equilibrium systems, the laws governing system\u2019s behavior are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the principle of [[principle of maximum entropy|maximum entropy production]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Onsager|first1=L.|title=Reciprocal relations in irreversible processes.|journal=Phys.

For example, the expected value in rolling a six-sided [[dice|<!--THERE IS-->d<!--NO LETTER C-->i<!--IN THE SINGULAR-->e<!--OF 'DICE'-->]] is 3.5, because the average of all the numbers that come up in an extremely large number of rolls is close to 3.5. Less roughly, the [[law of large numbers]] states that the [[arithmetic mean]] of the values [[almost surely]] converges to the expected value as the number of repetitions approaches infinity. The expected value is also known as the '''expectation''', '''mathematical expectation''', '''EV''', '''average''', '''mean value''', '''mean''', or '''first moment'''.\n\nMore practically, the expected value of a [[discrete random variable]] is the [[Weighted average|probability-weighted average]] of all possible values. In other words, each possible value the random variable can assume is multiplied by its probability of occurring, and the resulting products are summed to produce the expected value. The same principle applies to an [[absolute continuity#Absolute continuity of measures|absolutely continuous]] random variable, except that an [[Lebesgue integral|integral]] of the variable with respect to its [[Probability density function|probability density]] replaces the sum. The formal definition subsumes both of these and also works for distributions which are  neither discrete nor absolutely continuous; the expected value of a random variable is the integral of the random variable with respect to its [[probability measure]].<ref name=Ross>{{cite book |title=Introduction to probability models |author=Sheldon M Ross |edition=9th |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-598062-0 |year=2007 |chapter=\u00a72.4 Expectation of a random variable |page=38 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=12Pk5zZFirEC&pg=PA38 }}</ref><ref name=Hamming>{{cite book |title=The art of probability for scientists and engineers |author=[[Richard W Hamming]] |chapter=\u00a72.5 Random variables, mean and the expected value |page=64 ''ff'' |publisher=Addison\u2013Wesley |year=1991 |isbn=0-201-40686-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jX_F-77TA3gC&pg=PA64 }}</ref>\n\nThe expected value does not exist for random variables having some [[probability distribution|distributions]] with [[Heavy-tailed distribution|large \"tails\"]], such as the [[Cauchy distribution]].<ref name=Hamming2>{{cite book |title=The art of probability for scientists and engineers |author=[[Richard W Hamming]] |chapter=Example 8.7\u20131 The Cauchy distribution |page=290 ''ff'' |publisher=Addison-Wesley |year=1991 |isbn=0-201-40686-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jX_F-77TA3gC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=Cauchy |quote=Sampling from the Cauchy distribution and averaging gets you nowhere \u2014 one sample has the same distribution as the average of 1000 samples!}}</ref>  For random variables such as these, the long-tails of the distribution prevent the sum or integral from converging.\n\nThe expected value is a key aspect of how one characterizes a [[probability distribution]]; it is one type of [[location parameter]]. By contrast, the [[variance]] is a measure of [[Statistical dispersion|dispersion]] of the possible values of the random variable around the expected value. The variance itself is defined in terms of two expectations: it is the expected value of the squared deviation of the variable's value from the variable's expected value.\n\nThe expected value plays important roles in a variety of contexts. In [[regression analysis]], one desires a formula in terms of observed data that will give a \"good\" estimate of the parameter giving the effect of some [[explanatory variable]] upon a [[dependent variable]]. The formula will give different estimates using different samples of data, so the estimate it gives is itself a random variable. A formula is typically considered good in this context if it is an [[unbiased estimator]]&mdash; that is if the expected value of the estimate (the average value it would give over an arbitrarily large number of separate samples) can be shown to equal the true value of the desired parameter.\n\nIn [[decision theory]], and in particular in [[Expected utility hypothesis#Expected value and choice under risk|choice under uncertainty]], an agent is described as making an optimal choice in the context of incomplete information. For [[risk neutrality|risk neutral]] agents, the choice involves using the expected values of uncertain quantities, while for [[risk aversion|risk averse]] agents it involves maximizing the expected value of some [[objective function]] such as a [[von Neumann\u2013Morgenstern utility function]]. One example of using expected value in reaching optimal decisions is the [[Gordon-Loeb Model|Gordon\u2013Loeb model]] of information security investment. According to the model, one can conclude that the amount a firm spends to protect information should generally be only a small fraction of the expected loss (i.e., the expected value of the loss resulting from a cyber or information [[security breach]]).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Lawrence|last2=Loeb|first2=Martin|title=The Economics of Information Security Investment|journal=ACM Transactions on Information and System Security|date=November 2002|volume=5|issue=4|pages=438\u2013457|doi=10.1145/581271.581274}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Finite case===\nLet <math>X</math> be a random variable with a finite number of finite outcomes <math>x_1</math>, <math>x_2</math>, ..., <math>x_k</math> occurring with probabilities <math>p_1</math>, <math>p_2</math>, ..., <math>p_k</math>, respectively. The '''expectation''' of <math>X</math> is defined as\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[X] =\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i\\,p_i=x_1p_1 + x_2p_2 + \\cdots + x_kp_k</math>.\n\nSince all probabilities <math>p_i</math> add up to 1 (<math>p_1 + p_2 + \\ldots + p_k = 1</math>), the expected value is the [[weighted average]], with <math>p_i</math>\u2019s being the weights.\n\nIf all outcomes <math>x_i</math> are [[equiprobable]] (that is, <math>p_1 = p_2 = \\ldots = p_k</math>), then the weighted average turns into the simple [[arithmetic mean|average]]. This is intuitive: the expected value of a random variable is the average of all values it can take; thus the expected value is what one expects to happen ''on average''. If the outcomes <math>x_i</math> are not equiprobable, then the simple average must be replaced with the weighted average, which takes into account the fact that some outcomes are more likely than the others. The intuition however remains the same: the expected value of <math>X</math> is what one expects to happen ''on average''.\n\n[[File:Largenumbers.svg|An illustration of the convergence of sequence averages of rolls of a {{dice}} to the expected value of 3.5 as the number of rolls (trials) grows.|thumb|right|400 px]]\n\n====Examples====\n*Let <math>X</math> represent the outcome of a roll of a fair six-sided {{dice}}. More specifically, <math>X</math> will be the number of [[Pip (counting)|pips]] showing on the top face of the {{dice}} after the toss. The possible values for <math>X</math> are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, all equally likely (each having the probability of {{frac2|1|6}}). The expectation of <math>X</math> is\n:: <math>\\operatorname{E}[X] = 1\\cdot\\frac16 + 2\\cdot\\frac16 + 3\\cdot\\frac16 + 4\\cdot\\frac16 + 5\\cdot\\frac16 + 6\\cdot\\frac16 = 3.5.</math>\n\n:If one rolls the {{dice}} <math>n</math> times and computes the average ([[arithmetic mean]]) of the results, then as <math>n</math> grows, the average will [[almost surely]] [[Convergent sequence|converge]] to the expected value, a fact known as the [[strong law of large numbers]]. One example sequence of ten rolls of the {{dice}} is 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 6, 2, 2, 2, 6, which has the average of 3.1, with the distance of 0.4 from the expected value of 3.5. The convergence is relatively slow: the probability that the average falls within the range {{math|3.5 \u00b1 0.1}} is 21.6% for ten rolls, 46.1% for a hundred rolls and 93.7% for a thousand rolls. See the figure for an illustration of the averages of longer sequences of rolls of the {{dice}} and how they converge to the expected value of 3.5. More generally, the rate of convergence can be roughly quantified by e.g. [[Chebyshev's inequality]] and the [[Berry\u2013Esseen theorem]].\n\n*The [[roulette]] game consists of a small ball and a wheel with 38 numbered pockets around the edge. As the wheel is spun, the ball bounces around randomly until it settles down in one of the pockets. Suppose random variable <math>X</math> represents the (monetary) outcome of a $1 bet on a single number (\"straight up\" bet). If the bet wins (which happens with probability {{frac2|1|38}} in American roulette), the payoff is $35; otherwise the player loses the bet.

This relationship can be used to translate properties of expected values into properties of probabilities, e.g. using the law of large numbers to justify estimating probabilities by [[Statistical frequency|frequencies]].\n\nThe expected values of the powers of ''X'' are called the [[moment (mathematics)|moments]] of ''X''; the [[moment about the mean|moments about the mean]] of ''X'' are expected values of powers of ''X'' \u2212 E[''X'']. The moments of some random variables can be used to specify their distributions, via their [[moment generating function]]s.\n\nTo empirically [[Estimation theory|estimate]] the expected value of a random variable, one repeatedly measures observations of the variable and computes the [[arithmetic mean]] of the results. If the expected value exists, this procedure estimates the true expected value in an [[estimator bias|unbiased]] manner and has the property of minimizing the sum of the squares of the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (the sum of the squared differences between the observations and the [[estimator|estimate]]). The [[law of large numbers]] demonstrates (under fairly mild conditions) that, as the [[Sample size|size]] of the [[statistical sample|sample]] gets larger, the [[variance]] of this [[estimator|estimate]] gets smaller.\n\nThis property is often exploited in a wide variety of applications, including general problems of [[statistical estimation]] and [[machine learning]], to estimate (probabilistic) quantities of interest via [[Monte Carlo methods]], since most quantities of interest can be written in terms of expectation, e.g. <math>\\operatorname{P}({X \\in \\mathcal{A}}) = \\operatorname{E}[{\\mathbf 1}_{\\mathcal{A}}]</math>, where <math> {\\mathbf 1}_{\\mathcal{A}}</math> is the indicator function of the set <math>\\mathcal{A}</math>.\n\n[[File:Beta first moment.svg|thumb|The mass of probability distribution is balanced at the expected value, here a Beta(\u03b1,\u03b2) distribution with expected value \u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2).]] In [[classical mechanics]], the [[center of mass]] is an analogous concept to expectation. For example, suppose ''X'' is a discrete random variable with values ''x<sub>i</sub>'' and corresponding probabilities ''p<sub>i</sub>''. Now consider a weightless rod on which are placed weights, at locations ''x<sub>i</sub>'' along the rod and having masses ''p<sub>i</sub>'' (whose sum is one).

This problem had been debated for centuries, and many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years, when it was posed in 1654 to [[Blaise Pascal]] by French writer and amateur mathematician [[Antoine Gombaud|Chevalier de M\u00e9r\u00e9]]. M\u00e9r\u00e9 claimed that this problem couldn't be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and for all. He began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to [[Pierre de Fermat]]. Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively. However, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Ore, Pascal and the Invention of Probability Theory |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=67 |issue=5 |year=1960 |pages=409\u2013419 |doi=10.2307/2309286}}</ref>\n\nThree years later, in 1657, a Dutch mathematician [[Christiaan Huygens]], who had just visited Paris, published a treatise (see {{harvtxt|Huygens|1657}}) \"''De ratiociniis in ludo ale\u00e6''\" on probability theory. In this book he considered the problem of points and presented a solution based on the same principle as the solutions of Pascal and Fermat. Huygens also extended the concept of expectation by adding rules for how to calculate expectations in more complicated situations than the original problem (e.g., for three or more players). In this sense this book can be seen as the first successful attempt at laying down the foundations of the [[theory of probability]].\n\nIn the foreword to his book, Huygens wrote: \"It should be said, also, that for some time some of the best mathematicians of France have occupied themselves with this kind of calculus so that no one should attribute to me the honour of the first invention. This does not belong to me. But these savants, although they put each other to the test by proposing to each other many questions difficult to solve, have hidden their methods. I have had therefore to examine and go deeply for myself into this matter by beginning with the elements, and it is impossible for me for this reason to affirm that I have even started from the same principle. But finally I have found that my answers in many cases do not differ from theirs.\" (cited by {{harvtxt|Edwards|2002}}). Thus, Huygens learned about [[de M\u00e9r\u00e9's Problem]] in 1655 during his visit to France; later on in 1656 from his correspondence with Carcavi he learned that his method was essentially the same as Pascal's; so that before his book went to press in 1657 he knew about Pascal's priority in this subject.\n\nNeither Pascal nor Huygens used the term \"expectation\" in its modern sense. In particular, Huygens writes: \"That my Chance or Expectation to win any thing is worth just such a Sum, as wou'd procure me in the same Chance and Expectation at a fair Lay. ... If I expect a or b, and have an equal Chance of gaining them, my Expectation is worth {{frac2|a+b|2}}.\" More than a hundred years later, in 1814, [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] published his tract \"''Th\u00e9orie analytique des probabilit\u00e9s''\", where the concept of expected value was defined explicitly:\n\n{{quote|\u2026 this advantage in the theory of chance is the product of the sum hoped for by the probability of obtaining it; it is the partial sum which ought to result when we do not wish to run the risks of the event in supposing that the division is made proportional to the probabilities. This division is the only equitable one when all strange circumstances are eliminated; because an equal degree of probability gives an equal right for the sum hoped for. We will call this advantage ''mathematical hope''.}}\n\nThe use of the letter ''E'' to denote expected value goes back to [[William Allen Whitworth|W.A. Whitworth]] in 1901,<ref>Whitworth, W.A.

Low-pressure sodium lights are favoured for public lighting by astronomers, since the [[light pollution]] that they generate can be easily filtered, contrary to broadband or continuous spectra.\n\n===Incandescent light bulb===\n{{main article|Incandescent light bulb}}\n[[File:This room is equipped with Edison electric light.jpg|thumb|Sign with instructions on the use of light bulbs]]\n[[File:Hagley, St John the Baptist - interior, Mason memorial.jpg|thumb|[[St John the Baptist Church, Hagley]], tablet commemorating the installation of electric light]]\nThe modern incandescent light bulb, with a coiled filament of tungsten, and commercialized in the 1920s, developed from the carbon [[Electrical filament|filament]] lamp introduced about 1880. As well as bulbs for normal illumination, there is a very wide range, including low voltage, low-power types often used as components in equipment, but now largely displaced by LEDs\n\nThere is currently interest in banning some types of filament lamp in some countries, such as Australia, which has banned standard inefficient incandescent bulbs through a three-year phase out that started in 2009. Sri Lanka has already banned importing filament bulbs because of high use of electricity and less light. Less than 3% of the input energy is converted into usable light. Nearly all of the input energy ends up as heat that, in warm climates, must then be removed from the building by [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] or [[air conditioning]], often resulting in more energy consumption. In colder climates where heating and lighting is required during the cold and dark winter months, the heat byproduct has at least some value.\n\n====Halogen lamp====\n{{main article|Halogen lamp}}\n \nHalogen lamps are usually much smaller than standard incandescents, because for successful operation a bulb temperature  over 200&nbsp;\u00b0C is generally necessary.  For this reason, most have a bulb of fused silica (quartz), but sometimes aluminosilicate glass. This is often sealed inside an additional layer of glass. The outer glass is a safety precaution, reducing UV emission and because halogen bulbs can occasionally explode during operation. One reason is if the quartz bulb has oily residue from [[fingerprint]]s.  The risk of burns or fire is also greater with bare bulbs, leading to their prohibition in some places unless enclosed by the luminaire.\n\nThose designed for 12 or 24 volt operation have compact filaments, useful for good optical control, also they have higher efficiencies (lumens per watt) and better lives than non-halogen types. The light output remains almost constant throughout their life.\n\n===Fluorescent lamp===\n{{main article|Fluorescent lamp}}\n[[File:Leuchtstofflampen-chtaube050409.jpg|thumb|Top, two compact fluorescent lamps. Bottom, two fluorescent tube lamps. A matchstick, left, is shown for scale.]]\n[[Fluorescent lighting|Fluorescent]] lamps consist of a glass tube that contains mercury vapour or argon under low pressure. Electricity flowing through the tube causes the gases to give off ultraviolet energy. The inside of the tubes are coated with [[phosphor]]s that give off visible light when struck by ultraviolet energy.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perkowitz|first1=Sidney|last2=Henry|first2=A.

For the same amount of light generated, they typically use around one-quarter to one-third the power of an incandescent. The typical [[luminous efficacy]] of fluorescent lighting systems is 50\u2013100 lumens per watt, several times the efficacy of incandescent bulbs with comparable light output. Fluorescent lamp fixtures are more costly than incandescent lamps because they require a [[electrical ballast|ballast]] to regulate the [[Electric current|current]] through the lamp, but the lower energy cost typically offsets the higher initial cost. [[Compact fluorescent lamp]]s are now available in the same popular sizes as incandescents and are used as an [[energy-saving]] alternative in homes. Because they contain mercury, many fluorescent lamps are classified as [[hazardous waste]]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] recommends that fluorescent lamps be segregated from general waste for [[recycling]] or safe disposal, and some jurisdictions require recycling of them.<ref>[http://www.epa.gov/waste/hazard/wastetypes/universal/lamps/index.htm Mercury-Containing Light Bulb (Lamp) Recycling | Universal Waste | US EPA<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===LED lamp===\n{{main article|Solid-state lighting}}\n[[File:Led-lampa.jpg|thumb|[[LED lamp]] with E27 [[Edison screw]] base]]\nSolid state [[light-emitting diodes|LEDs]] have been popular as indicator lights in [[consumer electronics]] and professional audio gear since the 1970s. In the 2000s, [[Luminous efficacy|efficacy]] and output have risen to the point where LEDs are now being used in lighting applications such as car headlights and brakelights, in flashlights and bike lights, as well as in decorative applications such as holiday lighting.  Indicator LEDs are known for their extremely long life, up to 100,000 hours, but lighting LEDs are operated much less conservatively, and consequently have shorter lives. LED technology is useful for lighting designers because of its low power consumption, low heat generation, instantaneous on/off control, and in the case of single color LEDs, continuity of color throughout the life of the diode and relatively low cost of manufacture. LED lifetime depends strongly on the temperature of the diode. Operating an LED lamp in conditions that increase the internal temperature can greatly shorten the lamp's life.\n\n===Carbon arc lamp===\n{{main article|Arc lamp}}\n[[File:Xenon short arc 1.jpg|thumb|The 15 kW [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon short-arc lamp]] used in the [[IMAX]] projection system.]]\n[[File:Microscope MercuryArcBulb Detail.jpg|thumb|right|A [[mercury (element)|mercury]] arc lamp from a [[fluorescence microscope]].]]\n\nCarbon arc lamps consist of two carbon rod [[electrode]]s in open air, supplied by a current-limiting [[Electrical ballast|ballast]]. The [[electric arc]] is struck by touching the rods then separating them. The ensuing arc heats the carbon tips to white heat. These lamps have higher efficiency than filament lamps, but the carbon rods are short lived and require constant adjustment in use. The lamps produce significant [[ultraviolet]] output, they require ventilation when used indoors, and due to their intensity they need protecting from direct sight.\n\nInvented by [[Humphry Davy]] around 1805, the carbon arc was the first practical electric light.  They were used commercially beginning in the 1870s for large building and street lighting until they were superseded in the early 20th century by the incandescent light.  Carbon arc lamps operate at high powers and produce high intensity white light.   They also are a point source of light. They remained in use in limited applications that required these properties, such as [[movie projector]]s, [[stage lighting]], and [[searchlight]]s, until after World War 2.\n\n===Discharge lamp===\nA discharge lamp has a glass or silica envelope containing two metal [[electrode]]s separated by a gas. Gases used include, [[neon]], [[argon]], [[xenon]], [[sodium]], [[metal halide]], and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. The core operating principle is much the same as the carbon arc lamp, but the term 'arc lamp' is normally used to refer to carbon arc lamps, with more modern types of gas discharge lamp normally called discharge lamps. With some discharge lamps, very high voltage is used to strike the arc.  This requires an electrical circuit called an igniter, which is part of the [[Ballast (electrical)|ballast]] circuitry. After the arc is struck, the internal resistance of the lamp drops to a low level, and the ballast limits the current to the operating current. Without a ballast, excess current would flow, causing rapid destruction of the lamp.\n\nSome lamp types contain a little neon, which permits striking at normal running voltage, with no external ignition circuitry. [[Sodium vapor lamp|Low pressure sodium lamps]] operate this way. The simplest ballasts are just an inductor, and are chosen where cost is the deciding factor, such as street lighting. More advanced electronic ballasts may be designed to maintain constant light output over the life of the lamp, may drive the lamp with a square wave to maintain completely flicker-free output, and shut down in the event of certain faults.\n\n===Form factors===\n{{main|Incandescent light bulb#Bulb shapes|Lightbulb socket}}\nMany lamp units, or light bulbs, are specified in standarized shape codes and socket names. Incandescent bulbs and their retrofit replacements are often specified as \"[[A-series light bulb|A19]]/A60 [[edison screw|E26]]/E27\", a common size for these kind of light bulbs.\n\n==Lamp life expectancy==\nLife expectancy for many types of lamp is defined as the number of hours of operation at which 50% of them fail, that is the [[median]] life of the lamps. Production tolerances as low as 1% can create a variance of 25% in lamp life, so in general some lamps will fail well before the rated life expectancy, and some will last much longer. For LEDs, lamp life is defined as the operation time at which 50% of lamps have experienced a 70% decrease in light output.\n\nSome types of lamp are also sensitive to switching cycles. Rooms with frequent switching such as bathrooms can expect much shorter lamp life than what is printed on the box. Compact fluorescent lamps are particularly sensitive to switching cycles.\n\n==Public lighting==\nThe total amount of artificial light (especially from [[street light]]) is sufficient for cities to be easily visible at night from the air, and from space.  This light is the source of [[light pollution]] that burdens [[astronomy|astronomers]] and others.\n<center>[[File:Earthlights dmsp 1994\u20131995.jpg|frameless|upright=2.95]]\n<br /><small>Human-made lights highlight particularly developed or populated areas of the Earth's surface, including the seaboards of Europe, the eastern United States, India, Japan and South Korea.</small> <br></center>\n\n==Uses other than illumination==\n[[File:Gluehlampe 01 KMJ.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|A clear glass 60 W Neolux light bulb]]\nElectric lamps can be used as heat sources, for example in [[Incubator (egg)|incubator]]s, as [[heat lamp]]s in [[fast food]] restaurants and toys such as the [[Easy-Bake Oven]].\n\nTungsten filament lamps have long been used as fast-acting [[thermistor]]s in electronic circuits. Popular uses have included:\n* Stabilisation of sine wave oscillators\n* Protection of [[loudspeaker|tweeters]] in [[speaker enclosure]]s (excess current that is too high for the tweeter illuminates the light rather than blowing the tweeter).\n* [[Automatic volume control]] in telephones\n\n==Lamp circuit symbols==\nIn [[circuit diagram]]s lamps usually are shown as symbols.

Experts in the field advised against this course of action, stating that the different media would just end up competing against each other. Burroughs went ahead, however, and proved the experts wrong \u2013 the public wanted Tarzan in whatever fashion he was offered. Tarzan remains one of the most successful fictional characters to this day and is a [[cultural icon]].\n\nIn either 1915 or 1919, Burroughs purchased a large ranch north of [[Los Angeles]], California, which he named \"Tarzana\".

But as it turns out \u2013 and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly \u2013 Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world.\"<ref>[http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6012/the-art-of-fiction-no-203-ray-bradbury Paris Review]</ref> Bradbury continued that \"By giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special.\"\n\nIn ''Something of Myself'' (published posthumously in 1937) [[Rudyard Kipling]] wrote: \u201cMy ''Jungle Books'' begat Zoos of them. But the genius of all the genii was one who wrote a series called ''Tarzan of the Apes''. I read it, but regret I never saw it on the films, where it rages most successfully. He had \u2018jazzed\u2019 the motif of the ''Jungle Books'' and, I imagine, had thoroughly enjoyed himself. He was reported to have said that he wanted to find out how bad a book he could write and \u2018get away with\u2019, which is a legitimate ambition.\u201d (Ch. 8, \u201cWorking Tools\u201d).\n\nBy 1963, [[Floyd C. Gale]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' wrote when discussing reprints of several Burroughs novels by [[Ace Books]], \"an entire generation has grown up inexplicably Burroughs-less\".

His major restoration projects included [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], the [[Basilica of Saint Denis]], [[Mont Saint-Michel]], [[Sainte-Chapelle]], and the medieval walls of the city of [[Carcassonne]]. His later writings on the relationship between form and function in architecture had a notable influence on a new generation of architects, including [[Antonio Gaud\u00ed]], [[Victor Horta]], and [[Louis Sullivan]].\n\n==Youth and education==\nViollet-le-Duc was born in Paris in 1814, in the last year of the Empire of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. His grandfather was an architect, and his father was a high-ranking civil servant, who in 1816 became the overseer of the royal residences of Louis XVIII. His uncle [[\u00c9tienne-Jean Del\u00e9cluze]] was a painter, a former student of [[Jacques-Louis David]], an art critic and hosted a literary salon, which was attended by [[Stendhal]] and [[Sainte-Beuve]]. His mother hosted her own salon, which women could attend as well as men.  There, in 1822 or 1823, Eug\u00e8ne met [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]], a writer who would play a decisive role in his career.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=12}}<ref name=summerson/>\n\nIn 1825 he began his education at the Pension Moran, in Fontenay-aux-Roses. He returned to Paris in 1829 as a student at the College de Bourbon (now the [[Lyc\u00e9e Condorcet]]).  He passed his baccalaureate examination in 1830. His uncle urged him to enter the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], which had been created in 1806, but the ''\u00c9cole '' had an extremely rigid system, based entirely on copying classical models, and Eug\u00e8ne was not interested. Instead he decided to get practical experience in the architectural offices of [[Jacques-Marie Huv\u00e9]] and [[Achille Lecl\u00e8re]], while devoting much of his time to drawing medieval churches and monuments around Paris.\n\nHe participated in the July 1830 revolution which overthrew Louis XVIII, building a barricade, his first known construction project.  Following the revolution, which brought [[Louis Philippe]] to power, his father became chief of the bureau of royal residences. The new government created, for the first time, the position of Inspector General of Historic Monuments.  Eug\u00e8ne's uncle Delescluze agreed to take Eug\u00e8ne on a long tour of France to see monuments. They traveled from July to October 1831 throughout the south of France, and he returned with a large collection of detailed paintings and watercolors of churches and monuments.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=12}}\n[[File:Banquet des dames aux Tuileries 1835.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Women's Banquet at the Tuileries'' painted by Viollet-le-Duc (1835)]]\nOn his return to Paris, he moved with his family into the Tuileries Palace, where his father was now governor of royal residences. His family again urged him to attend the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, but he still refused.  He wrote in his journal in December 1831, \"the ''\u00c9cole'' is just a mold for architects. they all come out practically identical.\"{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=12}} He was a talented and meticulous artist; he traveled around France to visit monuments, cathedrals, and other medieval architecture, made detailed drawings and watercolors, which he sometimes sold at a high price to members of the Court.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=56}}\n\nOn May 3, 1834, at age twenty, he married \u00c9lisabeth Templier, and in the same year he was named an associate professor of ornamental decoration at the Royal School of Decorative Arts, which gave him a more regular income.  With the money from the sale of his drawings and paintings, the couple set off on a long tour of the monuments of Italy, visiting Rome, Venice, Florence and other sites, drawing and painting. His reaction to the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] was characteristic: \"It was extremely disagreeable to see\", he wrote, \"it would have been infinitely better if it had been straight.\"{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=61}}  In 1838, he presented several of his drawings at the [[Paris Salon]], and began making a travel book, ''Picturesque and romantic images of the old France'', for which, between 1838 and 1844, he made nearly three hundred engravings.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=68}}\n\n==First architectural restorations==\n[[File:Vezelay-7776-Bearbeitet.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[V\u00e9zelay Abbey]], Viollet-le-Duc's first restoration project]]\n\nIn October 1838, with the recommendation of [[Achille Lecl\u00e8re]], the architect with whom he had trained, he was named deputy inspector of the enlargement of the [[H\u00f4tel Soubise]], the new home of the French National Archives.  His uncle, Delescluze, then recommended him to the new Commission of Historic Monuments of France, led by [[Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e]], who had just published a book on medieval French monuments. Though he was just twenty-four years old and had no degree in architecture, he was asked to go to [[Narbonne]] to propose a plan for the completion of the cathedral there. He made his first plan, which included not only the completion but also the restoration of the oldest parts of the structure.  His first project was rejected by the local authorities as too ambitious and too expensive.\n\nHis next project was a restoration of the [[V\u00e9zelay Abbey]], the church of a [[Benedictine]] monastery founded in the 12th century to house the reputed relics of [[Mary Magdalene]].  The church had been sacked by the [[Huguenots]] in 1569, and during the French Revolution, the facade and statuary on the facade were destroyed. The vaults of the roof were weakened, and many of the stones had been carried off for other projects.  When M\u00e9rim\u00e9e visited to inspect the structure he heard stones falling around him.  In February 1840 M\u00e9rim\u00e9e gave Viollet-le-Duc the mission of restoring and reconstructing the church so it would not collapse, while \"respecting exactly in his project of restoration all the ancient dispositions of the church\".{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=76}}\n\nThe task was all the more difficult because up until that time no scientific studies had been made of medieval building techniques, and there were no schools of restoration.  He had no plans for the original building to work from.  Viollet-le-Duc had to discover the flaws of construction that had caused the building to start to collapse in the first place and to construct a more solid and stable structure. He lightened the roof and built new arches to stabilize the structure, and slightly changed the shape of the vaults and arches.  He was criticized for these modifications in the 1960s, though, as his defenders argued, without them the roof would have collapsed under its own weight.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=76}}\n\nM\u00e9rim\u00e9e's deputy, Lenormant, inspected the construction and reported to M\u00e9rim\u00e9e: \"The young Leduc seems entirely worthy of your confidence. He needed a magnificent audacity to take charge of such a desperate enterprise; it's certain that he arrived just in time, and if we had waited only ten years the church would have been a pile of stones.\"{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=82}}\n\n==Sainte-Chapelle and Amboise==\nViollet-le-Duc's work at Vezelay led to a series of larger projects. In 1840, in collaboration with his friend the architect [[Jean-Baptiste Lassus]] he began the restoration of [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, which had been turned into a storage depot after the Revolution.  His role in this project was relatively minor, with Lassus taking the lead.  In February 1843, King Louis Philippe sent him to the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]], to restore the stained glass windows in the chapel holding the tomb of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The windows were unfortunately destroyed in 1940 during World War&nbsp;II.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=96}}\n\nIn 1843, M\u00e9rim\u00e9e took Viollet-le-Duc with him to Burgundy and the south of France, on one of his long inspection tours of possible monuments. The two men shared the same passion for the gothic. Viollet-le-Duc made drawings of the buildings and wrote detailed accounts of each site, illustrated with his drawing, which were published in architectural journals.  These articles were later turned into books; he became the most prominent academic scholar on French medieval architecture.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=96}}\n\n==Notre-Dame de Paris==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" height=\"250px\">\nFile:ND de Paris avant 1841.jpg|Facade about 1841, pre-restoration\nFile:Lassus, Viollet-le-Duc - Projet de restauration de Notre-Dame de Paris - page 4.jpg|Proposed doorway decoration\nFile:Notre Dame de Paris, East View 140207 1.jpg| View of the spire of Notre-Dame restored by Viollet-le-Duc\nFile:Treasury of Notre Dame Cathedral.jpg|The treasury of the cathedral, designed by Viollet-le-Duc to replace destroyed Archbishop's residence (1849)\nFile:Notre Dame Cathedral- Window of Chapelle Saint-Clotilde by Eugene Viollet-le-Duc.jpg|Window of the Chapel of Saint-Clotilde designed by Viollet-le-Duc (1864)\nFile:Vue.interieure.travee.cathedrale.Paris.png|Drawing of the interior traverse\nFile:Viollet-le-Duc, les visions d'un architecte (4).jpg|Choir gate designed by Viollet-le-Duc\nFile:Reliquaire du Clou et du Bois de la Croix.jpg|Reliquary designed by Viollet-le-Duc\nFile:Fleche.Notre.Dame.Paris.png|Plan of the spire\nFile:Notre-Dame de Paris 086.jpg|Saint Thomas on the spire, resembling Viollet-le-Duc\n\n</gallery>\nIn 1844, with the backing of M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, Viollet-le-Duc, just thirty years old, and Lassus, then thirty-seven, won a competition for the restoration of [[Notre-Dame Cathedral]].  Their project involved primarily the facade, where many of the statues over the portals had been beheaded or smashed during the Revolution.  They proposed two major changes to the interior: rebuilding two of the bays to their original medieval height of four stories, and removing the marble neoclassical structures and decoration which had been added to the choir during the reign of Louis XIV.  M\u00e9rim\u00e9e warned them to be careful: \"In such a project, one cannot act with too much prudence or discretion...A restoration may be more disastrous for a monument than the ravages of centuries.\"{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=96}}  The Commission on Historical Monuments approved most of Viollet-le-Duc's plans, but rejected his proposal to remove the choir built under Louis XIV.  Viollet-le-Duc himself turned down a proposal to add two new spires atop the towers, arguing that such a monument \"would be remarkable but would not be Notre Dame de Paris\".{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pages=96\u201399}} Instead, he proposed to rebuild the original medieval spire and bell tower over the transept, which had been removed in 1786 because it was unstable in the wind.<ref name=\"autogenerated260\"/>\n\nOnce the project was approved, Viollet-le-Duc made drawings and photographs of the existing decorative elements; then they were removed and a stream of sculptors began making new statues of saints, gargoyles, chimeras and other architectural elements in a workshop he established, working from his drawings and photographs of similar works in other cathedrals of the same period.<ref name=\"autogenerated260\">A. Trintignac and M.J. Coloni, ''Decouvrir Notre-Dame de Paris'' Les Editions du Cerf, 1984, {{ISBN|2-204-02087-7}}, p. 260.</ref>  Other craftsmen made stained glass windows in Gothic [[grisaille]] patterns designed by Viollet-le-Duc to replace the destroyed medieval windows in the chapels of the ground floor of the nave of the cathedral.  He also designed a new treasury in the Gothic style to serve as the museum of the cathedral, replacing the residence of the Archbishop, which had been destroyed in a riot in 1831.\n\nThe bells in the two towers had been taken out in 1791 and melted down to make cannon.  Viollet-le-Duc had new bells cast for the north tower and a new structure built inside to support them.  Viollet-le-Duc and Lassus also rebuilt the sacristy, on the south side of the church, which had been built in 1756, but had been burned by rioters during the [[July Revolution]] of 1848. The new spire was completed, taller and more strongly built to withstand the weather; it was decorated with statues of the apostles, and the face of Saint Thomas bore a noticeable resemblance to Viollet-le-Duc.<ref name=\"autogenerated260\"/>\n\n==Saint Denis and Amiens==\n\nThe restoration of Notre-Dame continued in this slow and methodical manner for twenty-five years. When not engaged in Paris, Viollet-le-Duc continued his long tours into the French provinces, inspecting, drawing, and making recommendations, and checking the progress of more than twenty different restoration projects that were under his control, including seven in Burgundy alone. His new projects included the [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse]], and the [[Basilica of Saint-Denis]] just outside Paris.  Saint-Denis had undergone a restoration by a different architect, Francois Debret, who had rebuilt one of the two towers.  However, in 1846, the new tower, overloaded with masonry, began to crack, and Viollet-le-Duc was called in. He found no way the building could be saved; he had to oversee the demolition of the tower, saving the stones.  He concentrated on restoring the interior of the church, and was able to substantially restore the original burial chamber of the Kings of France.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=114}}\n\nIn May 1849, he was named the architect for the restoration of [[Amiens Cathedral]], one of the largest in France, which had been built over many centuries in a variety of different styles. He wrote, \"his goal should be to save in each part of the monument its own character, and yet to make it so that the united parts don't conflict with each other; and that can be maintained in a state that is durable and simple.\"{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=138}}\n\nFor his restorations of churches and cathedrals, Viollet-le-Duc designed not only architecture, but new altars and furnishings.  His new furnishings were installed in the sacristy of Notre-Dame, and his neo-Gothic altar was placed in the restored [[Cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand]]. Thanks largely to Viollet-le-Duc, the neo-Gothic became the standard style for church furnishing throughout France.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=114}}\n\n==Imperial projects: Carcassonne, Vincennes and Pierrefonds==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" height=\"200px\">\nFile:Carcasonneouterwall.jpg|The walled town of [[Carcassonne]] (restored 1853\u20131879)\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|The keep of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]] (restored in the 1860s) \nFile:Description du chateau de pierrefonds Figure 00.png|Drawing by VLD of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]] before restoration\nFile:\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0438, \u0441. 6\u20137.jpg|Plans of Pierrefonds by Viollet-le-Duc\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds vu depuis le Parc.jpg|The [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]] today\nFile:0 Chapiteau polychrome du ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds (1).JPG|Polychrome decoration at Pierrefonds by Viollet-le-Duc\n</gallery>\n\nThe Coup d'\u00c9tat of 1852 had transformed France from a republic to an empire and brought Napoleon&nbsp;III to power.  The coup accelerated some of Viollet-le-Duc's projects.  His patron and supervisor, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, had introduced the Emperor to the new Empress, and brought Viollet-le-Duc into close contact with the Emperor.  The Emperor married the Empress Eug\u00e9nie in Notre-Dame, and the government voted additional funds to advance the restoration.  He moved forward with the slow work of restoration of the [[Cathedral of Reims]] and [[Cathedral of Amiens]].  In Amiens, he cleared the interior of the French classical decoration added under Louis XIV, and proposed to make it resolutely Gothic. He gave the Emperor and Empress a tour of his project in September 1853; the Empress immediately offered to pay two-thirds of the cost of the restoration.  In the same year he undertook the restoration of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], long occupied by the military, along with its chapel, similar to [[Sainte-Chapelle]].  A devotee of the pure Gothic, he described the chapel as \"one of the finest specimens of Gothic in decline\".{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=58}}\n\nIn November 1853, he provided the costs and plans for the medieval ramparts of [[Carcassonne]], which he had first begun planning in 1849.  The first fortifications had been built by the [[Visigoths]]; on top of these, in the Middle Ages [[Louis XI of France|Louis&nbsp;XI]] and then [[Philip the Bold]] had built a formidable series of towers, galleries, walls, gates and interlocking defenses that resisted all sieges until 1355. The fortifications were largely intact, since the surroundings of the city were still a military defensive zone in the 19th century, but the towers were without tops and a large number of structures had been built up against the old walls. Once he obtained funding and made his plans, he began demolishing all structures which had been attached to ramparts over the centuries, and restored the gates, walls and towers to their original form, including the defense platforms, roofs on the towers and shelters for archers that would have been used during a siege. He found many of the original mountings for weapons still in place.  To accompany his work, he published a detailed history of the city and its fortifications, with his drawings.<ref>Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc, ''La Cit\u00e9 de Carcassonne'', Librarie des Imprimeries R\u00e9unies, Paris 1888</ref> Carcassonne became the best example of medieval military architecture in France, and also an important tourist attraction.{{sfn|Poisson|2014|page=158}}\n\nNapoleon&nbsp;III provided additional funding for the continued restoration of Notre-Dame. Viollet-le-Duc was also to replace the great bestiary of mythical beasts and animals which had decorated the cathedral in the 18th century. In 1856, using examples from other medieval churches and debris from Notre-Dame as his model, his workshop produced dragons, chimeras, grotesques, and gargoyles, as well as an assortment of picturesque pinnacles and [[fleuron (architecture)|fleurons]].{{sfn|Poisson|2014|pages=158\u20139}}  He engaged in a new project for restoration of the [[Cathedral of Clermont-Ferrand]], a project which continued for ten years.  He also undertook an unusual project for Napoleon&nbsp;III; the design and construction of six railway coaches with neo-Gothic interiors decor for the Emperor and his entourage.  Two of the cars still exist; the salon of honor car, with a fresco on he ceiling, is at the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne]], and the dining car, with a massive golden eagle as the centerpiece of the decor, is at the Railroad Museum of [[Mulhouse]].\n\nNapoleon&nbsp;III asked Viollet-le-Duc if he could restore a medieval chateau for the Emperor's own use near Compi\u00e8gne, where the Emperor traditionally passed September and October.  Viollet-le-Duc first studied a restoration of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Coucy]], which had the highest medieval tower in France.  When this proved too complicated, he settled upon [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], a castle begun by Louis of Orleans in 1396, then dismantled in 1617 after several sieges by [[Louis XIII of France]].  Napoleon bought the ruin for 5000 francs in 1812, and M\u00e9rim\u00e9e declared it an historic monument in 1848.  In 1857 Viollet-le-Duc began designing an entirely new chateau on the ruins.  This structure was not designed to recreate anything exactly that had existed, but a castle which recaptured the spirit of the gothic, with lavish neo-gothic decoration and 19th century comforts.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=190}}\n\nWhile most of his attention was devoted to restorations, Viollet-le-Duc designed and built a number of private residences and new buildings in Paris.  He also participated in the most important competition of the period, for the new Paris Opera.  There were one hundred seventy-one projects proposed in the original competition, presented the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|1855 Paris Universal Exposition]].  A jury of noted architects narrowed it down to five, including projects from [[Hector Guimard]], Viollet-le-Duc, [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]] and [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], age thirty-five. The favorites of the Emperor and Empress were de Fleury and Viollet-le-Duc, but both were eliminated in the next round. Viollet-le-Duc was not a good loser, and he dismissed Garnier's style. Garnier wrote of his rival in 1869: \"Monsieur Viollet-le-Duc has produced much, but his best works without doubt are his restorations...One hesitates to appreciate his personal works. You cannot find any personality in them, only compromise. He is broken by archeology and crushed by the weight of the past. If it is difficult to learn, it is even more difficult to forget.\"<ref>Garnier, Charles, ''\u00c0 travers les arts'', (1869)</ref>\n\nNapoleon&nbsp;III called upon Viollet-le-Duc for a wide variety of archeological and architectural tasks. When he wished to put up a monument to mark the [[Battle of Alesia]], where Julius Caesar defeated the Gauls, a battle whose actual site was disputed by historians, he asked Viollet-le-Duc to locate the exact battlefield.  Viollet-le-duc conducted excavations at various purported sites, and finally found vestiges of the walls that Caesar had built. He also designed the metal frame for the six-meter-high statue that would be placed on the site.  He later designed a similar frame for a much larger statue, the [[Statue of Liberty]], but died before that statue was finished.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=190}}\n\n==End of the Empire and of Restoration==\nIn 1863, Viollet-le-Duc was named a professor at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, the school where he had refused to become a student, and the fortress of neoclassical [[Beaux-Arts architecture]]. This launched him on a new academic career as an architectural theorist, where he would have as much influence as he did as an architect of restorations. There was much resistance from the traditional faculty, but he attracted two hundred students to his course, who applauded his lecture at the end.  He had already published the first volumes of his first major work, ''A Reasoned Dictionary of French Architecture''. This series eventually included ten volumes, published between 1854 and 1868. But while he had many supporters, the faculty and many of the students were strongly against him, His critics complained that, aside from having little formal architectural training himself, he had only built a handful of new buildings. He tired of the confrontations and resigned on 16 May 1863, and continued his writing and teaching outside the Beaux-Arts.\n\nIn the beginning of 1864, he celebrated the conclusion of his most important project, the restoration of Notre-Dame.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pages=243\u2013250}}  In January of the same year he completed the first phase of the restoration of the [[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse|Cathedral of Saint Sernin]] in Toulouse, one of the landmarks of French Romanesque architecture.  Napoleon&nbsp;III invited Viollet-le-Duc to study possible restorations overseas, including in Algeria, Corsica, and in Mexico, where Napoleon had installed a new Emperor, Maximilien, under French sponsorship.   He also saw the consecration of the third church that he had designed, the neo-Gothic Church of Saint-Denis de l'Estree, in the Paris suburb of [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]].  Between 1866 and 1870, his major project was the ongoing transformation of Pierrefonds from a ruin into a royal residence. His plans for the metal framework he had designed for Pierrefonds were displayed at the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1867]].   He also completed the tenth and final volume of his monumental dictionary of medieval architecture.  He also began a new area of study, researching the geology and geography of the region around [[Mont Blanc]] in the Alps.  While on his mapping excursion in the Alps in July 1870, he learned that war had been declared between Prussia and France.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=262}}\n\nAs the [[Franco-Prussian War]] commenced, Viollet-le-Duc hurried back to Paris, and offered his services as a military engineer; he was put into service as a colonel of engineers, preparing the defenses of Paris.   In September, the Emperor was captured at the [[Battle of Sedan]], a new Republican government took power, and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie fled into exile, as Germans marched as far as Paris and put it under siege.  At the same time, on September 23, Viollet-le-Duc's primary patron and supporter, Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, died peacefully in the south of France.  Viollet-le-Duc supervised the construction of new defensive works outside Paris. On 14 December 1870, he wrote in his journal, \"Disorganization is everywhere. The officers have no confidence in the troops, and the troops have no confidence in the officers. Each day, new orders and new projects which contravene those of the day before.\"   He fought with the French army against the Germans at Buzenval on 24 January 1871.  The battle was lost, and the French capitulated on 28 January.  Viollet-le-Duc wrote to his wife on February 28, \"I don't know what will become of me, but I do not want to return any more to administration. I am disgusted by it forever, and want nothing more than to pass the years that remain to me in study and in the most modest possible life.\"{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\nIn May 1871 he left his home in Paris just before national guardsmen arrived to draft him into the armed force of the [[Paris Commune]]. He returned to Pierrefonds, where he had a small apartment.  Always the scholar, he wrote a detailed study of the effectiveness and deficiencies of the fortifications of Paris during the siege.   He returned to the city shortly after the Commune was suppressed in May, 1871, and saw the ruins of most of the public buildings of the city, burned by the Commune in its last days.   He received his only commission from the new government of the [[French Third Republic]]; [[Jules Simon]], the new Minister of Culture and Public Instruction, asked him to design a plaque to be placed before Notre-Dame to honor the hostages killed by the Paris Commune in its final days.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\nThe new government of the French Third Republic made little use of his expertise in the restoration of the major government buildings which had been burned by the [[Paris Commune]], including the [[Tuileries Palace]], the [[Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur|Palace of the Legion of Honor]], the [[Palais Royale]], the library of the [[Louvre]], the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance. The only reconstruction on which he was consulted was that of the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]]. The writer [[Edmond de Goncourt]] called for leaving the ruin of the Hotel de Ville exactly as it was, \"a ruin of a magical palace, A marvel of the picturesque. The country should not condemn it without appeal to restoration by Viollet-le-Duc.\" The government asked Viollet-le-Duc to organize a competition. He presented two options; to either restore the building to its original state, with its historic interior; or to demolish it and build a new city hall.  In July 1872 the government decided to preserve the Renaissance facade, but otherwise to completely demolish and rebuild the building.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pp=287\u2013288}}\n\n==Later life \u2013 author and theorist==\nIn his later years he devoted most of his time to writing about architectural history. He consulted on many of his earlier projects around France, which were still underway.  He also continued his explorations of the Alps around Mount Blanc, making a detailed map and a series of thirty-two drawings of the alpine scenery.  He passed by [[Lausanne]], where he was asked to prepare a plan for the restoration of the cathedral, which he did. In 1872, he completed the second volume of his major theoretical work, ''Entretiens sur l'architecture''.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=302}}\n\nIn his ''Entretiens sur l'architecture'' he concentrated in particular on the use of iron and other new materials, and the importance of designing buildings whose architecture was adapted to their function, rather than to a particular style.   The book was translated into English in 1881 and won a large following in the United States.  The Chicago architect [[Louis Sullivan]], one of the inventors of the skyscraper, often invoked the phrase, \"Form follows function.\"\n\nThe Lausanne cathedral was his final major restoration project; it was rebuilt following his plans between 1873 and 1876.  Work continued after his death. His reconstruction of the bell tower was later criticized; he eliminated the original octagonal base and added a new spire, which rested on the walls, and not on the vaulting, like the original spire. He also added new decoration, crowning the spire at mid-height with gables, another original element, and removing the original tiles. He was also criticized for the materials and ornaments he added to the towers, including gargoyles.  His structural design was preserved, but in 1925 his gargoyles and original ornamentation were removed, and the spire was recovered with tiles.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pages=307\u2013308}}\n\nHis reputation had reached outside of France. The spire and roof of [[Strasbourg Cathedral]] had been damaged by German artillery during the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and the city was now part of Germany. The German government invited Viollet-le-Duc to comment on their plans for the restoration, which involved a more grandiose Romanesque tower.  Viollet-le-Duc informed the German architect that his planned new tower was completely out of character with the original facade and style of the cathedral. His advice was accepted, and the church was restored to its original form.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pages=307\u2013308}}\n\nIn 1872 Viollet-le-Duc was engaged in the reconstruction of the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], owned by the descendants of the former King, Louis-Philippe.  The chateau had been confiscated by Napoleon&nbsp;III in 1848 but was returned to the family in 1872. It was a massive project to turn it into a residence, involving at times three hundred workers. Viollet-le-Duc designed all the work to the finest details, including the floor tiles, the gas lights in the salons, the ovens in the kitchen, and the electric bells for summoning servants.\n\nIn 1874 Viollet-le-Duc resigned as diocesan architect of Paris and was succeeded by his contemporary, [[Paul Abadie]].<ref>{{cite web|author=jpd |url=http://histoire-vesinet.org/abadie-bio.htm |title=Paul Abadie, architecte |publisher=Histoire-vesinet.org |date= |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref> In his final years, he continued to supervise the restoration projects that were underway for the Commission of Historical Monuments.   He engaged in polemics about architecture in the press, and was elected to the Paris municipal council.\n\n==National Museum of French Monuments and final years==\n[[File:Galerie des moulages.jpg|humb|right|150px|The [[Mus\u00e9e national des Monuments Fran\u00e7ais|National Museum of French Monuments]]]]\n\nHe became engaged in the planning and construction of the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|Paris Universal Exposition of 1878]]. He proposed to the Minister of Education, [[Jules Ferry]], that the Palais de Trocadero, the main building of the Exposition on the hilltop of Chaillot, be transformed after the Exposition into a museum of French monuments, displaying models of architecture and sculpture from landmarks around France. This idea was accepted. The [[Mus\u00e9e national des Monuments Fran\u00e7ais|National Museum of French Monuments]] opened in 1882, after his death. The Palais was reconstructed into the [[Palais de Chaillot]] in 1937, but the Museum of French Monuments was preserved and can be seen there today.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=328}}\n\nIn his final years his son Eug\u00e8ne-Louis became the head of the Commission of Historic Monuments. He took on just one new project, the restoration of the cloister of the Augustines at Toulouse. He completed his series of dictionaries of architectural periods, designed for a general audience.  He also devoted more time to studying the geography of the Alps around Mont-Blanc.  He spent his summers hiking in the mountains and writing articles about his travels. He launched a public campaign for the re-forestation of the Alps, and published a detailed map of the area in 1876. He spent more and more time at ''La Vedette'', the villa he constructed in Lausanne, a house on the model of a Savoyard chalet, but with a minimum of decoration, illustrating his new doctrine of form following function. He made one last visit to inspect Carcassonne, whose work was now under his son's direction. After an exhausting summer of hiking in the Alps in 1879, he became ill and died in Lausanne on 17 September 1879. He was buried in the cemetery of La Sallaz in Lausanne. In 1946 his grave and monument were transferred in 1946 to the Cemetery of Bois-le-Vaux (Section XVIII) in Lausanne.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=336}}\n\n==Family==\nViollet-le-Duc married Elisabeth Tempier in Paris on 3 May 1834. The couple had two children, but separated a few years after marriage, and spent little time together; he was continually on the road. The writer [[Genevi\u00e8ve Viollet-le-Duc]] (winner of the [[prix Broquette-Gonin]] in 1978) was his great-granddaughter.\n\n==Doctrine==\nViollet-le-Duc famously defined restoration in volume eight of his  ''Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XI au XVI siecle'' of 1858: \"To restore a building is not to maintain it, repair it or remake it: it is to re-establish it in a complete state which may never have existed at any given moment.\" He then explained that it had to meet four conditions: (1) The \"re-establishment\" had to be scientifically documented with plans and photographs and archeological records, which would guarantee exactness. (2) The restoration had to involve not just the appearance of the monument, or the effect that it produced, but also its structure; it had to use the most efficient means to assure the long life of the building, including using more solid materials, used more wisely. (3) the restoration had to exclude any modification contrary to obvious evidence; but the structure could be adapted to conform to more modern or rational uses and practices, which meant alterations to the original plan; and (4) The restoration should preserve older modifications made to the building, with the exception of those which compromised its stability or its conservation, or those which gravely violated the value of its historical presence.{{Sfn|''Encyclopaedia Universalis \u2013 Dictionnaire des Architects''|1999|pages=710\u2013711}}\n\nHe drew conclusions from medieval architecture that he applied to modern architecture. He noted that it was sometimes necessary to employ an iron frame in restoration to avoid the danger of fires, as long as the new structure was not heavier than the original, and kept the original balance of forces found in medieval structures. \"The monuments of the Middle Ages were carefully calculated, and their organism is delicate. There is nothing in excess in their works, nothing useless. If you change one of the conditions of these organisms, you change all the others. Many people consider this a fault; for us, this is a quality which we too often neglect in our modern construction....Why should we build expensive walls two meters thick, if walls fifty centimeters thick [with reinforced supports], offer sufficient stability? In the structure of the Middle Ages, every portion of a work fulfilled a function and possessed an action.\"<ref>Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e8ne, ''Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XI au XVI siecle'' (1858)</ref>\n\n==Gothic vs. Beaux-Arts==\nDuring the entire career of Viollet-le-Duc, he was engaged in a dispute with the doctrines of the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts]], the leading architectural school of France, which he refused to attend as a student, and where he taught briefly as a professor, before being pressured to depart. In 1846 he engaged in a fervent exchange in print with Quatrem\u00e8re de Quincy, the Perpetual Secretary of the French Academy, on the question, \"Is it suitable, in the 19th century, to build churches in the gothic style?\" De Quincy and his followers denounced the gothic style as incoherent, disorderly, unintelligent, decadent and without taste.  Viollet-le-Duc responded, \"What we want, ''messieurs'', is the return of an art which was born in our country....Leave to Rome what belongs to Rome, and to Athens what belongs to Athens. Rome didn't want our Gothic (and was perhaps the only one in Europe to reject it) and they were right, because when one has the good fortune to possess a national architecture, the best thing is to keep it.\"\n\n\"If you study for a moment a church of the 13th century\", he wrote, \"you see that all of the construction is carried out according to an invariable system.  All the forces and the weights are thrust out to the exterior, a disposition which gives the interior the greatest open space possible. The flying buttresses and contreforts alone support the entire structure, and always have an aspect of resistance, of force and stability which reassures the eye and the spirit; The vaults, built with materials that are easy to mount and to place at a great height, are combined in a easy that places the totality of their weight on the piles; that the most simple means are always employed...and that all the parts of these constructions, independent of each other, even as they rely on each other, present an elasticity and a lightness needed in a building of such great dimensions.  We can still see (and this is only found in gothic architecture) that human proportions are the one fixed rule.\"<ref>{{Gutenberg book |last=Viollet-le-Duc |first=Eug\u00e8ne |title=Du style Gothique au Dix-neuvi\u00e8me Si\u00e9cle |date=June 1846 |no=18919 |bullet=none}}</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nViollet-le-Duc was accused by his critics, in his own time and later, of pursuing the spirit of the gothic style in some of his restorations instead of strict historical accuracy.  The British historian and architectural writer John Ruskin wrote in \"The Seven Lamps of Architecture\" in 1849: \"Neither the public, nor those who are responsible for the maintenance of public monuments, understand the true meaning of 'restoration'. It signifies the most complete destruction that an edifice can suffer; a destruction from which not a single vestige can be recovered; a destruction that comes from the false description of the thing destroyed.  It is impossible, as impossible as it is to bring the dead back to life, to restore whatever might have been grand or beautiful in architecture....the enterprise is a lie from the beginning to the end.\" Despite this skepticism, Ruskin expressed his admiration for the historical research and writings of Viollet-le-Duc.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|page=137}}\n\nViollet-le-Duc's restorations sometimes involved non-historical additions, either to assure the stability of the building, or sometimes simply to maintain the harmony of the design. The [[fl\u00e8che]], or spire of Notre-Dame de Paris, which had been constructed in about 1250, was removed in 1786 after it was damaged by the wind.  Viollet-le-Duc designed and constructed a new spire, ornamented with statuary, which was taller than the original and modified to resist the weather, but in harmony with the rest of the design. In the 20th century, his fl\u00e8che was a target for critics.\n\nHe was also criticized later for his modifications of the choir of Notre-Dame, which had been rebuilt in the [[Louis XIV style]] during the reign of that king.   Viollet-le-Duc took out the old choir, including the altar where Napoleon Bonaparte had been crowned Emperor and replaced them with a gothic altar and decoration which he designed.   When he modified the choir, he also constructed new bays with small gothic rose windows modeled on those in the church of [[Chars]], in the Oise Valley.<ref name=\"autogenerated260\"/> Some historians condemned these restorations as non-historical invention. His defenders pointed out that Viollet-le-Duc did not make any decisions on the restoration of Notre-Dame by himself; all of his plans were approved by Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e, the Inspector of Historical Monuments, and by the Commission of historic monuments.{{Sfn|Poisson|2014|pages=218\u2013222}}\n\nHe was criticized for the abundance of gothic gargoyles, chimeras, fleurons, and pinnacles which he added to Notre-Dame Cathedral. These decorations had existed in the Middle Ages but had largely been removed during the reign of Louis XIV.  The last original gargoyles had been taken down in 1813. He modeled the new gargoyles and monsters on examples from other cathedrals of the period.<ref name=\"autogenerated260\"/>\n\nHe was later criticized also for the stained glass windows he designed and had made for the chapels around the ground level of the cathedral, which feature intricate gothic designs in [[grisaille]], which allow more light into the church.  The contemporary view of the controversy of his restoration is summarized on a descriptive panel near the altar of the cathedral: \"The great restoration, carried to fruition by Viollet-le-Duc following the death of Lassus, supplied new radiance to the Cathedral- whatever reservations one might have about the choices that were made. The work of the nineteenth century is now as much a part of the architectural history of Notre-Dame as that undertaken in previous centuries.\"<ref>Descriptive plaque near altar of Notre-Dame, recorded May 22, 2018</ref>\n\nThe restoration of ramparts of [[Carcassonne]] was also criticized in the 20th century. His critics pointed out that the pointed caps of the towers he constructed were more typical of northern France, not the region where Carcassonne was located, near the Spanish border. His critics also claimed that Viollet-le-Duc sought a \"condition of completeness\" which never actually existed at any given time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Social History of Knowledge II: From the Encyclopaedia to Wikipedia|last=Burke|first=Peter|publisher=Wiley|year=2013|isbn=978-0745650432|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\nThe principal counter-argument made by Viollet-le-Duc's defenders was that, without his prompt restorations, many of the buildings that he restored would have been lost, and that he did the best that he could with the knowledge that was then available.\n\n==Existing buildings designed and constructed by Viollet-le-Duc==\n[[File:Paris residence of Viollet-le-Duc.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Residence of Viollet-le-Duc at 68 rue Condorcet, Paris (1862)]]\n* His residence and studio, 68 Rue Condorcet, 9th arrondissement, Paris (1862)\n* 28 rue de Li\u00e8ge, Paris\n* 15 rue de Douai, Paris\n* 23 rue Chauchat, Paris\n\n==Partial list of restorations==\n;Churches\n* [[Abbey of la Madaleine, V\u00e9zelay|Basilica of St. Mary Magdalene]] in [[V\u00e9zelay]]\n* St. Martin in [[Clamecy, Ni\u00e8vre|Clamecy]]\n* [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]] in Paris\n* [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris (under [[F\u00e9lix Duban]])\n* [[Basilica of St. Denis]] near Paris\n* St. Louis in [[Poissy]]\n* Notre-Dame in [[Semur-en-Auxois]]\n* [[Basilica of St. Nazaire and St. Celse, Carcassonne|Basilica of St. Nazarius and St. Celsus]] in [[Carcasonne]]\n* [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse]]\n* [[Lausanne Cathedral|Notre-Dame]] in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland\n;Town halls\n* [[Saint-Antonin-Noble-Val]]\n* [[Narbonne]]\n;Castles\n* [[Ch\u00e2teau de Roquetaillade]], in Bordeaux\n* [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]]\n* Fortified city of [[Carcassonne]]\n* [[Ch\u00e2teau de Coucy]]\n* [[Antoing Castle|Antoing]] in Belgium \n* [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]], Paris\n* [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], Amboise\nRestoration of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]], reinterpreted by Viollet-le-Duc for [[Napoleon&nbsp;III]], was interrupted by the departure of the Emperor in 1870.\n\n==Restorations by Viollet-le-Duc==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" height=\"200px\">\nFile:Notre Dame dalla Senna.jpg|[[Notre-Dame de Paris]] (restored 1845\u20131870)\nFile:Chateau-de-Vincennes-donjon.jpg|The keep of the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Vincennes]] (restored in the 1860s) \nFile:Carcasonneouterwall.jpg|The walled town of [[Carcassonne]] (restored 1853\u20131879)\nFile:St Sernin Toulouse.JPG|[[Basilica of Saint-Sernin, Toulouse]] (restored in the 1860s to the 1880s)\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds vu depuis le Parc.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau de Pierrefonds]] (carried out 1857\u20131885)\nFile:Lausanne-cathe7.JPG|[[Lausanne Cathedral]], Switzerland (Restored 1874\u20131910)\n</gallery>\n\n==Publications==\n[[Image:Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de Architecture peque\u00f1o.png|thumb|upright|Front cover of the ''[[:s:fr:Dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 de l'architecture fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle|Dictionnaire Raisonn\u00e9 de L'Architecture Fran\u00e7aise du XIe au XVIe si\u00e8cle]]'', A.

In [[Henry Van Brunt]]'s translation, the \"Discourses on Architecture\" was published in 1875, making it available to an American audience little more than a decade after its initial publication in France.\n* ''Histoire de l'habitation humaine, depuis les temps pr\u00e9historiques jusqu'\u00e0 nos jours'' (1875). Published in English in 1876 as ''Habitations of Man in All Ages''.

''Entretiens sur l'architecture'']]\nViollet-le-Duc is considered by many to be the first theorist of [[modern architecture]]. Sir [[John Summerson]] wrote that \"there have been two supremely eminent theorists in the history of European architecture \u2013 [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc.\"<ref name=summerson>{{cite book\n | last = Summerson\n | first = Sir John\n | authorlink = John Summerson\n | title = Heavenly Mansions and Other essays on Architecture\n | publisher = Cresset Press\n | year = 1948\n | location = London }}</ref>\n\nHis architectural theory was largely based on finding the ideal forms for specific materials and using these forms to create buildings. His writings centered on the idea that materials should be used \"honestly\". He believed that the outward appearance of a building should reflect the rational construction of the building. In ''Entretiens sur l'architecture'', Viollet-le-Duc praised the [[Greek temple]] for its rational representation of its construction. For him, \"Greek architecture served as a model for the correspondence of structure and appearance.\"<ref>{{cite web\n | last = Ochshorn\n | first = Jonathan\n | title = Designing Building Failures\n | publisher = Cornell University\n | url = http://www.ochshorndesign.com/cornell/writings/failures.html }}</ref> There is speculation that this philosophy was heavily influenced by the writings of [[John Ruskin]], who championed honesty of materials as one of the seven main emphases of architecture.\n\nAnother component in Viollet-le-Duc's theory was how the design of a building should start from its program and the plan, and end with its decorations. If this resulted in an asymmetrical exterior, so be it. He dismissed the symmetry of classicist buildings as vain, caring too much about appearances at the expense of practicality and convenience for the inhabitants of the house.<ref>Hearn, M. F. (ed.), ''The Architectural Theory of Viollet-le-Duc \u2013 Readings and Commentary,'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1990</ref>\n\nIn several unbuilt projects for new buildings, Viollet-le-Duc applied the lessons he had derived from [[Gothic architecture]], applying its rational structural systems to modern building materials such as cast iron. For inspiration, he also examined organic structures, such as leaves and animal skeletons. He was especially interested in the wings of bats, an influence represented by his Assembly Hall project.\n\nViollet-le-Duc's drawings of iron trusswork were innovative for the time. Many of his designs emphasizing iron would later influence the [[Art Nouveau]] movement, most noticeably in the work of [[Hector Guimard]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]] and [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage]]. His writings inspired several American architects, including [[Frank Furness]], [[John Wellborn Root]], [[Louis Sullivan]], and [[Frank Lloyd Wright]].<ref>{{cite book\n | last = Viollet-Le-Duc\n | first = Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel\n | title = The Architectural Theory of Viollet-Le-Duc: Readings and Commentary\n | publisher = MIT Press\n | year = 1990 }}</ref>\n\n==Military career and influence==\nViollet-le-Duc had a second career in the military, primarily in the defense of Paris during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] (1870\u201371). He was so influenced by the conflict that during his later years he described the idealized defense of France by the analogy of the military history of Le Roche-Pont, an imaginary castle, in his work ''Histoire d'une Forteresse'' (''Annals of a Fortress'', twice translated into English). Accessible and well researched, it is partly fictional.\n\n''Annals of a Fortress'' strongly influenced French military defensive thinking. Viollet-le-Duc's critique of the effect of [[artillery]] (applying his practical knowledge from the 1870\u20131871 war) is so complete that it accurately describes the principles applied to the defense of France until World War&nbsp;II. The physical results of his theories are present in the fortification of [[Verdun]] prior to World War&nbsp;I and the [[Maginot Line]] prior to World War&nbsp;II. His theories are also represented by the French military theory of \"Deliberate Advance\", which stresses that artillery and a strong system of [[Fortification|fortresses]] in the rear of an army are essential.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Carcassonne JPG03.jpg|thumb|An imported idiom: Viollet-le-Duc's slate-covered conical towers at [[Carcassonne]]]]\n\nThe English architect [[Benjamin Bucknall]] (1833\u201395) was a devotee of Viollet-le-Duc and during 1874 to 1881 translated several of his publications into English to popularise his principles in Great Britain. The later works of the English designer and architect [[William Burges]] were greatly influenced by Viollet-le-Duc, most strongly in Burges's designs for his own home, [[The Tower House]] in London's Holland Park district, and Burges's designs for [[Castell Coch]] near Cardiff, Wales.<ref name=\"HolEst\">{{cite web| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=49871#s12|title=Survey of London: volume 37: Northern Kensington|publisher=British History Online| accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nAn exhibition, ''Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc 1814\u20131879'' was presented in Paris in 1965, and there was a larger, centennial exhibition in 1980.\n\nViollet-le-Duc was the subject of a [[Google Doodle]] on January 27, 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/eugne-violletleduc-parisian-architect-celebrated-in-google-doodle-9086997.html |title=Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc's 200th birthday: Architect celebrated in Google doodle |first=Rob |last=Williams |work=The Independent |date=27 January 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*{{cite book|last1=Poisson|first1=Georges|last2=Poisson|first2=Olivier|title=Eug\u00e8ne Viollet-le-Duc|year=2014|publisher=Picard|location=Paris|language=French|isbn=978-2-7084-0952-1|ref={{harvid|Poisson|2014}} }}\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Grodecki|first=Louis|title=Dictionnaire des Architectes|year=1999|publisher=Encyclopedia Universalis|language=French|isbn=2-226-10952-8}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/violletleduce.htm Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc] ''Dictionary of Art Historians''\n\n==External links==\n* {{Wikisource inline|Dictionary of French Architecture from the 11th to 16th Century}}\n* {{commons category inline|Viollet-le-Duc}}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Viollet-le-Duc,+E.}}\n* {{Gutenberg author | id=Viollet-le-Duc,+Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel | name=Eug\u00e8ne-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc}}<!--Same person has multiple IDs at PG-->\n* {{Internet Archive author |sname=Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc}}\n* {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Viollet-le-Duc, Eug\u00e8ne Emmanuel|volume=28|pages=107\u2013108}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Viollet-Le-Duc, Eugene}}\n[[Category:1814 births]]\n[[Category:1879 deaths]]\n[[Category:Architects from Paris]]\n[[Category:19th-century French architects]]\n[[Category:French architecture writers]]\n[[Category:French ecclesiastical architects]]\n[[Category:French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War]]\n[[Category:Gothic Revival architects]]\n[[Category:Preservationist architects]]\n[[Category:Recipients of the Royal Gold Medal]]\n[[Category:Honorary Members of the Royal Academy]]", "sha1": "s5abgugzhx2mf39ik4mfqw4m2jkgzqe"}}, {"title": "Endocarditis", "ns": "0", "id": "9659", "revision": {"id": "858627945", "parentid": "843232987", "timestamp": "2018-09-08T15:00:16Z", "contributor": {"username": "JCW-CleanerBot", "id": "31737083"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* Infective endocarditis */[[User:JCW-CleanerBot#Logic|task]], replaced: Heart (British Cardiac Society) \u2192 Heart", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Endocarditis\n| image           = Blood_culture_negative_endocarditis.jpg\n| caption         = ''Bartonella henselae'' bacilli in cardiac valve of a patient with blood culture-negative endocarditis.

Israel enters into a [[biblical covenant|covenant]] with Yahweh who gives them their laws and instructions to build the [[Tabernacle]], the means by which he will come here from heaven and dwell with them and lead them in a holy war to possess the land, and then give them peace.\n\nTraditionally [[Mosaic authorship|ascribed to Moses]] himself, modern scholarship sees the book as initially a product of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] (6th century BCE), based on earlier written and oral traditions, with final revisions in the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian post-exilic period]] (5th century BCE).<ref>Johnstone, p. 72.</ref><ref name=\"Finkelstein, I. p.68\">Finkelstein, p. 68</ref> [[Carol Meyers]] in her commentary on Exodus suggests that it is arguably the most important book in the Bible, as it presents the defining features of Israel's identity: memories of a past marked by hardship and escape, a binding covenant with God, who chooses Israel, and the establishment of the life of the community and the guidelines for sustaining it.<ref>Meyers, p. xv.</ref>\n\n==Name==\n\nThe English name ''Exodus'' comes from the {{lang-grc|\u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}}, ''\u00e9xodos'', meaning \"going out\". In Hebrew the book is called \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, ''sh\u0259m\u014d\u1e6f'', \"Names\", from the [[Incipit|beginning words of the text]]: \"These are the names of the sons of Israel\" ({{lang-he-n|\u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b6\u05bc\u05d4 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc}}).<ref>Dozeman, p. 1.</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nThere is no unanimous agreement among scholars on the structure of Exodus. One strong possibility is that it is a [[diptych]] (i.e., divided into two parts), with the division between parts 1 and 2 at the [[crossing of the Red Sea]] or at the beginning of the [[theophany]] (appearance of God) in chapter 19.<ref>Meyers, p. 17.</ref> On this plan, the first part tells of God's rescue of his people from Egypt and their journey under his care to Sinai (chapters 1\u201319) and the second tells of the covenant between them (chapters 20\u201340).<ref>Stuart, p. 19.</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:1867 Edward Poynter - Israel in Egypt.jpg|thumb|400px|Children of Israel in Egypt (1867 painting by [[Edward Poynter]])]]\n[[Jacob]]'s sons and their families join their brother, [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], in Egypt.  Once there, the Israelites begin to grow in number. Egypt's [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]], fearful that the [[Israelites]] could be a [[fifth column]], forces the Israelites into slavery and orders that all newborn boys be thrown into the [[Nile]]. A [[Levite]] woman (identified elsewhere as [[Jochebed]]) saves her baby by setting him adrift on the river Nile in an [[ark of bulrushes]]. The [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's daughter]] finds the child, names him [[Moses]], and brings him up as her own. But Moses is aware of his origins, and one day, when grown, he kills an Egyptian overseer who is beating a [[Hebrew]] slave and has to flee into [[Midian]]. There he marries [[Zipporah]], the daughter of Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], and encounters God in a [[burning bush]]. Moses asks God for his name: God replies: \"[[I Am that I Am|I AM that I AM]].\" God tells Moses to return to Egypt and lead the Hebrews into [[Canaan]], the land promised to [[Abraham]].\n\nMoses returns to Egypt and fails to convince the Pharaoh to release the Israelites.  God smites the Egyptians with 10 terrible plagues ([[Plagues of Egypt]]) including a river of blood, many frogs, and the death of first-born sons.  Moses leads the Israelites out of bondage after a final chase when the Pharaoh reneges on his coerced consent ([[Parting of the Red Sea|Crossing the Red Sea]] and [[Yam Suph]]). The desert proves arduous, and the Israelites complain and long for Egypt, but God provides [[manna]] and miraculous water for them. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where Moses' father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion Moses appoints [[Biblical judges|judges]] over Israel. God asks whether they will agree to be his people. They accept. The people gather at the foot of the mountain, and with thunder and lightning, fire and clouds of smoke, and the sound of trumpets, and the trembling of the mountain, God appears on the peak, and the people see the cloud and hear the voice [or possibly \"sound\"] of God. Moses is told to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the [[Ten Commandments]] (the [[Ethical Decalogue]]) in the hearing of all Israel. Moses goes up the mountain into the presence of God, who pronounces the [[Covenant Code]] (a detailed code of ritual and civil law), and promises [[Canaan]] to them if they obey. Moses comes down the mountain and writes down God's words and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain where he remains for 40 days and 40 nights. At the conclusion of the 40 days and 40 nights, Moses returns holding the set of stone [[tablet (religious)|tablets]].\n\nGod gives Moses instructions for the construction of the [[tabernacle (Judaism)|tabernacle]] so that God could dwell permanently among his chosen people, as well as instructions for the [[Priestly robe (Judaism)|priestly vestments]], the altar and its appurtenances, the procedure to be used to ordain the priests, and the daily sacrifices to be offered. Aaron is appointed as the first [[High Priest of Israel|hereditary high priest]]. God gives Moses the two tablets of stone containing the words of the ten commandments, written with the [[Finger of God (Commandments)|\"finger of God\"]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|31:18}}; {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|9:10|9}}</ref>\n\nWhile Moses is with God, Aaron makes a [[golden calf]], which the people worship. God informs Moses of their [[apostasy]] and threatens to kill them all, but relents when Moses pleads for them. Moses comes down from the mountain, smashes the stone tablets in anger, and commands the [[Levites]] to massacre the unfaithful Israelites. God commands Moses to make two new tablets on which He will personally write the words that were on the first tablets. Moses ascends the mountain, God dictates the Ten Commandments (the [[Ritual Decalogue]]), and Moses writes them on the tablets.\n\nMoses descends from the mountain, and his face is transformed, so that from that time onwards he has to hide his face with a veil. Moses assembles the Hebrews and repeats to them the commandments he has received from God, which are to keep the [[Sabbath]] and to construct the Tabernacle. \"And all the construction of the Tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished, and the children of Israel did according to everything that God had commanded Moses\", and from that time God dwelt in the Tabernacle and ordered the travels of the Hebrews.\n\n== Composition ==\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Moses]] with the Ten Commandments, by [[Rembrandt]] (1659)]]\n\n=== Authorship ===\nJewish and Christian tradition viewed [[Mosaic authorship|Moses as the author of Exodus]] and the entire Pentateuch, but by the end of the 19th century the increasing awareness of discrepancies, inconsistencies, repetitions and other features of the Pentateuch had led scholars to abandon this idea.<ref>Meyers, p. 16.</ref> In approximate round dates, the process which produced Exodus and the Pentateuch probably began around 600 BCE when existing oral and written traditions were brought together to form books recognisable as those we know, reaching their final form as unchangeable sacred texts around 400 BCE.{{sfn|McEntire|2008|p=8}}\n\n=== Genre and sources ===\nThe story of [[the exodus]] is the [[Origin myth#Founding myth|founding myth]] of Israel, telling how the [[Israelites]] were delivered from slavery by [[Yahweh]] and therefore belong to him through the [[Mosaic covenant]].{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} The Book of Exodus is not a historical narrative in any modern sense:<ref>Fretheim, p. 7.</ref> modern history writing requires the critical evaluation of sources, and does not accept God as a cause of events,<ref name=\"Dozeman\">Dozeman, p. 9.</ref> but in Exodus, everything is presented as the work of God, who appears frequently in person, and the historical setting is only very hazily sketched.<ref>Houston, p. 68.</ref> The purpose of the book is not to record what really happened, but to reflect the historical experience of the exile community in Babylon and later Jerusalem, facing foreign captivity and the need to come to terms with their understanding of God.<ref>Fretheim, p. 8.</ref>\n\nAlthough [[Myth|mythical elements]] are not so prominent in Exodus as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], ancient [[legend]]s have an influence on the book's content: for example, the story of the infant Moses's salvation from the Nile is based on an earlier legend of king [[Sargon of Akkad]], while the story of the [[parting of the Red Sea]] trades on Mesopotamian [[creation myth]]ology.  Similarly, the [[Covenant Code]] (the law code in Exodus 20:22\u201323:33) has some similarities in both content and structure with the [[Laws of Hammurabi]]. These influences serve to reinforce the conclusion that the Book of Exodus originated in the exiled Jewish community of 6th-century BCE [[Babylon]], but not all the sources are Mesopotamian: the story of Moses's flight to Midian following the murder of the Egyptian overseer may draw on the Egyptian ''[[Story of Sinuhe]]''.<ref>Kugler,Hartin, p. 74.</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:David Roberts-IsraelitesLeavingEgypt 1828.jpg|thumb|300px|''Departure of the Israelites'', by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], 1829]]\n\n=== Salvation ===\nBiblical scholars describe the Bible's theologically-motivated history writing as \"[[salvation history]]\", meaning a history of God's saving actions that give identity to Israel \u2013 the promise of offspring and land to the ancestors, [[the exodus]] from Egypt (in which God saves Israel from slavery), the wilderness wandering, the revelation at Sinai, and the hope for the future life in the [[promised land]].<ref name=\"Dozeman\" />\n\n=== Theophany ===\nA [[theophany]] is a manifestation (appearance) of a god \u2013 in the Bible, an appearance of the God of Israel, accompanied by storms \u2013 the earth trembles, the mountains quake, the heavens pour rain, thunder peals and lightning flashes.<ref>Dozeman, p. 4.</ref> The theophany in Exodus begins \"the third day\" from their arrival at Sinai in chapter 19: Yahweh and the people meet at the mountain, God appears in the storm and converses with Moses, giving him the [[Ten Commandments]] while the people listen. The theophany is therefore a public experience of divine law.<ref>Dozeman, p. 427.</ref>\n\nThe second half of Exodus marks the point at which, and describes the process through which, God's theophany becomes a permanent presence for Israel via the [[Tabernacle]]. That so much of the book (chapters 25\u201331, 35\u201340) is spent describing the plans of the Tabernacle demonstrates the importance it played in the perception of [[Second Temple Judaism]] at the time of the text's redaction by the Priestly writers: the Tabernacle is the place where God is physically present, where, through the priesthood, Israel could be in direct, literal communion with him.<ref>Dempster, p. 107.</ref>\n\n=== Covenant ===\nThe heart of Exodus is the [[Mosaic covenant|Sinaitic covenant]].<ref>Wenham, p. 29.</ref> A covenant is a legal document binding two parties to take on certain obligations towards each other.<ref>Meyers, p. 148.</ref> There are several covenants in the Bible, and in each case they exhibit at least some of the elements found in real-life treaties of the ancient Middle East: a preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, deposition and reading, list of witnesses, blessings and curses, and ratification by animal sacrifice.<ref>Meyers, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref> Biblical covenants, in contrast to Eastern covenants in general, are between a god, Yahweh, and a people, Israel, instead of between a strong ruler and a weaker vassal.<ref>Meyers, p. 150.</ref>\n\n=== Election of Israel ===\nIsrael is elected for salvation because the \"sons of Israel\" are \"the firstborn son\" of the God of Israel, descended through Shem and Abraham to the chosen line of [[Jacob]] whose name is changed to Israel. The goal of the divine plan as revealed in Exodus is a return to humanity's state in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], so that God can dwell with the Israelites as he had with [[Adam and Eve]] through the Ark and Tabernacle, which together form a model of the universe; in later [[Abrahamic religion]]s this came to be interpreted as Israel being the guardian of God's plan for humanity, to bring \"God's creation blessing to mankind\" begun in Adam.<ref>Dempster, p. 100.</ref>\n\n== Contents according to Judaism's weekly Torah portions ==\n[[File:The Crossing fo The Red Sea.jpg|thumb|300px|''Crossing of the Red Sea'', [[Nicholas Poussin]]]]\n\n{{main|Weekly Torah portion}}\n\n:*[[Shemot (parsha)|Shemot]], on Exodus 1\u20135: Affliction in Egypt, Moses is found and called, Pharaoh\n:*[[Va'eira (parsha)|Va'eira]], on Exodus 6\u20139: Plagues 1 to 7 of Egypt\n:*[[Bo (parsha)|Bo]], on Exodus 10\u201313: Last plagues of Egypt, first Passover\n:*[[Beshalach (parsha)|Beshalach]], on Exodus 13\u201317: Parting the Sea, water, manna, Amalek\n:*[[Yitro (parsha)|Yitro]], on Exodus 18\u201320: Jethro\u2019s advice, The Ten Commandments\n:*[[Mishpatim (parsha)|Mishpatim]], on Exodus 21\u201324: The Covenant Code\n:*[[Terumah (parsha)|Terumah]], on Exodus 25\u201327: God's instructions on the Tabernacle and furnishings\n:*[[Tetzaveh (parsha)|Tetzaveh]], on Exodus 27\u201330: God's instructions on the first priests\n:*[[Ki Tissa]], on Exodus 30\u201334: Census, anointing oil, golden calf, stone tablets, Moses radiant\n:*[[Vayakhel (parsha)|Vayakhel]], on Exodus 35\u201338: Israelites collect gifts, make the Tabernacle and furnishings\n:*[[Pekudei (parsha)|Pekudei]], on Exodus 38\u201340: The Tabernacle is set up and filled\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[The Exodus]]\n* [[Ketef Hinnom]]\n* [[Moses]]\n* [[Song of the sea]]\n* [[Tabernacle]]\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses and the 40 years in the desert|Film adaptations of the Book of Exodus]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Egypt#Ancient times|History of the Jews in Ancient Egypt]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Childs|first=Brevard S|title=The Book of Exodus|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1979|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z7sKWo7FRAgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Childs+Exodus#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780664229689}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Dempster|first=Stephen G|author-link=Stephen Dempster|title=Dominion and Dynasty|publisher=InterVarsity Press|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/?id=G329hmhyBa8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Dominion+and+dynasty#v=onepage&q=Dominion%20and%20dynasty&f=false|isbn=9780830826155}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Dozeman|first=Thomas B|title=Commentary on Exodus|publisher=Eerdmans|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRXjfa6RWPwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Exodus#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=9780802826176}}\n*Finkelstein, I., Silberman, NA., (2001).

Commonly, electronic devices contain circuitry consisting primarily or exclusively of active [[semiconductor]]s supplemented with passive elements; such a circuit is described as an [[electronic circuit]].\n\nThe [[nonlinear]] behaviour of active components and their ability to control electron flows makes amplification of weak signals possible.  Electronics is widely used in [[information processing]], [[telecommunication]], and [[signal processing]].  The ability of electronic devices to act as [[switch]]es makes digital information-processing possible.  Interconnection technologies such as [[circuit board]]s, electronics packaging technology, and other varied forms of communication infrastructure complete circuit functionality and transform the mixed components into a regular working [[system]].\n\n[[Electricity|Electrical]] and [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] science and technology deals with the generation, distribution, switching, storage, and conversion of electrical energy to and from other energy forms (using [[wire]]s, [[Electric motor|motors]], [[Electric generator|generator]]s, [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[switch]]es, [[relay]]s, [[transformer]]s, [[resistor]]s, and other [[passive component]]s). This distinction started around 1906 with the invention by [[Lee De Forest]] of the [[triode]], which made electrical [[Amplifier|amplification]] of weak radio signals and audio signals possible with a non-mechanical device.  Until 1950 this field was called \"radio technology\" because its principal application was the design and theory of radio [[transmitter]]s, [[Receiver (radio)|receivers]], and [[vacuum tube]]s.\n\n{{As of | 2018}} most electronic devices use [[semiconductor]] components to perform electron control.  The study of semiconductor devices and related technology is considered a branch of [[solid-state physics]], whereas the design and construction of [[electronic circuit]]s to solve practical problems come under [[electronics engineering]].  This article focuses on [[engineering]] aspects of electronics.\n\n== Branches of electronics ==\nElectronics has branches as follows:\n\n#[[Digital electronics]]\n#[[Analogue electronics]]\n#[[Microelectronics]]\n#[[Circuit design]]\n#[[Integrated circuit]]s\n#[[Power electronics]]\n#[[Optoelectronics]]\n#[[Semiconductor device]]s\n#[[Embedded system]]s\n\n== Electronic devices and components ==\n[[File:US Navy 080820-N-9079D-007 Electronics Technician 3rd Class Michael J.

Components are generally intended to be connected together, usually by being soldered to a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB), to create an electronic circuit with a particular function (for example an [[amplifier]], [[radio receiver]], or [[Electronic oscillator|oscillator]]). Components may be packaged singly, or in more complex groups as [[integrated circuit]]s. Some common electronic components are [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s, [[resistor]]s, [[diode]]s, [[transistor]]s, etc. Components are often categorized as active (e.g. transistors and [[thyristor]]s) or [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] (e.g. resistors, diodes, inductors and capacitors).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/9780470547113|title=Power Electronics and Variable Frequency Drives: Technology and Applications - Wiley Online Library|language=en|doi=10.1002/9780470547113}}</ref>\n\n== History of electronic components ==\n{{Further|History of electronic engineering|Timeline of electrical and electronic engineering}}\n\n[[Vacuum tube]]s (Thermionic valves) were among the earliest electronic components.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Guarnieri|first=M.|date=2012|title=The age of vacuum tubes: Early devices and the rise of radio communications|journal=IEEE Ind.

Vacuum tubes are still used in some specialist applications such as [[Valve RF amplifier|high power RF amplifiers]], [[cathode ray tube]]s, specialist audio equipment, [[guitar amplifiers]] and some [[Cavity magnetron|microwave devices]].\n\nIn April 1955, the [[IBM 608]] was the first [[IBM]] product to use [[transistor]] circuits without any vacuum tubes and is believed to be the first all-transistorized [[calculator]] to be manufactured for the commercial market.<ref>{{cite book |last= Bashe |first= Charles J.  |title=IBM's Early Computers |publisher= MIT |year= 1986 |page=386 |ref=harv |display-authors=etal}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Pugh |first1=Emerson W. |last2=Johnson |first2=Lyle R. |last3=Palmer |first3=John H. |year=1991 |title=IBM's 360 and early 370 systems |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-16123-0 |page=34 |ref=harv }}</ref> The 608 contained more than 3,000 [[germanium]] transistors.  [[Thomas J. Watson Jr.]] ordered all future IBM products to use transistors in their design.  From that time on transistors were almost exclusively used for computer logic and peripherals.\n\n== Types of circuits ==\nCircuits and components can be divided into two groups: analog and digital. A particular device may consist of circuitry that has one or the other or a mix of the two types.\n\n=== Analog circuits ===\n{{Main|Analog electronics}}\n[[File:HitachiJ100A.jpg|right|thumb|Hitachi J100 adjustable frequency drive chassis]]\nMost [[analog signal|analog]] electronic appliances, such as [[radio]] receivers, are constructed from combinations of a few types of basic circuits. [[Analog circuits]] use a continuous range of voltage or current as opposed to discrete levels as in digital circuits.\n\nThe number of different analog circuits so far devised is huge, especially because a 'circuit' can be defined as anything from a single component, to systems containing thousands of components.\n\nAnalog circuits are sometimes called [[linear circuit]]s although many non-linear effects are used in analog circuits such as mixers, modulators, etc. Good examples of analog circuits include vacuum tube and transistor amplifiers, operational amplifiers and oscillators.\n\nOne rarely finds modern circuits that are entirely analog. These days analog circuitry may use digital or even microprocessor techniques to improve performance. This type of circuit is usually called \"mixed signal\" rather than analog or digital.\n\nSometimes it may be difficult to differentiate between analog and digital circuits as they have elements of both linear and non-linear operation. An example is the comparator which takes in a continuous range of voltage but only outputs one of two levels as in a digital circuit. Similarly, an overdriven transistor amplifier can take on the characteristics of a controlled [[switch]] having essentially two levels of output.  In fact, many digital circuits are actually implemented as variations of analog circuits similar to this example&mdash;after all, all aspects of the real physical world are essentially analog, so digital effects are only realized by constraining analog behavior.\n\n=== Digital circuits ===\n{{Main|Digital electronics}}\nDigital circuits are electric circuits based on a number of discrete voltage levels. Digital circuits are the most common physical representation of [[Boolean logic|Boolean algebra]], and are the basis of all digital computers. To most engineers, the terms \"digital circuit\", \"digital system\" and \"logic\" are interchangeable in the context of digital circuits.\nMost digital circuits use a binary system with two voltage levels labeled \"0\" and \"1\". Often logic \"0\" will be a lower voltage and referred to as \"Low\" while logic \"1\" is referred to as \"High\".  However, some systems use the reverse definition (\"0\" is \"High\") or are current based.  Quite often the logic designer may reverse these definitions from one circuit to the next as he sees fit to facilitate his design.  The definition of the levels as \"0\" or \"1\" is arbitrary.\n\n[[Ternary computer|Ternary]] (with three states) logic has been studied, and some prototype computers made.\n\n[[Computer]]s, electronic [[quartz clock|clocks]], and [[programmable logic controller]]s (used to control industrial processes) are constructed of [[Digital data|digital]] circuits. [[Digital signal processor]]s are another example.\n\nBuilding blocks:\n* [[Logic gate]]s\n* [[Adder (electronics)|Adders]]\n* [[Flip-flop (electronics)|Flip-flops]]\n* [[Counter (digital)|Counter]]s\n* [[Processor register|Registers]]\n* [[Multiplexer]]s\n* [[Schmitt trigger]]s\n\nHighly integrated devices:\n* [[Microprocessor]]s\n* [[Microcontroller]]s\n* [[Application-specific integrated circuit]] (ASIC)\n* [[Digital signal processor]] (DSP)\n* [[Field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA)\n\n== Heat dissipation and thermal management ==\n{{Main|Thermal management of electronic devices and systems}}\n[[Heat]] generated by electronic circuitry must be dissipated to prevent immediate failure and improve long term reliability. Heat dissipation is mostly achieved by passive conduction/convection. Means to achieve greater dissipation include [[heat sink]]s and [[Mechanical fan|fans]] for air cooling, and other forms of [[computer cooling]] such as [[water cooling]]. These techniques use [[convection]], [[Heat conduction|conduction]], and [[radiation]] of heat energy.\n\n== Noise ==\n{{Main|Electronic noise}}\nElectronic noise is defined<ref>IEEE Dictionary of Electrical and Electronics Terms {{ISBN|978-0-471-42806-0}}</ref> as unwanted disturbances superposed on a useful signal that tend to obscure its information content. Noise is not the same as signal distortion caused by a circuit. Noise is associated with all electronic circuits. Noise may be electromagnetically or thermally generated, which can be decreased by lowering the [[operating temperature]] of the circuit. Other types of noise, such as [[shot noise]] cannot be removed as they are due to limitations in physical properties.\n\n== Electronics theory ==\n{{Main|Mathematical methods in electronics}}\n\nMathematical methods are integral to the study of electronics. To become proficient in electronics it is also necessary to become proficient in the mathematics of circuit analysis.\n\nCircuit analysis is the study of methods of solving generally linear systems for unknown variables such as the voltage at a certain [[Node (circuits)|node]] or the current through a certain [[Path (graph theory)|branch]] of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|network]]. A common analytical tool for this is the [[SPICE]] circuit simulator.\n\nAlso important to electronics is the study and understanding of [[electromagnetic field]] theory.\n\n== Electronics lab ==\n{{Main|Electronic circuit simulation}}\n\nDue to the complex nature of electronics theory, laboratory experimentation is an important part of the development of electronic devices.  These experiments are used to test or verify the engineer\u2019s design and detect errors.  Historically, electronics labs have consisted of electronics devices and equipment located in a physical space, although in more recent years the trend has been towards electronics lab simulation software, such as [[CircuitLogix]], [[Multisim]], and [[PSpice]].\n\n== Computer aided design (CAD) ==\n{{Main|Electronic design automation}}\n\nToday's electronics engineers have the ability to [[Circuit design|design]] [[Electronic circuit|circuits]] using premanufactured building blocks such as [[power supply|power supplies]], [[semiconductor]]s (i.e. semiconductor devices, such as [[transistor]]s), and [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Electronic design automation]] software programs include [[schematic capture]] programs and [[printed circuit board]] design programs. Popular names in the EDA software world are NI Multisim, Cadence ([[ORCAD]]), [[EAGLE (program)|EAGLE]] PCB and Schematic, Mentor (PADS PCB and LOGIC Schematic), Altium (Protel), LabCentre Electronics (Proteus), gEDA, KiCad and many others.\n\n== Packaging methods ==\n{{Main|Electronic packaging}}\nMany different methods of connecting components have been used over the years. For instance, early electronics often used [[Point-to-point construction|point to point wiring]] with components attached to wooden breadboards to construct circuits. [[Printed circuit board#\"Cordwood\" construction|Cordwood construction]] and [[wire wrap]] were other methods used. Most modern day electronics now use printed circuit boards made of materials such as [[FR-4|FR4]], or the cheaper (and less hard-wearing) Synthetic Resin Bonded Paper ([[SRBP]], also known as Paxoline/Paxolin (trade marks) and FR2) - characterised by its brown colour. Health and environmental concerns associated with electronics assembly have gained increased attention in recent years, especially for products destined to the European Union, with its [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) and [[Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive]] (WEEE), which went into force in July 2006.\n\n== Electronic systems design ==\n{{Main|Systems engineering}}\nElectronic systems design deals with the multi-disciplinary design issues of complex electronic devices, such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s. The subject covers a broad spectrum, from the design and development of an electronic system ([[new product development]]) to assuring its proper function, service life and [[Recycling|disposal]].<ref name=\"lienig\">{{Cite book|author=J.

In the novel, it is not revealed where Erewhon is, but it is clear that it is a [[fictional country]]. Butler meant the title to be understood as the word \"nowhere\" backwards even though the letters \"h\" and \"w\" are transposed.<!-- The common pronunciation of \"wh\" in his day transposed the two letters, while articulating both.  /\u02c8no\u028a\u02cchwe\u0259r/  -->  The book is a satire on [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] society.<ref>George Orwell, ''Erewhon'', BBC Home Service, Talks for Schools, 8 June 1945</ref>\n\nThe first few chapters of the novel dealing with the discovery of Erewhon are in fact based on Butler's own experiences in New Zealand where, as a young man, he worked as a [[sheep station|sheep farmer]] on Mesopotamia Station for about four years (1860\u201364), and explored parts of the interior of the [[South Island]] and which he wrote about in his ''A First Year in Canterbury Settlement'' (1863).\n\n==Content==\nThe greater part of the book consists of a description of Erewhon. The nature of this nation is intended to be ambiguous. At first glance, Erewhon appears to be a [[Utopia]], yet it soon becomes clear that this is far from the case. Yet for all the failings of Erewhon, it is also clearly not a [[dystopia]], such as that depicted in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. As a satirical utopia, ''Erewhon'' has sometimes been compared to ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), a classic novel by [[Jonathan Swift]]; the image of Utopia in this latter case also bears strong parallels with the self-view of the [[British Empire]] at the time. It can also be compared to the [[William Morris]] novel, ''[[News from Nowhere]]''.\n\n''Erewhon'' satirises various aspects of [[Victorian era|Victorian society]], including criminal punishment, religion and [[anthropocentrism]]. For example, according to Erewhonian law, offenders are treated as if they were ill, whereas ill people are looked upon as criminals. Another feature of Erewhon is the absence of machines; this is due to the widely shared perception by the Erewhonians that they are potentially dangerous. This last aspect of ''Erewhon'' reveals the influence of [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolution theory; Butler had read ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' soon after it was published in 1859.\n\n===The Book of the Machines===\nButler developed the three chapters of ''Erewhon'' that make up \"The Book of the Machines\" from a number of articles that he had contributed to ''[[The Press]]'', which had just begun publication in [[Christchurch]], New Zealand, beginning with \"[[Darwin among the Machines]]\" (1863). Butler was the first to write about the possibility that [[Artificial consciousness|machines might develop consciousness]] by [[Charles Darwin|Darwinian selection]].<ref>''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6173 \"Darwin among the Machines\"], reprinted in the Notebooks of Samuel Butler at [[Project Gutenberg]]</ref> Many dismissed this as a joke; but, in his preface to the second edition, Butler wrote, \"I regret that reviewers have in some cases been inclined to treat the chapters on Machines as an attempt to reduce Mr. Darwin's theory to an absurdity. Nothing could be further from my intention, and few things would be more distasteful to me than any attempt to laugh at Mr. Darwin.\"\n\n===Characters===\n* Higgs\u2014The narrator who informs the reader of the nature of Erewhonian society.\n* Chowbok (Kahabuka)\u2014Higgs' guide into the mountains; he is a native who greatly fears the Erewhonians. He eventually abandons Higgs.\n* Yram\u2014The daughter of Higgs' jailer who takes care of him when he first enters Erewhon. Her name is Mary spelled backwards.\n* Senoj Nosnibor\u2014Higgs' host after he is released from prison; he hopes that Higgs will marry his elder daughter. His name is Robinson Jones backwards.\n* Zulora\u2014Senoj Nosnibor's elder daughter\u2014Higgs finds her unpleasant, but her father hopes Higgs will marry her. Her name is Aroluz backwards.\n* Arowhena\u2014Senoj Nosnibor's younger daughter; she falls in love with Higgs and runs away with him.\n* Mahaina\u2014A woman who claims to suffer from alcoholism but is believed to have a weak temperament.\n* Ydgrun\u2014The incomprehensible goddess of the Erewhonians. Her name is an anagram of Grundy (from [[Mrs. Grundy]], a character in [[Thomas Morton (playwright)|Thomas Morton]]'s play ''[[Speed the Plough]]'').\n\n==Reception==\nAfter its first release, this book sold far better than any of Butler's other works,{{clarify|date=February 2013}} perhaps because the British public assumed that the anonymous author was some better-known figure{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} (the favourite being [[Lord Lytton]], who had published ''[[The Coming Race]]'' two years previously). In a 1945 broadcast, [[George Orwell]] praised the book and said that when Butler wrote ''Erewhon'' it needed \"imagination of a very high order to see that machinery could be dangerous as well as useful.\" He recommended the novel, though not its sequel, ''[[Erewhon Revisited]]''.<ref>Orwell, Collected Works, I Belong to the Left, pp. 172\u2013173</ref>\n\n==Influence and legacy==\nThe French philosopher [[Gilles Deleuze]] used ideas from Butler's book at various points in the development of his philosophy of difference. In ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'' (1968), Deleuze refers to what he calls \"Ideas\" as \"Erewhon\". \"Ideas are not concepts\", he argues, but rather \"a form of eternally positive differential [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]], distinguished from the identity of concepts.\"<ref>Deleuze (1968, p. 288).</ref> \"Erewhon\" refers to the \"nomadic distributions\" that pertain to [[Simulacrum|simulacra]], which \"are not [[Universal (metaphysics)|universals]] like the [[Category (Kant)|categories]], nor are they the ''hic et nunc'' or ''nowhere'', the diversity to which categories apply in representation.\"<ref>Deleuze (1968, p. 285).</ref> \"Erewhon\", in this reading, is \"not only a disguised ''no-where'' but a rearranged ''now-here''.\"<ref>Deleuze (1968, p. 333, n.7).</ref>\n\nIn his collaboration with [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]], ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), Deleuze draws on Butler's \"The Book of the Machines\" to \"go beyond\" the \"usual polemic between [[vitalism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]\" as it relates to their concept of \"[[Desiring-production|desiring-machines]]\":<ref>Deleuze and Guattari (1972, pp. 312\u2013314).</ref>\n{{quote|For one thing, Butler is not content to say that machines extend the [[organism]], but asserts that they are really limbs and organs lying on the [[body without organs]] of a society, which men will appropriate according to their power and their wealth, and whose poverty deprives them as if they were mutilated organisms. For another, he is not content to say that organisms are machines, but asserts that they contain such an abundance of parts that they must be compared to very different parts of distinct machines, each relating to the others, engendered in combination with the others ...

The [[EC-hippocampus system]] plays an important role in declarative (autobiographical/episodic/semantic) memories and in particular [[spatial memory|spatial memories]] including [[memory formation]], [[memory consolidation]], and memory optimization in [[sleep]]. The EC is also responsible for the pre-processing (familiarity) of the input signals in the reflex [[nictitating membrane]] response of classical trace conditioning, the association of impulses from the [[Human eye|eye]] and the [[ear]] occurs in the entorhinal cortex.\n\n==Structure==\nIn rodents, the EC is located at the [[Caudal (anatomical term)|caudal]] end of the [[temporal lobe]].

Although Haeckel's ideas are important to the history of [[evolutionary theory]], and although he was a competent [[invertebrate]] [[anatomist]] most famous for his work on [[radiolaria]], many speculative concepts that he championed are now considered incorrect. For example, Haeckel described and named hypothetical ancestral [[microorganism]]s that have never been found.\n\nHe was one of the first to consider [[psychology]] as a branch of [[physiology]]. He also proposed the kingdom ''[[Protista]]''<ref name=HaeckelDE /> in 1866. His chief interests lay in [[evolution]] and life development processes in general, including development of nonrandom form, which culminated in the beautifully illustrated ''[[Kunstformen der Natur]]'' (''Art forms of nature''). Haeckel did not support [[natural selection]], rather believing in [[Lamarckism]].<ref>Ruse, M. 1979. ''The Darwinian Revolution''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.</ref>\n\n[[File:Haeckel vs von Baer.svg|thumb|upright=2.0|Embryology theories of Ernst Haeckel and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] compared]]\n\nHaeckel advanced a version of the earlier [[recapitulation theory]] previously set out by [[\u00c9tienne Serres]] in the 1820s and supported by followers of [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] including [[Robert Edmond Grant]].<ref>{{harvnb|Desmond|1989|pp=53\u201353, 86\u201388, 337\u2013340}}</ref> It proposed a link between [[ontogeny]] (development of form) and [[phylogeny]] (evolutionary descent), summed up by Haeckel in the phrase \"[[ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny]]\". His concept of recapitulation has been refuted in the form he gave it (now called \"strong recapitulation\"), in favour of the ideas [[Karl Ernst von Baer#Baer's laws (embryology)|first advanced by Karl Ernst von Baer]]. The strong recapitulation hypothesis views ontogeny as repeating forms of adult ancestors, while weak recapitulation means that what is repeated (and built upon) is the ancestral embryonic development process.<ref>Richardson and Keuck, (Biol. Review (2002), 77, pp. 495\u2013528) show that it is a simplification to suppose that Haeckel held the recapitulation theory in its strong form. They quote Haeckel as saying \"If [recapitulation] was always complete, it would be a very easy task to construct whole phylogeny on the basis of ontogeny.  \u2026 There is certainly, even now, a number of lower vertebrate animals (e.g. some Anthozoa and Vermes) where we are authorised to interpret each embryological form directly as the historical representation or portrait-like silhouette of an extinct ancestral form. But in a great majority of animals, including man, this is not possible because the infinitely varied conditions of existence have led the embryonic forms themselves to be changed and to partly lose their original condition (Haeckel, 1903: pp. 435\u2013436)\"</ref> Haeckel supported the theory with [[embryo drawings]] that have since been shown to be oversimplified and in part inaccurate, and the theory is now considered an oversimplification of quite complicated relationships. Haeckel introduced the concept of [[heterochrony]], the change in timing of [[embryonic development]] over the course of evolution.<ref name=Horder>{{cite book |author=Horder, Tim |chapter=Heterochrony |title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |date=April 2006 }}</ref><ref name=\"Hall 2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=B.

For example, at the time when Darwin published ''[[On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection]]'' (1859), Haeckel postulated that evidence of human evolution would be found in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]).  At that time, no remains of human ancestors had yet been identified.  He described these theoretical remains in great detail and even named the as-yet unfound species, ''Pithecanthropus alalus'', and instructed his students such as [[Richard Hertwig|Richard]] and [[Oskar Hertwig]] to go and find it.\n\nOne student did find some remains: a Dutchman named [[Eug\u00e8ne Dubois]] searched the [[East Indies]] from 1887 to 1895, discovering the remains of [[Java Man]] in 1891, consisting of a skullcap, thighbone, and a few teeth. These remains are among the oldest hominid remains ever found. Dubois classified Java Man with Haeckel's ''Pithecanthropus'' label, though they were later reclassified as ''[[Homo erectus]]''. Some scientists of the day suggested<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=N26AAAAAMAAJ The red ape: orang-utans and human origins, Jeffrey H. Schwartz]</ref> Dubois' Java Man as a potential intermediate form between modern humans and the common ancestor we share with the other [[great apes]]. The current consensus of anthropologists is that the direct ancestors of modern humans were African populations of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (possibly ''[[Homo ergaster]]''), rather than the Asian populations exemplified by Java Man and [[Peking Man]]. (Ironically, a new human species, [[Homo floresiensis]], a dwarf human type, has recently been discovered in the island of Flores).\n\n== Polygenism and racial theory ==\n<!--- The article Charles Darwin links to this section. Please do not change the title of this section without adding an appropriate anchor or making appropriate amendments to all the articles which link to it.  --->\nThe [[creationism|creationist]] [[polygenism]] of [[Samuel George Morton]] and [[Louis Agassiz]], which presented human [[race (classification of human beings)|races]] as separately created [[species]], was rejected by [[Charles Darwin]], who argued for the [[Monogenism|monogenesis]] of the [[human]] species and the [[recent African origin of modern humans|African origin of modern humans]]. In contrast to most of Darwin's supporters, Haeckel put forward a doctrine of evolutionary polygenism based on the ideas of the linguist [[August Schleicher]], in which several different language groups had arisen separately from speechless prehuman ''Urmenschen'' ({{lang-de|proto-humans}}), which themselves had evolved from simian ancestors. These separate languages had completed the transition from animals to man, and, under the influence of each main branch of languages, humans had evolved \u2013 in a kind of [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] use-inheritance \u2013 as separate species, which could be subdivided into races. From this, Haeckel drew the implication that languages with the most potential yield the human races with the most potential, led by the Semitic and Indo-Germanic groups, with Berber, Jewish, Greco-Roman and Germanic varieties to the fore.<ref name=TTSL>{{cite book |author=Richards, Robert W. |title=The Tragic Sense of Life: Ernst Haeckel and the Struggle over Evolutionary Thought |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=2008 |pages=259\u2013260 |isbn=0-226-71214-1 }}</ref> As Haeckel stated:<ref>''Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte'' (1868), p. 511; quoted after Robert J.

With each of these human species, language developed on its own and independently of the others. At least this is the view of Schleicher, one of the foremost authorities on this subject.\u2026 If one views the origin of the branches of language as the special and principal act of becoming human, and the species of humankind as distinguished according to their language stem, then one can say that the different species of men arose independently of one another.}}\n\nHaeckel's view can be seen as a forerunner of the views of [[Carleton S.

Developmental series were used to show stages within a species, but inconsistent views and stages made it even more difficult to compare different species. It was agreed by all European evolutionists that all [[vertebrate]]s looked very similar at an early stage, in what was thought of as a common ideal type, but there was a continuing debate from the 1820s between the Romantic [[recapitulation theory]] that human embryos developed through stages of the forms of all the major groups of adult animals, literally manifesting a sequence of organisms on a [[great chain of being|linear chain of being]], and [[Karl Ernst von Baer]]'s opposing view, stated in [[von Baer's laws (embryology)|von Baer's laws of embryology]], that the early general forms diverged into four major groups of specialised forms without ever resembling the adult of another species, showing affinity to an [[archetype]] but no relation to other types or any [[transmutation of species]]. By the time Haeckel was teaching he was able to use a textbook with woodcut illustrations written by his own teacher [[Albert von K\u00f6lliker]], which purported to explain human development while also using other mammalian embryos to claim a coherent sequence. Despite the significance to ideas of transformism, this was not really polite enough for the new popular science writing, and was a matter for medical institutions and for experts who could make their own comparisons.<ref name=hopwood2006 />{{rp|264\u2013267}}<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2011|p=450}}</ref>\n\n=== Darwin, Naturphilosophie and Lamarck ===\n\nDarwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', which made a powerful impression on Haeckel when he read it in 1864, was very cautious about the possibility of ever reconstructing the history of life, but did include a section reinterpreting von Baer's embryology and revolutionising the field of study, concluding that \"Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we thus look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscured, of the common parent-form of each great class of animals.\" It mentioned von Baer's 1828 anecdote (misattributing it to [[Louis Agassiz]]) that at an early stage embryos were so similar that it could be impossible to tell whether an unlabelled specimen was of a mammal, a bird, or of a reptile, and Darwin's own research using embryonic stages of [[barnacle]]s to show that they are [[crustacean]]s, while cautioning against the idea that one organism or embryonic stage is \"higher\" or \"lower\", or more or less evolved.<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1859|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F373&pageseq=457 439\u2013450]}}<br />{{harvnb|Darwin|Costa|2011|pp=439\u2013450}}</ref> Haeckel disregarded such caution, and in a year wrote his massive and ambitious ''Generelle Morphologie'', published in 1866, presenting a revolutionary new synthesis of Darwin's ideas with the German tradition of ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'' going back to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] and with the progressive evolutionism of [[Lamarckism|Lamarck]] in what he called ''Darwinismus''. He used [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] to reconstruct the [[evolutionary history of life]], in the absence of fossil evidence using embryology as evidence of ancestral relationships. He invented new terms, including [[ontogeny]] and [[phylogeny]], to present his evolutionised recapitulation theory that \"ontogeny recapitulated phylogeny\". The two massive volumes sold poorly, and were heavy going: with his limited understanding of German, Darwin found them impossible to read. Haeckel's publisher turned down a proposal for a \"''strictly scholarly'' and ''objective''\" second edition.<ref name=hopwood2006 />{{rp|269\u2013270}}\n\n=== Embryological drawings ===\n[[File:Tree of life by Haeckel.jpg|upright|thumb|Haeckel's [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]]]\n\nHaeckel's aim was a reformed morphology with evolution as the organising principle of a cosmic synthesis unifying science, religion, and art. He was giving successful \"popular lectures\" on his ideas to students and townspeople in [[Jena]], in an approach pioneered by his teacher [[Rudolf Virchow]]. To meet his publisher's need for a popular work he used a student's transcript of his lectures as the basis of his ''Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte'' of 1868, presenting a comprehensive presentation of evolution. In the Spring of that year he drew figures for the book, synthesising his views of specimens in Jena and published pictures to represent types. After publication he told a colleague that the images \"are completely exact, partly copied from nature, partly assembled from all illustrations of these early stages that have hitherto become known.\" There were various styles of [[embryological drawings]] at that time, ranging from more schematic representations to \"naturalistic\" illustrations of specific specimens. Haeckel believed privately that his figures were both exact and synthetic, and in public asserted that they were schematic like most figures used in teaching. The images were reworked to match in size and orientation, and though displaying Haeckel's own views of essential features, they support von Baer's concept that vertebrate embryos begin similarly and then diverge. Relating different images on a grid conveyed a powerful evolutionary message. As a book for the general public, it followed the common practice of not citing sources.<ref name=hopwood2006 />{{rp|270\u2013274}}\n\n[[File:Embryo - copies.jpg|thumb|left|In 1868 Haeckel illustrated von Baer's observation that early embryos of different species could not be told apart by using the same woodcut three times as dog, chick and turtle embryos: he changed this in the next edition.]]\nThe book sold very well, and while some anatomical experts hostile to Haeckel's evolutionary views expressed some private concerns that certain figures had been drawn rather freely, the figures showed what they already knew about similarities in embryos. The first published concerns came from [[Ludwig R\u00fctimeyer]], a professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the [[University of Basel]] who had placed fossil mammals in an evolutionary lineage early in the 1860s and had been sent a complimentary copy. At the end of 1868 his review in the ''Archiv f\u00fcr Anthropologie'' wondered about the claim that the work was \"popular and scholarly\", doubting whether the second was true, and expressed horror about such public discussion of man's place in nature with illustrations such as the evolutionary trees being shown to non-experts. Though he made no suggestion that embryo illustrations should be directly based on specimens, to him the subject demanded the utmost \"scrupulosity and conscientiousness\" and an artist must \"not arbitrarily model or generalise his originals for speculative purposes\" which he considered proved by comparison with works by other authors. In particular, \"one and the same, moreover incorrectly interpreted woodcut, is presented to the reader three times in a row and with three different captions as [the] embryo of the dog, the chick, [and] the turtle.\" He accused Haeckel of \"playing fast and loose with the public and with science\", and failing to live up to the obligation to the truth of every serious researcher. Haeckel responded with angry accusations of bowing to religious prejudice, but in the second (1870) edition changed the duplicated embryo images to a single image captioned \"embryo of a mammal or bird\". Duplication using galvanoplastic stereotypes ([[Stereotype (printing)|clich\u00e9s]]) was a common technique in textbooks, but not on the same page to represent different eggs or embryos. In 1891 Haeckel made the excuse that this \"extremely rash foolishness\" had occurred in undue haste but was \"bona fide\", and since repetition of incidental details was obvious on close inspection, it is unlikely to have been intentional deception.<ref name=hopwood2006 />{{rp|275\u2013276;282\u2013286}}\n\nThe revised 1870 second edition of 1,500 copies attracted more attention, being quickly followed by further revised editions with larger print runs as the book became a prominent part of the optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical \"culture of progress\" in [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s new [[German Empire]]. The similarity of early vertebrate embryos became common knowledge, and the illustrations were praised by experts such as [[Michael Foster (physiologist)|Michael Foster]] of the [[University of Cambridge]]. In the introduction to his 1871 ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex]]'', Darwin gave particular praise to Haeckel, writing that if ''Nat\u00fcrliche Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte'' \"had appeared before my essay had been written, I should probably never have completed it.\" The first chapter included an illustration: \"As some of my readers may never have seen a drawing of an embryo, I have given one of man and another of a dog, at about the same early stage of development, carefully copied from two works of undoubted accuracy\" with a footnote citing the sources and noting that \"H\u00e4ckel has also given analogous drawings in his ''Sch\u00f6pfungsgeschichte.''\" The fifth edition of Haeckel's book appeared in 1874, with its frontispiece a heroic portrait of Haeckel himself, replacing the previous controversial image of the heads of apes and humans.<ref name=hopwood2006 />{{rp|285\u2013288}}<ref>{{harvnb|Darwin|1871|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=17 4], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&itemID=F937.1&pageseq=27 14\u201317]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Haeckel Anthropogenie 1874.jpg|thumb|right|1874 illustration from ''Anthropogenie'' showing \"very early\", \"somewhat later\" and \"still later\" stages of embryos of fish (F), salamander (A), turtle (T), chick (H), pig (S), cow (R), rabbit (K), and human (M)]]\n\n=== Controversy ===\nLater in 1874, Haeckel's simplified embryology textbook ''Anthropogenie'' made the subject into a battleground over Darwinism aligned with Bismarck's ''[[Kulturkampf]]'' (\"culture struggle\") against the Catholic Church.

By [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem|the completeness theorem of first-order logic]], a statement is universally valid if and only if it can be deduced from the axioms, so the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' can also be viewed as asking for an algorithm to decide whether a given statement is provable from the axioms using the [[rules of logic]].\n\nIn 1936, [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]] published independent papers<ref>Church's paper was presented to the American Mathematical Society on 19 April 1935 and published on 15 April 1936. Turing, who had made substantial progress in writing up his own results, was disappointed to learn of Church's proof upon its publication (see correspondence between [[Max Newman]] and Church in [http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0948&kw= Alonzo Church papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100607132453/http://diglib.princeton.edu/ead/getEad?eadid=C0948&kw= |date=7 June 2010 }}). Turing quickly completed his paper and rushed it to publication; it was received by the ''Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society'' on 28 May 1936, read on 12 November 1936, and published in series 2, volume 42 (1936\u20137); it appeared in two sections: in Part 3 (pages 230\u2013240), issued on Nov 30, 1936 and in Part 4 (pages 241\u2013265), issued on Dec 23, 1936; Turing added corrections in volume 43 (1937), pp. 544\u2013546. See the footnote at the end of Soare: 1996.</ref> showing that a general solution to the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' is impossible, assuming that the intuitive notion of \"[[effectively calculable]]\" is captured by the functions computable by a [[Turing machine]] (or equivalently, by those expressible in the [[lambda calculus]]). This assumption is now known as the [[Church\u2013Turing thesis]].\n\n== History of the problem ==\nThe origin of the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' goes back to [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who in the seventeenth century, after having constructed a successful mechanical [[calculating machine]], dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the [[truth value]]s of mathematical statements.<ref>Davis 2000: pp.&nbsp;3&ndash;20</ref>  He realized that the first step would have to be a clean [[formal language]], and much of his subsequent work was directed towards that goal.  In 1928, [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] posed the question in the form outlined above.\n\nIn continuation of his \"program\", Hilbert posed three questions at an international conference in 1928,  the third of which became known as \"Hilbert's ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}''.\"<ref>Hodges p.&nbsp;91</ref> In 1929, [[Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel]] published one paper on special cases of the decision problem that was prepared by [[Paul Bernays]].<ref name=\"Kline\">{{Citation | first=G. L. | last=Kline | title=Review of Foundations of mathematics and mathematical logic by S. A. Yanovskaya | journal=[[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume=16 | pages=46&ndash;48 | year=1951 | doi=10.2307/2268665 | jstor=2268665 | issue=1 | last2=Anovskaa | first2=S. A.}}</ref>\n\nAs late as 1930, Hilbert believed that there would be no such thing as an unsolvable problem.<ref>Hodges p.&nbsp;92, quoting from Hilbert</ref>\n\n== Negative answer ==\nBefore the question could be answered, the notion of \"algorithm\" had to be formally defined.  This was done by [[Alonzo Church]] in 1936 with the concept of \"effective calculability\" based on his [[lambda calculus|\u03bb calculus]] and by Alan Turing in the same year with his concept of [[Turing machine]]s.  Turing  immediately recognized that these are equivalent [[model of computation|models of computation]].\n\nThe negative answer to the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' was then given by Alonzo Church in 1935\u201336 and [[multiple discovery|independently]] shortly thereafter by Alan Turing in 1936.  Church proved that there is no [[computable function]] which decides for two given \u03bb-calculus expressions whether they are equivalent or not. He relied heavily on earlier work by [[Stephen Cole Kleene|Stephen Kleene]]. Turing reduced the question of the existence of a 'general method' which decides whether any given Turing Machine halts or not (the [[halting problem]]) to the question of the existence of an 'algorithm' or 'general method' able to solve the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}''. If 'Algorithm' is understood as being equivalent to a Turing Machine, and with the answer to the latter question negative (in general), the question about the existence of an Algorithm for the ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' also must be negative (in general). In his 1936 paper, Turing says: ''\"Corresponding to each computing machine 'it' we construct a  formula 'Un(it)' and we show that, if there is a general method for determining whether 'Un(it)' is provable, then there is a general method for determining whether 'it' ever prints 0\"''.\n\nThe work of both Church and Turing was heavily influenced by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]'s earlier work on his [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]], especially by the method of assigning numbers (a [[G\u00f6del numbering]]) to logical formulas in order to reduce logic to arithmetic.\n\nThe ''{{lang|de|Entscheidungsproblem}}'' is related to [[Hilbert's tenth problem]], which asks for an [[algorithm]] to decide whether [[Diophantine equation]]s have a solution.  The non-existence of such an algorithm, established by [[Yuri Matiyasevich]] in 1970, also implies a negative answer to the Entscheidungsproblem.\n\nSome first-order theories are algorithmically decidable; examples of this include [[Presburger arithmetic]], [[real closed field]]s and [[Type system#Static typing|static type systems]] of many [[programming language]]s. The general first-order theory of the [[natural number]]s expressed in [[Peano axioms|Peano's axioms]] cannot be decided with an algorithm, however.\n\n==Practical decision procedures==\nHaving practical decision procedures for classes of logical formulas is of considerable interest for [[program verification]] and circuit verification. Pure Boolean logical formulas are usually decided using [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT-solving]] techniques based on the [[DPLL algorithm]]. Conjunctive formulas over linear real or rational arithmetic can be decided using the [[simplex algorithm]], formulas in linear integer arithmetic ([[Presburger arithmetic]]) can be decided using [[Cooper's algorithm]] or [[William Pugh (computer scientist)|William Pugh]]'s [[Omega test]]. Formulas with negations, conjunctions and disjunctions combine the difficulties of satisfiability testing with that of decision of conjunctions; they are generally decided nowadays using [[satisfiability modulo theories|SMT-solving]] techniques, which combine SAT-solving with decision procedures for conjunctions and propagation techniques. Real polynomial arithmetic, also known as the theory of [[real closed field]]s, is decidable; this is [[Tarski\u2013Seidenberg theorem]], which has been implemented in computers by using the [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Automated theorem proving]]\n* [[Hilbert's second problem]]\n* [[Oracle machine]]\n* [[Turing's proof]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[David Hilbert]] and [[Wilhelm Ackermann]] (1928).

Einhard was a dedicated servant of [[Charlemagne]] and his son [[Louis the Pious]]; his main work is a biography of Charlemagne, the ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', \"one of the most precious literary bequests of the early Middle Ages.\"<ref>Hodgkin 222.</ref>\n\n==Public life==\nEinhard was from the eastern [[German language|German-speaking]] part of the [[Francia|Frankish Kingdom]]. Born into a family of  landowners of some importance, his parents sent him to be educated by the monks of [[Fulda]] - one of the most impressive centres of learning in the Frank lands. Perhaps due to his small stature, which restricted his riding and sword-fighting ability, Einhard concentrated his energies towards scholarship and especially to the mastering of [[Latin]].<ref>Smith 62</ref> He was accepted into the hugely wealthy court of Charlemagne around 791 or 792. Charlemagne actively sought to amass [[scholar]]ly men around him and established a royal school led by the [[Northumbria]]n scholar [[Alcuin]]. Einhard evidently was a talented builder and [[construction]] manager, because Charlemagne put him in charge of the completion of several [[palace]] complexes including [[Charlemagne's Palace in Aachen|Aachen]] and [[Imperial Palace Ingelheim|Ingelheim]]. Despite the fact that Einhard was on intimate terms with Charlemagne, he never achieved office in his [[reign]]. In 814, on Charlemagne's death his son [[Louis the Pious]] made Einhard his private [[secretary]]. Einhard retired from [[Noble court|court]] during the time of the disputes between Louis and his sons in the spring of 830.\n\nHe died at [[Seligenstadt]] in 840.\n\n==Private life==\nEinhard was married to Emma, of whom little is known. There is a possibility that their marriage bore a son, Vussin. Their marriage also appears to have been exceptionally liberal for the period, with Emma being as active as Einhard, if not more so, in the handling of their property.<ref>Smith 58.</ref> It is said that in the later years of their marriage Emma and Einhard abstained from sexual relations, choosing instead to focus their attentions on their many religious commitments. Though he was undoubtedly devoted to her, Einhard wrote nothing of his wife until after her death on 13 December 835, when he wrote to a friend that he was reminded of her loss in \u2018every day, in every action, in every undertaking, in all the administration of the house and household, in everything needing to be decided upon and sorted out in my religious and earthly responsibilities\u2019.<ref>From Einhard\u2019s letter of April 836 to Lupus of Ferrieres. Qtd. in Smith 55.</ref>\n[[File:Denkmal Einhard Eschweiler.jpg|thumb|Einhard memorial in the German city of [[Eschweiler]]]]\n\n==Religious beliefs==\nEinhard made numerous references to himself as a \"sinner\" according to his strong Christian faith.<ref>Smith 60-61.</ref> He erected churches at both of his estates in Michelstadt and Mulinheim. In Michelstadt, he also saw fit to build a basilica completed in 827 and then sent a servant, Ratleic, to Rome with an end to find relics for the new building. Once in Rome, Ratleic robbed a catacomb of the bones of the Martyrs [[Marcellinus and Peter]] and had them translated to Michelstadt. Once there, the relics made it known they were unhappy with their new tomb and thus had to be moved again to Mulinheim. Once established there, they proved to be miracle workers. Although unsure as to why these saints should choose such a \"sinner\" as their patron, Einhard nonetheless set about ensuring they continued to receive a resting place fitting of their honour.<ref>Smith 67.</ref>  Between 831 and 834 he founded a Benedictine Monastery and, after the death of his wife, served as its Abbot until his own death in 840.\n\n==Local lore==\nLocal lore from Seligenstadt portrays Einhard as the lover of Emma, one of [[Charlemagne]]'s daughters, and has the couple elope from court. Charlemagne found them at Seligenstadt (then called Oberm\u00fchlheim) and forgave them. This account is used to explain the name \"Seligenstadt\" by [[folk etymology]].<ref>\"Der hessische Spessart\" par. 4.</ref> Einhard and his wife were originally buried in one sarcophagus in the choir of the church in Seligenstadt, but in 1810 the sarcophagus was presented by the Grand Duke of Hesse to the count of Erbach, who claims descent from Einhard as the husband of Imma, the reputed daughter of Charlemagne. The count put it in the famous chapel of his castle at Erbach in the Odenwald.<ref>Schaff par. 164.</ref>\n\n==Works==\nThe most famous of Einhard's works is his [[biography]] of Charlemagne, the ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', \"The Life of Charlemagne\" (c. 817\u2013836), which provides much direct information about Charlemagne's life and character, written sometime between 817 and 830. In composing this he relied heavily upon the [[Royal Frankish Annals]]. Einhard's literary model was the classical work of the Roman historian [[Suetonius]], the ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Lives of the Caesars]]'', though it is important to stress that the work is very much Einhard's own, that is to say he adapts the models and sources for his own purposes. His work was written as a praise of Charlemagne, whom he regarded as a foster-father (''nutritor'') and to whom he was a debtor \"in life and death\". The work thus contains an understandable degree of bias, Einhard taking care to exculpate Charlemagne in some matters, not mention others, and to gloss over certain issues which would be of embarrassment to Charlemagne, such as the morality of his daughters; by contrast, other issues are curiously not glossed over, like his concubines.\n\nEinhard is also responsible for three other extant works: a collection of letters, ''On the Translations and the Miracles of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus'', and ''On the Adoration of the Cross''.<ref>Thorpe.</ref><ref>M\u00fcller 252.</ref> The latter dates from ca. 830 and was not rediscovered until 1885,<ref>\"Einhard ca. 770-840\" par. 3.</ref> when [[Ernst D\u00fcmmler]] identified a text in a manuscript in [[Vienna]] as the missing ''Libellus de adoranda cruce'',<ref>D\u00fcmmler.</ref> which Einhard had dedicated to his pupil [[Lupus Servatus]].<ref>Levison 271.</ref><ref>Stofferahn par. 10.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Royal Frankish Annals]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite news|url=http://www.hr-online.de/website/rubriken/freizeit/index.jsp?rubrik=7480&key=standard_document_914328&seite=1|title=Der hessische Spessart|publisher=HR Online|language=German|accessdate=25 March 2010}}\n* {{cite journal|last=D\u00fcmmler|first=Ernst|year=1885|title=Ein Nachtrag zu Einhards Werken|journal=[[Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft f\u00fcr \u00e4ltere deutsche Geschichtskunde]]|volume=11|pages=231\u201338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgQOAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA281|accessdate=25 March 2010}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/classical-medieval-criticism/einhard|title=Einhard c. 770-840|publisher=Enotes|accessdate=25 March 2010}}\n* {{cite book | last = Hodgkin | first = T. | authorlink = Thomas Hodgkin (historian) | title = Charles the Great | publisher = Macmillan | year = 1897 | location = London | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PivfxsqPousC}}\n* {{cite book|last=Levison|first=Wilhelm|author2=Wilhelm Wattenbach |author3=Rudolf Buchner |title=Deutschlands Geschichtsquellen im Mittelalter, Vorzeit und Karolinger: Heft.

Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called \"[[trivial names]]\" e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix ''-oate''. For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl [[Caprylic acid|caprylate]], has the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n[[Image:EtOAcImp.png|thumb|Ethyl acetate derived from an alcohol (blue) and an [[acyl]] group (yellow) derived from a carboxylic acid]]\n\nThe chemical formulas of organic esters usually take the form RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 are the hydrocarbon parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively. For example, [[butyl acetate]] (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from [[n-Butanol|butanol]] and [[acetic acid]] (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>. Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>.\n\nCyclic esters are called [[lactone]]s, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or an inorganic acid. One example of a (organic) lactone is [[gamma-valerolactone|\u03b3-valerolactone]].\n\n=== Orthoesters ===\nAn uncommon class of organic esters are the [[orthoester]]s, which have the formula RC(OR\u2032)<sub>3</sub>. Triethylorthoformate (HC(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from [[orthoformic acid]] (HC(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and [[ethanol]].\n\n=== Inorganic esters===\n[[Image:Phosphate Group.svg|130px|thumb|A phosphoric acid ester]]\nEsters can also be derived from an inorganic acid and an alcohol. Thus, the nomenclature extends to inorganic oxo acids and their corresponding esters: [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphate esters]]/[[organophosphate]]s, [[sulfuric acid]] and sulfate esters/[[organosulfate]]s, [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]], and [[boric acid]] and [[borate#Borate esters|borate]]s. For example, [[triphenyl phosphate]] is the ester derived from [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phenol]]. Organic carbonates are derived from [[carbonic acid]]; for example, [[ethylene carbonate]] is derived from carbonic acid and [[ethylene glycol]].\n\nSo far an alcohol and inorganic acid are linked via oxygen atoms. The definition of inorganic acid ester that feature inorganic chemical elements links between alcohols and the inorganic acid \u2013 the phosphorus atom linking to three [[alkoxy]] functional groups in [[organophosphate]] \u2013 can be extended to the same elements in various combinations of [[covalent bonds]] between carbons and the central inorganic atom and carbon\u2013oxygen bonds to central inorganic atoms. For example, phosphorus features '''three''' carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bondings and one phosphorus\u2013oxygen ''double bond'' in '''organophosphates''',\n\n[[File:Phosphate formula.svg|130px|thumb|structure of a generic organophosphate]]\n\n'''three''' carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bondings and '''no''' phosphorus\u2013oxygen '''double bonds''' in '''[[phosphite ester]]s''' or '''organophosphites''',\n\n[[Image:Phosphite.png|130px|thumb|structure of a generic phosphite ester showing the [[lone pairs]] on the P]]\n\n'''two''' carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bondings, '''no''' phosphorus\u2013oxygen '''double bonds''' but '''one''' phosphorus\u2013carbon bond in '''phosphonites''',\n\n[[File:Phosphonite.svg|130px|thumb|structure of a generic phosphonite \u2013 ester of phosphonous acid]]\n\n'''one''' carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bondings, '''no''' phosphorus\u2013oxygen '''double bonds''' but '''two''' phosphorus\u2013carbon bonds in '''phosphinites'''.\n\n[[File:Generic-phosphinite-2D.png|150px|thumb|structure of a generic phosphinite.]]\n\nIn corollary, [[Organoboron chemistry#Borinic and boronic acids and esters|boron]] features [[borinic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[boronic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and [[borate]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).\n\nAs oxygen is a [[group 16]] chemical element, sulfur atoms can replace some oxygen atoms in carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013central inorganic atom covalent bonds of an ester. As a result, '''[[thiosulfinate]]s''' and ''[[thiosulfonate]]s''', with a central inorganic sulfur atom, demonstrate clearly the assortment of [[organosulfur compounds|sulfur]] esters, that also includes '''[[organosulfate|sulfate]]s''', '''[[sulfite]]s''', '''[[sulfonate]]s''', '''[[sulfinate]]s''', '''[[sulfenate]]s''' esters.\n\n== Structure and bonding ==\nEsters contain a [[carbonyl]] center, which gives rise to 120&nbsp;\u00b0 C\u2013C\u2013O and O\u2013C\u2013O angles. Unlike [[amide]]s, esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C\u2013O\u2013C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides.<ref name=March>March, J.

The preference for the Z conformation is influenced by the nature of the substituents and solvent, if present.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Diwakar M. Pawar | author2 = Abdelnaser A.

They participate in [[hydrogen bond]]s as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than [[carboxylic acid]]s of similar molecular weight.<ref name=March/>\n\n=== Characterization and analysis ===\nEsters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]] for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730\u20131750&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> assigned to ''\u03bd''<sub>C=O</sub>. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjugation with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n== Applications and occurrence ==\nEsters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, [[fat]]s are in general triesters derived from [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.<ref>Isolation of triglyceride from nutmeg: G. D. Beal \"Trimyristen\" Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a characteristic pleasant, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the [[fragrance]] and [[flavoring|flavor]] industry. Ester bonds are also found in many [[polymer]]s.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols===\nThe classic synthesis is the [[Fischer esterification]], which involves treating a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrating]] agent:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H + R\u2032OH {{eqm}} RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe equilibrium constant for such reactions is about 5 for typical esters, e.g., ethyl acetate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Roger J. | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Alton | last3 = Andrews | first3 = Roy C. | year = 1928 | title = The Relation Between the Hydrolysis Equilibrium Constant of Esters and the Strengths of the Corresponding Acids | url = | journal = J.

[[Sulfuric acid]] is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as [[Dowex|polymeric sulfonic acids]]. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]:\n* Using the alcohol in large excess (i.e., as a solvent).\n* Using a dehydrating agent: sulfuric acid not only catalyzes the reaction but sequesters water (a reaction product). Other drying agents such as [[molecular sieves]] are also effective.\n* Removal of water by physical means such as [[distillation]] as a low-boiling [[azeotrope]]s with [[toluene]], in conjunction with a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].\n\nReagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the [[Steglich esterification]], which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in [[peptide synthesis]], where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC ([[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]]) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction. [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine]] (DMAP) is used as an acyl-transfer [[catalyst]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = B. Neises | author2 = W.

The method is useful in specialized organic synthetic operations but is considered too hazardous and expensive for large-scale applications.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with epoxides===\nCarboxylic acids are esterified by treatment with epoxides, giving \u03b2-hydroxyesters:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H  + RCHCH<sub>2</sub>O   \u2192   RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(OH)R\nThis reaction is employed in the production of [[vinyl ester resin]] resins from [[acrylic acid]].\n\n=== Alcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides ===\nAlcohols react with [[acyl chloride]]s and [[acid anhydride]]s to give esters:\n: RCOCl + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + HCl\n: (RCO)<sub>2</sub>O + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + RCO<sub>2</sub>H\n\nThe reactions are irreversible simplifying [[work-up (chemistry)|work-up]]. Since acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides also react with water, anhydrous conditions are preferred. The analogous acylations of amines to give [[amide]]s are less sensitive because amines are stronger nucleophiles and react more rapidly than does water. This method is employed only for laboratory-scale procedures, as it is expensive.\n\n===Alkylation of carboxylate salts===\nAlthough not widely employed for esterifications, salts of carboxylate anions can be alkylating agent with [[alkyl halide]]s to give esters. In the case that an [[alkyl chloride]] is used, an iodide salt can catalyze the reaction ([[Finkelstein reaction]]). The carboxylate salt is often generated ''in situ''. In difficult cases, the silver carboxylate may be used, since the silver ion coordinates to the halide aiding its departure and improving the reaction rate. This reaction can suffer from anion availability problems and, therefore, can benefit from the addition of [[phase transfer catalyst]]s or highly polar [[aprotic solvent]]s such as [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]].\n\n===Transesterification===\n[[Transesterification]], which involves changing one ester into another one, is widely practiced:\n: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + CH<sub>3</sub>OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + R\u2032OH\nLike the hydrolysation, transesterification is catalysed by acids and bases. The reaction is widely used for degrading [[triglyceride]]s, e.g. in the production of fatty acid esters and alcohols. [[Poly(ethylene terephthalate)]] is produced by the transesterification of [[dimethyl terephthalate]] and ethylene glycol:<ref name=Ullmann/> \n: (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)(CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2&nbsp;C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 {{frac|''n''}}&nbsp;{(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)}<sub>''n''</sub> + 2&nbsp;CH<sub>3</sub>OH\n\n===Carbonylation===\nAlkenes undergo \"[[hydroesterification]]\" in the presence of [[metal carbonyl]] catalysts.

The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C\u2013H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms [[adduct]]s.\n\n===Addition of nucleophiles at carbonyl <!--[[Ester hydrolysis]] redirects here-->===\nEsterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo [[hydrolysis]] under acid and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the [[Fischer esterification]]. Under basic conditions, [[hydroxide]] acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, [[saponification]], is the basis of soap making.\n:[[Image:Ester hydrolysis.png|400px|Ester saponification (basic hydrolysis)]]\n\nThe alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s to give [[amide]]s: (ammonolysis reaction)\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + NH<sub>2</sub>R\u2033 \u2192 RCONHR\u2033 + R\u2032OH\nThis reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to [[isocyanate]]s through intermediate [[hydroxamic acid]]s in the [[Lossen rearrangement]].\n\nSources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., [[Grignard reagent]]s and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.\n\n=== Reduction ===\nCompared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are [[Carbonyl reduction#Trends in carbonyl reactivity|relatively resistant to reduction]]. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to [[fatty alcohol]]s.\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RCH<sub>2</sub>OH + R\u2032OH\nA typical catalyst is [[copper chromite]]. Prior to the development of [[catalytic hydrogenation]], esters were reduced on a large scale using the [[Bouveault\u2013Blanc reduction]]. This method, which is largely obsolete, uses sodium in the presence of proton sources.\n\nEspecially for fine chemical syntheses, [[lithium aluminium hydride]] is used to reduce esters to two primary alcohols. The related reagent sodium borohydride is slow in this reaction. [[DIBAH]] reduces esters to aldehydes.<ref>{{cite web | author = W.

Deprotonation requires relatively strong bases, such as [[alkoxide]]s. Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic [[enolate]], which can further react, e.g., the [[Claisen condensation]] and its intramolecular equivalent, the [[Dieckmann condensation]]. This conversion is exploited in the [[malonic ester synthesis]], wherein the diester of [[malonic acid]] reacts with an electrophile (e.g., [[alkyl halide]]), and is subsequently decarboxylated.

Protecting a carboxylic acid is useful in peptide synthesis, to prevent self-reactions of the bifunctional [[amino acid]]s. Methyl and ethyl esters are commonly available for many amino acids; the ''t''-butyl ester tends to be more expensive. However, ''t''-butyl esters are particularly useful because, under strongly acidic conditions, the ''t''-butyl esters undergo elimination to give the carboxylic acid and [[isobutylene]], simplifying work-up.\n\n==List of ester odorants ==\nMany esters have distinctive fruit-like odors, and many occur naturally in the essential oils of plants.

often but not always [[mutualism (biology)|to mutual benefit]].\nThe term '''endosymbiosis''' is from the [[Greek language|Greek]]: \u1f14\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd ''endon'' \"within\", \u03c3\u03cd\u03bd ''syn'' \"together\" and \u03b2\u03af\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 ''biosis'' \"living\"). Examples are [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[bacteria]] (called [[rhizobia]]), which live in [[root nodule]]s on [[legume]] roots, single-cell [[algae]] inside reef-building [[coral]]s, and bacterial endosymbionts that provide essential nutrients to about 10\u201315% of insects.\n\nMany instances of endosymbiosis are obligate; that is, either the endosymbiont or the host cannot survive without the other, such as the [[Siboglinidae|gutless marine worms]] of the [[genus]] ''[[Riftia]]'', which get nutrition from their endosymbiotic bacteria. The most common examples of obligate endosymbioses are [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s. Some human parasites, e.g. ''[[Wuchereria bancrofti]]'' and ''[[Mansonella perstans]]'', thrive in their intermediate insect hosts because of an obligate endosymbiosis with ''[[Wolbachia]] spp.'' They can both be eliminated from said hosts by treatments that target this bacterium. However, not all endosymbioses are obligate and some endosymbioses can be [[symbiosis|harmful]] to either of the organisms involved.\n\nTwo major types of [[organelle]] in [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cells]], [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, originated by [[symbiogenesis]] as bacterial endosymbionts.\n\n==Bacterial endosymbionts==\n\n===In phytoplankton===\n\nIn marine environments, bacterial endosymbionts have more recently been discovered.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Villareal|first=Tracy|date=1994|title=Widespread occurrence of the Hemiaulus-cyanobacterial symbiosis in the southwest North Atlantic Ocean |journal=Bulletin of Marine Science|volume=54|pages=1-7|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal |last=Carpenter |first=Edward J.|last2=Montoya|first2=Joseph P.|last3=Burns |first3=James |last4=Mulholland |first4=Margaret R. |last5=Subramaniam|first5=Ajit|last6=Capone|first6=Douglas G.|date=1999-08-20 |title=Extensive bloom of a N2-fixing diatom/cyanobacterial association in the tropical Atlantic Ocean|url=https://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v185/p273-283/|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=185 |pages=273\u2013283 |doi=10.3354/meps185273}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=R.

Primary endosymbionts (sometimes referred to as P-endosymbionts) have been associated with their [[insect]] hosts for many millions of years (from 10 to several hundred million years in some cases). They form obligate associations (see below), and display cospeciation with their insect hosts. Secondary endosymbionts exhibit a more recently developed association, are sometimes horizontally transferred between hosts, live in the [[hemolymph]] of the insects (not specialized bacteriocytes, see below), and are not obligate.<ref>P.

As with endosymbiosis in other insects, the symbiosis is obligate in that neither the bacteria nor the insect is viable without the other. Scientists have been unable to cultivate the bacteria in lab conditions outside of the insect. With special nutritionally-enhanced diets, the insects can survive, but are unhealthy, and at best survive only a few generations.\n\nIn some insect groups, these endosymbionts live in specialized insect cells called [[bacteriocyte]]s (also called ''mycetocytes''), and are maternally-transmitted, i.e. the mother transmits her endosymbionts to her offspring. In some cases, the bacteria are transmitted in the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], as in ''Buchnera''; in others like ''Wigglesworthia'', they are transmitted via milk to the developing insect embryo. In termites, the endosymbionts reside within the hindguts and are transmitted through [[trophallaxis]] among colony members.\n\nThe primary endosymbionts are thought to help the host either by providing nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of ''Buchnera'' is to synthesize [[essential amino acid]]s that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of ''Wigglesworthia'', it is presumed, is to synthesize [[vitamin]]s that the tsetse fly does not get from the [[blood]] that it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists play a major role in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.\n\nBacteria benefit from the reduced exposure to [[predator]]s and competition from other bacterial species, the ample supply of nutrients and relative environmental stability inside the host.\n\nGenome sequencing reveals that obligate bacterial endosymbionts of insects have among the smallest of known bacterial genomes and have [[genome reduction|lost many genes]] that are commonly found in closely related bacteria. Several theories have been put forth to explain the loss of genes. It is presumed that some of these genes are not needed in the environment of the host insect cell. A complementary theory suggests that the relatively small numbers of bacteria inside each insect decrease the efficiency of natural selection in 'purging' deleterious mutations and small mutations from the population, resulting in a loss of genes over many millions of years. Research in which a parallel [[phylogeny]] of bacteria and insects was inferred supports the belief that the primary endosymbionts are transferred only vertically (i.e., from the mother), and not horizontally (i.e., by escaping the host and entering a new host).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Primer \u2013 Endosymbiosis: Lessons in Conflict Resolution |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e68 |year=2004 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020068 |pmid=15024418 |pmc=368163 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040414043954/http://www.plosbiology.org/plosonline/?request=get-document&doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.0020068 |archivedate=14 April 2004 |df=dmy}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Wernegreen JJ |title=Genome evolution in bacterial endosymbionts of insects |journal=Nat.

If instead interest is compounded daily, this becomes {{math|(1 + {{sfrac|''x''|365}})<sup>365</sup>}}.

More generally, a function with a rate of change ''proportional'' to the function itself (rather than equal to it) is expressible in terms of the exponential function. This function property leads to [[exponential growth]] or [[exponential decay]].\n\nThe exponential function extends to an [[entire function]] on the [[complex plane]]. [[Euler's formula]] relates its values at purely imaginary arguments to [[trigonometric functions]].  The exponential function also has analogues for which the argument is a [[matrix exponential|matrix]], or even an element of a [[Banach algebra]] or a [[Lie algebra]].\n\n==Derivatives and differential equations==\n[[Image:Exp tangent.svg|thumb|250px|right |The derivative of the exponential function is equal to the value of the function.

This is also a multivalued function, even when {{math|''z''}} is real. This distinction is problematic, as the multivalued functions {{math|log ''z''}} and {{math|''z''<sup>''w''</sup>}} are easily confused with their single-valued equivalents when substituting a real number for {{math|''z''}}.

In this setting, {{math|''e''<sup>0</sup> {{=}} 1}}, and {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} is invertible with inverse {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''x''</sup>}} for any {{math|''x''}} in {{math|''B''}}.  If {{math|''xy'' {{=}} ''yx''}}, then {{math|''e''<sup>''x'' + ''y''</sup> {{=}} ''e''<sup>''x''</sup>''e''<sup>''y''</sup>}}, but this identity can fail for noncommuting {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}}.\n\nSome alternative definitions lead to the same function.  For instance, {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be defined as\n:<math>\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\left(1 + \\frac{x}{n} \\right)^n .</math>\n\nOr {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}} can be defined as {{math|''f''(1)}}, where {{math|''f'': '''R'''\u2192''B''}} is the solution to the differential equation {{math|''f \u2032''(''t'') {{=}} ''xf''(''t'')}} with initial condition {{math|''f''(0) {{=}} 1}}.\n\n==Lie algebras==\nGiven a [[Lie group]] {{math|''G''}} and its associated [[Lie algebra]] <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math>, the [[exponential map (Lie theory)|exponential map]] is a map <math>\\mathfrak{g}</math> {{math|\u21a6 ''G''}} satisfying similar properties. In fact, since {{math|'''R'''}} is the Lie algebra of the Lie group of all positive real numbers under multiplication, the ordinary exponential function for real arguments is a special case of the Lie algebra situation. Similarly, since the Lie group {{math|GL(''n'','''R''')}} of invertible {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices has as Lie algebra {{math|M(''n'','''R''')}}, the space of all {{math|''n'' \u00d7 ''n''}} matrices, the exponential function for square matrices is a special case of the Lie algebra exponential map.\n\nThe identity {{math|exp(''x'' + ''y'') {{=}} exp(''x'')exp(''y'')}} can fail for Lie algebra elements {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} that do not commute; the [[Baker\u2013Campbell\u2013Hausdorff formula]] supplies the necessary correction terms.\n\n==Transcendency==\nThe function {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} is not in {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}} (i.e., is not the quotient of two polynomials with complex coefficients).\n\nFor {{math|''n''}} distinct complex numbers {{math|{''a''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}}, the set {{math|{''e''<sup>''a''<sub>1</sub>''z''</sup>, \u2026, ''e''<sup>''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''z''</sup>}}} is linearly independent over {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}}.\n\nThe function {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}} is [[transcendental function|transcendental]] over {{math|'''C'''(''z'')}}.\n\n=={{anchor|exp|expm1}}Computation==\nWhen computing (an approximation of) the exponential function, if the argument is close to 0, the result will be close to 1, and computing the difference <math>\\exp(x)-1</math> may produce a loss of accuracy. \n\nFollowing a proposal by [[William Kahan]], it may thus be useful to have a dedicated routine, often called <code>expm1</code>, for computing  {{math|''e<sup>x</sup>'' \u2212 1}} directly, bypassing computation of {{math|''e''<sup>''x''</sup>}}. For example, if the exponential is computed by using its [[Taylor series]]\n:<math>e^x=1+x+\\frac {x^2}2 + \\frac{x^3}6+\\cdots +\\frac{x^n}{n!}+\\cdots,</math>\none may use the Taylor series of <math>e^x-1:</math>\n:<math>e^x-1=x+\\frac {x^2}2 + \\frac{x^3}6+\\cdots +\\frac{x^n}{n!}+\\cdots.</math>\n\nThis was first implemented in 1979 in the [[Hewlett-Packard]] [[HP-41C]] calculator, and provided by several calculators,<ref name=\"HP48_AUR\">{{cite book | title=HP&nbsp;48G Series \u2013 Advanced User's Reference Manual (AUR) | publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]] | edition=4 | date=December 1994 | id=HP 00048-90136, 0-88698-01574-2 | orig-year=1993<!-- edition 1 (1993-07) --> | url=http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=6036 | access-date=2015-09-06}}</ref><ref name=\"HP50_AUR\">{{cite book | title=HP 50g / 49g+ / 48gII graphing calculator advanced user\u2019s reference manual (AUR) | publisher=[[Hewlett-Packard]] | edition=2 | date=2009-07-14 | orig-year=2005<!-- first published: Edition 1 (2005\u201309) --> | id=HP F2228-90010 | url=http://www.hpcalc.org/details.php?id=7141 | accessdate=2015-10-10}}[http://holyjoe.net/hp/HP_50g_AUR_v2_English_searchable.pdf Searchable PDF]</ref> [[computer algebra system]]s, and programming languages (for example [[C99]]).<ref>{{cite web | title=Computation of expm1 = exp(x)\u22121 | first=Nelson H.

18 October 1663 \u2013 21 April 1736) was a general of the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] and statesman of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and the [[Archduchy of Austria]] and one of the most successful military commanders in [[Early modern Europe|modern European history]], rising to the highest offices of state at the Imperial court in [[Vienna]].\n[[File:Eugen von Savoyen ca 1728.jpg|thumb|Prince Eugene of Savoy]]\n\nBorn in [[Paris]], Eugene grew up around the French court of King [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. Based on his poor physique and bearing, the Prince was initially prepared for a career in the church, but by the age of 19 he had determined on a military career. Following [[Affair of the Poisons|a scandal]] involving his mother [[Olympe Mancini|Olympe]], he was rejected by Louis XIV for service in the French army. Eugene moved to Austria and transferred his loyalty to the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].\n\nSpanning six decades, Eugene served three Holy Roman Emperors: [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]], and [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]]. He first saw action against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] at the [[Battle of Vienna|Siege of Vienna]] in 1683 and the subsequent [[Great Turkish War|War of the Holy League]], before serving in the [[Nine Years' War]], fighting alongside his cousin, the [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Duke of Savoy]]. However, the Prince's fame was secured with his decisive victory against the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Zenta]] in 1697, earning him Europe-wide fame. Eugene enhanced his standing during the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], where his partnership with the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]] secured victories against the French on the fields of [[Battle of Blenheim|Blenheim]] (1704), [[Battle of Oudenarde|Oudenarde]] (1708), and [[Battle of Malplaquet|Malplaquet]] (1709); he gained further success in the war as Imperial commander in northern Italy, most notably at the [[Battle of Turin]] (1706). Renewed hostilities against the Ottomans in the [[Austro-Turkish War of 1716\u201318|Austro-Turkish War]] consolidated his reputation, with victories at the battles of [[Battle of Petrovaradin|Petrovaradin]] (1716), and the [[Siege of Belgrade (1717)|decisive encounter]] at [[Belgrade]] (1717).\n\nThroughout the late 1720s, Eugene's influence and skillful diplomacy managed to secure the Emperor powerful allies in his dynastic struggles with the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon powers]], but physically and mentally fragile in his later years, Eugene enjoyed less success as commander-in-chief of the army during his final conflict, the [[War of the Polish Succession]]. Nevertheless, in Austria, Eugene's reputation remains unrivalled. Although opinions differ as to his character, there is no dispute over his great achievements: he helped to save the Habsburg Empire from French conquest; he broke the westward thrust of the Ottomans, liberating central Europe after a century and a half of Turkish occupation; and he was one of the great patrons of the arts whose building legacy can still be seen in Vienna today. Eugene died in his sleep at his home on 21 April 1736, aged 72.\n\n==Early life (1663\u201399)==\n\n=== H\u00f4tel de Soissons===\n[[File:StemmaFamiliaeEugeni (English Version).png|500px|thumb|Genealogy of Prince Eugene, showing his close relationships with the French Royal family and the family of Cardinal Mazarin.

His mother, [[Olympia Mancini]], was one of [[Cardinal Mazarin]]'s nieces whom he had brought to [[Paris]] from [[Rome]] in 1647 to further his, and, to a lesser extent, their ambitions. The Mancinis were raised at the [[Palais-Royal]] along with the young Louis XIV, with whom Olympia formed an intimate relationship. Yet to her great disappointment, her chance to become queen passed by, and in 1657, Olympia married [[Eugene Maurice, Count of Soissons|Eugene Maurice]], [[Count of Soissons]], [[Count of Dreux]] and Prince of [[Savoy]]. Together they had had five sons (Eugene being the youngest) and three daughters, but neither parent spent much time with the children: his father, a brave, unglamorous French soldier, spent much of his time away campaigning, while Olympia's passion for court intrigue meant the children received little attention from her.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 9\u201310</ref>\n\n[[File:Soisson.jpg|thumb|right|250px|H\u00f4tel de Soissons, Eugene's birthplace. Engraving by [[Israel Silvestre]] c. 1650.]]\n\nThe King remained strongly attached to Olympia, so much so that many believed them to be lovers;<ref>Somerset: ''The Affair of the Poisons: Murder, Infanticide and Satanism at the Court of Louis XIV,'' 252</ref> but her scheming eventually led to her downfall. After falling out of favour at court, Olympia turned to [[La Voisin|Catherine Deshayes]] (known as ''La Voisin''), and the arts of black magic and astrology. It was a fatal relationship. Embroiled in the ''[[Poison affair|affaire des poisons]]'', suspicions now abounded of her involvement in her husband's premature death in 1673, and even implicated her in a plot to kill the King himself. Whatever the truth, Olympia, rather than face trial, subsequently fled France for [[Brussels]] in January 1680, leaving Eugene in the care of his father's mother, [[Marie de Bourbon, Countess of Soissons|Marie de Bourbon]], and her daughter, [[Princess Louise Christine of Savoy|Hereditary Princess of Baden]], mother of Prince [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Louis of Baden]].<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 9</ref>\n\nFrom the age of ten, Eugene had been brought up for a career in the church; a personal choice of the King, basing the decision on the young Prince's poor physique and bearing. Certainly Eugene's appearance was not impressive \u2014 \"He was never good-looking \u2026\" wrote the [[Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palatinate|Duchess of Orl\u00e9ans]], \"It is true that his eyes are not ugly, but his nose ruins his face; he has two large teeth which are visible at all times.\"<ref name=henderson9>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 9</ref>\n\nIn February 1683, to the surprise of his family, Eugene declared his intention of joining the army. Now 19 years old, Eugene applied directly to Louis XIV for command of a company in French service, but the King\u2014who had shown no compassion for Olympia's children since her disgrace\u2014refused him out of hand. \"The request was modest, not so the petitioner,\" he remarked. \"No one else ever  presumed to stare me out so insolently.\"<ref>Heer: ''The Holy Roman Empire,'' 228. This was a clear infringement of taboo which Louis could not tolerate. There is speculation of other reasons. [[Fran\u00e7ois-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]], Louis' Secretary of State for War, detested Eugene's mother after she had rejected a proposed marriage between her daughter and his son.</ref> Whatever the case, Louis XIV's choice would cost him dearly twenty years later, for it would be precisely Eugene, in collaboration with the Duke of Marlborough,  who would defeat the French army at Blenheim, a decisive battle which checked French military supremacy and political power.\n\nDenied a military career in France, Eugene decided to seek service abroad. One of Eugene's brothers, Louis Julius, had entered Imperial service the previous year, but he had been immediately killed fighting the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1683. When news of his death reached Paris, Eugene decided to travel to Austria in the hope of taking over his brother's command. It was not an unnatural decision: his cousin, Louis of Baden, was already a leading general in the Imperial army, as was a more distant cousin, [[Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria]]. On the night of July 26, 1683, Eugene left Paris and headed east.<ref>Heer states Eugene's departure date was 21 July.</ref>\n\n===Great Turkish War===\n{{Main|Great Turkish War}}\n[[File:1684 Entsatz von Wien anagoria.JPG|thumb|250px|The relief of Vienna on September 12, 1683.]]\nBy May 1683, the Ottoman threat to Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I's]] capital, [[Vienna]], was very real. The [[Grand Vizier]], [[Kara Mustafa Pasha]]\u2014encouraged by [[Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly]]'s Magyar rebellion\u2014had invaded [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] with between 100,000\u2013200,000 men;<ref>Childs: ''Warfare in the Seventeenth Century,'' 133. Childs puts the number at 100,000; John Wolf, as high as 200,000.</ref> within two months approximately 90,000 were beneath Vienna's walls. With the 'Turks at the gates', the Emperor fled for the safe refuge of [[Passau]] up the [[Danube]], a more distant and secure part of his dominion.<ref>Stoye: ''The Siege of Vienna,'' 114</ref> It was at Leopold I's camp that Eugene arrived in mid-August.\n\nAlthough Eugene was not of Austrian extraction, he did have [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] antecedents. His grandfather, [[Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano|Thomas Francis]], founder of the Carignano line of the [[House of Savoy]], was the son of [[Infanta Catherine Michelle of Spain|Catherine Michelle]]\u2014a daughter of [[Philip II of Spain]]\u2014and the great-grandson of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. But of more immediate consequence to Leopold I was the fact that Eugene was the second cousin of [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|Victor Amadeus]], the Duke of Savoy, a connection that the Emperor hoped might prove useful in any future confrontation with France.<ref name=henderson12>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 12</ref> These ties, together with his ascetic manner and appearance (a positive advantage to him at the sombre court of Leopold I),<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1,'' 467</ref> ensured the refugee from the hated French king a warm welcome at Passau, and a position in Imperial service.<ref name=henderson12/> Though French was his favored language, he communicated with Leopold in Italian, as the Emperor (though he knew it perfectly) disliked French. But Eugene also had a reasonable command of German, which he understood very easily, something that helped him much in the military.<ref>''The life of Prince Eugene of Savoy'', Charles de Ligne</ref>\n\nEugene was in no doubt where his new allegiance lay\u2014\"I will devote all my strength, all my courage, and if need be, my last drop of blood, to the service of your Imperial Majesty.\"<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 13</ref> This loyalty was immediately put to the test. By September, the Imperial forces under the [[Charles V, Duke of Lorraine|Duke of Lorraine]], together with a powerful Polish army under King [[John III Sobieski]], were poised to strike the Sultan's army. On the morning of 12 September, the Christian forces drew up in line of battle on the south-eastern slopes of the [[Vienna Woods]], looking down on the massed enemy camp. The day-long [[Battle of Vienna]] resulted in the lifting of the 60-day siege, and the Sultan's forces were routed and in retreat. Serving under Baden, Eugene distinguished himself in the battle, earning commendation from Lorraine and the Emperor; he later received the nomination for the colonelcy of the Dragoon Regiment Kufstein.<ref>MacMunn: ''Prince Eugene: Twin Marshal with Marlborough,'' 32</ref>\n\n====Holy League====\n[[File:Reprise ch\u00e2teau Buda 1686.jpg|thumb|300px|Recapture of Buda castle in 1686 by [[Gyula Bencz\u00far]].]]\n\nIn March 1684, Leopold I formed the [[Great Turkish War#War of the Holy League (1683\u20131698)|Holy League]] with [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to counter the Ottoman threat. For the next two years, Eugene continued to perform with distinction on campaign and establish himself as a dedicated, professional soldier; by the end of 1685, still only 22 years old, he was made a Major-General. However, little is known of Eugene's life during these early campaigns. Contemporary observers make only passing comments of his actions, and his own surviving correspondence, largely to his cousin Victor Amadeus, are typically reticent about his own feelings and experiences.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 22</ref> Nevertheless, it is clear that Baden was impressed with Eugene's qualities\u2014\"This young man will, with time, occupy the place of those whom the world regards as great leaders of armies.\"<ref>MacMunn: ''Prince Eugene: Twin Marshal with Marlborough,'' 35</ref>\n\n[[File:Max II.

After resisting for 78 days, the city fell on 2 September, and Turkish resistance collapsed throughout the region as far away as [[Principality of Transylvania (1571\u20131711)|Transylvania]] and [[Serbia]]. Further success followed in 1687, where, commanding a cavalry brigade, Eugene made an important contribution to the victory at the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1687)|Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] on 12 August. Such was the scale of their defeat that the Ottoman army mutinied\u2014a revolt which spread to [[Constantinople]]. The Grand Vizier, [[Suluieman Pasha]], was executed and Sultan [[Mehmed IV]], deposed.<ref>Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century'', pp. 287\u201389</ref> Once again, Eugene's courage earned him recognition from his superiors, who granted him the honour of personally conveying the news of victory to the Emperor in Vienna.<ref>MacMunn: ''Prince Eugene: Twin Marshal with Marlborough'', p. 39. Leopold responded with a gift of a portrait of himself set in a diamond encrusted frame</ref> For his services, Eugene was promoted to Lieutenant-General in November 1687. He was also gaining wider recognition. King [[Charles II of Spain]] bestowed upon him the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]], while his cousin, Victor Amadeus, provided him with money and two profitable abbeys in [[Piedmont]].<ref name=mckay27>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 27</ref> However, Eugene's military career suffered a temporary setback in 1688 when, on 6 September, the Prince suffered a severe wound to his knee by a musket ball during the [[Siege of Belgrade (1688)|Siege of Belgrade]]. It was not until January 1689 that he could return to active service.<ref name=mckay27/>\n\n====Interlude in the west: Nine Years' War====\n{{Main|Nine Years' War}}\nJust as [[Belgrade]] was falling to Imperial forces under Max Emmanuel in the east, French troops in the west were crossing the [[Rhine]] into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Louis XIV had hoped that a show of force would lead to a quick resolution to his dynastic and territorial disputes with the princes of the Empire along his eastern border, but his intimidatory moves only strengthened German resolve, and in May 1689, Leopold I and the Dutch signed an offensive compact aimed at repelling French aggression.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714'', pp. 192\u2013193</ref>\n\nThe [[Nine Years' War]] was professionally and personally frustrating for the Prince. Initially fighting on the Rhine with Max Emmanuel\u2014receiving a slight head wound at the Siege of Mainz in 1689\u2014Eugene subsequently transferred himself to Piedmont after Victor Amadeus joined the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Alliance]] against France in 1690. Promoted to general of cavalry, he arrived in [[Turin]] with his friend the [[Charles, Prince of Commercy|Prince of Commercy]]; but it proved an inauspicious start. Against Eugene's advice, Amadeus insisted on engaging the French [[Battle of Staffarda|at Staffarda]] and suffered a serious defeat\u2014only Eugene's handling of the Savoyard cavalry in retreat saved his cousin from disaster.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 33</ref> Eugene remained unimpressed with the men and their commanders throughout the war in Italy. \"The enemy would long ago have been beaten,\" he wrote to Vienna, \"if everyone had done their duty.\"<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 32</ref> So contemptuous was he of the Imperial commander, [[Count Antonio Caraffa|Count Caraffa]], he threatened to leave Imperial service.<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 33</ref>\n\nIn Vienna, Eugene's attitude was dismissed as the arrogance of a young upstart, but so impressed was the Emperor by his passion for the Imperial cause, he promoted him to Field-Marshal in 1693.<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 34. His promotion, however, had as much to do with the lack of good Imperial commanders as much as Eugene's proven ability thus far. There were more than 20 other Field-Marshals in Imperial service at that time.</ref> When Caraffa's replacement, [[Aeneas de Caprara|Count Caprara]], was himself transferred in 1694, it seemed that Eugene's chance for command and decisive action had finally arrived. But Amadeus, doubtful of victory and now more fearful of Habsburg influence in Italy than he was of French, had begun secret dealings with Louis XIV aimed at extricating himself from the war. By 1696, the deal was done, and Amadeus transferred his troops and his loyalty to the enemy. Eugene was never to fully trust his cousin again; although he continued to pay due reverence to the Duke as head of his family, their relationship would forever after remain strained.<ref name=mckay37>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 37</ref>\n\nMilitary honours in Italy undoubtedly belonged to the French commander [[Nicolas Catinat|Marshal Catinat]], but Eugene, the one Allied general determined on action and decisive results, did well to emerge from the Nine Years' War with an enhanced reputation.<ref name=mckay37/> With the signing of the [[Treaty of Ryswick]] in September/October 1697, the desultory war in the west was finally brought to an inconclusive end, and Leopold I could once again devote all his martial energies into defeating the Ottoman Turks in the east.\n\n====Zenta====\n[[File:Battle of Zenta.png|thumb|250px|''Battle of Zenta'' by [[Jacques Parrocel]].]]\n\nThe distractions of the war against Louis XIV had enabled the Turks to [[Siege of Belgrade (1690)|recapture Belgrade in 1690]]. In August 1691, the Austrians, under Louis of Baden, regained the advantage by heavily defeating the Turks at the [[Battle of Slankamen]] on the Danube, securing Habsburg possession of Hungary and Transylvania.<ref>Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 390</ref> However, when Baden was transferred west to fight the French in 1692, his successors, first Caprara, then from 1696, [[Augustus II the Strong|Frederick Augustus]], the Elector of Saxony, proved incapable of delivering the final blow. On the advice of the President of the [[Imperial War Council]], [[Ernst R\u00fcdiger von Starhemberg|R\u00fcdiger Starhemberg]], Eugene was offered supreme command of Imperial forces in April 1697.<ref>Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria,'' 165. Augustus II left for [[Krak\u00f3w]] to contest the election for the Polish throne, vacant since the death of John III Sobieski the previous year.</ref> This was Eugene's first truly independent command\u2014no longer need he suffer under the excessively cautious generalship of Caprara and Caraffa, or be thwarted by the deviations of Victor Amadeus. But on joining his army, he found it in a state of 'indescribable misery'.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 43</ref> Confident and self-assured, the Prince of Savoy (ably assisted by Commercy and [[Guido Starhemberg]]) set about restoring order and discipline.<ref>Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria'', p. 166</ref>\n\n[[File:Portrait of Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663-1736).png|thumb|left|170px|''Portrait of Prince Eugene of Savoy (1663\u20131736)'' c. 1700. Flemish School.]]\n\nLeopold I had warned Eugene to act cautiously, but when the Imperial commander learnt of Sultan [[Mustafa II]]'s march on Transylvania, Eugene abandoned all ideas of a defensive campaign and moved to intercept the Turks as they crossed the River [[Tisza]] at [[Battle of Zenta|Zenta]] on 11 September 1697. It was late in the day before the Imperial army struck. The Turkish cavalry had already crossed the river so Eugene decided to attack immediately, arranging his men in a half-moon formation.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', II, pp. 455\u2013456</ref> The vigour of the assault wrought terror and confusion amongst the Turks, and by nightfall, the battle was won. For the loss of some 2,000 dead and wounded, Eugene had inflicted approximately 25,000 casualties on his enemy\u2014including the Grand Vizier, [[Elmas Mehmed Pasha]]\u2014annihilating the Turkish army.<ref>Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century,'' 401\u201302. Eugene lost 401 men and 28 officers killed, and 133 officers and 1,435 men were wounded.</ref> Although the Ottomans lacked western organisation and training, the Savoyard prince had revealed his tactical skill, his capacity for bold decision, and his ability to inspire his men to excel in battle against a dangerous foe.<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 43</ref>\n\nAfter a brief terror-raid into Ottoman-held Bosnia, culminating in the sack of [[Sarajevo]], Eugene returned to Vienna in November to a triumphal reception.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p.  46</ref> His victory at Zenta had turned him into a European hero, and with victory came reward. Land in Hungary, given him by the Emperor, yielded a good income, enabling the Prince to cultivate his newly acquired tastes in art and architecture (see below); but for all his new-found wealth and property, he was, nevertheless, without personal ties or family commitments. Of his four brothers, only one was still alive at this time. His fourth brother, Emmanuel, had died aged 14 in 1676; his third, Louis Julius (already mentioned) had died on active service in 1683, and his second brother, Philippe, died of smallpox in 1693. Eugene's remaining brother, [[Louis Thomas, Count of Soissons|Louis Thomas]]\u2014ostracised for incurring the displeasure of Louis XIV\u2014travelled Europe in search of a career, before arriving in Vienna in 1699. With Eugene's help, Louis found employment in the Imperial army, only to be killed in action against the French in 1702. Of Eugene's sisters, the youngest had died in childhood. The other two, Marie Jeanne-Baptiste and Louise Philiberte, led dissolute lives. Expelled from France, Marie joined her mother in Brussels, before eloping with a renegade priest to [[Geneva]], living with him unhappily until her premature death in 1705. Of Louise, little is known after her early salacious life in Paris, but in due course, she lived for a time in a convent in Savoy before her death in 1726.<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,''  50\u201351</ref>\n\nThe Battle of Zenta proved to be the decisive victory in the long war against the Turks. With  Leopold I's interests now focused on Spain and the imminent death of Charles II, the Emperor terminated the conflict with the Sultan, and signed the [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] on 26 January 1699.<ref>Coxe.

On his deathbed Charles II had bequeathed the entire Spanish inheritance to Louis XIV's grandson, [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duke of Anjou]]. This threatened to unite the Spanish and French kingdoms under the [[House of Bourbon]]\u2014something unacceptable to England, the Dutch Republic, and Leopold I, who had himself a claim to the Spanish throne.<ref>Wolf: ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685\u20131715'', p. 59</ref> From the beginning, the Emperor had refused to accept the will of Charles II, and he did not wait for England and the Dutch Republic to begin hostilities. Before a new Grand Alliance could be concluded Leopold I prepared to send an expedition to seize the Spanish lands in Italy.\n\n[[File:Eugen von Savoyen Alpen Covens Mortiers 1702.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Prince Eugene crossing the Alps, 1701. Coloured copperplate engraving.]]\n\nEugene crossed the [[Alps]] with some 30,000 men in May/June 1701. After a series of brilliant manoeuvres the Imperial commander defeated Catinat at the [[Battle of Carpi]] on 9 July. \"I have warned you that you are dealing with an enterprising young prince,\" wrote Louis XIV to his commander, \"he does not tie himself down to the rules of war.\"<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 60</ref> On 1 September Eugene defeated Catinat's successor, [[Fran\u00e7ois de Neufville, duc de Villeroi|Marshal Villeroi]], at the [[Battle of Chiari]], in a clash as destructive as any in the Italian theatre.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', II, p. 483</ref> But as so often throughout his career the Prince faced war on two fronts\u2014the enemy in the field and the government in Vienna.<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 67</ref> Starved of supplies, money and men, Eugene was forced into unconventional means against the vastly superior enemy. During a daring [[Battle of Cremona|raid on Cremona]] on the night of 31 January/1 February 1702 Eugene captured the French commander-in-chief. Yet the coup was less successful than hoped: Cremona remained in French hands, and the [[Louis Joseph, Duke of Vend\u00f4me|Duke of Vend\u00f4me]], whose talents far exceeded Villeroi's, became the theatre's new commander. Villeroi's capture caused a sensation in Europe, and had a galvanising effect on English public opinion. \"The surprise at Cremona,\" wrote the diarist [[John Evelyn]], \"\u2026 was the greate discourse of this weeke\"; but appeals for succour from Vienna remained unheeded, forcing Eugene to seek battle and gain a 'lucky hitt'.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 64</ref> The resulting [[Battle of Luzzara]] on 15 August proved inconclusive. Although Eugene's forces inflicted double the number of casualties on the French the battle settled little except to deter Vend\u00f4me trying an all-out assault on Imperial forces that year, enabling Eugene to hold on south of the Alps.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 276</ref> With his army rotting away, and personally grieving for his long standing friend Prince Commercy who had died at Luzzara, Eugene returned to Vienna in January 1703.<ref>Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria'', p. 188</ref>\n\n====President of the Imperial War Council====\nEugene's European reputation was growing (Cremona and Luzzara had been celebrated as victories throughout the Allied capitals), yet because of the condition and morale of his troops the 1702 campaign had not been a success.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 66. Eugene was in no doubt the blame lay with Leopold and his ministry, namely Henry Mansfeld and Gotthard Salaburg.</ref> Austria itself was now facing the direct threat of invasion from across the border in [[Bavaria]] where the state's Elector, Maximilian Emanuel, had declared for the Bourbons in August the previous year. Meanwhile, in Hungary a small-scale revolt had broken out in May and was fast gaining momentum. With the monarchy at the point of complete financial breakdown Leopold I was at last persuaded to change the government. At the end of June 1703 [[Gundaker Starhemberg]] replaced Gotthard Salaburg as President of the Treasury, and Prince Eugene succeeded Henry Mansfeld as the new President of the Imperial [[War Council (Austria)|War Council]] (''Hofkriegsratspr\u00e4sident'').<ref>Spielman: ''Leopold I of Austria'', p. 189</ref>\n\nAs head of the war council Eugene was now part of the Emperor's inner circle, and the first president since [[Raimondo Montecuccoli|Montecuccoli]] to remain an active commander. Immediate steps were taken to improve efficiency within the army: encouragement and, where possible, money, was sent to the commanders in the field; promotion and honours were distributed according to service rather than influence; and discipline improved. But the Austrian monarchy faced severe peril on several fronts in 1703: by June the [[Claude Louis Hector de Villars|Duke of Villars]] had reinforced the Elector of Bavaria on the Danube thus posing a direct threat to Vienna, while Vend\u00f4me remained at the head of a large army in northern Italy opposing Guido Starhemberg's weak Imperial force. Of equal alarm was [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]]'s revolt which, by the end of the year, had reached as far as [[Moravia]] and [[Lower Austria]].<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 73</ref>\n\n====Blenheim====\n[[File:The Duke of Marlborough greeting Prince Eugene of Savoy after their victory at Blenheim.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Duke of Marlborough greeting Prince Eugene of Savoy'' [[Riding animal|mounted]] ''after their victory at Blenheim'' by [[Robert Alexander Hillingford]].]]\n\nDissension between Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had prevented an assault on Vienna in 1703, but in the Courts of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] and [[Madrid]], ministers confidently anticipated the city's fall.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' p. 124</ref> The Imperial ambassador in London, [[John Wenceslau Wratislaw von Mitrowitz|Count Wratislaw]], had pressed for Anglo-Dutch assistance on the Danube as early as February 1703, but the crisis in southern Europe seemed remote from the [[Court of St. James's]] where colonial and commercial considerations were more to the fore of men's minds.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' p. 125</ref> Only a handful of statesmen in England or the Dutch Republic realised the true implications of Austria's peril; foremost amongst these was the English Captain-General, the [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]].<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'' p. 126</ref>\n\nBy early 1704 Marlborough had resolved to march south and rescue the situation in southern Germany and on the Danube, personally requesting the presence of Eugene on campaign so as to have \"a supporter of his zeal and experience\".<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1''  vol II, p. 731</ref> The Allied commanders met for the first time at the small village of [[Mundelsheim]] on 10 June, and immediately formed a close rapport\u2014the two men becoming, in the words of [[Thomas Lediard]], 'Twin constellations in glory'.<ref>Lediard: ''The Life of John, Duke of Marlborough'', I, p. 199</ref> This professional and personal bond ensured mutual support on the battlefield, enabling many successes during the Spanish Succession war. The first of these victories, and the most celebrated, came on 13 August 1704 at the [[Battle of Blenheim]]. Eugene commanded the right wing of the Allied army, holding the Elector of Bavaria's and [[Ferdinand de Marsin|Marshal Marsin]]'s superior forces, while Marlborough broke through the [[Camille d'Hostun, duc de Tallard|Marshal Tallard]]'s center, inflicting over 30,000 casualties. The battle proved decisive: Vienna was saved and Bavaria was knocked out of the war. Both Allied commanders were full of praise for each other's performance. Eugene's holding operation, and his pressure for action leading up to the battle, proved crucial for the Allied success.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'' p. 87</ref>\n\nIn Europe Blenheim is regarded as much a victory for Eugene as it is for Marlborough, a sentiment echoed by Sir [[Winston Churchill]] (Marlborough's descendant and biographer), who pays tribute to \"the glory of Prince Eugene, whose fire and spirit had exhorted the wonderful exertions of his troops.\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1'' vol II, p. 865</ref> France now faced the real danger of invasion, but Leopold I in Vienna was still under severe strain: R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's revolt was a major threat; and Guido Starhemberg and Victor Amadeus (who had once again switched loyalties and rejoined the Grand Alliance in 1703) had been unable to halt the French under Vend\u00f4me in northern Italy. Only Amadeus' capital, [[Turin]], held on.\n\n====Turin and Toulon====\nEugene returned to Italy in April 1705, but his attempts to move west towards Turin were thwarted by Vend\u00f4me's skilful manoeuvres. Lacking boats and bridging materials, and with desertion and sickness rife within his army, the outnumbered Imperial commander was helpless. Leopold I's assurances of money and men had proved illusory, but desperate appeals from Amadeus and criticism from Vienna goaded the Prince into action, resulting in the Imperialists' bloody defeat at the [[Battle of Cassano (1705)|Battle of Cassano]] on 16 August.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', III, p. 15</ref>  However, following Leopold I's death and the accession of [[Joseph I, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph I]] to the Imperial throne in May 1705, Eugene at last began to receive the personal backing he desired. Joseph I proved to be a strong supporter of Eugene's supremacy in military affairs; he was the most effective emperor the Prince served and the one he was happiest under.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 94</ref> Promising support, Joseph I persuaded Eugene to return to Italy and restore Habsburg honour.\n\n[[File:Prince Eugene's Italian campaign, 1701 - 1707.png|thumb|300px|Eugene's major engagements in the Italian theatre during the War of the Spanish Succession.]]\n\nThe Imperial commander arrived in theatre in mid-April 1706, just in time to organise an orderly retreat of what was left of  [[Christian Detlev Reventlow|Count Reventlow]]'s inferior army following his defeat by Vend\u00f4me at the [[Battle of Calcinato]] on 19 April. Vend\u00f4me now prepared to defend the lines along the river [[Adige]], determined to keep Eugene cooped to the east while the [[Louis d'Aubusson de la Feuillade|Marquis of La Feuillade]] threatened Turin. However, feigning attacks along the Adige, Eugene descended south across the river [[Po River|Po]] in mid-July, outmanoeuvring the French commander and gaining a favourable position from which he could at last move west towards Piedmont and relieve Savoy's capital.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', III, 17</ref>\n\n[[File:Prince Eugene of Savoy.png|170px|thumb|left|Prince Eugene by Jacob van Schuppen.]]\n\nEvents elsewhere were now to have major consequences for the war in Italy. With Villeroi's crushing defeat by Marlborough at the [[Battle of Ramillies]] on 23 May, Louis XIV recalled Vend\u00f4me north to take command of French forces in Flanders. It was a transfer that [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] considered something of a deliverance for the French commander who was \"now beginning to feel the unlikelihood of success [in Italy] \u2026 for Prince Eugene, with the reinforcements<ref>The Duke of Marlborough had supplied Eugene with 10,000 reinforcements, as well as a loan of \u00a3250,000.</ref> that had joined him after the Battle of Calcinato, had entirely changed the outlook in that theatre of the war.\"<ref>Saint-Simon. ''Memoirs'', 303</ref> The [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], under the direction of Marsin, replaced Vend\u00f4me, but indecision and disorder in the French camp led to their undoing. After uniting his forces with Victor Amadeus at [[Villastellone]] in early September, Eugene attacked, overwhelmed, and decisively defeated the French forces [[Battle of Turin|besieging Turin]] on 7 September. Eugene's success broke the French hold on northern Italy, and the whole Po valley fell under Allied control. Eugene had gained a victory as signal as his colleague had at Ramillies\u2014\"It is impossible for me to express the joy it has given me;\" wrote Marlborough, \"for I not only esteem but I really love the prince. This glorious action must bring France so low, that if our friends could but be persuaded to carry on the war with vigour one year longer, we cannot fail, with the blessing of God, to have such a peace as will give us quiet for all our days.\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 2'', III, p. 182. Eugene took little interest in Milan: he never returned after 1707.</ref>\n\nThe Imperial victory in Italy marked the beginning of Austrian rule in Lombardy, and earned Eugene the Governorship of [[Duchy of Milan|Milan]]. But the following year was to prove a disappointment for the Prince and the Grand Alliance as a whole. The Emperor and Eugene (whose main goal after Turin was to take [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] from Philip duc d'Anjou's supporters), reluctantly agreed to Marlborough's plan for an [[Battle of Toulon (1707)|attack on Toulon]]\u2014the seat of French naval power in the Mediterranean. However, disunion between the Allied commanders\u2014Victor Amadeus, Eugene, and the English Admiral [[Cloudesley Shovell|Shovell]]\u2014doomed the Toulon enterprise to failure. Although Eugene favoured some sort of attack on France's south-eastern border it was clear he felt the expedition impractical, and had shown none of the \"alacrity which he had displayed on other occasions.\"<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', III, p. 28</ref> Substantial French reinforcements finally brought an end to the venture, and on 22 August 1707 the Imperial army began its retirement. The subsequent capture of [[Susa (Italy)|Susa]] could not compensate for the total collapse of the Toulon expedition and with it any hope of an Allied war-winning blow that year.<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 199</ref>\n\n====Oudenarde and Malplaquet====\n[[File:Eugene at Oudenarde (detail).png|thumb|300px|Prince Eugene at Oudenarde (detail) by [[Huchtenburg|Jan van Huchtenburg]], who was employed round 1709 to depict ten battle scenes.]]\n\nAt the beginning of 1708 Eugene successfully evaded calls for him to take charge in Spain (in the end Guido Starhemberg was sent), thus enabling him to take command of the Imperial army on the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] and once again unite with Marlborough in the Spanish Netherlands.<ref>Eugene's army was made up almost entirely of Germans paid for by Britain and the Dutch Republic.</ref> Eugene (without his army) arrived at the Allied camp at Assche, west of Brussels, in early July, providing a welcome boost to morale after the early defection of [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]] to the French. \" \u2026 our affairs improved through God's support and Eugene's aid,\" wrote the Prussian General [[Dubislav Gneomar von Natzmer|Natzmer]], \"whose timely arrival raised the spirits of the army again and consoled us.\"<ref>Churchill: ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 2'', III, p. 350. It was also at this time that Eugene visited his mortally ill mother in Brussels for the last time. She died later that year in 1708.</ref> Heartened by the Prince's confidence the Allied commanders devised a bold plan to engage the French army under Vend\u00f4me and the [[Louis, Duke of Burgundy (1682\u20131712)|Duke of Burgundy]]. On 10 July the Anglo-Dutch army made a forced march to surprise the French, reaching the river [[Scheldt]] just as the enemy were crossing to the north. The [[Battle of Oudenarde|ensuing battle]] on 11 July\u2014more a contact action rather than a set-piece engagement\u2014ended in a resounding success for the Allies, aided by the dissension of the two French commanders.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714,'' 319</ref> While Marlborough remained in overall command, Eugene had led the crucial right flank and centre. Once again the Allied commanders had co-operated remarkably well. \"Prince Eugene and I,\" wrote the Duke, \"shall never differ about our share of the laurels.\"<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 162</ref>\n\n[[File:John Churchill Marlborough portr\u00e4tterad av Adriaen van der Werff (1659-1722).jpg|thumb|left|170px|Duke of Marlborough (1650\u20131722) by [[Adriaen van der Werff]].

But fearful of unprotected supply-lines, the Dutch and Eugene favoured a more cautious approach. Marlborough acquiesced and resolved upon the siege of [[Vauban]]'s great fortress, [[Siege of Lille (1708)|Lille]].<ref name=chandler224>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 224</ref> While the Duke commanded the covering force, Eugene oversaw the siege of the town which surrendered on 22 October; however, it was not until 10 December that the resolute [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois, duc de Boufflers|Marshal Boufflers]] yielded the [[citadel]]. Yet for all the difficulties of the siege (Eugene was badly wounded above his left eye by a musket ball, and even survived an attempt to poison him), the campaign of 1708 had been a remarkable success. The French were driven out of almost all the Spanish Netherlands. \"He who has not seen this,\" wrote Eugene, \"has seen nothing.\"<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 117: When King Louis XIV heard about Eugene's wound, he remarked, \"I certainly don't want Prince Eugene to die but I should not be sorry if his wound stopped him taking any further part in the campaign.\"</ref>\n\nThe recent defeats, together with the severe winter of 1708\u201309, had caused extreme famine and privation in France. Louis XIV was close to accepting Allied terms, but the conditions demanded by the leading Allied negotiators, [[Anthonie Heinsius]], [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]], Marlborough, and Eugene\u2014principally that Louis XIV should use his own troops to force Philip V off the Spanish throne\u2014proved unacceptable to the French. Neither Eugene nor Marlborough had objected to the Allied demands at the time, but neither wanted the war with France to continue, and would have preferred further talks to deal with the Spanish issue. But the French King offered no further proposals.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 121</ref> Lamenting the collapse of the negotiations, and aware of the vagaries of war, Eugene wrote to the Emperor in mid-June 1709. \"There can be no doubt that the next battle will be the biggest and bloodiest that has yet been fought.\"<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 171</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of [[Tournai]] on 3 September (itself a major undertaking),<ref>Chandler: ''Marlborough as Military Commander'', p. 249. Coxe says the citadel fell on 4 September. Chandler describes the siege as one of the hardest fought and least pleasant of modern history. This time, Marlborough conducted the siege while Eugene commanded the covering force.</ref> the Allied generals turned their attention towards [[Mons]]. Marshal Villars, recently joined by Boufflers, moved his army south-west of the town and began to fortify his position. Marlborough and Eugene favoured an engagement before Villars could render his position impregnable; but they also agreed to wait for reinforcements from Tournai which did not arrive until the following night, thus giving the French further opportunity to prepare their defences. Notwithstanding the difficulties of the attack, however, the Allied generals did not shrink from their original determination.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', III, p. 58</ref> The subsequent [[Battle of Malplaquet]], fought on 11 September 1709, was the bloodiest engagement of the war. On the left flank, the [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange|Prince of Orange]] led his Dutch infantry in desperate charges only to have it cut to pieces; on the other flank, Eugene attacked and suffered almost as severely. But sustained pressure on his extremities forced Villars to weaken his centre, thus enabling Marlborough to breakthrough and claim victory. Villars was unable to save Mons, which subsequently capitulated on 21 October, but his resolute defence at Malplaquet\u2014inflicting up to 25% casualties on the Allies\u2014may have saved France from destruction.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714'', p. 335</ref>\n\n====Final campaigning: Eugene alone====\n[[File:Low Countries 1700.png|thumb|300px|Following his victory in northern Italy, Eugene fought primarily in the Low Countries during the War of the Spanish Succession.]]\n\nIn August 1709 Eugene's chief political opponent and critic in Vienna, Prince [[Charles Theodore von Salm|Salm]], retired as court chamberlain. Eugene and Wratislaw were now the undisputed leaders of the Austrian government: all major departments of state were in their hands or those of their political allies.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 128</ref> However, another attempt at a negotiated settlement at [[Geertruidenberg]] in April 1710 failed, largely because the English [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]] still felt strong enough to refuse concessions, while Louis XIV saw little reason to accept what he had refused the previous year. Eugene and Marlborough could not be accused of wrecking the negotiations, but neither showed regret at the breakdown of the talks. There was no alternative but to continue the war, and in June the Allied commanders captured [[Douai]]. This success was followed by a series of minor sieges, and by the close of 1710 the Allies had cleared much of France's protective ring of fortresses. Yet there had been no final, decisive breakthrough, and this was to be the last year that Eugene and Marlborough would work together.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 130\u2013131</ref>\n\n[[File:Godfrey Kneller Eugen von Savoyen 1712.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Portrait of Eugene from the school of Godfrey Kneller, 1712.]]\n\nFollowing the death of  Joseph I on 17 April 1711 his brother, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]], the pretender to the Spanish throne, became emperor. In England the new [[Tory (British political party)|Tory]] government (the 'peace party' who had deposed the Whigs in October 1710) declared their unwillingness to see Charles VI become Emperor as well as King of Spain, and had already begun secret negotiations with the French. In January 1712 Eugene arrived in England hoping to divert the government away from its peace policy, but despite the social success the visit  was a political failure: [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and her ministers remained determined to end the war regardless of the Allies. Eugene had also arrived too late to save Marlborough who, seen by the Tories as the main obstacle to peace, had already been dismissed on charges of embezzlement. Elsewhere, however, the Austrians had made some progress\u2014the Hungarian revolt had finally came to end. Although Eugene would have preferred to crush the rebels the Emperor had offered lenient conditions, leading to the signing of the [[Treaty of Szatm\u00e1r]] on 30 April 1711.<ref>Lynn gives the signing date as 1 May</ref>\n\nHoping to influence public opinion in England and force the French into making substantial concessions, Eugene prepared for a major campaign. However, on 21 May 1712\u2014when the Tories felt they had secured favourable terms with their unilateral talks with the French\u2014the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|Duke of Ormonde]] (Marlborough's successor) received the so-called 'restraining orders', forbidding him to take part in any military action.<ref>Wolf: ''The Emergence of the Great Powers: 1685\u20131715'', p. 89. Although the Tory ministers did not inform Eugene of the restraining orders, they did inform Marshal Villars. In October 1712 the Tory government even communicated to the French what they knew of Eugene's war plans.</ref> Eugene took the fortress of [[Le Quesnoy]] in early July, before besieging [[Landrecies]], but Villars, taking advantage of Allied disunity, outmanoeuvred Eugene and defeated the [[Arnold van Keppel, 1st Earl of Albemarle|Earl of Albermarle]]'s Dutch garrison at [[Battle of Denain|Denain]] on 24 July. The French followed the victory by seizing the Allies' main supply magazine at [[Marchiennes]], before reversing their earlier losses at [[Douai]], Le Quesnoy and [[Bouchain]]. In one summer the whole forward Allied position laboriously built up over the years to act as the springboard into France had been precipitously abandoned.<ref>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714'', p. 352\u2013354</ref>\n\nWith the death in December of his friend and close political ally, Count Wratislaw, Eugene became undisputed 'first minister' in Vienna. His position was built on his military successes, but his actual power was expressed through his role as president of the war council, and as ''de facto'' president of the conference which dealt with foreign policy.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 154</ref> In this position of influence Eugene took the lead in pressing Charles VI towards peace. The government had come to accept that further war in the Netherlands or Spain was impossible without the aid of the Maritime Powers; yet the Emperor, still hoping that somehow he could place himself on the throne in Spain, refused to make peace at the [[Treaty of Utrecht|Utrecht conference]] along with the other Allies. Reluctantly, Eugene prepared for another campaign, but lacking troops, finance, and supplies his prospects in 1713 were poor. Villars, with superior numbers, was able to keep Eugene guessing as to his true intent. Through successful feints and stratagems [[Landau]] fell to the French commander in August, followed in November by [[Freiburg]].<ref name=lynn357>Lynn: ''The Wars of Louis XIV, 1667\u20131714'', p. 357</ref> Eugene was reluctant to carry on the war, and wrote to the Emperor in June that a bad peace would be better than being 'ruined equally by friend and foe'.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 145</ref> With Austrian finances exhausted and the German states reluctant to continue the war, Charles VI was compelled to enter into negotiations. Eugene and Villars (who had been old friends since the Turkish campaigns of the 1680s) initiated talks on 26 November. Eugene proved an astute and determined negotiator, and gained favourable terms by the [[Treaty of Rastatt]] signed on 7 March 1714 and the [[Treaty of Baden (1714)|Treaty of Baden]] signed on 7 September 1714.<ref>For a detailed description of Prince Eugene's role in the peace conference and treaty of Baden see ''Das Diarium des Badener Friedens 1714 von Caspar Joseph Dorer.

Turkish military ambitions had revived after 1711 when they had mauled [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]'s army on the river [[Prut]]h: in December 1714 Sultan [[Ahmed III]]'s forces attacked the Venetians in the [[Morea]].<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', III, p. 100</ref> To Vienna it was clear that the Turks intended to attack Hungary and undo the whole Karlowitz settlement of 1699. After the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] rejected an offer of mediation in April 1716, Charles VI despatched Eugene to Hungary to lead his relatively small but professional army. Of all Eugene's wars this was the one in which he exercised most direct control; it was also a war which, for the most part, Austria fought and won on her own.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', pp. 159\u2013160</ref>\n \nEugene left Vienna in early June 1716 with a field army of between 80,000\u201390,000 men. By early August 1716 the Ottoman Turks, some 200,000 men under the sultan's son-in-law, the Grand Vizier [[Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha|Damat Ali Pasha]], were marching from Belgrade towards Eugene's position west of the fortress of [[Petrovaradin]] on the north bank of the Danube.<ref name=setton435>Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 435</ref> The Grand Vizier had intended to seize the fortress; but Eugene gave him no chance to do so. After resisting calls for caution and forgoing a council of war, the Prince decided to [[Battle of Petrovaradin|attack immediately]] on the morning of 5 August with approximately 70,000 men.<ref>Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century'', p. 435; McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 161</ref> The Turkish [[Janissary|janissaries]] had some initial success, but after an Imperial cavalry attack on their flank, Ali Pasha's forces fell into confusion. Although the Imperials lost almost 5,000 dead or wounded, the Turks, who retreated in disorder to Belgrade, seem to have lost double that amount, including the Grand Vizier himself who had entered the m\u00eal\u00e9e and subsequently died of his wounds.<ref name=setton435/>\n\n[[File:Eugene of Savoy during the Battle of Belgrade 1717.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Eugene at the Battle of Belgrade 1717. Artist: [[Johann Gottfried Auerbach]]. The battle was Eugene's last great victory.]]\n\nEugene proceeded to take the [[Banat]] fortress of [[Timi\u0219oara]] (Temeswar in German) in mid-October 1716 (thus ending 164 years of Turkish rule), before turning his attention to the next campaign and to what he considered the main goal of the war, Belgrade. Situated at the confluence of the Rivers Danube and [[Sava]], Belgrade held a garrison of 30,000 men under Mustapha Pasha.<ref>Setton: ''Venice, Austria, and the Turks in the Seventeenth Century'', pp. 438\u2013439</ref> Imperial troops besieged the place in mid-June 1717, and by the end of July large parts of the city had been destroyed by artillery fire. By the first days of August, however, a huge Turkish field army (150,000\u2013200,000 strong), under the new Grand Vizier, Halil Pasha, had arrived on the plateau east of the city to relieve the garrison.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria'', III, p. 102</ref> News spread through Europe of Eugene's imminent destruction; but he had no intention of lifting the siege.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 165</ref> With his men suffering from [[dysentery]], and continuous bombardment from the plateau, Eugene, aware that a decisive victory alone could extricate his army, decided to attack the relief force. On the morning of 16 August 40,000 Imperial troops marched through the fog, caught the Turks unaware, and routed Halil Pasha's army; a week later Belgrade surrendered, effectively bringing an end to the war. The victory was the crowning point of Eugene's military career and had confirmed him as the leading European general. His ability to snatch victory at the moment of defeat had shown the Prince at his best.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 166</ref>\n\nThe principal objectives of the war had been achieved: the task Eugene had begun at Zenta was complete, and the Karlowitz settlement secured. By the terms of  the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]], signed on 21 July 1718, the Turks surrendered the [[Banat of Temeswar]], along with Belgrade and most of Serbia, although they regained the Morea from the Venetians. The war had dispelled the immediate Turkish threat to Hungary, and was a triumph for the Empire and for Eugene personally.<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 221.

Eugene served Emperor Charles VI for the last 25 years of his life.]]\n\nWhile Eugene fought the Turks in the east, unresolved issues following the Utrecht/Rastatt settlements led to hostilities between the Emperor and Philip V of Spain in the west. Charles VI had refused to recognise Philip V as King of Spain, a title which he himself claimed; in return, Philip V had refused to renounce his claims to Naples, Milan, and the Netherlands, all of which had transferred to the House of Austria following the Spanish Succession war. Philip V was roused by his influential wife, [[Elisabeth Farnese]], daughter of the [[Odoardo Farnese, Hereditary Prince of Parma|Hereditary Prince of Parma]], who personally held dynastic claims in the name of her son, [[Charles III of Spain|Don Charles]], to the duchies of [[Tuscany]], [[Province of Parma|Parma]] and [[Province of Piacenza|Piacenza]].<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 106</ref> Representatives from a newly formed [[Triple Alliance (1717)|Anglo-French alliance]]\u2014who were desirous of European peace for their own dynastic securities and trade opportunities\u2014called on both parties to recognise each other's sovereignty. Yet Philip V remained intractable, and on 22 August 1717 his chief minister, [[Giulio Alberoni|Alberoni]], effected the invasion of Austrian [[Sardinia]] in what seemed like the beginning of the reconquest of Spain's former Italian empire.<ref name=mckay170>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 170</ref>\n\nEugene returned to Vienna from his recent victory at Belgrade (before the conclusion of the Turkish war) determined to prevent an escalation of the conflict, complaining that, \"two wars cannot be waged with one army\";<ref name=mckay170/> only reluctantly did the Prince release some troops from the Balkans for the Italian campaign. Rejecting all diplomatic overtures Philip V unleashed another assault in June 1718, this time against Savoyard [[Sicily]] as a preliminary to attacking the Italian mainland. Realising that only the [[Royal Navy|British fleet]] could prevent further Spanish landings, and that pro-Spanish groups in France might push the [[regent]], [[Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], into war against Austria, Charles VI had no option but to sign the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]] on 2 August 1718, and formally renounce his claim to Spain.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria, '' III, 108</ref> Despite the Spanish fleet's destruction off [[Battle of Cape Passaro|Cape Passaro]], Philip V and Elisabeth remained resolute, and rejected the treaty.\n\nAlthough Eugene could have gone south after the conclusion of the Turkish war, he chose instead to conduct operations from Vienna; but Austria's military effort in Sicily proved derisory, and Eugene's chosen commanders, [[Johann Hieronymus Freiherr von und Zum Jungen|Zum Jungen]], and later [[Count Claude Florimond de Mercy|Count Mercy]], performed poorly.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 172. Isolated Spanish troops held on around [[Palermo]] till the end of 1719, while no expedition could even be attempted on Sardinia.</ref> It was only from pressure exerted by the French army advancing into the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque]] provinces of northern Spain in April 1719, and the British Navy's attacks on the Spanish fleet and shipping, that compelled Philip V and Elisabeth to dismiss Alberoni and join the Quadruple Alliance on 25 January 1720. Nevertheless, the Spanish attacks had strained Charles VI's government, causing tension between the Emperor and his Spanish Council<ref>The Spanish Council consisted of Spaniards and Italians who had followed Charles VI from Spain after the Spanish Succession war. The most senior member of the council and an implacable enemy of Eugene was the Archbishop of Valencia, [[Antonio Folch de Cardona]]; but the most important members were [[Count Rocco Stella|Count Stella]] and the [[Marquis Ramon de Rialp]]. The council controlled Charles VI's lands in Italy.</ref> on the one hand, and the conference, headed by Eugene, on the other. Despite Charles VI's own personal ambitions in the Mediterranean it was clear to the Emperor that Eugene had put the safeguarding of his conquests in Hungary before everything else, and that military failure in Sicily also had to rest on Eugene. Consequently, the Prince's influence over the Emperor declined considerably.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 177</ref>\n\n==Later life (1721\u201336)==\n\n===Governor-General of the Southern Netherlands===\nEugene had become governor of the [[Southern Netherlands]]\u2014then the [[Austrian Netherlands]]\u2014in June 1716, but he was an absent ruler, directing policy from Vienna through his chosen representative the [[Hercule-Louis Turinetti, marquis of Pri\u00e9|Marquis of Pri\u00e9]].<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 180. Eugene was reluctant to leave his palaces and friends: it would probably have meant his resignation from his chief interest, the war council.</ref> De Pri\u00e9 proved unpopular with the local population and the guilds who, following the [[Barrier Treaty]] of 1715, were obliged to meet the financial demands of the administration and the Dutch barrier garrisons; with Eugene's backing and encouragement civil disturbances in Antwerp and Brussels were forcibly suppressed. After displeasing the Emperor over his initial opposition to the formation of the [[Ostend Company]], de Pri\u00e9 also lost the support of the native nobility from within his own council of state in Brussels, particularly from the [[Jean-Philippe-Eug\u00e8ne de M\u00e9rode-Westerloo|Marquis de M\u00e9rode-Westerloo]]. One of Eugene's former favourites, [[Claude Alexandre de Bonneval|General Bonneval]], also joined the nobles in opposition to de Pri\u00e9, further undermining the Prince. When de Pri\u00e9's position became untenable Eugene felt compelled to resign his post as governor on 16 November 1724. As compensation Charles VI conferred on him the honorary position as [[vicar-general]] of Italy, worth 140,000 gulden a year, and an estate at [[Siebenbrunn]] in [[Lower Austria]] said to be worth double that amount.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 186. De Pri\u00e9 stood down in the spring of 1725 to avoid dismissal.</ref> But his resignation distressed him, and to compound his concerns Eugene caught a severe bout of [[influenza]] that Christmas, marking the beginning of permanent [[bronchitis]] and acute infections every winter for the remaining twelve years of his life.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 187</ref>\n\n==='Cold war'===\n[[File:Portrait of Prince Eugene.jpg|thumb|170px|Prince Eugene by [[Jan Kupeck\u00fd]].]]\n\nThe 1720s saw rapidly changing alliances between the European powers and almost constant diplomatic confrontation, largely over unsolved issues regarding the Quadruple Alliance. The Emperor and the Spanish King continued to use each other's titles, and Charles VI still refused to remove the remaining legal obstacles to Don Charles' eventual succession to the duchies of Parma and Tuscany. Yet in a surprise move Spain and Austria moved closer with the signing of the [[Treaty of Vienna (1725)|Treaty of Vienna]] in April/May 1725.<ref>Philip V and Elisabeth approached Austria to exploit Charles VI's isolation, and his differences with the Maritime Powers over the Ostend Company. They intended to conclude marriage alliances for their two sons to the Emperor's daughters, aiming to bring their children control of Habsburg hereditary lands and most of Italy.</ref> In response Britain, France, and Prussia joined together in the [[Treaty of Hanover (1725)|Alliance of Hanover]] to counter the danger to Europe of an Austro-Spanish hegemony.<ref>Hatton: ''George I,'' 274\u201375: Sweden, Denmark, and the Dutch Republic signed the Treaty of Hanover in 1727.</ref> For the next three years there was the continual threat of war between the Hanover Treaty powers and the Austro-Spanish bloc.\n\nFrom 1726 Eugene gradually began to regain his political influence. With his many contacts throughout Europe Eugene, backed by Gundaker Starhemberg and Count [[Frederick Charles, count von Sch\u00f6nborn|Sch\u00f6nborn]], the Imperial vice-chancellor, managed to secure powerful allies and strengthen the Emperor's position\u2014his skill in managing the vast secret diplomatic network over the coming years was the main reason why Charles VI once again came to depend upon him.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 213</ref> In August 1726 Russia acceded to the Austro-Spanish alliance, and in October [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William]] of Prussia followed suit by defecting from the Allies with the signing of a mutual defensive treaty with the Emperor.<ref>Coxe: ''History of the House of Austria,'' III, 139. The Allies failed to support Frederick William's claims to [[Duchy of J\u00fclich|J\u00fclich-Berg]].</ref> Despite the conclusion of the brief [[Anglo-Spanish War (1727)|Anglo-Spanish conflict]], war between the European powers persisted throughout 1727\u201328. However, in 1729 Elisabeth Farnese abandoned the Austro-Spanish alliance. Realizing that Charles VI could not be drawn into the marriage pact she wanted, Elisabeth concluded that the best way to secure her son's succession to Parma and Tuscany now lay with Britain and France. To Eugene it was 'an event that which is seldom to be found in history'.<ref name=mckay219>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 219</ref> Following the Prince's determined lead to resist all pressure, Charles VI sent troops into Italy to prevent the entry of Spanish garrisons into the contested duchies. By the beginning of 1730 Eugene, who had remained bellicose throughout the whole period, was again in control of Austrian policy.<ref name=mckay219/>\n\n[[File:Alliances in Europe 1725-1730.png|thumb|300px|left|Coalitions in Europe between 1725 and 1730.

Prussia, in brown, first joined the Hanoverian Alliance, but later changed sides after the [[Treaty of Berlin (1728)|Treaty of Berlin]] on December 23, 1728.]]\nIn Britain there now emerged a new political re-alignment as the Anglo-French ''entente'' became increasingly defunct.<ref>Simms: ''Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire,'' 218</ref> Believing that a resurgent France now posed the greatest danger to their security British ministers, headed by [[Robert Walpole]], moved to reform the Anglo-Austrian alliance, leading to the signing of the [[Treaty of Vienna (1731)|Second Treaty of Vienna]] on 16 March 1731.<ref>Simms: ''Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire,'' 215\u201319; McKay and Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers: 1648\u20131815,'' 136</ref> Eugene had been the Austrian minister most responsible for the alliance, believing once again it would provide security against France and Spain. The treaty compelled Charles VI to sacrifice the Ostend Company (a rival to the English and Dutch trading companies) and accept, unequivocally, the accession of Don Charles to Parma and Tuscany. In return King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] as King of Great Britain and Elector of Hanover guaranteed the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], the device to secure the rights of the Emperor's daughter, [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]], to the entire Habsburg inheritance. It was largely through Eugene's diplomacy that in January 1732 the Imperial diet also guaranteed the Pragmatic Sanction which, together with the Treaties with Britain, Russia, and Prussia, marked the culmination of  the Prince's diplomacy. But the Treaty of Vienna had infuriated the court of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]: the French had been ignored and the Pragmatic Sanction guaranteed, thus increasing Habsburg influence and confirming Austria's vast territorial size. The Emperor also intended Maria Theresa to marry [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis Stephen]] of Lorraine which would present an unacceptable threat on France's border. By the beginning of 1733 the French army was ready for war: all that was needed was the excuse.<ref>McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers: 1648\u20131815,'' 136\u201337</ref>\n\n===War of the Polish Succession===\n{{Main|War of the Polish Succession }}\n[[File:Prince Eugene of Savoy - Kupetzky.jpg|thumb|170px|Portrait of Prince Eugene of Savoy by Jan Kupeck\u00fd. Shown here in late middle age.]]\n\nIn 1733 the Polish King and Elector of Saxony, [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus the Strong]], died. There were two candidates for his successor: first, [[Stanis\u0142aw Leszczy\u0144ski]], the father-in-law of Louis XV; second, the Elector of Saxony's son, [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus]], supported by Russia, Austria, and Prussia. The Polish succession had afforded Louis XV's chief minister, [[Andr\u00e9-Hercule de Fleury|Fleury]], the opportunity to attack Austria and take Lorraine from Francis Stephen. In order to gain Spanish support France backed the succession of Elisabeth Farnese's sons to further Italian lands.<ref>Simms: ''Three Victories and a Defeat: The Rise and Fall of the First British Empire,'' 231; McKay & Scott: ''The Rise of the Great Powers: 1648\u20131815,'' 141</ref>\n\nEugene entered the [[War of the Polish Succession]] as President of the Imperial War Council and commander-in-chief of the army, but he was severely handicapped by the quality of his troops and the shortage of funds; now in his seventies, the Prince was also burdened by rapidly declining physical and mental powers. France declared war on Austria on 10 October 1733, but without the funds from the Maritime Powers\u2014who, despite the Vienna treaty, remained neutral throughout the war\u2014Austria could not hire the necessary troops to wage an offensive campaign. \"The danger to the monarchy,\" wrote Eugene to the Emperor in October, \"cannot be exaggerated\".<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' 278</ref> By the end of the year Franco-Spanish forces had seized Lorraine and Milan; by early 1734 Spanish troops had taken Sicily.\n\n[[File:Stadtpalais Prinz Eugen1.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Eugene's [[Winter Palace of Prince Eugene|Stadtpalais]], Vienna, where he conducted most of his business.]]\n\nEugene took command on the Rhine in April 1734, but vastly outnumbered he was forced onto the defensive. In June Eugene set out to relieve [[Philippsburg]], yet his former drive and energy was now gone. Accompanying Eugene was a young [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]], sent by his father to learn the art of war. Frederick gained considerable knowledge from Eugene, recalling in later life his great debt to his Austrian mentor, but the Prussian prince was aghast at Eugene's condition, writing later, \"his body was still there but his soul had gone.\"<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 239</ref> Eugene conducted another cautious campaign in 1735, once again pursuing a sensible defensive strategy on limited resources; but his short-term memory was by now practically non-existent, and his political influence disappeared completely\u2014[[Gundaker Thomas Starhemberg|Gundaker Starhemberg]] and [[Johann Christoph von Bartenstein]] now dominated the conference in his place. However, fortunately for Charles VI Fleury was determined to limit the scope of the war, and in October 1735 he granted generous peace preliminaries to the Emperor.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 240</ref>\n\n===Last years and death===\n\nDuring the last 20 years of his life Eugene was particularly close to Countess Eleonora Batthy\u00e1ny, daughter of Count [[Theodor von Strattman]].<ref>There was one reference to another woman before Batthy\u00e1ny. The Swedish minister in Vienna makes reference to Countess Maria Th\u00fcrheim. There is, however, no evidence for or against this suggestion.</ref>\nMuch about their acquaintance remains speculative (Eugene never mentions her in any of his surviving letters), and there is certainly no suggestion of a sexual relationship, but although they lived apart most foreign diplomats regarded Eleonora as his \"official lover\". Eugene and Eleonora were constant companions, meeting for dinner, receptions and card games almost every day till his death. But their surviving correspondence does not indicate any real intimacy in the relationship. Eugene's other friends such as the papal [[nuncio]], [[Domenico Silvio Passionei|Passionei]], made up for the family he still lacked.\n\nFor his only surviving nephew, Emmanuel, the son of his brother Louis Thomas, Eugene arranged a marriage with one of the daughters of Prince Liechtenstein, but Emmanuel died of smallpox in 1729. With the death of Emmanuel's son in 1734, no close male relatives remained to succeed the Prince. His closest relative, therefore, was Louis Thomas's unmarried daughter, [[Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Savoy]], whom Eugene had never met and, as he had heard nothing but bad of her, made no effort to do so.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 203</ref>\n\nEugene returned to Vienna from the War of the Polish Succession in October 1735, weak and feeble; when Maria Theresa and Francis Stephen married in February 1736 Eugene was too ill to attend. After playing cards at Countess Batthy\u00e1ny's on the evening of 20 April he returned to his bed at the [[Winter Palace of Prince Eugene|Stadtpalais]]. When his servants arrived to wake him the next morning, 21 April 1736, they found Prince Eugene dead after choking from phlegm in his throat, presumably after suffering from [[pneumonia]]. Eugene's heart was buried with those of others of his family in Turin. His remains were carried in a long procession to [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], where the body was interred in the ''Kreuzkapelle''.<ref name=mckay243>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy,'' 243</ref>\n\nCountess Batthy\u00e1ny expressed in a letter dated 23 December 1720, that at the ''Kreuzkapelle'' a solemn requiem would be held annually. She dedicated for this purpose two thousand guilders.<ref>[http://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:Strattmann,_Theodor_von  Strattmann, Theodor Heinrich, von Hanns Schlitter in: [[Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie]], herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der [[Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften]], Band 36 (1893), S. 518\u2013520]</ref>\n\n==Patron of the arts==\n[[File:Portrait of Prince Eugene of Savoy Carignano.png|thumb|170px|Portrait of Prince Eugene by Jacob van Schuppen.]]\n\nEugene's rewards for his victories, his share of booty, his revenues from his abbeys in Savoy, and a steady income from his Imperial offices and governorships, enabled him to contribute to the landscape of [[Baroque architecture]].<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 189. Eugene's presidency of the Imperial War Council was probably worth 100,000 [[Guilder|gulden]] a year, while his governorships of Milan and the Netherlands were likely to have brought in 150,000 gulden annually.</ref> Eugene spent most of his life in Vienna at his Winter Palace, the [[Winter Palace of Prince Eugene|Stadtpalais]], built by [[Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach|Fischer von Erlach]]. The palace acted as his official residence and home, but for reasons that remain speculative the Prince's association with Fischer ended before the building was complete, favouring instead [[Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt]] as his chief architect.<ref>There is no indication of a quarrel with Erlach, just a desired change in style. Hildebrandt had accompanied Eugene in Italy as his siege engineer in 1695\u201396 and made Imperial court engineer in 1701.</ref> Eugene first employed Hildebrandt to finish the Stadtpalais before commissioning him to  prepare plans for a palace ([[Savoy Castle]]) on his Danubian island at [[R\u00e1ckeve]]. Began in 1701 the single-story building took twenty years to complete; yet, probably because of the [[R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence|R\u00e1k\u00f3czi revolt]], the Prince seems to have visited it only once\u2014after the [[Siege of Belgrade (1717)|siege of Belgrade]] in 1717.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 193</ref>\n\n[[File:Wien - Schloss Belvedere, oberes (1).JPG|left|thumb|250px|Upper Belvedere, Vienna.]]\n\nOf more importance was the grandiose complex of the two [[Belvedere (palace)|Belvedere]] palaces in Vienna. The single-storey Lower Belvedere, with its exotic gardens and zoo, was completed in 1716. The Upper Belvedere, completed between 1720 and 1722, is a more substantial building; with sparkling white stucco walls and copper roof it became a wonder of Europe. Eugene and Hildebrandt also converted an existing structure on his Marchfeld estate into a country seat, the [[Schloss Hof|Schlosshof]], situated between the Rivers Danube and [[Morava (river)|Morava]].<ref>Eugene had purchased this land in 1726.</ref> The building, completed in 1729, was far less elaborate than his other projects but it was strong enough to serve as a fortress in case of need. Eugene spent much of his spare time there in his last years accommodating large hunting parties.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 195. Maria Theresa brought the Schlosshof in 1755.</ref>\n\nIn the years following the Peace of Rastatt Eugene became acquainted with a large number of scholarly men. Given his position and responsiveness they were keen to meet him: few could exist without patronage and this was probably the main reason for [[Gottfried Leibniz]]'s association with him in 1714.<ref>McKay: ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 199. The German philosopher got to know the Prince during his visit to Vienna in 1714, trying to persuade Charles VI to found an Academy of Science.</ref> Eugene also befriended the French writer [[Jean-Baptiste Rousseau]] who, by 1716, was receiving financial support from Eugene. Rousseau stayed on attached to the Prince's household, probably helping in the library, until he left for the Netherlands in 1722.<ref>Rousseau had not been long in the Netherlands before he joined the conspiracy to remove Eugene from the post of Governor General.</ref> Another acquaintance, [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], already famous for his ''[[Persian Letters]]'' when he arrived in Vienna in 1728, favourably recalled his time spent at the Prince's table. Nevertheless, Eugene had no literary pretensions of his own, and was not tempted like [[Maurice de Saxe]] or Marshal Villars to write his memoirs or books on the art of war. He did, however, become a collector on the grandest scale: his picture galleries were filled with 16th- and 17th-century Italian, Dutch and Flemish art;<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 256. Amongst the list of artists who worked for Eugene was the Italian, [[Giuseppe Crespi|Giuseppe Maria Crespi]].</ref> his library at the Stadtpalais crammed with over 15,000 books, 237 manuscripts as well as a huge collection of prints (of particular interest were books on natural history and geography). \"It is hardly believable,\" wrote Rousseau, \"that a man who carries on his shoulders the burden of almost all the affairs of Europe \u2026 should find as much time to read as though he had nothing else to do.\"<ref>Henderson: ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. 259</ref> At Eugene's death his possessions and estates, except those in Hungary which the crown reclaimed, went to his niece, Princess Maria Anna Victoria, who at once decided to sell everything. The artwork was bought by [[Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia]]. Eugene's library, prints and drawings were purchased by the Emperor in 1737 and have since passed into Austrian national collections.<ref name=mckay243/>\n\n==Assessment==\n[[File:Wien - Heldenplatz, Prinz-Eugen-Denkmal (2).JPG|250px|thumb|Eugene's monument in [[Heldenplatz]], Vienna, by [[Anton Dominik Fernkorn]].]]\n\n[[Napoleon]] considered Eugene one of the seven greatest commanders of history.<ref>Henderson, ''Prince Eugen of Savoy,'' xi. The others were [[Alexander the Great]], [[Hannibal]], [[Julius Caesar]], [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus Aldolphus]], [[Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne|Turenne]], and [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]].</ref> Although later military critics have disagreed with that assessment, Eugene was undoubtedly the greatest Austrian general.<ref name=mckay246>McKay, ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 246\u2013247</ref> He was no military innovator, but he had the ability to make an inadequate system work. He was equally adept as an organizer, strategist, and tactician, believing in the primacy of battle and his ability to seize the opportune moment to launch a successful attack.<ref name=mckay246/> \"The important thing,\" wrote Maurice de Saxe in his ''Reveries'', \"is to see the opportunity and to know how to use it. Prince Eugene possessed this quality which is the greatest in the art of war and which is the test of the most elevated genius.\"<ref>De Saxe, Maurice. ''Reveries on the Art of War'', p. 119</ref> This fluidity was key to his battlefield successes in Italy and in his wars against the Turks. Nevertheless, in the Low Countries, particularly after the battle of Oudenarde in 1708, Eugene, like his cousin Louis of Baden, tended to play safe and become bogged down in a conservative strategy of sieges and defending supply lines. After the attempt on Toulon in 1707, he also became very wary of combined land/sea operations.<ref name=chandler224/> To historian Derek McKay, however, the main criticism of him as a general is his legacy\u2014he left no school of officers nor an army able to function without him.<ref name=mckay246/>\n\n[[File:Budapest princ Eugen 2.jpg|thumb|170px|left|Eugene's statue, [[Buda Castle]], Budapest, Hungary.]]\n\nEugene was a disciplinarian\u2014when ordinary soldiers disobeyed orders he was prepared to shoot them himself\u2014but he rejected blind brutality, writing \"you should only be harsh when, as often happens, kindness proves useless\".<ref name=mckay228>McKay, ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 228\u2013232</ref> On the battlefield Eugene demanded courage in his subordinates, and expected his men to fight where and when he wanted; his criteria for promotion were based primarily on obedience to orders and courage on the battlefield rather than social position. On the whole his men responded because he was willing to push himself as hard as them. However, his position as President of the Imperial War Council proved less successful. Following the long period of peace after the Austro-Turkish War, the idea of creating a separate field army or providing garrison troops with effective training for them to be turned into such an army quickly was never considered by Eugene. By the time of the War of the Polish Succession, therefore, the Austrians were outclassed by a better prepared French force. For this Eugene was largely to blame\u2014in his view (unlike the drilling and manoeuvres carried out by the Prussians which to Eugene seemed irrelevant to real warfare) the time to create actual fighting men was when war came.<ref name=mckay228/> But although Frederick the Great had been struck by the muddle of the Austrian army and its poor organisation during the Polish Succession war, he later amended his initial harsh judgements. \"If I understand anything of my trade,\" commented Frederick in 1758, \"especially in the more difficult aspects, I owe that advantage to Prince Eugene. From him I learnt to hold grand objectives constantly in view, and direct all my resources to those ends.\"<ref name=duffy17>Duffy, ''Frederick the Great: A Military Life'', p. 17</ref> To historian [[Christopher Duffy]] it was this awareness of the 'grand strategy' that was Eugene's legacy to Frederick.<ref name=duffy17/>\n\nTo his responsibilities Eugene attached his own personal values\u2014physical courage, loyalty to his sovereign, honesty, self-control in all things\u2014and he expected these qualities from his commanders. Eugene's approach was dictatorial, but he was willing to co-operate with someone he regarded as his equal, such as Baden or Marlborough. Yet the contrast to his co-commander of the Spanish Succession war were stark. \"Marlborough,\" wrote Churchill, \"was the model husband and father, concerned with building up a home, founding a family, and gathering a fortune to sustain it\"; whereas Eugene, the bachelor, was \"disdainful of money, content with his bright sword and his lifelong animosities against Louis XIV.<ref>Churchill, Winston. ''Marlborough: His Life and Times, Bk. 1'', II, pp. 774\u2013775</ref> The result was an austere figure, inspiring respect and admiration rather than affection.<ref>McKay, ''Prince Eugene of Savoy'', p. 248</ref> The huge equestrian statue in the centre of Vienna commemorates Eugene's achievements. It is inscribed on one side, 'To the wise counsellor of three Emperors', and on the other, 'To the glorious conqueror of Austria's enemies'.<ref>Henderson, ''Prince Eugen of Savoy'', p. xi</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nSeveral ships have been named in Eugene's honour: ''[[SMS Prinz Eugen (1912)|Prinz Eugen]]'', an Austrian World War I battleship; an [[SMS Prinz Eugen (1877)|Austrian central battery ship]] with the same name from 1878; the [[HMS Prince Eugene (1915)|HMS ''Prince Eugene'']], British Royal Navy World War I monitor; Italian light cruiser {{ship|Italian cruiser|Eugenio di Savoia||2}} and the [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|German cruiser ''Prinz Eugen'']] (later USS ''Prinz Eugen''), a World War II heavy cruiser.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Prince Eugene of Savoy}}\n*[[Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter]]\n*[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|20 euro Baroque commemorative coin]] \n*[[7th SS Volunteer Mountain Division Prinz Eugen]]\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=October 2017}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n| boxstyle_1 = background-color: #fcc;\n| boxstyle_2 = background-color: #fb9;\n| boxstyle_3 = background-color: #ffc;\n| boxstyle_4 = background-color: #bfc;\n| boxstyle_5 = background-color: #9fe;\n| 1 = 1.

Due to his anti-academic attitude, he studied only one year at the academy (in the class of Director [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow|Schadow]]). Mainly Leutze was affected by the painter [[Karl Friedrich Lessing|Lessing]].<ref>Wolfgang M\u00fcller von K\u00f6nigswinter: ''D\u00fcsseldorfer K\u00fcnstler aus den letzten f\u00fcnfundzwanzig Jahren''. 1854, S. 139.</ref> In 1842 he went to [[Munich]], studying the works of [[Peter von Cornelius|Cornelius]] and Kaulbach, and, while there, finished his ''Columbus before the Queen''.

His first work, ''[[Columbus before the Council of Salamanca]]'' was purchased by the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Union. A companion picture, ''Columbus in Chains'', procured him the gold medal of the Brussels Art Exhibition, and was subsequently purchased by the Art Union in New York; it was the basis of the 1893 $2 [[Columbian Issue]] stamp.

Using American tourists and art students as models and assistants, Leutze finished a first version of ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'' in 1850.  Just after it was completed, the first version was damaged by fire in his studio, subsequently restored, and acquired by the Kunsthalle Bremen. On September 5, 1942, during World War II, it was destroyed in a bombing raid by the Allied forces. The second painting, a replica of the first, only larger, was ordered 1850 by the Parisian art trader Adolphe Goupil for his New York branch and placed on exhibition on Broadway in October 1851.<ref>Barratt, Carrie Rebora (2011).

Although his father Tilemann Alber was a schoolmaster, his early education was neglected. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nUltimately in 1518 he found his way to the [[University of Wittenberg]], where he studied theology. He had the good fortune to attract the attention of [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and subsequently became one of Luther's most active helpers in the [[Protestant Reformation]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nNot only did he fight for the Protestant cause as a preacher and theologian, but he was almost the only member of Luther's party who was able to confront the [[Roman Catholics]] with the weapon of literary satire. In 1542 he published a prose satire to which Luther wrote the preface, ''Der Barfusser Monche Eulenspiegel und Alkoran,'' a parodic adaptation of the ''Liber conformitatum'' of the Franciscan [[Bartolommeo Rinonico]] of [[Pisa]], in which the [[Franciscan]] order is held up to ridicule.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOf higher literary value is the didactic and satirical ''Buch von der Tugend und Weisheit'' (1550), a collection of forty-nine fables in which Alberus embodies his views on the relations of [[Church and state in medieval Europe|Church and State]]. His satire is incisive, but in a scholarly and humanistic way; it does not appeal to popular passions with the fierce directness which enabled the master of [[Catholic]] satire, [[Thomas Murner]], to inflict such telling blows.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nSeveral of Alberus's hymns, all of which show the influence of his master Luther, have been retained in the German Protestant hymnal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nAfter Luther's death, Alberus was for a time a deacon in [[Wittenberg]]; he became involved, however, in the political conflicts of the time, and was in [[Magdeburg]] in 1550\u20131551, while that town was besieged by [[Maurice, Elector of Saxony]].

It performs particularly well when the rules are written [[left recursion|left-recursively]].\n\n== Earley recogniser ==\nThe following algorithm describes the Earley recogniser. The recogniser can be easily modified to create a parse tree as it recognises, and in that way can be turned into a parser.\n\n== The algorithm ==\nIn the following descriptions, \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 represent any [[string (computer science)|string]] of [[Terminal and nonterminal symbols|terminals/nonterminals]] (including the [[empty string]]), X and Y represent single nonterminals, and ''a'' represents a terminal symbol.\n\nEarley's algorithm is a top-down [[dynamic programming]] algorithm. In the following, we use Earley's dot notation: given a [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|production]] X \u2192 \u03b1\u03b2, the notation X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 \u03b2 represents a condition in which \u03b1 has already been parsed and \u03b2 is expected.\n\nInput position 0 is the position prior to input.  Input position ''n'' is the position after accepting the ''n''th token.  (Informally, input positions can be thought of as locations at [[Lexical analysis|token]] boundaries.)  For every input position, the parser generates a ''state set''.  Each state is a [[tuple]] (X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 \u03b2, ''i''), consisting of\n\n* the production currently being matched (X \u2192 \u03b1 \u03b2)\n* our current position in that production (represented by the dot)\n* the position ''i'' in the input at which the matching of this production began: the ''origin position''\n\n(Earley's original algorithm included a look-ahead in the state; later research showed this to have little practical effect on the parsing efficiency, and it has subsequently been dropped from most implementations.)\n\nThe state set at input position ''k'' is called S(''k'').  The parser is seeded with S(0) consisting of only the top-level rule.  The parser then repeatedly executes three operations:  ''prediction'', ''scanning'', and ''completion''.\n\n* ''Prediction'':  For every state in S(''k'') of the form (X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 Y \u03b2, ''j'') (where ''j'' is the origin position as above), add (Y \u2192 \u2022 \u03b3, ''k'') to S(''k'') for every production in the grammar with Y on the left-hand side (Y \u2192 \u03b3).\n* ''Scanning'': If ''a'' is the next symbol in the input stream, for every state in S(''k'') of the form (X \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 ''a'' \u03b2, ''j''), add (X \u2192 \u03b1 ''a'' \u2022 \u03b2, ''j'') to S(''k''+1).\n* ''Completion'': For every state in S(''k'') of the form (X \u2192 \u03b3 \u2022, ''j''), find states in S(''j'') of the form (Y \u2192 \u03b1 \u2022 X \u03b2, ''i'') and add (Y \u2192 \u03b1 X \u2022 \u03b2, ''i'') to S(''k'').\n\nIt is important to note that duplicate states are not added to the state set, only new ones.  These three operations are repeated until no new states can be added to the set.  The set is generally implemented as a queue of states to process, with the operation to be performed depending on what kind of state it is.\n\nThe algorithm accepts if (X \u2192 \u03b3 \u2022, 0) ends up in S(''n''), where (X \u2192 \u03b3) is the top level-rule and ''n'' the input length, otherwise it rejects.\n\n== Pseudocode ==\nAdapted from Speech and Language Processing<ref name=Jurafsky>{{cite book|last=Jurafsky|first=D.|title=Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131873216|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fZmj5UNK8AQC}}</ref> by Daniel Jurafsky and James H.

A node's contents are either a pair of child pointers giving a single derivation, or a list of \"packed\" nodes each containing a pair of pointers and representing one derivation.  SPPF nodes are unique (there is only one with a given label), but may contain more than one derivation for ambiguous parses.  So even if an operation does not add an Earley item (because it already exists), it may still add a derivation to the item's parse forest.\n\n* Predicted items have a null SPPF pointer.\n* The scanner creates an SPPF node representing the non-terminal it is scanning.\n* Then when the scanner or completer advance an item, they add a derivation whose children are the node from the item whose dot was advanced, and the one for the new symbol that was advanced over (the non-terminal or completed item).\n\nNote also that SPPF nodes are never labeled with a completed LR(0) item: instead they are labelled with the symbol that is produced so that all derivations are combined under one node regardless of which alternative production they come from.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[CYK algorithm]]\n* [[Context-free grammar]]\n* [[List of algorithms#Parsing|Parsing Algorithms]]\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Other reference materials ==\n*{{cite book\n | last1 = Aycock | first1 = John\n | last2 = Horspool | first2 = R.

However, the word ''keiy'' is usually not necessary, as the spicy variety is assumed when it is omitted (e.g. ''doro wat''). The term ''atkilt wat'' is sometimes used to refer to all vegetable dishes, but a more specific name can also be used (as in ''dinich'na caroht wat'', which translates to \"potatoes and carrots stew\"; but notice the word \"atkilt\" is usually omitted when using the more specific term).\n\n===Tibs===\n{{Redirect|Tibs}}\nMeat along with vegetables are [[Saut\u00e9ing|saut\u00e9ed]] to make ''tibs'' (also ''tebs'', ''t'ibs'', ''tibbs'', etc., Ge'ez: \u1325\u1265\u1235 ''\u1e6dibs''). Tibs is served in a variety of manners, and can range from hot to mild or contain little to no vegetables. There are many variations of the delicacy, depending on type, size or shape of the cuts of meat used. \n \nThe mid-18th century European visitor to Ethiopia [[Remedius Prutky]] describes ''tibs'' as a portion of grilled meat served \"to pay a particular compliment or show especial respect to someone.\"<ref>J.H. Arrowsmith-Brown (trans.), ''Prutky's Travels in Ethiopia and other Countries'' with notes by Richard Pankhurst (London: Hakluyt Society, 1991), p. 286</ref> This is perhaps still true as the dish is still prepared today to commemorate special events and holidays.\n\n===Kinche (Qinch'e)===\n\nKinche (Qinch\u2019e) is a very common Ethiopian breakfast, its equivalent of [[oatmeal]].  It\u2019s incredibly simple, inexpensive, and nutritious.  It is made from cracked wheat. It can be boiled in either milk or water.  The flavor of the Kinche comes from the nit'ir qibe, which is a spiced butter.<ref>slow food foundation for biodiversity</ref>\n\n===Oromo dishes===\n\n[[File:Tibs in Yod Abyssinia.jpg|thumb|right|A ''tibs'' (''waadii'') dish at a restaurant in Yod Abyssinia, [[Addis Ababa]]]]\n*'''Waadii''' \u2013 also known as ''tibs''; specially seasoned\n*'''Anchotte''' \u2013 a common dish in the western part of Oromia (Wallaga)\n*'''Baduu''' \u2013 also known as ''aybe''\n*'''Marqaa''' \u2013 also known as ''genfo''\n*'''Chechebsa''' \u2013 also known as ''kita''\n*'''Qoocco''' \u2013 although also known as ''kocho'', it is not the Gurage type of kocho but a different kind; a common dish in the western part of Oromia (Wallaga)\n*'''Itto''' \u2013 also known as ''wat''; comprises all sorts of wat, including vegetables and mea\n*'''Chuuco''' \u2013 also known as ''besso''; a sweet flavor of whole grain, seasoned with butter and spices\nChuko,  barley conserved with butter, is traditional food of Oromia region in Ethiopia. It is traditionally made by women from barley powder mixed with a sufficient amount of distilled butter, along with ginger, onion, salt and spices. Chuko is easy to prepare in a short time, and is full of protein because of its barley content. To make it, first barley is husked and then roasted over a fire. It is then pounded into a powder. Over this powder, a sufficient amount of butter and spices is added, and mixed to create the finished, piquant product. Individual portions of chuko vary between 2 and 5&nbsp;kg. Chuko can be stored for up to a year without spoiling.\n\nChuko is both a part of the everyday diet and prepared for special events. It is popular among those on long journeys or away at university because of its long shelf life. It is also prepared for holidays and festivals. It is traditionally related with Oromo weddings, served by the bride\u2019s parents to the groom\u2019s best men. Chuko is mainly produced for home consumption, but can also be found at local markets.\n\nProduction of chuko is totally dependent on the production of barley. Therefore, in times of drought or bad harvests, production subsequently decreases. It is also becoming more difficult for many families to prepare due to the high price related to the large quantity of butter required. It is also slowly losing its importance related to wedding customs, and is being replaced by imported products new to the market, meaning fewer people are left who know how to and continue to prepare chuko.\n\nThe traditional products, local breeds, and know-how collected by the [[Ark of Taste]] belong to the communities that have preserved them over time\n\n*'''Chororsaa''' \u2013 a common dish in western part of Oromia (Wallaga)\n\n===Gurage dishes===\n\n====Kitfo====\n[[File:Kitfo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Kitfo]] served rare]]\nAnother distinctively Ethiopian dish is ''[[kitfo]]'' (frequently spelled ''ketfo''). It consists of raw (or rare) beef mince marinated in ''[[mitmita]]'' (Ge'ez: \u121a\u1325\u121a\u1323 ''m\u012b\u1e6dm\u012b\u1e6d\u0101'' a very spicy chili powder similar to the ''berbere'') and ''niter kibbeh''. ''[[Gored gored]]'' is very similar to ''kitfo'', but uses cubed rather than ground beef.\n\n====Ayibe====\n''Ayibe'' is a [[cottage cheese]] that is mild and crumbly. It is much closer in texture to crumbled [[feta]]. Although not quite pressed, the whey has been drained and squeezed out. It is often served as a side dish to soften the effect of very spicy food. It has little to no distinct taste of its own. However, when served separately, ayibe is often mixed with a variety of mild or hot spices typical of Gurage cuisine.\n\n====Gomen kitfo====\n''Gomen kitfo'' is another typical Gurage dish. [[Collard greens]] (\u130e\u1218\u1295 ''g\u014dmen'') are boiled, dried and then finely chopped and served with butter, chili and spices. It is a dish specially prepared for the occasion of [[Meskel]], a very popular holiday marking the discovery of the [[True Cross]]. It is served along with ''ayibe'' or sometimes even ''kitfo'' in this tradition called ''dengesa''.\n\n===Breakfast===\n[[File:Kitcha fit fit.png|thumb|[[Fit-fit]], or chechebsa, made with [[kitcha]] (unleavened bread), [[niter kibbeh]] (seasoned clarified butter) and [[berbere]] (spice), is a typical breakfast food.]]\n''[[Fit-fit]]'' or ''fir-fir'' is a common breakfast dish. It is made from shredded ''injera'' or ''[[kitcha]]'' stir-fried with spices or [[wat (food)|wat]]. Another popular breakfast food is ''fatira''. The delicacy consists of a large fried pancake made with flour, often with a layer of egg. It is eaten with honey. ''[[Kitcha fit-fit|Chechebsa]]'' (or ''kita firfir'') resembles a [[pancake]] covered with ''berbere'' and ''niter kibbeh'', or other spices, and may be eaten with a spoon. ''Genfo'' is a kind of [[porridge]], which is another common breakfast dish. It is usually served in a large bowl with a dug-out made in the middle of the genfo and filled with spiced ''niter kibbeh''. A variation of ''[[Shahan ful|ful]]'', a fava bean stew with condiments, served with baked rolls instead of ''injera'', is also common for breakfast.\n\n==Snacks==\nTypical Ethiopian snacks are [[Dabo Kolo]] (small pieces of baked bread that are similar to [[pretzel]]s) or ''kolo'' (roasted [[barley]] sometimes mixed with other local grains). ''Kolo'' made from roasted and spiced barley, sunflower kernels, chickpeas and/or peanuts are often sold by kiosks and street venders wrapped in a paper cone. Snacking on [[popcorn]] is also common.<ref name=\"gonomad\"/>\n\n==Beverages==\n===Coffee===\n[[File:Ethcofcerm.jpg|thumb|200px|An Ethiopian woman roasting coffee at a traditional [[coffee ceremony]]]]\nAccording to some sources, drinking of [[coffee]] (''buna'') is likely to have originated in Ethiopia.<ref name=\"gonomad\"/> A key national beverage, it is an important part of local commerce.<ref name=\"cia\">{{Cite web| title=Ethiopia | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/et.html | work=[[The World Factbook]] | publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] | date=12 January 2011 | accessdate=31 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[coffee ceremony]] is the traditional serving of coffee, usually after a big meal. It often involves the use of a ''[[jebena]]'' (\u1300\u1260\u1293), a clay coffee pot in which the coffee is boiled. The preparer roasts the coffee beans right in front of guests, then walks around wafting the smoke throughout the room so participants may sample the scent of coffee. Then the preparer grinds the coffee beans in a traditional tool called a ''mokecha''. The coffee is put into the ''jebena'', boiled with water, and then served with small cups called ''si'ni''. Coffee is usually served with sugar, but is also served with salt in many parts of Ethiopia. In some parts of the country, ''niter kibbeh'' is added instead of sugar or salt.\n\nSnacks, such as popcorn or toasted barley (or ''[[Dabo Kolo|Kolo]]''), are often served with the coffee. In most homes, a dedicated coffee area is surrounded by fresh grass, with special furniture for the coffee maker. A complete ceremony has three rounds of coffee (Abol, Tona and Bereka) and is accompanied by the burning of [[frankincense]].\n\n[[Tea]] (''Chai'') will most likely be served if coffee is declined.\n\n===Non-alcoholic brews===\n''Atmet'' is a barley and oat-flour based drink that is cooked with water, sugar and ''kibe'' (Ethiopian clarified butter) until the ingredients have combined to create a consistency slightly thicker than [[Eggnog|egg-nog]]. Though this drink is often given to women who are nursing, the sweetness and smooth texture make it a comfort drink for anyone who enjoys its flavor.\n\n===Manufactured drinks===\n[[File:Ethiopian Coca Cola bottle.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A [[Coca-Cola]] bottle in Ethiopia, with the distinct logo in the [[Ge'ez script|Ethiopic script]]]]\n[[Ambo Mineral Water]] or ''Ambo wuha'' is a bottled carbonated [[mineral water]], sourced from the springs in [[Ambo Senkele]] near the town of [[Ambo, Ethiopia|Ambo]].<ref name=\"gonomad\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.ambowater.com/aboutus.html|publisher=Ambo Mineral Water}}</ref>\n\n===Spirits===\n[[Tej]] is a potent honey wine.<ref name=\"gonomad\"/> It is similar to [[mead]], which is frequently served in bars (in particular, in a ''tej bet'' or \"tej house\").

''Tella'' is the most common beverage made and served in households during holidays.\n\n==Gursha==\nA ''gursha'' (var. ''gorsha'', ''goorsha'') is an act of friendship and love. When eating injera, a person uses his or her right hand to strip off a piece, wraps it around some ''wat'' or ''kitfo'', and then puts it into his or her mouth. During a meal with friends or family, it is a common custom to feed others in the group with one's hand by putting the rolled injera or a spoon full of other dishes into another's mouth.<ref>{{cite web |last=Selinus |first=Ruth |title=The Traditional Foods of the Central Ethiopian Highlands (research report no. 7) |url=http://ethnomed.org/clinical/nutrition/the-traditional-foods-of-the-central-ethiopian |publisher=EthnoMed |date=1 January 1971 |accessdate=1 November 2009}}</ref> This is called a ''gursha'', and the larger the gursha, the stronger the friendship or bond (only surpassed by the brewing of Tej together).

He wants his readers to mature in their faith in Christ by living what they say they believe. He condemns various [[sins]], including [[pride]], [[hypocrisy]], [[discrimination|favouritism]], and slander. He encourages believers to humbly live by godly rather than worldly wisdom and to pray in all situations.\n\nWithin the New Testament canon, the Epistle of James is noteworthy because it makes no reference to the death, resurrection, or divine sonship of Jesus. It refers to Jesus twice, as \"the Lord Jesus Christ\" and as \"our glorious Lord Jesus Christ\" (James 1:1, 2:1).\n\n== Authorship ==\n\nAccording to Robert J.

They view the epistle as having a legitimate purpose for its composition, a response to the suffering of its recipients.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\nA 2013 journal article<ref>Jim Reiher, \"Violent Language \u2013 a clue to the Historical Occasion of James.\" ''Evangelical Quarterly''. Vol. LXXXV No. 3. July 2013</ref> explores a violent historical background behind the epistle and offers the suggestion that it was indeed written by James, the brother of Jesus, and it was written before AD 62, the year he was killed.<ref>On the death of James, see [[Josephus]] Antiquities, 20.9.1 and [[Eusebius]] II.23.1-18.</ref> The 50s saw the growth of turmoil and violence in [[Roman Judea]], as Jews became more and more frustrated with corruption, injustice and poverty. It continued into the 60s, four years before James was killed. War broke out with Rome and would lead to the destruction of Jerusalem and the scattering of the people. The epistle is renowned for exhortations on fighting poverty and caring for the poor in practical ways (1:26\u201327; 2:1-4; 2:14-19; 5:1-6), standing up for the oppressed (2:1-4; 5:1-6) and not being \"like the world\" in the way one responds to evil in the world (1:26-27; 2:11; 3:13-18; 4:1-10). Worldly wisdom is rejected and people are exhorted to embrace heavenly wisdom, which includes peacemaking and pursuing righteousness and justice (3:13-18).\n\nThis approach sees the epistle as a real letter<ref>Numerous studies argue for a letter- structure to James. See, for example, Euan Fry, \"Commentaries on James, I and 2 Peter, and Jude,\" The Bible Translator, 41 (July 1990): 330, and F.O. Francis, \"The Form and Function of the Opening and Closing Paragraphs of James and I John,\" ZNW 61 (1970):110-126.</ref> with a real immediate purpose: to encourage Christian Jews not to revert to violence in their response to injustice and poverty but to stay focused on doing good, staying holy and to embrace the wisdom of heaven, not that of the world.{{Citation needed|reason=Your explanation here|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Doctrine ==\n\n=== Justification ===\n{{Main article|justification (theology)|Justification by faith alone|Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification}}\nIt contains the following famous passage concerning [[salvation]] and [[justification (theology)|justification]]:\n{{quote|<sup>14</sup>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works?

[[Gaius Marius Victorinus]] (4th century) associated James's teaching on works with the heretical Symmachian sect, followers of [[Symmachus the Ebionite]], and openly questioned whether James' teachings were heretical. This passage has also been contrasted with the teachings of [[Paul the Apostle]] on justification.

Paul countered this error by pointing out that salvation was by faith alone apart from deeds of the law (Galatians 2:16; Romans 3:21-22). Paul also taught that saving faith is not dead but alive, showing thanks to God in deeds of love (Galatians 5:6 ['...since in Christ Jesus it is not being circumcised or being uncircumcised that can effect anything - only faith working through love.']). James was dealing with errorists who said that if they had faith they didn't need to show love by a life of faith (James 2:14-17). James countered this error by teaching that faith is alive, showing itself to be so by deeds of love (James 2:18,26). James and Paul both teach that salvation is by faith alone and also that faith is never alone but shows itself to be alive by deeds of love that express a believer's thanks to God for the free gift of salvation by faith in Jesus.<ref name=WELS>{{cite web |url=http://www.wels.net/cgi-bin/site.pl?1518&cuTopic_topicID=19&cuItem_itemID=6343 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220114120/http://arkiv.lbk.cc/faq/site.pl%401518cutopic_topicid19cuitem_itemid6343.htm |archivedate=20 December 2013 |work=WELS Topical Q&A |title=Faith and Works |publisher=[[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]] |accessdate=30 Sep 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}\n\n=== Anointing of the Sick ===\nThe epistle is also the chief biblical text for the [[Anointing of the Sick]].

Because of the silence of several of the western churches regarding it, [[Eusebius]] classes it among the [[Antilegomena]] or contested writings (''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia ecclesiae]]'', 3.25; 2.23). [[Jerome]] gives a similar appraisal but adds that with time it had been universally admitted.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} [[Gaius Marius Victorinus]], in his commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians, openly questioned whether the teachings of James were heretical.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/878694940|title=Marius Victorinus' \"Commentary on Galatians\" : introduction, translation, and notes|last=1958-|first=Cooper, Stephen Andrew,|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=0198270275|location=|pages=265\u2013266|oclc=878694940}}</ref>\n\nIts late recognition in the Church, especially in the West, may be explained by the fact that it was written for or by [[Jewish Christians]], and therefore not widely circulated among the [[Pauline Christianity|Gentile Churches]].

Some scholars consider the letter a [[pseudonym]]ous work written between the end of the 1st century and the first quarter of the 2nd century because of its references to the [[apostles]]<ref>Jude: 17\u201318</ref> and to tradition<ref>Jude:3</ref> and because of its competent Greek style.<ref name=\"NAB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nab/bible/jude/jude.htm|title=scripture|publisher=}}</ref><ref>Norman Perrin, (1974) ''The New Testament: An Introduction'', p. 260</ref><ref>Bauckham, RJ (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.16</ref>\n\n\"More remarkable is the evidence that by the end of the second century Jude was widely accepted as canonical.\"<ref>Bauckham, RJ (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.17</ref> [[Clement of Alexandria]], [[Tertullian]], and the [[Muratorian fragment|Muratorian canon]] considered the letter canonical.

Not a lot is known of Jude, which would explain the apparent need to identify him by reference to his better-known brother.<ref name=\"NAB\"/>\n\nAs the brother of James the Just, it has traditionally meant Jude was also the brother of Jesus, since James is described as being the brother of Jesus. For instance [[Clement of Alexandria]] (c.&nbsp;150\u2013215 AD) wrote in his work ''\"Comments on the Epistle of Jude\"'' that Jude, the Epistle of Jude's author, was a son of Joseph and a brother of Jesus (without specifying whether he was a son of Joseph by a previous marriage or of Joseph and Mary).<ref>''\"Jude wrote the Catholic Epistle, the brother of the sons of Joseph, and very religious, while knowing the near relationship of the Lord, yet did not say that he himself was His brother. But what said he? \"Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ,\"\u2014 of Him as Lord; but \"the brother of James.\" For this is true; he was His brother, (the son) of Joseph.\"''{{cite book|last1=of Alexandria|first1=Clement|title=Comments on the Epistle of Jude.|website=newadvent.org|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0211.htm|accessdate=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a dispute as to whether \"brother\" means someone who has the same father and mother, or a half-brother or cousin or more distant familial relationship. This dispute over the true meaning of \"brother\" grew as the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|doctrine of the Virgin Birth]] evolved.<ref>Jocelyn Rhys, ''Shaken Creeds: The Virgin Birth Doctrine: A Study of Its Origin'', Kessinger Publishing (reprint), 2003 [1922] {{ISBN|0-7661-7988-5}}, pp 3\u201353</ref><ref>Chester, A and Martin, RP (1994), 'The Theology of the Letters of James, Peter and Jude', CUP, p.65</ref><ref>Bauckham, R. J. (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.14</ref>\n\nOutside the book of Jude, a \"Jude\" is mentioned five times in the New Testament: three times as [[Jude the Apostle]] (Luke 6:16, Acts 1:13, John 14:22), and twice as [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude the brother of Jesus]] (Matthew 13:55, Mark 6:3) (aside from references to [[Judas Iscariot]] and [[Judah (son of Jacob)]]). Debate continues as to whether the author of the epistle is either, both, or neither. Some scholars have argued that since the author of the letter has not identified himself as an apostle and actually refers to the apostles as a third party, he cannot be identified with Jude the Apostle. Others have drawn the opposite conclusion, i.e., that, as an apostle, he would not have made a claim of apostleship on his own behalf.<ref>Bauckham, R. J. (1986), [[Word Biblical Commentary]], Vol.50, Word (UK) Ltd. p.14f</ref>\n\n=== Style ===\nThe Epistle of Jude is a brief book of only a single chapter with 25 verses. It was composed as an ''[[encyclical]] letter''\u2014that is, one not directed to the members of one church in particular, but intended rather to be circulated and read in all churches.\n\nThe wording and syntax of this epistle in its original Greek demonstrates that the author was capable and fluent. The epistle is addressed to Christians in general,<ref>Jude 1:1</ref> and it warns them about the doctrine of certain errant teachers to whom they were exposed.\n\nThe epistle's style is combative, impassioned, and rushed. Many examples of evildoers and warnings about their fates are given in rapid succession.\n\nThe epistle concludes with a [[doxology]], which is considered by [[Peter H. Davids]] to be one of the highest in quality contained in the Bible.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Davids|first1=Peter H.|title=The Pillar New Testament Commentary: The Letters of 2 Peter and Jude|date=2006|publisher=Wm.

F. E. Gaebelein, Zondervan 1976\u20131992</ref>\n\nBecause this epistle is much shorter than 2 Peter, and due to various stylistic details, some writers consider Jude the source for the similar passages of 2 Peter.<ref>e.g. Terrance Callan, ''Use of the Letter of Jude by the Second Letter of Peter'', in ''Biblica'' 85 (2004), pp. 42\u201364.</ref> However, other writers, arguing that Jude 18 quotes 2 Peter 3:3 as past tense, consider Jude to have come after 2 Peter.<ref>e.g. John MacArthur ''1, 2, 3, John Jude'' 2007 p101 \"...closely parallels that of 2 Peter (2:1\u20133:4), and it is believed that Peter's writing predated Jude for several reasons: (1) Second Peter anticipates the coming of false teachers (2 Pet. 2:1\u20132; 3:3), whereas Jude deals with their arrival (vv. 4, 11\u201312, 17\u201318); and (2) Jude quotes directly from 2 Peter 3:3 and acknowledges that it is from an apostle (vv. 17\u201318).\"</ref>\n\nSome scholars who consider Jude to predate 2 Peter note that the latter appears to quote the former but omits the reference to the non-canonical book of Enoch.<ref>[[Dale Martin]] 2009 (lecture).

Most commentators assume that this indicates that Jude accepts the [[antediluvian]] patriarch [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] as the author of the [[Book of Enoch]] which contains the same quotation. However, an alternative explanation is that Jude quotes the Book of Enoch aware that verses 14\u201315 are in fact an expansion of the words of Moses from Deuteronomy 33:2.<ref>Charles R.

This means that the consecration is considered valid even if it flouts certain ecclesiastical laws, and even if the participants are [[Schism (religion)|schismatics]] or [[heresy|heretics]].\n\nAccording to a theological view affirmed, for instance, by the [[International Bishops' Conference]] of the [[Old Catholic Church]] with regard to ordinations by [[Arnold Mathew]], an episcopal ordination is for service within a specific Christian church, and an ordination ceremony that concerns only the individual himself does not make him truly a bishop.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rE3HEeoXJNsC&pg=PA197&dq=Smit+%22truly+bishops%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=npDrU8jTC4SR7AaIpIHQAQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Smit%20%22truly%20bishops%22&f=false Peter-Ben Smit, ''Old Catholic and Philippine Independent Ecclesiologies in History''] (BRILL 2011 {{ISBN|978-90-0420647-2}}), p. 197</ref> The [[Holy See]] has not commented on the validity of this theory, but has declared with regard to ordinations of this kind carried out, for example, by [[Emmanuel Milingo]], that the Church \"does not recognize and does not intend to recognize in the future those ordinations or any of the ordinations derived from them and therefore the canonical state of the alleged bishops remains that in which they were before the ordination conferred by Mr Milingo\".<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/aas/documents/2010/gennaio%202010.pdf ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' CII (2010), p. 58]</ref> Other theologians, notably those of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], dispute the notion that such ordinations have effect, a notion that opens up the possibility of valid but irregular consecrations proliferating outside the structures of the \"official\" denominations.\n\nA Catholic ordained to the episcopacy without a mandate from the Pope is automatically excommunicated<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1382] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080327064146/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P54.HTM |date=27 March 2008 }}</ref> and is thereby forbidden to celebrate the sacraments, according to canon law.<ref>[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4X.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 1331 \u00a71] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080329021837/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4X.HTM |date=29 March 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Eastern Orthodox===\nVlassios Pheidas, on an official [[Church of Greece]] site, uses the canonical language of the [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox tradition]], to describe the conditions in ecclesial [[praxis (Eastern Orthodoxy)|praxis]] when [[sacraments]], including [[Holy Orders]], are real, valid, and efficacious.

Yet, such a practice of economy does not overthrow the canonical \"acribeia\", which also remains in force and expresses the exclusive character of orthodox ecclesiology.\n\nThis observation is really important, because it reveals that the canonical recognition ({{lang|el|\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2}}) of the validity of sacraments performed outside the Orthodox Church: (a) is done by economy, (b) covers only specific cases in certain given instances, and (c) refers to the validity of the sacraments only of those who join the Orthodox Church, and not of the ecclesiastical bodies to which belong those who join the Orthodox Church. There is, [...] a variety of opinions or reservations concerning this question. No one, [...] could propose or support the view that the mutual recognition of the validity of sacraments among the Churches is an ecclesiastical act consistent with orthodox ecclesiology, or an act which is not rejected by the orthodox canonical tradition. [...]\n\n[...]\n\n[...] the mutual recognition of the validity of certain sacraments, [...] is for an Orthodox an act of inconsistency, when it is assessed with orthodox ecclesiological principles. These ecclesiological principles manifest in a strict fashion the organic unity of the orthodox ecclesial body and differentiate those who do not belong to its body as either schismatics or heretics.\n\nThe relation of schismatics or heretics to the body of the Orthodox Church is strictly defined by the canonical tradition. However, orthodox canonical tradition and praxis appraises and classifies these ecclesiastical bodies into various categories, [...] in which some form of ecclesiality is recognised. This type of ecclesiality is not easily determined, because the orthodox tradition [...] does not recognise the efficacy of the divine grace outside the canonical boundaries of the Orthodox Church.<ref name=\"Pheidas\" />{{rp|at=ch. 2}}}}\n\nThis applies to the validity and efficacy of the ordination of bishops and the other sacraments, not only of the [[Independent Catholic Churches]], but also of all other Christian churches, including the Roman Catholic Church, [[Oriental Orthodoxy]] and the [[Assyrian Church of the East]].\n\n===Anglican===\nAnglican bishop [[Colin Buchanan (bishop)|Colin Buchanan]], in the ''Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism'', says that the [[Anglican Communion]] has held an Augustinian view of orders, by which \"the validity of Episcopal ordinations (to whichever order) is based solely upon the historic succession in which the ordaining bishop stands, irrespective of their contemporary ecclesial context\".\nHe describes the circumstances of Archbishop [[Matthew Parker]]'s consecration as one of the reasons why this theory is \"generally held\".<ref name=\"Buchanan2006\">\n{{cite encyclopedia|location=Lanham, MD|publisher=The Scarecrow Press|series=Historical Dictionaries of Religions, Philosophies, and Movements|volume=62|encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of Anglicanism|year=2006|isbn=0810853272|last=Buchanan|first=Colin O|authorlink=Colin Buchanan (bishop)|title=Episcopus Vagans|pages=166&ndash;167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5Ig4SDJFgkC&lpg=PA166&vq=Episcopus%20Vagans&pg=PA166#v=snippet&q=Episcopus%20Vagans&f=false|accessdate={{date|2013-05-24}}}} {{cite encyclopedia|title=Old Catholics|page=335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5Ig4SDJFgkC&lpg=PA166&vq=Arnold%20Mathew&pg=PA335#v=onepage&q=Arnold%20Mathew&f=false|accessdate={{date|2013-05-24}}}}\n</ref> Parker was chosen by [[Queen regnant|Queen]] [[Elizabeth I of England]] to be the first [[Church of England]] [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] after the death of the previous office holder, [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Reginald Pole]], the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury.<ref name=\"Smith1907\">{{catholic|inline=1|volume=1|last=Smith|first=Sydney|wstitle=Anglican Orders|prescript=}}</ref> Buchanan notes the Roman Catholic Church also focuses on issues of intention and not just breaks in historical succession.<ref name=\"Buchanan2006\" /> He does not explain whether intention has an ecclesiological role, for Anglicans, in conferring or receiving sacraments.\n\n==History==\nAccording to Buchanan, \"the real rise of the problem\" happened in the 19th century, in the \"wake of the Anglo-Catholic movement\", \"through mischievous activities of a tiny number of independently acting bishops\".

She was the first woman to qualify in Britain as a physician and surgeon.<ref>[[James Barry (surgeon)|James Barry]], who lived as a man, qualified before her. [[Frances Hoggan]] preceded her as the first British woman to qualify in Europe, having qualified in Switzerland.</ref> She was the co-founder of the first hospital staffed by women, the first [[Dean (education)|dean]] of a British medical school, the first woman in Britain to be elected to a [[School board (England & Wales)|school board]] and, as Mayor of [[Aldeburgh]], the first female mayor and magistrate in Britain.<!--The lead needs a rewrite to focus on her achievements and less on \"first woman\".-->\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:My father and mother in their old age.jpg|thumb|Her parents, Newson and Louisa Garrett in their old age; from ''What I Remember'' by [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett]]]]\nGarrett was born in [[Whitechapel]], London, the second of eleven children of [[Newson Garrett]] (1812\u20131893), from [[Leiston]], [[Suffolk]], and his wife, Louisa (born Dunnell; {{circa}} 1813\u20131903), from London.<ref>Manton, p. 20</ref><ref name=Ogilvie />\n\nThe Garrett ancestors had been ironworkers in East Suffolk since the early seventeenth century.<ref>Manton, p. 17</ref> Newson was the youngest of three sons and not academically inclined, although he possessed the family's entrepreneurial spirit. When he finished school, the town of Leiston offered little to Newson, so he left for London to make his fortune. There, he fell  in love with his brother's sister-in-law, Louisa Dunnell, the daughter of an innkeeper of Suffolk origin. After their wedding, the couple went to live in a [[pawnbroker]]'s shop at 1 [[Commercial Road]], [[Whitechapel]]. The Garretts had their first three children in quick succession: Louie, Elizabeth and their brother (Dunnell Newson) who died at the age of six months. While Louisa grieved the loss of her third child, it was not easy to raise their two daughters in the city of London at that time.<ref>Manton, p. 22</ref> When Garrett was three years old, the family moved to 142 [[Long Acre]], where they lived for two years, whilst one more child was born and her father moved up in the world, becoming not only the manager of a larger pawnbroker's shop, but also a silversmith.<ref>Manton, p. 23</ref> Garrett's grandfather, owner of the family engineering works, [[Richard Garrett & Sons]], had died in 1837, leaving the business to his eldest son, Garrett's uncle. Despite his lack of capital, Newson was determined to be successful and in 1841, at the age of 29, he moved  his family  to Suffolk, where he bought a barley and coal merchants business in [[Snape, Suffolk|Snape]], constructing [[Snape Maltings]], a fine range of buildings for malting barley.<ref>Manton, p. 25</ref>\n\nThe Garretts lived in a square Georgian house opposite the church in [[Aldeburgh]] until 1852. Newson's malting business expanded and more children were born, Edmund (1840), Alice (1842), [[Agnes Garrett|Agnes]] (1845),<ref>{{cite book |title=Garrett, Agnes (1845\u20131935), interior designer and suffragist {{!}} Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-53628 |accessdate=11 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>  [[Millicent Garrett Fawcett|Millicent]] (1847), who was to become a leader in the constitutional campaign for women's suffrage, Sam (1850), Josephine (1853) and George (1854). By 1850, Newson was a prosperous businessman and was able to build Alde House, a mansion on a hill behind Aldeburgh. A \"by-product of the industrial revolution\",<ref>Manton, p. 28</ref> Garrett grew up in an atmosphere of \"triumphant economic pioneering\" and the Garrett children were to grow up to become achievers in the professional classes of late-Victorian England. Garrett was encouraged to take an interest in local politics and, contrary to practices at the time, was allowed the freedom to explore the town with its nearby salt-marshes, beach and the small port of [[Slaughden]] with its boatbuilders' yards and sailmakers' lofts.<ref>Manton, pp. 28\u201332</ref>\n\n== Early education ==\nThere was no school in Aldeburgh so Garrett learned [[the three Rs]] from her mother. When she was 10 years old, a governess, Miss Edgeworth, a poor gentlewoman, was employed to educate Garrett and her sister. Mornings were spent in the schoolroom; there were regimented afternoon walks; educating the young ladies continued at mealtimes when Edgeworth ate with the family; at night, the governess slept in a curtained off area in the girls' bedroom. Garrett despised her governess and sought to outwit the teacher in the classroom.<ref>Manton, pp. 32\u201333</ref> When Garrett was 13 and her sister 15, they were sent to a private school, the Boarding School for Ladies in Blackheath, London, which was run by the step aunts of the poet [[Robert Browning]].<ref>Manton, p. 33</ref>  There, English literature, French, Italian and German as well as deportment, were taught.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Women in Science: Antiquity Through the Nineteenth Century: a Biographical Dictionary with Annotated Bibliography|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn B|publisher=MIT Press|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Eganderson.jpg|thumb|left|A portrait of Garrett in the 1860s]]\nLater in life, Garrett recalled the stupidity of her teachers there, though her schooling there did help establish a love of reading.<ref>Manton, pp. 35-36</ref> Her main complaint about the school was the lack of science and mathematics instruction.<ref name=Ogilvie /> Her reading matter included [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], [[Wordsworth]], Milton, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Trollope]], [[Thackeray]] and [[George Eliot]]. Elizabeth and Louie were known as \"the bathing Garretts\", as their father had insisted they be allowed a hot bath once a week.<ref>Manton, pp. 35\u201336</ref>  However, they made what were to be lifelong friends there. When they finished in 1851, they were sent on a short tour abroad, ending with a memorable visit to the [[Great Exhibition]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London.<ref name=Ogilvie />\n\nAfter this formal education, Garrett spent the next nine years tending to domestic duties, but she continued to study Latin and arithmetic in the mornings and also read widely. Her sister Millicent recalled Garrett's weekly lectures, \"Talks on Things in General\", when her younger siblings would gather while she discussed politics and current affairs from [[Garibaldi]] to [[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second|Macaulay's ''History of England'']].<ref>Manton, p. 44</ref> In 1854, when she was eighteen, Garrett and her sister went on a long visit to their school friends, Jane and Anne Crow, in [[Gateshead]] where she met [[Emily Davies]], the early feminist and future co-founder of [[Girton College]], Cambridge. Davies was to be a lifelong friend and confidante, always ready to give sound advice during the important decisions of Garrett's career. It may have been in the ''[[English Woman's Journal]]'', first issued in 1858, that Garrett first read of [[Elizabeth Blackwell]], who had become the first female doctor in the United States in 1849.<ref name=Ogilvie /> When Blackwell visited London in 1859, Garrett travelled to the capital. By then, her sister Louie was married and living in London. Garrett joined the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]], which organised Blackwell's lectures on \"Medicine as a Profession for Ladies\" and set up a private meeting between Garrett and the doctor.<ref>Manton, pp. 50\u201352</ref> It is said that during a visit to Alde House around 1860, one evening while sitting by the fireside, Garrett and Davies selected careers for advancing the frontiers of women's rights; Garrett was to open the medical profession to women, Davies the doors to a university education for women, while 13-year-old Millicent was allocated politics and votes for women.<ref>Manton, p. 72</ref>  At first Newson was opposed to the radical idea of his daughter becoming a physician but came round and agreed to do all in his power, both financially and otherwise, to support Garrett.<ref>Manton, pp. 73\u201376</ref>\n\n== Medical education ==\n\nAfter an initial unsuccessful visit to leading doctors in [[Harley Street]], Garrett decided to first spend six months as a surgery nurse at [[Middlesex Hospital]], London in August 1860.<ref name=Ogilvie /><ref>Manton, pp. 82\u201393</ref> On proving to be a good nurse, she was allowed to attend an outpatients' clinic, then her first operation. She unsuccessfully attempted to enroll in the hospital's Medical School but was allowed to attend private tuition in Latin, Greek and ''[[materia medica]]'' with the hospital's apothecary, while continuing her work as a nurse. She also employed a tutor to study anatomy and physiology three evenings a week. Eventually she was allowed into the dissecting room and the chemistry lectures. Gradually, Garrett became an unwelcome presence among the male students, who in 1861 presented a memorial to the school against her admittance as a fellow student, despite the support she enjoyed from the administration.<ref name=Ogilvie /><ref>Manton, pp. 104\u2013110</ref> She was obliged to leave the Middlesex Hospital but she did so with an honours certificate in chemistry and ''materia medica''. Garrett then applied to several medical schools, including Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow, Edinburgh, [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and the [[Royal College of Surgeons]], all of which refused her admittance.<ref name=Ogilvie /><ref>Manton, pp. 114\u2013115</ref>\n\nA companion to her in this struggle was the lesser known [[Sophia Jex-Blake|Dr Sophia Jex-Blake]]. Whilst both are considered \"outstanding\" medical figures of the late 19th century, Garrett was able to obtain her credentials by way of a \"side door\" through a loophole in admissions at the [[Worshipful Society of Apothecaries]].<ref name=\"jstor.org\">{{cite journal|last1=Annie G.|first1=Porritt|title=Reviewed Work: The Life of Sophia Jex-Blake. by Margaret Todd|journal=Political Science Quarterly|date=1919|volume=34|issue=1|page=180|jstor=2141537}}</ref> Having privately obtained a certificate in anatomy and physiology, she was admitted in 1862 by the Society of Apothecaries who, as a condition of their charter, could not legally exclude her on account of her sex.<ref name=\"jstor.org\" /> She continued her battle to qualify by studying privately with various professors, including some at the University of St Andrews, the [[Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion|Edinburgh Royal Maternity]] and the [[London Hospital Medical School]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn 1865, she finally took her exam and obtained a licence (LSA) from the Society of Apothecaries to practise medicine, the first woman qualified in Britain to do so openly (previously there was Dr [[James Barry (surgeon)|James Barry]] who was born and raised female but presented as male from the age of 20 in order to go to medical school, and lived his adult life as a man). On the day, three out of seven candidates passed the exam, Garrett with the highest marks.<ref>Manton, pp. 162\u2013163</ref>  The Society of Apothecaries immediately amended its regulations to prevent other women obtaining a licence <ref>Manton, p. 176</ref> meaning that Jex-Blake however could not follow this same path; the new rule disallowed privately educated women to be eligible for examination.<ref name=\"jstor.org\" /> It was not until 1876 that the new [[UK Medical Act of 1876|Medical Act]] (39 and 40 Vict, Ch. 41) passed which allowed British medical authorities to license all qualified applicants whatever their gender.<ref>{{cite book|title=British Medical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Rw-AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA1079|year=1908|publisher=British Medical Association|pages=1079\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Ph.D.2014\">{{cite book|author=John A.

So in late 1865, Garrett opened her own practice at 20 Upper [[Berkeley Street]], London.<ref>Manton, pp. 167\u2013169</ref> At first patients were scarce, but the practice gradually grew. After six months in practice, she wished to open an [[Outpatient clinic (hospital department)|outpatients]] [[dispensary]], to enable poor women to obtain medical help from a qualified practitioner of their own gender. [[1863\u201375 cholera pandemic|In 1865, there was an outbreak of cholera]] in Britain, affecting both rich and poor, and in their panic, some people forgot any prejudices they had in relation to a female physician. The first death due to cholera occurred in 1866, but by then Garrett had already opened St Mary's Dispensary for Women and Children, at 69 Seymour Place.<ref>Manton, p. 173</ref> In the first year, she tended to 3,000 new patients, who made 9,300 outpatient visits to the dispensary.<ref>Manton, p. 175</ref>  On hearing that the Dean of the faculty of medicine at the [[University of Sorbonne]], Paris was in favour of admitting women as medical students, Garrett studied French so that she could apply for a medical degree, which she obtained in 1870 after some difficulty.<ref name=Ogilvie /><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/brecon_life/pages/franceshoggan.shtml Pioneering Physician], BBC, Last updated: 2 January 2008</ref>\n\n[[File:Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, M.D.jpg|thumb|left|Caricature of Garrett Anderson published in 1872]]\nThe same year she was elected to the first [[London School Board]], an office newly opened to women; Garrett's was the highest vote among all the candidates. Also in that year, she was made one of the visiting physicians of the East London Hospital for Children (later the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children]]), becoming the first woman in Britain to be appointed to a medical post,<ref>Manton, pp. 193\u2013195</ref> but she found the duties of these two positions to be incompatible with her principal work in her private practice and the dispensary, as well as her role as a new mother, so she resigned from these posts by 1873.<ref>Manton, p. 235</ref> In 1872, the dispensary became the [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson and Obstetric Hospital|New Hospital for Women and Children]], treating women from all over London for gynaecological conditions; the hospital moved to new premises in Marylebone Street in 1874. Around this time, Garrett also entered into discussion with male medical views regarding women. In 1874, [[Henry Maudsley]]\u2019s article on Sex and Mind in Education appeared, which argued that education for women caused over-exertion and thus reduced their reproductive capacity, sometimes causing \u201cnervous and even mental disorders\u201d.<ref>Manton, p. 236</ref> Garrett's counter-argument was that the real danger for women was not education but boredom and that fresh air and exercise were preferable to sitting by the fire with a novel.<ref>Manton, p. 237</ref>  In the same year, she co-founded London School of Medicine for Women with [[Sophia Jex-Blake]] and  became a lecturer in what was the only teaching hospital in Britain to offer courses for women.<ref>Manton, pp. 241\u2013243</ref> She continued to work there for the rest of her career and was dean of the school from 1883 to 1902. This school was later called the Royal Free Hospital of Medicine,<ref>Manton, p. 308</ref> which later became part of what is now the medical school of [[University College London]].\n\n=== BMA membership ===\n[[File:Elizabeth Garrett Anderson.jpg|thumb|Garrett Anderson circa 1889]]\n[[File:Lady mayoress.jpg|left|thumb|Garrett Anderson as mayor of [[Aldeburgh]], November 1908]]\nIn 1873 she gained membership of the [[British Medical Association]] (BMA).

The erosion is both [[Downcutting|downward]], deepening the [[valley]], and [[headward erosion|headward]], extending the valley into the hillside, creating [[Head Cut (stream geomorphology)|head cuts]] and steep banks. In the earliest stage of stream erosion, the erosive activity is dominantly vertical, the valleys have a typical '''V''' cross-section and the stream gradient is relatively steep. When some [[base level]] is reached, the erosive activity switches to lateral erosion, which widens the valley floor and creates a narrow floodplain. The stream gradient becomes nearly flat, and lateral deposition of sediments becomes important as the stream [[meander]]s across the valley floor. In all stages of stream erosion, by far the most erosion occurs during times of flood when more and faster-moving water is available to carry a larger sediment load. In such processes, it is not the water alone that erodes: suspended abrasive particles, [[pebble]]s, and [[boulder]]s can also act erosively as they traverse a surface, in a process known as ''traction''.<ref>Ritter, Michael E.

Another significant source of erosion, particularly on carbonate coastlines, is boring, scraping and grinding of organisms, a process termed ''[[bioerosion]]''.<ref>Glynn, Peter W. \"Bioerosion and coral-reef growth: a dynamic balance.\" Life and death of coral reefs (1997): 68-95.</ref>\n\n[[Sediment]] is transported along the coast in the direction of the prevailing current ([[longshore drift]]). When the upcurrent amount of sediment is less than the amount being carried away, erosion occurs. When the upcurrent amount of sediment is greater, sand or gravel banks will tend to form as a result of [[deposition (geology)|deposition]]. These banks may slowly migrate along the coast in the direction of the longshore drift, alternately protecting and exposing parts of the coastline. Where there is a bend in the coastline, quite often a buildup of eroded material occurs forming a long narrow bank (a [[spit (landform)|spit]]). [[Armor (hydrology)|Armoured]] beaches and submerged offshore [[shoal|sandbanks]] may also protect parts of a coastline from erosion. Over the years, as the shoals gradually shift, the erosion may be redirected to attack different parts of the shore.<ref>Bell, Frederic Gladstone. \u201cMarine action and control.\u201d Geological hazards: their assessment, avoidance, and mitigation, Taylor & Francis, 1999, pp. 302\u2013306.</ref>\n\n===Chemical erosion===\n<!--why is chemical erosion listed here as a physical (mechanical) process?-->\nChemical erosion is the loss of matter in a landscape in the form of [[solution|solute]]s.

In an abrasion process, debris in the basal ice scrapes along the bed, polishing and gouging the underlying rocks, similar to sandpaper on wood. Scientists have shown that, in addition to the role of temperature played in valley-deepening, other glaciological processes, such as erosion also control cross-valley variations.  In a homogeneous bedrock erosion pattern, curved channel cross-section beneath the ice is created. Though the glacier continues to incise vertically, the shape of the channel beneath the ice eventually remain constant, reaching a U-shaped parabolic steady-state shape as we now see in glaciated valleys. Scientists also provide a numerical estimate of the time required for the ultimate formation of a steady-shaped [[U-shaped valley]] - approximately 100,000 years. In a weak bedrock (containing material more erodible than the surrounding rocks) erosion pattern, on the contrary, the amount of over deepening is limited because ice velocities and erosion rates are reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harbor|first=Jonathan M.|last2=Hallet|first2=Bernard|last3=Raymond|first3=Charles F.|date=1988-05-26|title=A numerical model of landform development by glacial erosion|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v333/n6171/abs/333347a0.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=333|issue=6171|pages=347\u2013349|doi=10.1038/333347a0|bibcode=1988Natur.333..347H}}</ref>\n\nGlaciers can also cause pieces of bedrock to crack off in the process of plucking. In ice thrusting, the glacier freezes to its bed, then as it surges forward, it moves large sheets of frozen sediment at the base along with the glacier. This method produced some of the many thousands of lake basins that dot the edge of the [[Canadian Shield]]. Differences in the height of mountain ranges are not only being the result tectonic forces, such as rock uplift, but also local climate variations.

The relationship is particularly strong if heavy rainfall occurs at times when, or in locations where, the soil's surface is not well protected by [[vegetation]]. This might be during periods when [[agriculture|agricultural activities]] leave the soil bare, or in [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] regions where vegetation is naturally sparse. Wind erosion requires strong winds, particularly during times of drought when vegetation is sparse and soil is dry (and so is more erodible). Other climatic factors such as average temperature and temperature range may also affect erosion, via their effects on vegetation and soil properties. In general, given similar vegetation and ecosystems, areas with more precipitation (especially high-intensity rainfall), more wind, or more storms are expected to have more erosion.\n\nIn some areas of the world (e.g. the [[Midwestern United States|mid-western USA]]), rainfall intensity is the primary determinant of erosivity (for a definition of ''erosivity'' check,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Natural Hazards|last=Zorn|first=Matija|last2=Komac|first2=Bla\u017e|date=2013-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9789048186990|editor-last=Bobrowsky|editor-first=Peter T.|series=Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series|pages=289\u2013290|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4399-4_121}}</ref>) with higher intensity rainfall generally resulting in more soil erosion by water.

Geometric constructions were also used to define [[rational number]]s as ratios of [[commensurability (mathematics)|commensurable lengths]]. When [[algebra]] and [[mathematical analysis]] became developed enough, this relation reversed and now it is more common to define Euclidean spaces from [[vector space]]s, which allows using [[Cartesian coordinates]] and the power of [[algebra]] and [[calculus]]. This means that [[point (geometry)|points]] are specified with [[tuple]]s of [[real number]]s, called [[coordinate vector]]s, and [[geometric shape]]s are defined by [[equation]]s and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] relating these coordinates. This approach has also the advantage of allowing easily the generalization of geometry to Euclidean spaces of more than three dimensions.\n\nFrom the modern viewpoint, there is essentially only one Euclidean space of each dimension. While Euclidean space is defined by a set of axioms, these axioms do not specify how the points are to be represented.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gabi|first1=Aalex|title=What is the difference between Euclidean and Cartesian spaces?|url=https://math.stackexchange.com/q/112076|website=Mathematics Stack Exchange|publisher=Mathematics Stack Exchange}}</ref> Euclidean space can, as one possible choice of representation, be modeled using Cartesian coordinates.

Solomentsev|date=7 February 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n===History===\nEuclidean space were introduced by [[Greek mathematics|ancient Greeks]] as an abstraction of our physical space. Their great innovation, appearing in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']] was to built and ''[[proof (mathematics)|prove]]'' all geometry by starting from a few very basic properties, which are abstracted from the physical world, and are too basic for being mathematically proved. These properties are called [[postulate]]s, or [[axiom]]s in modern language. This way of defining Euclidean space is still in use under the name of [[synthetic geometry]].\n\nIn 1637, [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] introduced [[Cartesian coordinates]] and showed that this allows reducing geometric problem to algebraic computations with numbers. This reduction of geometry to [[algebra]] was a major change of point of view, as, until then, the [[real number]]s\u2014that is, [[rational number]]s and non-rational numbers together\u2013were defined in terms of geometry, as lengths and distance. \n\nDespite the wide use of Descartes approaches, which was called [[analytic geometry]], the definition of Euclidean space remained unchanged until the end of 19th century. The introduction of abstract [[vector space]]s allowed to use them for defining Euclidean spaces, with a purely algebraic definition. This new definition has been shown to be equivalent to the classical definition in terms of geometrical axioms. Now, this is this algebraic definition that is more often used for introducing Euclidean spaces.\n\n===Intuitive overview===\nOne way to think of the Euclidean plane is as a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of [[point (geometry)|point]]s satisfying certain relationships, expressible in terms of distance and angle. For example, there are two fundamental operations (referred to as [[motion (geometry)|motions]]) on the plane. One is [[translation (geometry)|translation]], which means a shifting of the plane so that every point is shifted in the same direction and by the same distance. The other is [[rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] about a fixed point in the plane, in which every point in the plane turns about that fixed point through the same angle. One of the basic tenets of Euclidean geometry is that two figures (usually<!-- not always --> considered as [[subset]]s) of the plane should be considered equivalent ([[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]) if one can be transformed into the other by some sequence of translations, rotations and [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s (see [[#Euclidean group|below]]).\n\nIn order to make all of this mathematically {{visible anchor|precise}}, the theory must clearly define the notions of distance, angle, translation, and rotation for a mathematically described space. Even when used in [[physics|physical]] theories, Euclidean space is an [[abstraction]] detached from actual physical locations, specific [[frame of reference|reference frames]], measurement instruments, and so on. A purely mathematical definition of Euclidean space also ignores questions of [[unit of length|units of length]] and other [[dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]]: the distance in a \"mathematical\" space is a [[number]], not something expressed in inches or metres. The standard way to define such space, as carried out in the remainder of this article, is to define the Euclidean plane as a two-dimensional [[real number|real]] [[vector space]] equipped with an [[inner product space|inner product]].<ref name=\"mathen\"/> The reason for working with arbitrary vector spaces instead of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is that it is often preferable to work in a ''coordinate-free'' manner (that is, without choosing a preferred basis). For then:\n*the [[coordinate vector|vector]]s in the vector space correspond to the points of the Euclidean plane,\n*the [[addition]] operation in the vector space corresponds to [[translation (geometry)|translation]], and\n*the inner product implies notions of angle and distance, which can be used to define rotation.\nOnce the Euclidean plane has been described in this language, it is actually a simple matter to extend its concept to arbitrary dimensions. For the most part, the vocabulary, formulae, and calculations are not made any more difficult by the presence of more dimensions. (However, rotations are more subtle in high dimensions, and visualizing [[high-dimensional space]]s remains difficult, even for experienced mathematicians.)\n\nA Euclidean space is not technically a [[vector space]] but rather an [[affine space]], on which a vector space [[group action|acts]] by translations, or, conversely, a [[Euclidean vector]] is the [[subtraction|difference]] ([[displacement (vector)|displacement]]) in an ordered pair of points, not a single point. Intuitively, the distinction says merely that there is no [[canonical form|canonical]] choice of where the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] should go in the space, because it can be translated anywhere. When a certain point is chosen, it can be declared the origin and subsequent calculations may ignore the difference between a point and its coordinate vector, as said above. See [[point\u2013vector distinction]] for details.\n\n===Technical definition===\n{{expand section|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Euclidean structure==\nThese are distances between points and the angles between lines or vectors, which satisfy certain conditions (see [[#conditions|below]]), which makes a set of points a Euclidean space. The natural way to obtain these quantities is by introducing and using the standard inner product (also known as the [[dot product]]) on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.<ref name=\"mathen\"/> The inner product of any two real {{mvar|n}}-vectors {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''y'''}} is defined by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{y} = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i = x_1y_1+x_2y_2+\\cdots+x_ny_n,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|x<sub>i</sub>}} and {{mvar|y<sub>i</sub>}} are {{mvar|i}}th coordinates of vectors {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''y'''}} respectively.\nThe result is always a real number.\n\n=== Distance ===\n{{main article|Euclidean distance}}\nThe inner product [[square (algebra)|of {{math|'''x'''}} with itself]] is always [[non-negative]]. This product allows us to define the \"length\" of a vector {{math|'''x'''}} through [[square root]]:\n\n:<math>\\|\\mathbf{x}\\| = \\sqrt{\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{x}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^2}.</math>\n\nThis length function satisfies the required properties of a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] and is called the '''Euclidean norm''' on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}.\n\nFinally, one can use the norm to define a [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] (or distance function) on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} by\n\n:<math>d(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{y}) = \\|\\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{y}\\| = \\sqrt{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}.</math>\n\nThis distance function is called the [[Euclidean distance|Euclidean metric]]. This formula expresses a special case of the [[Pythagorean theorem]].\n\nThis distance function (which makes a [[metric space]]) is sufficient to define all Euclidean geometry, including the dot product<!-- can be recovered from it through the [[cosine law]]-->. Thus, a real coordinate space together with this Euclidean structure is called '''Euclidean space'''. Its vectors form an [[inner product space]] (in fact a [[Hilbert space]]), and a [[normed vector space]].\n\nThe metric space structure is the main reason behind the use of [[real number]]s {{math|'''R'''}}, not some other [[ordered field]], as the mathematical foundation of Euclidean (and many other) spaces. Euclidean space is a [[complete metric space]]<!-- explain -->, a property which is impossible to achieve operating over [[rational number]]s, for example.\n\n=== Angle ===\n{{main article|Angle}}\n[[Image:45, -315, and 405 co-terminal angles.svg|thumb|right|Positive and negative angles on the oriented plane]]\nThe ('''non-reflex''') '''angle''' {{mvar|\u03b8}} ({{math|0\u00b0 \u2264 ''\u03b8'' \u2264 180\u00b0}}) between vectors {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''y'''}} is then given by\n:<math>\\theta = \\arccos\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{x}\\cdot\\mathbf{y}}{\\|\\mathbf{x}\\|\\|\\mathbf{y}\\|}\\right)</math>\nwhere {{math|arccos}} is the [[arccosine]] function.

Namely, on an [[orientation (vector space)|oriented]] Euclidean plane one can define an angle between two vectors as a number defined [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] [[turn (geometry)|1 turn]] (usually denoted as either {{math|2[[pi|\u03c0]]}} or 360\u00b0), such that {{math|1=\u2220'''y'''\u2009'''x''' = \u2212\u2220'''x'''\u2009'''y'''}}. This oriented angle is equal either to the angle {{mvar|\u03b8}} from the formula above or to {{math|\u2212''\u03b8''}}. If one non-zero vector is fixed (such as the first basis vector), then each non-zero vector is uniquely defined by its magnitude and angle.\n\nThe angle does not change if vectors {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''y'''}} are [[scalar multiplication|multiplied by positive numbers]].\n<!-- distance on (''n'' \u2212 1) -sphere -->\n\nUnlike the [[#precise|aforementioned situation]] with distance, the scale of angles is the same in pure mathematics, physics, and computing. It does not depend on the scale of distances; all distances may be multiplied by some fixed factor, and all angles will be preserved. Usually, the angle is considered a [[dimensionless quantity]], but there are different units of measurement, such as [[radian]] (preferred in pure mathematics and theoretical physics) and [[degree (angle)|degree]] (\u00b0) (preferred in most applications).\n\n=== Rotations and reflections ===\n{{main article|Rotation (mathematics)|Reflection (mathematics)|Orthogonal group}}\n{{see also|rotational symmetry|reflection symmetry}}\nSymmetries of a Euclidean space are transformations which preserve the Euclidean metric (called ''[[isometry|isometries]]''). Although [[#Intuitive overview|aforementioned translations]] are most obvious of them, they have the same structure for any affine space and do not show a distinctive character of Euclidean geometry. Another family of symmetries leave one point fixed, which may be seen as the origin without loss of generality. All transformations, which preserves the origin and the Euclidean metric, are [[linear map]]s.<!-- one can, by induction, prove that \u211d\u00b9 can be isometrically embedded only as a line, \u211d\u00b2 \u2014 as a plane, and so on, but should the article explain it? --> Such transformations {{mvar|Q}} must, for any {{math|'''x'''}} and {{math|'''y'''}}, satisfy:\n:<math>Q\\mathbf{x} \\cdot Q\\mathbf{y} = \\mathbf{x} \\cdot \\mathbf{y}</math>\u2003([[real coordinate space#Matrix notation|explain the notation]]),\n:<math>|Q\\mathbf{x}| = |\\mathbf{x}|.</math>\n\nSuch transforms constitute a [[group (mathematics)|group]] called the ''[[orthogonal group]]'' {{math|O(''n'')}}.

Only transformations which preserve orientation, which form the ''special orthogonal'' group {{math|SO(''n'')}}, are considered (proper) [[rotation (mathematics)|rotations]].

There are no non-trivial rotations in 0- and 1-spaces. Rotations of a Euclidean plane ({{math|1=''n'' = 2}}) are parametrized by the [[#Angle|angle (modulo 1 turn)]]. Rotations of a 3-space are parametrized with [[axis\u2013angle representation|axis and angle]], whereas a rotation of a 4-space is a [[function composition|superposition]] of two 2-dimensional rotations around perpendicular planes.\n\nAmong linear transforms in {{math|O(''n'')}} which reverse the orientation are [[reflection (mathematics)|hyperplane reflections]]. This is the only possible case for {{math|''n'' \u2264 2}}, but starting from three dimensions, such isometry in the [[general position]] is a [[rotoreflection]].\n\n=== Euclidean group ===\n{{main article|Euclidean group}}\nThe Euclidean [[group (mathematics)|group]] {{math|''E''(''n'')}}, also referred to as the group of all [[isometry|isometries]] {{math|ISO(''n'')}}, treats [[translation (geometry)|translations]], rotations, and reflections in a uniform way, considering them as [[group action]]s in the context of [[group theory]], and especially in [[Lie group]] theory.  These group actions preserve the Euclidean structure.\n\nAs the group of all isometries, {{math|ISO(''n'')}}, the Euclidean group is important because it makes Euclidean geometry a case of [[Klein geometry]], a theoretical framework including many [[#Alternatives and generalizations|alternative geometries]].\n\nThe structure of Euclidean spaces \u2013 distances, lines, vectors, angles ([[up to]] sign), and so on \u2013 is [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under the transformations of their associated Euclidean group. For instance, translations form a [[abelian group|commutative]] [[subgroup]] that [[transitive action|acts freely and transitively]] on {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, while the [[stabilizer (group theory)|stabilizer]] of any point there is the [[#Rotations and reflections|aforementioned {{math|O(''n'')}}]].\n\nAlong with translations, rotations, reflections, as well as the [[identity transformation]], Euclidean motions comprise also [[glide reflection]]s (for {{math|''n'' \u2265 2}}), [[screw axis|screw operations]] and rotoreflections (for {{math|''n'' \u2265 3}}), and even more complex combinations of primitive transformations for {{math|''n'' \u2265 4}}.\n\n{{anchor|conditions}}The group structure determines which conditions a [[metric space]] needs to satisfy to be a Euclidean space:\n\n# Firstly, a metric space must be translationally invariant with respect to some (finite-dimensional) real vector space. This means that the space itself is an [[affine space]], that the space is ''flat'', not [[curved space|curved]], and points do not have different properties, and so any point can be translated to any other point.\n# Secondly, the metric must correspond [[#Distance|in the aforementioned way]] to some positive-defined [[quadratic form]] on this vector space, because point stabilizers have to be isomorphic to {{math|O(''n'')}}. <!-- this still needs some clarification, because a Euclidean metric whose values are deformed by a convex function is not a Euclidean space, although has the same isometries group -->\n\n== Non-Cartesian coordinates ==\n[[Image:Repere espace.png|thumb|right|192px|3-dimensional skew coordinates]]\n{{main article|Coordinate system}}\n\nCartesian coordinates are arguably the standard, but not the only possible option for a Euclidean space.\n[[Affine coordinates]] and [[Barycentric coordinate system|barycentric coordinates]] are compatible with the affine structure of {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}, but make formulae for angles and distances more complicated.\n\nAnother approach, which goes in line with ideas of [[differential geometry]] and [[conformal geometry]], is [[orthogonal coordinates]], where [[coordinate hypersurface]]s of different coordinates are [[orthogonal]], although [[curvilinear coordinates|curved]]. Examples include the [[polar coordinate system]] on Euclidean plane, the second important plane coordinate system.\n\nSee [[#Curved spaces|below]] about expression of the Euclidean structure in curvilinear coordinates.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Geometric shapes ==\n[[Image:Parabolic coords.svg|thumb|240px|[[Parabolic coordinates]]]]\n[[Image:Quadray.gif|thumb|right|192px|<span style=\"font-size:90%\">[[Barycentric coordinates (mathematics)|Barycentric coordinates]] in 3-dimensional space: four coordinates are related with one [[linear equation]]</span>]]\n{| align=right style=\"clear:left; margin-top:-8px\"\n | style=\"font-size:80%\" |Polar<br>coordi-<br>nates:<br>see<br>[[#Angle|Angle]]<br>above\n |[[Image:Polar concept introduction.svg|160px]]\n |}\n[[Image:Linear subspaces with shading.svg|thumb|right|Three mutually [[transversality (mathematics)|transversal]] planes in the 3-dimensional space and their intersections, three lines]]\n{{see also|List of mathematical shapes}}\n\n=== Lines, planes, and other subspaces ===\n{{main article|Flat (geometry)}}\nThe simplest (after points) objects in Euclidean space are [[flat (geometry)|flats]], or Euclidean ''subspaces'' of lesser dimension. Points are 0-dimensional flats, 1-dimensional flats are called ''[[line (geometry)|(straight) lines]]'', and 2-dimensional flats are ''[[plane (geometry)|planes]]''. {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-dimensional flats are called ''[[hyperplane]]s''.\n\nAny two distinct points lie on exactly one line. Any line and a point outside it lie on exactly one plane. More generally, the properties of flats and their [[incidence (geometry)|incidence]] of Euclidean space are shared with [[affine geometry]], whereas the affine geometry is devoid of distances and angles.\n\n=== Line segments and triangles ===\n{| align=right width=288px style=\"margin-left:1em\"\n | style=\"font-size:87%\" |[[Image:Triangle angles sum to 180 degrees.svg|thumb|left|145px]]\nThe [[sum of angles of a triangle]] is an important problem, which exerted a great influence to 19th-century mathematics. In a Euclidean space it invariably equals to 180[[degree (angle)|\u00b0]], or a half-turn\n |}\n{{main article|Line segment|Triangle geometry}}\nThis is not only a line which a pair {{math|(''A'',\u2009''B'')}} of distinct points defines. Points on the line which lie between {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}, together with {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}} themselves, constitute a [[line segment]] {{math|''A''\u2009''B''}}. Any line segment has the [[length]], which equals to distance between {{mvar|A}} and {{mvar|B}}. If {{math|1=''A'' = ''B''}}, then the segment is [[degeneracy (mathematics)|degenerate]] and its length equals to 0, otherwise the length is positive.\n\nA (non-degenerate) [[triangle]] is defined by [[3 (number)|three]] points not lying on the same line. Any triangle lies on one plane. The concept of triangle is not specific to Euclidean spaces, but Euclidean triangles have numerous special properties<!--, such as [[triangle inequality]]--> and define many derived objects.\n\nA triangle can be thought of as a 3-gon on a plane, a special (and the first meaningful in Euclidean geometry) case of a [[polygon]].\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Polytopes and root systems ===\n{| align=right class=wikitable width=260px\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"| The [[Platonic solid]]s are the five polyhedra that are most regular in a combinatoric sense, but also, their symmetry groups are embedded into {{math|O(3)}}<br>{{further|point groups in three dimensions}}\n|-  style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: center;\"\n|[[File:Polyhedron pair 4-4.png|128px]]<br>Pair of dual [[tetrahedron|tetrahedra]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron pair 6-8.png|128px]]<br>[[Cube]] and [[octahedron]]\n|[[File:Polyhedron pair 12-20 max.png|128px]]<br>[[regular dodecahedron|Dodecahedron]] and [[regular icosahedron|icosahedron]]\n|}\n{{main article|Polytope|Root system}}\n{{see also|List of polygons, polyhedra and polytopes|List of regular polytopes}}\nPolytope is a concept that generalizes [[polygon]]s on a plane and [[polyhedra]] in 3-dimensional space (which are among the earliest studied geometrical objects). A [[simplex]] is a generalization of a line segment (1-simplex) and a triangle (2-simplex). A [[tetrahedron]] is a 3-simplex.\n\nThe concept of a polytope belongs to [[affine geometry]], which is more general than Euclidean. But Euclidean geometry distinguish ''[[regular polytope]]s''. For example, affine geometry does not see the difference between an [[equilateral triangle]] and a [[right triangle]], but in Euclidean space the former is regular and the latter is not.\n\nRoot systems are special sets of Euclidean vectors. A root system is often identical to the set of vertices of a regular polytope.\n\n{| class=wikitable width=320\n|- valign=top\n|[[Image:Root system G2.svg|160px]]<br>The root system [[G2 (mathematics)|G<sub>2</sub>]]\n|[[Image:Up2 2 31 t0 E7.svg|160px]]<br>An orthogonal projection of the [[2 31 polytope|2<sub>31</sub> polytope]], whose vertices are elements of the [[E7 (mathematics)|E<sub>7</sub>]] root system\n|}\n\n=== Curves ===\n{{main article|Euclidean geometry of curves}}\n{{see also|List of curves}}\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n\n=== Balls, spheres, and hypersurfaces ===\n{{main article|Ball (mathematics)|Hypersurface}}\n{{see also|n-sphere|List of surfaces}}\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n\n==Topology==\n{{main article|Real coordinate space #Topological properties}}\nSince Euclidean space is a [[metric space]], it is also a [[topological space]] with the [[natural topology]] induced by the metric. The metric topology on {{math|'''E'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is called the '''Euclidean topology''', and it is identical to the [[standard topology]] on {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}}. A set is [[open set|open]] [[if and only if]] it contains an [[open ball]] around each of its points; in other words, open balls form a [[base (topology)|base of the topology]]. The [[topological dimension]] of the Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space equals {{mvar|n}}, which implies that spaces of different dimension are not [[homeomorphic]]. A finer result is the [[invariance of domain]], which proves that any subset of {{mvar|n}}-space, that is (with its [[subspace topology]]) homeomorphic to an open subset of {{mvar|n}}-space, is itself open.\n\n==Applications==\nAside from countless uses in fundamental mathematics, a Euclidean model of the physical [[space]] can be used to solve many practical problems with sufficient precision. Two usual approaches are a fixed, or ''stationary'' [[frame of reference|reference frame]] (i.e. the description of a [[motion (physics)|motion of objects]] as their [[position (vector)|positions]] that [[continuous function|change continuously]] with [[time]]), and {{anchor|Galilean}}the use of [[Galilean relativity|Galilean space-time symmetry]] (such as in [[Newtonian mechanics]]). To both of them the modern Euclidean geometry provides a convenient formalism; for example, the space of Galilean [[velocity|velocities]] is itself a Euclidean space (see [[relative velocity]] for details).\n\n[[Topographical map]]s and [[technical drawing]]s are [[two-dimensional space|planar]] Euclidean. An idea behind them is the [[scale invariance]] of Euclidean geometry, that permits to represent large objects in a small sheet of paper, or a screen.\n\n==Alternatives and generalizations==\n<!-- caution: there are two links to this header from above part of the article -->\nAlthough Euclidean spaces are no longer considered to be the only possible setting for a [[geometry]], they act as prototypes for other geometric objects. Ideas and terminology from Euclidean geometry (both traditional and analytic) are pervasive in modern mathematics, where other geometric objects share many similarities with Euclidean spaces, share part of their structure, or embed Euclidean spaces.\n\n=== Curved spaces ===\n{{main article|Riemannian geometry}}\nA [[smooth manifold]] is a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] topological space that is locally [[diffeomorphic]] to Euclidean space. Diffeomorphism does not respect distance and angle, but if one additionally prescribes a smoothly varying inner product on the manifold's [[tangent space]]s, then the result is what is called a [[Riemannian manifold]]. Put differently, a {{visible anchor|Riemannian}} manifold is a space constructed by deforming and patching together Euclidean spaces. Such a space enjoys notions of distance and angle, but they behave in a [[curvature|curved]], non-Euclidean manner. The simplest Riemannian manifold, consisting of {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} with a constant inner product, is essentially identical to Euclidean {{mvar|n}}-space itself. Less trivial examples are [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]] and [[hyperbolic space]]s. Discovery of the latter in the 19th century was branded as the [[non-Euclidean geometry]].\n\nAlso, the concept of a Riemannian manifold permits an expression of the Euclidean structure in any [[diffeomorphism|smooth]] [[coordinate system]], via [[metric tensor]]. From this tensor one can compute the [[Riemann curvature tensor]]. Where the latter equals to zero, the metric structure is locally Euclidean (it means that at least some [[open set]] in the [[coordinate space]] is isometric to a piece of Euclidean space), no matter whether coordinates are affine or curvilinear.\n\n=== Indefinite quadratic form ===\n{{see also|Sylvester's law of inertia}}\nIf one replaces the inner product of a Euclidean space with an indefinite quadratic form, the result is a [[pseudo-Euclidean space]]. Smooth manifolds built from such spaces are called [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s. Perhaps their most famous application is the [[theory of relativity]], where flat [[spacetime]] is a pseudo-Euclidean space called [[Minkowski space]], where rotations correspond to motions of hyperbolic spaces mentioned [[#Riemannian|above]]. Further generalization to curved spacetimes form pseudo-Riemannian manifolds, such as in [[general relativity]].\n\n=== Other number fields ===\nAnother line of generalization is to consider other [[field (mathematics)|number fields]] than one of real numbers. Over [[complex numbers]], a [[Hilbert space]] can be seen as a generalization of Euclidean dot product structure, although the definition of the inner product becomes a [[sesquilinear form]] for compatibility with metric structure.\n\n=== Infinite dimensions ===\n{{main article|inner product space|Hilbert space}}\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Function of several real variables]], a coordinate presentation of a function on a Euclidean space\n* [[Geometric algebra]], an alternative algebraic formalism\n* [[High-dimensional space]]\n* [[Real coordinate space]], a frequently used representation of Euclidean space\n* [[Vector calculus]], a standard algebraic formalism\n* [[Vector space]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em|group=footnote}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{springer|title=Euclidean space|id=p/e036380}}\n\n{{Functional Analysis}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Euclidean Space}}\n[[Category:Euclidean geometry]]\n[[Category:Linear algebra]]\n[[Category:Topological spaces]]\n[[Category:Norms (mathematics)]]\n<!-- really a good idea?

Abbey began as an illustrator, producing numerous illustrations and sketches for such magazines as [[Harper's Weekly]] (1871\u20131874) and [[Scribner's Magazine]]. His illustrations began appearing in [[Harper's Weekly]] at an early age: before Abbey was twenty years old. He moved to New York City in 1871.

He exhibited \"Richard duke of Gloucester and the Lady Anne\" there in 1896, and in that year was elected [[Royal Academy of Arts#Membership|A.R.A.]], becoming a full member in 1898.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> In 1902 he was chosen to paint the coronation of [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. It was the official painting of the occasion and, hence, resides at [[Buckingham Palace]]. He did receive a knighthood,<ref name=\"Colliers\"/> although some say he refused it in 1907. Friendly with other expatriate American artists, he summered at [[Broadway, Worcestershire]], England, where he painted and vacationed alongside [[John Singer Sargent]] at the home of [[Francis Davis Millet]].\n\nHe completed murals for the Boston Public Library in the 1890s. The frieze for the Library was titled \"The Quest and Achievement of the Holy Grail\". It took Abbey eleven years to complete this series of murals in his England studio.\n\nIn 1904 he painted a mural for the [[Royal Exchange, London]] ''Reconciliation of the Skinners & Merchant Taylors' Companies by Lord Mayor Billesden, 1484''.\n\n===Pennsylvania State Capitol===\nIn 1908\u201309, Abbey began an ambitious program of murals and other artworks for the newly completed [[Pennsylvania State Capitol]] in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]. These included [[allegorical]] medallion murals representing ''Science'', ''Art'', ''Justice'', and ''Religion'' for the dome of the [[Rotunda (architecture)|Rotunda]], four large lunette murals beneath the dome, and multiple works for the House and Senate Chambers.

Proponents suggest that it seeks to integrate psychology into the other natural sciences, rooting it in the organizing theory of biology ([[evolutionary theory]]), and thus understanding [[psychology]] as a branch of [[biology]]. Anthropologist [[John Tooby]] and psychologist [[Leda Cosmides]] note:\n\n<blockquote>Evolutionary psychology is the long-forestalled scientific attempt to assemble out of the disjointed, fragmentary, and mutually contradictory human disciplines a single, logically integrated research framework for the psychological, social, and behavioral sciences \u2013 a framework\nthat not only incorporates the evolutionary sciences on a full and equal basis, but that systematically works out all of the revisions in existing belief and research practice that such a synthesis requires.<ref>Tooby & Cosmides 2005, p. 5</ref></blockquote>\n\nJust as human [[physiology]] and [[evolutionary physiology]] have worked to identify physical adaptations of the body that represent \"human physiological nature,\" the purpose of evolutionary psychology is to identify evolved emotional and cognitive adaptations that represent \"human psychological nature.\" According to [[Steven Pinker]], it is \"not a single theory but a large set of hypotheses\" and a term that \"has also come to refer to a particular way of applying evolutionary theory to the mind, with an emphasis on adaptation, gene-level selection, and modularity.\" Evolutionary psychology adopts an understanding of the mind that is based on the [[computational theory of mind]]. It describes mental processes as computational operations, so that, for example, a fear response is described as arising from a neurological computation that inputs the perceptional data, e.g. a visual image of a spider, and outputs the appropriate reaction, e.g. fear of possibly dangerous animals. Under this view, any [[Domain-general learning]] is impossible because of the [[Combinatorial explosion]]. This implies [[Domain-specific learning]]. Evolutionary Psychology specifies the domain as the problems of survival and reproduction. <ref> Buss, David M. \"Evolutionary Psychology: The New Science of The Mind\" 5th edition. pages 28-29. </ref> \n\nWhile philosophers have generally considered the human mind to include broad faculties, such as reason and lust, evolutionary psychologists describe evolved psychological mechanisms as narrowly focused to deal with specific issues, such as catching cheaters or choosing mates. The discipline views the [[human brain]] as comprising many functional mechanisms,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} called ''psychological adaptations'' or evolved cognitive mechanisms or ''[[cognitive modules]]'', designed by the process of natural selection. Examples include [[language acquisition|language-acquisition modules]], [[Westermarck effect|incest-avoidance mechanisms]], [[Wason selection task|cheater-detection mechanisms]], intelligence and sex-specific mating preferences, foraging mechanisms, alliance-tracking mechanisms, agent-detection mechanisms, and others. Some mechanisms, termed ''domain-specific'', deal with recurrent adaptive problems over the course of human evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''Domain-general'' mechanisms, on the other hand, are proposed to deal with evolutionary novelty.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nEvolutionary psychology has roots in [[cognitive psychology]] and evolutionary biology but also draws on [[behavioral ecology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[genetics]], [[ethology]], [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], biology, and [[zoology]]. It is closely linked to [[sociobiology]],<ref name=Psychology/> but there are key differences between them including the emphasis on ''domain-specific'' rather than ''domain-general'' mechanisms, the relevance of measures of current [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], the importance of [[mismatch theory]], and psychology rather than behavior.

In 1975, [[E.O. Wilson|Edward O. Wilson]] combined evolutionary theory with studies of animal and social behavior, building on the works of Lorenz and Tinbergen, in his book ''[[Sociobiology: The New Synthesis]]''.\n\nIn the 1970s, two major branches developed from ethology. Firstly, the study of animal ''social'' behavior (including humans) generated [[sociobiology]], defined by its pre-eminent proponent Edward O. Wilson in 1975 as \"the systematic study of the biological basis of all social behavior\"<ref>Wilson, Edward O. 1975.[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/WILSOR.html ''Sociobiology: The New Synthesis''.] Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. {{ISBN|0-674-00089-7}} p. 4.</ref> and in 1978 as \"the extension of population biology and evolutionary theory to social organization.\"<ref>Wilson, Edward O. 1978. ''On Human Nature''. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Ma. p. x.</ref> Secondly, there was behavioral ecology which placed less emphasis on ''social'' behavior; it focused on the ecological and evolutionary basis of animal and [[human behavioral ecology|human]] behavior.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s university departments began to include the term ''evolutionary biology'' in their titles. The modern era of evolutionary psychology was ushered in, in particular, by [[Donald Symons]]' 1979 book ''[[The Evolution of Human Sexuality]]'' and [[Leda Cosmides]] and [[John Tooby]]'s 1992 book ''[[The Adapted Mind]]''.<ref name=Psychology/>\n\nFrom psychology there are the primary streams of [[developmental psychology|developmental]], [[social psychology|social]] and cognitive psychology. Establishing some measure of the relative influence of genetics and environment on behavior has been at the core of [[Behavioural genetics|behavioral genetics]] and its variants, notably studies at the molecular level that examine the relationship between genes, neurotransmitters and behavior. [[Dual inheritance theory]] (DIT), developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, has a slightly different perspective by trying to explain how [[human behavior]] is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: [[genetic evolution]] and [[cultural evolution]]. DIT is seen by some as a \"middle-ground\" between views that emphasize human universals versus those that emphasize cultural variation.<ref>Laland, Kevin N. and Gillian R. Brown. 2002. ''Sense & Nonsense: Evolutionary Perspectives on Human Behavior.'' Oxford University Press, Oxford. pp. 287\u2013319.</ref>\n\n==Theoretical foundations==\n{{Main article|Theoretical foundations of evolutionary psychology}}\nThe theories on which evolutionary psychology is based originated with Charles Darwin's work, including his speculations about the evolutionary origins of social instincts in humans. Modern evolutionary psychology, however, is possible only because of advances in evolutionary theory in the 20th century.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists say that natural selection has provided humans with many psychological adaptations, in much the same way that it generated humans' anatomical and physiological adaptations.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 25\u201356.</ref> As with adaptations in general, psychological adaptations are said to be specialized for the environment in which an organism evolved, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/><ref name=Economics-2003>See also \"Environment of evolutionary adaptation,\" a variation of the term used in Economics, e.g., in {{cite journal | last1 = Rubin | first1 = Paul H | year = 2003 | title = Folk economics | journal = Southern Economic Journal | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 157\u201371 | doi=10.2307/1061637}}</ref> Sexual selection provides organisms with adaptations related to mating.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> For male [[mammal]]s, which have a relatively high maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to adaptations that help them compete for females.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> For female mammals, with a relatively low maximal potential reproduction rate, sexual selection leads to choosiness, which helps females select higher quality mates.<ref name=Gaulin-Steven-J-C-2003-pp.25-56/> Charles Darwin described both natural selection and sexual selection, and he relied on group selection to explain the evolution of [[Altruism|altruistic]] (self-sacrificing) behavior. But group selection was considered a weak explanation, because in any group the less altruistic individuals will be more likely to survive, and the group will become less self-sacrificing as a whole.\n\nIn 1964, [[W.D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] proposed [[inclusive fitness]] theory, emphasizing a [[gene-centered view of evolution]]. Hamilton noted that genes can increase the replication of copies of themselves into the next generation by influencing the organism's social traits in such a way that (statistically) results in helping the survival and reproduction of other copies of the same genes (most simply, identical copies in the organism's close relatives). According to [[Hamilton's rule]], self-sacrificing behaviors (and the genes influencing them) can evolve if they typically help the organism's close relatives so much that it more than compensates for the individual animal's sacrifice. Inclusive fitness theory resolved the issue of how altruism can evolve. Other theories also help explain the evolution of altruistic behavior, including [[evolutionary game theory]], [[tit-for-tat]] reciprocity, and generalized reciprocity. These theories help to explain the development of altruistic behavior, and account for hostility toward cheaters (individuals that take advantage of others' altruism).<ref name=moralanimal/>\n\nSeveral mid-level evolutionary theories inform evolutionary psychology. The [[r/K selection]] theory proposes that some species prosper by having many offspring, while others follow the strategy of having fewer offspring but investing much more in each one. Humans follow the second strategy. Parental investment theory explains how parents invest more or less in individual offspring based on how successful those offspring are likely to be, and thus how much they might improve the parents' inclusive fitness. According to the [[Trivers-Willard hypothesis]], parents in good conditions tend to invest more in sons (who are best able to take advantage of good conditions), while parents in poor conditions tend to invest more in daughters (who are best able to have successful offspring even in poor conditions). According to [[life history theory]], animals evolve life histories to match their environments, determining details such as age at first reproduction and number of offspring. Dual inheritance theory posits that genes and human culture have interacted, with genes affecting the development of culture, and culture, in turn, affecting human evolution on a genetic level (see also the [[Baldwin effect]]).\n\n==Evolved psychological mechanisms==\n{{Main article|psychological adaptation|l1=Evolved psychological mechanisms}}\nEvolutionary psychology is based on the hypothesis that, just like hearts, lungs, livers, kidneys, and immune systems, cognition has functional structure that has a genetic basis, and therefore has evolved by natural selection. Like other organs and tissues, this functional structure should be universally shared amongst a species, and should solve important problems of survival and [[reproduction]].\n\nEvolutionary psychologists seek to understand psychological mechanisms by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might have served over the course of evolutionary history.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} These might include abilities to infer others' emotions, discern kin from non-kin, identify and prefer healthier mates, cooperate with others and follow leaders. Consistent with the theory of natural selection, evolutionary psychology sees humans as often in conflict with others, including mates and relatives. For instance, a mother may wish to wean her offspring from breastfeeding earlier than does her infant, which frees up the mother to invest in additional offspring.<ref name=moralanimal/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://scilib-biology.narod.ru/MoralAnimal/index_en.html |title=The Moral Animal: Why We Are The Way We Are: The New Science of Evolutionary Psychology |accessdate=15 October 2013 |first=Robert |last=Wright}}</ref> Evolutionary psychology also recognizes the role of kin selection and reciprocity in evolving prosocial traits such as altruism.<ref name=moralanimal/> Like [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s, humans have subtle and flexible social instincts, allowing them to form extended families, lifelong friendships, and political alliances.<ref name=moralanimal/> In studies testing theoretical predictions, evolutionary psychologists have made modest findings on topics such as infanticide, intelligence, marriage patterns, promiscuity, perception of beauty, bride price and parental investment.<ref name=social-behavior/>\n\n===Historical topics===\nProponents of evolutionary psychology in the 1990s made some explorations in historical events, but the response from historical experts was highly negative and there has been little effort to continue that line of research. Historian [[Lynn Hunt]] says that the historians complained that the researchers:\n:have read the wrong studies, misinterpreted the results of experiments, or worse yet, turned to neuroscience looking for a universalizing, anti-representational and anti-intentional ontology to bolster their claims.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hunt | first1 = Lynn | year = 2014 | title = The Self and Its History | url = | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 119 | issue = 5| pages = 1576\u201386 | doi=10.1093/ahr/119.5.1576}} quote p 1576.</ref>\n\nHunt states that, \"the few attempts to build up a subfield of psychohistory collapsed under the weight of its presuppositions.\" She concludes that as of 2014 the \"'iron curtain' between historians and psychology...remains standing.\"<ref>Hunt, \"The Self and Its History.\" p. 1578.</ref>\n\n===Products of evolution: adaptations, exaptations, byproducts, and random variation===\nNot all traits of organisms are evolutionary adaptations. As noted in the table below, traits may also be [[exaptation]]s, byproducts of adaptations (sometimes called \"spandrels\"), or random variation between individuals.<ref>Buss et al. 1998</ref>\n\nPsychological adaptations are hypothesized to be innate or relatively easy to learn, and to manifest in cultures worldwide. For example, the ability of toddlers to learn a language with virtually no training is likely to be a psychological adaptation. On the other hand, ancestral humans did not read or write, thus today, learning to read and write require extensive training, and presumably represent byproducts of cognitive processing that use psychological adaptations designed for other functions.<ref>Pinker, Steven. (1994) The Language Instinct</ref> However, variations in manifest behavior can result from universal mechanisms interacting with different local environments. For example, Caucasians who move from a northern climate to the equator will have darker skin. The mechanisms regulating their pigmentation do not change; rather the input to those mechanisms change, resulting in different output.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! !! Adaptation !! Exaptation !!

[[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] suggested that an \"adaptation is a special and onerous concept that should only be used where it is really necessary.\"<ref>George C Williams, ''Adaptation and Natural Selection''. p. 4.</ref> As noted by Williams and others, adaptations can be identified by their improbable complexity, species universality, and adaptive functionality.\n\n===Obligate and facultative adaptations===\nA question that may be asked about an adaptation is whether it is generally obligate (relatively robust in the face of typical environmental variation) or facultative (sensitive to typical environmental variation).<ref name=Buss-D-M-2011>Buss, D. M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology.</ref> The sweet taste of sugar and the pain of hitting one's knee against concrete are the result of fairly obligate psychological adaptations; typical environmental variability during development does not much affect their operation. By contrast, facultative adaptations are somewhat like \"if-then\" statements. For example, adult attachment style seems particularly sensitive to early childhood experiences. As adults, the propensity to develop close, trusting bonds with others is dependent on whether early childhood caregivers could be trusted to provide reliable assistance and attention. The adaptation for skin to tan is conditional to exposure to sunlight; this is an example of another facultative adaptation. When a psychological adaptation is facultative, evolutionary psychologists concern themselves with how developmental and environmental inputs influence the expression of the adaptation.\n\n===Cultural universals===\n{{main article|Cultural universal}}\nEvolutionary psychologists hold that behaviors or traits that occur universally in all cultures are good candidates for evolutionary adaptations.<ref name=Psychology/> Cultural universals include behaviors related to language, cognition, social roles, gender roles, and technology.<ref>[[Donald E. Brown|Brown, Donald E.]] (1991) Human Universals. New York: McGraw-Hill.</ref> Evolved psychological adaptations (such as the ability to learn a language) interact with cultural inputs to produce specific behaviors (e.g., the specific language learned). Basic gender differences, such as greater eagerness for sex among men and greater coyness among women,<ref>Symons, D. (1979). The evolution of human sexuality. Oxford: Oxford University Press. Chapter 6.</ref> are explained as sexually dimorphic psychological adaptations that reflect the different reproductive strategies of males and females.<ref name=moralanimal/><ref name=BS>Pinker 2002</ref> Evolutionary psychologists contrast their approach to what they term the \"[[standard social science model]],\" according to which the mind is a general-purpose cognition device shaped almost entirely by culture.<ref>Barkow et al. 1992</ref><ref name=instinct>\"instinct.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

That environment is often referred to as the \"environment of evolutionary adaptedness\".<ref name=Economics-2003/>\n\nThe idea of an ''environment of evolutionary adaptedness'' was first explored as a part of [[attachment theory]] by [[John Bowlby]].<ref name=Bowlby1969>{{cite book |last=Bowlby |first=John |title=Attachment |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1969}}</ref> This is the environment to which a particular evolved mechanism is adapted. More specifically, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness is defined as the set of historically recurring selection pressures that formed a given adaptation, as well as those aspects of the environment that were necessary for the proper development and functioning of the adaptation.\n\nHumans, comprising the genus ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', appeared between 1.5 and 2.5 million years ago, a time that roughly coincides with the start of the [[Pleistocene]] 2.6 million years ago. Because the Pleistocene ended a mere 12,000 years ago, most human adaptations either newly evolved during the Pleistocene, or were maintained by [[stabilizing selection]] during the Pleistocene. Evolutionary psychology therefore proposes that the majority of human psychological mechanisms are adapted to reproductive problems frequently encountered in Pleistocene environments.<ref name=Symons1992>{{cite book |last=Symons |first=Donald |authorlink=Donald Symons |chapter=On the use and misuse of Darwinism in the study of human behavior |title=The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary psychology and the generation of culture |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |pages=137\u201359 |isbn=0-19-510107-3}}</ref> In broad terms, these problems include those of growth, development, differentiation, maintenance, mating, parenting, and social relationships.\n\nThe environment of evolutionary adaptedness is significantly different from modern society.<ref name=EBO-social/> The ancestors of modern humans lived in smaller groups, had more cohesive cultures, and had more stable and rich contexts for identity and meaning.<ref name=EBO-social>\"social behaviour, animal.\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

Because humans are mostly adapted to [[Pleistocene]] environments, psychological mechanisms sometimes exhibit \"mismatches\" to the modern environment. One example is the fact that although about 10,000 people are killed with guns in the US annually,<ref>[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr54/nvsr54_10.pdf CDC pdf]</ref> whereas spiders and snakes kill only a handful, people nonetheless learn to fear spiders and snakes about as easily as they do a pointed gun, and more easily than an unpointed gun, rabbits or flowers.<ref name=Ohman2001>{{cite journal |last1=Ohman |first1=A. |last2=Mineka |first2=S. |year=2001 |title=Fears, phobias, and preparedness: Toward an evolved module of fear and fear learning |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=3 |pages=483\u2013522 |url=http://instruct.uwo.ca/psychology/371g/Ohman2001.pdf |accessdate=16 June 2008 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.3.483 |pmid=11488376}}</ref> A potential explanation is that spiders and snakes were a threat to human ancestors throughout the Pleistocene, whereas guns (and rabbits and flowers) were not.

The term was coined by [[Niko Tinbergen]] to refer to non-human animal behavior, but psychologist [[Deirdre Barrett]] said that supernormal stimulation governs the behavior of humans as powerfully as that of other animals. She explained junk food as an exaggerated stimulus to cravings for salt, sugar, and fats,<ref>Barrett, Deirdre. Waistland: The R/Evolutionary Science Behind Our Weight and Fitness Crisis (2007). New York: W.W. Norton. pp. 31\u201351.</ref> and she says that television is an exaggeration of social cues of laughter, smiling faces and attention-grabbing action.<ref>Barrett, Deirdre.

Naturally Selected: The Evolutionary Science of Leadership (2011). New York: Harper Business.</ref> His argument is that humans are not adapted to work in large, anonymous bureaucratic structures with formal hierarchies. The human mind still responds to personalized, charismatic leadership primarily in the context of informal, egalitarian settings. Hence the dissatisfaction and alienation that many employees experience. Salaries, bonuses and other privileges exploit instincts for relative status, which attract particularly males to senior executive positions.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Vugt |first1=Mark |last2=Ronay |first2=Richard |year=2014 |title=The Evolutionary Psychology of Leadership |url=|journal=Organizational Psychology Review |volume=4 |issue=|pages=74\u201395 |doi=10.1177/2041386613493635}}</ref>\n\n==Research methods==\nEvolutionary theory is [[heuristic]] in that it may generate hypotheses that might not be developed from other theoretical approaches. One of the major goals of adaptationist research is to identify which organismic traits are likely to be adaptations, and which are byproducts or random variations. As noted earlier, adaptations are expected to show evidence of complexity, functionality, and species universality, while byproducts or random variation will not. In addition, adaptations are expected to manifest as proximate mechanisms that interact with the environment in either a generally obligate or facultative fashion (see above). Evolutionary psychologists are also interested in identifying these proximate mechanisms (sometimes termed \"mental mechanisms\" or \"psychological adaptations\") and what type of information they take as input, how they process that information, and their outputs.<ref name=Buss-D-M-2011/> [[Evolutionary developmental psychology]], or \"evo-devo,\" focuses on how adaptations may be activated at certain developmental times (e.g., losing baby teeth, adolescence, etc.) or how events during the development of an individual may alter life history trajectories.\n\nEvolutionary psychologists use several strategies to develop and test hypotheses about whether a psychological trait is likely to be an evolved adaptation. Buss (2011)<ref>Buss, D.M. (2011). Evolutionary psychology. Chapter 2. Boston: Pearson/A and B.</ref> notes that these methods include:\n\n:''Cross-cultural Consistency.'' Characteristics that have been demonstrated to be cross cultural [[human universals]] such as smiling, crying, facial expressions are presumed to be evolved psychological adaptations. Several evolutionary psychologists have collected massive datasets from cultures around the world to assess cross-cultural universality.\n\n:''Function to Form (or \"problem to solution\").'' The fact that males, but not females, risk potential misidentification of genetic offspring (referred to as \"paternity insecurity\") led evolutionary psychologists to hypothesize that, compared to females, male jealousy would be more focused on sexual, rather than emotional, infidelity.\n\n:''Form to Function (reverse-engineering \u2013 or \"solution to problem\").'' [[Morning sickness]], and associated aversions to certain types of food, during pregnancy seemed to have the characteristics of an evolved adaptation (complexity and universality). [[Margie Profet]] hypothesized that the function was to avoid the ingestion of toxins during early pregnancy that could damage fetus (but which are otherwise likely to be harmless to healthy non-pregnant women).\n\n:''Corresponding Neurological Modules.'' Evolutionary psychology and cognitive neuropsychology are mutually compatible \u2013 evolutionary psychology helps to identify psychological adaptations and their ultimate, evolutionary functions, while neuropsychology helps to identify the proximate manifestations of these adaptations.\n\n:''Current evolutionary Adaptiveness.'' In addition to evolutionary models that suggest evolution occurs across large spans of time, recent research has demonstrated that some evolutionary shifts can be fast and dramatic. Consequently, some evolutionary psychologists have focused on the impact of psychological traits in the current environment. Such research can be used to inform estimates of the prevalence of traits over time. Such work has been informative in studying evolutionary psychopathology.<ref>Jacobson, N.C. (2016). Current Evolutionary Adaptiveness of Psychiatric Disorders: Fertility Rates, Parent-Child Relationship Quality, and Psychiatric Disorders.

Baars.<ref>Baars, Bernard J. ''A Cognitive Theory of Consciousness.'' 1993. Cambridge University Press.</ref> Richard Dawkins suggested that humans evolved consciousness in order to make themselves the subjects of thought.<ref name=Gaulin-5/> Daniel Povinelli suggests that large, tree-climbing apes evolved consciousness to take into account one's own mass when moving safely among tree branches.<ref name=Gaulin-5/> Consistent with this hypothesis, Gordon Gallup found that chimps and orangutans, but not little monkeys or terrestrial gorillas, demonstrated self-awareness in mirror tests.<ref name=Gaulin-5/>\n\nThe concept of consciousness can refer to voluntary action, awareness, or wakefulness. However, even voluntary behavior involves unconscious mechanisms. Many cognitive processes take place in the cognitive unconscious, unavailable to conscious awareness. Some behaviors are conscious when learned but then become unconscious, seemingly automatic. Learning, especially implicitly learning a skill, can take place outside of consciousness. For example, plenty of people know how to turn right when they ride a bike, but very few can accurately explain how they actually do so. Evolutionary psychology approaches self-deception as an adaptation that can improve one's results in social exchanges.<ref name=Gaulin-5/>\n\nSleep may have evolved to conserve energy when activity would be less fruitful or more dangerous, such as at night, especially in winter.<ref name=Gaulin-5>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 p. 101\u201321.</ref>\n\n====Sensation and perception====\n{{See also|Sensation (psychology)|perception}}\n\nMany experts, such as [[Jerry Fodor]], write that the purpose of perception is knowledge, but evolutionary psychologists hold that its primary purpose is to guide action.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, they say, [[depth perception]] seems to have evolved not to help us know the distances to other objects but rather to help us move around in space.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Evolutionary psychologists say that animals from fiddler crabs to humans use eyesight for collision avoidance, suggesting that vision is basically for directing action, not providing knowledge.<ref name=Gaulin-4>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 81\u2013101.</ref>\n\nBuilding and maintaining sense organs is metabolically expensive, so these organs evolve only when they improve an organism's fitness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> More than half the brain is devoted to processing sensory information, and the brain itself consumes roughly one-fourth of one's metabolic resources, so the senses must provide exceptional benefits to fitness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Perception accurately mirrors the world; animals get useful, accurate information through their senses.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\nScientists who study perception and sensation have long understood the human senses as adaptations.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Depth perception consists of processing over half a dozen visual cues, each of which is based on a regularity of the physical world.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Vision evolved to respond to the narrow range of electromagnetic energy that is plentiful and that does not pass through objects.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Sound waves go around corners and interact with obstacles, creating a complex pattern that includes useful information about the sources of and distances to objects.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Larger animals naturally make lower-pitched sounds as a consequence of their size.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> The range over which an animal hears, on the other hand, is determined by adaptation. Homing pigeons, for example, can hear very low-pitched sound (infrasound) that carries great distances, even though most smaller animals detect higher-pitched sounds.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Taste and smell respond to chemicals in the environment that are thought to have been significant for fitness in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, salt and sugar were apparently both valuable to the human or pre-human inhabitants of the environment of evolutionary adaptedness, so present day humans have an intrinsic hunger for salty and sweet tastes.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> The sense of touch is actually many senses, including pressure, heat, cold, tickle, and pain.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Pain, while unpleasant, is adaptive.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> An important adaptation for senses is range shifting, by which the organism becomes temporarily more or less sensitive to sensation.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, one's eyes automatically adjust to dim or bright ambient light.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Sensory abilities of different organisms often coevolve, as is the case with the hearing of echolocating bats and that of the moths that have evolved to respond to the sounds that the bats make.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\nEvolutionary psychologists contend that perception demonstrates the principle of modularity, with specialized mechanisms handling particular perception tasks.<ref name=Gaulin-4/> For example, people with damage to a particular part of the brain suffer from the specific defect of not being able to recognize faces (prosopagnosia).<ref name=Gaulin-4/> Evolutionary psychology suggests that this indicates a so-called face-reading module.<ref name=Gaulin-4/>\n\n====Learning and facultative adaptations====\nIn evolutionary psychology, learning is said to be accomplished through evolved capacities, specifically facultative adaptations.<ref name=LearningG8>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 8.</ref> Facultative adaptations express themselves differently depending on input from the environment.<ref name=LearningG8/> Sometimes the input comes during development and helps shape that development.<ref name=LearningG8/> For example, migrating birds learn to orient themselves by the stars during a critical period in their maturation.<ref name=LearningG8/> Evolutionary psychologists believe that humans also learn language along an evolved program, also with critical periods.<ref name=LearningG8/> The input can also come during daily tasks, helping the organism cope with changing environmental conditions.<ref name=LearningG8/> For example, animals evolved Pavlovian conditioning in order to solve problems about causal relationships.<ref name=LearningG8/> Animals accomplish learning tasks most easily when those tasks resemble problems that they faced in their evolutionary past, such as a rat learning where to find food or water.<ref name=LearningG8/> Learning capacities sometimes demonstrate differences between the sexes.<ref name=LearningG8/> In many animal species, for example, males can solve spatial problem faster and more accurately than females, due to the effects of male hormones during development.<ref name=LearningG8/> The same might be true of humans.<ref name=LearningG8/>\n\n====Emotion and motivation====\n{{Main article|Evolution of emotion}}\nMotivations direct and energize behavior, while emotions provide the affective component to motivation, positive or negative.<ref name=Gaulin-6>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 pp. 121\u201342.</ref> In the early 1970s, [[Paul Ekman]] and colleagues began a line of research which suggests that many emotions are universal.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> He found evidence that humans share at least five basic emotions: fear, sadness, happiness, anger, and disgust.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Social emotions evidently evolved to motivate social behaviors that were adaptive in the environment of evolutionary adaptedness.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> For example, spite seems to work against the individual but it can establish an individual's reputation as someone to be feared.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Shame and pride can motivate behaviors that help one maintain one's standing in a community, and self-esteem is one's estimate of one's status.<ref name=moralanimal/><ref name=Gaulin-6/>\nMotivation has a neurobiological basis in the [[reward system]] of the brain. Recently, it has been suggested that reward systems may evolve in such a way that there may be an [[inherent]] or unavoidable [[trade-off]] in the motivational system for activities of short versus long duration.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Belke | first1 = T.

From an evolutionary psychology perspective, cognition is not \"general purpose,\" but uses heuristics, or strategies, that generally increase the likelihood of solving problems that the ancestors of present-day humans routinely faced. For example, present day humans are far more likely to solve logic problems that involve detecting cheating (a common problem given humans' social nature) than the same logic problem put in purely abstract terms.<ref name=Gaulin-7>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 7.</ref> Since the ancestors of present-day humans did not encounter truly random events, present day humans may be cognitively predisposed to incorrectly identify patterns in random sequences. \"Gamblers' Fallacy\" is one example of this. Gamblers may falsely believe that they have hit a \"lucky streak\" even when each outcome is actually random and independent of previous trials. Most people believe that if a fair coin has been flipped 9 times and Heads appears each time, that on the tenth flip, there is a greater than 50% chance of getting Tails.<ref name=Gaulin-6/> Humans find it far easier to make diagnoses or predictions using frequency data than when the same information is presented as probabilities or percentages, presumably because the ancestors of present-day humans lived in relatively small tribes (usually with fewer than 150 people) where frequency information was more readily available.<ref name=Gaulin-6/>\n\n====Personality====\nEvolutionary psychology is primarily interested in finding commonalities between people, or basic human psychological nature. From an evolutionary perspective, the fact that people have fundamental differences in personality traits initially presents something of a puzzle.<ref name=Gaulin-9>Gaulin and McBurney 2003 Chapter 9.</ref> (Note: The field of behavioral genetics is concerned with statistically partitioning differences between people into genetic and environmental sources of variance. However, understanding the concept of [[heritability]] can be tricky \u2013 heritability refers only to the differences between people, never the degree to which the traits of an individual are due to environmental or genetic factors, since traits are always a complex interweaving of both.)\n\nPersonality traits are conceptualized by evolutionary psychologists as due to normal variation around an optimum, due to frequency-dependent selection (behavioral [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]), or as facultative adaptations. Like variability in height, some personality traits may simply reflect inter-individual variability around a general optimum.<ref name=Gaulin-9/> Or, personality traits may represent different genetically predisposed \"behavioral morphs\" \u2013 alternate behavioral strategies that depend on the frequency of competing behavioral strategies in the population.

Pinker and [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Bloom]] (1990) argue that language as a mental faculty shares many likenesses with the complex organs of the body which suggests that, like these organs, language has evolved as an adaptation, since this is the only known mechanism by which such complex organs can develop.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pinker |first1=S. |last2=Bloom |first2=P. |year=1990 |title=Natural language and natural selection |journal=[[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=707\u201327 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061 |citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4044 }}</ref>\n\nPinker follows Chomsky in arguing that the fact that children can learn any human language with no explicit instruction suggests that language, including most of grammar, is basically innate and that it only needs to be activated by interaction.

Tomasello argues that studies of how children and primates actually acquire communicative skills suggests that humans learn complex behavior through experience, so that instead of a module specifically dedicated to language acquisition, language is acquired by the same cognitive mechanisms that are used to acquire all other kinds of socially transmitted behavior.<ref>Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.

Tecumseh Fitch]], following [[Stephen J. Gould]], argues that it is unwarranted to assume that every aspect of language is an adaptation, or that language as a whole is an adaptation. He criticizes some strands of evolutionary psychology for suggesting a pan-adaptionist view of evolution, and dismisses Pinker and Bloom's question of whether \"Language has evolved as an adaptation\" as being misleading. He argues instead that from a biological viewpoint the evolutionary origins of language is best conceptualized as being the probable result of a convergence of many separate adaptations into a complex system.<ref>W. Tecumseh Fitch (2010) The Evolution of Language.

Several evolutionary hypotheses have been posited: that it evolved for the purpose of social grooming, that it evolved as a way to show mating potential or that it evolved to form social contracts. Evolutionary psychologists recognize that these theories are all speculative and that much more evidence is required to understand how language might have been selectively adapted.<ref>Workman, Lance and Will Reader (2004) Evolutionary psychology: an introduction.

(1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), ''Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man''. Chicago: Aldine-Atherton.</ref> on sex differences that is now referred to as [[Parental investment|parental investment theory]]. The size differences of [[gametes]] ([[anisogamy]]) is the fundamental, defining difference between males (small gametes \u2013 sperm) and females (large gametes \u2013 ova). Trivers noted that anisogamy typically results in different levels of parental investment between the sexes, with females initially investing more. Trivers proposed that this difference in parental investment leads to the [[sexual selection]] of different [[Human mating strategies|reproductive strategies]] between the sexes and to [[sexual conflict]]. For example, he suggested that the sex that invests less in offspring will generally compete for access to the higher-investing sex to increase their [[inclusive fitness]] (also see [[Bateman's principle]]<ref name=\"doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21\">{{Cite journal| first1 = A.

Trivers posited that differential parental investment led to the evolution of sexual dimorphisms in [[mate choice]], intra- and inter- sexual reproductive competition, and [[courtship display]]s. In mammals, including humans, females make a much larger parental investment than males (i.e. [[gestation]] followed by childbirth and [[lactation]]).

However, under some circumstances, short term mating can provide benefits to women as well, such as fertility insurance, trading up to better genes, reducing risk of inbreeding, and insurance protection of her offspring.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/sep/03/anthonybrowne.theobserver|title=Women are promiscuous, naturally|first1=Anthony|last1=Browne|first2=health|last2=editor|date=2 September 2000|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref>\n\nDue to male paternity insecurity, sex differences have been found in the domains of [[sexual jealousy]].<ref>Buss 1989</ref><ref>Buss et al. 1992</ref> Females generally react more adversely to emotional infidelity and males will react more to sexual infidelity. This particular pattern is predicted because the costs involved in mating for each sex are distinct. Women, on average, should prefer a mate who can offer resources (e.g., financial, commitment), thus, a woman risks losing such resources with a mate who commits emotional infidelity. Men, on the other hand, are never certain of the genetic paternity of their children because they do not bear the offspring themselves (\"paternity insecurity\"). This suggests that for men sexual infidelity would generally be more aversive than emotional infidelity because investing resources in another man's offspring does not lead to propagation of their own genes.<ref>Kalat, J.

These putative preferences are predicted to be especially apparent for short-term mating domains because a potential male mate would only be offering genes to a potential offspring. This hypothesis allows researchers to examine whether women select mates who have characteristics that indicate high genetic quality during the high fertility phase of their ovulatory cycles. Indeed, studies have shown that women's preferences vary across the ovulatory cycle. In particular, Haselton and Miller (2006) showed that highly fertile women prefer creative but poor men as short-term mates. Creativity may be a proxy for good genes.<ref>Miller, G. F. (2000b) ''The mating mind: How sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature''. Anchor Books: New York.</ref> Research by Gangestad et al. (2004) indicates that highly fertile women prefer men who display social presence and intrasexual competition; these traits may act as cues that would help women predict which men may have, or would be able to acquire, resources.\n\n===Parenting===\n{{Main article|Evolutionary psychology of parenting}}\n\nReproduction is always costly for women, and can also be for men. Individuals are limited in the degree to which they can devote time and resources to producing and raising their young, and such expenditure may also be detrimental to their future condition, survival and further reproductive output.\nParental investment is any parental expenditure (time, energy etc.) that benefits one [[offspring]] at a cost to parents' ability to invest in other components of fitness (Clutton-Brock 1991: 9; Trivers 1972). Components of fitness (Beatty 1992) include the well-being of existing offspring, parents' future [[sexual reproduction|reproduction]], and inclusive fitness through aid to kin ([[W. D. Hamilton|Hamilton]], 1964). Parental investment theory is a branch of life history theory.\n\nRobert Trivers' theory of parental investment predicts that the sex making the largest investment in [[lactation]], nurturing and protecting offspring will be more discriminating in mating and that the sex that invests less in offspring will compete for access to the higher investing sex (see [[Bateman's principle]]).<ref name=\"doi10.1038/hdy.1948.21\"/> Sex differences in parental effort are important in determining the strength of sexual selection.\n\nThe benefits of parental investment to the offspring are large and are associated with the effects on condition, growth, survival and ultimately, on reproductive success of the offspring. However, these benefits can come at the cost of parent's ability to reproduce in the future e.g. through the increased risk of injury when defending offspring against predators, the loss of mating opportunities whilst rearing offspring and an increase in the time to the next reproduction. Overall, parents are [[Selection (biology)|selected]] to maximize the difference between the benefits and the costs, and parental care will likely evolve when the benefits exceed the costs.\n\nThe [[Cinderella effect]] is an alleged high incidence of stepchildren being physically, emotionally or sexually abused, neglected, murdered, or otherwise mistreated at the hands of their stepparents at significantly higher rates than their genetic counterparts. It takes its name from the fairy tale character Cinderella, who in the story was cruelly mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters.<ref>Daly, Matin, and Margo I. Wilson. (1999)</ref> Daly and Wilson (1996) noted: \"Evolutionary thinking led to the discovery of the most important risk factor for child homicide \u2013 the presence of a stepparent. Parental efforts and investments are valuable resources, and selection favors those parental psyches that allocate effort effectively to promote fitness. The adaptive problems that challenge parental decision making include both the accurate identification of one's offspring and the allocation of one's resources among them with sensitivity to their needs and abilities to convert parental investment into fitness increments\u2026. Stepchildren were seldom or never so valuable to one's expected fitness as one's own offspring would be, and those parental psyches that were easily parasitized by just any appealing youngster must always have incurred a selective disadvantage\"(Daly & Wilson, 1996, pp.&nbsp;64\u201365). However, they note that not all stepparents will \"want\" to abuse their partner's children, or that genetic parenthood is any insurance against abuse. They see step parental care as primarily \"mating effort\" towards the genetic parent.<ref name=Daly_Wilson_98>Daly & Wilson 1998</ref>\n\n===Family and kin===\n{{see also|Human inclusive fitness|Kin selection}}\nInclusive fitness is the sum of an organism's classical fitness (how many of its own offspring it produces and supports) and the number of equivalents of its own offspring it can add to the population by supporting others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.personalityresearch.org/evolutionary/inclusive.html|title=Evolutionary Psychology \u2013 Inclusive Fitness|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2016}}</ref> The first component is called classical fitness by Hamilton (1964).\n\nFrom the gene's point of view, evolutionary success ultimately depends on leaving behind the maximum number of copies of itself in the population. Until 1964, it was generally believed that genes only achieved this by causing the individual to leave the maximum number of viable offspring. However, in 1964 W. D. Hamilton proved mathematically that, because close relatives of an organism share some identical genes, a gene can also increase its evolutionary success by promoting the reproduction and survival of these related or otherwise similar individuals. Hamilton concluded that this leads natural selection to favor organisms that would behave in ways that maximize their inclusive fitness. It is also true that natural selection favors behavior that maximizes personal fitness.\n\nHamilton's rule describes mathematically whether or not a gene for altruistic behavior will spread in a population:\n:<math>rb > c \\ </math>\nwhere\n* <math>c \\ </math> is the reproductive cost to the altruist,\n* <math>b \\ </math> is the reproductive benefit to the recipient of the altruistic behavior, and\n* <math>r \\ </math> is the probability, above the population average, of the individuals sharing an altruistic gene \u2013 commonly viewed as \"degree of relatedness\".\n\nThe concept serves to explain how natural selection can perpetuate altruism. If there is an \"altruism gene\" (or complex of genes) that influences an organism's behavior to be helpful and protective of relatives and their offspring, this behavior also increases the proportion of the altruism gene in the population, because relatives are likely to share genes with the altruist due to [[identical by descent|common descent]]. Altruists may also have some way to recognize altruistic behavior in unrelated individuals and be inclined to support them. As Dawkins points out in ''The Selfish Gene'' (Chapter 6) and ''The Extended Phenotype'',<ref>Dawkins, Richard, \"The Extended Phenotype\", Oxford University Press 1982 (Chapter 9)</ref> this must be distinguished from the [[green-beard effect]].\n\nAlthough it is generally true that humans tend to be more altruistic toward their kin than toward non-kin, the relevant proximate mechanisms that mediate this cooperation have been debated (see [[kin recognition]]), with some arguing that kin status is determined primarily via social and cultural factors (such as co-residence, maternal association of sibs, etc.),<ref name=W2010>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2010.08.001 |title=Sixteen common misconceptions about the evolution of cooperation in humans |year=2011 |last1=West |first1=Stuart A. |last2=El Mouden |first2=Claire |last3=Gardner |first3=Andy |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=231\u201362 |url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |access-date=25 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812085608/http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/WestElMoudenGardner_11.pdf |archive-date=12 August 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> while others have argued that kin recognition can also be mediated by biological factors such as facial resemblance and immunogenetic similarity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC).<ref>Villinger, J., and Waldman, B.

Direct reciprocity can lead to the evolution of cooperation only if the probability, w, of another encounter between the same two individuals exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n: w > c/b\n\nReciprocity can also be indirect if information about previous interactions is shared. Reputation allows evolution of cooperation by indirect reciprocity. Natural selection favors strategies that base the decision to help on the reputation of the recipient: studies show that people who are more helpful are more likely to receive help. The calculations of indirect reciprocity are complicated and only a tiny fraction of this universe has been uncovered, but again a simple rule has emerged.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=9634232 |year=1998 |last1=Nowak |first1=MA |last2=Sigmund |first2=K |title=Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring |volume=393 |issue=6685 |pages=573\u201377 |doi=10.1038/31225 |journal=Nature |authorlink1=Martin Nowak |authorlink2=Karl Sigmund |bibcode=1998Natur.393..573N }}</ref> Indirect reciprocity can only promote cooperation if the probability, q, of knowing someone\u2019s reputation exceeds the cost-to-benefit ratio of the altruistic act:\n: q > c/b\n\nOne important problem with this explanation is that individuals may be able to evolve the capacity to obscure their reputation, reducing the probability, q, that it will be known.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature04201 |title=Human cooperation: Second-order free-riding problem solved? |last1=Fowler |first1=James H. |journal=Nature |volume=437 |issue=7058 |pages=E8; discussion E8\u20139 |authorlink1=James H.

Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing. Males being more aggressive is hypothesized to stem from the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.<ref name=AEP>Aurelio Jos\u00e9 Figueredo, Paul Robert Gladden, Zachary Hohman.

Therefore, it was important to be perceived as having a credible reputation for retaliation, resulting in humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting reputation (\"[[honor]]\"). Pinker argues that the development of the state and the police have dramatically reduced the level of violence compared to the ancestral environment. Whenever the state breaks down, which can be very locally such as in poor areas of a city, humans again organize in groups for protection and aggression and concepts such as violent revenge and protecting honor again become extremely important.<ref name=AEP/>\n\nRape is theorized to be a reproductive strategy that facilitates the propagation of the rapist's progency.

One example is the evolutionary psychology model of extended social groups selecting for modern human brains, a contradiction being that the synaptic function of modern human brains require high amounts of many specific [[nutrient#Essentiality|essential nutrients]] so that such a transition to higher requirements of the same essential nutrients being shared by all individuals in a population would decrease the possibility of forming large groups due to bottleneck foods with rare essential nutrients capping group sizes. It is mentioned that some insects have societies with different ranks for each individual and that monkeys remain socially functioning after removal of most of the brain as additional arguments against big brains promoting social networking. The model of males as both providers and protectors is criticized for the impossibility of being in two places at once, the male cannot both protect his family at home and be out hunting at the same time. In the case of the claim that a provider male could buy protection service for his family from other males by [[barter]]ing food that he had hunted, critics point at the fact that the most valuable food (the food that contained the rarest essential nutrients) would be different in different ecologies and as such vegetable in some geographical areas and animal in others, making it impossible for hunting styles relying on physical strength or risk taking to be universally of similar value in bartered food and instead making it inevitable that in some parts of Africa, food gathered with no need for major physical strength would be the most valuable to barter for protection. A contradiction between evolutionary psychology's claim of men needing to be more sexually visual than women for fast speed of assessing women's fertility than women needed to be able to assess the male's genes and its claim of male sexual jealousy guarding against infidelity is also pointed at, as it would be pointless for a male to be fast to assess female fertility if he needed to assess the risk of there being a jealous male mate and in that case his chances of defeating him before mating anyway (pointlessness of assessing one necessary condition faster than another necessary condition can possibly be assessed).<ref>WE Frankenhuis Environmental unpredictability, Encyclopedia of Evolutionary Psychological Science, 2016 - Springer</ref><ref>Douglas T Kenrick, VIadas Griskevicius, Omar Mahmoud The rational animal: How evolution made us smarter than we think, 2016</ref>\n\n===Standard social science model===\n{{Main article|Standard social science model}}\nEvolutionary psychology has been entangled in the larger philosophical and social science controversies related to the debate on [[nature versus nurture]].

The discipline is generally not focused on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations).

It is also the smallest official language of the [[European Union|EU]] in terms of speakers, and the only official Semitic language within the EU. [[Cypriot Maronite Arabic]] (also known as Cypriot Arabic) is a [[varieties of Arabic|variety of Arabic]] spoken by [[Maronite]]s in [[Cyprus]]. Most speakers live in [[Nicosia]], but others are in the communities of [[Kormakiti]] and [[Limassol|Lemesos]]. Brought to the island by Maronites fleeing [[Lebanon]] over 700 years ago, this variety of Arabic has been influenced by [[Greek language|Greek]] in both [[phonology]] and [[vocabulary]], while retaining certain unusually archaic features in other respects.\n\n== History of standardization ==\n{{see|Ethnic groups in Europe#History|Vernacular|De vulgari eloquentia}}\n\n=== Language and identity, standardization processes ===\nIn the Middle Ages the two most important defining elements of Europe were ''Christianitas'' and ''Latinitas''. Thus language\u2014at least the supranational language\u2014played an elementary role{{Clarify|date=July 2010}}.\nThe earliest dictionaries were glossaries, i.e.,&nbsp;more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) ''[[Abrogans]]'' was among the first. A new wave of [[lexicography]] can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the printing press, with the growing interest in standardizing languages).\n\nThe concept of the [[nation state]] begins to emerge in the [[early modern period]]. Nations adopted particular dialects as their national language. This, together with improved communications, led to official efforts to standardise the [[national language]], and a number of language academies were established (e.g.,&nbsp;1582 ''[[Accademia della Crusca]]'' in Florence, 1617 ''[[Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft]]'' in Weimar, 1635 ''[[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]'' in Paris, 1713 ''[[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]]'' in Madrid). Language became increasingly linked to nation as opposed to culture, and was also used to promote religious and ethnic identity (e.g.,&nbsp;different [[Bible translations]] in the same language for Catholics and Protestants).\n\nThe first languages for which standardisation was promoted included Italian (''questione della lingua'': Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian \u2192 Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (the standard is based on Parisian), English (the standard is based on the London dialect) and (High) German (based on the dialects of the chancellery of Meissen in Saxony, Middle German, and the chancellery of Prague in Bohemia (\"Common German\")). But several other nations also began to develop a standard variety in the 16th century.\n\n=== Lingua franca ===\nEurope has had a number of languages that were considered [[linguae francae]] over some ranges for some periods according to some historians. Typically in the rise of a national language the new language becomes a lingua franca to peoples in the range of the future nation until the consolidation and unification phases. If the nation becomes internationally influential, its language may become a lingua franca among nations that speak their own national languages. Europe has had no lingua franca ranging over its entire territory spoken by all or most of its populations during any historical period. Some linguae francae of past and present over some of its regions for some of its populations are:\n<!-- in national and chronological order -->\n* [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] and then [[Koine Greek]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean Basin]] from the [[Athenian empire]] to the [[eastern Roman Empire]], being replaced by [[Modern Greek]].\n* [[Koine Greek]] and [[Modern Greek]], in the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire]] and other parts of the Balkans south of the [[Jire\u010dek Line]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Review [untitled] of Ariadna Camariano-Cioran, Les Academies Princieres de Bucarest et de Jassy et leur Professeurs |journal=Church History |volume=45 |number=1 |date = March 1976|pages=115\u2013116 |quote=...Greek, the ''lingua franca'' of commerce and religion, provided a cultural unity to the Balkans...Greek penetrated Moldavian and Wallachian territories as early as the fourteenth century....

States and populations within a state have often resorted to war to settle their differences.

Another European treaty, the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]], was adopted in 1992 under the auspices of the [[Council of Europe]]: it entered into force in 1998, and while it is legally binding for 24 countries, [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Moldova]] and [[Russia]] have chosen to sign without ratifying the convention.\n\n=== Scripts ===\n[[File:Scripts of European national languages.png|thumb|300px|Alphabets used in national languages in Europe:\n{{legend|#008000|[[Greek alphabet|Greek]]}}\n{{legend|#008080|[[Greek alphabet|Greek]] & [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]}}\n{{legend|#000080|[[Latin alphabet|Latin]]}}\n{{legend|#800080|[[Latin alphabet|Latin]] & [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]}}\n{{legend|#FF0000|[[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]}}\n{{legend|#FF6600|[[Georgian script|Georgian]]}}\n{{legend|#FFCC00|[[Armenian script|Armenian]]}}]]\n<!--[[File:Scripts in Europe (1901).jpg|thumb|250px|Main alphabets used in Europe around 1900:\n{{legend|#84CFEE|outline=#ccc|[[Latin script]]: [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] variant}}\n{{legend|#F8D2D1|outline=#ccc|Latin script: [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] variant}}\n{{legend|#DAF6D0|outline=#ccc|[[Cyrillic script]]}}\n{{legend|#D4CAA7|outline=#ccc|[[Greek alphabet]]}}\n{{legend|#FEFF88|outline=#ccc|[[Arabic script]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffff|outline=#ccc|[[Clear script|Kalmyk]]\u2013[[Mongolian script]]}}\n]]-->\n \nThe main scripts used in Europe today are the [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]. \n\nThe [[Greek alphabet]] was derived from the [[Phoenician alphabet]], and Latin was derived from the Greek via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]. In the Early Middle Ages, [[Ogham]] was used in Ireland and [[runes]] (derived the Old Italic script) in Scandinavia. Both were replaced in general use by the Latin alphabet by the Late Middle Ages. The Cyrillic script was derived from the Greek with the first texts appearing around 940&nbsp;AD.\n\n{{See also|Antiqua\u2013Fraktur dispute}}\nAround 1900 there were mainly two typeface variants of the [[Latin alphabet]] used in Europe: [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] and [[Fraktur]]. Fraktur was used most for German, Estonian, Latvian, Norwegian and Danish whereas Antiqua was used for Italian, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese, English, Romanian, Swedish and Finnish. The Fraktur variant was banned by [[Hitler]] in 1941, having been described as \"[[Schwabacher]] Jewish letters\".<ref>[http://www.ligaturix.de/bormann.htm Facsimile of Bormann's Memorandum (in German)]<br />\nThe memorandum itself is typed in Antiqua, but the [[NSDAP]] [[letterhead]] is printed in Fraktur.<br />\"For general attention, on behalf of the F\u00fchrer, I make the following announcement:<br />It is wrong to regard or to describe the so\u2011called Gothic script as a German script. In reality, the so\u2011called Gothic script consists of Schwabach Jew letters. Just as they later took control of the newspapers, upon the introduction of printing the Jews residing in Germany took control of the printing presses and thus in Germany the Schwabach Jew letters were forcefully introduced.<br />Today the F\u00fchrer, talking with Herr Reichsleiter Amann and Herr Book Publisher Adolf M\u00fcller, has decided that in the future the Antiqua script is to be described as normal script. All printed materials are to be gradually converted to this normal script.

The University was acknowledged for its research in Automobile sector. It was the second institute of its kind in the [[Netherlands]], preceded only by the [[Delft University of Technology]]. It is located on its own campus in the center of Eindhoven, just north of the railway station. It is currently home to about 240 professors, 7200 students, 250 PDEng-students, 600 Ph.D. students, 200 post-doc students and 3000 regular employees. It supports about 100 student associations and 15 alumni associations.<ref>[http://w3.tue.nl/en/the_university/management/facts_and_figures/ TU/e: Facts and figures] URL accessed on 3 July 2006</ref> Yearly, the Eindhoven University of Technology produces almost 3000 scientific publications, 140 PhD-awards, and 40 patents.\n\nThe Eindhoven University of Technology is main participant in the technological top institutes DPI and [[Technological Topinstitute|M2i]]. One of its former students is [[Gerard Kleisterlee]], a former CEO of [[Philips]].\n\nThe university is in an area where several companies active in technology are doing their research, like [[Philips]], [[ASML Holding|ASML]] and [[DAF Trucks|DAF]]. The university maintains close contacts with most of these companies.\n\nAs of 29 April 2005, Prof.dr.ir. C.J. van Duijn has the position of rector magnificus.\n\nIn 2006, the university celebrated its 50th birthday.\n\nIn a 2003 European Commission report,<ref>[ftp://ftp.cordis.europa.eu/pub/indicators/docs/3rd_report_snaps10.pdf European Commission ranking of the 22 European universities with the highest scientific publication impact]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, (see  [http://cordis.europa.eu/indicators/third_report.htm cordis.europa.eu] for the full report)</ref> TU/e was ranked as 3rd among European research universities (after Cambridge and Oxford, at equality with TU Munich and thus making it the highest ranked Technical University in Europe), based on the impact of its scientific research.

As such its general structure and management is determined by the ''Wet op het Hoger Onderwijs en Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek'' (English: ''Law on Higher Education and Scientific Research''). Between that law and the statutes of the university itself, the management of the university is organized according to the following chart:<ref name=\"Organogram\">{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/organogram/ |title=Organogram |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=1 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831160432/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/organogram/ |archive-date=31 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Organogram of the management of the Eindhoven University of Technology.png|thumb|600px|Organization chart of the TU/e management]]\n\n===Executive college===\nThe day-to-day running of the university is in the hands of the Executive College (Dutch: ''College van Bestuur''). The College provides oversight for the departments, the service organizations and the Innovation Lab, plus the local activities of the [[Stan Ackermans Institute]]. The College consists of three people, plus a secretary:\n\n;The chairman: The chairman is the chairman of the college and the main face of the university to the outside world. Technically almost anybody can be chairman, as long as they have plenty of management experience. Over the last few years the post has been held by people from outside the university, chosen from industry top levels, in order to strengthen the ties between the university and industrial partners. The current chairman is ir. Jan Mengelers.\n;The rector magnificus: The [[rector magnificus]] is the one member of the College whose membership is mandated by law. The law allows the university to appoint a rector in any way, but the university statutes determine that the rector magnificus must be an active professor at the university (and must have been that before being appointed rector); in practice the rector is always a former department dean. The rector is the voice of the academic staff in the College and guards the academic interests of the university in the College. The current rector magnificus is [[Frank Baaijens]].\n;The third member: The third member is a \"tie-breaker\" member of the College. The post is open to anybody (but generally not filled by an academic staff member). The current third member is Jo van Ham.\n;The secretary: The secretary is not a member of the College but a university functionary who does secretarial work for the College: he keeps the minutes and the records, plus takes care of the communication between the College and the university (posting announcements and so on). The College secretary is usually the secretary for the entire university. The current secretary is dr. M.M.N. (Nicole) Ummelen.\n\n===Oversight of the executive college===\nThere are two bodies that provide oversight over the Executive College:\n\n* The Oversight Board is an external board of five people appointed by the Minister of Education (one member is appointed at the suggestion of the University Council). The Board provides external oversight of the running of the university, including changing of the statutes, the budget and other management decisions.\n* The University Council is a council of 18 people, half of whom are elected from the university staff (academic and otherwise) and half from the student body. The University Council is informed of the running of the university by the College at least twice a year and may advise the College as it sees fit. It guards against discrimination within the university. And the council must agree to changes in the management structure. The Council membership is open to all students and personnel, except those persons who are in the Oversight Board, the Executive College or who are the University Secretary.\n\n===Departments and service organizations===\nMost of the work at the university is done in the departments and the service organizations.\n\n* The [[#Departments|departments]] take care of most of the research and education at the university; each one is run by its professors, headed by the [[dean (education)|dean]]. The deans are all members of the executive deliberation meeting, which is a regular meeting of the deans and the rector.\n* The [[#Service organizations|service organizations]] provide services to the inhabitants of the university campus. Examples of these organizations include the housing organization, the ICT organization and the Communication Expertise Center (which does external communications, including to the press). Each service organization is headed by an organization head.\n\nBoth for the departments and the service organizations, the staff (and students) are involved with the running of the body. For that reason both types of bodies have advisory councils which have advisory and co-decision authorities.\n\n===TU/e Holding B.V.===\nOver the past two decades, the TU/e has increasingly developed commercial interests and off-campus ties. These include commercial agreements and contracts directly between the university and external companies, but also interests in [[#Spinoffs|spinoff companies]]. In order to manage these kinds of contractual obligations the university started the TU/e Holding B.V. in 1997. The Holding is a [[limited company]], dedicated to the commercial exploitation of scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"TUEHolding\">{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/tue_holding_bv/ |title=TU/e Holding B.V. |publisher=TU/e |language=Dutch |accessdate=1 October 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814152457/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/de_universiteit/tue_holding_bv |archive-date=14 August 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Education==\n\n===Departments===\nThe scientific departments (or [[faculty (division)|faculties]]; Dutch: ''faculteiten'') are the primary vehicles for teaching and research in the university. They employ the majority of the academic staff, are responsible for teaching and sponsor the research schools and institutions.\n\nThe vast majority of education is undergraduate education provided by the departments to students, who are adults with no other academic qualifications than a secondary education diploma. Some education is also provided to members of the postgraduate designer programs, but they are employed by the university and do not count as part of the student body.\n\nUndergraduate education was given in four- or five-year programs until 2002, styled along the lines of the German system of education; graduates of these programs were granted an engineering title and allowed to prefix their name with the title ''ir.'' (an abbreviation of ingenieur; not to be confused with graduates of technical ''hogescholen'', who were engineers abbreviated ''ing.''). Starting in 2002, following the entry into force of the [[Bologna Process|Bologna Accords]], the university switched to the bachelor/master structure (students graduating in 2002 were given both an old-style engineering title and a new master's title). The undergraduate programs are now split into two programs each, a three-year bachelor program and a two-year master program. These programs are completely independent, in the sense that a bachelor can leave the university with his title and go to work, can enter a master's program at another university or continue on to the master's program of his department at the university. Of course bachelors from other universities can also enroll in the new master's programs.\n\nThe departments also offer Ph.D programs (Dutch: ''promotiefase'') whereby a qualified master may earn a Ph.D. Unlike in [[anglo-saxon]] countries these are not educational programs, however; rather, a person working towards promotion is a [[research assistant]], employed by the department, with teaching responsibilities in addition to his research work.\n\nThe TU/e has nine departments:\n* [[Biomedical Engineering]]\n* [[Architectural engineering|Built Environment]]\n* [[Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[Industrial Design]]\n* [[Chemical Engineering]] and [[Chemistry]]\n* [[Industrial Engineering]] & Innovation Sciences (formerly [[Technology Management]])\n* [[Applied Physics]]\n* [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]]\n\n====Honors programs====\nThe university offers two honors programs for \"top students\": students who have proven to have a knack for studying, have the capacity to handle a higher academic load and have an interest in more depth in their programs. There are two honors programs, both aimed at the bachelor students:<ref name=\"HorizonGeneral\">{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/daz/honors_program/ |title=Honors program |publisher=TU/e |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120160335/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/daz/honors_program/ |archive-date=20 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n;Honors Horizon: The Honors Horizon program (started in September 2006) is aimed at bachelor students who are interested in introducing a [[multidisciplinary]] component into their program. Honors Horizon is intended to \"expand students' horizon\", by offering multidisciplinary honors classes, research activities and other activities that encourage academic well-roundedness. The Horizon project is an addition to the second and third years of the bachelor program.<ref name=\"HonorsHorizon\">{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/daz/honors_program/honors_horizon/#c115269 |title=Honors Horizon program |publisher=TU/e |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201404/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/daz/honors_program/honors_horizon/#c115269 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n;Honors Star: The Honors Star program (started in September 2010) is complementary to the Horizon program; where Horizon is multidisciplinary, Star is aimed at providing more depth within the program of the student's own department. Activities are still being fleshed out, but are expected to include more in-depth questions in exams and more practical projects. The Star program is an addition to the full duration of the bachelor program.<ref name=\"HonorsStar\">{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/daz/honors_program/honors_star/#c115268 |title=Honors Star program |publisher=TU/e |language=Dutch |accessdate=30 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201423/http://w3.tue.nl/nl/diensten/daz/honors_program/honors_star/#c115268 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nQualifying students can choose between the Honors programs, or follow both at the same time.\n\n====Shared minors====\nAs of September 2010 the university offers bachelors in their third year a [[minor (Academic)|minor]] on [[sustainable energy]]. This minor will focus on providing students with skills needed to work in the sustainable energy industry, or to start their own company in this industry. For that reason the minor is driven entirely by problems supplied by industry and knowledge institutes, which minor students must solve in multidisciplinary teams. In addition, students must come up with an innovative plan and develop a start-up company.<ref name=\"MinorSustainable\">{{Citation | year = 2010 | title = Nieuws:Onderwijs | periodical = Matrix, kwartaalblad van de Technische Universiteit Eindhoven | publication-place = Eindhoven | publisher = Eindhoven University of Technology | volume = 17 | issue = Fall 2010 | page = 15 | issn = 1380-247X }}<!--| accessdate =30 September 2010--></ref>\n\n===Postgraduate designer programs (PDEng) ===\nThe university started a number of postgraduate designer programs (PDEng) together with the other Dutch technological universities (TU Delft and University of Twente) in 1986.

These include the teacher's program and an MBA program.\n\n*[[Eindhoven School of Education]]: Teacher's education for masters, to get their higher education teaching certificate. Also does research into educational sciences and innovation in education.\n*[[TIAS School for Business and Society]]: A shared [[MBA]] program with the [[University of Tilburg]], for university graduates.\n*HBO minor program: Bachelor programs for students of HBO universities (four-year bachelor programs), to allow them access to university master programs.\n\n==Research==\nThe TU/e participates in a large number of research institutes which balance in different ways between pure science and applied science research. Some of these institutes are bound strictly to the university, others combine research across different universities. \n\n===Top in research partnerships with industry===\nThe TU/e is among the world\u2019s ten best-performing research universities in terms of research cooperation with industry in 2011 (Number 1 in 2009). Ten to 20 percent of the scientific publications of these ten universities in the period 2006\u20132008 were the result of partnerships with researchers in industry. As well as TU/e and Delft University of Technology, the top 10 also includes two universities in Japan (Tokyo Institute of Technology and Keio University in Tokyo), two in Sweden (CTH Chalmers University of Technology and KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm), and one each in Denmark (DTU Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby), Finland (University of Helsinki), Norway (Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim) and the USA (Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tue.nl/en/university/news-and-press/news/tue-among-world-top-in-research-partnerships-with-industry/ |title=TU/e among world top in research partnerships with industry |publisher=Tue.nl |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-04}}</ref>\n\n==Off-campus activities==\nThe TU/e plays a central role in the academic, [[economy|economic]] and [[society|social]] life of [[Eindhoven]] and the surrounding region. In addition the university maintains relations with institutions far beyond that region as well and participates in national and international events (sometimes through the student body).\n\n===Economic and research motor===\nThe TU/e is enormously important to the economy of the [[Eindhoven]] region, as well as the wider areas of [[BrabantStad]] and the [[Samenwerkingsverband Regio Eindhoven]]. It provides highly skilled labor for the local [[knowledge economy]] and is a knowledge and research partner for technology companies in the area.\n\nThe historic basis for the university's role as an economy and research motor was the interaction with [[Philips]]. The university was founded primarily to address the need of Philips for local personnel with academic levels of education in [[electronics]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and later [[computer science]]. Later that interest spread to [[DAF Trucks|DAF]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]] (which became the primary employer for graduates of the chemistry department). There was also a synergy with these companies in that senior personnel were hired from them to form the academic staff of the university (which led to the Eindhoven joke that the university trains the engineers and Philips trains the professors).\n\nChanging economic times and business strategies changed the relationship during the 1980s and 1990s. As Philips started moving away from the region, its importance to the region and the university decreased. A struggle for economic survival forced the university to seek closer ties with the city and region of Eindhoven in the 1989\u20131995 period, resulting in the creation of the [[Brainport (Eindhoven)|Brainport]] initiative to draw high tech business and industry to the region. The university started expending more effort in knowledge [[valorisation]], in incubating technology startups, in providing direct knowledge support for local technology companies. Also the academic interests of the research shifted with the times, with more effort going into energy efficiency research, green technologies, and other areas of interest driven by social relevance (the call for better technology in the medical field, for example, led to cooperation with the [[Catharina Hospital (Eindhoven)|Catharina Hospital]] and the [[University of Maastricht]] medical department and finally the creation of the Biomedical Technology department).\n\nThe TU/e is host (and in some cases also commissioner) of a number of highly successful research schools, including the [[Eindhoven Embedded Systems Institute|ESI]] and the [[Dutch Polymer Institute|DPI]]. These research institutes are a source of high-tech knowledge for high-tech companies in the area, such as [[ASML Holding|ASML]], [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP]] and [[FEI Company|FEI]]. The university also plays a large role as knowledge and personnel supplier to other companies in the [[High Tech Campus Eindhoven]] and helps incubate startups through the Eindhoven [[Twinning Center]]. It is also a knowledge supporter of the [[automotive]] industry in the [[Helmond]] region.\n\nIn the extended region, the TU/e is part of the backbone of the Eindhoven-Leuven-Aachen triangle.<ref name=\"ELAt\">[http://www.elat.org ELAt.org] The ELAt website</ref> This economic cooperation agreement between three cities in three countries has created one of the most innovative regions in the [[European Union]] (measured in terms of money invested in technology and knowledge economy); the agreement is based on the cooperative triangle that connects the three technical universities in those cities.\n\n====Eindhoven Energy Institute====\nAs of the summer of 2010, the TU/e is host to the Eindhoven Energy Institute (EEI). The EEI is a virtual research institute (meaning that it doesn't have any actual offices or facilities), which manages and coordinates the activities of a large number of groups and subinstitutes in the general area of sustainable and alternative energy technologies.<ref name=\"EEIOverview\">{{cite web |url=http://w3.tue.nl/en/the_university/research/research_schools_and_institutes/eindhoven_energy_institute/this_is_eei/ |title=This is EEI |publisher=TU/e |accessdate=21 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514120650/http://w3.tue.nl/en/the_university/research/research_schools_and_institutes/eindhoven_energy_institute/this_is_eei |archive-date=14 May 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe scientific director of the institute is prof.dr.ir. David Smeulders. He is pro forma head of the research department, which is split into four key areas: ''Built Environment'' (energy usage and patterns in building, headed by prof.dr.ir. Jan Hensen from the Department of the Built Environment), ''Future Fuels'' (headed by prof.dr. Philip de Goey of Mechanical Engineering), ''Energy Conversion'' (headed by prof.dr.ir. [[Ren\u00e9 Janssen]] from Chemical Engineering) and ''Fusion and Plasma'' (headed by prof.dr. Niek Lopes Cardozo from Physics). The EEI also incorporates the Graduate School on Sustainable Energy, which the TU/e had already established together with the [[Technical University Munich|TU Munich]] and [[Technical University of Denmark|DTU Lyngby]]. Secretarial services will be provided by the Center Technology for Sustainable Development (TDO) which also already existed at the TU/e (since 1994).<ref name=\"MatrixEEI\">{{cite web |url= http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/csc/matrix/matrix2010_2.pdf |title= Matrix, the TU/e quarterly publication, summer edition 2010 |access-date= 21 September 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201212/http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/csc/matrix/matrix2010_2.pdf |archive-date= 17 July 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(2.3Mb; p.4-7)}}</ref>\n\nEnergy research at the TU/e is among the best in academic Europe (a February 2010 study by Reed Elsevier puts it second only to [[Imperial College London]]).<ref name=\"ReedElsevierResearch\">{{cite web |url= http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/nieuws_tue/2010/03/Q2226.SciVal.Spt.Alternative_Energy_ReportV3.pdf |title= Alternative Energy Leadership Study |access-date= 21 September 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110717201257/http://w3.tue.nl/fileadmin/nieuws_tue/2010/03/Q2226.SciVal.Spt.Alternative_Energy_ReportV3.pdf |archive-date= 17 July 2011 |dead-url= yes |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(1.6Mb)}}</ref> This fact, as well as the unique attention to energy in the built-up environment, drew the attention of the [[European Institute of Innovation and Technology]].

In 2009 the university employed 37 foreign professors (15.9% of the total) and 16 foreign associate professors (12.8%). Overall, 29.5% of the university staff was non-Dutch.\n\nIn 2011/2012, the TU/e has Erasmus bilateral agreements with many universities in 30 countries across Europe in a diverse range of subjects for student exchange.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tue.nl/en/education/exchange-programs/erasmus-and-leonardo-program/partner-institutions/ |title=Partner institutions |publisher=Tue.nl |date=2011-02-23 |accessdate=2013-06-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524223410/http://www.tue.nl/en/education/exchange-programs/erasmus-and-leonardo-program/partner-institutions/ |archive-date=24 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Technological sports===\nIn addition to the \"regular\" types of sports practiced among the student body and by the staff, the TU/e collaborates with the student body in a number of \"technology sporting efforts\".

Electronegativity cannot be directly measured and must be calculated from other atomic or molecular properties. Several methods of calculation have been proposed, and although there may be small differences in the numerical values of the electronegativity, all methods show the same [[periodic trends]] between [[Chemical element|elements]].\n\nThe most commonly used method of calculation is that originally proposed by Linus Pauling. This gives a [[dimensionless quantity]], commonly referred to as the '''Pauling scale''' (''\u03c7''<sub>r</sub>), on a relative scale running from around 0.7 to 3.98 ([[hydrogen]]&nbsp;= 2.20). When other methods of calculation are used, it is conventional (although not obligatory) to quote the results on a scale that covers the same range of numerical values: this is known as an electronegativity in ''Pauling units''.\n\nAs it is usually calculated, electronegativity is not a property of an atom alone, but rather a property of an atom in a [[molecule]].<ref name=\"NOTCB\">{{cite book|author=Pauling, Linus|year=1960|title=Nature of the Chemical Bond|publisher=Cornell University Press|pages=88\u2013107|isbn=978-0-8014-0333-0}}</ref> Properties of a free atom include [[ionization energy]] and [[electron affinity]].

[[Francium]] and caesium were originally both assigned 0.7; caesium's value was later refined to 0.79, but no experimental data allows a similar refinement for francium. However, francium's [[ionization energy]] is known to be slightly higher than caesium's, in accordance with the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilization of the 7s [[atomic orbital|orbital]], and this in turn implies that francium is in fact more electronegative than caesium.<ref>More details and sources for this point can be found in the article on [[francium]].</ref>\n\n==Electronegativities of the elements==\n{{Periodic table (electronegativity by Pauling scale)}}\n\n==Methods of calculation==\n\n===Pauling electronegativity===\n[[Linus Pauling|Pauling]] first proposed<ref name=\"paulingJACS\"/> the concept of electronegativity in 1932 as an explanation of the fact that the [[covalent bond]] between two different atoms (A\u2013B) is stronger than would be expected by taking the average of the strengths of the A\u2013A and B\u2013B bonds. According to [[valence bond theory]], of which Pauling was a notable proponent, this \"additional stabilization\" of the [[heteronuclear]] bond is due to the contribution of [[Ionic bond|ionic]]  [[Resonance (chemistry)|canonical form]]s to the bonding.\n\nThe difference in electronegativity between atoms A and B is given by:\n::<math>|\\chi_{\\rm A} - \\chi_{\\rm B}| = ({\\rm eV})^{-1/2} \\sqrt{E_{\\rm d}({\\rm AB}) - [E_{\\rm d}({\\rm AA}) + E_{\\rm d}({\\rm BB})]/2}</math>\nwhere the [[Bond dissociation energy|dissociation energies]], ''E''<sub>d</sub>, of the A\u2013B, A\u2013A and B\u2013B bonds are expressed in [[electronvolt]]s, the factor (eV)<sup>\u2212{{frac|1|2}}</sup> being included to ensure a dimensionless result. Hence, the difference in Pauling electronegativity between hydrogen and [[bromine]] is 0.73 (dissociation energies: H\u2013Br, 3.79&nbsp;eV; H\u2013H, 4.52&nbsp;eV; Br\u2013Br 2.00&nbsp;eV)\n\nAs only differences in electronegativity are defined, it is necessary to choose an arbitrary reference point in order to construct a scale. Hydrogen was chosen as the reference, as it forms covalent bonds with a large variety of elements: its electronegativity was fixed first<ref name=\"paulingJACS\"/> at 2.1, later revised<ref name=\"Allred\">{{cite journal\n |author= Allred, A. L.\n |year= 1961\n |journal= Journal of Inorganic and Nuclear Chemistry\n |volume= 17\n |issue= 3\u20134\n |pages= 215\u2013221\n |title= Electronegativity values from thermochemical data\n |doi= 10.1016/0022-1902(61)80142-5}}</ref> to 2.20. It is also necessary to decide which of the two elements is the more electronegative (equivalent to choosing one of the two possible signs for the square root). This is usually done using \"chemical intuition\": in the above example, [[hydrogen bromide]] dissolves in water to form H<sup>+</sup> and Br<sup>\u2212</sup> ions, so it may be assumed that bromine is more electronegative than hydrogen. However, in principle, since the same electronegativities should be obtained for any two bonding compounds, the data are in fact overdetermined, and the signs are unique once a reference point is fixed (usually, for H or F).\n\nTo calculate Pauling electronegativity for an element, it is necessary to have data on the dissociation energies of at least two types of covalent bond formed by that element. A. L. Allred updated Pauling's original values in 1961 to take account of the greater availability of thermodynamic data,<ref name=\"Allred\"/> and it is these \"revised Pauling\" values of the electronegativity that are most often used.\n\nThe essential point of Pauling electronegativity is that there is an underlying, quite accurate, semi-empirical formula for dissociation energies, namely:\n\n::<math>E_{\\rm d}({\\rm AB}) =[E_{\\rm d}({\\rm AA}) + E_{\\rm d}({\\rm BB})]/2+(\\chi_{\\rm A} - \\chi_{\\rm B})^2 {\\rm eV}</math>\nor sometimes, a more accurate fit\n::<math>E_{\\rm d}({\\rm AB}) =\\sqrt{E_{\\rm d}({\\rm AA}) E_{\\rm d}({\\rm BB})}+1.3(\\chi_{\\rm A} - \\chi_{\\rm B})^2 {\\rm eV}</math>\n\nThis is an approximate equation, but holds with good accuracy. Pauling obtained it by noting that a bond can be approximately represented as a quantum mechanical superposition of a covalent bond and two ionic bond-states. The covalent energy of a bond is approximately, by quantum mechanical calculations, the [[geometric mean]] of the two energies of covalent bonds of the same molecules, and there is an additional energy that comes from ionic factors, i.e. polar character of the bond.\n\nThe geometric mean is approximately equal to the [[arithmetic mean]] - which is applied in the first formula above - when the energies are of the similar value, e.g., except for the highly electropositive elements, where there is a larger difference of two dissociation energies; the geometric mean is more accurate and almost always gives a positive excess energy, due to ionic bonding.  The square root of this excess energy, Pauling notes, is approximately additive, and hence one can introduce the electronegativity. Thus, it is this semi-empirical formula for bond energy that underlies Pauling electronegativity concept.\n\nThe formulas are approximate, but this rough approximation is in fact relatively good and gives the right intuition, with the notion of polarity of the bond and some theoretical grounding in quantum mechanics. The electronegativities are then determined to best fit the data.\n\nIn more complex compounds, there is additional error since electronegativity depends on the molecular environment of an atom. Also, the energy estimate can be only used for single, not for multiple bonds. The energy of formation of a molecule containing only single bonds then can be approximated from an electronegativity table, and depends on the constituents and sum of squares of differences of electronegativities of all pairs of bonded atoms. Such a formula for estimating energy typically has relative error of order of 10%, but can be used to get a rough qualitative idea and understanding of a molecule.\n\n===Mulliken electronegativity===\n[[Image:Pauling and Mullikan electronegativities.png|thumb|right|The correlation between Mulliken electronegativities (''x''-axis, in kJ/mol) and Pauling electronegativities (''y''-axis).]]\n[[Robert S.

The necessary data are available for almost all elements, and this method allows the estimation of electronegativities for elements that cannot be treated by the other methods, e.g. [[francium]], which has an Allen electronegativity of 0.67.<ref name=\"Fr\">The widely quoted Pauling electronegativity of 0.7 for francium is an extrapolated value of uncertain provenance.

The most obvious application of electronegativities is in the discussion of [[bond polarity]], for which the concept was introduced by Pauling. In general, the greater the difference in electronegativity between two atoms the more polar the bond that will be formed between them, with the atom having the higher electronegativity being at the negative end of the dipole. Pauling proposed an equation to relate \"ionic character\" of a bond to the difference in electronegativity of the two atoms,<ref name=\"NOTCB\"/> although this has fallen somewhat into disuse.\n\nSeveral correlations have been shown between [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared stretching frequencies]] of certain bonds and the electronegativities of the atoms involved:<ref>See, e.g., {{cite book|author=Bellamy, L. J. |year=1958 |title=The Infra-Red Spectra of Complex Molecules|location=New York|publisher= Wiley|page=392|isbn=978-0-412-13850-8}}</ref> however, this is not surprising as such stretching frequencies depend in part on bond strength, which enters into the calculation of Pauling electronegativities. More convincing are the correlations between electronegativity and chemical shifts in [[NMR spectroscopy]]<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Spieseke, H. |author2=Schneider, W.

Both these measurements depend on the s-electron density at the nucleus, and so are a good indication that the different measures of electronegativity really are describing \"the ability of an atom in a molecule to attract electrons to itself\".<ref name=\"definition\"/><ref name=\"NOTCB\"/>\n\n==Trends in electronegativity==\n\n===Periodic trends===\n[[Image:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|right|The variation of Pauling electronegativity (''y''-axis) as one descends the main groups of the periodic table from the second period to the sixth period]]\nIn general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, [[fluorine]] is the most electronegative of the elements (not counting [[noble gas]]es), whereas [[caesium]]<!-- not francium; please don't change unless you supply a citation for published experimental results --> is the least electronegative, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.<ref name=\"Fr\"/> This would lead one to believe that [[caesium fluoride]] is the [[Chemical compound|compound]] whose bonding features the most ionic character.\n\nThere are some exceptions to this general rule. [[Gallium]] and [[germanium]] have higher electronegativities than [[aluminium]] and [[silicon]], respectively, because of the [[d-block contraction]]. Elements of the [[Period 4 element|fourth period]] immediately after the first row of the transition metals have unusually small atomic radii because the 3d-electrons are not effective at shielding the increased nuclear charge, and smaller atomic size correlates with higher electronegativity (see [[#Allred\u2013Rochow electronegativity|Allred-Rochow electronegativity]], [[#Sanderson electronegativity|Sanderson electronegativity]] above). The anomalously high electronegativity of [[lead]], in particular when compared to [[thallium]] and [[bismuth]], appears to be an artifact of data selection (and data availability)\u2014methods of calculation other than the Pauling method show the normal periodic trends for these elements.\n\n===Variation of electronegativity with oxidation number===\nIn inorganic chemistry it is common to consider a single value of the electronegativity to be valid for most \"normal\" situations. While this approach has the advantage of simplicity, it is clear that the electronegativity of an element is ''not'' an invariable atomic property and, in particular, increases with the [[oxidation state]] of the element.\n\nAllred used the Pauling method to calculate separate electronegativities for different oxidation states of the handful of elements (including tin and lead) for which sufficient data was available.<ref name=\"Allred\"/> However, for most elements, there are not enough different covalent compounds for which bond dissociation energies are known to make this approach feasible. This is particularly true of the transition elements, where quoted electronegativity values are usually, of necessity, averages over several different oxidation states and where trends in electronegativity are harder to see as a result.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

Hence [[Chromium trioxide|CrO<sub>3</sub>]] and [[Dimanganese heptoxide|Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>]] are [[acidic oxide]]s with low [[melting point]]s, while [[Chromium(III) oxide|Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]] is [[amphoteric oxide|amphoteric]] and [[Manganese(III) oxide|Mn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>]] is a completely [[basic oxide]].\n\nThe effect can also be clearly seen in the [[Acid dissociation constant|dissociation constants]] of the [[oxoacid]]s of [[chlorine]]. The effect is much larger than could be explained by the negative charge being shared among a larger number of oxygen atoms, which would lead to a difference in p''K''<sub>a</sub> of log<sub>10</sub>({{frac|1|4}})&nbsp;= \u20130.6 between [[hypochlorous acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. As the oxidation state of the central chlorine atom increases, more electron density is drawn from the oxygen atoms onto the chlorine, reducing the partial negative charge on the oxygen atoms and increasing the acidity.\n\n=== Electronegativity and hybridization scheme ===\nThe electronegativity of an atom changes depending on the hybridization of the orbital employed in bonding.  Electrons in s orbitals are held more tightly than electrons in p orbitals.  Hence, a bond to an atom that employs an sp''<sup>x</sup>'' hybrid orbital for bonding will be more heavily polarized to that atom when the hybrid orbital has more s character.  That is, when electronegativities are compared for different hybridization schemes of a given element, the order \u03c7(sp<sup>3</sup>) < \u03c7(sp<sup>2</sup>) < \u03c7(sp) holds (the trend should apply to [[Isovalent hybridization|non-integer hybridization indices]] as well).  While this holds true in principle for any main-group element, values for the hybridization-specific electronegativity are most frequently cited for carbon. In organic chemistry, these electronegativities are frequently invoked to predict or rationalize bond polarities in organic compounds containing double and triple bonds to carbon.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

The terms '''group electronegativity''' and '''substituent electronegativity''' are used synonymously. However, it is common to distinguish between the [[inductive effect]] and the [[resonance effect]], which might be described as \u03c3- and \u03c0-electronegativities, respectively. There are a number of [[linear free-energy relationship]]s that have been used to quantify these effects, of which the [[Hammett equation]] is the best known. [[Kabachnik parameter]]s are group electronegativities for use in [[organophosphorus chemistry]].\n\n==Electropositivity==\n'''Electropositivity''' is a measure of an element's ability to donate [[electrons]], and therefore form positive [[ions]]; thus, it is opposed to electronegativity.\n\nMainly, this is an attribute of [[metals]], meaning that, in general, the greater the metallic character of an [[chemical element|element]] the greater the electropositivity. Therefore, the [[alkali metals]] are most electropositive of all. This is because they have a single electron in their outer shell and, as this is relatively far from the nucleus of the atom, it is easily lost; in other words, these metals have low [[ionization energy|ionization energies]].<ref>\"[https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpIKRbL?url=http://au.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_781538810/Electropositivity.html Electropositivity],\" [[Microsoft Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia 2009.

The preparation for the charter was undertaken by the predecessor to the current [[Congress of Local and Regional Authorities of the Council of Europe|Congress of Local and Regional Authorities]], the Standing Conference of Local and Regional Authorities of Europe because involvement of local and regional government was essential. The actual charter was written in the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] based on the Congress' Recommendations. It only applies to [[language]]s traditionally used by the nationals of the State Parties (thus excluding languages used by recent [[immigrant]]s from other states, see [[immigrant language]]s), which significantly differ from the majority or [[official language]] (thus excluding what the state party wishes to consider as mere local dialects of the official or majority language) and that either have a territorial basis (and are therefore traditionally spoken by populations of regions or areas within the State) or are used by linguistic minorities within the State as a whole (thereby including such languages as [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Romani language|Romani]] and [[Lemko language| Lemko]], which are used over a wide geographic area).\n\nSome states, such as Ukraine and Sweden, have tied the status of minority language to the recognized national minorities, which are defined by ethnic, cultural and/or religious criteria, thereby circumventing the Charter's notion of linguistic minority.<ref>Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.</ref> \n\nLanguages that are official within regions, provinces or federal units within a State (for example [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in [[Spain]]) are not classified as official languages of the State and may therefore benefit from the Charter. On the other hand, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has not been able to sign the Charter on behalf of the [[Irish language]] (although a minority language) as it is defined as the first official language of the state. The [[United Kingdom]] has ratified the Charter in respect to (among other languages) [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Wales]] and [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|Irish]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. [[France]], although a signatory, has been constitutionally blocked from ratifying the Charter in respect to the [[languages of France]].\n\nThe charter provides a large number of different actions state parties can take to protect and promote historical regional and minority languages. There are two levels of protection&mdash;all signatories must apply the lower level of protection to qualifying languages. Signatories may further declare that a qualifying language or languages will benefit from the higher level of protection, which lists a range of actions from which states must agree to undertake at least 35.\n\n==Protections==\nCountries can ratify the charter in respect of its minority languages based on Part II or Part III of the charter, which contain varying principles. Countries can treat languages differently under the charter, for example, in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Welsh language]] is ratified under the general Part II principles as well as the more specific Part III commitments, while the [[Cornish language]] is ratified only under Part II.\n\n===Part II===\nPart II of the Charter details eight main principles and objectives upon which States must base their policies and legislation. They are seen as a framework for the preservation of the languages concerned.<ref name=\"about\">{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/aboutcharter/default_en.asp|title=The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages is the European convention for the protection and promotion of languages used by traditional minorities.|website=European Charter for Regional <br>or Minority Languages}}</ref>\n*Recognition of regional or minority languages as an expression of cultural wealth.\n*Respect for the geographical area of each regional or minority language.\n*The need for resolute action to promote such languages.\n*The facilitation and/or encouragement of the use of such languages, in speech and writing, in public and private life.\n*The provision of appropriate forms and means for the teaching and study of such languages at all appropriate stages.\n*The promotion of relevant transnational exchanges.\n*The prohibition of all forms of unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference relating to the use of a regional or minority language and intended to discourage or endanger its maintenance or development.\n*The promotion by states of mutual understanding between all the country\u2019s linguistic groups.\n\n===Part III===\nPart III details comprehensive rules across a number of sectors, that states agree to abide by.

series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\"[[Roundhead]]s\") and Royalists (\"[[Cavalier]]s\") over, principally, the manner of England's governance. The [[First English Civil War|first]] (1642\u20131646) and [[Second English Civil War|second]] (1648\u20131649) wars pitted the supporters of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] against the supporters of the [[Long Parliament]], while the [[Third English Civil War|third]] (1649\u20131651) saw fighting between supporters of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] and supporters of the [[Rump Parliament]]. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the [[Battle of Worcester]] on 3 September 1651.\n\nThe overall outcome of the war was threefold: [[High Court of Justice for the trial of Charles I|the trial]] and [[execution of Charles I]] (1649); the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); and the replacement of [[English monarchy]] with, at first, the [[Commonwealth of England]] (1649\u20131653) and then [[the Protectorate]] under the personal rule of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1653\u20131658) and subsequently his son [[Richard Cromwell|Richard]] (1658\u20131659). In England, the monopoly of the [[Church of England]] on Christian worship was ended, while in Ireland the victors consolidated the established [[Protestant Ascendancy]]. Constitutionally, the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s consent, although the idea of [[Parliamentary sovereignty|Parliament as the ruling power of England]] was only legally established as part of the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688.{{sfn|EB staff|2016a}}\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"English Civil War\" appears most often in the singular form, although historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. These wars were not restricted to [[England]] as [[Wales]] was a part of the Kingdom of England and was affected accordingly, and the conflicts also involved wars with, and civil wars within, both [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. The war in all these countries is known as the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the early 19th century, [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]] referred to it as \"the Great Civil War.\"<ref>Walter Scott, ''Waverley; or, 'Tis Sixty Years Since'' (1814), Chap. 2.</ref>\n\nUnlike other [[List of English civil wars|civil wars in England]], which focused on who should rule, this war was more concerned with the manner in which the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]] were governed. The [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'']] called the series of conflicts the \"Great Rebellion\",{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} while some historians{{spaced ndash}}especially [[Marxist]]s such as [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (1912\u20132003){{spaced ndash}}have long favoured the term \"[[English Revolution]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Hill|1972|loc=for example}}.</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe two sides had their geographical strongholds, such that minority elements were silenced or fled. The strongholds of the royalty included the countryside, the shires, and the less economically developed areas of northern and western England. On the other hand, all the [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral cities]] (except York, Chester, Worcester and Hereford and the royalist stronghold of Oxford) sided with Parliament. All the industrial centers, the ports, and the economically advanced regions of southern and eastern England typically were parliamentary strongholds. Lacey Baldwin Smith says, \"the words ''populous, rich, and rebellious'' seemed to go hand in hand\".{{sfn|Smith|1983|p=251}}{{sfn|Hughes|1985|pp=236\u201363}}\n\n==Strategy and tactics==\nMany of the officers and veteran soldiers of the English Civil War studied and implemented war strategies that had been learned and perfected in other wars across Europe, namely by the Spanish and the Dutch during the [[Eighty Years' War|Dutch war for independence]] which began in 1568.{{sfn|Baker|1986|p= }}\n\nThe main battle tactic came to be known as [[pike and shot]] infantry, in which the two sides would line up, facing each other, with infantry brigades of [[musketeer]]s in the centre, carrying matchlock muskets; these muskets were inaccurate, but could be lethal at a range of up to 300 yards. The brigades would arrange themselves in lines of musketeers, three deep, where the first row would kneel, the second would crouch, and the third would stand, allowing all three to fire a volley simultaneously.<ref name=\"Simkin\">{{cite web|author=John Simkin |title=The English Civil War \u2013 Tactics |orig-year=originally September 1997 |date= August 2014 |access-date=20 April 2015 |url=http://spartacus-educational.com/STUcivilwarMT.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational}}{{better source|date=April 2015}}</ref> At times there would be two groups of three lines allowing one group to reload while the other group arranged themselves and fired.{{sfn|Burne|Young|1998|p= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}} Mixed in among the musketeers were pikemen carrying [[pike (weapon)|pikes]] that were between {{convert|12|ft|m|0}} and {{convert|18|ft|m|0}} long, whose primary purpose was to protect the musketeers from cavalry charges. Positioned on each side of the infantry were the cavalry, with a right-wing led by the lieutenant-general, and a left-wing by the commissary general; the main goal of the cavalry was to rout the opponent's cavalry and then turn and overpower their infantry.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /><ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Gaunt |title=The English Civil War: A Military History |year=2014 |location=London |publisher=I.B. Tauris |oclc=882915214 |postscript=. }}</ref>{{Page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nThe Royalist cavaliers' skill and speed on horseback led to many early victories. Prince Rupert, the leader of the king's cavalry, learned a tactic while fighting in the Dutch army where the cavalry would charge at full speed into the opponent's infantry firing their pistols just before impact.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /><ref>{{citation |first=Peter |last=Young |title=The English Civil War Armies |year=1977 |orig-year=1973 |location=Reading |publisher=Osprey |series=Men-at-arms series |oclc=505954051 |postscript=. }}</ref>{{page needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHowever, with Oliver Cromwell and the introduction of the more disciplined [[New Model Army]], a group of disciplined pikemen would stand their ground in the face of charging cavalry and could have a devastating effect. While the Parliamentarian cavalry were slower than the cavaliers, they were also better disciplined.<ref name=\"Simkin\" /> The Royalists had a tendency to chase down individual targets after the initial charge leaving their forces scattered and tired. [[Ironside (cavalry)|Cromwell's cavalry]], on the other hand, trained to operate as a single unit, which led to many decisive victories.<ref>{{citation |first=John |last=Tincey |title=Ironsides: English Cavalry 1588\u20131688 |year=2012 |page=63 |publisher=Osprey |oclc=842879605 |postscript=. }}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n===The King's rule===\n{{History of England}}\nThe English Civil War broke out less than forty years after the death of Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in 1603. Elizabeth's death had resulted in the succession of her [[Cousin chart|first cousin twice-removed]], [[James VI and I|King James VI of Scotland]], to the English throne as James I of England, creating the first [[Union of the Crowns|personal union of the Scottish and English kingdoms]].{{efn|Although the early 17th century Stuart monarchs styled themselves King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, with the exception of the constitutional arrangements during the [[Interregnum (England)|Interregnum]] (see the [[Tender of Union]]), full union of the Scottish and English realms into a new realm of Great Britain did not occur until the passing of the [[Act of Union 1707]].}} As King of Scots, James had become accustomed to Scotland's weak parliamentary tradition since assuming control of the Scottish government in 1583, so that upon assuming power south of the border, the new King of England was genuinely affronted by the constraints the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] attempted to place on him in exchange for money. In spite of this, James' personal extravagance meant he was perennially short of money and had to resort to extra-Parliamentary sources of income.\n\nThis extravagance was tempered by James' peaceful disposition, so that by the succession of his son [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] to the English and Scottish thrones in 1625 the two kingdoms had both experienced relative peace, both internally and in their relations with each other, for as long as anyone could remember. Charles hoped to unite the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland into a new single kingdom, fulfilling the dream of his father.<ref>{{Harvnb|Croft|2003|p=63}}.</ref> Many English Parliamentarians had suspicions regarding such a move because they feared that setting up a new kingdom might destroy the old English traditions which had bound the English monarchy. As Charles shared his father's position on the power of the crown (James had described kings as \"little gods on Earth\", chosen by God to rule in accordance with the doctrine of the \"[[Divine Right of Kings]]\"), the suspicions of the Parliamentarians had some justification.<ref>{{Harvnb|McClelland|1996|p=224}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:King Charles I after original by van Dyck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Charles I, painted by Van Dyck]]\n\n===Parliament in the English constitutional framework===\nAt the time, the Parliament of England did not have a large permanent role in the English system of government. Instead, Parliament functioned as a temporary advisory committee and was summoned only if and when the monarch saw fit. Once summoned, a parliament's continued existence was at the king's pleasure, since it was subject to dissolution by him at any time.\n\nYet, in spite of this limited role, over the preceding centuries Parliament had acquired ''de facto'' powers of enough significance that monarchs could not simply ignore them indefinitely. For a monarch, Parliament's most indispensable power was its ability to raise tax revenues far in excess of all other sources of revenue at the Crown's disposal. By the seventeenth century, Parliament's tax-raising powers had come to be derived from the fact that the [[gentry]] was the only stratum of society with the ability and actual authority to collect and remit the most meaningful forms of taxation then available at the local level. This meant that if the king wanted to ensure a smooth collection of revenue, he needed the co-operation of the gentry. For all of the Crown's legal authority, by any modern standard, its resources were limited to the extent that, if and when the gentry refused to collect the king's taxes on a national scale, the Crown lacked any practical means with which to compel them.\n\nTherefore, in order to secure their co-operation, monarchs permitted the gentry (and only the gentry) to elect representatives to sit in the [[House of Commons of England|House of Commons]]. When assembled along with the [[House of Lords]], these elected representatives formed a Parliament. The concept of Parliaments therefore allowed representatives of the gentry to meet, primarily (at least in the opinion of the monarch) so that they could give their sanction to whatever taxes the monarch expected their electorate to collect. In the process, the representatives could also confer and send policy proposals to the king in the form of bills. However, Parliament lacked any legal means of forcing its will upon the monarch; its only leverage with the king was the threat of its withholding the financial means required to execute his plans.{{sfn|Johnston|1901|pp=83\u201386}}\n\n===Parliamentary concerns and the Petition of Right===\n[[File:Sir Peter Lely 001.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], painted by [[Peter Lely]], 1660]]\nMany concerns were raised over Charles's marriage to a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], French princess [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], in 1625. The Parliament refused to assign him the traditional right to collect customs duties for his entire reign, deciding instead to grant it only on a provisional basis and negotiate with him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|pp=129\u201330}}.</ref>\n\nCharles, meanwhile, decided to send an expeditionary force to relieve the French [[Huguenots]] whom French royal troops held [[Siege of La Rochelle|besieged in La Rochelle]]. Military support for Protestants on the Continent had the potential to alleviate concerns brought about by the King's marriage to a Catholic. However, Charles's insistence on having his unpopular royal favourite [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham|George Villiers, the Duke of Buckingham]], assume command of the English force undermined that support. Unfortunately for Charles and Buckingham, the relief expedition proved a fiasco (1627),<ref>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=166}}.</ref> and Parliament, already hostile to Buckingham for his monopoly on [[Patronage|royal patronage]], opened [[impeachment]] proceedings against him.<ref name=Gregg-175>{{Harvnb|Gregg|1984|p=175}}.</ref> Charles responded by dissolving Parliament. This move, while saving Buckingham, reinforced the impression that Charles wanted to avoid Parliamentary scrutiny of his ministers.<ref name=Gregg-175/>\n\nHaving dissolved Parliament and unable to raise money without it, the king assembled a new one in 1628. (The elected members included [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[Edward Coke]].) The new Parliament drew up the [[Petition of Right]], and Charles accepted it as a concession in order to obtain his subsidy.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\">{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=93}}.</ref> Among other things, the Petition referred to [[Magna Carta]].<ref>[[Petition of Right]] at III, VII.</ref> However, it did not grant him the right of [[tonnage and poundage]], which Charles had been collecting without Parliamentary authorisation since 1625.{{sfn|Sommerville|1992|pp=65, 71, 80}} Several of the more active members of the opposition were imprisoned, which caused some outrage;{{sfn|Sommerville|1992|pp=65, 71, 80}} one, [[John Eliot (statesman)|John Eliot]], subsequently died in prison, becoming regarded as a martyr for the rights of Parliament.{{sfn|Russell|1998|p=417}}\n\n===Personal rule===\nCharles I avoided calling a Parliament for the next decade, a period known as the \"[[personal rule of Charles I]]\", or the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Rosner|Theibault|2000|p=103}}.</ref> During this period, Charles's lack of money determined policies. First and foremost, to avoid Parliament, the King needed to avoid war. Charles made peace with France and Spain, effectively ending England's involvement in the [[Thirty Years' War]]. However, that in itself was far from enough to balance the Crown's finances.\n\nUnable to raise revenue without Parliament and unwilling to convene it, Charles resorted to other means. One method was reviving certain conventions, often long-outdated. For example, a failure to attend and to receive [[knighthood]] at Charles's coronation was a finable offence with the fine paid to the Crown. The King also tried to raise revenue through the [[ship money]] tax, by exploiting a naval-war scare in 1635, demanding that the inland English counties pay the tax for the [[Royal Navy]]. Established law supported this policy, but authorities had ignored it for centuries, and many regarded it as yet another extra-Parliamentary (and therefore illegal) tax.<ref name=Pipes-143>{{Harvnb|Pipes|1999|p=143}}.</ref> Some prominent men refused to pay ship money, arguing that the tax was illegal, but they lost in court, and the fines imposed on them for refusing to pay ship money (and for standing against the tax's legality) aroused widespread indignation.<ref name=Pipes-143/>\n\nDuring the \"Personal Rule\", Charles aroused most antagonism through his religious measures: he believed in [[High church|High Anglicanism]], a sacramental version of the [[Church of England]], theologically based upon [[Arminianism in the Church of England|Arminianism]], a creed shared with his main political advisor, Archbishop [[William Laud]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=48}}.</ref> In 1633, Charles appointed Laud as [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and started making the Church more ceremonial, replacing the wooden [[Mass (liturgy)#Communion rite|communion]] tables with stone altars.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=96}}.</ref> Puritans accused Laud of reintroducing Catholicism; when they complained, he had them arrested. In 1637, [[John Bastwick]], [[Henry Burton (Puritan)|Henry Burton]], and [[William Prynne]] had their ears cut off for writing pamphlets attacking Laud's views\u2014a rare penalty for [[Gentleman|gentlemen]], and one that aroused anger.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=201}}.</ref> Moreover, the Church authorities revived the statutes passed in the time of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] about church attendance and fined Puritans for not attending Anglican church services.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1987|p=173}}.</ref>\n\n===Rebellion in Scotland===\n{{Main|Bishops' War}}\nThe end of Charles's independent governance came when he attempted to apply the same religious policies in Scotland. The [[Church of Scotland]], reluctantly [[Episcopal polity|episcopal]] in structure, had independent traditions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=74}}.</ref> Charles, however, wanted one uniform Church throughout Britain<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=83}}.</ref> and introduced a new, High Anglican version of the English [[Book of Common Prayer]] to Scotland in the middle of 1637. This was violently resisted; a riot broke out in Edinburgh,<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=75}}.</ref> which may have been started in [[St Giles' Cathedral]], according to legend, by [[Jenny Geddes]]. In February 1638, the Scots formulated their objections to royal policy in the [[National Covenant]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=77}}.</ref> This document took the form of a \"loyal protest\", rejecting all innovations not first having been tested by free parliaments and General Assemblies of the Church.\n\nIn the spring of 1639, King Charles I accompanied his forces to the Scottish border to end the rebellion known as the [[Bishops' War]].<ref name=Purkiss-96>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=96}}.</ref> But, after an inconclusive military campaign, he accepted the offered Scottish truce: the [[Pacification of Berwick]]. The truce proved temporary, and a second war followed in the middle of 1640. This time, a Scots army defeated Charles's forces in the north, then captured [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=97}}.</ref> Charles eventually agreed not to interfere with Scotland's religion and paid the Scots' war-expenses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\n===Recall of the English Parliament===\nCharles needed to suppress the rebellion in Scotland. He had insufficient funds, however, and needed to seek money from a newly elected [[Short Parliament|English Parliament]] in 1640.<ref name=Coward-180>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=180}}.</ref> The majority faction in the new Parliament, led by [[John Pym]], took this appeal for money as an opportunity to discuss grievances against the Crown and opposed the idea of an English invasion of Scotland. Charles took exception to this ''[[lese majesty|l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]]'' (offence against the ruler) and dissolved the Parliament after only a few weeks; hence the name \"the [[Short Parliament]]\".<ref name=Coward-180/>\n\nWithout Parliament's support, Charles attacked Scotland again, breaking the truce at Berwick, and suffered a comprehensive defeat. The Scots went on to invade England, occupying [[Northumberland]] and [[Durham, England|Durham]].<ref name=Coward-180/> Meanwhile, another of Charles' chief advisors, [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, 1st Viscount Wentworth]], had risen to the role of Lord Deputy of Ireland in 1632<ref name=Purkiss-89>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=89}}.</ref> and brought in much-needed revenue for Charles by persuading the Irish Catholic gentry to pay new taxes in return for promised religious concessions.<ref>{{Harvnb|Coward|2003|p=172}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1639, Charles had recalled Wentworth to England and in 1640 made him Earl of Strafford, attempting to have him achieve similar results in Scotland.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> This time he proved less successful and the English forces fled the field in their second encounter with the Scots in 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-89/> Almost the entirety of Northern England was occupied and Charles was forced to pay \u00a3850 per day to keep the Scots from advancing. If he did not, they would \"take\" the money by pillaging and burning the cities and towns of Northern England.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sharp|2000|p=13}}.</ref>\n\nAll this put Charles in a desperate financial position. As King of Scots, he had to find money to pay the Scottish army in England; as King of England, he had to find money to pay and equip an English army to defend England. His means of raising English revenue without an English Parliament fell critically short of achieving this.<ref name=\"Purkiss 2007 93\"/> Against this backdrop, and according to advice from the [[Magnum Concilium]] (the [[House of Lords]], but without the [[House of Commons of England|Commons]], so not a Parliament), Charles finally bowed to pressure and summoned another English Parliament in November 1640.<ref name=Purkiss-96/>\n\n===The Long Parliament===\n{{Main|Long Parliament}}\n[[File:LongParliament.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Session of the Long Parliament]]\nThe new Parliament proved even more hostile to Charles than its predecessor. It immediately began to discuss grievances against Charles and his government and with Pym and [[John Hampden|Hampden]] (of [[ship money]] fame) in the lead, took the opportunity presented by the King's troubles to force various reforming measures\u2014including many with strong \"anti-Papist\" themes\u2014upon him.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=104\u201305}}.</ref> The legislators passed a law which stated that a new Parliament should convene at least once every three years\u2014without the King's summons, if necessary. Other laws passed by the Parliament made it illegal for the king to impose taxes without Parliamentary consent and later gave Parliament control over the king's ministers. Finally, the Parliament passed a law forbidding the King to dissolve it without its consent, even if the three years were up. Ever since, this Parliament has been known as the \"Long Parliament\". However, Parliament did attempt to avert conflict by requiring all adults to sign [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], an oath of allegiance to Charles.{{efn|See {{Harvnb|Walter|1999|p=294}}, for some of the complexities of how the Protestation was interpreted by different political actors.}}\n\nEarly in the Long Parliament's proceedings the house overwhelmingly accused [[Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford|Thomas Wentworth, Earl of Strafford]] of high treason and other crimes and misdemeanours.\n\n[[Henry Vane the Younger]] supplied evidence in relation to Strafford's claimed improper use of the army in Ireland, alleging that Strafford was encouraging the King to use his army raised in Ireland to threaten England into compliance. This evidence was obtained from Vane's father, [[Henry Vane the Elder]], a member of the King's Privy council, who refused to confirm it in Parliament out of loyalty to Charles. On 10 April 1641, Pym's case collapsed, but Pym made a direct appeal to [[Henry Vane the Younger]] to produce a copy of the notes from the King's Privy council, discovered by the younger Vane and secretly turned over to Pym, to the great anguish of the Elder Vane.<ref name=Upham187>{{harvnb|Upham|1842|p=187}}</ref> These notes from the King's Privy Council contained evidence Strafford had told the King, \"Sir, you have done your duty, and your subjects have failed in theirs; and therefore you are absolved from the rules of government, and may supply yourself by extraordinary ways; you have an army in Ireland, with which you may reduce the kingdom.\"{{sfn|Upham|1842|p=187}}{{sfn|Hibbert|1968|p=154}}{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=224}}\n\nPym immediately launched a [[Bill of attainder|Bill of Attainder]], stating Strafford's guilt and demanding that the Earl be put to death.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=224}} Unlike a guilty finding in a court case, attainder did not require a [[legal burden of proof]], but it did require [[Royal Assent|the king's approval]]. Charles, however, guaranteed Strafford that he would not sign the attainder, without which the bill could not be passed.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=225}} Furthermore, the Lords were opposed to the severity of the sentence of death imposed upon Strafford. Yet, increased tensions and [[First Army Plot|a plot]] in the army to support Strafford began to sway the issue.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=225}} On 21 April, the Commons passed the Bill (204 in favour, 59 opposed, and 250 abstained),{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=123}} and the Lords acquiesced. Charles, still incensed over the Commons' handling of Buckingham, refused. Strafford himself, hoping to head off the war he saw looming, wrote to the king and asked him to reconsider.{{sfn|Abbott|''Downfall''}} Charles, fearing for the safety of his family, signed on 10 May.{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=123}} Strafford was beheaded two days later.{{sfn|Coward|1994|p=191}} In the meantime both Parliament and the King agreed to an independent investigation into the king's involvement in Strafford's plot.\n\nThe Long Parliament then passed the [[Triennial Act]], also known as the [[Dissolution Act]] in May 1641, to which the Royal Assent was readily granted.{{sfn|Carlton|1995|p=222}}{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=127}} The Triennial Act required that Parliament be summoned at least once every three years, and that when the King failed to issue proper summons, the members could assemble on their own. This act also forbade ship money without Parliament's consent, fines in destraint of knighthood and forced loans. Monopolies were cut back severely, and the Courts of [[Star Chamber]] and [[Court of High Commission|High Commission]] were abolished by the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1640]] and the Triennial Act respectively.{{sfn|Gregg|1981|p= 335}} All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the Tonnage and Poundage Act.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=129}} On 3 May, Parliament decreed [[Protestation of 1641|The Protestation]], attacking the 'wicked counsels' of Charles's government, whereby those who signed the petition undertook to defend 'the true reformed religion', parliament, and the king's person, honour and estate. Throughout May, the House of Commons launched several bills attacking bishops and episcopalianism in general, each time defeated in the Lords.{{sfn|Kenyon|1978|p=130}}{{sfn|Abbott|''Downfall''}}\n\nIt was hoped by both Charles and Parliament that the execution of Strafford and the Protestation would end the drift towards war; in fact, they encouraged it. Charles and his supporters continued to resent Parliament's demands, while Parliamentarians continued to suspect Charles of wanting to impose episcopalianism and unfettered royal rule by military force. Within months, the Irish Catholics, fearing a resurgence of Protestant power, [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|struck first]], and all Ireland soon descended into chaos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|pp=109\u2013113}}.</ref> Rumours circulated that the King supported the Irish, and Puritan members of the Commons soon started murmuring that this exemplified the fate that Charles had in store for them all.<ref>See {{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=113}} for the concerns of a similar English Catholic rising.</ref>\n\nIn early January 1642, accompanied by 400 soldiers, Charles attempted to arrest five members of the House of Commons on a charge of treason.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41>{{Harvnb|Sherwood|1997|p=41}}.</ref> This attempt failed. When the troops marched into Parliament, Charles enquired of [[William Lenthall]], the [[List of Speakers of the House of Commons of England|Speaker]], as to the whereabouts of the five. Lenthall replied, \"May it please your Majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as the House is pleased to direct me, whose servant I am here.\"<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/> In other words, the Speaker proclaimed himself a servant of Parliament, rather than of the King.<ref name=Sherwood-1997-41/>\n\n===Local grievances===\nIn the summer of 1642 these national troubles helped to polarise opinion, ending indecision about which side to support or what action to take. Opposition to Charles also arose owing to many local grievances. For example, the imposition of drainage schemes in [[The Fens]] negatively affected the livelihood of thousands of people after the King awarded a number of drainage contracts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hughes|1991|p=127}}.</ref> Many regarded the King as indifferent to public welfare, and this played a role in bringing a large part of eastern England into the Parliamentarian camp. This sentiment brought with it people such as the [[Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester|Earl of Manchester]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]], each a notable wartime adversary of the King. Conversely, one of the leading drainage contractors, the [[Robert Bertie, 1st Earl of Lindsey|Earl of Lindsey]], was to die fighting for the King at the [[Battle of Edgehill]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Purkiss|2007|p=180}}.</ref>\n\n==First English Civil War (1642\u20131646)==\n{{Main|First English Civil War}}\n[[File:English civil war map 1642 to 1645.JPG|thumb|Maps of territory held by Royalists (red) and Parliamentarians (yellow-green), 1642\u20131645]]\n\nIn early January 1642, a few days after his failure to capture five members of the House of Commons, fearing for the safety of his family and retinue, Charles left the London area for the north of the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=57}}.</ref> Further negotiations by frequent correspondence between the King and the [[Long Parliament]] through to early summer proved fruitless. As the summer progressed, cities and towns declared their sympathies for one faction or the other: for example, the garrison of Portsmouth under the command of Sir [[George Goring, Lord Goring|George Goring]] declared for the King,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=107}}.</ref> but when Charles tried to acquire arms for his cause from [[Kingston upon Hull]], the depository for the weapons used in the previous Scottish campaigns, Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the military governor appointed by Parliament in January, refused to let Charles enter Hull,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=82}}.</ref> and when Charles returned with more men later, [[Siege of Hull (1642)|Hotham drove them off]].<ref name=\"Wedgwood 1970 100\">{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=100}}.</ref> Charles issued a warrant for Hotham to be arrested as a traitor but was powerless to enforce it. Throughout the summer months, tensions rose and there was brawling in a number of places, with the first death from the conflict taking place in Manchester.<ref name=\"Wedgwood 1970 100\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=158\u201366}}.</ref>\n\nAt the outset of the conflict, much of the country remained neutral, though the [[Royal Navy]] and most English cities favoured Parliament, while the King found considerable support in rural communities. Historians estimate that between them, both sides had only about 15,000 men.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, the war quickly spread and eventually involved every level of society. Many areas attempted to remain neutral. Some formed bands of [[Clubmen]] to protect their localities against the worst excesses of the armies of both sides,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=403\u201304}}.</ref> but most found it impossible to withstand both the King and Parliament. On one side, the King and his supporters fought for traditional government in Church and state. On the other, most supporters of the Parliamentary cause initially took up arms to defend what they thought of as the traditional balance of government in Church and state, which the bad advice the King had received from his advisers had undermined before and during the \"Eleven Years' Tyranny\". The views of the members of parliament ranged from unquestioning support of the King\u2014at one point during the First Civil War, more members of the Commons and Lords gathered in the King's [[Oxford Parliament (1644)|Oxford Parliament]] than at [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]\u2014through to radicals, who wanted major reforms in favour of [[Nonconformism|religious independence]] and the redistribution of power at the national level. However, even the most radical supporters of the Parliamentarian cause still favoured the retention of Charles on the throne.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For all information since the last citation}}\n\nAfter the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|debacle at Hull]], Charles moved on to [[Nottingham]], where on 22 August 1642, he raised the [[Royal Standard of England|royal standard]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=111}}.</ref> When he raised his standard, Charles had with him about 2,000 cavalry and a small number of Yorkshire infantry-men, and using the archaic system of a [[Commission of Array]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=96}}.</ref> Charles's supporters started to build a larger army around the standard. Charles moved in a south-westerly direction, first to [[Stafford]], and then on to [[Shrewsbury]], because the support for his cause seemed particularly strong in the [[River Severn|Severn]] valley area and in [[North Wales]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=170, 183}}.</ref> While passing through [[Wellington, Shropshire|Wellington]], in what became known as the \"[[Wellington Declaration]]\", he declared that he would uphold the \"Protestant religion, the laws of England, and the liberty of Parliament\".<ref>{{harvnb|Sherwood|1992|p=6}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Oliver Cromwell by Samuel Cooper.jpg|thumb|left|[[Oliver Cromwell]]]]\n\nThe Parliamentarians who opposed the King had not remained passive during this pre-war period. As in the case of Kingston upon Hull, they had taken measures to secure strategic towns and cities by appointing to office men sympathetic to their cause, and on 9 June they had voted to raise an army of 10,000 volunteers and appointed [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] commander three days later.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=108\u201309}}.</ref> He received orders \"to rescue His Majesty's person, and the persons of the [[Charles II of England|Prince [of Wales]]] and the [[James II of England|Duke of York]] out of the hands of those desperate persons who were about them\".<ref>{{Harvnb|Hibbert|1993|p=65}}.</ref> The [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenant]], whom Parliament appointed, used the [[Militia Ordinance]] to order the militia to join Essex's army.<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=161, 165}}.</ref>\n\nTwo weeks after the King had raised his standard at Nottingham, Essex led his army north towards [[Northampton]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=113}}.</ref> picking up support along the way (including a detachment of [[Cambridgeshire]] cavalry raised and commanded by [[Oliver Cromwell]]).{{efn|Cromwell had already secured Cambridge and the supplies of college silver {{Harv|Wedgwood|1970|p=106}}.}} By the middle of September Essex's forces had grown to 21,000 infantry and 4,200 cavalry and [[dragoon]]s. On 14 September he moved his army to [[Coventry]] and then to the north of the [[Cotswolds]],<ref>Wegwood, p.115.</ref> a strategy which placed his army between the Royalists and London. With the size of both armies now in the tens of thousands, and only Worcestershire between them, it was inevitable that cavalry reconnaissance units would sooner or later meet. This happened in the first major skirmish of the Civil War, when a cavalry troop of about 1,000 Royalists commanded by [[Prince Rupert]], a German nephew of the King and one of the outstanding cavalry commanders of the war,<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=148}}.</ref> defeated a Parliamentary cavalry detachment under the command of Colonel John Brown in the [[Battle of Powick Bridge]], at a bridge across the [[River Teme]] close to [[Worcester]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|pp=171\u201388}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rupert of the Rhine.jpg|thumb|[[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]]]]\n\nRupert withdrew to Shrewsbury, where a council-of-war discussed two courses of action: whether to advance towards Essex's new position near [[Worcester]], or to march along the now opened road towards London. The Council decided to take the London route, but not to avoid a battle, for the Royalist generals wanted to fight Essex before he grew too strong, and the temper of both sides made it impossible to postpone the decision. In the [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Earl of Clarendon's]] words: \"it was considered more counsellable to march towards London, it being morally sure that the earl of Essex would put himself in their way\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=404}} Accordingly, the army left Shrewsbury on 12 October, gaining two days' start on the enemy, and moved south-east. This had the desired effect, as it forced Essex to move to intercept them.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=404}}\n\nThe first [[pitched battle]] of the war, fought at [[Battle of Edgehill|Edgehill]] on 23 October 1642, proved inconclusive, and both the Royalists and Parliamentarians claimed it as a victory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=130\u201301}}.</ref> The second field action of the war, the stand-off at [[Turnham Green (Battle)|Turnham Green]], saw Charles forced to withdraw to [[Oxford]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=135}}.</ref> This city would serve as his base for the remainder of the war.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|pp=167\u201368, 506\u201307}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1643, the Royalist forces won at [[Battle of Adwalton Moor|Adwalton Moor]], and gained control of most of [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Wedgwood|1970|p=209}}.</ref> In the Midlands, a Parliamentary force under [[Sir John Gell, 1st Baronet|Sir John Gell]] besieged and captured the cathedral city of [[Lichfield]], after the death of the original commander, Lord Brooke.<ref name=Wanklyn-74>{{Harvnb|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=74}}.</ref> This group subsequently joined forces with Sir John Brereton to fight the inconclusive [[Battle of Hopton Heath]] (19 March 1643), where the Royalist commander, the [[Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], was killed.<ref name=Wanklyn-74/> Subsequent battles in the west of England at [[Battle of Lansdowne|Lansdowne]] and at [[Battle of Roundway Down|Roundway Down]] also went to the Royalists.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wanklyn|Jones|2005|p=103}}.</ref> Prince Rupert could then take [[Bristol]].

[[John Calvin]] formulated a doctrine of [[Presbyterianism]], which held that in the New Testament the offices of ''presbyter'' and ''episkopos'' were identical; he rejected the doctrine of [[apostolic succession]]. Calvin's follower [[John Knox]] brought Presbyterianism to [[Scotland]] when the Scottish church was reformed in 1560. In practice, Presbyterianism meant that committees of lay elders had a substantial voice in church government, as opposed to merely being subjects to a ruling [[hierarchy]].\n\nThis vision of at least partial [[democracy]] in [[ecclesiology]] paralleled the struggles between [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and [[List of English monarchs|the King]]. A body within the [[Puritan]] movement in the [[Church of England]] sought to abolish the office of bishop and remake the Church of England along Presbyterian lines. The [[Martin Marprelate]] tracts (1588\u20131589), applying the [[pejorative]] name of ''[[prelate|prelacy]]'' to the church hierarchy, attacked the office of bishop with satire that deeply offended [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] and her [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[John Whitgift]]. The [[vestments controversy]] also related to this movement, seeking further reductions in church ceremony, and labelling the use of elaborate vestments as \"unedifying\" and even [[idolatry and Christianity|idolatrous]].\n\n[[James I of England|King James I]], reacting against the perceived contumacy of his Presbyterian Scottish subjects, adopted \"No Bishop, no King\" as a slogan; he tied the hierarchical authority of the bishop to the absolute authority he sought as king, and viewed attacks on the authority of the bishops as attacks on his own authority. Matters came to a head when King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] appointed [[William Laud]] as the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; Laud aggressively attacked the Presbyterian movement and sought to impose the full [[Book of Common Prayer|Anglican liturgy]]. The controversy eventually led to Laud's [[impeachment]] for [[treason]] by a [[bill of attainder]] in 1645, and subsequent execution. Charles also attempted to impose episcopacy on Scotland; the Scots' violent rejection of bishops and liturgical worship sparked the [[Bishops' Wars]] in 1639\u20131640.\n\nDuring the height of Puritan power in [[Commonwealth of England|the Commonwealth]] and [[the Protectorate]], episcopacy was formally abolished in the Church of England on 9 October 1646.{{sfn|King|1968|p=523\u201337}} The Church of England remained Presbyterian until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy with [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1660.<ref>{{harvnb|Plant|2002|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}</ref>\n\n==English overseas possessions==\n{{details|English overseas possessions in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms}}\nDuring the period of the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions were highly involved. In the [[Channel Islands in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Channel Islands]], the island of Jersey and [[Castle Cornet]] in Guernsey supported the King until in December 1651 they surrendered with honour. Although the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, most notably [[Massachusetts]], were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies sided with the Crown. Friction between royalists and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the [[Battle of the Severn]]. The [[Virginia Company of London|Virginia Company's]] settlements, [[Bermuda]] and [[Virginia]], as well as [[Antigua]] and [[Barbados]] were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda's Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the [[Bahamas]] under [[William Sayle]] as the [[Eleutheran Adventurers]]. Parliament passed [[An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego]] in October, 1650, which stated that\n{{quote|due punishment [be] inflicted upon the said Delinquents, do Declare all and every the said persons in Barbada's, Antego, Bermuda's and Virginia, that have contrived, abetted, aided or assisted those horrid Rebellions, or have since willingly joyned with them, to be notorious Robbers and Traitors, and such as by the Law of Nations are not to be permitted any maner of Commerce or Traffique with any people whatsoever; and do forbid to all maner of persons, Foreiners, and others, all maner of Commerce, Traffique and Correspondency whatsoever, to be used or held with the said Rebels in the Barbada's, Bermuda's, Virginia and Antego, or either of them.}}\n\nThe Act also authorised Parliamentary [[privateer]]s to act against English vessels trading with the rebellious colonies:\n{{quote|All Ships that Trade with the Rebels may be surprized. Goods and tackle of such ships not to be embezeled, till judgement in the Admiralty.; Two or three of the Officers of every ship to be examined upon oath.}}\n\nThe Parliament began assembling a fleet to invade the Royalist colonies, but many of the English islands in the Caribbean were captured by the Dutch and French in 1651 during the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]]. Far to the North, Bermuda's regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. The colony made a separate peace that respected its internal status quo. The [[Parliament of Bermuda]] avoided the Parliament of England's fate during [[The Protectorate]], becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.\n\nVirginia's population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan [[Richard Bennett (Governor)|Richard Bennett]] was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal \"Commonwealth Governors\". The loyalty of Virginia's [[Virginia Cavaliers (historical)|Cavaliers]] to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 [[English Restoration|Restoration of the Monarchy]] when King Charles II dubbed it the ''Old Dominion''.\n\n==Casualties==\n\nFigures for casualties during this period are unreliable, but some attempt has been made to provide rough estimates.<ref>{{harvnb|White|2012|loc=}}. {{better source|date=July 2012}}</ref><ref name=Carlton-211-214>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA211,M1 pp. 211\u201314]}}.</ref>\nIn England, a conservative estimate is that roughly 100,000 people died from war-related disease during the three civil wars.

Casualties include the deaths of prisoners-of-war in conditions that accelerated their deaths, with estimates of 10,000 prisoners not surviving or not returning home (8,000 captured during and immediately after the [[Battle of Worcester]] were deported to [[New England]], [[Bermuda]] and the [[West Indies]] to work for landowners as [[indentured labour]]ers<ref>{{Harvnb|Royle|2006|p=602}}.</ref>). There are no figures to calculate how many died from war-related diseases, but if the same ratio of disease to battle deaths from English figures is applied to the Scottish figures, a not unreasonable estimate of 60,000 people is achieved,<ref name=Carlton-212>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA212,M1 p. 212]}}.</ref> from a population of about one million.<ref name=James-187/>\n\nFigures for Ireland are described as \"miracles of conjecture\". Certainly the devastation inflicted on Ireland was massive, with the best estimate provided by Sir [[William Petty]], the father of English demography. Petty estimates that 112,000 Protestants and 504,000 Catholics were killed through [[Black Death|plague]], war and [[famine]], giving an estimated total of 616,000 dead,<ref name=Carlton-213>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA213,M1 p. 213]}}.</ref> from a pre-war population of about one and a half million.<ref name=James-187/> Although Petty's figures are the best available, they are still acknowledged as being tentative; they do not include the estimate of 40,000 driven into exile, some of whom served as soldiers in European continental armies, while others were sold as indentured servants to New England and the West Indies. Many of those sold to landowners in New England eventually prospered, but many of those sold to landowners in the West Indies were worked to death.\n\nThese estimates indicate that England suffered a 3.7% loss of population, Scotland a loss of 6%, while Ireland suffered a loss of 41% of its population. Putting these numbers into the context of other catastrophes helps to understand the devastation to Ireland in particular. The [[Great Hunger]] of 1845\u20131852 resulted in a loss of 16% of the population, while during the Second World War the population of the Soviet Union fell by 16%.<ref name=Carlton-214>{{Harvnb|Carlton|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=tVugNXnVrVAC&pg=PP10&lpg=PP9#PPA214,M1 p. 214]}}.</ref>\n\n==Popular gains==\nOrdinary people took advantage of the dislocation of civil society during the 1640s to derive advantages for themselves.

In the wake of victory, many of the ideals (and many of the idealists) became sidelined.

It was no coincidence that the United Kingdom was spared the wave of revolutions that occurred in Europe in the 1840s. Specifically, future monarchs became wary of pushing Parliament too hard, and Parliament effectively chose the line of royal succession in 1688 with the [[Glorious Revolution]] and in the 1701 [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]]. After the [[English Restoration|Restoration]], Parliament's factions became political parties (later becoming the [[Tory|Tories]] and [[Whig (UK)|Whigs]]) with competing views and varying abilities to influence the decisions of their monarchs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n==Historiography and explanations==\n{{Puritan history}}\nIn the early decades of the 20th century the [[Whig history|Whig school]] was the dominant theoretical view. They explained the Civil War as resulting from a centuries-long struggle between Parliament (especially the House of Commons) and the Monarchy, with Parliament defending the traditional rights of Englishmen, while the Stuart monarchy continually attempted to expand its right to arbitrarily dictate law. The most important Whig historian, [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner|S.R. Gardiner]],{{full citation needed|date=April 2017}} popularised the idea that the English Civil War was a \"Puritan Revolution\": challenging the repressive Stuart Church, and preparing the way for [[religious toleration]] in the Restoration. Thus, Puritanism was the natural ally of a people preserving their traditional rights against arbitrary monarchical power.\n\nThe Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the [[Marxism|Marxist]] school, which became popular in the 1940s, and which interpreted the English Civil War as a [[bourgeois]] revolution.

For example, the wars began when King Charles I tried imposing an Anglican Prayer Book upon Scotland, and when this was met with resistance from the [[Covenanter]]s, he needed an army to impose his will. However, this forced him to call an English Parliament to raise new taxes to pay for the army. The English Parliaments were not willing to grant Charles the revenue he needed to pay for the Scottish expeditionary army unless he addressed their grievances. By the early 1640s, Charles was left in a state of near permanent crisis management; often he was not willing to concede enough ground to any one faction to neutralise the threat, and in some circumstances to do so would only antagonise another faction. For example, Charles finally agreed upon terms with the Covenanters in August 1641, but although this might have weakened the position of the English Parliament, the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out in October 1641, largely negating the political advantage he had obtained by relieving himself of the cost of the Scottish invasion.{{sfn|Ohlmeyer|2002}}\n\n[[Thomas Hobbes]] gives a much earlier historical account of the English Civil War in his essay [[Behemoth (Hobbes book)|Behemoth]], written in 1668 and published in 1681. He reports that the causes of the war were the doctrines of politics and conflicts that arose from science that disputed those political doctrines.{{sfn|Hobbes|1839|p=220}}\n\nBehemoth offered a uniquely historical and philosophical approach to naming the catalysts for the war. It also served as a political statement to explain why King Charles I was incapable of holding his place of power and maintaining peace in his kingdom.{{sfn|Kraynak|1990|p=33}}\n\nSpecifically, Hobbes analyses the following aspects of English thought during the war (listed in order of his discussions in Behemoth): the opinions of divinity and politics that spurred rebellion; rhetoric and doctrine used by the rebels against the king; and how opinions about \"taxation, the conscription of soldiers, and military strategy\" affected the outcomes of battles and shifts of sovereignty.{{sfn|Kraynak|1990|p=33}}\n\nHobbes offered a unique contribution to historical interpretation of the civil war through his Behemoth by connecting the civil war to the motivations of intellectuals who Hobbes reports caused it by trying to spread certain ideas throughout the nation, largely for the sake of displaying their own wisdom and learning.{{sfn|Goldsmith|1966|pp=x\u2013xiii}}\n\nHobbes held the belief that clerical pretensions had contributed significantly to the trouble during the civil war\u2014\"whether those of puritan fundamentalists, papal supremacists or divine right Episcopalians\".{{sfn|Sommerville|2012}} Hobbes wanted to revoke all of independent power of the clergy and to change the civil system such that they were controlled by the state.\n\nSome scholars suggest that Behemoth has not received its due respect as an academic work, being comparatively overlooked and underrated in the shadow of [[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]].{{sfn|Kraynak|1990|p= }}{{page needed|date=September 2016}}{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}} One factor that may have contributed to its lack of reception as a historical work is that it takes the form of a dialogue. While philosophical dialogues are common, historical ones are not. Other factors that hindered its success include King Charles II's refusing its publication and Hobbes' chiefly interpretive approach to the historical narrative.{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}}\n\nMuch can be gleaned about Hobbes as a person from looking at the difficulties he faced while seeking an audience for Behemoth. The essay illuminates a flaw shared by most of Hobbes's political philosophy as well, which is his lack of ability or willingness to empathize with perspectives that largely differed from his own. As his perspective was so much at odds with other views, Hobbes struggled to understand the thinking of most of his potential audience and people in general.{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}} For instance, he accredits the Presbyterians and Parliamentarians with \"improbably long-planned and wicked ambitions\".{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}} What's more, \"he hardly understands the orthodox Royalists (he was himself a highly unorthodox Royalist) any better, and he makes only limited concessions of sincerity to the religious feelings of the various parties\".{{sfn|Macgillivray|1970|p=179}}\n\n==Re-enactments==\n[[File:Civil war reeanactment.JPG|thumb|right|A historical civil war re-enactment]]\nTwo large historical societies exist, [[The Sealed Knot (reenactment)|The Sealed Knot]] and [[The English Civil War Society]], which regularly [[English Civil War reenactment|re-enact]] events and battles of the Civil War in full period costume.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of the English Civil War]], showing events leading up to, culminating in, and resulting from the English Civil Wars.\n* [[First English Civil War, 1642]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1643]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1644]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1645]]\n* [[First English Civil War, 1646]]\n* [[Cromwell's Soldiers' Pocket Bible]], booklet Cromwell issued to his army in 1643.\n* [[English Dissenters]]\n* [[William Hiseland]], the last Royalist veteran of the Civil War\n* [[Thirty Years' War]], a defining event in European history during the reign of Charles I.\n* The [[Levellers]], a movement for political reform.\n* [[Diggers]]\n<!-- * [[Tyne-Wear rivalry#Origins of the rivalry]] --Needs a source that the Tyne-Wear rivalry is partially based on the Civil War and not just on FTM -->\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|3}}\n* {{Citation |ref={{sfnRef|Abbott|''Downfall''}} |last=Abbott |first=Jacob |url=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=_contents |title=Charles I |chapter=Chapter: Downfall of Strafford and Laud |chapterurl=http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=abbott&book=charles1&story=downfall}}\n* {{Citation |last=Atkin |first=Malcolm |title=Worcester 1651 |publisher=Pen and Sword |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84415-080-9|location = Barnsley|pages = }}\n* {{Citation |last=Aylmer |first=G.

Unlike [[abstract algebra]], elementary algebra is not concerned with [[algebraic structures]] outside the realm of [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s.\n\nThe use of variables to denote quantities allows general relationships between quantities to be formally and concisely expressed, and thus enables solving a broader scope of problems. Many quantitative relationships in science and mathematics are expressed as algebraic [[equation]]s.\n\n==Algebraic notation ==\n{{main|Mathematical notation}}\nAlgebraic notation describes the rules and conventions for writing [[Expression (mathematics)|mathematical expressions]], as well as the terminology used for talking about parts of expressions. For example, the expression <math style=\"margin-bottom:8px\">3x^2 - 2xy + c</math> has the following components:\n<center>\n[[File:algebraic equation notation.svg|256px]]<br>\n1 : [[Exponent]] (power), 2 : [[Coefficient]], 3 : [[addend|term]], 4 : [[Operation (mathematics)|operator]], 5 : [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]], <math>x, y</math> : [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]s\n</center>\n\nA ''coefficient'' is a numerical value, or letter representing a numerical constant, that multiplies a variable (the operator is omitted). A ''term'' is an [[Addend#Notation and terminology|addend or a summand]], a group of coefficients, variables, constants and exponents that may be separated from the other terms by the plus and minus operators.<ref>Richard N.

By convention, letters at the beginning of the alphabet (e.g. <math>a, b, c</math>) are typically used to represent [[Mathematical constant|constant]]s, and those toward the end of the alphabet (e.g. <math>x, y</math> and <math>z</math>) are used to represent [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]s.<ref>William L.

Some equations are true for all values of the involved variables (such as <math>a + b = b + a</math>); such equations are called [[identity (mathematics)|identities]]. Conditional equations are true for only some values of the involved variables, e.g. <math>x^2 - 1 = 8</math> is true only for <math>x = 3</math> and <math>x = -3</math>. The values of the variables which make the equation true are the solutions of the equation and can be found through [[equation solving]].\n\nAnother type of equation is an inequality. Inequalities are used to show that one side of the equation is greater, or less, than the other. The symbols used for this are: <math> a > b </math> where <math> > </math> represents 'greater than', and <math> a < b </math> where <math> < </math> represents 'less than'. Just like standard equality equations, numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided. The only exception is that when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, the inequality symbol must be flipped.\n\n==== Properties of equality ====\n\nBy definition, equality is an [[equivalence relation]], meaning it has the properties (a) [[reflexive relation|reflexive]] (i.e. <math>b = b</math>), (b) [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] (i.e. if <math>a = b</math> then <math>b = a</math>) (c) [[transitive relation|transitive]] (i.e. if <math>a = b</math> and <math>b = c</math> then <math>a = c</math>).<ref>Douglas Downing, ''Algebra the Easy Way'', Publisher Barron's Educational Series, 2003, {{ISBN|0764119729}}, 9780764119729, 392 pages, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RiX-TJLiQv0C&lpg=PA20&ots=BjArsBq8vc&dq=algebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&pg=PA20#v=onepage&q=algebra%20equality%20%20%20reflexive%20%20symmetric%20%20transitive&f=false page 20]</ref> It also satisfies the important property that if two symbols are used for equal things, then one symbol can be substituted for the other in any true statement about the first and the statement will remain true.

Substituting 3 for a in the expression a*5 makes a new expression 3*5 with meaning 15. Substituting the terms of a statement makes a new statement. When the original statement is true independent of the values of the terms, the statement created by substitutions is also true. Hence definitions can be made in symbolic terms and interpreted through substitution: if <math>a^2:=a*a</math>, where := means \"is defined to equal\", substituting 3 for <math>a</math> informs the reader of this statement that <math>3^2</math> means 3*3=9. Often it's not known whether the statement is true independent of the values of the terms, and substitution allows one to derive restrictions on the possible values, or show what conditions the statement holds under. For example, taking the statement x+1=0, if x is substituted with 1, this imples 1+1=2=0, which is false, which implies that if x+1=0 then x can't be 1.\n\nIf ''x'' and ''y'' are [[integers]], [[rationals]], or [[real numbers]], then ''xy''=0 implies ''x''=0 or ''y''=0. Suppose ''abc''=0. Then, substituting ''a'' for ''x'' and ''bc'' for ''y'', we learn ''a''=0 or ''bc''=0. Then we can substitute again, letting ''x''=''b'' and ''y''=''c'', to show that if ''bc''=0 then ''b''=0 or ''c''=0. Therefore, if ''abc''=0, then ''a''=0 or (''b''=0 or ''c''=0), so ''abc''=0 implies ''a''=0 or ''b''=0 or ''c''=0.\n\nConsider if the original fact were stated as \"''ab''=0 implies ''a''=0 or ''b''=0.\" Then when we say \"suppose ''abc''=0,\" we have a conflict of terms when we substitute. Yet the above logic is still valid to show that if ''abc''=0 then ''a''=0 or ''b''=0 or ''c''=0 if instead of letting ''a''=''a'' and ''b''=''bc'' we substitute ''a'' for ''a'' and ''b'' for ''bc'' (and with ''bc''=0, substituting ''b'' for ''a'' and ''c'' for ''b''). This shows that substituting for the terms in a statement isn't always the same as letting the terms from the statement equal the substituted terms. In this situation it's clear that if we substitute an expression ''a'' into the ''a'' term of the original equation, the ''a'' substituted does not refer to the ''a'' in the statement \"''ab''=0 implies ''a''=0 or ''b''=0.\"\n\n== Solving algebraic equations ==\n{{see also|Equation solving}}\n[[File:Algebraproblem.jpg|thumb|A typical algebra problem.]]\n\nThe following sections lay out examples of some of the types of algebraic equations that may be encountered.\n\n=== Linear equations with one variable ===\n{{Main|Linear equation}}\n\nLinear equations are so-called, because when they are plotted, they describe a straight line. The simplest equations to solve are [[linear equation]]s that have only one variable. They contain only constant numbers and a single variable without an exponent. As an example, consider:\n\n:Problem in words: If you double the age of a child and add 4, the resulting answer is 12. How old is the child?\n\n:Equivalent equation: <math>2x + 4 = 12</math> where  <math>x</math> represent the child's age\n\nTo solve this kind of equation, the technique is add, subtract, multiply, or divide both sides of the equation by the same number in order to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.  Once the variable is isolated, the other side of the equation is the value of the variable.<ref>{{Cite book|title=All the Math You'll Ever Need|author=Slavin, Steve|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|year=1989|isbn=0-471-50636-2|page=72}}</ref> This problem and its solution are as follows:\n{|\n|-\n| 1.

Using the second equation:\n\n: <math>2x - y = 1 </math>\n\nSubtracting <math>2x</math> from each side of the equation:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}2x - 2x - y & = 1 - 2x  \\\\\n- y & = 1 - 2x\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand multiplying by \u22121:\n\n: <math> y = 2x - 1. </math>\n\nUsing this <math>y</math> value in the first equation in the original system:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}4x + 2(2x - 1) &= 14\\\\\n4x + 4x - 2 &= 14 \\\\\n8x - 2 &= 14 \\end{align}</math>\n\nAdding ''2'' on each side of the equation:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}8x - 2 + 2 &= 14 + 2 \\\\\n8x &= 16 \\end{align}</math>\n\nwhich simplifies to\n\n: <math>x = 2 </math>\n\nUsing this value in one of the equations, the same solution as in the previous method is obtained.\n\n: <math>\\begin{cases} x = 2 \\\\ y = 3. \\end{cases}</math>\n\nNote that this is not the only way to solve this specific system; in this case as well, <math>y</math> could have been solved before <math>x</math>.\n\n=== Other types of systems of linear equations ===\n\n==== Inconsistent systems ====\n[[File:Parallel Lines.svg|thumb|right|The equations <math>3x + 2y = 6</math> and <math>3x + 2y = 12</math> are parallel and cannot intersect, and is unsolvable.]]\n[[File:Quadratic-linear-equations.svg|thumb|right|Plot of a quadratic equation (red) and a linear equation (blue) that do not intersect, and consequently for which there is no common solution.]]\n\nIn the above example, a solution exists. However, there are also systems of equations which do not have any solution. Such a system is called [[inconsistent system|inconsistent]]. An obvious example is\n\n: <math>\\begin{cases}\\begin{align} x + y &= 1 \\\\\n0x + 0y &= 2\\,. \\end{align} \\end{cases}</math>\n\nAs 0\u22602, the second equation in the system has no solution. Therefore, the system has no solution.\nHowever, not all inconsistent systems are recognized at first sight. As an example, let us consider the system \n: <math>\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}4x + 2y &= 12 \\\\\n-2x - y &= -4\\,. \\end{align}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nMultiplying by 2 both sides of the second equation, and adding it to the first one results in\n: <math>0x+0y = 4 \\,,</math>\nwhich has clearly no solution.\n\n==== Undetermined systems ====\n\nThere are also systems which have infinitely many solutions, in contrast to a system with a unique solution (meaning, a unique pair of values for <math>x</math> and <math>y</math>) For example:\n\n: <math>\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}4x + 2y & = 12 \\\\\n-2x - y & = -6 \\end{align}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nIsolating <math>y</math> in the second equation:\n\n: <math>y = -2x + 6 </math>\n\nAnd using this value in the first equation in the system:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}4x + 2(-2x + 6) = 12 \\\\\n4x - 4x + 12 = 12 \\\\\n12 = 12 \\end{align}</math>\n\nThe equality is true, but it does not provide a value for <math>x</math>. Indeed, one can easily verify (by just filling in some values of <math>x</math>) that for any <math>x</math> there is a solution as long as <math>y = -2x + 6</math>. There is an infinite number of solutions for this system.\n\n==== Over- and underdetermined systems ====\n\nSystems with more variables than the number of linear equations are called [[underdetermined system|underdetermined]]. Such a system, if it has any solutions, does not have a unique one but rather an infinitude of them. An example of such a system is\n\n: <math>\\begin{cases}\\begin{align}x + 2y & = 10\\\\\ny - z  & = 2 .\\end{align}\\end{cases}</math>\n\nWhen trying to solve it, one is led to express some variables as functions of the other ones if any solutions exist, but cannot express ''all'' solutions [[Number|numerically]] because there are an infinite number of them if there are any.\n\nA system with a greater number of equations than variables is called [[overdetermined system|overdetermined]]. If an overdetermined system has any solutions, necessarily some equations are [[linear combination]]s of the others.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[History of elementary algebra]]\n* [[Binary operation]]\n* [[Gaussian elimination]]\n* [[Mathematics education]]\n* [[Number line]]\n* [[Polynomial]]\n* [[Cancelling out]]\n\n== References ==\n*[[Leonhard Euler]],  '' [[Elements of Algebra]]'', 1770.

August 14, 1863 \u2013 August 21, 1940) was an [[American literature|American writer]] and poet who wrote the poem \"Casey\" (or \"[[Casey at the Bat]]\"), which is \"the single most famous baseball poem ever written\" according to the [[Baseball Almanac]],<ref name=Almanac>{{cite web|title=Casey at the Bat by Ernest Thayer|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_case.shtml|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=October 17, 2012}}</ref> and \"the nation\u2019s best-known piece of [[comic verse]]\u2014a [[ballad]] that began a native [[legend]] as colorful and permanent as that of [[Johnny Appleseed]] or [[Paul Bunyan]].\"<ref name=Gardner>{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Casey at the Bat|journal=American Heritage|date=October 1967|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/casey-bat|accessdate=October 20, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nThayer was born in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], and raised in nearby [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]]. He graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in [[philosophy]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1885, where he had been editor of the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'' and a member of the theatrical society [[Hasty Pudding Theatricals|Hasty Pudding]]. [[William Randolph Hearst]], a friend from both activities, hired Thayer as humor [[columnist]] for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'' 1886\u201388.<ref name=Gardner />\n{{Quote_box\n|width=20%\n|align=left\n|quote=\"During my brief connection with the Examiner, I put out large quantities of nonsense, both [[prose]] and [[Poetry|verse]], sounding the whole newspaper [[gamut]] from advertisements to editorials. In general quality 'Casey' (at least in my judgment) is neither better nor worse than much of the other stuff. Its persistent vogue is simply unaccountable, and it would be hard to say, all things considered, if it has given me more pleasure than annoyance. The constant wrangling about the [[authorship]], from which I have tried to keep aloof, has certainly filled me with disgust.\"<ref name=Gardner />|source=Ernest Thayer}}\nThayer's last piece, dated June 3, 1888, was a ballad entitled \"Casey\" (\"Casey at the Bat\") which made him \"a prize specimen of the [[One-hit wonder|one-poem poet]]\" according to [[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']].<ref name=Gardner />\n\nIt was not until several months after the publication of the poem that Thayer became famous for it, since he was hardly the boastful type and had signed the June 24 poem with the nickname \"Phin\" which he had used since his time as a writer for the ''Harvard Lampoon''.<ref name=Almanac /> Two mysteries remain about the poem: whether Casey and Mudville were based on a real person or place, and, if so, their actual identities. On March 31, 2007, Katie Zezima of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote an article called \"In 'Casey' Rhubarb, 2 Cities Cry 'Foul!'\" on the competing claims of two towns to such renown: [[Stockton, California]], and [[Holliston, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E5DC1739F932A05750C0A9629C8B63&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|first=Katie|last=Zezima|title=In 'Casey' Rhubarb, 2 Cities Cry 'Foul!'|date=March 31, 2004|accessdate=June 3, 2008|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\nOn the possible model for Casey, Thayer dismissed the notion that any single living baseball player was an influence. However, late 1880s Boston star [[King Kelly|Mike \"King\" Kelly]] is likely as a model for Casey's baseball situations. Besides being a native of a town close to Boston, Thayer, as a ''San Francisco Examiner'' baseball reporter in the off-season of 1887\u201388, covered exhibition games featuring Kelly. During November 1887, some of his reportage about a Kelly at-bat has the same ring as Casey's famous at-bat in the poem. A 2004 book by Howard W. Rosenberg, ''Cap Anson 2: The Theatrical and Kingly Mike Kelly: U.S. Team Sport's First Media Sensation and Baseball's Original Casey at the Bat,'' reprints a 1905 Thayer letter to a Baltimore scribe who was asking about the poem's roots. In the letter, Thayer named Kelly (d. 1894), as having shown \"impudence\" in claiming to have written it. Rosenberg argues that if Thayer still felt offended, Thayer may have later denied Kelly as an influence. Kelly had also performed as a vaudeville actor, and recited the poem dozens of times.\n[[File:Casey at the Bat pg 19.jpg|thumb|Illustration of \"Casey at Bat\"]]\nThe first public performance of the poem was on August 14, 1888, by actor [[De Wolf Hopper]], on Thayer's 25th birthday. Thayer's recitation of the poem at a Harvard class reunion in 1895 helps solve the mystery, which lingered into the 20th century, of who had written it.\n\nDuring the mid-1890s, Thayer contributed several other comic poems for Hearst's newspaper ''[[New York Journal]]'' and then began overseeing his family's mills in Worcester full-time. Thayer relocated to [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] in 1912, where he married Rosalind Buel Hammett and retired. He died in 1940, at age 77.\n\n''The New York Times''' obituary of Thayer on August 22, 1940, p.&nbsp;19 quotes comedian [[DeWolf Hopper]], who helped make the poem famous: \n:\"Thayer indubitably wrote 'Casey,' but he could not recite it.... I have heard many others give 'Casey.' Fond mamas have brought their sons to me to hear their childish voices lisp the poem, but Thayer's was the worst of all. In a sweet, dulcet Harvard whisper he implored 'Casey' to murder the umpire, and gave this cry of mass animal rage all the emphasis of a caterpillar wearing rubbers crawling on a velvet carpet. He was rotten.\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{wikisource author}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Biography}}\n*{{librivox author|id=2442}}\n*{{Find a Grave|24168611|name=Ernest Lawrence Thayer}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Thayer, Ernest}}\n[[Category:1863 births]]\n[[Category:1940 deaths]]\n[[Category:American male poets]]\n[[Category:Harvard Lampoon alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard University alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Lawrence, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Writers from Worcester, Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:Writers from Santa Barbara, California]]\n[[Category:The San Francisco Examiner people]]\n[[Category:American male non-fiction writers]]", "sha1": "ks48lv1z3gj6tlw2q1ryfn4bgumlibh"}}, {"title": "List of English-language poets", "ns": "0", "id": "9714", "revision": {"id": "866476941", "parentid": "866476824", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T15:41:51Z", "contributor": {"username": "JackintheBox", "id": "30011325"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted 1 edit by [[Special:Contributions/2405:204:D309:C544:6481:9BFC:34BA:5DCD|2405:204:D309:C544:6481:9BFC:34BA:5DCD]] ([[User talk:2405:204:D309:C544:6481:9BFC:34BA:5DCD|talk]]) to last revision by Bmcln1.

Sometimes Excalibur and the [[#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]] (the proof of Arthur's lineage) are said to be the same weapon, but in most versions they are considered separate.

In the [[Lancelot-Grail|Vulgate ''Mort Artu'']], Arthur is at the brink of death and so orders [[Griflet]] to throw the sword into the enchanted lake; after two failed attempts (as he felt such a great sword should not be thrown away), Griflet finally complies with the wounded king's request and a hand emerges from the lake to catch it.

In ''Culhwch and Olwen'', it is one of Arthur's most valuable possessions and is used by Arthur's warrior [[Llenlleawg]] the Irishman to kill the Irish king Diwrnach while stealing his magical cauldron. Irish mythology mentions a weapon ''Caladbolg'', the sword of [[Fergus mac R\u00f3ich]], which was also known for its incredible power and was carried by some of Ireland's greatest heroes. The name, which can also mean \"hard cleft\" in [[Irish language|Irish]], appears in the plural, ''caladbuilc'', as a generic term for \"great swords\" in ''Togail Troi'' (\"The Destruction of [[Troy]]\"), the 10th-century Irish translation of the classical tale.<ref>Thurneysen, R. \"Zur Keltischen Literatur und Grammatik\", ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr celtische Philologie'', Volume 12, p. 281ff.</ref><ref>O'Rahilly, T.  F. ''Early Irish history and mythology'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1957, p. 68.</ref>\n\nThough not named as Caledfwlch, Arthur's sword is described vividly in ''[[The Dream of Rhonabwy]]'', one of the tales associated with the ''Mabinogion'': {{-}}\n\n{{quote|Then they heard [[Cador|Cadwr Earl of Cornwall]] being summoned, and saw him rise with Arthur's sword in his hand, with a design of two [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]] on the golden hilt; when the sword was unsheathed what was seen from the mouths of the two chimeras was like two flames of fire, so dreadful that it was not easy for anyone to look. At that the host settled and the commotion subsided, and the earl returned to his tent.|From ''The Mabinogion'', translated by Jeffrey Gantz.<ref>Gantz, ''The Mabinogion'', p. 184.</ref>}}\n\nIn the late 15th/early 16th-century [[Middle Cornish]] play ''[[Beunans Ke]]'', Arthur's sword is called ''Calesvol'', which is etymologically an exact Middle Cornish cognate of the Welsh ''Caledfwlch''. It is unclear if the name was borrowed from the Welsh (if so, it must have been an early loan, for phonological reasons), or represents an early, pan-Brittonic traditional name for Arthur's sword.<ref>Koch, John. ''Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 329.</ref>\n\nGeoffrey's ''Historia'' is the first non-Welsh source to speak of the sword. Geoffrey says the sword was forged in [[Avalon]] and Latinises the name \"Caledfwlch\" as ''Caliburnus''. When his influential pseudo-history made it to [[Continental Europe]], writers altered the name further until it finally took on the popular form ''Excalibur'' (various spellings in the medieval Arthurian romance and chronicle tradition include: Calabrun, Calabrum, Calibourne, Callibourc, Calliborc, Calibourch, Escaliborc, and Escalibor<ref>Zimmer, Heinrich. \"Bretonische Elemente in der Arthursage des Gottfried von Monmouth\", ''Zeitschrift f\u00fcr franz\u00f6sische Sprache und Literatur'', Volume 12, E. Franck's, 1890, p. 236.</ref>). The legend was expanded upon in the Vulgate Cycle, also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle, and in the Post-Vulgate Cycle which emerged in its wake. Both included the work known as the ''Prose Merlin'', but the Post-Vulgate authors left out the ''Merlin'' continuation from the earlier cycle, choosing to add an original account of Arthur's early days including a new origin for Excalibur.\n\nIn several early French works, such as [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]'' and the Vulgate ''Lancelot Proper'' section, Excalibur is used by Gawain, Arthur's nephew and one of his best knights. This is in contrast to later versions, where Excalibur belongs solely to the king.\n\n==Attributes==\nIn many versions, Excalibur's blade was engraved with phrases on opposite sides: \"Take me up\" and \"Cast me away\" (or similar). In addition, when Excalibur was first drawn, in the first battle testing Arthur's sovereignty, its blade blinded his enemies. Malory<ref>Book I, 19, from ''The Works of Sir Thomas Malory,'' Ed.

Loss of blood from injuries, for example, would not kill the bearer. In some tellings, wounds received by one wearing the scabbard did not bleed at all. In the later romance tradition, including ''Le Morte d'Arthur'', the scabbard is stolen from Arthur by his half-sister [[Morgan le Fay]] in revenge for the death of her beloved [[Accolon]] and thrown into a lake, never to be found again. This act later enables the death of Arthur at the [[Battle of Camlann]].\n\n==Arthur's other weapons==\nExcalibur is by no means the only weapon associated with Arthur, nor the only sword.

The chord in the box is played for the full bar. If two chords are in the box they are each played for half a bar, etc. The chords are represented as [[scale degree]]s in [[Roman numeral analysis]]. Roman numerals are used so the musician may understand the progression of the chords regardless of the key it is played in.\n\n: {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; width:250px;\"\n|+Eight-bar blues<ref>Alfred Publishing (2002).
