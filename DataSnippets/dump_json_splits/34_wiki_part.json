By the [[American Revolution]], most residents lived near the [[Cambridge Common|Common]] and Harvard College, with most of the town comprising farms and estates. Most inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists, but there was also a small elite of [[Anglicans|Anglican]] \"worthies\" who were not involved in village life, made their livings from estates, investments, and trade, and lived in mansions along \"the Road to Watertown\" (today's [[Brattle Street (Cambridge, Massachusetts)|Brattle Street]], still known as [[Tory Row]]). Coming up from [[Virginia Colony|Virginia]], [[George Washington]] took command of the volunteer American soldiers camped on [[Cambridge Common]] on July 3, 1775,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} now reckoned the birthplace of the [[U.S. Army]].{{efn|The name of today's nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that event.}} Most of the [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Tory]] estates were confiscated after the Revolution. On January 24, 1776, [[Henry Knox]] arrived with artillery captured from [[Fort Ticonderoga]], which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Boston.\n\n[[File:Cambridge 1873 WardMap.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of Cambridge from 1873]]\nBetween 1790 and 1840, Cambridge grew rapidly, with the construction of the [[West Boston Bridge]] in 1792 connecting Cambridge directly to Boston, so that it was no longer necessary to travel {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} through the [[Boston Neck]], [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]], and [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]] to cross the [[Charles River]]. A second bridge, the Canal Bridge, opened in 1809 alongside the new [[Middlesex Canal]]. The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and [[marsh]]land into prime industrial and residential districts.\n\nIn the mid-19th century, Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution. It was home to some of the famous Fireside Poets\u2014so called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fires. The [[Fireside Poets]]\u2014[[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[James Russell Lowell]], and [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]]\u2014were highly popular and influential in their day.\n\nSoon after, [[Toll road|turnpikes]] were built: the [[Cambridge and Concord Turnpike]] (today's Broadway and Concord Ave.), the [[Middlesex Turnpike (Massachusetts)|Middlesex Turnpike]] (Hampshire St. and [[Massachusetts Avenue (Boston)|Massachusetts Ave.]] northwest of [[Porter Square]]), and what are today's Cambridge, Main, and Harvard Streets connected various areas of Cambridge to the bridges. In addition, the town was connected to the [[Boston & Maine Railroad]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911|p=96}} leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] from the formerly rural parts of [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]].\n\n[[File:1852 Middlesex Canal (Massachusetts) map.jpg|thumb|1852 Map of Boston area showing Cambridge and regional rail lines and highlighting the course of the [[Middlesex Canal]].

Between 1850 and 1900, Cambridge took on much of its present character\u2014[[streetcar suburb]]an development along the turnpikes, with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge, comfortable middle-class housing on the old Cambridgeport and Mid-Cambridge estates, and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills. The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge led to three major changes: the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave., Concord Ave. and [[Alewife Brook]]; the ice-cutting industry launched by [[Frederic Tudor]] on [[Fresh Pond, Cambridge, Massachusetts|Fresh Pond]]; and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to house the thousands of immigrants who arrived to work in the new industries.\n\nFor many decades, the city's largest employer was the [[New England Glass Company]], founded in 1818. By the middle of the 19th century it was the world's largest and most modern glassworks. In 1888, [[Edward Libbey|Edward Drummond Libbey]] moved all production to [[Toledo, Ohio]], where it continues today under the name [[Owens-Illinois]]. The company's flint glassware with heavy lead content is prized by antique glass collectors. There is none on public display in Cambridge, but the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] has a large collection. The [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]] and the Sandwich Glass Museum on [[Cape Cod]] also have a few pieces.\n\nBy 1920, Cambridge was one of [[New England]]'s main industrial cities, with nearly 120,000 residents. Among the largest businesses in Cambridge during the period of industrialization was [[Carter's Ink Company]], whose neon sign long adorned the [[Charles River]] and which was for many years the world's largest ink manufacturer. Next door was the [[Atheneum Press]].

It also began to become an intellectual, rather than an industrial, center. Harvard University had always been important as both a landowner and an institution, but it began to play a more dominant role in the city's life and culture. When [[Radcliffe College]] was established in 1879 the town became a mecca for some of the nation's most academically talented female students. The [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s move from Boston in 1916 reinforced Cambridge's status as an intellectual center of the United States.\n\nAfter the 1950s, the city's population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couples. The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups, creating software such as [[Visicalc]] and [[Lotus 1-2-3]], and advanced computers, but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the [[minicomputer]] and [[DOS]]-based systems. The city continues to be home to many startups. Kendall Square was a major software hub through the [[dot-com boom]] and today hosts offices of such major technology companies as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and the headquarters of [[Akamai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.akamai.com/us/en/locations.jsp|title=Locations - Akamai|website=Akamai.com|accessdate=May 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Harvard's plans to start experiments with recombinant DNA led to a three-month moratorium and a citizen review panel. In the end, Cambridge decided to allow such experiments but passed safety regulations in 1977. This led to regulatory certainty and acceptance when [[Biogen]] opened a lab in 1982, in contrast to the hostility that caused the Genetic Institute (a Harvard spinoff) to abandon Somerville and Boston for Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2016/03/17/how-cambridge-became-the-life-sciences-capital/|title=How Cambridge became the life sciences capital|publisher=}}</ref> The biotech and pharmaceutical industries have since thrived in Cambridge, which now includes headquarters for Biogen and [[Genzyme]]; laboratories for [[Novartis]], [[Teva Pharmaceutical Industries|Teva]], [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], [[Alnylam Pharmaceuticals|Alnylam]], [[Ironwood Pharmaceuticals|Ironwood]], [[Catabasis Pharmaceuticals|Catabasis]], [[Moderna Therapeutics]], [[Editas Medicine]]; support companies such as [[Cytel]]; and many smaller companies.\n\nBy the end of the 20th century, Cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the Northeastern United States.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Glaeser|first=E.

Each square acts as a neighborhood center. These include:\n* [[Kendall Square]], formed by the junction of Broadway, Main Street, and Third Street. It is also known as '''Technology Square''', a name shared with an office and laboratory building cluster in the neighborhood. Just over the [[Longfellow Bridge]] from Boston, at the eastern end of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] campus, it is served by the [[Kendall (MBTA station)|Kendall/MIT]] station on the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA]] [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] subway. Most of Cambridge's large office towers are here, giving the area something of the feel of an office park. A flourishing [[biotech]] industry has grown up in this area. The [[Cambridge Innovation Center]], a large co-working space, is in Kendall Square at 1 Broadway. The Cambridge Center office complex is in Kendall Square, and not at the actual center of Cambridge. The \"One Kendall Square\" complex is nearby, but confusingly not actually in Kendall Square.\n* [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]], formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Prospect Street, and Western Avenue. Well known for its wide variety of ethnic restaurants, it was rather rundown as recently as the late 1990s; it underwent a controversial [[gentrification]] in recent years (in conjunction with the development of the nearby [[University Park at MIT]]), and continues to grow more expensive. It is served by the [[Central (MBTA station)|Central Station]] stop on the MBTA Red Line subway. '''Lafayette Square''', formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Columbia Street, Sidney Street, and Main Street, is considered part of the Central Square area. [[Cambridgeport]] is south of Central Square along Magazine Street and Brookline Street.\n* [[Harvard Square]], formed by the junction of Massachusetts Avenue, Brattle Street, and JFK Street. This is the primary site of [[Harvard University]] and a major Cambridge shopping area. It is served by a [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Red Line station]]. Harvard Square was originally the Red Line's northwestern terminus and a major transfer point to streetcars that also operated in a short [[Harvard Bus Tunnel|tunnel]]\u2014which is still a major bus terminal, although the area under the Square was reconfigured dramatically in the 1980s when the Red Line was extended. The Harvard Square area includes '''Brattle Square''' and '''Eliot Square'''. A short distance away from the square lies the [[Cambridge Common]], while the neighborhood north of Harvard and east of Massachusetts Avenue is known as Agassiz, after the famed scientist [[Louis Agassiz]].\n* [[Porter Square]], about a mile north on Massachusetts Avenue from Harvard Square, at the junction of Massachusetts and Somerville Avenues. It includes part of the city of [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] and is served by the [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter Square Station]], a complex housing a [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] stop and a [[Fitchburg Line]] [[MBTA commuter rail|commuter rail]] stop. [[Lesley University]]'s University Hall and Porter campus are in Porter Square.\n* [[Inman Square]], at the junction of Cambridge and Hampshire streets in Mid-Cambridge. It is home to many diverse restaurants, bars, music venues and boutiques. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] streetlights, benches and bus stops were recently added to the streets, and a new city park was installed.\n* [[Lechmere Square]], at the junction of Cambridge and First streets, adjacent to the CambridgeSide Galleria shopping mall.

The [[Massachusetts Turnpike]] does not pass through Cambridge, but provides access by an exit in nearby [[Allston, Massachusetts|Allston]]. Both [[U.S. Route 1]] and [[I-93 (MA)|Interstate 93]] also provide additional access on the eastern end of Cambridge at Leverett Circle in [[Boston]]. [[Massachusetts State Highway 2A|Route 2A]] runs the length of the city, chiefly along [[Massachusetts Avenue (metropolitan Boston)|Massachusetts Avenue]].

Contrary to popular belief, the road system did not evolve from longstanding cow-paths. Roads connected various village settlements with each other and nearby towns, and were shaped by geographic features, most notably streams, hills, and swampy areas. Today, the major \"squares\" are typically connected by long, mostly straight roads, such as Massachusetts Avenue between [[Harvard Square]] and [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]], or Hampshire Street between [[Kendall Square]] and [[Inman Square]].\n\n====Mass transit====\n[[File:Central MBTA station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Central (MBTA)|Central Station]] on the [[MBTA Red Line]]]]\nCambridge is well served by the [[MBTA]], including the [[Porter (MBTA station)|Porter Square Station]] on the regional [[MBTA Commuter Rail|Commuter Rail]]; the [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere Station]] on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]]; and the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at [[Alewife Station (MBTA)|Alewife]], [[Porter (MBTA)|Porter Square]], [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard Square]], [[Central (MBTA station)|Central Square]], and [[Kendall/MIT (MBTA station)|Kendall Square/MIT]] Stations.

The tunnel was partially reconfigured when the Red Line was extended to Alewife in the early 1980s.\n\nBesides the state-owned transit agency, the city is also served by the Charles River Transportation Management Agency (CRTMA) shuttles which are supported by some of the largest companies operating in city, in addition to the municipal government itself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |title=Charles River TMA Members |author=Staff writer |date=January 1, 2013 |work=CRTMA |publisher= |trans-title= |accessdate=January 1, 2013 |quote= |ref= |separator= |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127055722/http://charlesrivertma.org/members.htm |archivedate=November 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====Cycling====\nCambridge has several [[bike path]]s, including one along the Charles River,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041117145514/http://www.mass.gov/dcr/parks/metroboston/maps/bikepaths_dudley.gif |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 17, 2004 |title=Dr. Paul Dudley White Bikepath |accessdate=April 28, 2012}}</ref> and the [[Cambridge Linear Park|Linear Park]] connecting the [[Minuteman Bikeway]] at Alewife with the [[Somerville Community Path]].

Retrieved on 20 July 2010.</ref>\n\n===Secondary education===\n[[File:Scotch from chapel.JPG|thumb|right|[[Scotch College, Melbourne]] is an independent secondary school]]\nIn some national education systems, [[secondary school]]s may be called \"colleges\" or have \"college\" as part of their title.\n\nIn Australia the term \"college\" is applied to any private or independent (non-government) primary and, especially, secondary school as distinct from a [[state school]]. [[Melbourne Grammar School]], [[Cranbrook School, Sydney]] and [[The King's School, Parramatta]] are considered colleges.\n\nThere has also been a recent trend to rename or create government [[secondary schools]] as \"colleges\". In the state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], some state high schools are referred to as ''secondary colleges'', although the pre-eminent government secondary school for boys in [[Melbourne]] is still named [[Melbourne High School]]. In Western Australia, South Australia and the [[Northern Territory]], \"college\" is used in the name of all state high schools built since the late 1990s, and also some older ones. In [[New South Wales]], some high schools, especially multi-campus schools resulting from mergers, are known as \"secondary colleges\". In [[Queensland]] some newer schools which accept primary and high school students are styled ''state college'', but state schools offering only secondary education are called \"State High School\". In [[Tasmania]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]], \"college\" refers to the final two years of high school (years 11 and 12), and the institutions which provide this. In this context, \"college\" is a system independent of the other years of high school. Here, the expression is a shorter version of ''matriculation college''.\n\nIn a number of Canadian cities, many government-run secondary schools are called \"collegiates\" or \"[[collegiate institutes]]\" (C.I.), a complicated form of the word \"college\" which avoids the usual \"post-secondary\" connotation. This is because these secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational, subjects and ability levels (for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses). Some private secondary schools (such as [[Upper Canada College]], [[Vancouver College]]) choose to use the word \"college\" in their names nevertheless.<ref>[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp Private Elementary and Secondary Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109045046/http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/general/elemsec/privsch/search.asp |date=9 January 2009 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014enter \"college\" in the \"name contains\" field and check the \"secondary\" checkbox</ref> Some secondary schools elsewhere in the country, particularly ones within the [[separate school]] system, may also use the word \"college\" or \"collegiate\" in their names.<ref>[http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp Find a School or School Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908182055/http://sbinfo.edu.gov.on.ca/schadv.asp |date=8 September 2009 }} search form on the Ministry of Education of Ontario web site\u2014click \"Secondary\" and \"Separate\"</ref>\n\nIn New Zealand the word \"college\" normally refers to a secondary school for ages 13 to 17 and \"college\" appears as part of the name especially of private or integrated schools. \"Colleges\" most frequently appear in the North Island, whereas \"high schools\" are more common in the South Island.\n\n[[File:St Johns College Johannesburg.jpg|thumb|[[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College, Johannesburg]]]]\n\nIn South Africa, some secondary schools, especially private schools on the English public school model, have \"college\" in their title. Thus no less than six of South Africa's Elite Seven high schools call themselves \"college\" and fit this description. A typical example of this category would be [[St John's College (Johannesburg, South Africa)|St John's College]].\n\nPrivate schools that specialize in improving children's marks through intensive focus on examination needs are informally called \"cram-colleges\".\n\nIn [[Sri Lanka]] the word \"college\" (known as ''Vidyalaya'' in ''[[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]'') normally refers to a secondary school, which usually signifies above the 5th standard. During the British colonial period a limited number of exclusive secondary schools were established based on English public school model ([[Royal College Colombo]], [[S. Thomas' College|S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia]], [[Trinity College, Kandy]]) these along with several Catholic schools ([[St. Joseph's College, Colombo]], [[St. Anthony's College, Kandy|St Anthony's College]]) traditionally carry their name as colleges. Following the start of free education in 1931 large group of [[Madhya Maha Vidyalayas|central colleges]] were established to educate the rural masses. Since Sri Lanka gained Independence in 1948, many schools that have been established have been named as \"college\".{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Royal College Colombo main building.jpg|thumb|right|[[Royal College Colombo]]]]\n\nAs well as an educational institution, the term can also refer, following its etymology, to any formal group of colleagues set up under statute or regulation; often under a Royal Charter. Examples are an [[electoral college]], the [[College of Arms]], a [[College (canon law)|college of canons]], and the [[College of Cardinals]]. Other collegiate bodies include professional associations, particularly in medicine and allied professions. In the UK these include the [[Royal College of Nursing]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]]. Examples in the United States include the [[American College of Physicians]], the [[American College of Surgeons]], and the American College of Dentists. An example in Australia is the [[Royal Australian College of General Practitioners]].\n\n==College by country==\n{{See also|Category:Higher education by country}}\n\n===Australia===\nIn Australia a college may be an institution of tertiary education that is smaller than a university, run independently or as part of a university. Following a reform in the 1980s many of the formerly independent colleges now belong to a larger universities.\n\nReferring to parts of a university, there are ''residential colleges'' which provide residence for students, both undergraduate and postgraduate, called [[University college#Australia|university colleges]]. These colleges often provide additional tutorial assistance, and some host [[theology|theological]] study. Many colleges have strong traditions and rituals, so are a combination of dormitory style accommodation and fraternity or sorority culture.\n\nMost technical and further education institutions ([[TAFE]]s), which offer certificate and diploma vocational courses, are styled \"TAFE colleges\" or \"Colleges of TAFE\".\n\nSome senior high schools are also referred to as colleges.\n\n===Canada===\n{{tone|section|date=February 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2018}}\n{{Main|College (Canada)}}\nIn Canada, the term \"college\" usually refers to a trades school, applied arts/science/technology/business/health school or [[Community college#Canada|community college]]. These are [[Tertiary education|post-secondary]] institutions granting [[Academic certificate|certificates]], diplomas, [[associate's degree]], and in some cases [[bachelor's degree]]s. In [[Quebec]], the term is seldom used; the French acronym for public colleges, [[CEGEP]] (''Coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel'', \"college of general and professional education\"), is colloquially all [[College education in Quebec|collegiate level]] institutions specific to the [[Education in Quebec|Quebec education system]], a step that is required to continue onto university (unless one applies as a \"mature\" student, meaning 21 years of age or over, and out of the educational system for at least 2 years), or to learn a trade. In [[Ontario]] and [[Alberta]], there are also institutions which are designated [[university college]]s, as they only grant undergraduate degrees. This is to differentiate between universities, which have both undergraduate and graduate programs and those that do not. In contrast to usage in the United States, there is a strong distinction between \"college\" and \"university\" in Canada. In conversation, one specifically would say either \"They are going to university\" (i.e., studying for a three- or four-year degree at a university) or \"They are going to college\" (suggesting technical/career training or university transfer courses).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe [[Royal Military College of Canada]], a full-fledged degree-granting university, does not follow the naming convention used by the rest of the country, nor does its sister school [[Royal Military College Saint-Jean]] or the now closed [[Royal Roads Military College]].\n\nThe term \"college\" also applies to distinct entities within a university (usually referred to as \"[[federated school|federated colleges]]\" or \"affiliated colleges\"), similar to the residential colleges in the United Kingdom. These colleges act independently, but in affiliation or federation with the university that actually grants the degrees. For example, [[University of Trinity College|Trinity College]] was once an independent institution, but later became federated with the [[University of Toronto]], and is now one of its residential colleges (though it remains a degree-granting institution through its Faculty of Divinity). The University of British Columbia has two residential graduate colleges [[Green College, University of British Columbia|Green College]] and [[St. John's College, University of British Columbia|St. John's College]] which post-date the university but provide specific programming, communities and housing. In the case of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], located in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], the [[Corner Brook]] campus is called [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]]. Occasionally, \"college\" refers to a subject specific faculty within a university that, while distinct, are neither ''federated'' nor ''affiliated''\u2014College of Education, College of Medicine, College of Dentistry, College of Biological Science<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ |title=College of Biological Science |publisher=University of Guelph |accessdate=19 June 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626040312/http://www.uoguelph.ca/cbs/ |archivedate=26 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> among others.\n\nThere are also universities referred to as art colleges, empowered to grant academic degrees of BFA, Bdes, MFA, Mdes and sometimes collaborative PhD degrees. Some of them have \"university\" in their name ([[NSCAD University]], [[OCAD University]] and [[Emily Carr University of Art and Design]])and others do not. In some Canadian provinces, the word \"college\" may also be seen in the proper name of a [[High school (North America)|high school]], especially one with a history as a [[private school]], but these institutions would not actually be considered colleges in the more general sense of the term.\n\nOnline and distance education ([[E-learning]]) use \"college\" in the name in the British sense, for example : Canada Capstone College.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vancouver.cdncompanies.com/other/canada-capstone-college-vancouver/|title=Canada Capstone College \u2013 Opening hours \u2013 360 Robson Street, Vancouver, British Columbia \u2013 Customer Reviews {{!}} Canada Online|website=vancouver.cdncompanies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}</ref>\n\nOne use of the term \"college\" in the American sense is by the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL), which calls its annual [[Draft (sports)|entry draft]] the Canadian College Draft. The draft is restricted to players who qualify under CFL rules as \"non-imports\"\u2014essentially, players who were raised in Canada (see [[Canadian Football League#Players and compensation|the main CFL article]] for a more detailed definition). Because a player's designation as \"non-import\" is not affected by where he plays post-secondary football, the category includes former players at [[College football|U.S. college football]] programs (\"universities\" in the Canadian sense) as well as [[CIS football]] programs at Canadian universities.\n\n===Chile===\nIn Chile, the term \"college\" is usually used in the name of some bilingual schools, like [[Santiago College]], [[Saint George's College, Santiago|Saint George's College]] etc.\n\n===Georgia===\nInternational Association of \"Tourists and Travelers\" College.

Portuguese?-->\n\nIn India, the term \"college\" is commonly reserved for institutions that offer degrees at year 12 (\"''Junior College''\", similar to American ''high schools''), and those that offer the [[bachelor's degree]]; some colleges, however, offer programmes up to [[PhD]] level. Generally, colleges are located in different parts of a state and all of them are affiliated to a regional university. The colleges offer programmes leading to degrees of that university. Colleges may be either Autonomous or non-autonomous.  Autonomous Colleges are empowered to establish their own syllabus, and conduct and assess their own examinations; in non-autonomous colleges, examinations are conducted by the university, at the same time for all colleges under its affiliation. There are several hundred universities and each university has affiliated colleges, often a large number.\n\nThe first liberal arts and sciences college in India was [[C. M. S. College Kottayam]], Kerala, established in 1817, and the [[Presidency College, Kolkata]], also 1817, initially known as Hindu College. The first college for the study of Christian theology and ecumenical enquiry was [[Serampore College]] (1818). The first Missionary institution to impart Western style education in India was the [[Scottish Church College, Calcutta]] (1830). The first commerce and economics college in India was [[Sydenham College]], [[Mumbai]] (1913).\n\n===Ireland===\n[[File:Trinity college front square cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Parliament Square, [[Trinity College, Dublin]]]]\n{{See also|Third-level education in the Republic of Ireland}}\n\nIn [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] the term \"college\" is normally used to describe an institution of tertiary education. University students often say they attend \"college\" rather than \"university\". Until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly; they were formally offered by a constituent college of the university.\n\nThere are number of secondary education institutions that traditionally used the word \"college\" in their names: these are either older, private schools (such as [[Belvedere College]], [[Gonzaga College]], [[Castleknock College]], and [[St Michael's College, Dublin|St. Michael's College]]) or what were formerly a particular kind of secondary school. These secondary schools, formerly known as \"technical colleges,\" were renamed \"community colleges,\" but remain secondary schools.\n\nThe country's only [[ancient university]] is the [[University of Dublin]]. Created during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], it is modelled on the collegiate universities of Cambridge and Oxford. However, only one constituent college was ever founded, hence the curious position of [[Trinity College Dublin]] today; although both are usually considered one and the same, the University and College are completely distinct corporate entities with separate and parallel governing structures.\n\nAmong more modern foundations, the [[National University of Ireland]], founded in 1908, consisted of constituent colleges and recognised colleges until 1997. The former are now referred to as constituent universities \u2013 institutions that are essentially universities in their own right. The National University can trace its existence back to 1850 and the creation of the [[Queen's University of Ireland]] and the creation of the [[Catholic University of Ireland]] in 1854. From 1880, the degree awarding roles of these two universities was taken over by the [[Royal University of Ireland]], which remained until the creation of the National University in 1908 and [[Queen's University Belfast]].\n\nThe state's two new universities, [[Dublin City University]] and [[University of Limerick]], were initially [[National Institute for Higher Education]] institutions. These institutions offered university level academic degrees and research from the start of their existence and were awarded university status in 1989 in recognition of this.\n\nThird level technical education in the state has been carried out in the [[Institutes of technology in Ireland|Institutes of Technology]], which were established from the 1970s as Regional Technical Colleges. These institutions have ''delegated authority'' which entitles them to give degrees and diplomas from [[Quality and Qualifications Ireland]] (QQI) in their own names.\n\nA number of private colleges exist such as [[Dublin Business School]], providing undergraduate and postgraduate courses validated by QQI and in some cases by other Universities.\n\nOther types of college include Colleges of Education, such as the [[Church of Ireland College of Education]]. These are specialist institutions, often linked to a university, which provide both undergraduate and postgraduate academic degrees for people who want to train as teachers.\n\nA number of state funded further education colleges exist - which offer vocational education and training in a range of areas from business studies and [[information and communications technology]] to sports injury therapy. These courses are usually one, two or less often  three years in duration and are validated by QQI at Levels 5 or 6, or for the BTEC [[Higher National Diploma]] award, which is a Level 6/7 qualification, validated by [[Edexcel]]. There are numerous private colleges (particularly in Dublin and Limerick){{citation needed|reason=need support limiting density to these two cities|date=November 2012}} which offer both further and higher education qualifications. These degrees and diplomas are often certified by foreign universities/international awarding bodies and are aligned to the National Framework of Qualifications at Levels 6, 7 and 8.\n\n===Israel===\n{{Main|List_of_universities_and_colleges_in_Israel#Colleges}}\nIn Israel, any non university higher-learning facility is called a college. Institutions accredited by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] (CHE) to confer a bachelor's degree are called \"Academic Colleges.\"<ref>Hebrew: \u05de\u05b4\u05db\u05b0\u05dc\u05b8\u05dc\u05b8\u05d4 Mikhlala; pl. \u05de\u05db\u05dc\u05dc\u05d5\u05ea Mikhlalot</ref> These colleges (at least 4 for 2012) may also offer master's degrees and act as Research facilities.

Such schools are usually run by the Roman Catholic church or missionaries in Macau. Examples include [[Chan Sui Ki Perpetual Help College]], [[Yuet Wah College]], and Sacred Heart Canossian College.\n\n===New Zealand===\n[[File:universityofotagoclocktower small.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Otago]]]]\n\nThe constituent colleges of the former [[University of New Zealand]] (such as Canterbury University College) have become independent universities. Some halls of residence associated with New Zealand universities retain the name of \"college\", particularly at the [[University of Otago]] (which although brought under the umbrella of the University of New Zealand, already possessed university status and degree awarding powers). The institutions formerly known as \"Teacher-training colleges\" now style themselves \"College of education\".\n\nSome universities, such as the [[University of Canterbury]], have divided their University into constituent administrative \"Colleges\" \u2013 the College of Arts containing departments that teach Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Science containing Science departments, and so on. This is largely modelled on the Cambridge model, discussed above.\n\nLike the United Kingdom some professional bodies in New Zealand style themselves as \"colleges\", for example, the [[Royal Australasian College of Surgeons]], the [[Royal Australasian College of Physicians]].\n\nSecondary school is often referred to as college and the term is used interchangeably with high school. This is reflected in the names of many secondary schools such as [[Rangitoto College]], New Zealand's largest secondary.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main|Higher education in the Philippines}}\nIn the Philippines, colleges usually refer to institutions of learning that grant degrees but whose scholastic fields are not as diverse as that of a university ([[University of Santo Tomas]], [[University of the Philippines]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]], [[De La Salle University]], [[Far Eastern University]], and [[AMA University]]), such as the [[San Beda College]] which specializes in law, [[AMA Computer College]] whose campuses are spread all over the Philippines which specializes in information and computing technologies, and the [[Map\u00faa Institute of Technology]] which specializes in engineering, or to component units within universities that do not grant degrees but rather facilitate the instruction of a particular field, such as a College of Science and College of Engineering, among many other colleges of the [[University of the Philippines]].\n\nA state college may not have the word \"college\" on its name, but may have several component colleges, or departments. Thus, the Eulogio Amang Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology is a state college by classification.\n\nUsually, the term \"college\" is also thought of as a hierarchical demarcation between the term \"university\", and quite a number of colleges seek to be recognized as universities as a sign of improvement in academic standards ([[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]], [[San Beda College]]), and increase in the diversity of the offered degree programs (called \"courses\"). For private colleges, this may be done through a survey and evaluation by the Commission on Higher Education and accrediting organizations, as was the case of Urios College which is now the [[Fr. Saturnino Urios University]]. For state colleges, it is usually done by a legislation by the Congress or Senate. In common usage, \"going to college\" simply means attending school for an undergraduate degree, whether it's from an institution recognized as a college or a university.\n\nWhen it comes to referring to the level of education, ''college'' is the term more used to be synonymous to tertiary or higher education. A student who is or has studied his/her undergraduate degree at either an institution with ''college'' or ''university'' in its name is considered to be going to or have gone to ''college''.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main|Education in Portugal}}\nPresently in [[Portugal]], the term ''col\u00e9gio'' (college) is normally used as a generic reference to a private (non-government) school that provides from [[basic education|basic]] to [[secondary education]]. Many of the private schools include the term ''col\u00e9gio'' in their name. Some special public schools - usually of the boarding school type - also include the term in their name, with a notable example being the ''[[Col\u00e9gio Militar]]'' (Military College). The term ''col\u00e9gio interno'' (literally \"internal college\") is used specifically as a generic reference to a [[boarding school]].\n\nUntil the 19th century, a ''col\u00e9gio'' was usually a secondary or pre-university school, of public or religious nature, where the students usually lived together. A model for these colleges was the Royal College of Arts and Humanities, founded in [[Coimbra]] by King [[John III of Portugal]] in 1542.\n\n===Singapore===\nThe term \"college\" in [[Singapore]] is generally only used for pre-university educational institutions called \"Junior Colleges\", which provide the final two years of secondary education (equivalent to sixth form in British terms or grades 11\u201312 in the American system). Since 1 January 2005, the term also refers to the three campuses of the [[Institute of Technical Education]] with the introduction of the \"collegiate system\", in which the three institutions are called [[ITE College East]], [[ITE College Central]], and [[ITE College West]] respectively.\n\nThe term \"university\" is used to describe higher-education institutions offering locally conferred degrees. Institutions offering diplomas are called \"[[Institute of technology|polytechnics]]\", while other institutions are often referred to as \"institutes\" and so forth.\n\n===South Africa===\nAlthough the term \"college\" is hardly used in any context at any university in South Africa, some non-university tertiary institutions call themselves colleges. These include teacher training colleges, business colleges and wildlife management colleges. See: [[List of universities in South Africa#Private colleges and universities]]; [[List of post secondary institutions in South Africa]].\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nThere are several professional and vocational institutions that offer post-secondary education without granting degrees that are referred to as \"colleges\". This includes the [[Sri Lanka Law College]], the many Technical Colleges and Teaching Colleges.\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:A view of Birkbeck, University of London.jpg|upright=1.25|[[Birkbeck, University of London]]|thumb]]\n\n====Secondary education and further education====\n\nFurther education (FE) colleges and [[sixth form college]]s are institutions providing further education to students over 16.

Traditionally the distinction between colleges and universities was that colleges did not award degrees while universities did, but this is no longer the case with [[Newcastle College#NCG|NCG]] having gained taught degree awarding powers (the same as some universities) on behalf of its colleges,<ref>{{cite news|title=Newcastle education group to become first in the country to award its own degree courses|date=29 June 2016|work=ChronicleLive|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-education-group-become-first-11539127|author=Keiran Southern|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918192508/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-education-group-become-first-11539127|archivedate=18 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and many of the [[colleges of the University of London]] holding full degree awarding powers and being effectively universities. Most colleges, however, do not hold their own degree awarding powers and continue to offer higher education courses that are validated by universities or other institutions that can award degrees.\n\nIn England, {{as of|2016|August|lc=y}}, over 60% of the higher education providers directly funded by [[HEFCE]] (208/340) are sixth-form or further education colleges, often termed colleges of further and higher education, along with 17 colleges of the University of London, one [[university college]], 100 universities, and 14 other providers (six of which use 'college' in their name).

The large constituent colleges of the [[University of London]] are effectively universities in their own right; colleges in some universities, including those of the [[University of the Arts London]] and smaller colleges of the [[University of London]], run their own degree courses but do not award degrees; those at the [[University of Roehampton]] provide accommodation and pastoral care as well as delivering the teaching on university courses; those at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] deliver some teaching on university courses as well as providing accommodation and pastoral care; and those in [[Durham University|Durham]], [[University of Kent|Kent]], [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] and [[University of York|York]] provide accommodation and pastoral care but do not normally participate in formal teaching. The legal status of these colleges also varies widely, with University of London colleges being independent corporations and recognised bodies, Oxbridge colleges, colleges of the [[University of the Highlands and Islands]] (UHI) and some Durham colleges being independent corporations and listed bodies, most Durham colleges being owned by the university but still listed bodies, and those of other collegiate universities not having formal recognition. When applying for undergraduate courses through [[UCAS]], University of London colleges are treated as independent providers, colleges of Oxford, Cambridge, Durham and UHI are treated as locations within the universities that can be selected by specifying a 'campus code' in addition to selecting the university, and colleges of other universities are not recognised.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.ucas.com|title=Search courses|publisher=UCAS|accessdate=28 August 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826142005/http://search.ucas.com/|archivedate=26 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/news/2004-durham-colleges|title=The Collegiate System at the University of Durham|author=R.

Americans \"go to college\" after [[High school (North America)|high school]], regardless of whether the specific institution is formally a college or a university. Some students choose to dual-enroll, by taking college classes while still in high school. The word and its derivatives are the standard terms used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with American post-secondary undergraduate education.\n\nStudents must pay for college before taking classes. Some borrow the money via loans, and some students fund their educations with cash, scholarships, or grants, or some combination of any two or more of those payment methods. In 2011, the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree. For state-owned schools (called \"public\" universities), the subsidy was given to the college, with the student benefiting from lower tuition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.air.org/focus-area/education/index.cfm?fa=viewContent&content_id=1288&id=6|title=Taxpayer Subsidies for Most Colleges and Universities Average Between $8,000 to More than $100,000 for Each Bachelor\u2019s Degree, New Study Finds|first=|last=Anonymous|date=24 December 2013|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230231938/http://www.air.org/focus-area/education/index.cfm?fa=viewContent&content_id=1288&id=6|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/dec03/w9720.html|title=State Education Subsidies Shift Students to Public Universities|website=www.nber.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924104945/http://www.nber.org/digest/dec03/w9720.html|archivedate=24 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The state subsidized on average 50% of public university tuition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/article-content/131372|title=Why Does Tuition Go Up?

Two-year colleges, also known as [[junior college|junior]] or [[community college]]s, usually offer an [[associate's degree]], and four-year colleges usually offer a [[bachelor's degree]]. Often, these are entirely [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] institutions, although some have [[graduate school]] programs.\n\nFour-year institutions in the U.S. that emphasize a [[liberal arts]] curriculum are known as [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts colleges]]. Until the 20th century, liberal arts, law, medicine, theology, and divinity were about the only form of higher education available in the United States.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Masci|first=David|title=Should colleges get back to basics?|publisher=CQ Research}}</ref> These schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the undergraduate level, although advanced research may still occur at these institutions.\n\nWhile there is no national standard in the United States, the term \"university\" primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and [[graduate education]]. A university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a [[liberal arts]] curriculum, also culminating in a [[bachelor's degree]]. What often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research. Often these would be called a School of Law or School of Medicine, (but may also be called a college of law, or a faculty of law). An exception is [[Vincennes University]], [[Indiana]], which is styled and chartered as a \"university\" even though almost all of its academic programs lead only to two-year associate degrees. Some institutions, such as [[Dartmouth College]] and [[The College of William & Mary]], have retained the term \"college\" in their names for historical reasons. In one unique case, [[Boston College]] and [[Boston University]], both located in Boston, Massachusetts, are completely separate institutions.\n\n[[File:BCburnslawnsunset.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boston College]]]]\nUsage of the terms varies among the states. In 1996 for example, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] changed all of its four-year institutions previously designated as colleges to universities, and all of its [[vocation]]al technology schools to [[Institute of technology|technical colleges]].\n\n[[File:Johnson Student Center and Freeman College Union.jpg|left|thumb|[[Occidental College]]]]\nThe terms \"university\" and \"college\" do not exhaust all possible titles for an American institution of higher education. Other options include \"Polytechnic\" ([[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]),  \"Institute of Technology\" ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]), \"academy\" ([[United States Military Academy]]), \"union\" ([[Cooper Union]]), \"conservatory\" ([[New England Conservatory]]), and \"school\" ([[Juilliard School]]). In colloquial use, they are still referred to as \"college\" when referring to their undergraduate studies.\n\nThe term ''college'' is also, as in the United Kingdom, used for a constituent semi-autonomous part of a larger university but generally organized on academic rather than residential lines. For example, at many institutions, the undergraduate portion of the university can be briefly referred to as '''the college''' (such as The [[College of the University of Chicago]], [[Harvard College]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], or [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] at [[Columbia University|Columbia]]) while at others, such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], each of the faculties may be called a \"college\" (the \"college of engineering\", the \"college of nursing\", and so forth). There exist other variants for historical reasons; for example, [[Duke University]], which was called Trinity College until the 1920s, still calls its main undergraduate subdivision [[Trinity College of Arts and Sciences]].\n\n====Residential colleges====\n[[File:Scripps College for Women-9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Scripps College]]]]\nSome American universities, such as [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Rice University|Rice]], and [[Yale University|Yale]] have established [[residential college]]s (sometimes, as at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], the first to establish such a system in the 1930s, known as houses) along the lines of Oxford or Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://collegiateway.org/reading/morison-1936/|title=Samuel Eliot Morison on the Harvard Houses|work=The Collegiate Way|author=Robert J.

The small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities \u2013 they were tiny and did not offer the higher degrees in medicine and theology. Furthermore, they were not composed of several small colleges. Instead, the new institutions felt like the Oxford and Cambridge colleges they were used to \u2013 small communities, housing and feeding their students, with instruction from residential tutors (as in the United Kingdom, described above). When the first students graduated, these \"colleges\" assumed the right to confer degrees upon them, usually with authority\u2014for example, [[The College of William & Mary]] has a [[Royal Charter]] from the British monarchy allowing it to confer degrees while [[Dartmouth College]] has a charter permitting it to award degrees \"as are usually granted in either of the universities, or any other college in our realm of Great Britain.\"\n\n[[File:Agnes Scott College - Buttrick Hall.jpg|right|thumb|[[Agnes Scott College]]]]\nThe leaders of [[Harvard College]] (which granted America's first degrees in 1642) might have thought of their college as the first of many residential colleges that would grow up into a New Cambridge university. However, over time, few new colleges were founded there, and Harvard grew and added higher faculties. Eventually, it changed its title to university, but the term \"college\" had stuck and \"colleges\" have arisen across the United States.\n\nIn U.S. usage, the word \"college\" embodies not only a particular type of school, but has historically been used to refer to the general concept of higher education when it is not necessary to specify a school, as in \"going to college\" or \"college savings accounts\" offered by banks.\n\nIn a survey of more than 2,000 college students in 33 states and 156 different campuses, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group found the average student spends as much as $1,200 each year on textbooks and supplies alone. By comparison, the group says that's the equivalent of 39 percent of tuition and fees at a community college, and 14 percent of tuition and fees at a four-year public university.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bidwell|first1=Allie|title=Report: High Textbook Prices Have College Students Struggling|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/28/report-high-textbook-prices-have-college-students-struggling|website=U.S. News|accessdate=2015-02-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227180009/http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/01/28/report-high-textbook-prices-have-college-students-struggling|archivedate=27 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Morrill Land-Grant Act====\n[[File:SUNY Purchase College.jpg|thumb|[[SUNY Purchase College]]]]\nIn addition to private colleges and universities, the U.S. also has a system of government funded, [[public university|public universities]].

He donated part of his fortune for the establishment of an \"industrial school\". Chalmers was run as a private institution until 1937, when the institute became a [[state-owned university]]. In 1994, the school was incorporated as an\n[[aktiebolag]] under the control of the Swedish Government, the faculty and the Student Union. Chalmers is one of only three universities in Sweden which are named after a person, the other two being [[Karolinska Institutet]] and [[Linnaeus University]].\n\n==Departments==\nBeginning 1 May 2017, Chalmers has 13 departments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chalmers.se/en/news/Pages/New-departmental-structure-.aspx|title=New organisation from 1 May|last=|first=|date=|website=www.chalmers.se|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-02}}</ref>\n* Architecture and Civil Engineering\n* Biology and Biological Engineering\n* Chemistry and Chemical Engineering\n* Communication and Learning in Science\n* Computer Science and Engineering\n* Electrical Engineering\n* Industrial and Materials Science\n* Mathematical Sciences\n* Mechanics and Maritime Sciences\n* Microtechnology and Nanoscience\n* Physics\n* Space, Earth and Environment\n* Technology Management and Economics\n\nFurthermore, Chalmers is home to eight Areas of Advance and six national competence centres in key fields like mathematical modelling, environmental science and vehicle safety.\n\n== Research infrastructure ==\nChalmers University of Technology's research infrastructure includes everything from advanced real or virtual labs to large databases, computer capacity for large-scale calculations and research facilities. \n* Chalmers Centre for Computational Science and Engineering, C3SE\n* Chalmers Mass Spectrometry Infrastructure, CMSI\n* Chalmers Power Central\n* Chalmers Materials Analysis Laboratory\n* Chalmers Simulator Centre\n* Chemical Imaging Infrastructure\n* Facility for Computational Systems Biology\n* HSB Living Lab\n* Nanofabrication Laboratory\n* Onsala Space Observatory\n* Revere \u2013 Chalmers Resource for Vehicle Research\n* The National laboratory in terahertz characterisation\n\n==Students==\nApproximately 40% of Sweden's graduate engineers and architects are educated at Chalmers. Each year, around 250 post graduate degrees are awarded as well as 850 graduate degrees. About 1,000 post-graduate students attend programmes at the university, and many students are taking Master of Science engineering programmes and the Master of Architecture programme. Since 2007, all master's programmes are taught in English for both national and international students. This was a result of the adaptation to the [[Bologna process]] that started in 2004 at Chalmers (as the first technical university in Sweden).\n\nCurrently, about 10% of all students at Chalmers come from countries outside Sweden to enroll in a master's or PhD program.\n\nAround 2,700 students also attend Bachelor of Science engineering programmes, merchant marine and other undergraduate courses at [[Chalmers Lindholmen University College|Campus Lindholmen]]. Chalmers also shares some students with Gothenburg University in the joint IT University project. The [[IT University]] focuses exclusively on information technology and offers bachelor's and master's programmes with degrees issued from either Chalmers or Gothenburg University, depending on the programme.\n\nChalmers confers honorary doctoral degrees to people outside the university who have shown great merit in their research or in society.\n\n== Organization ==\nChalmers is an [[aktiebolag]] with 100 shares \u00e0 1,000 [[Swedish Krona|SEK]],<ref>[http://www.chalmers.se/en/about-chalmers/chalmers-university-of-technology-foundation/Pages/statutes.aspx Statutes of Chalmers University of Technology Foundation, paragraph 3] (this is a translation of the [http://www.chalmers.se/sections/om_chalmers/stiftelsen_chalmers/stadgar swedish text] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506142310/http://www.chalmers.se/sections/om_chalmers/stiftelsen_chalmers/stadgar |date=6 May 2009 }}.)

The term is now usually only used of [[manuscript]] books, with hand-written contents,<ref>Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed: Codex: \"a manuscript volume\"</ref> but describes the format that is now near-universal for printed books in the Western world.  The book is usually bound by stacking the pages and fixing one edge to a [[bookbinding]], which may just be thicker paper ([[paperback]] or [[softback]]), or with stiff boards, called a [[hardback]], or in elaborate historical examples a [[treasure binding]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}.\n\nAt least in the Western world, the main alternative to the paged codex format for a long document is the continuous [[scroll]], which was the dominant book form in the [[Classical antiquity|ancient world]].  Some codices are continuously folded like a [[concertina]], in particular the [[Maya codices|Maya]] and [[Aztec codices]], which are actually long sheets of paper or animal skin folded into pages.  These do not really meet most current definitions of the \"codex\" form, but are so called by convention.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] developed the form from wooden [[Wax tablet|writing tablets]]. The codex's gradual replacement of the scroll has been called the most important advance in book making before the invention of [[Printing press|printing]].<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=1}}</ref> The codex transformed the shape of the book itself, and offered a form that lasted until present day (and continues to be used alongside [[e-paper]]).<ref>Lyons, M., (2011).

In fact, any combination of codices and scrolls with papyrus and parchment is technically feasible and common in the historical record.<ref>{{harvnb|Roberts|Skeat|1983|p=5}}</ref>\n\nThe codex began to replace the [[scroll]] almost as soon as it was invented. In [[Egypt]], by the fifth century, the codex outnumbered the scroll by ten to one based on surviving examples. By the sixth century, the scroll had almost vanished as a medium for literature.<ref>Roberts, Colin H., and Skeat, T.C. (1987), ''The Birth of the Codex''. London: [[Oxford University Press]] for the [[British Academy]], p. 75.</ref>\n\nTechnically, even modern [[paperback]]s are codices, but publishers and scholars reserve the term for [[manuscript]] (hand-written) books produced from [[Late antiquity]] until the [[Middle Ages]]. The scholarly study of these manuscripts from the point of view of the [[bookbinding]] craft is called [[codicology]]. The study of ancient documents in general is called [[paleography]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Wachstafel rem.jpg|thumb|Reproduced Roman-style [[wax tablet]], from which the codex evolved]]\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used precursors made of reusable [[Wax tablet|wax-covered tablets of wood]] for taking notes and other informal writings.

He wrote a series of five [[couplet]]s meant to accompany gifts of literature that Romans exchanged during the festival of [[Saturnalia]]. Three of these books are specifically described by Martial as being in the form of a codex; the poet praises the compendiousness of the form (as opposed to the scroll), as well the convenience with which such a book can be read on a journey. In another poem by Martial, the poet advertises a new edition of his works, specifically noting that it is printed as a codex, taking less space than a scroll and more comfortable to hold in one hand. According to [[Theodore Cressy Skeat]], this might be the first recorded known case of an entire edition of a literary work (not just a single copy) being published in codex form, though it was likely an isolated case and was not a common practice until a much later time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Skeat|first= T.C.|title=The Collected Biblical Writings of T.C.

The [[parchment]] notebook pages were commonly washed or scraped for re-use (called a [[palimpsest]]) and consequently, writings in a codex were often considered informal and impermanent.\n\nAs early as the early 2nd century, there is evidence that a codex\u2014usually of [[papyrus]]\u2014was the preferred format among [[Christianity|Christians]]. In the library of the [[Villa of the Papyri]], [[Herculaneum]] (buried in AD 79), all the texts (of Greek literature) are scrolls (see [[Herculaneum papyri]]). However, in the [[Nag Hammadi library]], hidden about AD 390, all texts (Gnostic Christian) are codices. Despite this comparison, a fragment of a non-Christian parchment codex of [[Demosthenes]]' ''De Falsa Legatione'' from [[Oxyrhynchus Papyri|Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt demonstrates that the surviving evidence is insufficient to conclude whether Christians played a major or central role in the development of early codices\u2014or if they simply adopted the format to distinguish themselves from [[Jews]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe earliest surviving fragments from codices come from Egypt, and are variously dated (always tentatively) towards the end of the 1st century or in the first half of the 2nd. This group includes the [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], containing part of St John's Gospel, and perhaps dating from between 125 and 160.<ref>Turner ''The Typology of the Early Codex'', U Penn 1977, and Roberts & Skeat ''The Birth of the Codex'' (Oxford University 1983). From Robert A Kraft (see link): \"A fragment of a Latin parchment codex of an otherwise unknown historical text dating to about 100 CE was also found at Oxyrhynchus ([[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 30|P. Oxy. 30]]; see Roberts & Skeat 28).

Between the 4th century, when the codex gained wide acceptance, and the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 8th century, many works that were not converted from scroll to codex were lost. The codex improved on the scroll in several ways. It could be opened flat at any page for easier reading, pages could be written on both front and back ([[recto and verso]]), and the protection of durable covers made it more compact and easier to transport.\n\nThe ancients stored codices with spines facing inward, and not always vertically. The spine could be used for the [[incipit]], before the concept of a proper title developed in medieval times. Though most early codices were made of [[papyrus]], papyrus was fragile and supplies from Egypt, the only place where papyrus grew and was made into paper, became scanty. The more durable [[parchment]] and [[vellum]] gained favor, despite the cost.\n[[File:Codex Mendoza folio 37r.jpg|Folio 37 recto|thumb|right|[[Aztec codices|Aztec codex]] of the early 16th c., [[Codex Mendoza]], showing tribute obligations of particular indigenous towns]]\nThe codices of [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]] (Mexico and Central America) had the same form as the European codex, but were instead made with long folded strips of either fig bark ([[amatl]]) or plant fibers, often with a layer of [[whitewash]] applied before writing. [[New World]] codices were written as late as the 16th century (see [[Maya codices]] and [[Aztec codices]]). Those written before the Spanish conquests seem all to have been single long sheets folded [[concertina]]-style, sometimes written on both sides of the local ''[[amatl]]'' paper. There are significant codices produced in the colonial era, with pictorial and alphabetic texts in Spanish or an indigenous language such as [[Nahuatl]].\n\nIn [[East Asia]], the scroll remained standard for far longer than in the [[Mediterranean]] world. There were intermediate stages, such as scrolls folded [[concertina]]-style and pasted together at the back and books that were printed only on one side of the paper.<ref>[http://idp.bl.uk/education/bookbinding/bookbinding.a4d [[International Dunhuang Project]]\u2014Several intermediate Chinese bookbinding forms from the 10th century].</ref> This replaced traditional Chinese writing mediums such as [[bamboo and wooden slips]], as well as [[History of silk|silk]] and paper scrolls.<ref>{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|page=227|postscript=.}}</ref> The evolution of the codex in [[History of China|China]] began with folded-leaf [[pamphlet]]s in the 9th century AD, during the late [[Tang Dynasty]] (618-907 AD), improved by the 'butterfly' bindings of the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 AD), the wrapped back binding of the [[Yuan dynasty]] (1271-1368), the stitched binding of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] (1368-1644 AD) and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (1644-1912), and finally the adoption of Western-style bookbinding in the 20th century.<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\">{{cite book |first2=Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-hsuin |first1=Joseph |last1=Needham |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |year=1985 |title=Science and Civilization in China: Volume 5: Chemistry and Chemical Technology, Part 1: Paper and Printing |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-08690-6|pages=227\u2013229|postscript=.}}</ref> The initial phase of this evolution, the accordion-folded palm-leaf-style book, most likely came from [[India]] and was introduced to China via [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist missionaries and scriptures]].<ref name=\"Cambridge University Press\"/>\n\n[[Judaism]] still retains the [[Torah]] scroll, at least for ceremonial use.\n\n==From scrolls to codex==\n[[File:Codex Aureus Sankt Emmeram.jpg|thumb|The cover of the [[Carolingian]] gospel book ''Codex Aureus of Sankt Emmeram'', produced ca. 870 AD at the [[Palace of Aachen]], during the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles the Bald]]]]\nAmong the experiments of earlier centuries, scrolls were sometimes unrolled horizontally, as a succession of columns. (The [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] are a famous example of this format.) This made it possible to fold the scroll as an accordion. The next step was then to cut the [[Folio (printing)|folios]], sew and glue them at their centers, making it easier to use the [[papyrus]] or [[vellum]] [[Recto and verso|recto-verso]] as with a modern book. Traditional bookbinders would call one of these assembled, trimmed and bound folios a ''codex'' to differentiate it from the ''case,'' which we now know as ''hard cover''. Binding the codex was clearly a different procedure from binding the case.\n\n==Preparing a codex==\n{{see|Parchment}}\nThe first stage in creating a codex is to prepare the animal skin. The skin is washed with water and lime, but not together, and it has to soak in the lime for a couple of days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/making/ |title=The Making of a Medieval Book |publisher=The J. Paul Getty Trust |accessdate=19 November 2010}}</ref> The hair is removed and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame called a herse.<ref name=\"Intro\">Clemens, Raymond, and Timothy Graham. Introduction to Manuscript Studies. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008.</ref> The parchment maker attaches the skin at points around the circumference. The skin attaches to the herse by cords. To prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin attached to the cord around a pebble called a pippin.<ref name=\"Intro\" /> After completing that, the maker uses a crescent shaped knife called a ''lunarium'' or ''lunellum'' to remove any remaining hairs. Once the skin completely dries, the maker gives it a deep clean and processes it into sheets. The number of sheets from a piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the final product dimensions. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a ''bifolium''. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.<ref name=\"daniel\">Thompson, Daniel. \"Medieval Parchment-Making.\" The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).</ref> Defects can often be found in the membrane, whether from the original animal, human error during the preparation period, or from when the animal was killed. Defects can also appear during the writing process. Unless it is kept in perfect condition, defects can appear later in the manuscript's life as well.\n\n===Preparation of the pages for writing===\n[[File:Codex Manesse 193r - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|Manuscript, [[Codex Manesse]]. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered.]]\nFirst the membrane must be prepared. The first step is to set up the quires. The quire is a group of several sheets put together. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in \"Introduction to Manuscript Studies\", that \u201cthe quire was the scribe\u2019s basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages\u201d.<ref name=\"Intro\"/> They note \u201cPricking is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of it ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns.\u201d<ref name=\"Intro\"/>\n\n===Forming the quire===\nFrom the Carolingian period and all the way up to the Middle Ages, different styles of folding the quire came about. For example, in mainland Europe throughout the Middle Ages, the quire was put into a system in which each side folded on to the same style. The hair side met the hair side and the flesh side to the flesh side. This was not the same style used in the British Isles, where the membrane was folded so that it turned out an eight-leaf quire, with single leaves in the third and sixth positions.<ref name=\"Intro\" /> The next stage was tacking the quire. Tacking is when the scribe would hold together the leaves in quire with thread. Once threaded together, the scribe would then sew a line of parchment up the \u201cspine\u201d of the manuscript, as to protect the tacking.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aztec codices]]\n*[[History of books]]\n*[[List of codices]]\n*[[List of florilegia and botanical codices]]\n*[[List of New Testament papyri]]\n*[[List of New Testament uncials]]\n*[[Maya codices]]\n*[[Traditional Chinese bookbinding]]\n*[[Volume (bibliography)]]\n\n==References and sources==\n===References===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Sources===\n* [[David Diringer]], ''The Book Before Printing: Ancient, Medieval and Oriental'', Courier Dover Publications, New York 1982, {{ISBN|0-486-24243-9}}\n* [[Larry Hurtado|L.

They usually stand within a few minutes of calving, and suckle within an hour. However, for the first few days they are not easily able to keep up with the rest of the herd, so young calves are often left hidden by their mothers, who visit them several times a day to suckle them. By a week old the calf is able to follow the mother all the time.\n\nSome calves are [[ear tag]]ged soon after birth, especially those that are [[Stud_(animal)|stud cattle]] in order to correctly identify their dams (mothers), or in areas (such as the [[European Union|EU]]) where tagging is a legal requirement for cattle. A calf must have the very best of everything until it is at least eight months old if it is to reach its maximum potential.<ref>{{cite book |last= Beattie |first= William A. |coauthors= |title= Beef Cattle Breeding & Management |publisher= Popular Books, Frenchs Forest |year= 1990 |month= |isbn= 0-7301-0040-5}}</ref> Typically when the calves are about two months old they are branded, ear marked, castrated and [[vaccinate]]d.\n\n== Calf rearing systems ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2009}}\nThe ''single suckler'' system of rearing calves is similar to that occurring naturally in wild cattle, where each calf is suckled by its own mother until it is weaned at about nine months old. This system is commonly used for rearing [[beef cattle]] throughout the world.\n\nCows kept on poor forage (as is typical in [[subsistence farming]]) produce a limited amount of milk. A calf left with such a mother all the time can easily drink all the milk, leaving none for human consumption. For dairy production under such circumstances, the calf's access to the cow must be limited, for example by penning the calf and bringing the mother to it once a day after partly milking her. The small amount of milk available for the calf under such systems may mean that it takes a longer time to rear, and in subsistence farming it is therefore common for cows to calve only in alternate years.\n\nIn more intensive [[dairy farming]], cows can easily be bred and fed to produce far more milk than one calf can drink. In the ''multi-suckler'' system, several calves are fostered onto one cow in addition to her own, and these calves' mothers can then be used wholly for milk production. More commonly, calves of dairy cows are fed formula milk from a bottle or bucket from soon after birth.\n\nPurebred female calves of [[Dairy cattle|dairy cows]] are reared as replacement dairy cows. Most purebred dairy calves are produced by artificial insemination (AI). By this method each bull can serve very many cows, so only a very few of the purebred dairy male calves are needed to provide bulls for breeding. The remainder of the male calves may be reared for beef or veal; however, some extreme dairy breeds carry so little muscle that rearing the purebred male calves may be uneconomic, and in this case they are often killed soon after birth and disposed of. Only a proportion of purebred heifers are needed to provide replacement cows, so often some of the cows in dairy herds are put to a beef bull to produce crossbred calves suitable for rearing as beef.\n\nVeal calves may be reared entirely on milk formula and killed at about 18 or 20 weeks as \"white\" veal, or fed on grain and hay and killed at 22 to 35 weeks to produce red or pink veal.\n\n== Growth ==\n[[File:Vaca.JPG|thumb|[[Ear tag]]ged calf and cow in [[Andorra]].]]\n[[File:Calf suckling at a meadow near Vrachesh, Bulgaria.webm|thumb|Video of calf suckling in [[Bulgaria]]]]\nA commercial steer or bull calf is expected to put on about {{Convert|32|to|36|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} per month. A nine-month-old steer or bull is therefore expected to weigh about {{Convert|250|to|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}}. Heifers will weigh at least {{Convert|200|kg|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} at eight months of age.\n\nCalves are usually weaned at about eight to nine months of age, but depending on the season and condition of the dam, they might be weaned earlier. They may be paddock weaned, often next to their mothers, or weaned in [[Feedlot|stockyards]]. The latter system is preferred by some as it accustoms the weaners to the presence of people and they are trained to take feed other than grass.<ref name=\"Cole\">{{cite book |last= Cole B.V.Sc. |first= V.G. |coauthors= |title= Beef Production Guide |publisher= Macarthur Press, Parramatta |year= 1978 |month= |isbn= 0-9599973-1-8}}</ref> Small numbers may also be weaned with their dams with the use of weaning [[nose ring (animals)|nose rings]] or nosebands which results in the mothers rejecting the calves' attempts to suckle. Many calves are also weaned when they are taken to the large weaner [[auction]] sales that are conducted in the south eastern states of Australia. Victoria and [[New South Wales]] have yardings{{clarify|post-text=Please explain yardings|date=April 2011}} of up to 8,000 weaners (calves) for [[auction]] sale in one day.<ref>The Land, 16 April 2009, \"CTLX Carcoar Blue Ribbon Weaner Sale\", p. 13, Rural Press, North Richmond</ref> The best of these weaners may go to the butchers. Others will be purchased by re-stockers to grow out and fatten on grass or as potential breeders. In the United States these weaners may be known as ''feeders'' and would be placed directly into [[feedlot]]s.\n\nAt about 12 months old a beef heifer reaches puberty if she is well grown.<ref name=\"Cole\" />\n\n== Diseases ==\nCalves suffer from few congenital abnormalities but the [[Akabane virus]] is widely distributed in [[temperate]] to [[Tropics|tropical]] regions of the world. The virus is a teratogenic pathogen which causes [[abortion]]s, stillbirths, premature births and congenital abnormalities, but occurs only during some years.\n\n== Uses ==\nCalf meat for [[human]] consumption is called [[veal]], and is usually produced from the male calves of [[Dairy cattle]].  Also eaten are [[calf's brains]] and [[calf liver]]. The [[Hide (skin)|hide]] is used to make [[calfskin]], or tanned into leather and called calf leather, or sometimes in the US \"novillo\", the Spanish term. The fourth compartment of the stomach of slaughtered milk-fed calves is the source of [[rennet]]. The [[intestine]] is used to make [[Goldbeater's skin]], and is the source of [[Calf Intestinal Alkaline Phosphatase (CIP)]].\n\nDairy cows can only produce milk after having calved, and dairy cows need to produce one calf each year in order to remain in production. Female calves will become a replacement dairy cow.

Shannon's mother, [[Mabel Wolf Shannon]] (1890\u20131945), was a language teacher, and also served as the principal of [[Gaylord High School]].\n\nMost of the first 16 years of Shannon's life were spent in Gaylord, where he attended public school, graduating from [[Gaylord High School]] in 1932. Shannon showed an inclination towards mechanical and electrical things. His best subjects were science and mathematics. At home he constructed such devices as models of planes, a radio-controlled model boat and a barbed-wire [[telegraph]] system to a friend's house a half-mile away.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/30/magazine/the-lives-they-lived-claude-shannon-b-1916-bit-player.html?mcubz=1 \"The Lives They Lived: Claude Shannon\", ''New York Times'', 30 December 2001]</ref> While growing up, he also worked as a messenger for the [[Western Union]] company.\n\nHis childhood hero was [[Thomas Edison]], who he later learned was a distant cousin.

He graduated in 1936 with two [[bachelor's degree]]s: one in [[electrical engineering]] and the other in [[mathematics]].\n\nIn 1936, Shannon began his graduate studies in [[electrical engineering]] at [[MIT]], where he worked on [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[differential analyzer]], an early [[analog computer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Claude_E._Shannon |title=Claude E.

Next, he expanded this concept, proving that these circuits could solve all problems that [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] could solve. In the last chapter, he presented diagrams of several circuits, including a 4-bit full adder.<ref name=\"SymbolicAnalysis\" />\n\nUsing this property of electrical switches to implement logic is the fundamental concept that underlies all [[Computer|electronic digital computers]]. Shannon's work became the foundation of [[digital circuit]] design, as it became widely known in the electrical engineering community during and after [[World War II]]. The theoretical rigor of Shannon's work superseded the ''ad hoc'' methods that had prevailed previously. [[Howard Gardner]] called Shannon's thesis \"possibly the most important, and also the most noted, master's thesis of the century.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=The Mind's New Science: A History of the Cognitive Revolution |first=Howard |last=Gardner |authorlink=Howard Gardner |publisher=Basic Books |year=1987 |isbn=0-465-04635-5 |page=144}}</ref>\n\nShannon received his Ph.D. degree from MIT in 1940. Vannevar Bush had suggested that Shannon should work on his dissertation at the [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]], in order to develop a mathematical formulation for [[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[genetics]]. This research resulted in Shannon's PhD thesis, called ''An Algebra for Theoretical Genetics.<ref>C. E.

In Princeton, Shannon had the opportunity to discuss his ideas with influential scientists and [[mathematician]]s such as [[Hermann Weyl]] and [[John von Neumann]], and he also had occasional encounters with [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]. Shannon worked freely across disciplines, and this ability may have contributed to his later development of mathematical [[information theory]].<ref>Erico Marui Guizzo, \u201c[http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/39429/54526133-MIT.pdf?sequence=2 The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory]\u201d (M.S.

Inside the volume on fire control, a special essay titled ''Data Smoothing and Prediction in Fire-Control Systems'', coauthored by Shannon, [[Ralph Beebe Blackman]], and [[Hendrik Wade Bode]], formally treated the problem of smoothing the data in fire-control by analogy with \"the problem of separating a signal from interfering noise in communications systems.\"<ref>David A.

A declassified version of this paper was published in 1949 as \"[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]\" in the ''[[Bell System Technical Journal]]''. This paper incorporated many of the concepts and mathematical formulations that also appeared in his ''[[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]]''. Shannon said that his wartime insights into communication theory and cryptography developed simultaneously and that \"they were so close together you couldn\u2019t separate them\".<ref>quoted in Kahn, ''The Codebreakers'', p. 744.</ref> In a footnote near the beginning of the classified report, Shannon announced his intention to \"develop these results \u2026 in a forthcoming memorandum on the transmission of information.\"<ref>quoted in Erico Marui Guizzo, [http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf \"The Essential Message: Claude Shannon and the Making of Information Theory,\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528182200/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/1721.1/39429/1/54526133.pdf |date=May 28, 2008 }} unpublished MS thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2003, p. 21.</ref>\n\nWhile he was at Bell Labs, Shannon proved that the [[cryptographic]] [[one-time pad]] is unbreakable in his classified research that was later published in October 1949. He also proved that any unbreakable system must have essentially the same characteristics as the one-time pad: the key must be truly random, as large as the plaintext, never reused in whole or part, and be kept secret.<ref>Shannon, Claude (1949). \"Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems\". Bell System Technical Journal 28 (4): 656\u2013715.</ref>\n\n===Information theory===\nIn 1948, the promised memorandum appeared as \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication,\" an article in two parts in the July and October issues of the ''Bell System Technical Journal''. This work focuses on the problem of how best to encode the [[information]] a sender wants to transmit. In this fundamental work, he used tools in probability theory, developed by [[Norbert Wiener]], which were in their nascent stages of being applied to communication theory at that time. Shannon developed [[information entropy]] as a measure of the uncertainty in a message while essentially inventing the field of [[information theory]].\n\nThe book, co-authored with [[Warren Weaver]], ''The Mathematical Theory of Communication'', reprints Shannon's 1948 article and Weaver's popularization of it, which is accessible to the non-specialist. Warren Weaver pointed out that the word \"information\" in communication theory is not related to what you do say, but to what you could say. That is, information is a measure of one's freedom of choice when one selects a message. Shannon's concepts were also popularized, subject to his own proofreading, in [[John Robinson Pierce]]'s ''Symbols, Signals, and Noise''.\n\nInformation theory's fundamental contribution to [[natural language processing]] and [[computational linguistics]] was further established in 1951, in his article \"Prediction and Entropy of Printed English\", showing upper and lower bounds of entropy on the statistics of English \u2013 giving a statistical foundation to language analysis. In addition, he proved that treating [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] as the 27th letter of the alphabet actually lowers uncertainty in written language, providing a clear quantifiable link between cultural practice and probabilistic cognition.\n\nAnother notable paper published in 1949 is \"[[Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems]]\", a declassified version of his wartime work on the mathematical theory of cryptography, in which he proved that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. He is also credited with the introduction of [[Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem|sampling theory]], which is concerned with representing a continuous-time signal from a (uniform) discrete set of samples. This theory was essential in enabling telecommunications to move from analog to digital transmissions systems in the 1960s and later.\n\nHe returned to MIT to hold an endowed chair in 1956.\n\n===Teaching at MIT===\nIn 1956 Shannon joined the MIT faculty to work in the [[Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT|Research Laboratory of Electronics]] (RLE). He continued to serve on the MIT faculty until 1978.\n\n===Later life===\nShannon developed [[Alzheimer's disease]] and spent the last few years of his life in a [[nursing home]] in [[Massachusetts]] oblivious to the marvels of the [[digital revolution]] he had helped create. He died in 2001. He was survived by his wife, Mary Elizabeth Moore Shannon, his son, Andrew Moore Shannon, his daughter, Margarita Shannon, his sister, Catherine Shannon Kay, and his two granddaughters.<ref name =SW>{{cite web| url=http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/biography/Shannon.html | title=Shannon, Claude Elwood (1916\u20132001) | first=Eric | last=Weisstein | work=World of Scientific Biography | publisher=[[Wolfram Research]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thocp.net/biographies/shannon_claude.htm | title=Claude Shannon \u2013 computer science theory | work=www.thocp.net | publisher=The History of Computing Project | accessdate=9 December 2016}}</ref> His wife stated in his obituary that, had it not been for Alzheimer's disease, \"He would have been bemused\" by it all.<ref name=\"star ledger\" />\n\n=== Hobbies and inventions ===\n\n[[File:Minivac 601.jpg|thumb|The [[Minivac 601]], a digital computer trainer designed by Shannon.]]\n\nOutside of Shannon's academic pursuits, he was interested in [[juggling]], [[unicycling]], and [[chess]].

Its dimensions were the same as those of an average mouse.<ref name=\"Bell Labs acknowledgement\" /> The maze configuration was flexible and it could be modified arbitrarily by rearranging movable partitions.<ref name=\"Bell Labs acknowledgement\" /> The mouse was designed to search through the corridors until it found the target. Having travelled through the maze, the mouse could then be placed anywhere it had been before, and because of its prior experience it could go directly to the target. If placed in unfamiliar territory, it was programmed to search until it reached a known location and then it would proceed to the target, adding the new knowledge to its memory and learning new behavior.<ref name=\"Bell Labs acknowledgement\" /> Shannon's mouse appears to have been the first artificial learning device of its kind.<ref name=\"Bell Labs acknowledgement\" />\n\n===Shannon's estimate for the complexity of chess===\n{{Main|Shannon number}}\nIn 1949 Shannon completed a paper (published in March 1950) which estimates the [[Game complexity|game-tree complexity]] of [[chess]], which is approximately 10<sup>120</sup>. This number is now often referred to as the \"Shannon number\", and is still regarded today as an accurate estimate of the game's complexity.

He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950 it was published in Philosophical Magazine, and is considered one of the first articles published on the topic of programming a computer for playing chess, and using a computer to [[Solving chess|solve the game]].<ref name=\"CS\"/><ref>http://billwall.phpwebhosting.com/articles/computer_early_chess.htm</ref> His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a [[minimax]] procedure, based on an [[evaluation function]] of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an evaluation function in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. ''Material'' was counted according to the usual [[chess piece relative value]] (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen).<ref>{{Citation | title = Artificial dreams: the quest for non-biological intelligence | author = Hamid Reza Ekbia | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-521-87867-8 | page = 46 | publisher = Cambridge University Press }}</ref> He considered some positional factors, subtracting \u00bd point for each [[doubled pawn]], [[backward pawn]], and [[isolated pawn]]. Another positional factor in the evaluation function was ''[[mobility (chess)|mobility]]'', adding 0.1 point for each legal move available. Finally, he considered [[checkmate]] to be the capture of the king, and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points. Quoting from the paper:\n\n:The coefficients .5 and .1 are merely the writer's rough estimate. Furthermore, there are many other terms that should be included. The formula is given only for illustrative purposes. Checkmate has been artificially included here by giving the king the large value 200 (anything greater than the maximum of all other terms would do).\n\nThe evaluation function was clearly for illustrative purposes, as Shannon stated. For example, according to the function, pawns that are doubled as well as isolated would have no value at all, which is clearly unrealistic.\n\n===Shannon's maxim===\nShannon formulated a version of [[Kerckhoffs's principle|Kerckhoffs' principle]] as \"The enemy knows the system\". In this form it is known as \"Shannon's maxim\".\n\n==Commemorations==\n\n===Shannon Centenary===\n{{Update-section|date=April 2016}}\n[[File:Claude Shannon Centenary Logo.jpg|thumb|Claude Shannon Centenary]]\nThe Shannon Centenary, 2016, marked the life and influence of Claude Elwood Shannon on the hundredth anniversary of his birth on April 30, 1916.

Communities often share a sense of [[place (geography)|place]] that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social [[institution]]s (such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at-large).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url= http://www.sociologyencyclopedia.com/public/tocnode?query=community&widen=1&result_number=1&from=search&id=g9781405124331_yr2015_chunk_g97814051243319_ss1-77&type=std&fuzzy=0&slop=1|title= Community : The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology : Blackwell Encyclopedia of SociolOnline|website= www.sociologyencyclopedia.com|access-date= 2016-07-01}}</ref>{{qn|date=June 2018}}<ref>{{Cite book|last1= James|first1= Paul|authorlink= Paul James (academic)|last2= Nadarajah|first2= Yaso|last3= Haive|first3= Karen|last4= Stead|first4= Victoria| title= Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea|url= https://www.academia.edu/3230875/Sustainable_Communities_Sustainable_Development_Other_Paths_for_Papua_New_Guinea_author_with_Nadarajah_Stead_and_Have_University_of_Hawaii_Press_Honolulu_2012|year= 2012|page= 14|publisher= University of Hawaii Press|location= Honolulu  | quote = [...] we define community very broadly as a group or network of persons who are connected (objectively) to each other by relatively durable social relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties and who mutually define that relationship (subjectively) as important to their social identity and social practice.}}</ref> Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \"community\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as [[nation|national communities]], [[international community|international communities]], and [[virtual community|virtual communities]].<ref>\nSee also:  \n{{Cite book\n|last= James|first= Paul |authorlink= Paul James (academic)\n|title= Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In \u2014Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community\n|url= https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006\n|year= 2006|publisher= Sage Publications\n|location= London \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe English-language word \"community\" derives from the [[Old French]] ''comunet\u00e9'', which comes from the [[Latin]] ''[[communitas]]'' \"community\", \"public spirit\" (from Latin ''[[wikt:communis|communis]]'', \"shared in common\").<ref>\n\"community\" Oxford Dictionaries.

The first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient [[Human settlement|settlement]], whether a [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]], [[village]], [[town]], or [[city]]. The second meaning is similar to the usage of the term in other [[social sciences]]: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. [[Social interaction]] on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction is conditioned by physical distance. Therefore, a small village settlement likely constituted a social community, and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in [[material culture]]\u2014from house types to styles of pottery\u2014to reconstruct communities in the past. This is based on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.<ref>Canuto, Marcello A. and Jason Yaeger (editors) (2000) ''The Archaeology of Communities''.

In ''Seeking the Center: Archaeology and Ancient Communities in the Mesa Verde Region,'' edited by Mark D. Varien and Richard H. Wilshusen, pp. 263\u2013279. University of Utah Press, Salt Lake City.</ref>\n\n===Ecology===\n{{main|Community (ecology)}}\n\nIn ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of different species, interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of [[ecology]] that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the [[abiotic]] environment, affect community structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: [[competition]], [[predation]] and [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. Competition typically results in a double negative\u2014that is both species lose in the interaction. Predation is a win/lose situation with one species winning. Mutualism, on the other hand, involves both species cooperating in some way, with both winning. The two main types of communities are major which are self-sustaining and self-regulating (such as a forest or a lake) and minor communities which rely on other communities (like fungi decomposing a log) and are the building blocks of major communities.\n[[File:IB Biology Figure Project (1).svg|thumb|This is a simplified example of a community. A community includes many populations and how they interact with each other. In this example there's an interaction between the zebra and the bush, and the lion and the zebra, as well as the bird and the organisms by the water, like the worms.]]\n\n==Key concepts==\n\n===''Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft''===\n{{main|Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft}}\n\nIn ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'' (1887), German sociologist [[Ferdinand T\u00f6nnies]] described two types of human association: ''Gemeinschaft'' (usually translated as \"community\") and ''Gesellschaft'' (\"society\" or \"association\"). T\u00f6nnies proposed the ''Gemeinschaft\u2013Gesellschaft'' [[dichotomy]] as a way to think about social ties. No group is exclusively one or the other. ''Gemeinschaft'' stress personal [[social interaction]]s, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions. ''Gesellschaft'' stress indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions.<ref>T\u00f6nnies, Ferdinand (1887). ''Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft'', Leipzig: Fues's Verlag.  An English translation of the 8th edition 1935 by Charles P. Loomis appeared in 1940 as ''Fundamental Concepts of Sociology (Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft)'', New York: American Book Co.;  in 1955 as ''Community and Association (Gemeinschaft und gesellschaft''[sic]'')'', London:  Routledge & Kegan Paul;  and in 1957 as ''Community and Society'', East Lansing: Michigan State U.P.  Loomis includes as an Introduction, representing T\u00f6nnies' \"most recent thinking\", his 1931 article \"Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft\" in ''Handw\u00f6rterbuch der Soziologie'' (Stuttgart, Enke V.).</ref>\n\n===Internet communities===\nGroups of people are complex, in ways that make those groups hard to form and hard to sustain; much of the shape of traditional institutions is a response to those difficulties. New social tools relieve some of those burdens, allowing for new kinds of group-forming, like using simple sharing to anchor the creation of new groups.\n\nOne simple form of cooperation, almost universal with social tools, is conversation; when people are in one another's company, even virtually, they like to talk. Conversation creates more of a sense of community than sharing does.\n\nCollaborative production is a more involved form of cooperation, as it increases the tension between individual and group goals. The litmus test for collaborative production is simple: no one person can take credit for what gets created, and the project could not come into being without the participation of many.\n\nAn online community builds weaker bonds if allows users to be anonymous. [[Clay Shirky]], a researcher on digital media, states in reference to the audience of an online community, \"An audience isn\u2019t just a big community; it can be more anonymous, with many fewer ties among users. A community isn\u2019t just a small audience either; it has a social density that audiences lack.\" The sites that offer online communities, like [[Myspace]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]],  [[Instagram]], [[Tumblr]], and [[Pinterest]] allow users to \"stalk\" their community and act anonymously.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Here Comes Everybody|last=Skirty|first=Clay|publisher=Penguin Group|year=2008|isbn=978-1-59420-153-0|location=|pages=Chapter 2}}</ref>\n\n===Organizational communication===\n{{main|Organizational communication}}\n\nEffective [[communication]] practices in group and organizational settings are very important to the formation and maintenance of communities. The ways that ideas and values are communicated within communities are important to the induction of new members, the formulation of agendas, the selection of leaders and many other aspects. Organizational communication is the study of how people communicate within an organizational context and the influences and interactions within [[organizational structure]]s. Group members depend on the flow of communication to establish their own identity within these structures and learn to function in the group setting. Although organizational communication, as a field of study, is usually geared toward companies and business groups, these may also be seen as communities. The principles of organizational communication can also be applied to other types of communities.\n\n===Public administration===\n[[Public administration]] is the province of local, state and federal governments, with local governments responsible for units in towns, cities, villages, and counties, among others. The most well known \"community department\" is housing and community development which has responsibility for both economic development initiatives, and  as public housing and community infrastructure (e.g., business development).\n\n===Sense of community===\n{{main|Sense of community}}\n\nIn a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis<ref>McMillan, D.W., & Chavis, D.M. 1986. \"Sense of community: A definition and theory,\" p. 16.</ref>}} identify four elements of \"sense of community\":\n\n# membership,\n# influence,\n# integration and fulfillment of needs,\n# shared emotional connection.\n\n[[File:Bigdayout crowd2.jpg|thumb|To what extent do participants in joint activities experience a [[sense of community]]?]]\n\nA \"sense of community index'' (SCI) was developed by Chavis and colleagues, and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities.<ref>Perkins, D.D., Florin, P., Rich, R.C., Wandersman, A. & Chavis, D.M.

The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which [[individual]]s develop the skills and knowledge and learn the [[role]]s necessary to function within their [[culture]] and [[social environment]].<ref name=Socialization>Newman, D. 2005. [http://www.pineforge.com/upm-data/9006_Chapter_5.pdf Chapter 5. \"Building Identity: Socialization\"] pp. 134\u2013140.</ref> For some psychologists, especially those in the [[psychodynamic]] tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.<ref>Newman, D. 2005, p. 141.</ref>\n\nSocialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. Other important influences include schools, [[Peer group|peer]] groups, people, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of [[Toleration|tolerance]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] are important \"habits of the heart,\" as [[Alexis de Tocqueville|de Tocqueville]] put it, in an individual's involvement in community.<ref name=Community>Smith, M. 2001. [http://www.infed.org/community/community.htm Community].</ref>\n\n==Community development==\n{{main|Community development}}\n\nCommunity development is often linked with [[community work]] or community planning, and may involve stakeholders, foundations, governments, or contracted entities including [[non-government organisations]] (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. More grassroots efforts, called [[community building]] or [[community organizing]], seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.<ref>Kelly, Anthony, \"With Head, Heart and Hand: Dimensions of Community Building\" (Boolarong Press) {{ISBN|978-0-86439-076-9}}</ref> These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions. Public administrators, in contrast, need to understand community development in the context of rural and urban development, housing and economic development, and community, organizational and business development.\n\nFormal accredited programs conducted by universities, as part of degree granting institutions, are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in [[public administration]], [[sociology]] and [[community studies]]. The [[General Social Survey]] from the [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]] and the [[Saguaro Seminar]] at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]] at [[Harvard University]] are examples of national community development in the United States. The [[Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs]] at Syracuse University in New York State offers core courses in community and economic development, and in areas ranging from non-profit development to US budgeting (federal to local, community funds). In the United Kingdom, [[Oxford University]] has led in providing extensive research in the field through its '' Community Development Journal,''<ref>[http://cdj.oxfordjournals.org/ Community Development Journal], Oxford University Press</ref> used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.\n\nAt the intersection between community ''development'' and community ''building'' are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of [[Northwestern University]]. The institute makes available downloadable tools<ref>ABCD Institute, in cooperation with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. 2006. [http://www.northwestern.edu/ipr/abcd/kelloggabcd.htmll ''Discovering Community Power: A Guide to Mobilizing Local Assets and Your Organization's Capacity''].</ref> to assess community assets and make connections between [[Non-profit organization|non-profit groups]] and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by \"mobilizing neighborhood assets\"&nbsp;\u2014 building from the inside out rather than the outside in.<ref>ABCD Institute. 2006.

Scott Peck|Scott Peck]] argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules.<ref>[[M. Scott Peck]], (1987). ''The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace'', pp. 83\u201385.</ref> He states that this process goes through four stages:<ref>Peck (1987), pp. 86\u2013106.</ref>\n\n# '''Pseudocommunity''': When people first come together, they try to be \"nice\" and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics.\n# '''Chaos''': People move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their \"shadow\" selves. <!-- term not previously defined, or mentioned: This stage places great demands upon the FACILITATOR for greater leadership and organization, but Peck believes that \"organizations are not communities\", and this pressure should be resisted. -->\n# '''Emptiness''': Moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to human beings.\n# '''True community''': Deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community. <<!-- unsourced editorializing: This stage Peck believes can only be described as \"glory\" and reflects a deep yearning in every human soul for compassionate understanding from one's fellows.-->>\n\n\nIn 1991, Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world.<ref>M. Scott Peck (1991). [http://www.context.org/ICLIB/IC29/Peck.htm \"The Joy of Community\"]. An interview with M. Scott Peck by Alan Atkisson. ''In Context'' #29, p. 26.</ref>{{explain|date=October 2018}}\n\nThe three basic types of community organizing are [[grassroots]] organizing, [[coalition]] building, and \"institution-based community organizing,\" (also called \"broad-based community organizing,\" an example of which is [[faith-based community|faith-based community organizing]], or [[Congregation-based Community Organizing]]).<ref>Jacoby Brown, Michael, (2006), ''Building Powerful Community Organizations: A Personal Guide To Creating Groups That Can Solve Problems and Change the World'' (Long Haul Press)</ref>\n\nCommunity building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events (e.g., [[potluck]]s, small [[Book discussion club|book clubs]]) to larger-scale efforts (e.g., mass [[festival]]s, [[construction]] projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors). \n\nCommunity building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed \"community organizing.\"<ref name=organizing>Walls, David (1994) [http://www.sonoma.edu/users/w/wallsd/community-organizing.shtml \"Power to the People: Thirty-five Years of Community Organizing\"]. From ''The Workbook'', Summer 1994, pp. 52\u201355. Retrieved on: June 22, 2008.</ref> In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, [[boycott]]ing, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics. <<!-- unsourced examples: The [[ARISE Detroit!]] coalition and the [[Toronto Public Space Committee]] are examples of [[activism|activist networks]] committed to shielding local communities from government and corporate domination and inordinate influence.-->>\n\nCommunity organizing can focus on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and encourage [[consensus decision-making]] with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group. \n\nIf communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Rebekah Nathan suggests{{according to whom|date=October 2018}} in her book, ''My Freshman Year'', we are drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites. \n\n====Community currencies====\nSome communities have developed their own [[local exchange trading systems]] (LETS)<ref>Local Exchange Trading Systems were first developed by [[Michael Linton]], in [[Courtenay, British Columbia|Courtenay, BC]], ''see'' [http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/explore/home.html \"LETSystems \u2013 new money\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819170659/http://www.gmlets.u-net.com/explore/home.html |date=2006-08-19 }}.

In line with governmental and community thinking, volunteering and unpaid services are often preferred (e.g., altruism, beneficence) to large and continued investments in infrastructure and community services personnel, with private-public partnerships often common.\n\n[[Non-profit organizations]] from youth services, to family and neighborhood centers, recreation facilities, civic clubs, and employment, housing and poverty agencies are often the foundation of community services programs, but it may also be undertaken under the auspices of government (which funds all NGOs), one or more businesses, or by individuals or newly formed collaboratives. Community services is also the broad term given to health and the human services in local communities and was specifically used as the framework for deinstitutionalization and [[community integration]] to homes, families and local communities (e.g., community residential services).<ref>Racino, J. (2014). ''Public Administration and Disability: Community Services Administration in the US''. London and NY, NY: CRC Press.</ref>\n\nIn a broad discussion of community services, schools, hospitals, clinics, rehabilitation and criminal justice institutions also view themselves as community planners and decisionmakers together with governmental leadership (e.g., city and county offices, state-regional offices). However, while many community services are voluntary, some may be part of alternative [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] approaches in a [[justice system]] and it can be required by educational institutions as part of internships, employment training, and post-graduation plans.\n\nCommunity services may be paid for through different revenue streams which include targeted federal funds, taxpayer contributions, state and local grants and contracts, voluntary donations, Medicaid or health care funds, community development block grants, targeted education funds, and so forth. In the 2000s, the business sector began to contract with government, and also consult on government policies, and has shifted the framework of community services to the for-profit domains.\n\nHowever, by the 1990s, the call was to return to community and to go beyond community services to belonging, relationships, community building and welcoming new population groups and diversity in community life.<ref>McKnight, J.

[[Ecovillage]]]]\n\nA number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed. One such breakdown is as follows:\n\n# '''Location-based Communities''': range from the local [[neighbourhood]], [[suburb]], [[village]], [[town]] or [[city]], region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These are also called '''communities of place'''.\n# '''Identity-based Communities''': range from the local clique, sub-culture, [[ethnic group]], [[religious]], [[multiculturalism|multicultural]] or [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralistic]] [[civilisation]], or the [[globalisation|global]] community cultures of today. They may be included as ''communities of need'' or ''identity'', such as [[disability|disabled persons]], or [[Senior Citizens|frail aged]] people.\n# '''Organizationally based Communities''': range from communities organized informally around [[family]] or [[Social network|network]]-based guilds and associations to more formal [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated associations]], [[politics|political]] [[decision making]] structures, [[economics|economic]] enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale.\n\nThe usual categorizations of community relations have a number of problems:<ref>Gerhard Delanty, Community, Routledge, London, 2003.</ref> (1) they tend to give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another; (2) they tend to conflate modern and customary community relations; (3) they tend to take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given, forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities \u2014 grounded, interest-based, diasporic, etc.<ref>{{Cite book|last=James|first=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic)|title=Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In\u2014Volume 2 of Towards a Theory of Abstract Community |url=https://www.academia.edu/1642214/Globalism_Nationalism_Tribalism_Bringing_Theory_Back_In_author_Sage_Publications_London_2006|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London }}</ref>\n\nIn response to these problems, [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] and his colleagues have developed a taxonomy that maps community relations, and recognizes that actual communities can be characterized by different kinds of relations at the same time:<ref>{{Cite book|last1=James|first1=Paul|authorlink=Paul James (academic)|last2=Nadarajah|first2=Yaso|last3=Haive|first3=Karen|last4=Stead|first4=Victoria|title=Sustainable Communities, Sustainable Development: Other Paths for Papua New Guinea (pdf download)|url=https://www.academia.edu/3230875/Sustainable_Communities_Sustainable_Development_Other_Paths_for_Papua_New_Guinea_author_with_Nadarajah_Stead_and_Have_University_of_Hawaii_Press_Honolulu_2012|year=2012|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu}}</ref>\n\n# '''Grounded community relations'''. This involves enduring attachment to particular places and particular people. It is the dominant form taken by customary and [[tribal communities]]. In these kinds of communities, the land is fundamental to identity.\n# '''Life-style community relations'''. This involves giving primacy to communities coming together around particular chosen ways of life, such as morally charged or interest-based relations or just living or working in the same location. Hence the following sub-forms:\n## community-life as morally bounded, a form taken by many traditional faith-based communities.\n## community-life as interest-based, including sporting, leisure-based and business communities which come together for regular moments of engagement.\n## community-life as proximately-related, where neighbourhood or commonality of association forms a community of convenience, or a [[community of place]] (see below).\n# '''Projected community relations'''. This is where a community is self-consciously treated as an entity to be projected and re-created. It can be projected as through thin advertising slogan, for example [[gated community]], or can take the form of ongoing associations of people who seek political integration, [[communities of practice]]<ref>Etienne Wenger, Communities of Practice: Learning, Meaning and Identity, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1998.</ref> based on professional projects, associative communities which seek to enhance and support individual creativity, autonomy and mutuality. A [[nation]] is one of the largest forms of projected or [[imagined community]].\n\nIn these terms, communities can be nested and/or intersecting; one community can contain another\u2014for example a location-based community may contain a number of ethnic communities.<ref>Tropman John E., Erlich, John L. and Rothman, Jack (2006), \"Tactics and Techniques of Community Intervention\" (Wadsworth Publishing)</ref> Both lists above can used in a cross-cutting matrix in relation to each other.\n\n===Location===\n{{Details|Community of place}}\n\nPossibly the most common usage of the word ''\"community\"'' indicates a large group living in close proximity. Examples of [[local community]] include:\n* A [[municipality]] is an administrative local area generally composed of a clearly defined territory and commonly referring to a [[town]] or [[village]].\n[[File:Wakefield common.jpg|thumb|[[Wakefield, Massachusetts]] is an example of a small town which constitutes a local community.]]\n:Although large [[City|cities]] are also municipalities, they are often thought of as a collection of communities, due to their diversity.\n* A [[neighborhood]] is a geographically localized community, often within a larger [[city]] or [[suburb]].\n* A [[new town|planned community]] is one that was [[urban planning|designed]] from scratch and expanded more or less following the plan. Several of the world's [[Capital (political)|capital cities]] are planned cities, notably [[Washington, D.C.]], in the United States, [[Canberra]] in Australia, and [[Bras\u00edlia]] in Brazil. It was also common during the [[European colonization of the Americas]] to build according to a plan either on fresh ground or on the ruins of earlier [[Amerindian]] cities. Community service is a free service.\n\n===Identity===\n{{Details|Community of interest}}\n\nIn some contexts, ''\"community\"'' indicates a group of people with a common identity other than location. Members often interact regularly. Common examples in everyday usage include:\n* A \"professional community\" is a group of people with the same or related occupations. Some of those members may join a [[professional society]], making a more defined and formalized group. These are also sometimes known as [[Community of practice|communities of practice]].\n* A [[virtual community]] is a [[group (sociology)|group]] of people primarily or initially communicating or interacting with each other by means of information technologies, typically over the [[Internet]], rather than in person. These may be either communities of interest, [[Virtual Community of Practice|practice]] or communion. Research interest is evolving in the [[motivations for contributing to online communities]].\n* These communities are key to our modern day society, because we have the ability to share information with millions in a matter of seconds.\n\n===Overlaps===\n{{Details|Intentional community}}\n\nSome communities share both location and other attributes. Members choose to live near each other because of one or more common interests.\n* A [[retirement community]] is designated and at least usually designed for retirees and seniors\u2014often restricted to those over a certain age, such as 56. It differs from a [[retirement home]], which is a single building or small complex, by having a number of autonomous households.\n* An intentional community is a deliberate residential community with a much higher degree of social communication than other communities. The members of an intentional community typically hold a common social, political or spiritual vision and share responsibilities and resources. Intentional communities include [[Amish]] villages, [[ashrams]], [[cohousing]], [[commune (intentional community)|communes]], [[ecovillages]], [[housing cooperative]]s, [[kibbutzim]], and [[land trust]]s.\n\n==Special nature of human community==\nDefinitions of community as \"organisms inhabiting a common environment and interacting with one another,\"<ref>Australian Academy of Science.

The term can have different meanings in different countries: most community colleges have an \u201copen enrollment\u201d with a high school (also known as senior secondary school) completion, but usually refers to an educational institution that provides workforce education and [[college transfer]] academic programs.  Some institutions maintain athletic teams and dormitories similar to their university counterparts.\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, the term \"community college\" refers to small private businesses running short (e.g. 6 weeks) courses generally of a self-improvement or hobbyist nature. Equivalent to the American notion of community colleges are [[Technical and further education|Tertiary And Further Education colleges]] or TAFEs; these are institutions mostly regulated at state and territory level. There are also an increasing number of private providers, which  are colloquially called \"colleges\".\n\nTAFEs and other providers carry on the tradition of adult education, which was established in Australia around the mid 19th century when evening classes were held to help adults enhance their numeracy and literacy skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ace.nsw.gov.au/page.asp?PID=115&MID=1&SID=115|title=Welcome ace.nsw.gov.au - Justhost.com|author=just host|publisher=}}</ref> Most Australian universities can also be traced back to such forerunners, although obtaining a university charter has always changed their nature. In TAFEs and colleges today, courses are designed for personal development of an individual and/or for employment outcomes. Educational programs cover a variety of topics such as arts, languages, business and lifestyle, and are usually timetabled to run two, three or four days of the week, depending on the level of the course undertaken. A Certificate I may only run for 4 hours twice a week for a term of 9 weeks. A full-time Diploma course might have classes 4 days per week for a year (36 weeks). Some courses may be offered in the evenings or weekends to accommodate people working full-time. Funding for colleges may come from government grants and course fees, and many are not-for-profit organisations. There are located in metropolitan, regional and rural locations of Australia.\n\nLearning offered by TAFEs and colleges has changed over the years. By the 1980s many colleges had recognised a community need for computer training and since then thousands of people have been up-skilled through IT courses. The majority of colleges by the late 20th century had also become Registered Training Organisations, recognising the need to offer individuals a nurturing, non-traditional education venue to gain skills that would better prepare them for the workplace and potential job openings.<ref>[http://www.cca.edu.au/page/history.html cca.edu.au] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302104528/http://www.cca.edu.au/page/history.html |date=2011-03-02 }}</ref> TAFEs and colleges have not traditionally offered bachelor's degrees, instead providing pathway arrangements with universities to continue towards degrees. The American innovation of the associate degree is emerging at some institutions. [[Australian Qualifications Framework|Certificate courses I to IV]], diplomas and advanced diplomas are typically offered, the latter deemed equivalent to an undergraduate qualification, albeit typically in more vocational areas. Recently, some TAFE institutes (and private providers) have also become higher education providers in their own right and are now starting to offer bachelor's degrees programs.\n\n==Canada==\n{{main|College (Canada)}}\n\nIn [[Canada]], colleges are adult educational institutions that provide [[higher education]] and [[tertiary education]], and  grant [[Academic certificate|certificates]] and [[diploma]]s. As well, in Ontario, the 24 colleges of applied arts and technology have been mandated to offer their own stand-alone degrees as well as to offer joint degrees with universities through \"articulation agreements\" that often result in students emerging with both a diploma and a degree. Thus, for example, the University of Guelph \"twins\" with Humber College and York University does the same with Seneca College. More recently, however, colleges have been offering a variety of their own degrees, often in business and technical fields. The academic and economic value of the college degree is still being tested in the marketplace. Each province has its own educational system, as prescribed by the [[Canadian federalism]] model of governance.  In the mid-1960s and early 1970s, most Canadian colleges began to provide practical education and training for the emerging baby boom generation, and for immigrants from around the world who were entering Canada in increasing numbers at that time. A formative trend was the merging of the then separate vocational training and adult education (night school) institutions.\n\nCanadian colleges are either publicly funded or private post-secondary institutions (run for profit). There are 150 institutions that are generally equivalent to the US community college in certain contexts. They are usually referred to simply as \"[[College (Canada)|colleges]]\" since in [[Canadian English|common usage]] a degree-granting institution is almost exclusively a [[university]].\n\nIn addition to graduate degrees, universities generally grant [[Associate's degree]]s and [[Bachelor's degree]]s, but in some regions and/or courses of study, colleges and universities collaborate so college students can earn transfer credits toward undergraduate university degrees.\n\nUniversity degrees are usually attained through four years of study. The term [[Associate degree#Canada|associate degree]] is used in western Canada to refer to a two-year college arts or science degree, similar to how the term is used in the United States. In other parts of Canada the term [[academic degree|advanced degree]] is used to indicate a 3- or 4-year college program.\n\nIn the province of Quebec, three years is the norm for a university degree because a year of credit is earned in the CEGEP (college) system. Even when speaking in English, people often refer to all colleges as <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.immigration-quebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/employment/comparative-evaluation/education-system.html|website=Quebec Government|accessdate=11 June 2014|title=Immigration, Diversit\u00e9 et Inclusion Qu\u00e9bec - Working in Qu\u00e9bec}}</ref> [[CEGEP|C\u00e9geps]], however the term is an acronym more correctly applied specifically to the French-language public system: Coll\u00e8ge d'enseignement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et professionnel (CEGEP); in English: College of General and Vocational Education. The word College can also refer to a private High School in Quebec.\n\n; Canadian community college systems\n* [[List of colleges in Canada]]\n* Colleges and Institutes Canada (CICan)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collegesinstitutes.ca|title=Perioperative Nursing/LPN - Colleges and Institutes Canada|publisher=}}</ref> \u2013 publicly funded educational institutions; formerly the Association of Canadian Community Colleges (ACCC)\n* National Association of Career Colleges<ref>[http://nacc.ca National Association of Career Colleges]</ref> \u2013 privately funded educational institutions; formerly the Association of Canadian Career Colleges\n\n==India==\nIn India, 98 community colleges are recognized by the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]]. The courses offered by these colleges are diplomas, advance diplomas and certificate courses. The duration of these courses usually ranges from six months to two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/ugc-approves-98-community-colleges-across-india/1/362600.html|title=UGC approves 98 community colleges from five states|publisher=|accessdate=13 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Malaysia==\n{{main|Community college (Malaysia)}}\nCommunity colleges in Malaysia are a network of educational institutions whereby vocational and technical skills training could be provided at all levels for school leavers before they entered the workforce. The community colleges also provide an infrastructure for rural communities to gain skills training through short courses as well as providing access to a post-secondary education.\n\nAt the moment, most community colleges award qualifications up to Level 3 in the [[Malaysian Qualifications Framework]] (Certificate 3) in both the Skills sector (Sijil Kemahiran Malaysia or the Malaysian Skills Certificate) as well as the Vocational and Training sector but the number of community colleges that are starting to award Level 4 qualifications (Diploma) are increasing. This is two levels below a bachelor's degree (Level 6 in the MQF) and students within the system who intend to further their studies to that level will usually seek entry into Advanced Diploma programs in public universities, polytechnics or accredited private providers.\n\n==Philippines==\nIn the [[Philippines]], a community school functions as elementary or secondary school at daytime and towards the end of the day convert into a community college. This type of institution offers night classes under the supervision of the same principal, and the same faculty members who are given part-time college teaching load.<ref name=alcu>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/02/20/OPED2005022029090.html\n| title = The medium-term higher education development plan and the local colleges and universities\n| accessdate = 2008-08-19\n| author = Danao, Dr. Carolina P.\n| authorlink = \n| date = 2005-02-20\n| month = \n| website = \n| publisher = ''The Manila Bulletin Online''\n| pages = \n| language = \n| archiveurl = http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2005/02/20/OPED2005022029090.html\n| archivedate = 2005-02-20\n| quote =}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of community college dates back to the time of the former Minister of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS) that had under its wings the Bureaus of Elementary Education, Secondary Education, Higher Education and Vocational-Technical Education. MECS Secretary, Dr. Cecilio Putong, who in 1971 wrote that a community school is a school established in the community, by the community, and for the community itself. Dr. Pedro T. Orata of Pangasinan shared the same idea, hence the establishment of a community college, now called the City College of Urdaneta.<ref name=\"alcu\"/>\n\nA community college like the one in [[Abuyog]], [[Leyte (province)|Leyte]] can operate with only a [[Philippine peso|PHP]] 124,000 annual budget in a two-storey structure housing more than 700 students.<ref name=\"alcu\"/>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the United Kingdom, except for [[Scotland]], a community college is a school which not only provides education for the school-age population (11\u201318) of the locality, but also additional services and education to adults and other members of the community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/community-college|title=community college meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|publisher=}}</ref> This education includes but is not limited to sports, adult literacy and lifestyle education. Usually at the age of 16 when students finish their secondary school studies, they move on to a [[sixth form college]] where they study for their [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] (although some secondary schools have integrated sixth forms). After the two-year A-level period, they may then proceed to a college of further education or a university. This is also known as a technical college.\n\n==United States==\n{{main|Community colleges in the United States}}\n[[File:Joliet Junior College Sign.JPG|thumb|right|[[Joliet Junior College]] Main Campus, in [[Joliet, Illinois]], the first community college in the US]]\n[[File:6304-FullertonJrCollege-1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fullerton College]], the oldest community college (originally \"junior college\") in continuous operation in California, having been established in 1913]]\n[[File:Monroe Community College Brighton Campus Main.jpg|thumb|right|[[Monroe Community College]] main campus, in [[Rochester, New York]]]]\n\nIn the [[United States]], community colleges, sometimes called [[junior college#United States|junior college]]s, [[technical college]]s, two-year colleges, or city colleges, are primarily two-year [[public university|public]] institutions providing lower-level [[tertiary education]] also known as [[continuing education]], granting [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, and [[associate degree]]s. After graduating  from a community college, some students transfer to a four-year [[liberal arts college]] or [[university]] for two to three years to complete a [[bachelor's degree]].\n\nBefore the 1970s, community colleges in the United States were more commonly referred to as junior colleges, and that term is still used at some institutions. However, the term \"junior college\" has evolved to describe [[Privately held company|private]] two-year institutions, whereas the term \"community college\" has evolved to describe publicly funded two-year institutions. The name derives from the fact that community colleges primarily attract and accept students from the local [[community]], and are often supported by local tax revenue.\n\n==Research==\nThere are research organizations and publications which focus upon the activities of community college, [[junior college]], and [[technical college]] institutions.<ref name=\"Mellow, G.O. 2008\">Mellow, G.O. & Heelan, C.

Those dates were chosen because in 1954 the [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that [[racial segregation]] in schools was unlawful and 1968 is the year of the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.|assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King]]. The monument was created by [[Maya Lin]], who is best known for creating the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]<ref name=\"splc\"/> The Civil Rights Memorial was dedicated in 1989.<ref name=\"montadvertiser1\"/>\n\nThe concept of Lin's design is based on the soothing and healing effect of water. It was inspired by a paraphrase from King: \"...we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream....\" It is from the \"[[I Have a Dream]]\" speech, which was delivered at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], in Washington, DC, on August 28, 1963.<ref name=\"splc\"/> The passage in King's speech is a direct reference to [[Amos 5:24]], as translated in the [[American Standard Version]] of the [[Bible]]. The memorial is a [[fountain]] in the form of an asymmetric inverted stone [[cone (geometry)|cone]]. A film of water flows over the base of the cone, which contains the 41 names included. It is possible to touch the smooth film of water and to alter it temporarily, which quickly returns to smoothness. As such, the memorial represents the aspirations of the civil rights movement to end legal [[racial segregation]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n==Tours and location==\nThe memorial is in downtown Montgomery, at 400 Washington Avenue, in an open plaza in front of the Civil Rights Memorial Center, which was the offices of the Southern Poverty Law Center until it moved across the street into a new building in 2001.

The analogy of difference and differential equations was notationally changing \u0394 to D, as a \"finite\" difference becomes \"infinitesimal\".

He especially hated [[busking|street music]], and in particular the music of [[organ grinder]]s, against whom he railed in various venues.

That they were not actually completed was largely because of funding problems and clashes of personality, most notably with [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]], the Astronomer Royal.<ref name=Swade>{{cite book |last=Swade |first=Doron |authorlink=Doron Swade |title=The Cogwheel Brain |publisher=Little, Brown and Company |location=London |isbn=978-0316648479 |year=2000 |page=186 }}</ref>\n\nBabbage directed the building of some steam-powered machines that achieved some modest success, suggesting that calculations could be mechanised. For more than ten years he received government funding for his project, which amounted to \u00a317,000, but eventually the Treasury lost confidence in him.<ref name=Gleick>{{cite book |author=Gleick, J. |title=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood |publisher=Fourth Estate |location=London |year=2011 |page=104 |title-link=The Information: A History, a Theory, a Flood }}</ref>\n\nWhile Babbage's machines were mechanical and unwieldy, their basic architecture was similar to a modern computer. The data and program memory were separated, operation was instruction-based, the control unit could make conditional jumps, and the machine had a separate [[Input/output|I/O]] unit.<ref name=Gleick/>\n\n===Background on mathematical tables===\nIn Babbage's time, printed [[mathematical table]]s were calculated by [[human computer]]s; in other words, by hand. They were central to navigation, science and engineering, as well as mathematics. Mistakes were known to occur in transcription as well as calculation.<ref name=\"Th35\"/>\n\nAt Cambridge, Babbage saw the fallibility of this process, and the opportunity of adding mechanisation into its management. His own account of his path towards mechanical computation references a particular occasion:\n\n<blockquote>In 1812 he was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers [people] could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.<ref>[[B. V. Bowden]], ''Faster than Thought'', Pitman (1953), p. 8.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere was another period, seven years later, when his interest was aroused by the issues around computation of mathematical tables. The French official initiative by [[Gaspard de Prony]], and its problems of implementation, were familiar to him. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] came to a close, scientific contacts were renewed on the level of personal contact: in 1819 [[Charles Blagden]] was in Paris looking into the printing of the stalled de Prony project, and lobbying for the support of the Royal Society. In works of the 1820s and 1830s, Babbage referred in detail to de Prony's project.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|title=The History of Mathematical Tables: From Sumer to Spreadsheets|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O170gWPZ7M8C&pg=PA110|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=2 October 2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-850841-0|page=110}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Coulston Gillispie|title=Science and Polity in France: The End of the Old Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EPgIpRIvaSAC&pg=PA485|accessdate=19 April 2013|date=10 January 2009|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-2461-8|page=485}}</ref>\n\n===Difference engine===\n[[File:Babbage Difference Engine.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]]'s Difference Engine No. 2, built from Babbage's design]]\n{{main|Difference engine}}\n\nBabbage began in 1822 with what he called the difference engine, made to compute values of [[polynomial function]]s. It was created to calculate a series of values automatically. By using the method of [[finite difference]]s, it was possible to avoid the need for multiplication and division.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nFor a prototype difference engine, Babbage brought in [[Joseph Clement]] to implement the design, in 1823. Clement worked to high standards, but his [[machine tool]]s were particularly elaborate. Under the standard terms of business of the time, he could charge for their construction, and would also own them. He and Babbage fell out over costs around 1831.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=37291|title=Clement, Joseph|first=Anita|last=McConnell}}</ref>\n\nSome parts of the prototype survive in the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]].<ref>{{Cite journal | first = Denis | last = Roegel | title = Prototype Fragments from Babbage's First Difference Engine | journal=IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 31 | pages = 70\u20135 | date = April\u2013June 2009 | issue = 2 | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2009.31 | postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Although Babbage received ample funding for the project, it was never completed. He later (1847\u20131849) produced detailed drawings for an improved version,\"Difference Engine No. 2\", but did not receive funding from the British government. His design was finally constructed in 1989\u20131991, using his plans and 19th-century manufacturing tolerances.

Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.</ref> Cross-dressing has been used for purposes of [[disguise]], comfort, and self-expression in modern times and throughout history.\n\nAlmost every human society throughout history has had [[gender role|expected norms for each gender]] relating to style, color, or type of clothing they are expected to wear, and likewise most societies have had a set of [[Social aspects of clothing|guidelines, views or even laws]] defining what type of clothing is appropriate for each gender.\n\nThe term ''cross-dressing'' refers to an action or a behavior without attributing or implying any specific causes for that behavior. It is often assumed that the connotation is directly correlated with behaviors of [[transgender]] identity or [[Human sexuality|sexual]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishist]], and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] behavior, but the term itself does not imply any motives and is not synonymous to one's gender identity.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of cross-dressing}}\n{{Crossdressing}}\n[[File:Crossdressing circa 1890 Frances Benjamin Johnston (right).jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Frances Benjamin Johnston]] (right) poses with two cross-dressing friends; the \"lady\" is identified by Johnston as the illustrator Mills Thompson.]]\n[[File:Lady Bunny and Sherry Vine by David Shankbone.JPG|thumb|left|225px|[[Drag queen]]s are a form of cross-dressing as [[performance art]].]]\n\nCross-dressing has been practiced throughout much of recorded history and in many societies. There are many examples in [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]], and [[Hindu mythology]]. A reasonable number of historical figures are known to have cross-dressed to varying degrees and for a variety of reasons. There is a rich history of cross-dressing found in folklore, literature, theater, and music.  Examples include [[Kabuki]] and [[Korean shamanism#Chaesu-gut (\ucc44\uc218\uad7f)|Korean shamanism]].\n\nIt was once considered [[taboo]] in Western society for women to wear clothing traditionally associated with men, except when done in certain circumstances such as cases of necessity (as per [[St. Thomas Aquinas]]'s guidelines in ''Summa Theologiae II''), which states: \"Nevertheless this may be done sometimes without sin on account of some necessity, either in order to hide oneself from enemies, or through lack of other clothes, or for some similar motive.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Aquinas |first=Thomas |title=Summa Theologiae Part II |url=http://www.newadvent.org/summa/3169.htm |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=28 August 2012}}</ref>  Cross-dressing is cited as an abomination in the Bible in the book of [[Deuteronomy]] (22:5), which states: \"A woman must not wear men\u2019s clothing, nor a man wear women\u2019s clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this\",<ref>{{cite web |title=Deuteronomy 22:5 (NIV) |url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Deuteronomy+22:5 |accessdate=26 September 2017}}</ref> but as Aquinas noted above this principle was interpreted to be based on context. Other people in the Middle Ages occasionally disputed its applicability; for instance, the 15th-century French poet [[Martin le Franc]], wrote:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Don't you see that it was forbidden\nThat anyone should eat of an animal\nUnless it had a cleft foot\nAnd chewed its cud?\nTo eat of a hare no one dared\nNeither of sow nor of piglet,\nYet should you now be offered any,\nYou would take many a morsel.<ref> Merkle, Gertrude H. \"Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc\", ''Martin Le Franc's Commentary on Jean Gerson's Treatise on Joan of Arc'', p. 182</ref></poem></blockquote>\n \nHowever, women had to disguise themselves as men in order to participate in the wider world. For example, [[Margaret King]] cross-dressed in the early nineteenth century to attend medical school, as none would accept female students. While this prohibition remained in force in general throughout the Middle Ages and early modern era, this is no longer the case and Western women are often seen wearing trousers, ties, and men's hats. Nevertheless, many cultures around the world still prohibit women from wearing trousers or other traditionally male clothing.\n\nCross-dressing in [[Siglo de Oro|sixteenth- and seventeenth-century]] Spain was frequent among actors, and the theater was at the time the most popular form of entertainment.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Brian|title=Crossdressing, Crossculture: Conceptions and Perceptions of Crossdressing in Golden Age Madrid and Tudor-Stuart London|page=6}}</ref> There was a fascination with female cross-dressers particularly (women dressed as men), who were \"extremely popular\" in the \"[[Siglo de Oro|Golden Age]] ''[[Comedia (Spanish play)|Comedia]]''\".<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Seagraves|first1=Rosie|title=SHE AS HE: CROSS-DRESSING, THEATER, AND \"IN-BETWEENS\" IN EARLY MODERN SPAIN|date=August 2013|page=1}}</ref> Male actors might play the \"women dressed as men\" parts. Spain eventually found this cross-dressing to be threatening to social order, and passed laws targeting female [[Transvestism|transvestites]] throughout the 1600s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=Brian|title=Crossdressing, Crossculture: Conceptions and Perceptions of Crossdressing in Golden Age Madrid and Tudor-Stuart London|page=5}}</ref> Despite the negative reactions and disapproval, it continued to remain very popular in the ''comedia''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Varieties==\nThere are many different kinds of cross-dressing and many different reasons why an individual might engage in cross-dressing behavior.<ref name = \"eucwqo\">''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana</ref> Some people cross-dress as a matter of comfort or style, out of personal preference for clothing associated with the opposite sex. In this case, a person's cross-dressing may or may not be apparent to other people. Some people cross-dress to shock others or challenge [[Norm (sociology)|social norms]].\n\n'''Gender disguise''' has been used by women and girls to [[Passing (gender)|pass]] as [[male]] in society and by men and boys to pass themselves off as [[female]]. Gender disguise has also been used as a [[plot device]] in storytelling and is a recurring motif in literature, theater, and film. It is a common plot device in narrative [[ballads]].<ref name=\"child106\">{{cite book|last=Child|first=Francis James\n|title=The English and Scottish Popular Ballads|publisher=Dover Publications Inc|volume=II|pages=428\u2013432|isbn=978-0-486-43146-8}}</ref>  Historically, some women have cross-dressed to take up male-dominated or male-exclusive professions, such as military service. Conversely, some men have cross-dressed to escape from mandatory military service<ref>See the television series ''M.A.S.H.'' for an example of a cross-dresser who didn't want to serve in the military (Max Klinger). Although the character was played for laughs, his situation was based on military regulations prohibiting cross-dressing.</ref> or as a disguise to assist in political or social protest, as men did in the [[Rebecca Riots]].\n\nGender disguise has also been used by women in modern times to pass as a male soldier in [[battle reenactment]]s. In 1989,  Lauren Burgess dressed as a male soldier in a U.S. National Park service reenactment of the [[Battle of Antietam]], and was ejected after she was discovered to be a woman. Burgess sued the Park Service for sexual discrimination.<ref>{{cite news |author= |last1=Robinson |first1=Lynda |last2= |first2= |agency= |date=September 30, 1991 |title=Battle re-enactor finds herself at war with U.S. Park Service |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-09-30/news/1991273008_1_re-enactors-civil-war-burgess/2 |work=[[Baltimore Sun]] |issn=1930-8965 |oclc=244481759 |publisher=Trif Alatzas |archive-url= |archive-date= |access-date=13 August 2018 |quote= }}</ref> The case spurred spirited debate among Civil War buffs.

Cross-dressing, particularly the depiction of males wearing [[dress]]es, is often used for comic effect onstage and on-screen.\n\n[[Drag (clothing)|Drag]] is a special form of performance art based on the act of cross-dressing. A [[drag queen]] is usually a [[Sex assignment|male-assigned]] person who performs as an exaggeratedly feminine character, in heightened costuming sometimes consisting of a showy dress, high-heeled shoes, obvious make-up, and [[Wig (hair)|wig]]. A drag queen may imitate famous female film or pop-music stars. A [[faux queen]] is a female-assigned person employing the same techniques.\n\nA [[drag king]] is a counterpart of the drag queen but usually for much different audiences, and is defined as a female-assigned person who adopts a masculine persona in performance or imitates a male film or pop-music star. Some female-assigned people undergoing [[gender reassignment therapy]] also self-identify as ''drag kings'' although this use of \"drag king\" would generally be considered inaccurate.\n\n[[File:Transvestite in latex clothes.JPG|thumb|225px|A transvestic fetishist wearing latex clothes]]\nA [[transvestic fetishism|transvestic fetishist]] is a person (typically a [[heterosexual]] male) who cross-dresses as part of a [[sexual fetish]].\n\nThe term ''underdressing'' is used by male cross-dressers to describe wearing female undergarments under their male clothes. The famous low-budget film-maker [[Edward D. Wood, Jr.]] said he often wore women's underwear under his military uniform during World War II.\n\nSome people who cross-dress may endeavor to project a complete impression of belonging to another gender, including mannerisms, [[Speech communication|speech]] patterns, and emulation of [[Sex-determination system|sexual characteristics]]. This is referred to as passing or \"trying to pass\" depending how successful the person is. An observer who sees through the cross-dresser's attempt to pass is said to have ''read'' or ''clocked'' them. There are videos, books, and magazines on how a man may look more like a woman.<ref>''Transformation'' magazine; interviews for ''Rainbow Reader'', Fort Wayne, Indiana</ref>\n\n''Female masking'' is a form of cross-dressing in which men wear [[mask]]s that present them as female.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vicestyle.com/en/news/today/post/female-masking | title=Female Masking | publisher=Vice Style | author=Jamie Clifton | date=August 30, 2011 | accessdate=2012-02-07 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717035229/http://vicestyle.com/en/news/today/post/female-masking | archivedate=July 17, 2012 | df= }}</ref>\n\nSometimes either member of a heterosexual couple will cross-dress in order to arouse the other. For example, the male might wear skirts or lingerie and/or the female will wear boxers or other male clothing. (See also [[forced feminization]])\n\nOthers may choose to take a mixed approach, adopting some feminine traits and some masculine traits in their appearance. For instance, a man might wear both a [[dress]] and a [[beard]]. This is sometimes known as ''[[genderfuck]]''.  In a broader context, crossdressing may also refer to other actions undertaken to pass as a particular sex, such as [[Packing (phallus)|packing]] (accentuating the male crotch bulge) or, the opposite, [[tucking]] (concealing the male crotch bulge).<ref>Rankin, Sue, and Genny Beemyn. \"Beyond a binary: The lives of gender\u2010nonconforming youth.\" About Campus 17.4 (2012): 2-10</ref>\n\n==Clothes==\n{{Refimprove section|date=October 2014}}\nThe actual determination of cross-dressing is largely [[socially constructed]]. For example, in Western society, trousers have long been adopted for usage by women, and it is no longer regarded as cross-dressing. In cultures where men have traditionally worn [[Men's skirts|skirt-like garments]] such as the [[kilt]] or [[sarong]], these are not seen as female clothing, and wearing them is not seen as cross-dressing for men. As societies are becoming more global in nature, both men's and women's clothing are adopting styles of dress associated with other cultures.\n\n[[File:vanessatv.jpg|thumb|225px|Some male crossdressers seek a more subtle feminine image.]]\n[[Cosplaying]] may also involve cross-dressing, for some females may wish to dress as a male, and vice versa (see [[Crossplay]]). Breast binding (for females) is not uncommon and is one of the things likely needed to cosplay a male character.\n\nIn most parts of the world it remains socially disapproved for men to wear clothes traditionally associated with women. Attempts are occasionally made, e.g. by [[fashion designer]]s, to promote the acceptance of [[male skirt|skirts]] as everyday wear for men. Cross-dressers have complained that society permits women to wear pants or jeans and other masculine clothing, while condemning any man who wants to wear clothing sold for women.\n\nWhile creating a more feminine figure, male cross-dressers will often utilize different types and styles of [[breast forms]], which are silicone [[prostheses]] traditionally used by women who have undergone [[mastectomies]] to recreate the visual appearance of a breast.\n\nWhile most male cross-dressers utilize clothing associated with modern women, some are involved in subcultures that involve dressing as little girls or in [[vintage clothing]]. Some such men have written that they enjoy dressing as femininely as possible, so they wear frilly dresses with lace and ribbons, [[bridal gown]]s complete with veils, as well as multiple [[petticoat]]s, [[corset]]s, [[girdle]]s and/or [[garter belt]]s with [[nylon stockings]].\n\n==Social issues==\n[[File:A Morning Frolic, or the Transmutation of the Sexes.jpg|thumb|left|Satire on cross-dressing, around 1780 Britain]]\nCross-dressers may begin wearing clothing associated with the opposite sex in childhood, using the clothes of a sibling, parent, or friend. Some parents have said they allowed their children to cross-dress and, in many cases, the child stopped when they became older. The same pattern often continues into adulthood, where there may be confrontations with a spouse. Married cross-dressers experience considerable anxiety and guilt if their spouse objects to their behavior. Sometimes cross-dressers have periodically disposed of all their clothing, a practice called \"purging\", only to start collecting other gender's clothing again.<ref name = \"eucwqo\"/>\n\n==Analysis==\nThe historical associations of maleness with power and femaleness with submission and frivolity mean that in the present time a woman dressing in men's clothing and a man dressing in women's clothing evoke very different responses. A woman dressing in men's clothing is considered to be a more acceptable activity.\n\nAdvocacy for social change has done much to relax the constrictions of gender roles on men and women, but they are still subject to prejudice from some people.<ref>Butler, Judith, Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity, Routledge, New York, 2008</ref><ref>Halberstam, Judith, Female Masculinity, Duke University Press, Durham and London, 1998</ref><ref>Epstein, Julia, Straub, Kristina; Eds, Body Guards: The Cultural Politics of Gender Ambiguity, Routledge, London, 1991</ref> It is noticeable that as 'transgender' is becoming more socially accepted as a normal human condition, the prejudices against cross-dressing are changing quite quickly, just as the similar prejudices against homosexuals have changed rapidly in recent decades.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/chapter-2-social-acceptance/|title=A Survey of LGBT Americans - Chapter 2: Social Acceptance|date=2013-06-13|work=Pew Research Center\u2019s Social & Demographic Trends Project|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe reason it is so hard to have statistics for female-assigned cross-dressers is that the line where cross-dressing stops and cross-dressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is as well defined as ever. This is one of the many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day [[masculism|masculist]] movement.\n\nThe general culture has very mixed views about cross-dressing. A woman who wears her husband's shirt to bed is considered attractive while a man who wears his wife's nightgown to bed may be considered transgressive.  [[Marlene Dietrich]] in a tuxedo was considered very erotic; [[Jack Lemmon]] in a dress was considered ridiculous.<ref>Blechner, M. J. (2009) ''Sex Changes: Transformations in Society and Psychoanalysis.''  New York: Routledge.</ref> All this may result from an overall gender role rigidity for males; that is, because of the prevalent gender dynamic throughout the world, men frequently encounter discrimination when deviating from masculine gender norms, particularly violations of [[heteronormativity]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/scmsAdmin/media/users/lec321/Sirin_Articles/Sirin_McCriery__Mahalik_2004.pdf |title=Differential Reactions to Men and Women's Gender Role Transgressions: Perceptions of Social Status, Sexual Orientation, and Value Dissimilarity |publisher=NYU |format=PDF |accessdate=1 June 2013 }}</ref> A man's adoption of feminine clothing is often considered a going down in the gendered social order whereas a woman's adoption of what are traditionally men's clothing (at least in the English-speaking world) has less of an impact because women have been traditionally subordinate to men, unable to affect serious change through style of dress. Thus when a male cross-dresser puts on his clothes, he transforms into the quasi-female and thereby becomes an embodiment of the conflicted gender dynamic. Following the work of [[Judith Butler|Butler]], gender proceeds along through ritualized performances, but in male cross-dressing it becomes a performative \"breaking\" of the masculine and a \"subversive repetition\" of the feminine.<ref name=Butler>{{cite web|last=Butler|first=Judith|title=Performative Acts and Gender Construction: An Essay in Phenomenology and Feminist Theory|url=http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112054310/http://www.mariabuszek.com/kcai/PoMoSeminar/Readings/BtlrPerfActs.pdf|archivedate=12 January 2012|df=}}</ref>\n\nPsychoanalysts today do not regard cross-dressing by itself as a psychological problem, unless it interferes with a person's life. \"For instance,\" said Dr. Joseph Merlino, senior editor of ''Freud at 150: 21st Century Essays on a Man of Genius'', \"[suppose that]...I'm a cross-dresser and I don't want to keep it confined to my circle of friends, or my party circle, and I want to take that to my wife and I don't understand why she doesn't accept it, or I take it to my office and I don't understand why they don't accept it, then it's become a problem because it's interfering with my relationships and environment.\"<ref>Shankbone, David. \"[[n:Dr. Joseph Merlino on sexuality, insanity, Freud, fetishes and apathy#Gender identity and Heteronormativity|Interview with Dr. Joseph Merlino]]\",  ''[[Wikinews]]'' (October 5, 2007)</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|gender studies|fashion}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Androgyny]]\n* [[Autogynephilia]]\n* [[Breeches role]]\n* [[Breeching (boys)]]\n* [[Cross dressing ball]]\n* [[Cross-dressing in film and television]]\n* [[Cross-dressing in literature]]\n* [[Cross-gender acting]]\n* [[En femme]]\n* [[The Famous Flower of Serving-Men]]\n* [[Feminization (activity)|Feminization]]\n* [[Gender identity]]\n* [[Hijra (South Asia)]]\n* [[Kathoey]]\n* [[List of transgender-related topics]]\n* [[List of wartime crossdressers]]\n* ''[[Otokonoko]]'', male crossdressing in Japan\n* [[Passing (gender)]]\n* [[Sex and gender distinction]]\n* [[Drag Queen#History of Drag | History of Drag]]\n* [[Sexual orientation hypothesis]]\n* [[Transvestism]]\n* [[Travesti (theatre)]]\n* [[Tri-Ess]]\n* [[Twelfth Night]]\n* [[Two-spirit]]\n* [[Womanless wedding]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Anders, Charles.

The British government's attitude toward a tunnel changed from hostility in 1948 to acceptance and promotion in 1964. This change reflected not only a more favourable view of being part of European unity, but also the calculation that the tunnel would provide economic advantages, especially if Britain ever joined the European Economic Community. By the 1960s, British attitudes toward the tunnel also reflected a realistic reappraisal of the country's international status: after [[Suez Crisis|Suez]] everyone realized the islands were no longer a super-power.

The concept was a single-track rail tunnel with a service tunnel, but without shuttle terminals. The British government took no interest in funding the project, but [[Margaret Thatcher]], the prime minister, said she had no objection to a privately funded project. In 1981 Thatcher and [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]], the French president, agreed to establish a working group to evaluate a privately funded project. In June 1982 the Franco-British study group favoured a twin tunnel to accommodate conventional trains and a vehicle shuttle service. In April 1985 promoters were invited to submit scheme proposals. Four submissions were shortlisted:\n\n* Channel Tunnel, a rail proposal based on the 1975 scheme presented by Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M).\n* Eurobridge, a {{convert|4.5|km|abbr=on}} span [[suspension bridge]] with a roadway in an enclosed tube.\n* Euroroute, a {{convert|21|km|abbr=on}} tunnel between artificial islands approached by bridges.\n* Channel Expressway, a large diameter road tunnels with mid-channel ventilation towers.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe cross-Channel ferry industry protested under the name \"Flexilink\". In 1975 there was no campaign protesting against a fixed link, with one of the largest ferry operators (Sealink) being state-owned. Flexilink continued rousing opposition throughout 1986 and 1987.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Public opinion strongly favoured a drive-through tunnel, but ventilation issues, concerns about accident management, and fear of driver mesmerisation led to the only shortlisted rail submission, CTG/F-M, being awarded the project in January 1986.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\">Wilson pp. 14\u201321</ref> Among reasons given for the selection was that it caused least disruption to shipping in the Channel, least environmental disruption, was the best protected against terrorism, and was the most likely to attract sufficient private finance.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}}\n\n=== Arrangement ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel project relations flow chart 1.svg|thumb|A block diagram describing the organisation structure used on the project. Eurotunnel is the central organisation for construction and operation (via a concession) of the tunnel]]\n\nThe British ''Channel Tunnel Group'' consisted of two banks and five construction companies, while their French counterparts, ''France\u2013Manche'', consisted of three banks and five construction companies. The role of the banks was to advise on financing and secure loan commitments. On 2 July 1985, the groups formed Channel Tunnel Group/France\u2013Manche (CTG/F\u2013M). Their submission to the British and French governments was drawn from the 1975 project, including 11&nbsp;volumes and a substantial environmental impact statement.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/>\n\nThe design and construction was done by the ten construction companies in the CTG/F-M group. The French terminal and boring from Sangatte was undertaken by the five French construction companies in the joint venture group ''GIE Transmanche Construction''. The English Terminal and boring from Shakespeare Cliff was undertaken by the five British construction companies in the ''Translink Joint Venture''. The two partnerships were linked by [[TransManche Link]] (TML), a bi-national project organisation.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> The Ma\u00eetre d'Oeuvre was a supervisory engineering body employed by Eurotunnel under the terms of the concession that monitored project activity and reported back to the governments and banks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.10\u201311\">Kirkland pp. 10\u201311</ref>\n\nIn France, with its long tradition of infrastructure investment, the project garnered widespread approval. In April the French National Assembly gave unanimous support and, in June 1987, after a public inquiry, the Senate gave unanimous support. In Britain, select committees examined the proposal, making history by holding hearings away from Westminster, in Kent. In February 1987, the third reading of the Channel Tunnel Bill took place in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and was carried by 94&nbsp;votes to 22. The [[Channel Tunnel Act 1987|Channel Tunnel Act]] gained [[Royal assent]] and passed into law in July.<ref name=\"Wilson pp. 14\u201321\"/> Parliamentary support for the project came partly from provincial members of Parliament on the basis of promises of [[regional Eurostar]] through train services that never materialised; the promises were repeated in 1996 when the contract for construction of the [[Channel Tunnel Rail Link]] was awarded.<ref>{{cite web |title=Parliamentary note on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423162022/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snbt-00070.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[House of Commons Library]] |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe tunnel is a build-own-operate-transfer ([[BOOT]]) project with a concession.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 96/97\">Flyvbjerg et al. pp.&nbsp;96\u201397</ref> TML would design and build the tunnel, but financing was through a separate legal entity, Eurotunnel. Eurotunnel absorbed CTG/F-M and signed a construction contract with TML, but the British and French governments controlled final engineering and safety decisions, now in the hands of the [[Channel Tunnel Safety Authority]]. The British and French governments gave Eurotunnel a 55-year operating concession (from 1987; extended by 10 years to 65 years in 1993){{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=5}} to repay loans and pay dividends. A Railway Usage Agreement was signed between Eurotunnel, [[British Rail]] and [[SNCF]] guaranteeing future revenue in exchange for the railways obtaining half of the tunnel's capacity.\n\nPrivate funding for such a complex infrastructure project was of unprecedented scale.

Also visible is the segmented tunnel lining]]\n\nSurveying undertaken in the 20 years before construction confirmed earlier speculations that a tunnel could be bored through a chalk [[marl]] stratum. The chalk marl is conducive to tunnelling, with impermeability, ease of excavation and strength. The chalk marl runs along the entire length of the English side of the tunnel, but on the French side a length of {{convert|5|km|mi|0}} has variable and difficult geology. The tunnel consists of three bores: two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length with a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter service tunnel in between. The three bores are connected by cross-passages and piston relief ducts. The service tunnel was used as a pilot tunnel, boring ahead of the main tunnels to determine the conditions. English access was provided at Shakespeare Cliff, French access from a shaft at Sangatte. The French side used five [[tunnel boring machine]]s (TBMs), the English side six. The service tunnel uses Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) and Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS). Fire safety was a critical design issue.\n\nBetween the portals at Beussingue and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] the tunnel is {{convert|50.5|km|mi|0}} long, with {{convert|3.3|km|mi|0}} under land on the French side and {{convert|9.3|km|mi|0}} on the UK side, and {{convert|37.9|km|mi|0}} under sea.<ref name=\"ICE p. 95\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 95{{inconsistent|reason=The book has only 65 pages: please verify the source.}}</ref> It is the third-longest rail tunnel in the world, behind the [[Gotthard Base Tunnel]] in Switzerland and the [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, but with the longest under-sea section.<ref name=\"Daily Post 2006\">{{cite news | first = Jane | last = Gilbert | title = 'Chunnel' workers link France and Britain |work=The Daily Post (New Zealand) | publisher=APN New Zealand Ltd | date = 1 December 2006 }}</ref> The average depth is {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below the seabed.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.13\">Kirkland p. 13</ref> On the UK side, of the expected {{convert|5|e6m3|e6cuyd|lk=on}} of spoil approximately {{convert|1|e6m3|e6cuyd}} was used for fill at the terminal site, and the remainder was deposited at Lower Shakespeare Cliff behind a seawall, [[land reclamation|reclaiming]] {{convert|74|acre|ha|0}}<ref name=\"Anderson Story p xvi-xvii\"/> of land.<ref name=\"ICE p. 208\">Institute of Civil Engineers p. 208</ref> This land was then made into the [[Samphire Hoe Country Park]]. Environmental impact assessment did not identify any major risks for the project, and further studies into safety, noise, and air pollution were overall positive. However, environmental objections were raised over a high-speed link to London.<ref name=\"Flyvbjerg p. 51\">Flyvbjerg et al. p. 51</ref>\n\n=== Geology ===\n[[File:Channel Tunnel geological profile 1.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Geological profile along the tunnel as constructed. For most of its length the tunnel bores through a chalk [[marl]] stratum (layer)]]\n\nSuccessful tunnelling required a sound understanding of the topography and geology and the selection of the best rock strata through which to dig. The geology of this site generally consists of northeasterly dipping Cretaceous strata, part of the northern limb of the Wealden-Boulonnais dome. Characteristics include:\n\n* Continuous chalk on the cliffs on either side of the Channel containing no major faulting, as observed by [[Verstegan]] in 1605.\n* Four geological [[stratum|strata]], marine sediments laid down 90\u2013100&nbsp;million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally impermeable [[Gault Clay]]. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is in between the chalk marl and gault clay.\n* A {{convert|25|\u2013|30|m|adj=on}} layer of chalk marl (French: ''craie bleue'') in the lower third of the lower chalk appeared to present the best tunnelling medium. The chalk has a clay content of 30\u201340% providing impermeability to groundwater yet relatively easy excavation with strength allowing minimal support. Ideally the tunnel would be bored in the bottom {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} of the chalk marl, allowing water inflow from fractures and joints to be minimised, but above the gault clay that would increase stress on the tunnel lining and swell and soften when wet.<ref name=\"Eng Geol\">{{cite book | title = Engineering Geology of the Channel Tunnel | editor = Harris, C.S. | year = 1996 | publisher=Thomas Telford | location = London | isbn = 0-7277-2045-7 | page = 57 |display-editors=etal}}</ref>\n\nOn the English side, the stratum [[Strike and dip|dip]] is less than 5\u00b0; on the French side this increases to 20\u00b0. Jointing and faulting are present on both sides. On the English side, only minor faults of displacement less than {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} exist; on the French side, displacements of up to {{convert|15|m|ft|0}} are present owing to the Quenocs [[anticline|anticlinal]] [[fold (geology)|fold]]. The faults are of limited width, filled with calcite, pyrite and remoulded clay. The increased dip and faulting restricted the selection of route on the French side. To avoid confusion, microfossil assemblages were used to classify the chalk marl. On the French side, particularly near the coast, the chalk was harder, more brittle and more fractured than on the English side. This led to the adoption of different tunnelling techniques on the two sides.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/>\n\nThe Quaternary undersea valley Fosse Dangaered, and [[Castle Hill, Folkestone|Castle Hill]] landslip at the English portal, caused concerns. Identified by the 1964\u201365 geophysical survey, the Fosse Dangaered is an infilled valley system extending {{convert|80|m|ft|0}} below the seabed, {{convert|500|m|ft|0}} south of the tunnel route in mid-channel. A 1986 survey showed that a tributary crossed the path of the tunnel, and so the tunnel route was made as far north and deep as possible. The English terminal had to be located in the Castle Hill landslip, which consists of displaced and tipping blocks of lower chalk, glauconitic marl and gault debris. Thus the area was stabilised by buttressing and inserting drainage [[adit]]s.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\"/> The service tunnel acted as a pilot preceding the main ones, so that the geology, areas of crushed rock, and zones of high water inflow could be predicted. Exploratory probing took place in the service tunnel, in the form of extensive forward probing, vertical downward probes and sideways probing.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.21\u201350\">Kirkland pp. 21\u201350</ref>\n\n=== Surveying ===\nMarine soundings and samplings by Thom\u00e9 de Gamond were carried out during 1833\u201367, establishing the seabed depth at a maximum of {{convert|55|m}} and the continuity of geological strata (layers). Surveying continued over many years, with 166&nbsp;marine and 70&nbsp;land-deep boreholes being drilled and over 4,000-line-kilometres of marine geophysical survey completed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/> Surveys were undertaken in 1958\u20131959, 1964\u20131965, 1972\u20131974 and 1986\u20131988.\n\nThe surveying in 1958\u201359 catered for [[immersed tube]] and bridge designs as well as a bored tunnel, and thus a wide area was investigated. At this time, marine geophysics surveying for engineering projects was in its infancy, with poor positioning and resolution from seismic profiling. The 1964\u201365 surveys concentrated on a northerly route that left the English coast at Dover harbour; using 70&nbsp;boreholes, an area of deeply weathered rock with high [[permeability (earth sciences)|permeability]] was located just south of Dover harbour.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\"/>\n\nGiven the previous survey results and access constraints, a more southerly route was investigated in the 1972\u201373 survey, and the route was confirmed to be feasible. Information for the tunnelling project also came from work before the 1975 cancellation. On the French side at Sangatte, a deep shaft with [[adit]]s was made. On the English side at Shakespeare Cliff, the government allowed {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} of {{convert|4.5|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter tunnel to be driven. The actual tunnel alignment, method of excavation and support were essentially the same as the 1975 attempt. In the 1986\u201387 survey, previous findings were reinforced, and the characteristics of the gault clay and the tunnelling medium (chalk marl that made up 85% of the route) were investigated. Geophysical techniques from the oil industry were employed.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.22\u201326\">Kirkland pp. 22\u201326</ref>\n\n=== Tunnelling ===\n[[File:Eurotunnel schema (empty service).svg|thumb|Typical cross section, with the service tunnel between twin rail ones; shown linking the rail tunnels is a piston relief duct, necessary to manage pressure changes due to the movement of trains]]\n\nTunnelling was a major engineering challenge, with the only precedent being the undersea [[Seikan Tunnel]] in Japan, which opened in 1988. A serious risk with underwater tunnels is major water inflow due to the pressure from the sea above, under weak ground conditions. The tunnel also had the challenge of time: being privately funded, early financial return was paramount.\n\nThe objective was to construct two {{convert|7.6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} rail tunnels, {{convert|30|m|ft|0}} apart, {{convert|50|km|mi|0}} in length; a {{convert|4.8|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}}  service tunnel between the two main ones; pairs of {{convert|3.3|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} cross-passages linking the rail tunnels to the service one at {{convert|375|m|ft|0|adj=on}} spacing; piston relief ducts {{convert|2|m|ft|0}} in diameter connecting the rail tunnels {{convert|250|m|ft|0}} apart; two undersea crossover caverns to connect the rail tunnels,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 63\u2013128</ref> with the service tunnel always preceding the main ones by at least {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} to ascertain the ground conditions. There was plenty of experience with excavating through chalk in the mining industry, while the undersea crossover caverns were a complex engineering problem. The French one was based on the [[Mount Baker Tunnel|Mount Baker Ridge]] freeway tunnel in [[Seattle]]; the UK cavern was dug from the service tunnel ahead of the main ones, to avoid delay.\n\nPrecast segmental linings in the main TBM drives were used, but two different solutions were used. On the French side, neoprene and grout sealed bolted linings made of cast iron or high-strength reinforced concrete were used; on the English side, the main requirement was for speed so bolting of cast-iron lining segments was only carried out in areas of poor geology. In the UK rail tunnels, eight lining segments plus a key segment were used; in the French side, five segments plus a key.<ref name=\"Wilson p.38\">Wilson p. 38</ref> On the French side, a {{convert|55|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter {{convert|75|m|ft|0|adj=on}} deep grout-curtained shaft at Sangatte was used for access. On the English side, a marshalling area was {{convert|140|m|ft|0}} below the top of Shakespeare Cliff, the [[New Austrian Tunnelling method]] (NATM) was first applied in the chalk marl here. On the English side, the land tunnels were driven from Shakespeare Cliff \u2013 same place as the marine tunnels \u2013 not from Folkestone. The platform at the base of the cliff was not large enough for all of the drives and, despite environmental objections, tunnel spoil was placed behind a reinforced concrete seawall, on condition of placing the chalk in an enclosed lagoon, to avoid wide dispersal of chalk fines. Owing to limited space, the precast lining factory was on the [[Isle of Grain]] in the Thames estuary,<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> which used Scottish granite aggregate delivered by ship from the [[Foster Yeoman]] coastal super quarry at [[Glensanda]] in [[Loch Linnhe]] on the west coast of Scotland.\n\nOn the French side, owing to the greater permeability to water, earth pressure balance [[Tunnel boring machine|TBMs]] with open and closed modes were used. The TBMs were of a closed nature during the initial {{convert|5|km|mi|0}}, but then operated as open, boring through the chalk marl stratum.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> This minimised the impact to the ground, allowed high water pressures to be withstood and it also alleviated the need to grout ahead of the tunnel. The French effort required five TBMs: two main marine machines, one main land machine (the short land drives of {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} allowed one TBM to complete the first drive then reverse direction and complete the other), and two service tunnel machines. On the English side, the simpler geology allowed faster open-faced TBMs.<ref name=\"Kirkland geol pp.29\">Kirkland p. 29</ref> Six machines were used; all commenced digging from Shakespeare Cliff, three marine-bound and three for the land tunnels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.63\u2013128\"/> Towards the completion of the undersea drives, the UK TBMs were driven steeply downwards and buried clear of the tunnel. These buried TBMs were then used to provide an electrical earth. The French TBMs then completed the tunnel and were dismantled.<ref name=\"Wilson p. 44\">Wilson p. 44</ref> A {{convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on}} gauge railway was used on the English side during construction.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.117\u2013128\">Kirkland pp. 117\u2013128</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the English machines, which were given alphanumeric names, the French tunnelling machines were all named after women: Brigitte, Europa, Catherine, Virginie, Pascaline, S\u00e9verine.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://pagesperso-orange.fr/batisseurs-tunnel/3tunnels.pdf | first=Pierre-Jean | last = Pompee | title = Channel Tunnel: Tunnel's Construction | publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr | accessdate =19 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the tunnelling, one machine was on display at the side of the M20 motorway in [[Folkestone]] until [[Getlink|Eurotunnel]] sold it on eBay for \u00a339,999 to a scrap metal merchant.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurotunnel.com/build/ |title=How the Channel Tunnel was Built |publisher=Eurotunnel Le Shuttle |accessdate=23 October 2017}}</ref> Another machine (T4 \"Virginie\") still survives on the French side, adjacent to Junction 41 on the [[A16 autoroute|A16]], in the middle of the D243E3/D243E4 roundabout.

High Speed 1, the tunnel and the [[LGV Nord]] all have power provided via overhead catenary at 25&nbsp;kV&nbsp;50&nbsp;Hz. The railways on \"classic\" lines in Belgium are also electrified by overhead wires, but at 3000&nbsp;V&nbsp;DC.<ref name=\"wiki_railelectric\"/>\n\n==== Signalling ====\nA cab signalling system gives information directly to train drivers on a display. There is a [[train protection system]] that stops the train if the speed exceeds that indicated on the in-cab display.

The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100&nbsp;kg support the rails every 60&nbsp;cm and are held by 12&nbsp;mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. Ballastless track provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains.<ref name=\"bonnett782\">Bonnett 2005, p. 78</ref> The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60&nbsp;kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on {{convert|6|mm|1|abbr=on}} rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.\n\nMaintenance activities are less than projected. Initially the rails were ground on a yearly basis or after approximately 100MGT of traffic. Ride quality continues to be noticeably smooth and of low noise. Maintenance is facilitated by the existence of two tunnel junctions or crossover facilities, allowing for two-way operation in each of the six tunnel segments thereby created, and thus providing safe access for maintenance of one isolated tunnel segment at a time. The two crossovers are the largest artificial undersea caverns ever built; 150 m long, 10 m high and 18 m wide. The English crossover is {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} from Shakespeare Cliff, and the French crossover is {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} from Sangatte.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=14}}\n\n==== Ventilation, cooling and drainage ====\nThe ventilation system maintains the air pressure in the service tunnel higher than in the rail tunnels, so that in the event of a fire, smoke does not enter the service tunnel from the rail tunnels. Two cooling water pipes in each rail tunnel circulate chilled water to remove heat generated by the rail traffic. Pumping stations remove water in the tunnels from rain, seepage, and so on.{{sfn|Foreign & Commonwealth Office|1994|p=8}}\n\n=== Rolling stock ===\n[[File:TGV TMST 3011-2 - Sortie Tunnel sous la Manche \u00e0 Coquelles - Florian F\u00e8vre.JPG|thumb|Entrance to the tunnel near Coquelles, France]]\n\n==== Eurotunnel Shuttle ====\n{{Main article|Eurotunnel Shuttle|Eurotunnel Class 9}}\n\nInitially 38&nbsp;Le Shuttle locomotives were commissioned, with one at each end of a shuttle train. The shuttles have two separate halves: single and double deck. Each half has two loading/unloading wagons and 12 carrier wagons. Eurotunnel's original order was for nine tourist shuttles.\n\n[[Heavy goods vehicle]] (HGV) shuttles also have two halves, with each half containing one loading wagon, one unloading wagon and 14&nbsp;carrier wagons.

There are [[juxtaposed controls]], meaning that passports are checked before boarding first by officials belonging to departing country and then officials of the destination country. These are only placed at the main Eurostar stations: French officials operate at [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], [[Ebbsfleet International railway station|Ebbsfleet International]] and [[Ashford International railway station|Ashford International]], while British officials operate at [[Gare de Calais-Fr\u00e9thun|Calais-Fr\u00e9thun]], [[Lille-Europe]], [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels-South]] and [[Gare du Nord|Paris-Gare du Nord]].  There are security checks before boarding as well. For the shuttle road-vehicle trains, there are juxtaposed passport controls before boarding the trains.\n\nFor Eurostar trains travelling from places south of Paris, there is no passport and security check before departure, and those trains must stop in Lille at least 30 minutes to allow all passengers to be checked. No checks are done on board. There have been plans for services from [[Amsterdam]], [[Frankfurt]] and [[Cologne]] to London, but a major reason to cancel them was the need for a stop in Lille.\n\nThe reason for juxtaposed controls is a wish to prevent illegal immigration before reaching British soil, and because a check of all passengers on a train can take 30 minutes, which creates long queues if done at arrival.\n\n== Terminals ==\n{{main article|Eurotunnel Calais Terminal|Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal}}\n\n[[File:Chargement voiture Eurotunnel.jpg|thumb|Car entering a shuttle wagon at the French terminal at [[Coquelles]]]]\n\nThe terminals' sites are at [[Cheriton, Kent|Cheriton]] (near Folkestone in the United Kingdom) and [[Coquelles]] (near Calais in France). The terminals are designed to transfer vehicles from the motorway onto trains at a rate of 700&nbsp;cars and 113&nbsp;heavy vehicles per hour.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The UK site uses the [[M20 motorway]] for access. The terminals are organised with the frontier controls juxtaposed with the entry to the system to allow travellers to go onto the motorway at the destination country immediately after leaving the shuttle. The area of the UK site was severely constrained and the design was challenging.\n\nThe French layout was achieved more easily. To achieve design output, the shuttles accept cars on double-deck wagons; for flexibility, ramps were placed inside the shuttles to provide access to the top decks.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.255\u2013270\">Kirkland pp. 255\u2013270</ref> At Folkestone there are {{convert|20|km|mi|0}} of main-line track, 45&nbsp;turnouts and eight platforms. At Calais there are {{convert|30|km|mi|0}} of track and 44&nbsp;turnouts. At the terminals the shuttle trains traverse a figure eight to reduce uneven wear on the wheels.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.157\u2013174\">Kirkland pp. 157\u2013174</ref> There is a freight marshalling yard west of Cheriton at [[Dollands Moor Freight Yard]].\n\n== Regional impact ==\nA 1996 report from the [[European Commission]] predicted that [[Kent]] and [[Nord-Pas de Calais]] had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would transfer traffic from road to rail.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 220-222\">European Commission pp. 220\u2013222</ref> Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent on the development of Ashford International passenger station, without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.<ref name=\"EU reg impact 248-252\">European Commission pp. 248\u2013252</ref>\n\nThe removal of a bottleneck by means like the tunnel does not necessarily induce economic gains in all adjacent regions. The image of a region being connected to the European high-speed transport and active political response are more important for regional economic development. Some small-medium enterprises located in the immediate vicinity of the terminal have used the opportunity to re-brand the profile of their business with positive effect, such as ''The New Inn'' at [[Etchinghill, Kent|Etchinghill]] which was able to commercially exploit its unique selling point as being 'the closest pub to the Channel Tunnel'.

The Service Tunnel Transport System (STTS) allows fast access to all areas of the tunnel. The service vehicles are rubber-tyred with a buried wire guidance system. The 24 STTS vehicles are used mainly for maintenance but also for firefighting and in emergencies. \"Pods\" with different purposes, up to a payload of {{convert|2.5|\u2013|5|tonne}}, are inserted into the side of the vehicles. The vehicles cannot turn around within the tunnel, and are driven from either end. The maximum speed is {{convert|80|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}} when the steering is locked. A fleet of 15 Light Service Tunnel Vehicles (LADOGS) was introduced to supplement the STTSs. The LADOGS have a short wheelbase with a {{convert|3.4|m|abbr=on|adj=on}} turning circle, allowing two-point turns within the service tunnel. Steering cannot be locked like the STTS vehicles, and maximum speed is {{convert|50|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. Pods up to {{convert|1|tonne}} can be loaded onto the rear of the vehicles. Drivers in the tunnel sit on the right, and the vehicles drive on the left. Owing to the risk of French personnel driving on their native right side of the road, sensors in the vehicles alert the driver if the vehicle strays to the right side.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.247\u2013254\">Kirkland pp. 247\u2013254</ref>\n\nThe three tunnels contain {{convert|6000|tonne}} of air that needs to be conditioned for comfort and safety. Air is supplied from [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] buildings at Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte, with each building capable of providing 100% standby capacity. Supplementary ventilation also exists on either side of the tunnel. In the event of a fire, ventilation is used to keep smoke out of the service tunnel and move smoke in one direction in the main tunnel to give passengers clean air. The tunnel was the first main-line railway tunnel to have special cooling equipment. Heat is generated from traction equipment and drag. The design limit was set at {{convert|30|C|F|sigfig=2}}, using a mechanical cooling system with refrigeration plants on both sides that run chilled water circulating in pipes within the tunnel.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\"/>\n\nTrains travelling at high speed create piston-effect pressure changes that can affect passenger comfort, ventilation systems, tunnel doors, fans and the structure of the trains, and which drag on the trains.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.212\u2013230\">Kirkland pp. 212\u2013230</ref> Piston relief [[Duct (HVAC)|ducts]] of {{convert|2|m|ft|0|adj=on}} diameter were chosen to solve the problem, with 4&nbsp;ducts per kilometre to give close to optimum results. Unfortunately this design led to unacceptable lateral forces on the trains so a reduction in train speed was required and restrictors were installed in the ducts.<ref name=\"CT experience\">The Channel Tunnel Experience Lessons for the Future pp. 19\u201323</ref>\n\nThe safety issue of a possible fire on a passenger-vehicle shuttle garnered much attention, with Eurotunnel noting that fire was the risk attracting the most attention in a 1994 safety case for three reasons: the opposition of ferry companies to passengers being allowed to remain with their cars; [[Home Office]] statistics indicating that car fires had doubled in ten years; and the long length of the tunnel. Eurotunnel commissioned the UK Fire Research Station \u2013 now part of the [[Building Research Establishment]] \u2013 to give reports of vehicle fires, and liaised with Kent Fire Brigade to gather vehicle fire statistics over one year. Fire tests took place at the French Mines Research Establishment with a mock wagon used to investigate how cars burned.<ref name=\"Kirkland pp.231\u2013240\">Kirkland pp. 231\u2013240</ref> The wagon door systems are designed to withstand fire inside the wagon for 30&nbsp;minutes, longer than the transit time of 27&nbsp;minutes. Wagon air conditioning units help to purge dangerous fumes from inside the wagon before travel. Each wagon has a fire detection and extinguishing system, with sensing of ions or [[ultraviolet radiation]], smoke and gases that can trigger [[Haloalkane|halon]] gas to quench a fire. Since the HGV wagons are not covered, fire sensors are located on the loading wagon and in the tunnel. A {{convert|10|in|adj=on}} water main in the service tunnel provides water to the main tunnels at {{convert|125|m|ft|0|adj=on}} intervals.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7612776.stm | title = Focus turns to cause of tunnel blaze |work=BBC News   | accessdate =12 September 2008 | date = 12 September 2008 | first=Andrew | last=McFarlane}}</ref> The ventilation system can control smoke movement. Special arrival sidings accept a train that is on fire, as the train is not allowed to stop whilst on fire in the tunnel, unless continuing its journey would lead to a worse outcome.

Released in 1984, [[William Gibson]]'s influential [[debut novel]] ''[[Neuromancer]]'' would help solidify cyberpunk as a genre, drawing influence from [[punk subculture]] and early [[hacker culture]]. Other influential cyberpunk writers included [[Bruce Sterling]] and [[Rudy Rucker]]. The [[Japanese cyberpunk]] subgenre began in 1982 with the debut of [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s [[manga]] series ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'', with its [[Akira (1988 film)|1988 anime film adaptation]] later popularizing the subgenre.\n\nEarly films in the genre include [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1982 film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', one of several of Philip K.

Reacting to conventional storytelling, New Wave authors attempted to present a world where society coped with a constant upheaval of new technology and culture, generally with dystopian outcomes. Writers like [[Roger Zelazny]], [[J.G. Ballard]], [[Philip Jose Farmer]], and [[Harlan Ellison]] often examined the impact of drug culture, technology, and the sexual revolution with an avant-garde style influenced by the [[Beat Generation]] (especially [[William S. Burroughs]]' own SF), [[Dadaism]], and their own ideas.<ref>[http://comicsalliance.com/new-worlds-magazine-returns/ \u2018NEW WORLDS': ONE OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL SCI-FI MAGAZINES RETURNS THIS FALL]<br>Ballard\u2019s think-pieces on the intrusion of technology and media \u2014 \"The Atrocity Exhibition\", \"Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown\", \"The Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy Considered as a Downhill Motor Race\" (collected with others as ''The Atrocity Exhibition'' with illustrations by Phoebe Gloeckner) \u2014 paved the way for cyberpunk. Brian Aldiss practically populated his own subgenre with quirky epics like ''Acid Head War'', a messianic tale of freestyle narrative set in a post-war Europe in which hallucinogenic drugs had affected entire populations, and ''Report on Probability A'', an experimental story about the observations of three characters named G, S, and C.</ref> Ballard attacked the idea that stories should follow the \"archetypes\" popular since the time of Ancient Greece, and the assumption that these would somehow be the same ones that would call to modern readers, as [[Joseph Campbell]] argued in ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Instead, Ballard wanted to write a new myth for the modern reader, a style with \"more psycho-literary ideas, more meta-biological and meta-chemical concepts, private time systems, synthetic psychologies and space-times, more of the sombre half-worlds one glimpses in the paintings of schizophrenics.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ol5lDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT60&lpg=PT60#v=onepage&q=cyberpunk%20%22new%20wave%22 Cyberpunk, Steampunk and Wizardry: Science Fiction Since 1980] Chapter 4. The New Wave</ref>\n\nThis had a profound influence on a new generation of writers, some of whom would come to call their movement \"Cyberpunk\". One, [[Bruce Sterling]], later said:\n{{cquote|In the circle of American science fiction writers of my generation \u2014 cyberpunks and humanists and so forth \u2014 [Ballard] was a towering figure. We used to have bitter struggles over who was more Ballardian than whom. We knew we were not fit to polish the man\u2019s boots, and we were scarcely able to understand how we could get to a position to do work which he might respect or stand, but at least we were able to see the peak of achievement that he had reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballardian.com/unblinking-clinical-from-ballard-to-cyberpunk|title=Ballardian \u00bb 'Unblinking, clinical': From Ballard to cyberpunk|website=www.Ballardian.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nBallard, Zelazny, and the rest of New Wave was seen by the subsequent generation as delivering more \"realism\" to science fiction, and they attempted to build on this.\n\nSimilarly influential, and generally cited as proto-cyberpunk, is the [[Philip K. Dick]] novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep]]'', first published in 1968. Presenting precisely the general feeling of dystopian post-economic-apocalyptic future as Gibson and Sterling later deliver, it examines ethical and moral problems with cybernetic, artificial intelligence in a way more \"realist\" than the [[Isaac Asimov]] ''[[Robot series (Asimov)|Robot]]'' series that laid its philosophical foundation. This novel was made into the seminal movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', released in 1982. This was one year after another story, \"[[Johnny Mnemonic]]\" helped move proto-cyberpunk concepts into the mainstream. This story, which also became a film years later, involves another dystopian future, where human couriers deliver computer data, stored cybernetically in their own minds.\n\nIn 1983 a short story written by [[Bruce Bethke]], called ''[[Cyberpunk (novel)|Cyberpunk]]'', was published in ''[[Amazing Stories]]''. The term was picked up by [[Gardner Dozois]], editor of ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'' and popularized in his editorials. Bethke says he made two lists of words, one for technology, one for troublemakers, and experimented with combining them variously into compound words, consciously attempting to coin a term that encompassed both punk attitudes and high technology.\n\nHe described the idea thus:\n{{cquote|The kids who trashed my computer; their kids were going to be Holy Terrors, combining the ethical vacuity of teenagers with a technical fluency we adults could only guess at. Further, the parents and other adult authority figures of the early 21st Century were going to be terribly ill-equipped to deal with the first generation of teenagers who grew up truly \u201cspeaking computer.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.neondystopia.com/cyberpunk-books-fiction/the-early-life-of-the-word-cyberpunk/|title=The Early Life of the Word \"Cyberpunk\" - Neon Dystopia|date=13 November 2016|website=NeonDystopia.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>}}\n\nAfterward, Dozois began using this term in his own writing, most notably in a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article where he said \"About the closest thing here to a self-willed esthetic \u201cschool\u201d would be the purveyors of bizarre hard-edged, high-tech stuff, who have on occasion been referred to as \u201ccyberpunks\u201d \u2014 Sterling, Gibson, Shiner, Cadigan, Bear.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/entertainment/books/1984/12/30/science-fiction-in-the-eighties/526c3a06-f123-4668-9127-33e33f57e313/|title=Science Fiction in the Eighties|first=Gardner|last=Dozois|date=30 December 1984|publisher=|access-date=28 December 2017|via=www.WashingtonPost.com}}</ref>\n\nAbout that time, William Gibson's novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'' was published, delivering a glimpse of a future encompassed by what became an archetype of cyberpunk \"virtual reality\", with the human mind being fed light-based worldscapes through a computer interface. Some, perhaps ironically including Bethke himself, argued at the time that the writers whose style Gibson's books epitomized should be called \"Neuromantics\", a pun on the name of the novel plus \"[[New Romantics]]\", a term used for a New Wave pop music movement that had just occurred in Britain, but this term did not catch on. Bethke later paraphrased [[Michael Swanwick]]'s argument for the term: \"the movement writers should properly be termed neuromantics, since so much of what they were doing was clearly Imitation ''Neuromancer''\".\n\nSterling was another writer who played a central role, often consciously, in the cyberpunk genre, variously seen as keeping it on track, or distorting its natural path into a stagnant formula.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.athabascau.ca/courses/engl/491/cyberpunk_history.pdf|title=Postmodern Metanarratives: Blade Runner and Literature in the Age of Image|website=AthabascaU.ca|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In 1986 he edited a volume of cyberpunk stories called ''[[Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology]]'', an attempt to establish what cyberpunk was, from Sterling's perspective.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://speculiction.blogspot.com/2013/01/review-of-mirrorshades-cyberpunk.html|title=Speculiction...: Review of \"Mirrorshades: The Cyberpunk Anthology\" Edited by Bruce Sterling|first=|last=Jesse|date=27 January 2013|website=Speculiction.Blogspot.com|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the subsequent decade, the motifs of Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' became formulaic, climaxing in the satirical extremes of [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' in 1992.\n\nBookending the Cyberpunk era, Bethke himself published a novel in 1995 called ''[[Headcrash]]'', like ''Snow Crash'' a satirical attack on the genre's excesses. Fittingly, it won an honor named after cyberpunk's spiritual founder, the [[Philip K. Dick Award]].\n\nIt satirized the genre in this way:\n{{cquote|...full of young guys with no social lives, no sex lives and no hope of ever moving out of their mothers' basements ... They're total wankers and losers who indulge in Messianic fantasies about someday getting even with the world through almost-magical computer skills, but whose actual use of the Net amounts to dialing up the scatophilia forum and downloading a few disgusting pictures.

Elements of both the setting and storytelling have become normal in science fiction in general, and a slew of sub-genres now have -punk tacked onto their names, most obviously [[Steampunk]], but also a host of other [[Cyberpunk derivatives]].\n\n== Style and ethos ==\nPrimary figures in the cyberpunk movement include [[William Gibson]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Bruce Bethke]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Rudy Rucker]], and [[John Shirley]]. [[Philip K.

It often expresses a sense of rebellion, suggesting that one could describe it as a type of culture revolution in science fiction. In the words of author and critic [[David Brin]]:\n\n<blockquote>...a closer look [at cyberpunk authors] reveals that they nearly always portray future societies in which governments have become wimpy and pathetic ...Popular science fiction tales by Gibson, Williams, Cadigan and others ''do'' depict [[Orwellian]] accumulations of power in the next century, but nearly always clutched in the secretive hands of a wealthy or corporate [[elite]].<ref>[[David Brin|Brin, David]] ''The Transparent Society'', Basic Books, 1998 [http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/basic/book_detail.jsp?isbn=0738201448 Book link]</ref></blockquote>\n\nCyberpunk stories have also been seen as fictional forecasts of the evolution of the [[Internet]]. The earliest descriptions of a global communications network came long before the [[World Wide Web]] entered popular awareness, though not before traditional science-fiction writers such as [[Arthur C. Clarke]] and some social commentators such as [[James Burke (science historian)|James Burke]] began predicting that such networks would eventually form.<ref>[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] \"[[The Last Question]],\" ''Science Fiction Quarterly'', 1956</ref>\n\nSome observers cite that cyberpunk tends to marginalize sectors of society such as women and Africans.

William Gibson would later reveal that upon first viewing the film, he was surprised at how the look of this film matched his vision for ''[[Neuromancer]]'', a book he was then working on. The film's tone has since been the staple of many cyberpunk movies, such as ''[[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix trilogy]]'' (1999-2003), which uses a wide variety of cyberpunk elements.\n\nThe number of films in the genre or at least using a few genre elements has grown steadily since ''Blade Runner''.

In [[Japan]], where [[cosplay]] is popular and not only teenagers display such fashion styles, cyberpunk has been accepted and its influence is widespread.

The exposure to cyberpunk ideas and fiction in the 1980s has allowed it to seep into the Japanese culture.\n\nCyberpunk anime and manga draw upon a futuristic vision which has elements in common with western science fiction and therefore have received wide international acceptance outside Japan. \"The conceptualization involved in cyberpunk is more of forging ahead, looking at the new global culture.

Talsorian Games]], and ''[[GURPS Cyberpunk]]'', published by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as a module of the [[GURPS]] family of RPGs. ''Cyberpunk 2020'' was designed with the settings of William Gibson's writings in mind, and to some extent with his approval{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, unlike the approach taken by [[FASA Corporation|FASA]] in producing the transgenre ''[[Shadowrun]]'' game.

''[[Netrunner]]'' is a [[collectible card game]] introduced in 1996, based on the ''[[Cyberpunk 2020]]'' role-playing game.

Often dealing with dystopian visions of the future or biomechanical themes, some fit more squarely in the category than others. Bands whose music has been classified as cyberpunk include [[Psydoll]], [[Front Line Assembly]], [[Clock DVA]] and [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]. Some musicians not normally associated with cyberpunk have at times been inspired to create concept albums exploring such themes. Albums such as [[Gary Numan]]'s ''[[Replicas (album)|Replicas]]'', ''[[The Pleasure Principle (Gary Numan album)|The Pleasure Principle]]'' and ''[[Telekon]]'' were heavily inspired by the works of Philip K. Dick. [[Kraftwerk]]'s ''[[The Man-Machine]]'' and ''[[Computer World]]'' albums both explored the theme of humanity becoming dependent on technology. [[Nine Inch Nails]]' concept album ''[[Year Zero (album)|Year Zero]]'' also fits into this category. [[Fear Factory]] concept albums are heavily based upon future dystopia, cybernetics, clash between man and machines, virtual worlds. [[Billy Idol]]'s ''[[Cyberpunk (album)|Cyberpunk]]'' drew heavily from cyberpunk literature and the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture in its creation. ''[[1. Outside]]'', a cyberpunk narrative fueled concept album by [[David Bowie]], was warmly met by critics upon its release in 1995. Many musicians have also taken inspiration from specific cyberpunk works or authors, including [[Sonic Youth]], whose albums ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'' and ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' take influence from the works of Philip K. Dick and William Gibson respectively.\n\n[[Vaporwave]] and [[Synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] are also influenced by cyberpunk.

These include the [[cyberdelic]] counter culture of the late 1980s and early 90s. Cyberdelic, whose adherents referred to themselves as \"cyberpunks\", attempted to blend the [[Psychedelic era|psychedelic art and drug movement]] with the technology of [[cyberculture]]. Early adherents included [[Timothy Leary]], [[Mark Frauenfelder]] and [[R. U. Sirius]]. The movement largely faded following the [[dot-com bubble]] implosion of 2000.\n\n[[Cybergoth]] is a fashion and dance subculture which draws its inspiration from cyberpunk fiction, as well as [[rave]] and [[goth subculture|Gothic]] subcultures. In addition, a distinct cyberpunk fashion of its own has emerged in recent years{{When|date=January 2015}} which rejects the raver and goth influences of [[cybergoth]], and draws inspiration from urban street fashion, \"post apocalypse\", functional clothing, high tech sports wear, tactical uniform and multifunction. This fashion goes by names like \"tech wear\", \"goth ninja\" or \"tech ninja\". Important designers in this type of fashion{{According to whom|date=January 2015}} are ACRONYM, Demobaza,<ref>{{cite web|author={{name}} |url=https://www.demobaza.com/ |title=Online Store |publisher=Demobaza |date= |accessdate=2017-12-07}}</ref> [[Boris Bidjan Saberi]], [[Rick Owens]] and [[Alexander Wang (designer)|Alexander Wang]].\n\nThe [[Kowloon Walled City]] in [[Hong Kong]] (demolished in 1994) is often referenced as the model cyberpunk/dystopian slum as, given its poor living conditions at the time coupled with the city's political, physical, and economic isolation has caused many in academia to be fascinated by the ingenuity of its spawning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/a-new-look-at-kowloon-walled-city-the-internets-favorite-cyberpunk-slum|title=A New Look at Kowloon Walled City, the Internet's Favorite Cyberpunk Slum|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== Related genres ===\n{{See also|Cyberpunk derivatives}}\nAs a wider variety of writers began to work with cyberpunk concepts, new subgenres of science fiction emerged, some of which could be considered as playing off the cyberpunk label, others which could be considered as legitimate explorations into newer territory. These focused on technology and its social effects in different ways. One prominent subgenre is \"[[steampunk]],\" which is set in an [[alternate history]] [[Victorian era]] that combines anachronistic technology with cyberpunk's bleak [[film noir]] world view. The term was originally coined around 1987 as a joke to describe some of the novels of [[Tim Powers]], [[James P. Blaylock]], and [[K.W. Jeter]], but by the time Gibson and Sterling entered the subgenre with their [[collaborative fiction|collaborative novel]] ''[[The Difference Engine]]'' the term was being used earnestly as well.<ref>Michael Berry, \"Wacko Victorian Fantasy Follows 'Cyberpunk' Mold,\" ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 25 June 1987; quoted online by [http://www.wordspy.com/words/steampunk.asp Wordspy].</ref>\n\nAnother subgenre is \"[[biopunk]]\" (cyberpunk themes dominated by [[biotechnology]]) from the early 1990s, a derivative style building on biotechnology rather than informational technology. In these stories, people are changed in some way not by mechanical means, but by [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]]. [[Paul Di Filippo]] is seen as the most prominent biopunk writer, including his half-serious [[ribofunk]]. [[Bruce Sterling]]'s [[Shaper/Mechanist]] cycle is also seen as a major influence. In addition, some people consider works such as [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]'' to be [[postcyberpunk]].\n\nCyberpunk works have been described as well-situated within [[postmodern literature]].<ref>McHale, Brian (1991). \"POSTcyberMODERNpunkISM.\" in [[Larry McCaffery]], ed., ''[[Storming the Reality Studio|Storming the Reality Studio: A Casebook of Cyberpunk and Postmodern Science Fiction]]''.

Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in [[newspaper]]s and [[magazine]]s, with horizontal [[daily strip|strips]] printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in [[Sunday comics|special color comics sections]]. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as [[webcomics]]. There were more than 200 different comic strips and daily [[cartoon]] panels in South Korea alone each day for most of the 20th century, for a total of at least 7,300,000 episodes.<ref>[http://specialcollections.lib.msu.edu/html/materials/collections/comicart_coll.jsp Comic Art Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212185537/http://specialcollections.lib.msu.edu/html/materials/collections/comicart_coll.jsp |date=2010-02-12 }} at [[Michigan State University Libraries]]</ref>\n\nStrips are written and drawn by a [[comics artist]] or [[cartoonist]]. As the name implies, comic strips can be humorous (for example, \"[[gag-a-day]]\" strips such as ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]'', ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', ''[[Marmaduke]]'', and ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]'').\n \nStarting in the late 1920s, comic strips expanded from their mirthful origins to feature adventure stories, as seen in ''[[Popeye]]'', ''[[Captain Easy]]'', ''[[Buck Rogers]]'', ''[[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''. Soap-opera continuity strips such as ''[[Judge Parker]]'' and ''[[Mary Worth]]'' gained popularity in the 1940s. All are called, generically, comic strips, though cartoonist [[Will Eisner]] has suggested that \"sequential art\" would be a better genre-neutral name.{{sfn|Eisner|2008|pp=xi\u2013xii}}\n\nIn the [[History of the British comic|UK]] and the rest of [[Europe]], comic strips are also serialized in comic [[book]] magazines, with a strip's story sometimes continuing over three pages or more. Comic strips have appeared in American magazines such as ''[[Liberty (1924\u20131950)|Liberty]]'' and ''[[Boys' Life]]'' and also on the front covers of magazines, such as the ''Flossy Frills'' series on ''[[The American Weekly]]'' [[Sunday magazine|Sunday newspaper supplement]].\n\n==History==\n[[Storytelling]] using a sequence of pictures has existed through history. One medieval European example in textile form is the [[Bayeux Tapestry]]. Printed examples emerged in 19th-century Germany and in 18th-century England, where some of the first [[satirical]] or humorous [[Sequential art|sequential narrative]] drawings were produced. [[William Hogarth]]'s 18th century English cartoons include both narrative sequences, such as ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', and single panels.\n\nThe ''[[Biblia pauperum]]'' (\"Paupers' Bible\"), a tradition of picture [[Bible]]s beginning in the later [[Middle Ages]], sometimes depicted Biblical events with words spoken by the figures in the [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] written on scrolls coming out of their mouths\u2014which makes them to some extent ancestors of the modern cartoon strips.\n\nIn China, with its traditions of [[block printing]] and of the incorporation of text with image, experiments with what became ''[[lianhuanhua]]'' date back to 1884.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.nico-wong.over-blog.net/article-15817717.html\n| title = histoire de la bande dessin\u00e9e chinoise, les lianhuanhua (1)\n| date = 2008-01-20\n| language = French\n|trans-title=History of Chinese comics: lianhuanhua\n| accessdate = 2010-01-10\n| quote = [...] le quotidien Shenbao (\u7533\u62a5) publie d\u00e8s 1884 un suppl\u00e9ment intitul\u00e9 Magazine dla vie quotidienne, les m\u0153urs et les coutumes en Chine \u00e0 une \u00e9poque o\u00f9 les photographies sont encore rares.

So this allowed the newspaper to enhance its readability by illustrating contemporary events at home and abroad, or by depicting daily life and behavior and customs in China at a time when photographs still remained uncommon.]\n}}\n</ref>\n\n==Newspapers==\nThe first newspaper comic strips appeared in North America in the late 19th century.<ref name=\"Robinson\">{{cite book | last=Robinson | first=Jerry | authorlink=Jerry Robinson | title=The Comics: An Illustrated History of Comic Strip Art | year=1974 | publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]}}</ref> ''[[The Yellow Kid]]'' is usually credited as one of the first newspaper strips. However, the art form combining words and pictures developed gradually and there are many examples which led up to the comic strip.\n\n[[Swiss people|Swiss]] author and caricature artist [[Rodolphe T\u00f6pffer]] (Geneva, 1799\u20131846) is considered the father of the modern comic strips. His illustrated stories such as ''[[Histoire de M. Vieux Bois]]'' (1827), first published in the USA in 1842 as ''The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck'' or ''Histoire de Monsieur Jabot'' (1831), inspired subsequent generations of German and American comic artists. In 1865, [[Germany|German]] painter, author, and caricaturist [[Wilhelm Busch]] created the strip ''[[Max and Moritz]]'', about two trouble-making boys, which had a direct influence on the American comic strip. ''Max and Moritz'' was a series of severely moralistic tales in the vein of German children's stories such as ''[[Struwwelpeter]]'' (\"Shockheaded Peter\"); in one, the boys, after perpetrating some mischief, are tossed into a sack of grain, run through a mill, and consumed by a flock of geese. ''Max and Moritz'' provided an inspiration for German immigrant [[Rudolph Dirks]], who created the ''[[Katzenjammer Kids]]'' in 1897. Familiar comic-strip iconography such as stars for pain, sawing logs for snoring, speech balloons, and thought balloons originated in Dirks' strip.<ref name=toon/>\n\nHugely popular, ''Katzenjammer Kids'' occasioned one of the first comic-strip copyright ownership suits in the history of the medium. When Dirks left [[William Randolph Hearst]] for the promise of a better salary under [[Joseph Pulitzer]], it was an unusual move, since cartoonists regularly deserted Pulitzer for Hearst. In a highly unusual court decision, Hearst retained the rights to the name \"Katzenjammer Kids\", while creator Dirks retained the rights to the characters. Hearst promptly hired [[Harold Knerr]] to draw his own version of the strip. Dirks renamed his version ''Hans and Fritz'' (later, ''The Captain and the Kids''). Thus, two versions distributed by rival syndicates graced the [[comics page]]s for decades. Dirks' version, eventually distributed by [[United Feature Syndicate]], ran until 1979.\n\nIn the United States, the great popularity of [[comics]] sprang from the [[Yellow journalism#Origins: Pulitzer vs. Hearst|newspaper war (1887 onwards) between Pulitzer and Hearst]]. ''[[The Little Bears]]'' (1893\u201396) was the first [[United States|American]] comic strip with recurring characters, while the first color comic supplement was published by the ''Chicago Inter-Ocean'' sometime in the latter half of 1892, followed by the ''[[New York Journal American|New York Journal]]'''s first color Sunday comic pages in 1897. On January 31, 1912, Hearst introduced the nation's first full daily comic page in his ''[[New York Journal American|New York Evening Journal]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Smithsonian collection of newspaper comics|year=1977|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|isbn=0-87474-172-6|page=15|author=Bill Blackbeard|author2=Martin T.

Some newspaper strips begin or remain exclusive to one newspaper. For example, the ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' comic strip by [[Walt Kelly]] originally appeared only in the ''[[PM (newspaper)|New York Star]]'' in 1948 and was not picked up for syndication until the following year.<ref>{{cite book | title=Complete Pogo, Volume 1 | contribution=Introduction | last=Kelly | first=Walt | authorlink=Walt Kelly | others=R.

In the United States, a daily strip appears in newspapers on weekdays, Monday through Saturday, as contrasted with a Sunday strip, which typically only appears on Sundays. Daily strips usually are printed in black and white, and Sunday strips are usually in color. However, a few newspapers have published daily strips in color, and some newspapers have published Sunday strips in black and white.\n\n== Popularity ==\nThe popularity and accessibility of strips meant they were often clipped and saved; authors including [[John Updike]] and [[Ray Bradbury]] have written about their childhood collections of clipped strips. Often posted on [[bulletin board]]s, clipped strips had an ancillary form of distribution when they were faxed, photocopied or mailed. The ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'''s Linda White recalled, \"I followed the adventures of ''[[Winnie Winkle]]'', ''[[Moon Mullins]]'' and ''[[Dondi]]'', and waited each fall to see how [[Lucy van Pelt|Lucy]] would manage to trick [[Charlie Brown]] into trying to kick that football.

The strips are usually displayed horizontally, wider than they are tall. Single panels are square, circular or taller than they are wide. Strips usually, but not always, are broken up into several smaller panels with continuity from panel to panel. A horizontal strip can also be used for a single panel with a single gag, as seen occasionally in [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]]' ''[[Mother Goose and Grimm]]''.\n\nEarly daily strips were large, often running the entire width of the newspaper, and were sometimes three or more inches high.<ref name=archive>[http://www.newspaperarchive.com Newspaper Archive]</ref> Initially, a newspaper page included only a single daily strip, usually either at the top or the bottom of the page. By the 1920s, many newspapers had a comics page on which many strips were collected together. During the 1930s, the original art for a daily strip could be drawn as large as 25&nbsp;inches wide by six inches high.<ref>[http://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/5761968 Live Auctioneers, ''Etta Kett'', January 2, 1933.]</ref> Over decades, the size of daily strips became smaller and smaller, until by 2000, four standard daily strips could fit in an area once occupied by a single daily strip.<ref name=archive/> As strips have become smaller, the number of panels have been reduced.\n\nProof sheets were the means by which syndicates provided newspapers with black-and-white line art for the reproduction of strips (which they arranged to have colored in the case of Sunday strips). [[Michigan State University Libraries#Comic Art Collection|Michigan State University Comic Art Collection]] librarian Randy Scott describes these as \"large sheets of paper on which newspaper comics have traditionally been distributed to subscribing newspapers. Typically each sheet will have either six daily strips of a given title or one Sunday strip. Thus, a week of ''[[Beetle Bailey]]'' would arrive at the ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'' in two sheets, printed much larger than the final version and ready to be cut apart and fitted into the local comics page.\"<ref>Scott, Randy. \"The King Features Proof Sheet Collection\". ''Insight''. Fall 2009. p. 3.</ref> Comic strip historian [[Allan Holtz]] described how strips were provided as [[Matrix (printing)|mats]] (the plastic or cardboard trays in which molten metal is poured to make plates) or even plates ready to be put directly on the printing press.

[[Jimmy Hatlo]]'s ''[[They'll Do It Every Time]]'' was often displayed in a two-panel format with the first panel showing some deceptive, pretentious, unwitting or scheming human behavior and the second panel revealing the truth of the situation.<ref name=toon/>\n\n==Sunday comics==\n{{Main|Sunday comics}}\n[[File:Squirrelcage1337.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.85|[[Gene Ahern]]'s ''The Squirrel Cage'' (January 3, 1937), an example of a [[topper (comic strip)|topper]] strip which is better remembered than the strip it accompanied, Ahern's ''[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board]]''.]]\n[[File:Newadvflossy12641.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|Russell Patterson and Carolyn Wells' ''New Adventures of Flossy Frills'' (January 26, 1941), an example of comic strips on [[Sunday magazine]]s.]]\nSunday newspapers traditionally included a special color section. Early Sunday strips (known colloquially as \"the funny papers\", shortened to \"the funnies\"), such as ''[[Thimble Theatre]]'' and ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', filled an entire newspaper page, a format known to collectors as [[comic strip formats|full page]]. Sunday pages during the 1930s and into the 1940s often carried a secondary strip by the same artist as the main strip. No matter whether it appeared above or below a main strip, the extra strip was known as the [[topper (comic strip)|topper]], such as ''The Squirrel Cage'' which ran along with ''[[Room and Board (comic strip)|Room and Board]]'', both drawn by [[Gene Ahern]].\n\nDuring the 1930s, the original art for a Sunday strip was usually drawn quite large. For example, in 1930, [[Russ Westover]] drew his ''[[Tillie the Toiler]]'' Sunday page at a size of 17\" \u00d7 37\".<ref>[http://comicstripfan.com/newspaper/t/tilliethetoiler.htm ComicStripFan]</ref> In 1937, the cartoonist [[Dudley Fisher]] launched the innovative ''[[Right Around Home]]'', drawn as a huge single panel filling an entire Sunday page.\n\nFull-page strips were eventually replaced by strips half that size. Strips such as ''[[The Phantom]]'' and ''[[Terry and the Pirates (comic strip)|Terry and the Pirates]]'' began appearing in a format of two strips to a page in full-size newspapers, such as the ''[[New Orleans Times Picayune]]'', or with one strip on a tabloid page, as in the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. When Sunday strips began to appear in more than one format, it became necessary for the cartoonist to allow for rearranged, cropped or dropped panels. During [[World War II]], because of paper shortages, the size of Sunday strips began to shrink. After the war, strips continued to get smaller and smaller because of increased paper and printing costs. The last full-page comic strip was the ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' strip for 11 April 1971.\n\nComic strips have also been published in Sunday newspaper magazines. [[Russell Patterson]] and Carolyn Wells' ''New Adventures of Flossy Frills'' was a continuing strip series seen on Sunday magazine covers. Beginning January 26, 1941, it ran on the front covers of Hearst's ''[[The American Weekly|American Weekly]]'' newspaper magazine supplement, continuing until March 30 of that year. Between 1939 and 1943, four different stories featuring Flossy appeared on ''American Weekly'' covers.\n\nSunday comics sections employed offset color printing with multiple print runs imitating a wide range of colors. Printing plates were created with four or more colors\u2014traditionally, the [[CMYK color model]]: cyan, magenta, yellow and \"K\" for black. With a screen of tiny dots on each printing plate, the dots allowed an image to be printed in a [[halftone]] that appears to the eye in different gradations. The semi-opaque property of [[ink]] allows halftone dots of different colors to create an optical effect of full-color imagery.<ref name=\"campbell\">Campbell, Alastair. ''The Designer's Lexicon''.

''[[Zippy the Pinhead]]'' initially appeared in underground publications in the 1970s before being syndicated.<ref>{{cite book | last=Estren | first=Mark James | title=A History of Underground Comics | year=1993 | publisher=[[Ronin Publishing]] | isbn=0-914171-64-X | page=8 | chapter=Foreword: Onward!}}</ref> ''[[Bloom County]]'' and ''[[Doonesbury]]'' began as strips in college newspapers under different titles, and later moved to national syndication. [[underground comix|Underground comic strips]] covered subjects that are usually taboo in newspaper strips, such as sex and drugs. Many underground artists, notably [[Vaughn Bode]], [[Dan O'Neill]], [[Gilbert Shelton]], and [[Art Spiegelman]] went on to draw comic strips for magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'', ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'', and Pete Millar's ''[[CARtoons Magazine|CARtoons]]''. [[Jay Lynch]] graduated from undergrounds to alternative weekly newspapers to ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' and children's books.\n\n==Webcomics==\n{{Main|Webcomic}}\n''Webcomics'', also known as ''online comics'' and ''internet comics'', are [[comics]] that are available to read on the [[World Wide Web|Internet]]. Many are exclusively [[publishing|published]] [[online]], but the majority of traditional newspaper comic strips have some Internet presence. [[King Features|King Features Syndicate]] and other syndicates often provide archives of recent strips on their websites. Some, such as [[Scott Adams]], creator of ''[[Dilbert]]'', include an email address in each strip.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carminegallo/2013/10/23/dilbert-creator-scott-adams-reveals-the-simple-formula-that-will-double-your-odds-of-success/|title=Dilbert Creator Scott Adams Reveals The Simple Formula That Will Double Your Odds Of Success|last=Gallo|first=Carmine|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\n==Conventions and genres==\n{{Example farm|section|date=December 2014}}\nMost comic strip characters do not age throughout the strip's life, but in some strips, like [[Lynn Johnston]]'s award-winning ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', the characters age as the years pass. The first strip to feature aging characters was ''[[Gasoline Alley]]''.\n\nThe history of comic strips also includes series that are not humorous, but tell an ongoing [[drama]]tic story. Examples include ''[[The Phantom]]'', ''[[Prince Valiant]]'', ''[[Dick Tracy]]'', ''[[Mary Worth (comic)|Mary Worth]]'', ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'', ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'', ''[[Flash Gordon]]'', and ''[[Tarzan (comics)|Tarzan]]''. Sometimes these are spin-offs from [[comic book]]s, for example ''[[Superman (comic strip)|Superman]]'', ''[[Batman (comic strip)|Batman]]'', and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (comic strip)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]''.\n\nA number of strips have featured animals ('[[funny animals]]') as main characters. Some are non-verbal (''[[Marmaduke]]'', ''[[The Angriest Dog in the World]]''), some have verbal thoughts but are not understood by humans, (''[[Garfield]]'', [[Snoopy]] in ''[[Peanuts]]''), and some can converse with humans (''[[Bloom County]]'', ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'', ''[[Mutts]]'', ''[[Citizen Dog (comic)|Citizen Dog]]'', ''[[Buckles]]'', ''[[Get Fuzzy]]'', ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', and ''[[Pooch Cafe]]''). Other strips are centered entirely on animals, as in ''Pogo'' and ''[[Donald Duck]]''. [[Gary Larson]]'s ''[[The Far Side]]'' was unusual, as there were no central characters. Instead ''The Far Side'' used a wide variety of characters including humans, monsters, [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], chickens, cows, [[worm]]s, [[amoeba (genus)|amoeba]]s, and more.  John McPherson's ''[[Close to Home (comic strip)|Close to Home]]'' also uses this theme, though the characters are mostly restricted to humans and real-life situations.  [[Wiley Miller]] not only mixes human, animal, and fantasy characters, but also does several different comic strip continuities under one umbrella title, ''[[Non Sequitur (comic strip)|Non Sequitur]]''.  [[Bob Thaves]]'s ''[[Frank and Ernest (comic strip)|Frank & Ernest]]'' began in 1972 and paved the way for some of these strips, as its human characters were manifest in diverse forms \u2014 as animals, vegetables, and minerals.<ref name=toon/>\n\n==Social and political influence==\n\nThe comics have long held a distorted mirror to contemporary society, and almost from the beginning have been used for political or social commentary. This ranged from the conservative slant of ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]'' to the unabashed [[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]] of ''[[Doonesbury]]''. ''Pogo'' used animals to particularly devastating effect, caricaturing many prominent politicians of the day as animal denizens of Pogo's Okeefenokee Swamp. In a fearless move, Pogo's creator Walt Kelly took on [[Joseph McCarthy]] in the 1950s, caricaturing him as a bobcat named Simple J. Malarkey, a megalomaniac who was bent on taking over the characters' birdwatching club and rooting out all undesirables. Kelly also defended the medium against possible government regulation in the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy era]]. At a time when comic books were coming under fire for supposed sexual, violent, and subversive content, Kelly feared the same would happen to comic strips. Going before the Congressional subcommittee, he proceeded to charm the members with his drawings and the force of his personality. The comic strip was safe for satire.\n\nDuring the early 20th century, comic strips were widely associated with publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], whose papers had the largest circulation of strips in the United States. Hearst was notorious for his practice of [[yellow journalism]], and he was frowned on by readers of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other newspapers which featured few or no comic strips. Hearst's critics often assumed that all the strips in his papers were fronts for his own political and social views. Hearst did occasionally work with or pitch ideas to cartoonists, most notably his continued support of [[George Herriman]]'s ''[[Krazy Kat]]''. An inspiration for [[Bill Watterson]] and other cartoonists, ''Krazy Kat'' gained a considerable following among intellectuals during the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nSome comic strips, such as ''Doonesbury'' and ''[[The Boondocks (comic strip)|The Boondocks]]'', may be printed on the [[editorial page|editorial]] or [[op-ed page]] rather than the comics page because of their regular political commentary. For example, the August 12, 1974 ''[[Doonesbury]]'' strip was awarded a [[1975 Pulitzer Prize]] for its depiction of the [[Watergate scandal]]. ''[[Dilbert]]'' is sometimes found in the business section of a newspaper instead of the comics page because of the strip's commentary about [[office politics]], and [[Tank McNamara]] often appears on the sports page because of its subject matter. [[Lynn Johnston]]'s ''[[For Better or for Worse]]'' created an uproar when one of its supporting characters came out of the closet and announced he was gay.<ref>[http://cartoonician.com/the-lynn-johnston-interview/ \"The Lynn Johnston Interview,\" ''Hogan's Alley'' #1, 1994]</ref>\n\n==Publicity and recognition==\nThe world's longest comic strip is {{convert|88.9|m|ft|adj=on}} long and on display at [[Trafalgar Square]] as part of the London Comedy Festival.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3028929.stm|title=Cartoonists make record strip|last=|first=|date=2003|work=BBC News|access-date=January 23, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123224643/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/3028929.stm|archive-date=January 23, 2018|dead-url=yes}}</ref> The London Cartoon Strip was created by 15 of [[United Kingdom|Britain's]] best known cartoonists and depicts the history of London.\n\nThe [[Reuben Award|Reuben]], named for cartoonist [[Rube Goldberg]], is the most prestigious award for U.S. comic strip artists. Reuben awards are presented annually by the [[National Cartoonists Society]] (NCS).\n\nToday's strip artists, with the help of the NCS, enthusiastically promote the medium, which is considered to be in decline due to fewer markets (today few strips are published in newspapers outside the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Canada]], mainly because of the smaller interest there, with translated versions of popular strips - particularly in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] - are primarily read over the internet) and ever-shrinking newspaper space. One particularly humorous example of such promotional efforts is the [[Comic strip switcheroo|Great Comic Strip Switcheroonie]], held in 1997 on April Fool's Day, an event in which dozens of prominent artists took over each other's strips. ''Garfield''\u2019s Jim Davis, for example, switched with ''[[Blondie (comic strip)|Blondie]]''\u2019s Stan Drake, while Scott Adams (''Dilbert'') traded strips with Bil Keane (''[[The Family Circus]]''). Even the United States Postal Service got into the act, issuing a series of commemorative stamps marking the comic-strip centennial in 1996.\n\nWhile the Switcheroonie was a one-time publicity stunt, for one artist to take over a feature from its originator is an old tradition in newspaper cartooning (as it is in the comic book industry). In fact, the practice has made possible the longevity of the genre's more popular strips. Examples include ''Little Orphan Annie'' (drawn and plotted by Harold Gray from 1924 to 1944 and thereafter by a succession of artists including [[Leonard Starr]] and [[Andrew Pepoy]]), and ''Terry and The Pirates'', started by Milton Caniff in 1934 and picked up by [[George Wunder]].\n\nA business-driven variation has sometimes led to the same feature continuing under a different name. In one case, in the early 1940s, [[Don Flowers]]' ''Modest Maidens'' was so admired by William Randolph Hearst that he lured Flowers away from the Associated Press and to King Features Syndicate by doubling the cartoonist's salary, and renamed the feature ''Glamor Girls'' to avoid legal action by the AP. The latter continued to publish ''Modest Maidens'', drawn by Jay Allen in Flowers' style.<ref name=toon/>\n\n==Issues in U.S. newspaper comic strips==\n[[Future of newspapers|As newspapers have declined]], the changes have affected comic strips.  Jeff Reece, lifestyle editor of ''[[The Florida Times-Union]]'', wrote, \"Comics are sort of the '[[Third rail (metaphor)|third rail]]' of the newspaper.\"<ref name=\"eandp\">{{cite web | url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003973207 | title=Comics-Page Changes Can Come at a Price | publisher=[[Editor & Publisher]] | date=May 14, 2009 | first=Shawn | last=Moynihan | accessdate=2009-05-15 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516174406/http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003973207 | archivedate=May 16, 2009 | df= }}</ref>\n\n===Size===\nIn the early decades of the 20th century, all [[Sunday comic]]s received a full page, and daily strips were generally the width of the page. The competition between papers for having more cartoons than the rest from the mid-1920s, the growth of large-scale newspaper advertising during most of the thirties, paper [[rationing]] during [[World War II]], the decline on news readership (as television newscasts began to be more common) and [[inflation]] (which has caused higher printing costs) beginning during the fifties and sixties led to Sunday strips being published on smaller and more diverse formats. Daily strips have suffered as well, in 1910 the strips had an unlimited amount of panels, covering the entire width page, while by 1930 most \"dailies\" had four or five panels covering six of the eight columns occupied by a traditional broadsheet paper, by 1958 those four panels would be narrower, and those would have half of the space a 1910 daily strip had, and by 1998 most strips would have three panels only (with a few exceptions), or even two or one on an occasional basis, apart from strips being smaller, as most papers became slightly narrower. While most cartoonist decided to follow the tide, some cartoonists have complained about this, with ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'' ending in 1975 as a form of protest from its creators against the practice. Since then ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' creator [[Bill Watterson]] has written extensively on the issue, arguing that size reduction and dropped panels reduce both the potential and freedom of a cartoonist. After a lengthy battle with his syndicator, Watterson won the privilege of making half page-sized Sunday strips where he could arrange the panels any way he liked. Many newspaper publishers and a few cartoonists objected to this, and some papers continued to print ''Calvin and Hobbes'' at small sizes. [[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]] won that same privilege years after ''Calvin and Hobbes'' ended, while [[Wiley Miller]] circumvented further downsizings by making his ''[[Non Sequitur (comic strip)|Non Sequitur]]'' Sunday strip available only in an extremely vertical (near-page-long) arrangement. Few newspapers still run half-page strips, as with ''[[Prince Valiant]]'' and ''[[H\u00e4gar the Horrible]]'' in the front page of the ''[[Reading Eagle]]'' Sunday comics section. Actually [[Universal Uclick]] and [[United Media]] practically have no half-page comics, with the remaining strips from both syndicates in this format are published only as \"thirds\", \"fourths\", and \"sixths\" (also called \"third tabs\").\n\n===Format===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Stripslatimes42259.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.35|A typical 1950s layout of [[daily strip|daily newspaper comic strips]] is seen in this page from the ''Los Angeles Times'' (April 22, 1959). To see such full size, go to [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/2009/04/matt-weinstock-april-22-1959.html The Daily Mirror].]] -->\nIn an issue related to size limitations, Sunday comics are often bound to rigid [[Comic strip formats|formats]] that allow their panels to be rearranged in several different ways while remaining readable. Such formats usually include throwaway panels at the beginning, which some newspapers will omit for space. As a result, cartoonists have less incentive to put great efforts into these panels. ''[[Garfield]]'' and ''[[Mutts (comic strip)|Mutts]]'' were known during the mid-to-late 80s and 1990s respectively for their throwaways on their Sunday strips, however both strips now run \"generic\" title panels.\n\nWith the success of ''[[The Gumps]]'' during the 1920s, it became commonplace for strips (comedy- and adventure-laden alike) to have lengthy stories spanning weeks or months. The \"Monarch of Medioka\" story in [[Floyd Gottfredson]]'s ''[[Mickey Mouse]]'' comic strip ran from September 8, 1937 to May 2, 1938. Between the 1960s and the late 1980s, as [[television news]] relegated newspaper reading to an occasional basis rather than daily, syndicators were abandoning long stories and urging cartoonists to switch to simple daily gags, or week-long \"storylines\" (with six consecutive (mostly unrelated) strips following a same subject), with longer storylines being used mainly on adventure-based and dramatic strips. Strips begun during the mid-1980s or after (such as  ''[[Get Fuzzy]]'', ''[[Over the Hedge]]'', ''[[Monty (comic strip)|Monty]]'', and others) are known for their heavy use of storylines, lasting between one and three weeks in most cases.\n\nThe writing style of comic strips changed as well after World War II. With an increase in the number of college-educated readers, there was a shift away from slapstick comedy and towards more cerebral humor. Slapstick and visual gags became more confined to Sunday strips, because as ''Garfield'' creator [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis]] put it, \"Children are more likely to read Sunday strips than dailies.\"\n\n===Second author===\nMany older strips are no longer drawn by the original cartoonist, who has either died or retired.  Such strips are known as \"[[zombie strip]]s\". A cartoonist, paid by the syndicate or sometimes a relative of the original cartoonist, continues writing the strip, a tradition that became commonplace in the early half of the 20th century. ''[[H\u00e4gar the Horrible]]'' and ''[[Frank and Ernest (comic strip)|Frank and Ernest]]'' are both drawn by the sons of the creators. Some strips which are still in affiliation with the original creator are produced by small teams or entire companies, such as Jim Davis' ''Garfield'', however there is some debate if these strips fall in this category.\n\nThis act is commonly criticized by modern cartoonists including Watterson and ''Pearls Before Swine'''s [[Stephan Pastis]]. The issue was addressed in six consecutive ''Pearls'' strips in 2005.<ref>[http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/?DateAfter=2005-09-19&DateBefore=2009-12-18&Order=d.DateStrip+ASC&PerPage=10&x=36&y=15&Search=blondie ''Pearls Before Swine''] at Comics.com</ref> [[Charles Schulz]], of ''[[Peanuts]]'' fame, requested that his strip not be continued by another cartoonist after his death. He also rejected the idea of hiring an inker or letterer, comparing it to a golfer hiring a man to make his putts. Schulz's family has honored his wishes and refused numerous proposals by syndicators to continue ''Peanuts'' with a new author.\n\n====Assistants====\nSince the consolidation of newspaper comics by the first quarter of the 20th century, most cartoonists have used a group of assistants (with usually one of them credited). However, quite a few cartoonists (e.g.: [[George Herriman]] and Charles Schulz, among others) have done their strips almost completely by themselves; often criticizing the use of assistants for the same reasons most have about their editors hiring anyone else to continue their work after their retirement.\n\n===Rights to the strips===\nHistorically, syndicates [[Creator ownership in comics|owned the creators' work]], enabling them to continue publishing the strip after the original creator retired, left the strip, or died. This practice led to the term \"legacy strips,\" or more pejoratively \"[[zombie strip]]s\"). Most syndicates signed creators to 10- or even 20-year contracts. (There have been exceptions, however, such as [[Bud Fisher]]'s ''[[Mutt and Jeff]]'' being an early \u2014 if not the earliest \u2014 case in which the creator retained ownership of his work.) Both these practices began to change with the 1970 debut of [[Universal Press Syndicate]], as the company gave cartoonists a 50-percent ownership share of their work. [[Creators Syndicate]], founded in 1987, granted artists full rights to the strips,<ref name=\"Superhero\">{{cite news |page=34 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 14, 1987 |title= A Superhero For Cartoonists?|author=Katina Alexander |accessdate=August 18, 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/14/business/a-superhero-for-cartoonists.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm}}</ref> something that Universal Press did in 1990, followed by [[King Features]] in 1995. By 1999 both [[Tribune Media Services]] and [[United Feature]] had begun granting ownership rights to creators (limited to new and/or hugely popular strips).{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Censorship===\nStarting in the late 1940s, the national syndicates which distributed newspaper comic strips subjected them to very strict censorship. ''[[Li'l Abner]]'' was censored in September 1947 and was pulled from the [[Pittsburg Press]] by [[E.W.

Stephan Pastis has lamented that the \"unwritten\" censorship code is still \"stuck somewhere in the 1950s.\" Generally, comics are not allowed to include such words as \"damn\", \"sucks\", \"screwed\", and \"hell\", although there have been exceptions such as the September 22, 2010 ''[[Mother Goose and Grimm]]'' in which an elderly man says, \"This nursing home food sucks,\" and a pair of ''Pearls Before Swine'' comics from January 11, 2011 with a character named Ned using the word \"crappy\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grimmy.com/comics.php |title=Mother Goose and Grimm/Mike Peters Website |publisher=Grimmy.com |date=1994-01-01 |accessdate=2012-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-10/ |title=Pearls Before Swine Comic Strip, January 10, 2011 on GoComics.com |publisher=Comics.com |date=2011-01-10 |accessdate=2012-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110115200207/http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-10/ |archive-date=January 15, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-11/ |title=Pearls Before Swine Comic Strip, January 11, 2011 on GoComics.com |publisher=Comics.com |date=2011-01-11 |accessdate=2012-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124191330/http://comics.com/pearls_before_swine/2011-01-11/ |archive-date=January 24, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Naked backsides and shooting guns cannot be shown, according to ''[[Dilbert]]'' cartoonist [[Scott Adams]].{{sfn|Adams|2007}} Such comic strip taboos were detailed in [[Dave Breger]]'s book ''But That's Unprintable'' (Bantam, 1955).\n\nMany issues such as [[sex]], [[narcotics]], and [[terrorism]] cannot or can very rarely be openly discussed in strips, although there are exceptions, usually for [[satire]], as in ''Bloom County''. This led some cartoonists to resort to [[double entendre]] or dialogue children do not understand, as in [[Greg Evans (cartoonist)|Greg Evans]]' ''[[Luann (comic strip)|Luann]]''. Young cartoonists have claimed commonplace words, images, and issues should be allowed in the comics.

It states:\n{{quote|There is no set whose [[cardinality]] is strictly between that of the [[integer]]s and the [[real number]]s.}}\n\nThe continuum hypothesis was advanced by [[Georg Cantor]] in 1878, and\nestablishing its truth or falsehood is the first of [[Hilbert's problems|Hilbert's 23&nbsp;problems]] presented in 1900. \u03a4he answer to this problem is [[independence (mathematical logic)|independent]] of [[ZFC set theory]] (that is, Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory with the [[axiom of choice]] included), so that either the continuum hypothesis or its negation can be added as an axiom to ZFC set theory, with the resulting theory being consistent if and only if ZFC is consistent. This independence was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]], complementing earlier work by [[Kurt G\u00f6del]] in 1940.\n\nThe name of the hypothesis comes from the term ''[[continuum (set theory)|the continuum]]'' for the real numbers.\n==History==\nCantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain {{harv|Dauben|1990}}. It became the first on David Hilbert's [[Hilbert's problems|list of important open questions]] that was presented at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in the year 1900 in Paris. [[Axiomatic set theory]] was at that point not yet formulated. \n[[Kurt G\u00f6del]] proved in 1940 that the negation of the continuum hypothesis, i.e., the existence of a set with intermediate cardinality, could not be proved in standard set theory.  The second half of the independence of the continuum hypothesis \u2013 i.e., unprovability of the nonexistence of an intermediate-sized set \u2013 was proved in 1963 by [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].\n\n==Cardinality of infinite sets==\n{{Main|Cardinal number}}\n\nTwo sets are said to have the same ''[[cardinality]]'' or ''[[cardinal number]]'' if there exists a [[bijection]] (a one-to-one correspondence) between them. Intuitively, for two sets ''S'' and ''T'' to have the same cardinality means that it is possible to \"pair off\" elements of ''S'' with elements of ''T'' in such a fashion that every element of ''S'' is paired off with exactly one element of ''T'' and vice versa. Hence, the set {banana, apple, pear} has the same cardinality as {yellow, red, green}.\n\nWith infinite sets such as the set of [[integer]]s or [[rational number]]s, the existence of a bijection between two sets becomes more difficult to demonstrate. The rational numbers seemingly form a counterexample to the continuum hypothesis: the integers form a proper subset of the rationals, which themselves form a proper subset of the reals, so intuitively, there are more rational numbers than integers and more real numbers than rational numbers.  However, this intuitive analysis is flawed; it does not take proper account of the fact that all three sets are [[infinite set|infinite]].  It turns out the rational numbers can actually be placed in one-to-one correspondence with the integers, and therefore the set of rational numbers is the same size (''cardinality'') as the set of integers: they are both [[countable set]]s.\n\nCantor gave two proofs that the cardinality of the set of [[integer]]s is strictly smaller than that of the set of [[real number]]s (see [[Cantor's first uncountability proof]] and [[Cantor's diagonal argument]]). His proofs, however, give no indication of the extent to which the cardinality of the integers is less than that of the real numbers. Cantor proposed the continuum hypothesis as a possible solution to this question.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis states that the set of real numbers has minimal possible cardinality which is greater than the cardinality of the set of integers. That is, every set, ''S'', of real numbers can either be mapped one-to-one into the integers or the real numbers can be mapped one-to-one into ''S''. Using the fact that the real numbers are [[equinumerous]] with the powerset of the integers, the continuum hypothesis says that there is no set <math>S</math> for which <math> \\aleph_0 < |S| < 2^{\\aleph_0}. </math>\n\nAssuming the [[axiom of choice]], [[aleph numbers|there is a smallest cardinal number <math>\\aleph_1</math> greater than <math>\\aleph_0</math>]], and the continuum hypothesis is in turn equivalent to the equality <math>2^{\\aleph_0} = \\aleph_1. </math>\n\nThere is also a generalization of the continuum hypothesis called the '''generalized continuum hypothesis''' ('''GCH''') which says that for every [[Ordinal number|ordinal]] &alpha;, <math>2^{\\aleph_\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}.</math> That is, GCH asserts that the cardinality of the [[power set]] of each infinite set is the smallest cardinality greater than that of the set.\n\n==Independence from ZFC==\n\nThe independence of the continuum hypothesis (CH) from [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]] (ZF) follows from combined work of [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]  and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]].\n\n{{harvtxt|G\u00f6del|1940}} showed that CH cannot be disproved from ZF, even if the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) is adopted (making ZFC). G\u00f6del's proof shows that CH and AC both hold in the [[constructible universe]] L, an [[inner model]] of ZF set theory, assuming only the axioms of ZF.  The existence of an inner model of ZF  in which additional axioms hold shows that the additional axioms are [[consistent]] with ZF, provided ZF itself is consistent. The latter condition cannot be proved in ZF itself, due to [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems]], but is widely believed to be true and can be proved in stronger set theories.\n\nCohen ([[#{{harvid|Cohen|1963}}|1963]], [[#{{harvid|Cohen|1964}}|1964]]) showed that CH cannot be proven from the ZFC axioms, completing the overall independence proof.  To prove his result, Cohen developed the method of [[Forcing (mathematics)|forcing]], which has become a standard tool in set theory.  Essentially, this method begins with a model of ZF in which CH holds, and constructs another model which contains more sets than the original, in a way that CH does not hold in the new model. Cohen was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1966 for his proof.\n\nThe independence proof just described shows that CH is independent of ZFC. Further research has shown that CH is independent of all known ''[[large cardinal axiom]]s'' in the context of ZFC. ({{harvtxt|Feferman|1999}})   Moreover, it has been shown that the cardinality of the continuum can be any cardinal consistent with [[K\u00f6nig's theorem (set theory)|K\u00f6nig's theorem]]. A result of Solovay, proved shortly after Cohen's result on the independence of the continuum hypothesis, shows that in any model of ZFC, if <math>\\kappa</math> is a cardinal of uncountable [[cofinality]], then there is a forcing extension in which <math>2^{\\aleph_0} = \\kappa</math>. However, per K\u00f6nig's theorem, it is not consistent to assume <math>2^{\\aleph_0}</math> is <math>\\aleph_\\omega</math> or <math>\\aleph_{\\omega_1+\\omega}</math> or any cardinal with cofinality <math>\\omega</math>.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis is closely related to many statements in [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], point set [[topology]] and [[measure theory]]. As a result of its independence, many substantial [[conjecture]]s in those fields have subsequently been shown to be independent as well.\n\nThe independence from ZFC means that proving or disproving the CH within ZFC is impossible.  However, G\u00f6del and Cohen's negative results are not universally accepted as disposing of all interest in the continuum hypothesis. Hilbert's problem remains an active topic of research; see {{harvs|last=Woodin|year=2001a|year2=2001b|txt}} and {{harvtxt|Koellner|2011a}} for an overview of the current research status.\n\nThe continuum hypothesis was not the first statement shown to be independent of ZFC. An immediate consequence of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]], which was published in 1931, is that there is a formal statement (one for each appropriate [[G\u00f6del numbering]] scheme) expressing the consistency of ZFC that is independent of ZFC, assuming that ZFC is consistent. The continuum hypothesis and the [[axiom of choice]] were among the first mathematical statements shown to be independent of ZF set theory.\n\n==Arguments for and against the continuum hypothesis==\nG\u00f6del believed that CH is false, and that his proof that CH is consistent with ZFC only shows that the [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory|Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel]] axioms do not adequately characterize the universe of sets.  G\u00f6del was a [[Philosophy of mathematics#Platonism|platonist]] and therefore had no problems with asserting the truth and falsehood of statements independent of their provability. Cohen, though a [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalist]] {{harv|Goodman|1979}}, also tended towards rejecting CH.\n\nHistorically, mathematicians who favored a \"rich\" and \"large\" [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of sets were against CH, while those favoring a \"neat\" and \"controllable\" universe favored CH. Parallel arguments were made for and against the [[axiom of constructibility]], which implies CH. More recently, [[Matthew Foreman]] has pointed out that [[ontological maximalism]] can actually be used to argue in favor of CH, because among models that have the same reals, models with \"more\" sets of reals have a better chance of satisfying CH (Maddy 1988, p.&nbsp;500).\n\nAnother viewpoint is that the conception of set is not specific enough to determine whether CH is true or false. This viewpoint was advanced as early as 1923 by [[Skolem]], even before G\u00f6del's first incompleteness theorem. Skolem argued on the basis of what is now known as [[Skolem's paradox]], and it was later supported by the independence of CH from the axioms of ZFC since these axioms are enough to establish the elementary properties of sets and cardinalities. In order to argue against this viewpoint, it would be sufficient to demonstrate new axioms that are supported by intuition and resolve CH in one direction or another. Although the [[axiom of constructibility]] does resolve CH, it is not generally considered to be intuitively true any more than CH is generally considered to be false (Kunen 1980, p.&nbsp;171).\n\nAt least two other axioms have been proposed that have implications for the continuum hypothesis, although these axioms have not currently found wide acceptance in the mathematical community. In 1986, Chris Freiling presented an argument against CH by showing that the negation of CH is equivalent to [[Freiling's axiom of symmetry]], a statement about [[probability|probabilities]]. Freiling believes this axiom is \"intuitively true\" but others have disagreed. A difficult argument against CH developed by [[W. Hugh Woodin]] has attracted considerable attention since the year 2000 (Woodin 2001a, 2001b). Foreman (2003) does not reject Woodin's argument outright but urges caution.\n\n[[Solomon Feferman]] (2011) has made a complex philosophical argument that CH is not a definite mathematical problem.  He proposes a theory of \"definiteness\" using a semi-intuitionistic subsystem of ZF that accepts [[classical logic]] for bounded quantifiers but uses [[intuitionistic logic]] for unbounded ones, and suggests that a proposition <math>\\phi</math> is mathematically \"definite\" if the semi-intuitionistic theory can prove <math>(\\phi \\lor \\neg\\phi)</math>.  He conjectures that CH is not definite according to this notion, and proposes that CH should, therefore, be considered not to have a truth value. [[Peter Koellner]] (2011b) wrote a critical commentary on Feferman's article.\n\n[[Joel David Hamkins]] proposes a [[Multiverse (set theory)|multiverse]] approach to set theory and argues that \"the continuum hypothesis is settled on the multiverse view by our extensive knowledge about how it behaves in the multiverse, and, as a result, it can no longer be settled in the manner formerly hoped for.\" (Hamkins 2012). In a related vein, [[Saharon Shelah]] wrote that he does \"not agree with the pure Platonic view that the interesting problems in set theory can be decided, that we just have to discover the additional axiom. My mental picture is that we have many possible set theories, all conforming to ZFC.\" (Shelah 2003).\n\n==The generalized continuum hypothesis==<!-- This section is linked from [[Forcing (mathematics)]] -->\nThe ''generalized continuum hypothesis'' (GCH) states that if an infinite set's cardinality lies between that of an infinite set ''S'' and that of the [[power set]] of ''S'', then it either has the same cardinality as the set ''S'' or the same cardinality as the power set of ''S''. That is, for any [[infinite set|infinite]] [[cardinal number|cardinal]] <math>\\lambda</math> there is no cardinal <math>\\kappa</math> such that <math>\\lambda <\\kappa <2^{\\lambda}.</math> GCH is equivalent to:\n:<math>\\aleph_{\\alpha+1}=2^{\\aleph_\\alpha}</math> for every [[ordinal number|ordinal]] <math>\\alpha.</math>  (occasionally called '''Cantor's aleph hypothesis''')\nThe [[beth number]]s provide an alternate notation for this condition: <math>\\aleph_\\alpha=\\beth_\\alpha</math> for every ordinal <math>\\alpha.</math>\n\nThis is a generalization of the continuum hypothesis since the continuum has the same cardinality as the [[power set]] of the integers. It was first suggested by {{harvs|txt|last=Jourdain|authorlink=Philip Jourdain|year=1905}}. (For the early history of GCH, see {{harvs|txt|last=Moore|year=2011}}).\n\nLike CH, GCH is also independent of ZFC, but [[Wac\u0142aw Sierpi\u0144ski|Sierpi\u0144ski]] proved that ZF + GCH implies the [[axiom of choice]] (AC) (and therefore the negation of the [[axiom of determinacy]], AD), so choice and GCH are not independent in ZF; there are no models of ZF in which GCH holds and AC fails. To prove this, Sierpi\u0144ski showed GCH implies that every cardinality n is smaller than some [[Aleph number]], and thus can be ordered. This is done by showing that n is smaller than <math>2^{\\aleph_0+n}</math> which is  smaller than its own [[Hartogs number]]\u2014this uses the equality <math>2^{\\aleph_0+n}\\, = \\,2\\cdot\\,2^{\\aleph_0+n} </math>; for the full proof, see Gillman (2002).\n\n[[Kurt G\u00f6del]] showed that GCH is a consequence of ZF + [[Axiom of constructibility|V=L]] (the axiom that every set is constructible relative to the ordinals), and is therefore consistent with ZFC. As GCH implies CH, Cohen's model in which CH fails is a model in which GCH fails, and thus GCH is not provable from ZFC. W.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Easton used the method of forcing developed by Cohen to prove [[Easton's theorem]], which shows it is consistent with ZFC for arbitrarily large cardinals <math>\\aleph_\\alpha</math> to fail to satisfy <math>2^{\\aleph_\\alpha} = \\aleph_{\\alpha + 1}.</math> Much later, [[Matthew Foreman|Foreman]] and [[W. Hugh Woodin|Woodin]] proved that (assuming the consistency of very large cardinals) it is consistent that <math>2^\\kappa>\\kappa^+</math> holds for every infinite cardinal <math>\\kappa.</math> Later Woodin extended this by showing the consistency of <math>2^\\kappa=\\kappa^{++}</math> for every <math>\\kappa</math>. {{harvs|first=Carmi|last=Merimovich|year=2007|txt}} showed that, for each ''n''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1, it is consistent with ZFC that for each \u03ba, 2<sup>\u03ba</sup> is the ''n''th successor of \u03ba. On the other hand, {{harvs|first=L\u00e1szl\u00f3 |last=Patai|year=1930|txt}} proved, that if \u03b3 is an ordinal and for each infinite cardinal \u03ba, 2<sup>\u03ba</sup> is the \u03b3th successor of \u03ba, then \u03b3 is finite.\n\nFor any infinite sets A and B, if there is an injection from A to B then there is an injection from subsets of A to subsets of B. Thus for any infinite cardinals A and B, <math>A < B \\to 2^A \\le 2^B.</math> . If A and B are finite, the stronger inequality <math>A < B \\to 2^A < 2^B </math> holds. GCH implies that this strict, stronger inequality holds for infinite cardinals as well as finite cardinals.\n\n===Implications of GCH for cardinal exponentiation===\nAlthough the generalized continuum hypothesis refers directly only to cardinal exponentiation with 2 as the base, one can deduce from it the values of cardinal exponentiation <math>\\aleph_{\\alpha}^{\\aleph_{\\beta}}</math> in all cases. GCH implies that (see: Hayden & Kennison (1968), page 147, exercise 76):\n:<math>\\aleph_{\\alpha}^{\\aleph_{\\beta}} = \\aleph_{\\beta+1}</math> when ''\u03b1'' \u2264 ''\u03b2''+1;\n:<math>\\aleph_{\\alpha}^{\\aleph_{\\beta}} = \\aleph_{\\alpha}</math> when ''\u03b2''+1 < ''\u03b1'' and <math>\\aleph_{\\beta} < \\operatorname{cf} (\\aleph_{\\alpha})</math>, where '''cf''' is the [[cofinality]] operation; and\n:<math>\\aleph_{\\alpha}^{\\aleph_{\\beta}} = \\aleph_{\\alpha+1}</math> when ''\u03b2''+1 < ''\u03b1'' and <math>\\aleph_{\\beta} \\ge \\operatorname{cf} (\\aleph_{\\alpha})</math>.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aleph number]]\n*[[Beth number]]\n*[[Cardinality]]\n*[[\u03a9-logic]]\n*[[Wetzel's problem]]\n\n==References==\n<!--\nThis article uses parenthetical citations.

As such, one's sense of self depends on and is defined in part by those around them and is primarily manifested in public, overt behavior. As such, the organization of the self is guided by using others as a reference. That is, an interdependent individual uses the unexpressed thoughts, feelings, and beliefs of another person with whom they have a relationship with, as well as the other person's behaviors, to make decisions about their own internal attributes and actions.\n\nMarkus and Kitayama also contributed to the literature by challenging Hofstede's unidimensional model of collectivism-individualism.<ref name=\":3\" /> The authors conceptualized these two constructs bidimensionally, such that both collectivism and individualism can be endorsed independently and potentially to the same degree. This notion has been echoed by other prominent theorists in the field.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Singelis|first=T.|date=1994|title=The measurement of independent and interdependent self-construal|url=|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=20|pages=580\u2013591|via=|doi=10.1177/0146167294205014}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|title=INDCOL (Unpublished research scale on individualism and collectivism)|last=Triandis|first=H.

Horizontal relationships are believed to be status-equal whereas vertical relationships are characterized as hierarchical and status-unequal. As such, horizontal collectivism is manifested as an orientation in which group harmony is highly valued and in-group members are perceived to experience equal standing. Vertical collectivism involves the prioritization of group goals over individual goals, implying a hierarchical positioning of the self in relation to the overarching in-group. The horizontal-vertical individualism-collectivism model has received empirical support and has been used to explore patterns within cultures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Komarraju, M., & Cokley, K.

These include institutional collectivism and in-group collectivism. Institutional collectivism is the idea that a work environment creates a sense of collectivist nature due to similar statuses and similar rewards, such as earning the same salary.

Originally, another subject of the split was whether to embrace [[devolution]] as a first step to full [[independence]] (or as the sole step if this was what the electorate wished) or for it to be \"all or nothing\".<ref name=\"westbriton\" />\n\nThe CNP essentially represented a more [[right-wing]] outlook from those who disagree that economic arguments were more likely to win votes than cultural.

Methods for breaking modern [[cryptosystem]]s often involve solving carefully constructed problems in [[pure mathematics]], the best-known being [[integer factorization]].\n\n==Overview==\nGiven some encrypted data (''\"[[ciphertext]]\"''), the goal of the ''cryptanalyst'' is to gain as much information as possible about the original, unencrypted data (''\"[[plaintext]]\"''). It is useful to consider two aspects of achieving this. The first is ''breaking'' the system \u2014 that is discovering how the encipherment process works. The second is ''solving'' the key that is unique for a particular encrypted message or group of messages.\n\n===Amount of information available to the attacker===\nAttacks can be classified based on what type of information the attacker has available. As a basic starting point it is normally assumed that, for the purposes of analysis, the general [[algorithm]] is known; this is [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's Maxim]] \"the enemy knows the system\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shannon|first1=Claude|title=Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems|journal=Bell System Technical Journal|date=4 October 1949|volume=28|page=662|url=https://archive.org/stream/bstj28-4-656#page/n5/mode/2up|accessdate=20 June 2014|ref=Shannon}}</ref> \u2014 in its turn, equivalent to [[Kerckhoffs' principle]]<ref>{{citation |first = David |last = Kahn |title = The Codebreakers: the story of secret writing  |year = 1996 |edition=second |publisher = Scribners |p=235}}</ref>. This is a reasonable assumption in practice \u2014 throughout history, there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge, variously through [[espionage]], [[betrayal]] and [[reverse engineering]]. (And on occasion, ciphers have been broken through pure deduction; for example, the German [[Lorenz cipher]] and the Japanese [[Purple code]], and a variety of classical schemes):<ref>{{cite book|author=Schmeh, Klaus|title=Cryptography and public key infrastructure on the Internet|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2003|isbn=978-0-470-84745-9|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9NqidkUqHdgC&pg=PA45}}</ref>\n*''[[Ciphertext-only attack|Ciphertext-only]]'': the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of [[ciphertext]]s or [[codetext]]s.\n*''[[Known-plaintext attack|Known-plaintext]]'': the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which he knows the corresponding [[plaintext]].\n*''[[Chosen plaintext attack|Chosen-plaintext]]'' (''[[chosen-ciphertext attack|chosen-ciphertext]]''): the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts (plaintexts) corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts (ciphertexts) of his own choosing.\n*''[[Adaptive chosen plaintext attack|Adaptive chosen-plaintext]]'': like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can choose subsequent plaintexts based on information learned from previous encryptions. Similarly ''[[Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack]]''.\n*''[[Related-key attack]]'': Like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys. The keys are unknown, but the relationship between them is known; for example, two keys that differ in the one bit.\n\n===Computational resources required===\nAttacks can also be characterised by the resources they require. Those resources include:{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n*Time \u2014 the number of ''computation steps'' (e.g., test encryptions) which must be performed.\n*Memory \u2014 the amount of ''storage'' required to perform the attack.\n*Data \u2014 the quantity and type of ''plaintexts and ciphertexts'' required for a particular approach.\n\nIt's sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely, especially when the attack isn't practical to actually implement for testing. But academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated ''order of magnitude'' of their attacks' difficulty, saying, for example, \"SHA-1 collisions now 2<sup>52</sup>.\"<ref>{{Citation | last = McDonald | first = Cameron | last2 = Hawkes | first2 = Philip | last3 = Pieprzyk | first3 = Josef | author3-link = Josef Pieprzyk | title =SHA-1 collisions now 2<sup>52</sup> | url = http://eurocrypt2009rump.cr.yp.to/837a0a8086fa6ca714249409ddfae43d.pdf | accessdate = 4 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Bruce Schneier]] notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks: \"Breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force. Never mind that brute-force might require 2<sup>128</sup> encryptions; an attack requiring 2<sup>110</sup> encryptions would be considered a break...simply put, a break can just be a certificational weakness: evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised.\"<ref name=\"schneier\"/><!-- Birthday attacks; man in the middle / time-memory tradeoff -->\n\n===Partial breaks===\nThe results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness. For example, cryptographer [[Lars Knudsen]] (1998) classified various types of attack on [[block cipher]]s according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered:\n*''Total break'' \u2014 the attacker deduces the secret [[key (cryptography)|key]].\n*''Global deduction'' \u2014 the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent [[algorithm]] for encryption and decryption, but without learning the key.\n*''Instance (local) deduction'' \u2014 the attacker discovers additional plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.\n*''Information deduction'' \u2014 the attacker gains some [[Information entropy|Shannon information]] about plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.\n*''Distinguishing algorithm'' \u2014 the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random [[permutation]].\n\nAcademic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem, such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed. Many, but not all, attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem,<ref>For an example of an attack that cannot be prevented by additional rounds, see [[slide attack]].</ref> so it's possible for the full cryptosystem to be strong even though reduced-round variants are weak. Nonetheless, partial breaks that come close to breaking the original cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow; the successful attacks on [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], [[MD5]], and [[SHA-1]] were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions.\n\nIn academic cryptography, a ''weakness'' or a ''break'' in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively: it might require impractical amounts of time, memory, or known plaintexts. It also might require the attacker be able to do things many real-world attackers can't: for example, the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for plaintexts to be encrypted using several keys related to the secret key. Furthermore, it might only reveal a small amount of information, enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to real-world attackers. Finally, an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools, like a reduced-round block cipher, as a step towards breaking of the full system.<ref name=schneier>{{Harvnb|Schneier|2000}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of cryptography}}\n[[Image:Zimmermann-telegramm-offen.jpg|thumb|right|The decrypted [[Zimmermann Telegram]].]]\nCryptanalysis has [[coevolution|coevolved]] together with cryptography, and the contest can be traced through the [[history of cryptography]]\u2014new [[cipher]]s being designed to replace old broken designs, and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes. In practice, they are viewed as two sides of the same coin: secure cryptography requires design against possible cryptanalysis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nSuccessful cryptanalysis has undoubtedly influenced history; the ability to read the presumed-secret thoughts and plans of others can be a decisive advantage. For example, in England in 1587, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] was tried and executed for [[treason]] as a result of her involvement in three plots to assassinate [[Elizabeth I of England]]. The plans came to light after her coded correspondence with fellow conspirators was deciphered by [[Thomas Phelippes]].\n\nIn [[World War I]], the breaking of the [[Zimmermann Telegram]] was instrumental in bringing the United States into the war. In [[World War II]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] benefitted enormously from their joint success cryptanalysis of the German ciphers \u2014 including the [[Enigma machine]] and the [[Lorenz cipher]] \u2014 and Japanese ciphers, particularly [[Purple (cipher machine)|'Purple']] and [[JN-25]]. [[Ultra (cryptography)|'Ultra']] intelligence has been credited with everything between shortening the end of the European war by up to two years, to determining the eventual result. The war in the Pacific was similarly helped by [[Magic (cryptography)|'Magic']] intelligence.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=4}}</ref>\n\nGovernments have long recognized the potential benefits of cryptanalysis for [[Military espionage|intelligence]], both military and diplomatic, and established dedicated organizations devoted to breaking the codes and ciphers of other nations, for example, [[GCHQ]] and the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], organizations which are still very active today. In 2004, it was reported that the United States had broken [[Iran]]ian ciphers. (It is unknown, however, whether this was pure cryptanalysis, or whether other factors were involved:<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3804895.stm | work=BBC News | title=Breaking codes: An impossible task? | date=June 21, 2004}}</ref>).\n\n===Classical ciphers===\n[[Image:Al-kindi-cryptanalysis.png|thumb|right|First page of [[Al-Kindi]]'s 9th century ''Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages'']]\n{{See also|Frequency analysis|Index of coincidence|Kasiski examination}}\n\nAlthough the actual word \"''cryptanalysis''\" is relatively recent (it was coined by [[William Friedman]] in 1920), methods for breaking [[code (cryptography)|codes]] and [[cipher]]s are much older.

This treatise includes a description of the method of [[frequency analysis]] ([[Ibrahim Al-Kadi]], 1992- ref-3). [[Italy|Italian]] scholar [[Giambattista della Porta]] was author of a seminal work on cryptanalysis ''\"De Furtivis Literarum Notis\".''<ref>[http://www.cryptool.org/content/view/28/54/lang,english/ Crypto History ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828190150/http://www.cryptool.org/content/view/28/54/lang%2Cenglish/ |date=August 28, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n[[Frequency analysis]] is the basic tool for breaking most [[classical cipher]]s. In natural languages, certain letters of the [[alphabet]] appear more often than others; in [[English language|English]], \"[[E]]\" is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of [[plaintext]]. Similarly, the [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]] \"TH\" is the most likely pair of letters in English, and so on. Frequency analysis relies on a cipher failing to hide these [[statistics]]. For example, in a [[simple substitution cipher]] (where each letter is simply replaced with another), the most frequent letter in the [[ciphertext]] would be a likely candidate for \"E\". Frequency analysis of such a cipher is therefore relatively easy, provided that the ciphertext is long enough to give a reasonably representative count of the letters of the alphabet that it contains.<ref>{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=17}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries, the idea of a [[Polyalphabetic cipher|polyalphabetic substitution cipher]] was developed, among others by the French diplomat [[Blaise de Vigen\u00e8re]] (1523\u201396).<ref>{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|pp=45\u201351}}</ref> For some three centuries, the [[Vigen\u00e8re cipher]], which uses a repeating key to select different encryption alphabets in rotation, was considered to be completely secure (''le chiffre ind\u00e9chiffrable''\u2014\"the indecipherable cipher\"). Nevertheless, [[Charles Babbage]] (1791\u20131871) and later, independently, [[Friedrich Kasiski]] (1805\u201381) succeeded in breaking this cipher.<ref>{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|pp=63\u201378}}</ref> During [[World War I]], inventors in several countries developed [[rotor cipher machine]]s such as [[Arthur Scherbius]]' [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], in an attempt to minimise the repetition that had been exploited to break the Vigen\u00e8re system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=116}}</ref>\n\n===Ciphers from World War I and World War II===\n{{See also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma|Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher}}\nCryptanalysis of enemy messages played a significant part in the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in World War II. [[F. W. Winterbotham]], quoted the western Supreme Allied Commander, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], at the war's end as describing [[Ultra]] intelligence as having been \"decisive\" to Allied victory.{{sfn|Winterbotham|2000|p=229}} [[Harry Hinsley|Sir Harry Hinsley]], official historian of British Intelligence in World War II, made a similar assessment about Ultra, saying that it shortened the war \"by not less than two years and probably by four years\"; moreover, he said that in the absence of Ultra, it is uncertain how the war would have ended.{{sfn|Hinsley|1993}}\n\nIn practice, frequency analysis relies as much on [[linguistics|linguistic]] knowledge as it does on statistics, but as ciphers became more complex, [[mathematics]] became more important in cryptanalysis. This change was particularly evident before and during [[World War II]], where efforts to crack [[Axis Powers|Axis]] ciphers required new levels of mathematical sophistication. Moreover, automation was first applied to cryptanalysis in that era with the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]] device, the British [[Bombe]], the use of [[punched card]] equipment, and in the [[Colossus computers]] \u2014 the first electronic digital computers to be controlled by a program.<ref>{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Singh|1999|p=244}}</ref>\n\n====Indicator====\nWith reciprocal machine ciphers such as the [[Lorenz cipher]] and the [[Enigma machine]] used by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]], each message had its own key. Usually, the transmitting operator informed the receiving operator of this message key by transmitting some plaintext and/or ciphertext before the enciphered message. This is termed the ''indicator'', as it indicates to the receiving operator how to set his machine to decipher the message.<ref>{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp=33, 34}}</ref>\n\nPoorly designed and implemented indicator systems allowed first [[Biuro Szyfr\u00f3w|Polish cryptographers]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|pp=97\u201399}}</ref> and then the British cryptographers at [[Bletchley Park]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=66}}</ref> to break the Enigma cipher system. Similar poor indicator systems allowed the British to identify ''depths'' that led to the diagnosis of the [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ40/42]] cipher system, and the comprehensive breaking of its messages without the cryptanalysts seeing the cipher machine.<ref name=\"Tutte 1998\">{{Harvnb|Tutte|1998}}</ref>\n\n====Depth====\nSending two or more messages with the same key is an insecure process. To a cryptanalyst the messages are then said to be ''\"in depth.\"''<ref>{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|p=34}}</ref> This may be detected by the messages having the same ''[[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]]'' by which the sending operator informs the receiving operator about the [[Key (cryptography)|key generator initial settings]] for the message.<ref>{{Harvnb|Churchhouse|2002|pp= 33, 86}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the cryptanalyst may benefit from lining up identical enciphering operations among a set of messages. For example, the [[Gilbert Vernam|Vernam cipher]] enciphers by bit-for-bit combining plaintext with a long key using the \"[[exclusive or]]\" operator, which is also known as \"[[Modular arithmetic|modulo-2 addition]]\" (symbolized by \u2295 ):\n::::Plaintext \u2295 Key = Ciphertext\nDeciphering combines the same key bits with the ciphertext to reconstruct the plaintext:\n::::Ciphertext \u2295 Key = Plaintext \n(In modulo-2 arithmetic, addition is the same as subtraction.) When two such ciphertexts are aligned in depth, combining them eliminates the common key, leaving just a combination of the two plaintexts:\n::::Ciphertext1 \u2295 Ciphertext2 = Plaintext1 \u2295 Plaintext2\nThe individual plaintexts can then be worked out linguistically by trying ''probable words'' (or phrases), also known as ''\"cribs,\"'' at various locations; a correct guess, when combined with the merged plaintext stream, produces intelligible text from the other plaintext component:\n::::(Plaintext1 \u2295 Plaintext2) \u2295 Plaintext1 = Plaintext2\nThe recovered fragment of the second plaintext can often be extended in one or both directions, and the extra characters can be combined with the merged plaintext stream to extend the first plaintext. Working back and forth between the two plaintexts, using the intelligibility criterion to check guesses, the analyst may recover much or all of the original plaintexts. (With only two plaintexts in depth, the analyst may not know which one corresponds to which ciphertext, but in practice this is not a large problem.) When a recovered plaintext is then combined with its ciphertext, the key is revealed:\n::::Plaintext1 \u2295 Ciphertext1 = Key\nKnowledge of a key of course allows the analyst to read other messages encrypted with the same key, and knowledge of a set of related keys may allow cryptanalysts to diagnose the system used for constructing them.<ref name=\"Tutte 1998\"/>\n\n===Development of modern cryptography===\n[[Image:TuringBombeBletchleyPark.jpg|thumb|The [[Bombe]] replicated the action of several [[Enigma machine]]s wired together. Each of the rapidly rotating drums, pictured above in a [[Bletchley Park]] museum mockup, simulated the action of an Enigma rotor.]]\n\nEven though computation was used to great effect in [[Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]] and other systems during World War II, it also made possible new methods of cryptography [[orders of magnitude]] more complex than ever before. Taken as a whole, modern cryptography has become much more impervious to cryptanalysis than the pen-and-paper systems of the past, and now seems to have the upper hand against pure cryptanalysis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The historian [[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] notes:\n\n{{quote|Many are the cryptosystems offered by the hundreds of commercial vendors today that cannot be broken by any known methods of cryptanalysis. Indeed, in such systems even a [[Chosen-plaintext attack|chosen plaintext attack]], in which a selected plaintext is matched against its ciphertext, cannot yield the key that unlock[s] other messages. In a sense, then, cryptanalysis is dead. But that is not the end of the story. Cryptanalysis may be dead, but there is - to mix my metaphors - more than one way to skin a cat.|<ref>[[David Kahn (writer)|David Kahn]] [https://fas.org/irp/eprint/kahn.html Remarks on the 50th Anniversary of the National Security Agency], November 1, 2002.</ref>}}\n\nKahn goes on to mention increased opportunities for interception, [[bugging]], [[side channel attack]]s, and [[quantum cryptography|quantum computers]] as replacements for the traditional means of cryptanalysis. In 2010, former NSA technical director Brian Snow said that both academic and government cryptographers are \"moving very slowly forward in a mature field.\"<ref>Tim Greene, Network World, [http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/030410-rsa-cloud-security-warning.html Former NSA tech chief: I don't trust the cloud] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308105556/http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/030410-rsa-cloud-security-warning.html |date=2010-03-08 }}. Retrieved March 14, 2010.</ref>\n\nHowever, any postmortems for cryptanalysis may be premature. While the effectiveness of cryptanalytic methods employed by intelligence agencies remains unknown, many serious attacks against both academic and practical cryptographic primitives have been published in the modern era of computer cryptography:{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n*The [[block cipher]] [[Madryga]], proposed in 1984 but not widely used, was found to be susceptible to [[ciphertext-only attack]]s in 1998.\n*[[FEAL|FEAL-4]], proposed as a replacement for the [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] standard encryption algorithm but not widely used, was demolished by a spate of attacks from the academic community, many of which are entirely practical.\n*The [[A5/1]], [[A5/2]], [[CMEA (cipher)|CMEA]], and [[DECT Standard Cipher|DECT]] systems used in [[mobile phone|mobile]] and wireless phone technology can all be broken in hours, minutes or even in real-time using widely available computing equipment.\n*[[Brute-force search|Brute-force keyspace search]] has broken some real-world ciphers and applications, including single-DES (see [[EFF DES cracker]]), [[Cryptography#Export controls|40-bit \"export-strength\" cryptography]], and the [[Content Scrambling System|DVD Content Scrambling System]].\n*In 2001, [[Wired Equivalent Privacy]] (WEP), a protocol used to secure [[Wi-Fi]] [[wireless network]]s, was shown to be breakable in practice because of a weakness in the [[RC4]] cipher and aspects of the WEP design that made [[related-key attack]]s practical. WEP was later replaced by [[Wi-Fi Protected Access]].\n*In 2008, researchers conducted a proof-of-concept break of [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] using weaknesses in the [[MD5]] [[Cryptographic hash function|hash function]] and certificate issuer practices that made it possible to exploit [[collision attack]]s on hash functions. The certificate issuers involved changed their practices to prevent the attack from being repeated.\n\nThus, while the best modern ciphers may be far more resistant to cryptanalysis than the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]], cryptanalysis and the broader field of [[information security]] remain quite active.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Symmetric ciphers==\n*[[Boomerang attack]]\n*[[Brute-force attack]]\n*[[Davies' attack]]\n*[[Differential cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Impossible differential cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Improbable differential cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Integral cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Linear cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Meet-in-the-middle attack]]\n*[[Mod-n cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Related-key attack]]\n*[[Sandwich attack]]\n*[[Slide attack]]\n*[[XSL attack]]\n\n==Asymmetric ciphers==\n[[Asymmetric cryptography]] (or [[public key cryptography]]) is cryptography that relies on using two (mathematically related) keys; one private, and one public. Such ciphers invariably rely on \"hard\" [[mathematical problem]]s as the basis of their security, so an obvious point of attack is to develop methods for solving the problem. The security of two-key cryptography depends on mathematical questions in a way that single-key cryptography generally does not, and conversely links cryptanalysis to wider mathematical research in a new way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAsymmetric schemes are designed around the (conjectured) difficulty of solving various mathematical problems. If an improved algorithm can be found to solve the problem, then the system is weakened. For example, the security of the [[Diffie\u2013Hellman key exchange]] scheme depends on the difficulty of calculating the [[discrete logarithm]]. In 1983, [[Don Coppersmith]] found a faster way to find discrete logarithms (in certain groups), and thereby requiring cryptographers to use larger groups (or different types of groups). RSA's security depends (in part) upon the difficulty of [[integer factorization]] \u2014 a breakthrough in factoring would impact the security of RSA.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nIn 1980, one could factor a difficult 50-digit number at an expense of 10<sup>12</sup> elementary computer operations. By 1984 the state of the art in factoring algorithms had advanced to a point where a 75-digit number could be factored in 10<sup>12</sup> operations. Advances in computing technology also meant that the operations could be performed much faster, too. [[Moore's law]] predicts that computer speeds will continue to increase. Factoring techniques may continue to do so as well, but will most likely depend on mathematical insight and creativity, neither of which has ever been successfully predictable. 150-digit numbers of the kind once used in RSA have been factored. The effort was greater than above, but was not unreasonable on fast modern computers. By the start of the 21st century, 150-digit numbers were no longer considered a large enough [[key size]] for RSA. Numbers with several hundred digits were still considered too hard to factor in 2005, though methods will probably continue to improve over time, requiring key size to keep pace or other methods such as [[elliptic curve cryptography]] to be used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\nAnother distinguishing feature of asymmetric schemes is that, unlike attacks on symmetric cryptosystems, any cryptanalysis has the opportunity to make use of knowledge gained from the [[public key]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Stallings|first=William|title=Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0136097049}}</ref>\n\n==Attacking cryptographic hash systems==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}\n*[[Birthday attack]]\n*[[Hash function security summary]]\n*[[Rainbow table]]\n\n==Side-channel attacks==\n{{Main|Side channel attack}}\n{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}\n*[[Black-bag cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Man-in-the-middle attack]]\n*[[Power analysis]]\n*[[Replay attack]]\n*[[Rubber-hose cryptanalysis]]\n*[[Timing attack|Timing analysis]]\n\n==Quantum computing applications for cryptanalysis==\n[[Quantum computer]]s, which are still in the early phases of research, have potential use in cryptanalysis.

The King and Kenedy firm submitted a voucher to the Joint Claims Commission of the United States in 1870 to cover the costs of this gunboat's conversion from a [[Steamboat|passenger steamer]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Chance |first=Joseph |title=Jose Maria de Jesus Carvajal: The Life and Times of a Mexican Revolutionary |date=2006 |publisher=Trinity University Press |location=San Antonio, Texas |page=195}}</ref> No particular explanation of the boat's name is known.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe origin of the word \"chicano\" is disputed. Some claim it is a shortened form of ''Mexicano'' (from the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] name for a member of the [[Mexica]], the indigenous [[Aztec]] people of Anahuac, the [[Valley of Mexico]]). The name ''Mexica'' as spoken in its original Nahuatl, and ''Mexico'' by the Spaniards at the time of the [[Conquistadors]], was pronounced originally with a [{{IPA link|\u0283}}] and was transcribed with an ''x'' during this time period.  According to this [[Etymology|etymological]] hypothesis, the difference between the pronunciation and spelling of ''chicano'' and ''mexicano'' stems from the fact that the modern-day Spanish language experienced a change in pronunciation regarding a majority of words containing the ''x'' (for example: M\u00e9xico, Ximenez, Xavier, Xarabe). In most cases the {{IPA|[\u0283]}} has been replaced with [{{IPA link|x}}] and a change of spelling (''x'' to ''j'', though this has not been done to ''Mexico'' and various other [[proper name]]s). The word ''Chicano'' would have also been affected by this change. Many Chicanos replace the ''ch'' with the letter ''x'', forming ''Xicano'', due to the original spelling of the Mexica Empire. In the United States, some Mexican-Americans choose the ''Xicano'' spelling to emphasize their indigenous ancestry.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = MUXERISTA PEDAGOGY: Raza Womyn Teaching Social Justice Through Student Activism|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/high_school_journal/v087/87.4revilla.html |journal=The High School Journal |date=January 1, 2004 |issn=1534-5157 |pages=87\u201388 |volume=87 |issue=4 |doi=10.1353/hsj.2004.0013 |first=Anita Tijerina |last=Revilla}}</ref>\n\nIn Mexico's indigenous regions, [[mestizo]]s<ref>Not to be confused with the language [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] of Spain and Portugal, a Spanish language spoken by Sephardic Jews of Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Israel and the USA.</ref> and Westernized natives are referred to as ''mexicanos'', referring to the modern nation, rather than the ''{{lang|es|pueblo}}'' (village or tribal) identification of the speaker, be it Mayan, Zapotec, Mixtec, Huasteco, or any of hundreds of other indigenous groups.  Thus, a newly emigrated Nahuatl speaker in an urban center might referred to his cultural relatives in this country, different from himself, as ''{{lang|es|mexicanos}}'', shortened to ''chicanos''.\n\nThe ''[[Handbook of Texas]]''{{full citation needed|date=October 2015}} combines the two ideas:\n{{quote|1=According to one explanation, the pre-Columbian tribes in Mexico called themselves [[Meshica]]s, and the Spaniards, employing the letter x (which at that time represented a {{IPA|[\u0283]}} and [{{IPA link|t\u0283}}]), spelled it ''Mexicas''. The Indians later referred to themselves as Meshicanos and even as Shicanos, thus giving birth to the term Chicano.}}\n\nSome {{who|date=June 2016}} believe that the early 20th-century Hispanic Texan epithet ''chicamo''  shifted into ''chicano'' to reflect the grammatical conventions of Spanish-language ethno- and [[demonym]]s, such as ''americano'', ''castellano'', and ''peruano''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, Chicanos generally do not agree that ''chicamo'' was ever a word used within the culture, as its assertion is thus far entirely unsubstantiated. Therefore, most self-identifying Chicanos do not agree that ''Chicano'' was ever derived from the word ''chicamo''.{{original research inline|date=October 2015}}\n\nAnother hypothesis is that ''chicano'' derives from the indigenous population of [[Guanajuato]], the [[Chichimecas]], combined with the word ''Mexicano''.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}  An alternative idea is that it is an altered form of ''Chilango'', meaning someone from Mexico City or Central Mexico (i.e. the highland states of [[Mexico (state)|M\u00e9xico]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Jalisco]], [[Puebla (state)|Puebla]] and [[Michoac\u00e1n]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} A similar notion is that the word derives from [[Chichen Itza]], the [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] temple ruin and its associated culture in Mexico's [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]]. ''Chicano'' would thus be a Hispanized word for ''Chichen'' and Mayans, rather than the Aztec or Nahua people.\n\nYet another etymological speculation is that it derives from the term ''Chileno'' (a person from [[Chile]]), by way of the [[Chilean American]] presence in mid 19th-century California, when miners from Chile arrived in the [[California Gold Rush]] (1848\u201351).{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} This seems dubious, as the term is not frequently used other than in reference to Mexican Americans, is certainly not primarily used for Chilean-Americans.\n\n== Distinction from ''Hispanic'' and ''Latino'' ==\n\n{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}\n\nChicanos, like many Mexicans, are [[Mestizos]] who have heritage of both [[indigenous American]] cultures and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], mainly Spanish, through colonization and immigration. The term ''[[Latino]]'' refers to a native or inhabitant of Latin America or a person of Latin American origin living in the U.S. \n\n''[[Hispanic]]'' refers literally to Spain, but, in effect, to those of Spanish-speaking descent;{{Cn|date=March 2018}} therefore, the two terms are misnomers inasmuch as they apply only by extension to Chicanos, who may identify primarily as Amerindian or simply Mexican, and who may speak Amerindian languages (and English) as well as Spanish. The term was first brought up in the 1970s but it was not until the 1990s that the term was used on the U.S. Census. Since then it has widely been use by politicians and the media. The correct amalgamation is Latin American or Latin Americans,{{Cn|date=March 2018}} as coined by the Portuguese in the 17th century.{{Cn|date=October 2017}}\n\n== Meanings ==\n{{refimprove section|date=November 2011}}\n{{See also|Chicano studies}}\n\nThe term's meanings are highly debatable, but self-described Chicanos view the term as a positive, self-identifying social construction. Outside of Mexican-American communities, and even within them, ''Chicano'' has sometimes been considered pejorative by those who do not prefer the term. Regardless, its implications are subjective, but usually consist of one or more of the following elements.\n\n=== Ethnic identity ===\n[[File:LA teens.jpg|thumb|[[Venice, California]], 1974]]\n\nFrom a popular perspective, the term ''Chicano'' became widely visible outside of Chicano communities during the American civil rights movement. It was commonly used during the mid-1960s by Mexican-American activists,<ref>Moore, J. W.; Cu\u00e9llar, A. B. (1970). ''Mexican Americans''. Ethnic Groups in American Life series. Englewood, Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall. p. 149. {{ISBN|978-0-13-579490-6}}.</ref> who, in attempts to assert their civil rights, tried to rid the word of its polarizing negative connotation by reasserting a unique ethnic identity and political consciousness, proudly identifying themselves as ''Chicanos''.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Federal Census Bureau provided no way for Mexican Americans or other Latinos to officially identify as a racial/ethnic category prior to 1980, when the broader-than-Mexican term \"[[Hispanic]]\" was first available as a self-identification in census forms, there is ample literary evidence to substantiate that ''Chicano'' is a long-standing [[endonym]], as a large body of Chicano literature pre-dates the 1950s.<ref name=\"ERIC\" />\n\n=== Political identity ===\nAccording to the ''[[Handbook of Texas]]'':\n\n{{quote|Inspired by the courage of the farmworkers, by the California strikes led by [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], and by the Anglo-American youth revolt of the period, many Mexican-American university students came to participate in a crusade for social betterment that was known as the Chicano movement. They used Chicano to denote their rediscovered heritage, their youthful assertiveness, and their militant agenda. Though these students and their supporters used Chicano to refer to the entire Mexican-American population, they understood it to have a more direct application to the politically active parts of the Tejano community.<ref>{{cite web |last=De Le\u00f3n |first=Arnoldo |title=Chicano |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/pfc02 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=March 4, 2013}}</ref>}}\n\nAt certain points in the 1970s, ''Chicano'' was the preferred term for reference to Mexican Americans, particularly in the scholarly literature.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} However, even though the term is politicized, its use fell out of favor as a means of referring to the entire population due to ignorance and due to the majority's attempt to impose Latino and Hispanic as misnomers. Because of this, ''Chicano'' has tended to refer to participants in Mexican-American activism.

For example, in the 1991 [[Culture Clash (performance troupe)|Culture Clash]] play ''A Bowl of Beings'', in response to [[Che Guevara]]'s demand for a definition of \"Chicano\", an \"armchair activist\" cries out, \"I still don't know!\".

As exemplified through its extensive use within el [[Plan de Santa B\u00e1rbara]], one of the primary documents responsible for the genesis of [[M.E.Ch.A.]] (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztl\u00e1n), Chicano is used by many as a reference to their indigenous ancestry and roots. The last word in [[M.E.Ch.A.]], [[Aztl\u00e1n]], is a [[Mexica]] reference to an ancestral homeland which historians have speculated is somewhere in northern Mexico or the southwest of the US.  [[M.E.Ch.A.]] is one example of how people have self-identified as Chicano as a means to identify with indigenous roots.\n\nAs [[Rub\u00e9n Salazar]] put it in \"Who is a Chicano?

In their ''Latinas in the United States: A Historical Encyclopedia'', Vicki Ru\u00edz and Virginia S\u00e1nchez report that demographic differences in the adoption of the term existed; because of the prior vulgar connotations, it was more likely to be used by males than females, and as well, less likely to be used among those in a higher socioeconomic status. Usage was also generational, with the more assimilated third-generation members (again, more likely male) likely to adopt the usage. This group was also younger, of more radical persuasion, and less-connected to a Mexican cultural heritage.<ref>Vicki L. Ruiz & Virginia Sanchez Korrol, editors.

Romance languages conserved the original standard (formerly shared with English) of counting the entire New World as a single America, as was the consensus in the [[Age of Discovery]]; to Spanish- and Portuguese-speakers in the Americas, they are just as ''americano'' as someone from Belgium would be European. Geological validation of the current English norm is bound by controversies and potential inconsistency, so the best explanation for both cases is mere [[Linguistic prescription|tradition]].<ref>There are generally three divisions of what Romance-language speakers regard as a single American continent, the terminology in Spanish being ''{{lang|es|norte}}'' (including Mexico), ''{{lang|es|centro}}'' (including the West Indies) and ''{{lang|es|sur}}'', with the middle element not being regarded as particularly bounded to either. The [[Plate tectonics|plate-tectonic]] divide would be evidence for the south and middle ones to closer tied; both the former [[isthmus]] that gave rise to the West Indies and the current isthmus are volcanic arcs from plate interactions, separate from the north/south dynamic, so their early geological \"belonging\" to a side are of little relevance.</ref>{{citation needed|date=October 2015|reason=That's not a reference citation, and needs to be recoded as a non-ref footnote.}}\n\n''{{lang|es|Norte\u00f1o}}'' refers to the Mexicans of Northern Mexico as opposed to ''{{lang|es|sure\u00f1o}}''.

According to the [[Aztec]] legend, Aztl\u00e1n is a region; [[Chicano nationalist]]s have equated it with the Southwestern United States.\nSome historians may place Aztl\u00e1n in [[Nayarit]] or the Caribbean while other historians entirely disagree, and make a distinction between legend and the contemporary socio-political ideology.\n\n== Political aspects ==\n[[File:Cesar chavez crop2.jpg|[[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]] at a [[United Farmworkers]] rally, 1974|thumb|upright]]\n\nMany currents came together to produce the revived Chicano political movement of the 1960s and 1970s. Early struggles were against school segregation, but the Mexican-American cause, or ''{{lang|es|la Causa}}'' as it was called, soon came under the banner of the [[United Farm Workers]] and [[C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]]. However, [[Corky Gonzales]] and [[Reies Tijerina]] stirred up old tensions about [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] land claims with roots going back to before the [[Mexican\u2013American War]]. Simultaneous movements like the [[Young Lords]], to empower youth, question patriarchy, democratize the [[Catholic Church|Church]], end police brutality, and end the [[Vietnam War]], all intersected with other [[ethnic nationalist]], [[peace movement|peace]], [[countercultural]], and feminist movements.\n\nSince [[Chicanismo]] covers a wide array of political, religious and ethnic beliefs, and not everybody agrees with what exactly a Chicano is, most new Latino immigrants see it as a lost cause, as a lost culture, because Chicanos do not identify with Mexico or wherever their parents migrated from as new immigrants do. Chicanoism is an appreciation of a historical movement, but also is used by many to bring a new revived politicized feeling to voters young and old in the defense of Mexican and Mexican-American rights. People descended from Aztlan (both in the contemporary U.S. and in Mexico) use the Chicano ideology to create a platform for fighting for immigration reform and equality for all people.\n\n=== Rejection of borders ===\n\nFor some, Chicano ideals involve a rejection of borders. The 1848 [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] transformed the Rio Grande region from a rich cultural center to a rigid border poorly enforced by the United States government. At the end of the Mexican\u2013American War, 80,000 Spanish-Mexican-Indian people were forced into sudden U.S. habitation.<ref name=Castro>{{cite book\n | author = Castro, Rafaela G.\n | title = Chicano Folklore\n | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]\n | location = New York\n | year = 2001\n | isbn = 978-0-19-514639-4\n }}</ref> As a result, Chicano identification is aligned with the idea of [[Aztl\u00e1n]], which extends to the Aztec period of Mexico, celebrating a time preceding land division.<ref name=\"Hurtado\">{{cite book\n |author1=Hurtado, Aida |author2=Gurin, Patricia | title = Chicana/o Identity in a Changing U.S. Society\n | publisher = [[University of Arizona Press]]\n | location = Tucson\n | year = 2003\n | pages = 10\u201391\n | isbn = 978-0-8165-2205-7\n | oclc = 54074051\n}}</ref>\n\nPaired with the dissipation of militant political efforts of the Chicano movement in the 1960s was the emergence of the Chicano generation.

Ethnic cohesiveness is a resistance strategy to assimilation and the accompanying cultural dissolution.\n\nMexican nationalists in Mexico, however, condemn the advocates of Chicanoism for attempting to create a new identity for the Mexican-American population, distinct from that of the Mexican nation. Chicanoism is embraced through personal identity especially within small rural communities that integrate the American culture connected to the Mexican heritage practiced in different parts of Mexico. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/02/cinco-de-mayo-open-challenge-to-chicano.html |title=Cinco de Mayo: An open challenge to Chicano Nationalists |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203105243/http://www.nacionalistas.org/2012/02/cinco-de-mayo-open-challenge-to-chicano.html |archivedate=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n== Cultural aspects ==\n{{Main|Chicanismo}}\nThe term ''Chicano'' is also used to describe the literary, artistic, and musical movements that emerged with the [[Chicano Movement]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n{{Main|Chicano literature|Chicano poetry}}\nChicano literature tends to focus on themes of identity, discrimination, and culture, with an emphasis on validating Mexican-American and Chicano culture in the United States. [[Rodolfo Gonzales|Rodolfo \"Corky\" Gonzales]]'s [[I Am Joaquin|\"Yo Soy Joaquin\"]] is one of the first examples of explicitly Chicano poetry, while [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Villarreal]]'s ''Pocho'' is widely recognized as the first major Chicano novel. \n\nThe novel ''Chicano'', by Richard Vasquez, was the first novel about Mexican Americans to be released by a major publisher (Doubleday, 1970). It was widely read in high schools and universities during the 1970s, and is now recognized as a breakthrough novel. Vasquez's social themes have been compared with those found in the work of [[Upton Sinclair]] and [[John Steinbeck]]. \n\nOther major names include [[Norma Elia Cant\u00fa]], [[Rudolfo Anaya]], [[Sandra Cisneros]], [[Gary Soto]], [[Sergio Troncoso]], [[Rigoberto Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Raul Salinas]], [[Oscar Zeta Acosta]], [[Daniel Olivas]], [[John Rechy]], [[Ana Castillo]], [[Denise Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz]], [[Lu\u00eds Alberto Urrea]], [[Dagoberto Gilb]], [[Alicia Gaspar de Alba]], [[Luis J. Rodriguez]], [[Pat Mora]], and [[Gloria Anzald\u00faa]].\n\n=== Visual arts ===\nIn the visual arts, works by Chicanos address similar themes as works in literature. The preferred media for Chicano art are [[mural]]s and [[graphic art]]s. [[San Diego]]'s [[Chicano Park]], home to the largest collection of murals in the world, was created as an outgrowth of the city's political movement by Chicanos. [[Rasquache]] art is a unique style subset of the Chicano Arts movement.\n\nChicano art emerged in the mid-60s as a necessary component to the urban and agrarian civil rights movement in the Southwest, known as ''{{lang|es|la causa chicana}}'', ''{{lang|es|la Causa}}'', or the Chicano Renaissance. The artistic spirit, based on historical and traditional cultural evolution, within the movement has continued into the present millennium. There are artists, for example, who have chosen to do work within ancestral/historical references or who have mastered traditional techniques. Some artists and crafters have transcended the motifs, forms, functions, and context of Chicano references in their work but still acknowledge their identity as Chicano. These emerging artists are incorporating new materials to present mixed-media, digital media, and transmedia works.\n\nChicano performance art blends humor and pathos for [[tragicomic]] effect as shown by Los Angeles' comedy troupe [[Culture Clash (performance troupe)|Culture Clash]] and Mexican-born performance artist [[Guillermo G\u00f3mez-Pe\u00f1a]] and [[Nao Bustamante]] is a Chicana artist known internationally for her conceptual art pieces and as a participant in ''[[Work of Art: The Next Great Artist]]'', produced by [[Sarah Jessica Parker]]. [[Lalo Alcaraz]] often depicts the issues of Chicanos in his cartoon series called \"La Cucaracha\".\n\nOne of the most powerful and far-reaching cultural aspects of Chicano culture is the indigenous current that strongly roots Chicano culture to the American continent. It also unifies ''{{lang|es|Chicanismo}}'' within the larger [[Pan-Indian Movement]]. Since its arrival in 1974, an [[art movement]] known as ''{{lang|es|[[Danza Azteca]]}}'' in the U.S., (and known by several names in its homeland of the central States of Mexico: ''{{lang|es|Danza Conchera}}'', ''{{lang|es|De la Conquista}}'', ''{{lang|es|Chichimeca}}'', and so on.) has had a deep impact in Chicano muralism, graphic design, [[Flash (tattoo)|tattoo art (flash)]], poetry, music, and literature. [[Lowrider]] cars also figure prominently as functional art in the Chicano community.\n\n=== Music ===\n[[Lalo Guerrero]] has been lauded as the \"father of Chicano music\".<ref>Cordelia Ch\u00e1vez Candelaria, Peter J. Garc\u00e2ia, Arturo J. Aldama, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Latino Popular Culture'', Vol. 1: A\u2013L; Greenwood Publishing Group, (2004) p. 135.</ref> Beginning in the 1930s, he wrote songs in the [[big band]] and [[Swing (music)|swing]] genres that were popular at the time. He expanded his repertoire to include songs written in traditional genres of [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]], and during the farmworkers' rights campaign, wrote music in support of C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez and the United Farm Workers.\n\n[[Jeffrey Lee Pierce]] of [[The Gun Club]] often spoke about being half Mexican and growing up with the Chicano culture.\n\nOther Chicano/Mexican-American singers include [[Selena]], who sang a mixture of Mexican, [[Tejano music|Tejano]], and American popular music, but died in 1995 at the age of 23; [[Zack de la Rocha]], lead vocalist of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[social activist]]; and [[Los Lonely Boys]], a Texas-style country rock band who have not ignored their Mexican-American roots in their music. In recent years, a growing Tex-Mex polka band trend influenced by the ''{{lang|es|[[conjunto]]}}'' and ''{{lang|es|[[Norte\u00f1o (music)|norte\u00f1o]]}}'' music of Mexican immigrants, has in turn influenced much new Chicano [[folk music]], especially on large-market Spanish language radio stations and on television music video programs in the U.S.  Some of these artists, like the band [[Quetzal (band)|Quetzal]], are known for the political content of political songs.\n\n==== Rock ====\n{{Main|Chicano rock}}\nIn the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, a wave of Chicano pop music surfaced through innovative musicians [[Carlos Santana]], [[Johnny Rodriguez]], [[Ritchie Valens]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]]. [[Joan Baez]], who was also of Mexican-American descent, included Hispanic themes in some of her protest folk songs. Chicano rock is [[rock and roll|rock music]] performed by Chicano groups or music with themes derived from Chicano culture.\n\nThere are two undercurrents in Chicano rock. One is a devotion to the original [[rhythm and blues]] roots of Rock and roll including [[Ritchie Valens]], [[Sunny and the Sunglows]], and [[? and the Mysterians]]. Groups inspired by this include [[Sir Douglas Quintet]], [[Thee Midniters]], [[Los Lobos]], [[War (band)|War]], [[Tierra (group)|Tierra]], and [[El Chicano]], and, of course, the Chicano Blues Man himself, the late Randy Garribay.\n\nThe second theme is the openness to Latin American sounds and influences. [[Trini Lopez]], [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Malo (band)|Malo]], [[Azteca (band)|Azteca]], Toro, [[Ozomatli]] and other Chicano [[Latin rock]] groups follow this approach.

Some music historians argue that Chicanos of Los Angeles in the late 1970s might have independently co-founded punk rock along with the already-acknowledged founders from British-European sources when introduced to the US in major cities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The rock band [[? and the Mysterians]], which was composed primarily of Mexican-American musicians, was the first band to be described as punk rock.

While [[Mellow Man Ace]] was the first mainstream rapper to use [[Spanglish]], Frost's song \"La Raza\" paved the way for its use in [[American hip hop]]. Chicano rap tends to discuss themes of importance to young urban Chicanos. Some of today's Chicano artists include [[A.L.T.]], [[Lil Rob]], [[Psycho Realm]], [[Baby Bash]], [[Serio (rapper)|Serio]], [[A Lighter Shade of Brown]], and [[Funky Aztecs]].\n\n==== Pop and R&B ====\n[[Paula DeAnda]], [[Frankie J]], and [[Victor Ivan Santos]] (early member of the [[Kumbia Kings]] and associated with Baby Bash).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Latino and Hispanic American}}\n\n* [[History of Mexican Americans]]\n* [[Cal\u00f3 (Chicano)]]\n* [[Casta]]\n* [[Chicanismo]]\n* [[Chicano Movement]]\n* [[Chicano Moratorium]]\n* [[Chicano nationalism]]\n* [[Chicano rap]]\n* [[Cholo]]\n* [[Chileans]] (and [[Chilean American]])\n* [[La raza c\u00f3smica|Cosmic race]]\n* [[Hispanos]] (and [[Spanish American]])\n* [[Tejano]]\n* [[Ethnicity (United States Census)]]\n* [[Latino punk]]\n* [[List of Mexican Americans]]\n* [[Los Siete de la Raza]]\n* [[Mestizo]]\n** [[Mestizos in the United States]]\n* [[Mexican Americans]]\n* [[Murals]], i.e. [[Chicano Park]], [[San Diego]]\n* [[Pachuco]]\n* [[Pocho]]\n* [[Plaza de C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]]\n* [[Race (U.S. Census)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Rodolfo Acuna, ''Occupied America: A History of Chicanos'', Longman, 2006.\n* John R.

[[Gran Canaria]], with 865,070 inhabitants, is both the Canary Islands' second most populous island, and the third most populous one in Spain after [[Majorca]]. The island of [[Fuerteventura]] is the second largest in the archipelago and located {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} from the African coast.\n\nThe islands form the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]] with the [[Azores]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Madeira Islands|Madeira]], and the [[Savage Isles]]. The Canary Islands is the largest and most populated archipelago of the Macaronesia region.<ref name=\"catalogo.museosdetenerife.org\"/> The archipelago consists of seven large and several smaller islands, all of which are volcanic in origin.<ref>[http://www.mantleplumes.org/Canary.html (Universidad de Las Palmas,) Jos\u00e9 Mangas Vi\u00f1uela, \"The Canary Islands Hot Spot\"] This is the source for the geological history that follows.</ref>\n\nAccording to the position of the islands with respect to the north-east [[trade winds]], the climate can be mild and wet or very dry. Several native species form [[laurisilva]] forests.\n\nAs a consequence, the individual islands in the Canary archipelago tend to have distinct [[microclimate]]s. Those islands such as [[El Hierro]], [[La Palma]] and [[La Gomera]] lying to the west of the archipelago have a climate which is influenced by the moist [[Canary Current]]. They are well vegetated even at low levels and have extensive tracts of sub-tropical laurisilva forest. As one travels east toward the African coast, the influence of the current diminishes, and the islands become increasingly arid. [[Fuerteventura]] and [[Lanzarote]], the islands which are closest to the African mainland, are effectively desert or semi desert. [[Gran Canaria]] is known as a \"continent in miniature\" for its diverse landscapes like [[Maspalomas]] and [[Roque Nublo]]. In terms of its climate [[Tenerife]] is particularly interesting. The north of the island lies under the influence of the moist Atlantic winds and is well vegetated, while the south of the island around the tourist resorts of [[Playa de las Americas]] and [[Los Cristianos]] is arid. The island rises to almost {{convert|4000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, and at altitude, in the cool relatively wet climate, forests of the endemic pine ''[[Pinus canariensis]]'' thrive. Many of the plant species in the Canary Islands, like the Canary Island pine and the [[Dracaena (plant)|dragon tree]], ''[[Dracaena draco]]'' are endemic, as noted by [[Sabin Berthelot]] and [[Philip Barker Webb]] in their epic work, ''L'Histoire Naturelle des \u00celes Canaries'' (1835\u201350).\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe climate is [[subtropical]] and [[desert climate|desertic]], moderated by the sea and in summer by the [[trade winds]]. There are a number of [[microclimate]]s and the classifications range mainly from [[Hot semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[Desert climate|desert]].

From there, they went on to conquer Fuerteventura (1405) and El Hierro. B\u00e9thencourt received the title King of the Canary Islands, but still recognised King Henry III as his overlord.  It was not a simple military enterprise, given the aboriginal resistance on some islands. Neither was it politically, since the particular interests of the nobility (determined to strengthen their economic and political power through the acquisition of the islands) conflicted with those of the states, particularly Castile, which were in the midst of territorial expansion and in a process of strengthening of the Crown against the nobility.<ref>John Mercer, ''The Canary Islanders: their prehistory, conquest, and survival''  (1980).</ref>\n\nHistorians distinguish two periods in the conquest of the Canary Islands:\n\nAristocratic conquest (''Conquista se\u00f1orial''). This refers to the early conquests carried out by the nobility, for their own benefit and without the direct participation of the Crown of Castile, which merely granted rights of conquest in exchange for pacts of vassalage between the noble conqueror and the Crown. One can identify within this period an early phase known as the Betancurian or Norman Conquest, carried out by [[Jean de Bethencourt]] (who was originally from Normandy) and [[Gadifer de la Salle]] between 1402 and 1405, which involved the islands of [[Lanzarote]], [[El Hierro]] and [[Fuerteventura]]. The subsequent phase is known as the Castilian Conquest, carried out by Castilian nobles who acquired, through purchases, assignments and marriages, the previously conquered islands and also incorporated the island of [[La Gomera]] around 1450.\n\nRoyal conquest (''Conquista realenga''). This defines the conquest between 1478 and 1496, carried out directly by the Crown of Castile, during the reign of the [[Catholic Monarchs]], who armed and partly financed the conquest of those islands which were still to unconquered: [[Gran Canaria]], [[La Palma]] and [[Tenerife]]. This phase of the conquest came to an end in the year 1496, with the dominion of the island of Tenerife, bringing the entire Canarian Archipelago under the control of the Crown of Castile.\n\n[[File:Columbus House-Vegueta-Las Palmas Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Casa de Col\u00f3n (Las Palmas de Gran Canaria), which Christopher Columbus visited during his first trip.]]\nB\u00e9thencourt also established a base on the island of La Gomera, but it would be many years before the island was fully conquered. The natives of La Gomera, and of Gran Canaria, Tenerife, and La Palma, resisted the Castilian invaders for almost a century. In 1448 Maciot de B\u00e9thencourt sold the lordship of Lanzarote to Portugal's Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], an action that was accepted by neither the natives nor the Castilians. Despite [[Pope Nicholas V#cite ref-8|Pope Nicholas V]] ruling that the Canary Islands were under Portuguese control, the crisis swelled to a revolt which lasted until 1459 with the final expulsion of the Portuguese. In 1479, Portugal and Castile signed the [[Treaty of Alc\u00e1\u00e7ovas]], which settled disputes between Castile and Portugal over the control of the Atlantic. This treaty recognized Castilian control of the Canary Islands but also confirmed Portuguese possession of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], and the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde islands]], and gave the Portuguese rights to any further islands or lands in the Atlantic that might be discovered.\n\nThe Castilians continued to dominate the islands, but due to the topography and the resistance of the native Guanches, they did not achieve complete control until 1496, when Tenerife and La Palma were finally subdued by [[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]]. After that, the Canaries were incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Castile]].\n\n=== After the conquest ===\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Realm of Canary Islands.svg|thumb|upright=0.75|Coat of arms of the Castilian and Spanish Realm of Canary Islands]]\nAfter the conquest, the Castilians imposed a new economic model, based on single-crop cultivation: first [[sugarcane]]; then wine, an important item of trade with [[Kingdom of England|England]]. In this era, the first institutions of colonial government were founded. Gran Canaria, a colony of the [[Crown of Castile]] since 6 March 1480 (from 1556, of Spain), and Tenerife, a Spanish colony since 1495, each had its own governor.\n\nThe cities of [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] and [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] became a stopping point for the Spanish conquerors, traders, and missionaries on their way to the [[New World]]. This trade route brought great prosperity to some of the social sectors of the islands. The islands became quite wealthy and soon were attracting merchants and adventurers from all over Europe. Magnificent palaces and churches were built on La Palma during this busy, prosperous period. The Church of El Salvador survives as one of the island's finest examples of the architecture of the 16th century.\n\nThe Canaries' wealth invited attacks by [[pirate]]s and [[privateer]]s. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Turkish people|Turkish]] [[admiral]] and privateer [[Kemal Reis]] ventured into the Canaries in 1501, while [[Murat Reis the Elder]] captured Lanzarote in 1585.\n\nThe most severe attack took place in 1599, during the [[Dutch Revolt]]. A [[Dutch people|Dutch]] fleet of 74 ships and 12,000 men, commanded by [[Pieter van der Does]], attacked the capital Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (the city had 3,500 of Gran Canaria's 8,545 inhabitants). The Dutch attacked the Castillo de la Luz, which guarded the harbor. The Canarians evacuated civilians from the city, and the Castillo surrendered (but not the city). The Dutch moved inland, but Canarian cavalry drove them back to Tamaraceite, near the city.\n\nThe Dutch then laid siege to the city, demanding the surrender of all its wealth. They received 12 sheep and 3 calves. Furious, the Dutch sent 4,000 soldiers to attack the Council of the Canaries, who were sheltering in the village of Santa Br\u00edgida. 300 Canarian soldiers ambushed the Dutch in the village of Monte Lentiscal, killing 150 and forcing the rest to retreat. The Dutch concentrated on Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, attempting to burn it down. The Dutch pillaged [[Maspalomas]], on the southern coast of Gran Canaria, [[San Sebasti\u00e1n de La Gomera|San Sebasti\u00e1n]] on La Gomera, and [[Santa Cruz de La Palma|Santa Cruz]] on La Palma, but eventually gave up the siege of Las Palmas and withdrew.\n\nIn 1618 the [[Barbary pirates]] attacked Lanzarote and La Gomera taking 1000 captives to be sold as [[Barbary slave trade|slaves]].<ref>[[John Mercer (archaeologist)|John Mercer]] (1980), ''The Canary Islanders : their prehistory, conquest, and survival'', p. 236, Collings.</ref> Another noteworthy attack occurred in 1797, when [[Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (1797)|Santa Cruz de Tenerife]] was attacked by a British fleet under [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]] on 25 July. The British were repulsed, losing almost 400 men. It was during this battle that Nelson lost his right arm.\n\n=== 18th to 19th century ===\n[[File:Amaro Pargo.jpg|thumb|[[Amaro Pargo]] (1678\u20131741), [[Piracy|corsair]] and [[merchant]] from Tenerife who participated in the [[Spanish treasure fleet]] (the Spanish-American trade route).]]\nThe sugar-based economy of the islands faced stiff competition from Spain's American colonies. Low prices in the sugar market in the 19th century caused severe recessions on the islands. A new cash crop, [[cochineal]] (''cochinilla''), came into cultivation during this time, saving the islands' economy. During this time the Canarian-American trade was developed, in which Canarian products such as cochineal, sugarcane and rum are sold in American ports, such as [[Veracruz]], [[Campeche]], [[La Guaira]] and [[Havana]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canariascnnews.com/index.php/mirador/canarias/item/1721-el-comercio-canario-americano-en-el-siglo-xviii-i-parte|title=El comercio canario-americano en el siglo XVIII (I parte)|website=Canariascnnews.com}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, Canary Islanders had already emigrated to Spanish American territories, such as [[Havana]], [[Veracruz]], [[Santo Domingo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/j/m/jml34/Canary.htm |title= \"The Spanish of the Canary Islands\" |publisher=Personal.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> [[San Antonio, Texas]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/poc01 |title= \"Handbook of Texas Online \u2013 Canary Islanders\" |publisher=Tshaonline.org |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref> and [[St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.losislenos.org/ |title= \"Los Isle\u00f1os Heritage & Cultural Society website\" |publisher=Losislenos.org |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |title=\"Isle\u00f1os Society of St. Bernard Parish\" |publisher=Americaslibrary.gov |date= |accessdate=26 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007110753/http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/es/la/islenos_1 |archivedate=7 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These economic difficulties spurred mass emigration, primarily to the Americas, during the 19th and first half of the 20th century.

Deeply entrenched traditions, such as the Mascaras Festival in the town of [[Hatillo, Puerto Rico]], are an example of Canarian culture still preserved in Puerto Rico.

In this type of expedition, Sirera and Renn include the following travellers:\n* J. Edens, whose 1715 ascent and observations of Mt. Teide influenced many subsequent expeditions.\n* [[Louis Feuill\u00e9e]] (1724), who was sent to measure the meridian of El Hierro and to map the islands.\n* [[Jean-Charles de Borda]] (1771, 1776) who more accurately measured the longitudes of the islands and the height of Mount Teide\n* the [[Nicolas Baudin|Baudin]]-Ledru expedition (1796) which aimed to recover a valuable collection of natural history objects.\n\nThe second type of expedition identified by Sirera and Renn is one that took place starting from more or less private initiatives. Among these, the key exponents were the following:\n* [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1799)\n* [[Christian Leopold von Buch|Buch]] and [[Christen Smith (botanist)|Smith]] (1815)\n* [[Broussonet]]\n* [[Philip Barker Webb|Webb]]\n* [[Sabin Berthelot]].\n\nSirera and Renn identify the period 1770\u20131830 as one in which \"In a panorama dominated until that moment by France and England enters with strength and brio Germany of the Romantic period whose presence in the islands will increase\".\n\n=== Early 20th century ===\n[[File:Bahia luz las palmas 1912 jordao da luz perestello.jpg|thumb|The [[port of Las Palmas]] in 1912.]]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the British introduced a new [[cash-crop]], the [[banana]], the export of which was controlled by companies such as [[Fyffes]].\n\nThe rivalry between the elites of the cities of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Santa Cruz de Tenerife for the capital of the islands led to the division of the [[archipelago]] into two provinces in 1927. This has not laid to rest the rivalry between the two cities, which continues to this day.\n\nDuring the time of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], [[Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] workers' movements began to develop, led by figures such as Jose Miguel Perez and [[Guillermo Ascanio]]. However, outside of a few municipalities, these organisations were a minority and fell easily to Nationalist forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\n\n=== Franco regime ===\nIn 1936, [[Francisco Franco]] was appointed General Commandant of the Canaries. He joined the military revolt of 17 July which began the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Franco quickly took control of the archipelago, except for a few points of resistance on La Palma and in the town of [[Vallehermoso, Santa Cruz de Tenerife|Vallehermoso]], on La Gomera. Though there was never a war in the islands, the post-war suppression of political dissent on the Canaries was most severe.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Le\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez|first1=Aar\u00f3n|title=La represi\u00f3n franquista en Canarias: una guerra de 40 a\u00f1os|url=http://www.eldiario.es/canariasahora/sociedad/represion-franquista-Canarias-guerra-anos_0_379012266.html|website=canariasahora|publisher=eldiario.es|accessdate=18 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nDuring the Second World War, [[Winston Churchill]] prepared plans for the British seizure of the Canary Islands as a [[naval base]], in the event of [[Gibraltar]] being invaded from the Spanish mainland.\n\nOpposition to Franco's regime did not begin to organise until the late 1950s, which experienced an upheaval of parties such as the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] and the formation of various nationalist, leftist parties.\n\n=== Self-governance ===\n[[File:Auditorio de Tenerife Pano.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Auditorio de Tenerife]] by [[Santiago Calatrava]], and an icon of contemporary architecture in the Canary Islands, ([[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])]]\n[[File:EU OCT and OMR map en.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of the European Union in the world with overseas countries and territories and outermost regions]]\nAfter the death of Franco, there was a pro-independence armed movement based in [[Algeria]], the [[Canary Islands Independence Movement|Movement for the Independence and Self-determination of the Canaries Archipelago]] (MAIAC).

Both types can transport large numbers of passengers and cargo (including vehicles). Fast ferries are made of aluminium and powered by modern and efficient diesel engines, while conventional ferries have a steel hull and are powered by heavy oil. Fast ferries travel relatively quickly (in excess of 30 knots) and are a faster method of transportation than the conventional ferry (some 20 knots). A typical ferry ride between La Palma and Tenerife may take up to eight hours or more while a fast ferry takes about 2 and a half hours and between Tenerife and Gran Canaria can be about one hour.\n\nThe largest airport is the [[Gran Canaria Airport]].

But the rest of the islands of the archipelago have their carnivals with their own traditions among which stand out: The Festival of the Carneros of [[El Hierro]], the Festival of the Diabletes of [[Teguise (municipality)|Teguise]] in [[Lanzarote]], Los Indianos de [[La Palma]], the Carnival of [[San Sebasti\u00e1n de La Gomera]] and the Carnival of [[Puerto del Rosario]] in [[Fuerteventura]].\n\n== Sports ==\n[[File:RodriguezLopez2008.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Estadio Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez L\u00f3pez|Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez L\u00f3pez Stadium]] in Tenerife, the stadium with the largest area of field of the Canary Islands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vavel.com/es/futbol/cd-tenerife/515014-el-heliodoro-cumple-90-anos.html|title=El Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez L\u00f3pez cumple 90 a\u00f1os|first=Javier|last=Alonso|date=25 July 2015|website=Vavel.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lovecanarias.com/lugares/tenerife/estadio-heliodoro-rodriguez-lopez|title=Estadio Heliodoro Rodr\u00edguez L\u00f3pez|website=Lovecanarias.com}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Estadiogc7septiembre2008.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Estadio Gran Canaria|Gran Canaria Stadium]], the biggest sports venue of Canary Islands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/europe/countries/spain/canary_islands.shtml |title=Canary Islands Stadiums |publisher=WorldStadiums.com |date= |accessdate=1 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327220017/http://www.worldstadiums.com/europe/countries/spain/canary_islands.shtml |archivedate=27 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>]]\nA unique form of wrestling known as [[Canarian wrestling]] (''lucha canaria'') has opponents stand in a special area called a \"terrero\" and try to throw each other to the ground using strength and quick movements.<ref name=\"ctspanish.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ctspanish.com/communities/canarym/canary%20islands.htm |title=The Canary Islands |publisher=Ctspanish.com |date=21 October 1971 |accessdate=21 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nAnother sport is the \"game of the sticks\" where opponents fence with long sticks.

He continues to be an [[activism|activist]], publisher, lecturer, and producer. Addressing the negative views associated with rap music, he co-wrote the essay book ''Fight the Power: Rap, Race, and Reality'', along with Yusuf Jah. He argues that \"music and art and culture is escapism, and escapism sometimes is healthy for people to get away from reality\", but sometimes the distinction is blurred and that's when \"things could lead a young mind in a direction.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648327/chuck_d_the_d_is_for_dangerous.html |title=Chuck D: The D is for Dangerous |publisher=Crave Online |date=August 6, 2007 |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807110142/http://www.craveonline.com/music/articles/04648327/chuck_d_the_d_is_for_dangerous.html |archivedate=August 7, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref> He also founded the record company Slam Jamz and acted as narrator in Kareem Adouard's short film ''Bling: Consequences and Repercussions'', which examines the role of [[conflict diamonds]] in [[bling]] fashion. Despite Chuck D and Public Enemy's success, Chuck D claims that popularity or public approval was never a driving motivation behind their work. He is admittedly skeptical of celebrity status, revealing in a 1999 interview with [[BOMB Magazine]] that, \"The key for the record companies is to just keep making more and more stars, and make the ones who actually challenge our way of life irrelevant. The creation of celebrity has clouded the minds of most people in America, Europe and Asia. It gets people off the path they need to be on as individuals.\" <ref>Thorpe, David.

He believes that nothing has changed for African-Americans since the debut of Public Enemy and, although he thinks that an Obama-Clinton alliance is great, he does not feel that the establishment will allow anything of substance to be accomplished. He also stated that French President Sarkozy is like any other European elite: he has profited through the murder, rape, and pillaging of those less fortunate and he refuses to allow equal opportunity for those men and women from Africa. In this article, he also defended a comment made by [[Professor Griff]] in the past that he says was taken out of context by the media. The real statement was a critique of the Israeli government and its treatment of the Palestinian people. Chuck D stated that it is Public Enemy's belief that all human beings are equal.<ref name=\"monde\" />\n\nIn an interview with the magazine ''N'Digo'' published in late June 2008, he spoke of today's mainstream urban music seemingly relishing the addictive euphoria of materialism and sexism, perhaps being the primary cause of many people harboring resentment towards the genre and its future. However he has expressed hope for its resurrection, saying \"It's only going to be dead if it doesn't talk about the messages of life as much as the messages of death and non-movement\", citing artists such as [[NYOil]], [[M.I.A. (rapper)|M.I.A.]] and [[The Roots]] as socially conscious artists who push the envelope creatively. \"A lot of cats are out there doing it, on the Web and all over.

The interruption is usually quick, and is usually, although not always, ended by a return to the original scene. The effect is of commentary to the original scene, frequently comic in nature.\n\n==Usage==\nThe most common use of cutaway shots in dramatic films is to adjust the pace of the main action, to conceal the deletion of some unwanted part of the main shot, or to allow the joining of parts of two versions of that shot.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 'Grammar' of Television and Film|publisher=Aberystwyth University|date=|url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/gramtv.html|accessdate=31 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100406104908/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Documents/short/gramtv.html|archivedate=6 April 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For example, a scene may be improved by cutting a few [[Film frame|frames]] out of an actor's pause; a brief view of a listener can help conceal the break. Or the actor may fumble some of his lines in a group shot; rather than discarding a good version of the shot, the director may just have the actor repeat the lines for a new shot, and cut to that alternate view when necessary.\n\nCutaways are also used often in older horror films in place of special effects. For example, a shot of a zombie getting its head cut off may, for instance, start with a view of an axe being swung through the air, followed by a close-up of the actor swinging it, then followed by a cut back to the now severed head. [[George A. Romero]], creator of the [[Living Dead#Romero's Dead series|Dead Series]], and [[Tom Savini]] pioneered effects that removed the need for cutaways in horror films.<ref>{{cite web|title=George Romero Surveys the Dead|publisher=Parallax view|date=|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202150155/http://parallax-view.org:80/2008/10/29/george-romero-roams-the-land-of-the-dead/|accessdate=2008-12-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Savini biography|publisher=film reference|date=|url=http://www.filmreference.com/Writers-and-Production-Artists-Ro-She/Savini-Tom.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref> [[30 Rock]] would often use cutaway scenes to create visual humour, the Werewolf Bar Mitzvah scene taking three days to create for only five seconds of screen time.<ref>[https://www.indiewire.com/2013/01/watch-10-funny-30-rock-moments-to-commemorate-the-end-of-tina-feys-classic-sitcom-101973/]</ref> The animated television show ''[[Family Guy]]'' often uses cutaway gags as humor.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://observer.com/2017/06/seth-macfarlane-american-dad-family-guy/|title=Seth MacFarlane Outdoes Career-Starter \u2018Family Guy\u2019 With \u2018American Dad!\u2019|date=2017-06-07|work=Observer|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn [[news broadcasting]] and [[Documentary film|documentary work]], the cutaway is used much as it would be in fiction. On location, there is usually just one camera to film an interview, and it's usually trained on the interviewee. Often there is also only one microphone. After the interview, the interviewer will usually repeat his questions while he himself is being filmed, with pauses as they act as if to listen to the answers. These shots can be used as cutaways. Cutaways to the interviewer, called [[Noddy (TV interview technique)|noddies]], can also be used to cover cuts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Talk about Newsnight|publisher=The BBC|date=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/newsnight/2007/08/faking_it.html|accessdate=31 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\n* [[Buffer shot]]\n* [[Cross-cutting]]\n* [[Dissolve (filmmaking)]]\n* [[Fast cutting]]\n* [[Flashback (narrative)|Flashback]]\n{{col-break|gap=4em}}\n* [[Jump cut]]\n* [[L cut]]\n* [[Match cut]]\n* [[Shot reverse shot]]\n* [[Slow cutting]]\n* [[Cutscene]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Continuity Editing}}\n{{Cinematic techniques}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cutaway (Filmmaking)}}\n[[Category:Cinematography]]\n[[Category:Cinematic techniques]]\n[[Category:Film editing]]", "sha1": "sa6289i9ldgvfnrtcl0u4dcng6wi68r"}}, {"title": "Coma", "ns": "0", "id": "5721", "revision": {"id": "864992666", "parentid": "864732058", "timestamp": "2018-10-20T23:39:50Z", "contributor": {"username": "AmericanLemming", "id": "18175402"}, "comment": "adding a semicolon", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses|Coma (disambiguation)|Comas (disambiguation)}}\n{{Distinguish|Comma}}\n{{Infobox medical condition (new)\n| name            = Coma\n| field           = [[Neurology]], [[Psychiatry]]\n| symptoms        = \n| complications   = \n| onset           = \n| duration        = \n| types           = \n| causes          = \n| risks           = \n| diagnosis       = \n| differential    = \n| prevention      = \n| treatment       = \n| medication      = \n| prognosis       = \n| frequency       = \n| deaths          = \n}}\n'''Coma''' is a state of [[unconsciousness]] in which a person cannot be awakened; fails to respond normally to painful stimuli, light, or sound; lacks a normal wake-sleep cycle; and does not initiate voluntary actions.<ref name=RR>{{cite book |author1=Weyhenmyeye, James A. |author2=Eve A.

The cerebral cortex is a group of tight, dense, \"gray matter\" composed of the nuclei of the neurons whose axons then form the \"white matter,\" and is responsible for perception, relay of the sensory input via the thalamic pathway, and many other neurological functions, including complex thinking.\n\nRAS, on the other hand, is a more primitive structure in the [[brainstem]] which includes the [[reticular formation]] (RF).  The RAS area of the brain has two tracts, the ascending and descending tract.

It therefore could be a compensatory state in which the body's expenditure of energy is not superfluous.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The severity and mode of onset of coma depends on the underlying cause. For instance, severe [[hypoglycemia]] (low blood sugar) or [[hypercapnia]] (increased [[carbon dioxide]] levels in the blood) initially cause mild agitation and confusion, but progress to [[obtundation]], stupor, and finally, complete unconsciousness. In contrast, coma resulting from a severe [[traumatic brain injury]] or [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]] can be instantaneous. The mode of onset may therefore be indicative of the underlying cause.\n\n===Causes  of coma===\nComa may result from a variety of conditions, including [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] (such as drug abuse, overdose or misuse of over the counter medications, prescribed medication, or controlled substances), [[metabolism|metabolic]] abnormalities, central nervous system diseases, acute neurologic injuries such as [[stroke]]s or [[herniation]]s, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], [[hypothermia]], [[hypoglycemia]], [[eclampsia]] or traumatic injuries such as [[head trauma]] caused by falls, drowning accidents, or [[vehicle collision]]s. It may also be deliberately [[induced coma|induced]] by pharmaceutical agents during major [[neurosurgery]], to preserve higher brain functions following [[brain trauma]], or to save the patient from extreme pain during healing of injuries or diseases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Induced Coma|author=Benjamin Werdro| url=http://www.medicinenet.com/coma/page8.htm#induced}}</ref>\n\nForty percent of comatose states result from [[drug poisoning]].<ref name=\"Liversedge 2010 337\u2013339\">{{cite journal|first1=Timothy|last1=Liversedge|first2=Nicholas |last2=Hirsch|title=Coma|journal=Anaesthesia & Intensive Care Medicine|year=2010|pages=337\u2013339|doi=10.1016/j.mpaic.2010.05.008|volume=11|issue=9}}</ref> Drugs damage or weaken the synaptic functioning in the ARAS and keep the system from properly functioning to arouse the brain.<ref name=\"Young 2009 32\u201347\"/>  Secondary effects of drugs, which include abnormal heart rate and blood pressure, as well as abnormal breathing and sweating, may also indirectly harm the functioning of the ARAS and lead to a coma.

M.|title=Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury: Pathophysiology, neuropathology and mechanisms|journal=NeuroRehabilitation|year=2010|pages=5\u201313}}</ref> Lack of oxygen in the brain also causes [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] exhaustion and cellular breakdown from cytoskeleton damage and [[nitric oxide]] production.\n\nTwenty percent of comatose states result from the side effects of a stroke.<ref name=\"Liversedge 2010 337\u2013339\"/> During a stroke, blood flow to part of the brain is restricted or blocked. An ischemic stroke, brain hemorrhage, or tumor may cause such cessation of blood flow. Lack of blood to cells in the brain prevents oxygen from getting to the neurons, and consequently causes cells to become disrupted and eventually die. As brain cells die, brain tissue continues to deteriorate, which may affect functioning of the ARAS.\n\nThe remaining 15% of comatose cases result from trauma, excessive [[blood loss]], malnutrition, hypothermia, [[hyperthermia]], abnormal glucose levels, and many other biological disorders.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nDiagnosis of coma is simple, but diagnosing the cause of the underlying disease process is often challenging. The first priority in treatment of a comatose patient is stabilization following the basic ABCs (standing for airway, breathing, and circulation). Once a person in a coma is stable, investigations are performed to assess the underlying cause. Investigative methods are divided into [[physical examination]] findings and imaging (such as [[Cat scan|CAT scan]], [[Mri|MRI]], etc.) and special studies ([[EEG]], etc.)\n\n===Diagnostic steps===\nWhen an unconscious patient enters a hospital, the hospital utilizes a series of diagnostic steps to identify the cause of unconsciousness. According to Young,<ref name=\"Young 2009 32\u201347\"/> the following steps should be taken when dealing with a patient possibly in a coma:\n# Perform a general examination and medical history check\n# Make sure the patient is in an actual comatose state and or is not in locked-in state (patient is either able to voluntarily move their eyes or blink) or psychogenic unresponsiveness ([[Caloric reflex test|caloric stimulation of the vestibular apparatus]] results in slow deviation of eyes towards the stimulation followed by rapid correction to mid-line. This response cannot be voluntarily suppressed, so if the patient does not have this response, psychogenic coma can be ruled out.)\n# Find the site of the brain that may be causing coma (i.e., brain stem, back of brain\u2026) and assess the severity of the coma with the Glasgow coma scale\n# Take blood work to see if drugs were involved or if it was a result of hypoventilation/hyperventilation\n# Check for levels of \u201cserum glucose, calcium, sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, urea, and creatinine\u201d\n# Perform brain scans to observe any abnormal brain functioning using either CT or MRI scans\n# Continue to monitor brain waves and identify seizures of patient using EEGs\n\n===Initial assessment and evaluation===\nIn the initial assessment of coma, it is common to gauge the [[level of consciousness]] by spontaneously exhibited actions, response to vocal stimuli (\"Can you hear me?\"), and painful stimuli; this is known as the [[AVPU]] (alert, vocal stimuli, painful stimuli, unresponsive) scale. More elaborate scales, such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], quantify an individual's reactions such as eye opening, movement and verbal response on a scale; Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is an indication of the extent of brain injury varying from 3 (indicating severe brain injury and death) to a maximum of 15 (indicating mild or no brain injury).\n\nIn those with deep unconsciousness, there is a risk of [[asphyxiation]] as the control over the muscles in the face and throat is diminished. As a result, those presenting to a hospital with coma are typically assessed for this risk (\"[[airway management]]\"). If the risk of asphyxiation is deemed high, doctors may use various devices (such as an [[oropharyngeal airway]], [[nasopharyngeal airway]] or [[endotracheal tube]]) to safeguard the airway.\n\n===Physical examination findings===\n[[File:Decorticate.PNG|thumb|alt=Illustration of characteristic pose laying face-up, arms bent with knuckles held together at sternum, legs together and straight|[[Decorticate posturing]], indicating a [[lesion]] at the [[red nucleus]] or above. This positioning is stereotypical for upper [[brain stem]], or [[Cortex (anatomy)|cortical]] damage. The other variant is [[decerebrate posturing]], not seen in this picture.]]\n\nPhysical examination is critical after stabilization. It should include [[vital signs]], a general portion dedicated to making observations about the patient's [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] (breathing pattern), body movements (if any), and of the patient's [[body habitus]] (physique); it should also include assessment of the brainstem and cortical function through special reflex tests such as the [[oculocephalic reflex]] test (doll's eyes test), [[caloric reflex test|oculovestibular reflex]] test (cold caloric test), nasal tickle, [[corneal reflex]], and the [[gag reflex]].\n\nVital signs in medicine are temperature (rectal is most accurate), blood pressure, heart rate (pulse), respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation. It should be easy to evaluate these vitals quickly to gain insight into a patient's metabolism, fluid status, heart function, vascular integrity, and tissue oxygenation.\n\nRespiratory pattern (breathing rhythm) is significant and should be noted in a comatose patient. Certain stereotypical patterns of breathing have been identified including [[Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration|Cheyne\u2013Stokes]], a form of breathing in which the patient's breathing pattern is described as alternating episodes of [[hyperventilation]] and [[apnea]]. This is a dangerous pattern and is often seen in pending herniations, extensive cortical lesions, or brainstem damage.<ref name=med /> Another pattern of breathing is [[apneustic breathing]], which is characterized by sudden pauses of [[Inhalation]] and is due to a lesion of the [[pons]].<ref name=RR /><ref name=med /> [[Ataxic respiration|Ataxic breathing]] is irregular and is due to a lesion (damage) of the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]].\n\nAssessment of posture and body habitus is the next step. It involves general observation about the patient's positioning. There are often two stereotypical postures seen in comatose patients. [[Decorticate posturing]] is a stereotypical posturing in which the patient has arms [[Flexion|flexed]] at the elbow, and arms adducted toward the body, with both legs [[Extension (kinesiology)|extended]]. [[Decerebrate posturing]] is a stereotypical posturing in which the legs are similarly extended (stretched), but the arms are also stretched (extended at the elbow). The posturing is critical since it indicates where the damage is in the central nervous system. A decorticate posturing indicates a lesion (a point of damage) at or above the [[red nucleus]], whereas a decerebrate posturing indicates a lesion at or below the red nucleus. In other words, a decorticate lesion is closer to the cortex, as opposed to a decerebrate cortex that is closer to the brainstem.\n\n[[Oculocephalic reflex]] also known as the doll's eye is performed to assess the integrity of the brainstem. Patient's eyelids are gently elevated and the cornea is visualized. The patient's head is then moved to the patient's left, to observe if the eyes stay or deviate toward the patient's right; same maneuver is attempted on the opposite side. If the patient's eyes move in a direction opposite to the direction of the rotation of the head, then the patient is said to have an intact brainstem. However, failure of both eyes to move to one side, can indicate damage or destruction of the affected side. In special cases, where only one eye deviates and the other does not, this often indicates a lesion (or damage) of the [[medial longitudinal fasciculus]] (MLF), which is a brainstem nerve tract. [[Caloric reflex test]] also evaluates both cortical and brainstem function; cold water is injected into one ear and the patient is observed for eye movement; if the patient's eyes slowly deviate toward the ear where the water was injected, then the brainstem is intact, however failure to deviate toward the injected ear indicates damage of the brainstem on that side. Cortex is responsible for a rapid [[nystagmus]] away from this deviated position and is often seen in patients who are conscious or merely lethargic.\n\nAn important part of the physical exam is also assessment of the [[cranial nerves]]. Due to the unconscious status of the patient, only a limited number of the nerves can be assessed. These include the cranial nerves number 2 (CN II), number 3 (CN III), number 5 (CN V), number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerves 9 and 10 (CN IX, CN X). [[Gag reflex]] helps assess cranial nerves 9 and 10. Pupil reaction to light is important because it shows an intact retina, and cranial nerve number 2 (CN II); if pupils are reactive to light, then that also indicates that the cranial nerve number 3 (CN III) (or at least its [[parasympathetic]] fibers) are intact. [[Corneal reflex]] assess the integrity of cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII), and cranial nerve number 5 (CN V). Cranial nerve number 5 (CN V), and its ophthalmic branch (V<sub>1</sub>) are responsible for the afferent arm of the reflex, and the cranial nerve number 7 (CN VII) also known a facial nerve, is responsible for the efferent arm, causing contraction of the muscle [[orbicularis oculi]] resulting in closing of the eyes.\n\nPupil assessment is often a critical portion of a comatose examination, as it can give information as to the cause of the coma; the following table is a technical, medical guideline for common pupil findings and their possible interpretations:<ref name=med />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Pupil sizes (left eye vs. right eye) !! Possible interpretation\n\n|-\n| [[File:Darkblue.jpg|alt=Eyes open and pupils equal-dilation, normal size|250px]] || Normal eye with two pupils equal in size and reactive to light. This means that the patient is probably not in a coma and is probably lethargic, under influence of a drug, or sleeping.\n|-\n| [[File:Myosis due to opiate use.jpg|alt=Eyes open, pupils smaller than expected and equal|250px]] || \"Pinpoint\" pupils indicate [[heroin]] or opiate overdose, and can be responsible for a patient's coma. The pinpoint pupils are still reactive to light, [[wikt:bilateral|bilaterally]] (in both eyes, not just one). Another possibility is the damage of the pons.<ref name=med />\n|-\n| [[File:Anizokoria.JPG|alt=Eyes open, right pupil much larger than left|250px]] || One pupil is dilated and unreactive, while the other is normal (in this case, the right eye is dilated, while the left eye is normal in size). This could mean a damage to the [[oculomotor nerve]] (cranial nerve number 3, CN III) on the right side, or possibility of vascular involvement.\n|-\n| [[File:Cyclopentolate 1 percent Pupils.jpg|alt=Eyes open, both pupils widely dilated|250px]] || Both pupils are dilated and unreactive to light. This could be due to overdose of certain medications, [[hypothermia]] or severe [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]] (lack of oxygen).\n|}\n\n===Imaging and special tests findings===\nImaging basically encompasses [[computed tomography]] (CAT or CT) scan of the brain, or [[MRI]] for example, and is performed to identify specific causes of the coma, such as [[hemorrhage]] in the brain or [[herniation]] of the brain structures. Special tests such as an [[EEG]] can also show a lot about the activity level of the cortex such as semantic processing,<ref name=Daltrozzo01>{{cite journal |author1=Daltrozzo J. |author2=Wioland N. |author3=Mutschler V. |author4=Lutun P. |author5=Jaeger A. |author6=Calon B. |author7=Meyer A. |author8=Pottecher T. |author9=Lang S. |author10=Kotchoubey B. | year = 2009c | title = Cortical Information Processing in Coma | url = http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_et_al_%202009.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Cognitive & Behavioral Neurology | volume = 22 | issue = 1| pages = 53\u201362 | doi=10.1097/wnn.0b013e318192ccc8}}</ref> presence of [[seizures]], and are important available tools not only for the assessment of the cortical activity but also for predicting the likelihood of the patient's awakening.<ref name=Daltrozzo02>{{cite journal |author1=Daltrozzo J. |author2=Wioland N. |author3=Mutschler V. |author4=Kotchoubey B. | year = 2007 | title = Predicting Coma and other Low Responsive Patients Outcome using Event-Related Brain Potentials: A Meta-analysis | url = http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/daltrozzo_et_al_2007a.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 118 | issue = | pages = 606\u2013614 | doi=10.1016/j.clinph.2006.11.019}}</ref> The autonomous responses such as the [[skin conductance response]] may also provide further insight on the patient's emotional processing.<ref name=Daltrozzo03>{{cite journal |author1=Daltrozzo J. |author2=Wioland N. |author3=Mutschler V. |author4=Lutun P. |author5=Calon B. |author6=Meyer A. |author7=Jaeger A. |author8=Pottecher T. |author9=Kotchoubey B. | year = 2010a | title = Electrodermal Response in Coma and Other Low Responsive Patients | url = http://daltrozzo.net78.net/papers/Daltrozzo_et_al_2010b.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 475 | issue = 1| pages = 44\u201347 | doi=10.1016/j.neulet.2010.03.043 | pmid=20346390}}</ref>\n\n===History===\nWhen diagnosing any neurological condition, history and examination are fundamental.  History is obtained by family, friends or EMS.  The [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] is a helpful system used to examine and determine the depth of coma, track patients progress and predict outcome as best as possible. In general a correct diagnosis can be achieved by combining findings from physical exam, imaging, and history components and directs the appropriate therapy.\n\n===Severity and classification===\n{{Main|Coma scale}}\nA coma can be classified as (1) [[Tentorium cerebelli|supratentorial]] (above [[Tentorium cerebelli]]), (2) [[Tentorium cerebelli|infratentorial]] (below Tentorium cerebelli), (3) metabolic or (4) diffused.<ref name=med /> This classification is merely dependent on the position of the original damage that caused the coma, and does not correlate with severity or the prognosis.\nThe severity of coma impairment however is categorized into several levels. Patients may or may not progress through these levels. In the first level, the brain responsiveness lessens, normal reflexes are lost, the patient no longer responds to pain and cannot hear.\n\nThe [[Rancho Los Amigos Scale]] is a complex scale that has eight separate levels, and is often used in the first few weeks or months of coma while the patient is under closer observation, and when shifts between levels are more frequent.\n\n==Treatment==\n\n===Medical treatment===\nThe treatment hospitals use on comatose patients depends on both the severity and cause of the comatose state. Although the best treatment for comatose patients remains unknown, hospitals usually place comatose patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) immediately.<ref name=\"Young 2009 32\u201347\"/> Attention must first be directed to maintaining the patient's respiration and circulation, using intubation and ventilation, administration of intravenous fluids or blood and other supportive care as needed. Once a patient is stable and no longer in immediate danger, the medical staff may concentrate on maintaining the health of patient\u2019s physical state.  The concentration is directed to preventing infections such as pneumonias, bedsores ([[decubitus ulcers]]), and providing balanced nutrition.<ref name=sr /> Infections may appear from the patient not being able to move around, and being confined to the bed.  The nursing staff moves the patient every 2\u20133 hours from side to side and depending on the state of consciousness sometimes to a chair.  The goal is to move the patient as much as possible to try to avoid bedsores, [[atelectasis]] and pneumonia.  Pneumonia can occur from the person\u2019s inability to swallow leading to [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]], lack of gag reflex or from feeding tube, ([[aspiration pneumonia]]). Physical therapy may also be used to prevent [[contractures]] and orthopedic deformities that would limit recovery for those patients who awaken from coma.\n\nA person in a coma may become restless, or seize and need special care to prevent them from hurting themselves.  Medicine may be given to calm such individuals.  Patients who are restless may also try to pull on tubes or dressings so soft cloth wrist restraints may be put on.  Side rails on the bed should be kept up to prevent the patient from falling.<ref name=sr>{{cite web|title=Coma|url=http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/PatientEd/Materials/PDFDocs/dis-cond/general/coma.pdf|accessdate=2010-12-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627165642/http://medicalcenter.osu.edu/PatientEd/Materials/PDFDocs/dis-cond/general/coma.pdf|archivedate=2010-06-27|df=}}</ref>\n\nMethods to wake comatose patients include reversing the cause of the coma (e.g., glucose shock if low sugar), giving medication to stop brain swelling, or inducing hypothermia. Inducing hypothermia on comatose patients provides one of the main treatments for patients after suffering from cardiac arrest. In this treatment, medical personnel expose patients to \u201cexternal or intravascular cooling\u201d at 32-34&nbsp;\u00b0C for 24 hours; this treatment cools patients down about 2-3&nbsp;\u00b0C less than normal body temperature.<ref name=\"Baldursdottir 2010 821\u2013826\">{{cite journal|last=Baldursdottir|first=S.|author2=Sigvaldason, K. |author3=Karason, S. |author4=Valsson, F. |author5= Sigurdsson, G.

Common reactions, such as desperation, anger, frustration, and denial are possible. The focus of the patient care should be on creating an amicable relationship with the family members or dependents of a comatose patient as well as creating a rapport with the medical staff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Caring for Care Giver and Family|author=Coma Care|date=2010-03-30|accessdate=2010-12-08|url=http://www.comacare.com/cgi-bin/giga.cgi?}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==Prognosis==\nComas can last from several days to several weeks. In more severe cases a coma may last for over five weeks, while some have lasted as long as several years. After this time, some patients gradually come out of the coma, some progress to a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]], and others die. Some patients who have entered a vegetative state go on to regain a degree of awareness. Others remain in a vegetative state for years or even decades (the longest recorded period being 42 years).<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/11/22/3109800/edwarda-obara-who-spent-4-decades.html Edwarda O\u2019Bara, who spent 4 decades in a coma, dies at 59]\n</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-32776897 Aruna Shanba, who spent 42 years in coma.]</ref>\n\nThe outcome for coma and vegetative state depends on the cause, location, severity and extent of neurological damage. A deeper coma alone does not necessarily mean a slimmer chance of recovery, because some people in deep coma recover well while others in a so-called milder coma sometimes fail to improve.\n\nPeople may emerge from a coma with a combination of physical, intellectual, and psychological difficulties that need special attention. Recovery usually occurs gradually\u2014patients acquire more and more ability to respond.

This is unlike the situation in many movies where people who awake from comas are instantly able to continue their normal lives. In reality, the coma patient awakes sometimes in a profound state of confusion, not knowing how they got there and sometimes suffering from [[dysarthria]], the inability to articulate any speech, and with many other disabilities.\n\nPredicted chances of recovery are variable owing to different techniques used to measure the extent of neurological damage. All the predictions are based on [[statistical]] rates with some level of chance for recovery present: a person with a low chance of recovery may still awaken. Time is the best general predictor of a chance of recovery: after four months of coma caused by [[brain damage]], the chance of partial recovery is less than 15%, and the chance of full recovery is very low.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Formisano R |title=Clinical predictors and neuropleropsychological outcome in severe traumatic brain injury patients |journal=Acta Neurochir (Wien)|volume=146 |issue=5 |pages=457\u201362 |date=May 2004 |pmid=15118882 |doi=10.1007/s00701-004-0225-4 |url=|author2= Carlesimo GA |author3= Sabbadini M  |displayauthors=etal  }}</ref>\n\nThe most common cause of death for a person in a vegetative state is secondary [[infection]] such as [[pneumonia]], which can occur in patients who lie still for extended periods.\n\nThere are reports of patients coming out of coma after long periods of time.

The protagonists may also travel to places that are not of this earth, represented in the Dreamlands (which can be accessed through dreams as well as being physically connected to the earth), to other planets, or into the voids of space. In keeping with the Lovecraftian theme, the [[gamemaster]] is called the Keeper of Arcane Lore, or simply the keeper, while [[player character]]s are called \"investigators\".\n\n''CoC'' uses the [[Basic Role-Playing]] system first developed for ''[[RuneQuest]]'' and used in other Chaosium games. It is skill-based, with player characters getting better with their skills by succeeding at using them for as long as they stay functionally healthy and sane. They do not, however, gain hit points and do not become significantly harder to kill. The game does not use [[Experience point#Level-based progression|level]]s. \n\n''CoC'' uses percentile dice (with a results ranging from 1 to 100) to determine success or failure. Every player statistic is intended to be compatible with the notion that there is a probability of success for a particular action given what the player is capable of doing. For example, an artist may have a 75% chance of being able to draw something (represented by having 75 in Art skill), and thus rolling a number under 75 would yield a success. Rolling {{fract|1|5}} or less of the skill level (1-15 in the example) would be a \"special success\" (or an \"impale\" for combat skills) and would yield some extra bonus to be determined by the keeper. For example, the artist character might draw especially well or especially fast, or catch some unapparent detail in the drawing.\n\nThe players take the roles of ordinary people drawn into the realm of the mysterious: detectives, criminals, scholars, artists, war veterans, etc. Often, happenings begin innocently enough, until more and more of the workings behind the scenes are revealed. As the characters learn more of the true horrors of the world and the irrelevance of humanity, their sanity (represented by \"Sanity Points\", abbreviated SAN) inevitably withers away. The game includes a mechanism for determining how damaged a character's sanity is at any given point; encountering the horrific beings usually triggers a loss of SAN points. To gain the tools they need to defeat the horrors \u2013 mystic knowledge and magic \u2013 the characters may end up losing some of their sanity, though other means such as pure firepower or simply outsmarting one's opponents also exist. ''CoC'' has a reputation as a game in which it is quite common for a player character to die in gruesome circumstances or end up in a mental institution. Eventual triumph of the players is not assumed.\n\n==History==\nThe original conception of ''Call of Cthulhu'' was ''Dark Worlds'', a game commissioned by the publisher Chaosium but never published. [[Sandy Petersen]] contacted them regarding writing a supplement for their popular fantasy game ''[[RuneQuest]]'' set in Lovecraft's [[Dreamlands]]. He took over the writing of ''Call of Cthulhu'', and the game was released in 1981.<ref>{{cite journal| last =Turnbull| first =Don| authorlink = | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Call of Cthulhu| journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]| volume = | issue = 32| pages =18| publisher =[[Games Workshop]]|date=August 1982| issn = 0265-8712}}</ref>\n\n===Editions===\nSince Petersen's departure from Chaosium, continuing development of ''Call of Cthulhu'' passed to [[Lynn Willis]], credited as co-author in the fifth and sixth editions, and more recently to [[Paul Fricker]] and [[Mike Mason (game designer)|Mike Mason]].

Rather than the traditional format established by ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', which often involved the characters wandering through caves or tunnels and fighting different types of monsters, Sandy Petersen introduced the concept of the ''Onion Skin'': Interlocking layers of information and nested clues that lead the player characters from seemingly minor investigations into a missing person to discovering mind-numbingly awful, global conspiracies to destroy the world. Unlike its predecessor games, ''CoC'' assumed that most investigators would not survive, alive or sane, and that the only safe way to deal with the vast majority of nasty things described in the rule books was to run away. A well-run ''CoC'' campaign should engender a sense of foreboding and inevitable doom in its players. The style and setting of the game, in a relatively modern time period, created an emphasis on real-life settings, character research, and thinking one's way around trouble.\n\nThe first book of ''Call of Cthulhu'' adventures was ''Shadows of Yog-Sothoth''. In this work, the characters come upon a secret society's foul plot to destroy mankind, and pursue it first near to home and then in a series of exotic locations. This template was to be followed in many subsequent campaigns, including ''Fungi from Yuggoth'' (later known as ''Curse of Cthulhu'' and ''Day of the Beast''), ''Spawn of Azathoth'', and possibly the most highly acclaimed, ''Masks of Nyarlathotep''.<ref>{{cite journal  | last =Frances  | first =Phil  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Dungeon Modules  | format =  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 71  | pages =7\u20138  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=November 1985  | url =  | issn =0265-8712  | accessdate =  }}</ref> Many of these seem closer in tone to the pulp adventures of ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' than H. P. Lovecraft, but they are nonetheless beloved by many gamers.\n\n''Shadows of Yog-Sothoth'' is important not only because it represents the first published addition to the boxed first edition of ''Call of Cthulhu'', but because its format defined a new way of approaching a campaign of linked RPG scenarios involving actual clues for the would-be detectives amongst the players to follow and link in order to uncover the dastardly plots afoot. Its format has been used by every other campaign-length ''Call of Cthulhu'' publication. The standard of ''CoC'' scenarios was well received by independent reviewers. ''The Asylum and Other Tales'', a series of stand alone articles released in 1983, rated an overall 9/10 in Issue 47 of ''[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite journal  | last =Sutherland  | first =Jon  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title =Open Box: Dungeon Modules  | format =  | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]  | volume =  | issue = 47  | pages =14  | publisher =[[Games Workshop]]  |date=November 1983  | url =  | issn =0265-8712  | accessdate =  }}</ref>\n\nThe standard of the included 'clue' material varies from scenario to scenario, but reached its zenith in the original boxed versions of the ''Masks of Nyarlathotep'' and ''Horror on the Orient Express'' campaigns. Inside these one could find matchbooks and business cards apparently defaced by non-player characters, newspaper cuttings and (in the case of ''Orient Express'') period passports to which players could attach their photographs, increasing the sense of immersion. Indeed, during the period that these supplements were produced, third party campaign publishers strove to emulate the quality of the additional materials, often offering separately-priced 'deluxe' clue packages for their campaigns.\n\nAdditional milieux were provided by Chaosium with the release of ''Dreamlands'', a boxed supplement containing additional rules needed for playing within the Lovecraft Dreamlands, a large map and a scenario booklet, and ''Cthulhu By Gaslight'', another boxed set which moved the action from the 1920s to the 1890s.\n\n===Supplement campaigns===\n* ''Shadows of Yog-Sothoth'', 1982\n* ''Fungi from Yuggoth'', 1984\n* ''Masks of Nyarlathotep'', 1984\n* ''Spawn of Azathoth'', 1986\n\n===''Cthulhu Now''===\nIn 1987, Chaosium issued the supplement titled ''Cthulhu Now'', a collection of rules, supplemental source materials and scenarios for playing ''Call of Cthulhu'' in the present day. This proved to be a very popular alternative milieu, so much so that much of the supplemental material is now included in the core rule book.\n\n===''Delta Green''===\n{{main|Delta Green}}\n[[Pagan Publishing]] released ''Delta Green'', a series of supplements originally set in the 1990s, although later supplements add support for playing closer to the present day. In these, player characters are agents of a secret agency known as Delta Green, which fights against creatures from the Mythos and conspiracies related to them. [[Arc Dream Publishing]] released a new version of ''Delta Green'' in 2016 as a standalone game, partially using Call of Cthulhu's mechanics.\n\n===''Lovecraft Country''===\n{{Main|Lovecraft Country}}\n\n''Lovecraft Country'' was a line of supplements for ''Call of Cthulhu'' released in 1990. These supplements were overseen by [[Keith Herber]] and provided backgrounds and adventures set in Lovecraft's fictional towns of [[Arkham]], [[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]], [[Innsmouth]], [[Dunwich (Lovecraft)|Dunwich]], and their environs. The intent was to give investigators a common base, as well as to center the action on well-drawn characters with clear motivations.\n\n===Recent history===\nIn the years since the collapse of the ''Mythos'' collectible card game (production ceased in 1997), the release of ''CoC'' books has been very sporadic with up to a year between releases. Chaosium struggled with near bankruptcy for many years before finally starting their upward climb again.\n\n2005 was Chaosium's busiest year for many years with ten releases for the game. Chaosium took to marketing \"monographs\"\u2014short books by individual writers with editing and layout provided out-of-house\u2014directly to the consumer, allowing the company to gauge market response to possible new works. The range of times and places in which the horrors of the Mythos can be encountered was also expanded in late 2005 onwards with the addition of ''Cthulhu Dark Ages'' by St\u00e9phane Gesbert, which gives a framework for playing games set in 11th century Europe, ''Secrets of Japan'' by Michael Dziesinski for gaming in modern-day Japan, and ''Secrets of Kenya'' by [[David Conyers]] for gaming in interwar period Africa.\n\nIn July 2011, Chaosium announced it would re-release a 30th anniversary edition of the ''CoC'' 6th edition role-playing game.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chaosium.com/article.php?story_id=487|title=Taking Preorders: Call of Cthulhu 30th Anniversary Edition|work=Chaosium.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110730140218/http://www.chaosium.com/article.php?story_id=487|archivedate=July 30, 2011|df=}}</ref> This 320-page book features thick (3&nbsp;mm) leatherette hardcovers with the front cover and spine stamped with gold foil. The interior pages are printed in black ink, on 90 gsm matte art paper. The binding is thread sewn, square backed. Chaosium offered a one-time printing of this Collector's Edition.\n\nOn May 28, 2013, a [[crowdfunding]] campaign on [[Kickstarter]] for the 7th Edition of ''Call of Cthulhu'' was launched with a goal of $40,000; it ended on June 29 of the same year having collected $561,836.<ref>[http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/448333182/call-of-cthulhu-7th-edition]</ref> It included many more major revisions than any previous edition, and also split the core rules into two books, a Player's Guide and Keeper's Guide.<ref name=\"Inside Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition\" /><ref name=\"RPGGeek 7th Edition\" /> Problems and delays fulfilling the [[Kickstarter]]s for the 7th edition of ''Call of Cthulhu'' led Greg Stafford and Sandy Petersen (who had both left in 1998) to return to an active role at Chaosium in June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/448333182/call-of-cthulhu-7th-edition/posts/1251694|title=Call of Cthulhu 7th Edition|website=Kickstarter|accessdate=June 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Licenses==\nChaosium has licensed other publishers to create supplements using their rule system, notably including ''[[Delta Green]]'' by [[Pagan Publishing]].

Intended to preserve the feeling of the original game, the d20 conversion of the game rules were supposed to make the game more accessible to the large ''D&amp;D'' player base. The d20 system also made it possible to use ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' characters in ''Call of Cthulhu'', as well as to introduce the Cthulhu Mythos into ''Dungeons & Dragons'' games. The d20 version of the game is no longer supported by Wizards as per their contract with Chaosium.<ref>{{cite

marketed during the mid-1990s. While generally praised for its fast gameplay and unique mechanics, it ultimately failed to gain a very large market presence. It bears mention because its eventual failure brought the company to hard times that affected its ability to produce material for ''Call of Cthulhu''. ''Call of Cthulhu: The Card Game'' is a second collectible card game, produced by [[Fantasy Flight Games]].\n\n===Miniatures===\nThe first licensed ''Call of Cthulhu'' {{convert|25|mm|1|abbr=off|adj=mid}} gaming miniatures were sculpted by Andrew Chernack and released by Grenadier Models in boxed sets and blister packs in 1983. The license was later transferred to RAFM. As of 2011, RAFM still produce licensed C''all of Cthulhu'' models sculpted by Bob Murch. Both lines include investigator player character models and the iconic monsters of the Cthulhu mythos.\nAs of July 2015, Reaper Miniatures started its third \"[https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1513061270/reaper-miniatures-bones-3-the-search-for-mr-bones Bones Kickstarter]\", a Kickstarter intended to help the company migrate some miniatures from metal to plastic, and introducing some new ones. Among the stretch goals was the second $50 expansion, devoted to the Mythos, with miniatures such as Cultists, Deep Ones, Mi'Go, and an extra $15 Shub-Niggurath \"miniature\" (it is, at least, 6x4 squares). It is expected for those miniatures to remain in the Reaper Miniatures catalogue after the Kickstarter project finishes.\n\n==Reception==\nWilliam A. Barton reviewed ''Call of Cthulhu'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 49.<ref name=\"SG\">{{cite journal|last=Barton |first=William A. |date=March 1982 |title=Featured Review: Call of Cthulhu|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=49|pages=4-7}}</ref> Barton calls the game \"an excellent piece of work.\" He noted that there were some shortcomings resulting from assumption of rules details from ''RuneQuest'' that are not in ''CoC'' itself, but praised it overall, saying \"the worlds of H. P. Lovecraft are truly open for the fantasy gamer., and calling the game a satisfactory experience.<ref name=\"SG\"/>\n\n''Call of Cthulhu'' was ranked 1st in the 1996 reader poll of ''Arcane'' magazine to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time.  The UK magazine's editor Paul Pettengale commented: \"''Call of Cthulhu'' is fully deserved of the title as the most popular roleplaying system ever - it's a game that doesn't age, is eminently playable, and which hangs together perfectly.

Although the island is physically separated from the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]] by the [[Strait of Canso]], the {{convert|1385|m|ft|abbr=on}} long rock-fill [[Canso Causeway]] connects it to mainland Nova Scotia. The island is east-northeast of the mainland with its northern and western [[coast]]s fronting on the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]; its western coast also forms the eastern limits of the [[Northumberland Strait]]. The eastern and southern coasts front the Atlantic Ocean; its eastern coast also forms the western limits of the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its landmass slopes upward from south to north, culminating in the [[highland]]s of its northern cape. One of the world's larger salt water lakes, {{lang|fr|[[Bras d'Or Lake|Bras d'Or]]}} (\"Arm of Gold\" in French), dominates the island's centre.\n\nThe island is divided into four of Nova Scotia's eighteen counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]]. Their total population at the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]] numbered 132,010 \"Cape Bretoners\"; this is approximately 15% of the provincial population.<ref name=\"Table from Statistics Canada\"/> Cape Breton Island has experienced a decline in population of approximately 2.9% since the 2011 census. Approximately 75% of the island's population is in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] (CBRM) which includes all of Cape Breton County and is often referred to as [[Industrial Cape Breton]], given the history of coal mining and steel manufacturing in this area, which was Nova Scotia's industrial heartland throughout the 20th century.\n\nThe island has five [[Indian reserve|reserves]] of the [[Mi'kmaq|Mi'kmaq Nation]]: {{lang|mic|[[Eskasoni First Nation|Eskasoni]]}}, {{lang|mic|[[Membertou First Nation|Membertou]]}}, {{lang|mic|[[Wagmatcook First Nation|Wagmatcook]]}}, {{lang|mic|[[Whycocomagh 2|Waycobah]]}}, and [[Potlotek First Nation|{{lang|mic|Potlotek|nocat=y}}/Chapel Island]]. {{lang|mic|Eskasoni}} is the largest in both population and land area.\n\n==Toponymy==\nIts name may derive from {{lang|fr|[[Capbreton]]}} near [[Bayonne]], or more probably from ''[[Cape (geography)|Cape]]'' and the word ''{{lang|fr|Breton}}'', the French [[demonym]] for ''{{lang|fr|[[Brittany|Bretagne]]}}'', the French historical region.<ref name=\"EB1911\">{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Cape Breton}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nCape Breton Island's first residents were likely [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic maritime natives]], ancestors of the [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]]. These peoples and their progeny inhabited the island (known as Unama'ki) for several thousand years and continue to live there to this day. Their traditional lifestyle centred around hunting and fishing because of the unfavourable agricultural conditions of their maritime home. This ocean-centric lifestyle did, however, make them among the first indigenous peoples to discover European explorers and sailors fishing in the St Lawrence Estuary. [[John Cabot]] reportedly visited the island in 1497.<ref name=EB1911/> However, European histories and maps of the period are of too poor quality to be sure whether Cabot first visited [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] or Cape Breton Island. This discovery is commemorated by Cape Breton's [[Cabot Trail]], and by the Cabot's Landing Historic Site & Provincial Park, near the village of [[Dingwall, Nova Scotia|Dingwall]].\n\nThe local Mi'kmaq peoples began trading with European fishermen when the fishermen began landing in their territories as early as the 1520s. In about 1521\u201322, the Portuguese under [[Jo\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Fagundes]] established a fishing colony on the island. As many as two hundred settlers lived in a village, the name of which is not known, located according to some historians at what is now [[Ingonish, Nova Scotia|Ingonish]] on the island's northeastern peninsula. These fishermen traded with the local population but did not maintain a permanent settlement. This Portuguese colony's fate is unknown, but it is mentioned as late as 1570.<ref>de Souza, Francisco; ''Tratado das Ilhas Novas'', 1570</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Anglo-French War (1627\u201329)|Anglo-French War]] of 1627 to 1629, under [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], the [[David Kirke|Kirkes]] took [[Quebec City]]; [[James Stewart, 4th Lord Ochiltree|Sir James Stewart]]<ref name=EB1911/> of Killeith, [[Lord Ochiltree]] planted a colony on Unama'ki at [[Baleine, Nova Scotia]]; and Alexander's son, [[William Alexander, 1st Earl of Stirling]], established the first incarnation of [[Nova Scotia|\"New Scotland\"]] at [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]]. These claims, and larger European ideals of native conquest were the first time the island was incorporated as European territory, though it would be several decades later that treaties would actually be signed (no copies of these treaties exist).\n\nThese Scottish triumphs, which left [[Cape Sable Island|Cape Sable]] as the only major French holding in North America, did not last.<ref>Roger Sarty and Doug Knight.

These settlements lasted only one generation, until [[Nicolas Denys]] left in 1659. The island did not have any European settlers for another fifty years before those communities along with [[Louisbourg (community)|Louisbourg]] were re-established in 1713, after which point European settlement was permanently established on the island.\n\n===\u00cele Royale===\n[[File:Flag of the Kingdom of France (1814-1830).svg|thumb|100px|French Naval Ensign (pure white) flown over the Colony of \u00cele Royale]]\n\nKnown as \"''\u00cele Royale''\" (\"Royal Island\") to the French, the island also saw active settlement by France. After the French ceded their claims to [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the [[Acadia]]n mainland to the British by the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713, the French relocated the population of [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Plaisance, Newfoundland]], to [[\u00cele-Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]] and the French [[garrison]] was established in the central eastern part at [[Fort Sainte Anne (Nova Scotia)|Sainte Anne]]. As the harbour at Sainte Anne experienced icing problems, it was decided to build a much larger fortification at [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] to improve defences at the entrance to the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]] and to defend France's fishing fleet on the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]].<ref>[http://www.cmhg.gc.ca/cmh/en/page_103.asp ''Canadian Military Heritage'']; vol.1, Chapter 6: Soldiers of the Atlantic Seaboard, p103.

In addition to Cape Breton Island, the French colony of \u00cele Royale also included [[Prince Edward Island|\u00cele Saint-Jean]], today called [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Les \u00celes-de-la-Madeleine]].\n\n[[File:Destruction du vaisseau le Prudent et capture du Bienfaisant a Louisbourg 1758.jpg|300px|thumb|right|[[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]]]]\n\n==== French and Indian War ====\nLouisbourg itself was one of the most important commercial and military centres in New France.  Louisbourg was captured by New Englanders<ref name=EB1911/> with British naval assistance in [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|1745]]<ref name=\"timeline\" /> and by British forces in 1758. The French population of \u00cele Royale was deported to France after each siege.

It was then merged with the adjacent, British colony of Nova Scotia (present day peninsular Nova Scotia and [[New Brunswick]]). Acadians who had been [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from [[Nova Scotia]] and \u00cele Royale were permitted to settle in Cape Breton beginning in 1764,<ref name=\"timeline\" /> and established communities in north-western Cape Breton, near [[Cheticamp]], and southern Cape Breton, on and near [[Isle Madame]].\n\nSome of the first British-sanctioned settlers on the island following the [[Seven Years' War]] were Irish, although upon settlement they merged with local French communities to form a culture rich in music and tradition.  From 1763 to 1784, the island was administratively part of the colony of [[Nova Scotia]]<ref name=EB1911/> and was governed from [[Halifax (former city)|Halifax]].\n\nThe first permanently settled [[Scottish people|Scottish]] community on Cape Breton Island was [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]], settled in 1775 by Michael Mor MacDonald. He spent his first winter using his upside-down boat for shelter, which is reflected in the architecture of the village's Community Centre. He composed a song about the area called \"O 's \u00e0lainn an t-\u00e0ite\", or \"O, Fair is the Place.\"\n\n==== American Revolution ====\n[[File:The Departure of S.W.

Although winter conditions prevented the freeing of the prisoners, the mission did result in the capture of ''Mellish'', a vessel carrying a vital supply of winter clothing intended for [[John Burgoyne]]'s troops in Canada.\n\nMajor [[Timothy Hierlihy]] and his regiment on board HMS ''Hope'' worked in and protected from privateer attacks on the coal mines at Sydney Cape Breton.<ref>C.

Akins. (1895) History of Halifax. Dartmouth: Brook House Press.p. 82</ref> French ships (fighting with the Americans) were re-coaling and defeated a British convoy. Six French sailors were killed and 17 British, with many more wounded.\n\n===Colony of Cape Breton===\n[[File:Red Ensign of Great Britain (1707-1800).svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1784\u20131801.]]\n[[File:Civil Ensign of the United Kingdom.svg|thumb|100px|Flag of the Colony of Cape Breton 1801\u20131820.]]\nIn 1784, Britain split the colony of Nova Scotia into three separate colonies:  New Brunswick, Cape Breton Island, and present-day peninsular Nova Scotia, in addition to the adjacent colonies of [[Prince Edward Island|St. John's Island]] (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1798) and [[History of Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]].  The colony of Cape Breton Island had its capital at [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]] on its namesake harbour fronting on [[Spanish Bay (Nova Scotia)|Spanish Bay]] and the [[Cabot Strait]]. Its first Lieutenant-Governor was [[Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres]] (1784\u20131787) and his successor was [[William Macarmick]] (1787).\n\nA number of [[United Empire Loyalists]] emigrated to the Canadian colonies, including Cape Breton. [[David Mathews]], the former [[Mayor of New York City]] during the [[American Revolution]], emigrated with his family to Cape Breton in 1783.  He succeeded Macarmick as head of the colony and served from 1795 to 1798.<ref>{{cite DCB |title=Mathews, David |first=R. J. |last=Morgan |volume=IV |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/mathews_david_4E.html}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1799 to 1807, the military commandant was [[John Despard]],<ref>{{cite DCB |title=Despard, John |first=R. J. |last=Morgan |volume=6 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/despard_john_6E.html}}</ref> brother of [[Edward Despard|Edward]].<ref>Despard, John; ''The Companion to British History'', Routledge</ref>\n\nAn order forbidding the granting of land in Cape Breton, issued in 1763, was removed in 1784. The mineral rights to the island were given over to the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] by an order-in-council. The British government had intended that the Crown take over the operation of the mines when Cape Breton was made a colony, but this was never done, probably because of the rehabilitation cost of the mines. The mines were in a neglected state, caused by careless operations dating back at least to the time of the final fall of Louisbourg in 1758.\n\nLarge-scale shipbuilding began in the 1790s, beginning with [[schooner]]s for local trade moving in the 1820s to larger [[brig]]s and [[brigantine]]s, mostly built for British shipowners. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1850s, marked in 1851 by the [[full-rigged ship]] ''[[Lord Clarendon (ship)|Lord Clarendon]]'', the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton.\n\n===Merger with Nova Scotia===\n\nIn 1820, the colony of Cape Breton Island was merged for the second time with Nova Scotia.  This development is one of the factors which led to large-scale industrial development in the Sydney Coal Field of eastern Cape Breton County. By the late 19th century, as a result of the faster shipping, expanding fishery and industrialization of the island, exchanges of people between the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and Cape Breton increased, beginning a cultural exchange that continues to this day.\n\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, Cape Breton Island experienced an influx of [[Highland Scots]] numbering approximately 50,000 as a result of the [[Highland Clearances]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/1211615-great-scots-the-past-comes-to-life-at-highland-village-museum|title=Great Scots: The past comes to life at Highland Village Museum|date=2014-06-01|work=The Chronicle Herald|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cabotshores.com/history-of-cape-breton-island-272|title=History of Cape Breton Island|date=2010-02-08|work=The Cabot Trail's Wilderness Resort on Cape Breton Island|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}</ref> Today, the descendants of the Highland Scots dominate Cape Breton Island's culture, particularly in rural communities.

Many of the Scots who immigrated there were either Roman Catholics or Presbyterians, which can be seen in a number of island landmarks and place names.\n\nThe 1920s were some of the most violent times in Cape Breton. They were marked by several severe labour disputes.  The famous murder of [[William Davis (miner)|William Davis]] by strike breakers, and the seizing of the [[New Waterford, Nova Scotia|New Waterford]] power plant by striking miners led to a major union sentiment that persists to this day in some circles. [[William Davis Miners' Memorial Day]] is celebrated in coal mining towns to commemorate the deaths of miners at the hands of the coal companies.\n\n===20th century===\n\nThe turn of the 20th century saw Cape Breton Island at the forefront of scientific achievement with the now-famous activities launched by inventors [[Alexander Graham Bell]] and [[Guglielmo Marconi]].\n\nFollowing his successful invention of the telephone and being relatively wealthy, Bell acquired land near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia|Baddeck]] in 1885, largely due to surroundings reminiscent of his early years in [[Scotland]]. He established a summer estate complete with research laboratories, working with deaf people\u2014including [[Helen Keller]]\u2014and continued to invent. Baddeck would be the site of his experiments with [[hydrofoil]] technologies as well as the [[Aerial Experiment Association]], financed by his wife, which saw the first powered flight in the [[British Empire]] when the [[AEA Silver Dart|AEA ''Silver Dart'']] took off from the ice-covered waters of [[Bras d'Or Lake]]. Bell also built the forerunner to the [[Negative pressure ventilator|iron lung]] and experimented with breeding sheep.\n\nMarconi's contributions to Cape Breton Island were also quite significant, as he used the island's geography to his advantage in transmitting the first North American trans-[[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] radio message from a station constructed at Table Head in [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]] to a receiving station at [[Poldhu]] in Cornwall, England. Marconi's pioneering work in Cape Breton marked the beginning of modern radio technology. Marconi's station at Marconi Towers, on the outskirts of Glace Bay, became the chief communication centre for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] in World War I through to the early years of World War II.\n\nDuring World War II, there was a significant drop of Gaelic speakers due to a prejudice caused by Ireland's neutrality during the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gaelic.novascotia.ca/sites/default/files/files/Gaelic-Report.pdf|title=Gaelic-Report|last=Kennedy|first=Michael|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPromotions for tourism beginning in the 1950s recognized the importance of the Scottish culture to the province, and the provincial government started encouraging the use of Gaelic once again. The establishment of funding for the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]] and formal Gaelic [[language courses]] in public schools are intended to address the near-loss of this culture to English [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].\n \nIn the 1960s, the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]] was partially reconstructed by [[Parks Canada]]. Since 2009, this [[National Historic Site of Canada]] has attracted an average of 90&nbsp;000 visitors per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.krausehouse.ca/krause/FortressOfLouisbourgVisitationNumbers.htm |title=Fortress of Louisbourg Visitation Numbers |last1=Krause |first1=Eric R.|date=30 July 2014|publisher=Krause House Info-Research Solutions |accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2016, Cape Breton Island humorously announced that any American \"refugees\" fleeing their nation if [[Donald Trump]] (or possibly [[Hillary Clinton]]) won the presidential election would be welcomed to Cape Breton, with the only requirement being that the newcomers possess Canadian citizenship.<ref name=\"cbiftrumpwins.com\">Cape Breton if Donald Trump Wins, via http://cbiftrumpwins.com/#intro</ref> In their website's FAQ, they state they are doing this both to help American \"refugees\" and because \"...our population is shrinking. A slow economy, in combination with out-migration has us on an unsustainable path. The truth is we welcome all, no matter the ideology. We have a beautiful island, a friendly people, a rich culture and a bright future...\". As of 9 November 2016, the day following [[United States presidential election, 2016|Election Day]], as well as Trump's victory, the offer still stands.<ref name=\"cbiftrumpwins.com\"/>\n\n==Environment==\n\n===Geography===\n[[File:Sydney, Nova Scotia.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Sydney waterfront, focal point of the largest population centre on Cape Breton Island.]]\nThe island measures {{convert|10311|km2|0}} in area, making it the [[List of islands by area|77th largest island in the world]] and [[List of Canadian islands by area|Canada's 18th largest island]]. Cape Breton Island is composed mainly of rocky shores, rolling farmland, glacial valleys, barren headlands, mountains, woods and plateaus. Geological evidence suggests at least part of the island was joined with present-day Scotland and Norway, now separated by millions of years of [[plate tectonics]].\n\nCape Breton Island's northern portion is dominated by the [[Cape Breton Highlands]], commonly shortened to simply the \"Highlands\", which are an extension of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian mountain chain]]. The Highlands comprise the northern portions of [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]] and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria counties]]. In 1936, the federal government established the [[Cape Breton Highlands National Park]] covering {{convert|949|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} across the northern third of the Highlands. The [[Cabot Trail]] scenic highway also encircles the plateau's coastal perimeter.\n[[File:Sydney, Cape Breton waterfront buildings.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Sydney is home to City Hall (right) as well as apartment complexes and hotels]]\nCape Breton Island's hydrological features include the [[Bras d'Or Lake]] system, a salt-water [[fjord]] at the heart of the island, and [[freshwater]] features including [[Lake Ainslie]], the [[Margaree River]] system, and the [[Mira River (Nova Scotia)|Mira River]]. Innumerable smaller rivers and streams drain into the Bras d'Or Lake [[estuary]] and on to the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Atlantic coasts.\n\nCape Breton Island is joined to the mainland by the [[Canso Causeway]], which was completed in 1955, enabling direct road and rail traffic to and from the island, but requiring [[marine traffic]] to pass through the [[Canso Canal]] at the eastern end of the [[causeway]].\n\nCape Breton Island is divided into four counties: [[Cape Breton County, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness]], [[Richmond County, Nova Scotia|Richmond]], and [[Victoria County, Nova Scotia|Victoria]].\n\nThe climate is one of mild, often pleasantly warm summers and cold winters, although the proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and [[Gulf Stream]] moderates the extreme winter cold found on the mainland, especially on the east side that faces the Atlantic. Precipitation is abundant year round, with annual totals up to 60 inches on the eastern side facing the Atlantic storms. Considerable snowfall occurs in winter, especially in the highlands.\n\n===Wildlife===\n{{see also|Cape Breton Highlands National Park}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Glace Bay Shul, August 2012.jpg|thumb|200px|The former Congregation Sons of Israel synagogue, in Glace Bay. In 1902, the synagogue was Nova Scotia's first purpose built synagogue. It permanently closed in July 2010. To the left is the also closed Talmud Torah community centre. This was the location of the Hebrew school and functions like Bar Mitzvah and wedding dinners.]]\n\nThe island's residents can be grouped into five main cultures: [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[Mi'kmaq people|Mi'kmaq]], [[Acadian]], Irish, English, with respective languages [[Scottish Gaelic]], [[M\u00edkmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], [[Acadian French|French]], and English. English is now the primary language, including a locally distinctive [[Cape Breton accent]], while Mi'kmaq, Scottish Gaelic and Acadian French are still spoken in some communities.\n\nLater migrations of [[Black Loyalist]]s, Italians, and Eastern Europeans mostly settled in the island's eastern part around the industrial Cape Breton region. Cape Breton Island's population has been in decline two decades with an increasing exodus in recent years due to economic conditions.\n\nAccording to the Census of Canada, the population of Cape Breton [Economic region] in 2016 / 2011 / 2006 / 1996 was 132,010 / 135,974 / 142,298 / 158,260.\n\n'''Religious groups'''\n\n[[Canada 2001 Census|Statistics Canada]] in 2001 reported a \"religion\" total of 145,525 for Cape Breton, including 5,245 with \"no religious affiliation.\"<ref>''[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=1217&Geo2=CD&Code2=1216&Data=Count&SearchText=Cape%20Breton%20County&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= Table from Statistics Canada \u2013 Cape Breton & Richmond Counties]'' (Nova Scotia Statistics Agency)</ref><ref>''[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/profil01/CP01/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CD&Code1=1218&Geo2=CD&Code2=1215&Data=Count&SearchText=Cape%20Breton%20County&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&Custom= Table from Statistics Canada \u2013 Victoria & Inverness Counties]'' (Nova Scotia Statistics Agency)</ref> Major categories included:\n* [[Roman Catholic]] : 96,260 (includes Eastern Catholic, Polish National Catholic Church, Old Catholic)\n* [[Protestant]]: 42,390\n* Christian, not included elsewhere: 580\n* [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]: 395\n* [[Jewish]]: 250\n* [[Muslim]]: 145\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Cape Breton Flag - Popular.jpg|thumb|100px|Cape Breton Island's most recognizable and commonly used flag.]]\n[[File:Cape Breton Island flag 1997.png|thumb|100px|Cape Breton Island's \"Eagle\" flag (1994).<ref>[http://www.capebretonpost.com/Football/2009-11-23/article-774026/Woman-wants-Cape-Breton-flag-designed-by-her-daughter-recognized/1 Woman wants Cape Breton flag designed by her daughter recognized \u2013 Football].

It is the island's largest commercial centre and home to the ''[[Cape Breton Post]]'' daily newspaper, as well as one television station, [[CJCB-TV]] (CTV),{{refn|group=\"Note\"|[[CBIT-TV]] (CBC) existed from 1972 until 31 July 2012, when the CBC closed its over-the-air analog transmitters in small markets.

The [[Marine Atlantic]] terminal at [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]] is the terminal for large ferries traveling to [[Channel-Port aux Basques]] and seasonally to [[Argentia]], both on the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].\n\n[[Point Edward, Nova Scotia|Point Edward]] on the west side of Sydney Harbour is the location of Sydport, a former [[Royal Canadian Navy|navy]] base ({{HMCS|Protector}}) now converted to commercial use. The [[Canadian Coast Guard College]] is nearby at Westmount. Petroleum, bulk coal, and cruise ship facilities are also in Sydney Harbour.\n\n[[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia|Glace Bay]], the second largest urban community in population, was the island's main coal mining centre until its last mine closed in the 1980s. Glace Bay was the hub of the Sydney & Louisburg Railway and a major fishing port. At one time, Glace Bay was known as the largest town in Nova Scotia, based on population.\n\n[[Port Hawkesbury]] has risen to prominence since the completion of the Canso Causeway and [[Canso Canal]] created an artificial deep-water port, allowing extensive petrochemical, pulp and paper, and gypsum handling facilities to be established. The Strait of Canso is completely navigable to [[Seawaymax]] vessels, and Port Hawkesbury is open to the deepest-draught vessels on the world's oceans. Large marine vessels may also enter Bras d'Or Lake through the Great Bras d'Or channel, and small craft can use the Little Bras d'Or channel or [[St. Peters Canal]]. While commercial shipping no longer uses the St. Peters Canal, it remains an important waterway for recreational vessels.\n\nThe industrial Cape Breton area faced several challenges with the closure of the [[Cape Breton Development Corporation]]'s (DEVCO) coal mines and the [[Sydney Steel Corporation]]'s (SYSCO) [[steel mill]]. In recent years, the Island's residents have tried to diversify the area economy by investing in tourism developments, [[call centre]]s, and small businesses, as well as manufacturing ventures in fields such as auto parts, pharmaceuticals, and window glazings.\n\nWhile the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]] is in transition from an industrial to a service-based economy, the rest of Cape Breton Island outside the industrial area surrounding Sydney-Glace Bay has been more stable, with a mixture of fishing, forestry, small-scale agriculture, and tourism.\n\nTourism in particular has grown throughout the post-[[Second World War]] era, especially the growth in vehicle-based touring, which was furthered by the creation of the [[Cabot Trail]] scenic drive.  The scenery of the island is rivalled in northeastern North America by only [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]];{{Citation needed|reason=Subjective?|date=September 2013}} and Cape Breton Island tourism marketing places a heavy emphasis on its Scottish [[Gaels|Gaelic]] heritage through events such as the Celtic Colours Festival, held each October, as well as promotions through the [[Gaelic College of Celtic Arts and Crafts]].\n\nWhale-watching is a popular attraction for tourists. Whale-watching cruises are operated by vendors from Baddeck to Cheticamp. The most popular species of whale found in Cape Breton's waters is the [[Pilot whale]].\n\nThe island's primary east-west road is [[Nova Scotia Highway 105|Highway 105]], the [[Trans-Canada Highway]], although [[Nova Scotia Trunk 4|Trunk 4]] is also heavily used. [[Nova Scotia Highway 125|Highway 125]] is an important arterial route around Sydney Harbour in the [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality]]. The [[Cabot Trail]], circling the Cape Breton Highlands, and [[Nova Scotia Trunk 19|Trunk 19]], along the island's western coast, are important secondary roads. The [[Cape Breton and Central Nova Scotia Railway]] maintains railway connections between the port of Sydney to the [[Canadian National Railway]] in [[Truro, Nova Scotia|Truro]]\n\nThe [[Cabot Trail]] is a scenic road circuit around and over the [[Cape Breton Highlands]] with spectacular coastal vistas; over 400,000 visitors drive the Cabot Trail each summer and fall. Coupled with the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]], it has driven the growth of the tourism industry on the island in recent decades. The ''[[Cond\u00e9 Nast Publications|Cond\u00e9 Nast]]'' travel guide has rated Cape Breton Island as one of the world's best island destinations.\n\n==Traditional music==\n{{main|Cape Breton fiddling}}\n\nCape Breton is well known for its traditional fiddle music, which was brought to North America by Scottish immigrants during the [[Highland Clearances]]. The traditional style has been well preserved in Cape Breton, and [[c\u00e9ilidh]]s have become a popular attraction for tourists. [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness County]] in particular has a heavy concentration of musical activity, with regular performances in communities such as [[Mabou, Nova Scotia|Mabou]] and [[Judique, Nova Scotia|Judique]]. Judique is recognized as 'Baile nam Fonn', (literally: Village of Tunes) or the 'Home of Celtic Music', featuring the Celtic Music Interpretive Centre. Performers who have received significant recognition outside of Cape Breton include [[Bruce Guthro]], [[Buddy MacMaster]], [[Natalie MacMaster]], [[Ashley MacIsaac]], [[The Rankin Family]], [[Aselin Debison]], [[Gordie Sampson]], [[Lee Cremo]], and the [[Barra MacNeils]]. The Margaree's of Cape Breton also serve as a large contributor of fiddle music celebrated throughout the island. This traditional fiddle music of Cape Breton is studied by musicians around the world, where its global recognition continues to rise.\n\n[[The Men of the Deeps]] are a male choral group of current and former miners from the industrial Cape Breton area.\n\n==Film and television==\n*''[[Squanto: A Warrior's Tale]]'' (1994) starring [[Adam Beach]]\n*''[[Margaret's Museum]]'' (1995) starring [[Helena Bonham Carter]]\n*''[[The Bay Boy]]'' (1984) starring [[Kiefer Sutherland]]\n*''[[New Waterford Girl]]'' (1999) directed by [[Allan Moyle]]\n*''[[The Hanging Garden (film)|The Hanging Garden]]'' (1997) directed by [[Thom Fitzgerald]]\n*''[[Marion Bridge (film)|Marion Bridge]]'' (2002) directed by [[Wiebke von Carolsfeld]]\n*''[[My Bloody Valentine (film)|My Bloody Valentine]]'' (1981) directed by George Mihalka\n*''[[Pit Pony (film)|Pit Pony]]'' (1997), TV movie and [[Pit Pony (TV series)|series]] adapted from the [[Pit Pony (novel)|novel]] by [[Joyce Barkhouse]]\n*''[[The Book of Negroes (miniseries)|The Book of Negroes]]'' (2015) starring [[Cuba Gooding Jr.]] adapted from the novel of the same name by [[Lawrence Hill]]\n\n==Notable people==\n{{Main|List of people from Cape Breton}}\n\nCape Breton artists who have been recognized with major national or international awards include actor [[Harold Russell]] of [[North Sydney, Nova Scotia|North Sydney]], who won an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1946 for his portrayal of Homer Parrish in ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', and [[Lynn Coady]] and [[Linden MacIntyre]] of [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|Inverness County]], who are both past winners of the [[Giller Prize]] for [[Canadian literature]].

Price called the first stage the \"Cthulhu Mythos proper.\" This stage was formulated during Lovecraft's lifetime and was subject to his guidance.

He emphasized the point by stating in the opening sentence of the story that \"The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lovecraft|first1=H. P.|title=The Call of Cuthulhu|date=2014|publisher=Start Publishing LLC|location=Lanham|isbn=1609772695}}</ref>\n\nWriter [[Dirk W. Mosig]] notes that Lovecraft was a \"mechanistic materialist\" who embraced the philosophy of ''[[Cosmicism#Cosmic indifferentism|cosmic indifference]]''. Lovecraft believed in a purposeless, mechanical, and uncaring universe. Human beings, with their limited faculties, can never fully understand this universe, and the [[cognitive dissonance]] caused by this revelation leads to insanity, in his view. This perspective made no allowance for religious belief which could not be supported scientifically, with the incomprehensible, cosmic forces of his tales having as little regard for humanity as humans have for insects.{{clarify|date=June 2017|reason=How are the incomprehensible forces connected to this sentence?}}<ref>Mosig, Yozan Dirk W. \"Lovecraft: The Dissonance Factor in imaginary Literature\" (1979).</ref><ref name=\"Mariconda\">{{cite book|last1=Mariconda|first1=Steven J.|title=On the Emergence of \"Cthulhu\" & Other Observations|date=1995|publisher=Necronomicon Press|location=West Warwick, Rhode Island|isbn=9780940884816}}</ref>{{rp|22}}\n\nThere have been attempts at categorizing this fictional group of beings. Phillip A. Schreffler argues that by carefully scrutinizing Lovecraft's writings, a workable framework emerges that outlines the entire \"pantheon\"{{mdash}}from the unreachable \"Outer Ones\" (e.g. [[Azathoth]], who occupies the centre of the universe) and \"Great Old Ones\" (e.g. Cthulhu, imprisoned on Earth in the sunken city of [[R'lyeh]]) to the lesser castes (the lowly slave [[shoggoth]]s and the [[Mi-go]]).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shreffler|first1=Philip A.|title=The H.

Perhaps not. In fact, this very story, along with some hints from \"The Shadow over Innsmouth\", provides the key to the origin of the 'Derleth Mythos'.

Just as Lovecraft made passing reference to Clark Ashton Smith's ''[[Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature#Book of Eibon|Book of Eibon]]'', Derleth in turn added Smith's [[Outer God#Ubbo-Sathla|Ubbo-Sathla]] to the Mythos.<ref name=\"Price\"/>{{rp|9\u201310}}\n\nDerleth also attempted to connect the deities of the Mythos to the [[Classical element|four elements]] (\"air\", \"earth\", \"fire\", and \"water\"), creating new beings representative of certain elements in order to legitimize his system of classification. Derleth created \"Cthugha\" as a sort of fire elemental when a fan, Francis Towner Laney, complained that he had neglected to include the element in his schema. Laney, the editor of ''[[The Acolyte]]'', had categorized the Mythos in an essay that first appeared in the Winter 1942 issue of the magazine. \n\nImpressed by the glossary, Derleth asked Laney to rewrite it for publication in the Arkham House collection ''Beyond the Wall of Sleep'' ([[1943 in literature|1943]]).<ref>Robert M. Price, \"Editorial Shards\", ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'', p. 2.)</ref> Laney's essay (\"The Cthulhu Mythos\") was later republished in ''Crypt of Cthulhu #32'' (1985).

Most cranes accommodate both the camera and an operator, but some can be moved by [[remote control]]. Camera cranes go back to the dawn of movie-making, and were frequently used in [[silent films]] to enhance the epic nature of large sets and massive crowds. Another use is to move up and away from the actors, a common way of ending a [[movie]]. Crane shots are often found in what are supposed to be emotional or suspenseful scenes. One example of this technique is the shots taken by remote cranes in the car-chase sequence of the 1985 film ''[[To Live and Die in L.A. (film)|To Live and Die in L.A.]]''. Some filmmakers place the camera on a [[Crane (machine)|boom]] arm simply to make it easier to move around between ordinary set-ups.\n\n==Technique==\nThe major supplier of cranes in the [[cinema of the United States]] throughout the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s was the Chapman Company (later Chapman-Leonard of North Hollywood), supplanted by dozens of similar manufacturers around the world. The traditional design provided seats for both the director and the camera operator, and sometimes a third seat for the [[cinematographer]] as well. Large weights on the back of the crane compensate for the weight of the people riding the crane and must be adjusted carefully to avoid the possibility of accidents. During the 1960s, the tallest crane was the Chapman Titan crane, a massive design over 20 feet high that won an Academy Scientific & Engineering award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chapman-leonard.com/HISTORY.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301040241/http://www.chapman-leonard.com/HISTORY.html |archivedate=2013-03-01 |df= }}</ref> Most such cranes were manually operated, requiring an experienced boom operator who knew how to vertically raise,<ref name=Vineyard>{{citation |title=Setting Up Your Shots: Great Camera Moves Every Filmmaker Should Know|author= Jeremy Vineyard, Jose Cruz}}</ref> lower, and \"crab\" the camera alongside actors while the crane platform rolled on separate tracks. The crane operator and camera operator had to precisely coordinate their moves so that focus, pan, and camera position all started and stopped at the same time, requiring great skill and rehearsal.\n\n== Types ==\nCamera cranes may be small, medium, or large, depending on the load capacity and length of the loading arm. Historically, the first camera crane provided for lifting the chamber together with the operator, and sometimes an assistant. The range of motion of the boom was restricted because of the high load capacity and the need to ensure operator safety. In recent years a camera crane boom tripod with a remote control has become popular. It carries on the boom only a movie or television camera without an operator and allows shooting from difficult positions as a small load capacity makes it possible to achieve a long reach of the crane boom and relative freedom of movement. The operator controls the camera from the ground through a motorized panoramic head, using remote control and video surveillance by watching the image on the monitor. A separate category consists of telescopic camera cranes. These devices allow setting an arbitrary trajectory of the camera, eliminating the characteristic jib crane radial displacement that comes with traditional spanning shots. \n[[File:TV crane.jpg|thumbnail|Operator crane]]\n[[File:Telescopic operator crane.JPG|thumbnail|Telescopic operator crane]]\n\nLarge camera cranes are almost indistinguishable from the usual boom-type cranes, with the exception of special equipment for smoothly moving the boom and controlling noise. Small camera cranes and crane-trucks have a lightweight construction, often without a mechanical drive. The valves are controlled manually by balancing the load-specific counterweight, facilitating manipulation. To improve usability and repeatability of movement of the crane in different takes, the axis of rotation arrows are provided with limbs and a pointer. In some cases, the camera crane is mounted on a dolly for even greater camera mobility. Such devices are called crane trolleys. In modern films robotic cranes allow use of multiple actuators for high-accuracy repeated movement of the camera in trick photography. These devices are called tap-robots; some sources use the term motion control.\n\n== Manufacturers ==\nDuring the last few years, camera cranes have been miniaturized and costs have dropped so dramatically that most aspiring film makers have access to these tools.  What was once a \"[[Hollywood]]\" effect is now available for under $400. Main producers of cranes companies include ABC-Products, Cambo, Filmotechnic, Polecam, Panther and Matthews Studio Equipment.\n\n== Famous examples==\n[[File:Film Shooting From a Crane.jpg|thumb|Shooting from a manual crane]]\n*[[Leni Riefenstahl]] had a cameraman shoot a half-circle pan shot from a crane for the 1935 Nazi propaganda film [[Triumph of the Will]]<ref>''Hinter den Kulissen des Reichsparteitag-Films'', Riefenstahl's 1935 book on the making of the film, with many photographs, including an annotated one showing a cameraman on a crane (page 81)</ref>\n*A crane shot was used in Orson Welles' 1941 film ''[[Citizen Kane#Special effects|Citizen Kane]]''\n* The [[Western (genre)|Western]] ''[[High Noon]]'' had a famous crane shot. The shot backs up and rises, in order to show Marshal [[Will Kane]] totally alone and isolated on the street.\n* Director [[Dario Argento]] included an extensive scene in ''[[Tenebrae (film)|Tenebrae]]'' where the camera seemingly crawled over the walls and up a house wall, all in one seamless take. Due to its length, the tracking shot ended up being the production's most difficult and complex part to complete.\n* The 1980 comedy-drama film ''[[The Stunt Man]]'' featured a crane throughout the production of the fictitious film-within-a-film, directed by eccentric director [[Peter O'Toole]]. \n* The television comedy ''[[Second City Television]]'' (''SCTV'') uses the concept of the crane shot as comedic material. After using a crane shot in one of the first NBC-produced episodes, the network complained about the exorbitant cost of renting the crane. SCTV writers responded by making the \"crane shot\" a ubiquitous symbol of production excess while also lampooning network executives who care nothing about artistic vision and everything about the bottom line. At the end of the second season, an inebriated Johnny LaRue ([[John Candy]]) is given his very own crane by Santa Claus, implying he would be able to have a crane shot whenever he wanted it.\n* In his film ''[[Sympathy for the Devil (film)|Sympathy for the Devil]]'', [[Jean-Luc Godard]] used a crane for almost every shot in the movie, giving each scene a 360 degree tour of the tableau Godard presented to the viewer.  In the final scene he even shows the crane he was able to rent on his limited his budget by including it in the scene.  This was one of his traits as a filmmaker\u2014showing off his budget\u2014as he did with Brigitte Bardot in ''[[Le Mepris]]'' (''Contempt'').\n* Director [[Dennis Dugan]] frequently uses top-to-bottom crane shots in his comedy films.\n* [[Orson Welles]] used a crane camera during the iconic opening of ''[[Touch of Evil]]''. The camera perched on a Chapman crane begins on a close-up of a ticking time bomb and ends three-plus minutes later with a blinding explosion.\n* The closing take of [[Richard Attenborough]]'s film version of ''[[Oh! What a Lovely War]]'' begins with a single [[war grave]], gradually pulling back to reveal hundreds of identical crosses.\n* The 2004 [[Johnnie To]] film ''[[Breaking News (2004 film)|Breaking News]]'' opens with an elaborate seven-minute single-take crane shot.\n* The 1964 film by [[Mikhail Kalatozov]], ''[[I Am Cuba]]'' contains two of the most astonishing tracking shots ever attempted.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cinematic techniques}}\n\nCinema Technologies Group http://cinetechno.com/\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Crane Shot}}\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Cinematic techniques]]\n[[Category:Cranes (machines)]]", "sha1": "kxh6jbz5vlnjgbxh70hx12uxbadffni"}}, {"title": "Chariots of Fire", "ns": "0", "id": "5729", "revision": {"id": "865825614", "parentid": "865805149", "timestamp": "2018-10-26T12:19:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "Softlavender", "id": "3705239"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the film}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2012}}\n{{Infobox film\n| image = Chariots_of_fire.jpg\n| caption = Theatrical release poster\n| director = [[Hugh Hudson]]\n| producer = [[David Puttnam]]\n| writer = [[Colin Welland]]\n| starring       = {{plainlist|\n* [[Ben Cross]]\n* [[Ian Charleson]]\n* [[Nigel Havers]]\n* [[Cheryl Campbell]]\n* [[Alice Krige]]\n* [[Lindsay Anderson]]\n* [[Dennis Christopher]]\n* [[Nigel Davenport]]\n* [[Brad Davis (actor)|Brad Davis]]\n* [[Peter Egan]]\n* [[John Gielgud|Sir John Gielgud]]\n* [[Ian Holm]]\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]]\n}}\n| music = [[Vangelis]]\n| cinematography = [[David Watkin (cinematographer)|David Watkin]]\n| editing = [[Terry Rawlings]]\n| studio = [[Allied Stars Ltd]]<br />[[Goldcrest Films]]<br />Enigma Productions<br>[[The Ladd Company]]\n| distributor = [[Warner Bros.]]<br>{{small| (USA & Canada)}}<br>[[20th Century Fox]]<br>{{small| (International)}}\n| released = {{Film date|df=y|1981|3|30|<small>Royal Command Film Performance</small>|1981|5|15|<small>United Kingdom</small>}}\n| runtime = 124 minutes\n| country = United Kingdom\n| language = English\n| budget = $5.5 million (\u00a33 million)<ref name=\"icon\">Alexander Walker, ''Icons in the Fire: The Rise and Fall of Practically Everyone in the British Film Industry 1984-2000'', Orion Books, 2005 p28</ref>\n| gross = $59 million (U.S.)<ref>[http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=chariotsoffire.htm ''Chariots of Fire''] at [[Box Office Mojo]]</ref>\n}}\n'''''Chariots of Fire''''' is a 1981 British [[historical period drama|historical drama film]]. It tells the fact-based story of two athletes in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]: [[Eric Liddell]], a devout Scottish Christian who runs for the glory of God, and [[Harold Abrahams]], an English Jew who runs to overcome prejudice.\n\nThe film was conceived and produced by [[David Puttnam]], written by [[Colin Welland]], and directed by [[Hugh Hudson]]. [[Ben Cross]] and [[Ian Charleson]] starred as Abrahams and Liddell, alongside [[Nigel Havers]], [[Ian Holm]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[John Gielgud]], [[Cheryl Campbell]], and [[Alice Krige]] in supporting roles.\n\nIt was nominated for seven [[Academy Awards]] and won four, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It is ranked 19th in the [[British Film Institute]]'s list of [[BFI Top 100 British films|Top 100 British films]]. The film is also notable for its memorable [[Chariots of Fire (album)|electronic theme tune]] by [[Vangelis]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]].\n\nThe film's title was inspired by the line, \"Bring me my chariot of fire,\" from the [[William Blake]] poem adapted into the popular British hymn [[And did those feet in ancient time|\"Jerusalem\"]]; the hymn is heard at the end of the film.<ref>Dans, Peter E.

He becomes the first person to ever complete the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Trinity Great Court Run]], running around the college courtyard in the time it takes for the clock to strike 12, and achieves an undefeated string of victories in various national running competitions. Although focused on his running, he falls in love with a leading Gilbert and Sullivan soprano, Sybil ([[Alice Krige]]).\n\n[[Eric Liddell]] ([[Ian Charleson]]), born in China of Scottish missionary parents, is in Scotland. His devout sister Jennie ([[Cheryl Campbell]]) disapproves of Liddell's plans to pursue competitive running, but Liddell sees running as a way of glorifying God before returning to China to work as a missionary.\n\nWhen they first race against each other, Liddell beats Abrahams. Abrahams takes it poorly, but [[Sam Mussabini]] ([[Ian Holm]]), a professional trainer whom he had approached earlier, offers to take him on to improve his technique. This attracts criticism from the Cambridge college masters ([[John Gielgud]] and [[Lindsay Anderson]]), who allege it is not gentlemanly for an amateur to \"play the tradesman\" by employing a professional coach. Abrahams dismisses this concern, interpreting it as cover for anti-Semitic and class-based prejudice.<!--This is pretty well backed up by Gielgud's character's comments concerning \"a Semite\", \"a different god\" etc-->\n\nWhen Eric Liddell accidentally misses a church prayer meeting because of his running, his sister Jennie upbraids him and accuses him of no longer caring about God. Eric tells her that though he intends to eventually return to the China mission, he feels divinely inspired when running, and that not to run would be to dishonour God, saying, \"I believe that God made me for a purpose. But He also made me fast, and when I run, I feel His pleasure.\"\n\nThe two athletes, after years of training and racing, are accepted to represent Great Britain in the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]] in Paris. Also accepted are Abrahams' Cambridge friends, Lord Andrew Lindsay ([[Nigel Havers]]), [[Aubrey Montague]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), and [[H. B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]] ([[Daniel Gerroll]]).\n\nWhile boarding the boat to Paris for the Olympics, Liddell discovers the heats for his 100-metre race will be on a Sunday. He refuses to run the race, despite strong pressure from the [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] and the British Olympic committee, because his Christian convictions prevent him from running on the [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbath]].\n\nHope appears when Liddell's teammate Lindsay, having already won a silver medal in the [[400 metres hurdles]], proposes to concede his place in the [[400 metres|400-metre race]] on the following Thursday to Liddell, who gratefully agrees. His religious convictions in the face of national athletic pride make headlines around the world.\n\nLiddell delivers a sermon at the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] that Sunday, and quotes from [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/Isaiah#Chapter 40|Isaiah 40]], ending with, \"But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.\"\n\nAbrahams is badly beaten by the heavily favoured United States runners in the 200 metre race. He knows his last chance for a medal will be the 100 metres. He competes in the race, and wins. His coach Sam Mussabini is overcome that the years of dedication and training have paid off with an Olympic gold medal. Now Abrahams can get on with his life and reunite with his girlfriend Sybil, whom he had neglected for the sake of running.\n\nBefore Liddell's race, the American coach remarks dismissively to his runners that Liddell has little chance of doing well in his now far longer 400 metre race. But one of the American runners, [[Jackson Scholz]], hands Liddell a note of support for his convictions. Liddell defeats the American favourites and wins the gold medal.\n\nThe British team returns home triumphant. As the film ends, onscreen text explains that Abrahams married Sybil, and became the elder statesman of British athletics. Liddell went on to missionary work in China. All of Scotland mourned his death in 1945 in Japanese-occupied China.\n\n== Cast {{anchor|Main cast}} ==\n* [[Ben Cross]] as [[Harold Abrahams]], a Jewish student at Cambridge University\n* [[Ian Charleson]] as [[Eric Liddell]], the son of Scottish missionaries to China\n* [[Nicholas Farrell]] as [[Aubrey Montague]], a runner and friend of Harold Abrahams\n* [[Nigel Havers]] as Lord Andrew Lindsay, a Cambridge student runner partially based on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|David Burghley]] and [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]]\n* [[Ian Holm]] as [[Sam Mussabini]], Abrahams's running coach\n* [[John Gielgud]] as Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] at Cambridge University\n* [[Lindsay Anderson]] as Master of [[Caius College]] at Cambridge University\n* [[Cheryl Campbell]] as Jennie Liddell, Eric's devout sister (Janet Lillian \"Jenny\" Liddell)\n* [[Alice Krige]] as [[Sybil Gordon]], Abrahams' fianc\u00e9e (his actual fianc\u00e9e was [[Sybil Evers]])\n* [[Struan Rodger]] as Sandy McGrath, Liddell's friend and running coach\n* [[Nigel Davenport]] as [[F.

B. Stallard|Henry Stallard]], [[Aubrey Montague]], and Lord Andrew Lindsay. Abrahams and Stallard were in fact students there and competed in the 1924 Olympics. Montague also competed in the Olympics as depicted, but he attended Oxford, not Cambridge.<ref name=aubrey>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/mo/evelyn-montague-1.html Aubrey Montague biography] at SportsReference.com</ref> Aubrey Montague sent daily letters to his mother about his time at Oxford and the Olympics; these letters were the basis of Montague's narration in the film.\n\nThe character of Lindsay was based partially on [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], a significant figure in the history of British athletics. Although Burghley did attend Cambridge, he was not a contemporary of Harold Abrahams, as Abrahams was an undergraduate from 1919 to 1923 and Burghley was at Cambridge from 1923 to 1927. One scene in the film depicts the Burghley-based \"Lindsay\" as practising hurdles on his estate with full champagne glasses placed on each hurdle \u2013 this was something the wealthy Burghley did, although he used matchboxes instead of champagne glasses.<ref name=rw /> The fictional character of Lindsay was created when [[Douglas Lowe (athlete)|Douglas Lowe]], who was Britain's third athletics gold medallist in the 1924 Olympics, was not willing to be involved with the film.<ref>Chapman, pp. 275, 295.</ref>\n\n[[File:Cross and Havers.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Harold Abrahams|Abrahams]] (left) and the [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Burghley]]-based Lindsay (right) attempt the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]].]]\nAnother scene in the film recreates the [[Trinity Great Court#The Great Court Run|Great Court Run]], in which the runners attempt to run around the perimeter of the [[Trinity Great Court|Great Court]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in the time it takes the clock to strike 12 at midday. The film shows Abrahams performing the feat for the first time in history. In fact, Abrahams never attempted this race, and at the time of filming the only person on record known to have succeeded was [[David Cecil, 6th Marquess of Exeter|Lord Burghley]], in 1927. In ''Chariots of Fire'', Lindsay, who is based on Lord Burghley, runs the Great Court Run with Abrahams in order to spur him on, and crosses the finish line just a moment too late. Since the film's release, the Great Court Run has also been successfully run by Trinity undergraduate Sam Dobin, in October 2007.<ref>[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490027/Modern-day-hero-runs-away-Chariots-Fire-challenge.html \"Modern-day hero runs away with Chariots of Fire challenge.\"] ''[[Daily Mail]]'' 27 October 2007.</ref>\n\nIn the film, Eric Liddell is tripped up by a Frenchman in the 400-metre event of a Scotland\u2013France international athletic meeting. He recovers, makes up a 20-metre deficit, and wins. This was based on fact; the actual race was the 440 yards at a Triangular Contest meet between Scotland, England, and Ireland at [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in England in July 1923. His achievement was remarkable as he had already won the 100- and 220-yard events that day.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Russell W.|title=God's Joyful Runner|publisher=Bridge Publishing, Inc|year=1987|page=54|isbn=0-88270-624-1}}</ref> Also unmentioned with regard to Liddell is that it was he who introduced Abrahams to [[Sam Mussabini]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/sportscotland/asportingnation/article/0019/ |title=A Sporting Nation: Eric Liddell |publisher=BBC.co.uk|accessdate=13 March 2012}}</ref> This is alluded to: In the film Abrahams first encounters Mussabini while he is watching Liddell race. The film, however, suggests that Abrahams himself sought Mussabini's assistance.\n\nAbrahams and Liddell did race against each other once, but not quite as depicted in the film, which shows Liddell winning the final of the 100 yards against a shattered Abrahams at the 1923 AAA Championship at Stamford Bridge.  In fact, they raced only in a heat of the 220 yards, which Liddell won, five yards ahead of Abrahams, who did not progress to the final.  In the 100 yards, Abrahams was eliminated in the heats and never raced against Liddell, who won the finals of both races the next day.<ref>{{cite book|last=McCasland|first=David|title=Pure Gold: A New Biography of the Olympic Champion Who Inspired Chariots of Fire|publisher=Discovery House|year=2001|isbn=1572931302}}</ref>\n\nAbrahams' fianc\u00e9e is misidentified as [[Sybil Gordon]], a soprano at the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].

Her disapproval of Liddell's track career was creative licence; she actually fully supported his sporting work. Jenny Liddell Somerville cooperated fully with the making of the film and has a brief cameo in the Paris [[Church of Scotland]] during Liddell's sermon.<ref>Ramsey, Russell W.

However, Montague died in 1948, 30 years before Abrahams' death.\n\n===1924 Olympics===\n{{See also|Great Britain at the 1924 Summer Olympics}}\n\nThe film takes some liberties with the events at the 1924 Olympics, including the events surrounding Liddell's refusal to race on a Sunday. In the film, he doesn't learn that the 100-metre heat is to be held on the Christian Sabbath until he is boarding the boat to Paris. In fact, the schedule was made public several months in advance; Liddell did however face immense pressure to run on that Sunday and to compete in the 100 metres, getting called before a grilling by the British Olympic Committee, the Prince of Wales, and other [[grandee]]s,<ref name=hudson/> and his refusal to run made headlines around the world.<ref>Murray, Feg.

''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 24 June 1924. Full headline reads, \"Did You Know That Famous Scotch Sprinter Will Not Run in the Olympic 100 Metres Because The Trials Are Run on Sunday\".</ref>\n\nThe decision to change races was, even so, made well before embarking to Paris, and Liddell spent the intervening months training for the 400 metres, an event in which he had previously excelled. It is true, nonetheless, that Liddell's success in the Olympic 400m was largely unexpected.\n\nThe film depicts Lindsay, having already won a medal in the 400-metre hurdles, giving up his place in the 400-metre race for Liddell. In fact [[David Burghley|Burghley]], on whom Lindsay is loosely based, was eliminated in the heats of the 110 hurdles (he would go on to win a gold medal in the 400 hurdles at the 1928 Olympics), and was not entered for the 400 metres.\n\nThe film reverses the order of Abrahams' 100m and 200m races at the Olympics. In reality, after winning the 100 metres race, Abrahams ran the [[200 metres]] but finished last, [[Jackson Scholz]] taking the gold medal. In the film, before his triumph in the 100m, Abrahams is shown losing the 200m and being scolded by Mussabini. And during the following scene in which Abrahams speaks with his friend Montague while receiving a massage from Mussabini, there is a French newspaper clipping showing Scholz and [[Charlie Paddock]] with a headline which states that the 200 metres was a triumph for the United States. In the same conversation, Abrahams laments getting \"beaten out of sight\" in the 200. The film thus has Abrahams overcoming the disappointment of losing the 200 by going on to win the 100, a reversal of the real order.\n\nEric Liddell actually also ran in the 200m race, and finished third, behind Paddock and Scholz. This was the only time in reality that Liddell and Abrahams competed in the same race. While their meeting in the 1923 [[Amateur Athletic Association|AAA]] Championship in the film was fictitious, Liddell's record win in that race did spur Abrahams to train even harder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |title=Recollections by Sir Arthur Marshall |publisher=Content.ericliddell.org |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215092135/http://content.ericliddell.org/ericliddell/recollections/content/arthurmarshall.htm |archivedate=15 February 2009 }}</ref>\n\nAbrahams also won a silver medal as an opening runner for the [[4 x 100 metres relay]] team, not shown in the film, and [[Aubrey Montague]] placed sixth in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]], as depicted.<ref name=aubrey />\n\n====Personal inaccuracies at the Olympics====\nIn the film, the 100m bronze medallist is a character called \"Tom Watson\"; the real medallist was [[Arthur Porritt, Baron Porritt|Arthur Porritt]] of New Zealand, who refused permission for his name to be used in the film, allegedly out of modesty, and his wish was accepted by the film's producers, even though his permission was not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|author=Arthur Espie Porritt 1900\u20131994 |url=http://www.library.otago.ac.nz/exhibitions/rhodes_scholars/arthur_espie_porritt.html |title=Reference to Porritt's modesty |publisher=Library.otago.ac.nz |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009}}</ref> However, the brief back-story given for Watson, who is called up to the New Zealand team from the [[University of Oxford]], substantially matches Porritt's history. With the exception of Porritt, all the runners in the 100m final are identified correctly when they line up for inspection by the Prince of Wales.\n\nJackson Scholz is depicted as handing Liddell an inspirational Bible-quotation message before the 400 metres final: \"It says in the Old Book, 'He that honors me, I will honor.' Good luck.\"<ref>The quoted passage is [[Books of Samuel|First Samuel]] [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/1 Samuel#2:30|2:30]].</ref> In reality, the note was from members of the British team, and was handed to Liddell before the race by his attending masseur at the team's Paris hotel.<ref name=reid>Reid, Alasdair. \"Harold Abrahams and Eric Liddell\".

One of them is the background music to the race Eric Liddell runs in the Scottish highlands. This piece is a version of \"Hymne\", the original version of which appears on Vangelis's 1979 album, ''[[Op\u00e9ra sauvage]]''. Various versions are also included on Vangelis's compilation albums ''[[Themes (Vangelis album)|Themes]]'', ''[[Portraits (So Long Ago, So Clear)|Portraits]]'', and ''[[Odyssey: The Definitive Collection]]'', though none of these include the version used in the film.\n\nFive lively [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] tunes also appear in the soundtrack, and serve as jaunty period music which nicely counterpoints Vangelis's modern electronic score. These are: \"He is an Englishman\" from ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', \"Three Little Maids from School Are We\" from ''[[The Mikado]]'', \"With Catlike Tread\" from ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', \"The Soldiers of Our Queen\" from ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', and \"There Lived a King\" from ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.\n\nThe film also incorporates a major traditional work: \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\", sung by a British choir at the 1978 funeral of Harold Abrahams. The words, written by William Blake in 1804-8, were set to music by Parry in 1916 as a celebration of England.

Thus, from a consequentialist standpoint, a morally right act (or omission from acting) is one that will produce a good outcome, or consequence. \n\nConsequentialism is primarily non-prescriptive, meaning the moral worth of an action is determined by its potential consequence, not by whether it follows a set of written edicts or laws. One example would entail lying under the threat of government punishment to save an innocent person's life, even though it is illegal to lie under oath.\n\nConsequentialism is usually contrasted with [[deontological ethics]] (or ''deontology''), in that deontology, in which rules and moral duty are central, derives the rightness or wrongness of one's conduct from the character of the behaviour itself rather than the outcomes of the conduct. It is also contrasted with [[virtue ethics]], which focuses on the character of the agent rather than on the nature or consequences of the act (or omission) itself, and [[pragmatic ethics]] which treats morality like science: advancing socially over the course of many lifetimes, such that any moral criterion is subject to revision. Consequentialist theories differ in how they define [[Value theory|moral goods]].\n\nSome argue that consequentialist and deontological theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. For example, [[T. M. Scanlon]] advances the idea that [[human rights]], which are commonly considered a \"deontological\" concept, can only be justified with reference to the consequences of having those rights.<ref name=\"Scheffler\"/> Similarly, [[Robert Nozick]] argues for a theory that is mostly consequentialist, but incorporates inviolable \"side-constraints\" which restrict the sort of actions agents are permitted to do.<ref name=\"Scheffler\"/>\n\n==Philosophies==\n===State consequentialism===\n{{Main|State consequentialism}}\n\n{{quote|It is the business of the benevolent man to seek to promote what is beneficial to the world and to eliminate what is harmful, and to provide a model for the world.

This form of utilitarianism holds that what matters is the aggregate happiness; the happiness of everyone and not the happiness of any particular person. [[John Stuart Mill]], in his exposition of hedonistic utilitarianism, proposed a hierarchy of pleasures, meaning that the pursuit of certain kinds of pleasure is more highly valued than the pursuit of other pleasures.<ref name=\"Mill\">{{Cite book| title = Utilitarianism | year = 1998 | last = Mill | first = John Stuart | authorlink = John Stuart Mill | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-875163-2 | url = http://www.utilitarianism.com/mill1.htm}}</ref> However, some contemporary utilitarians, such as [[Peter Singer]], are concerned with maximizing the satisfaction of preferences, hence \"[[preference utilitarianism]]\". Other contemporary forms of utilitarianism mirror the forms of consequentialism outlined below.\n\n===Ethical egoism===\n{{Main|Ethical egoism}}\n\n[[Ethical egoism]] can be understood as a consequentialist theory according to which the consequences for the individual agent are taken to matter more than any other result. Thus, egoism will prescribe actions that may be beneficial, detrimental, or neutral to the welfare of others.  Some, like [[Henry Sidgwick]], argue that a certain degree of egoism ''promotes'' the general welfare of society for two reasons: because individuals know how to please themselves best, and because if everyone were an austere altruist then general welfare would inevitably decrease.<ref name=\"Sidgwick\">{{Cite book|title=The Method of Ethics |year=1907 |last=Sidgwick |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Sidgwick |publisher=Dover (1981) |location=NY |isbn=0-915145-28-6 |url=http://www.la.utexas.edu/methsidg/me/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209092717/http://www.la.utexas.edu/methsidg/me/ |archivedate=December 9, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Ethical altruism===\n{{Main|Altruism (ethics)}}\n[[Altruism (ethics)|Ethical altruism]] can be seen as a consequentialist ethic which prescribes that an individual take actions that have the best consequences for everyone except for himself.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethics |first=James |last=Fisher |first2=Bradley |last2=Dowdwen |work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/ }}</ref> This was advocated by [[Auguste Comte]], who coined the term \"altruism,\" and whose ethics can be summed up in the phrase \"Live for others\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Moran |first=Gabriel |title=Christian Religion and National Interests |date=2006 |url=https://www.nyu.edu/classes/gmoran/APRRE04.pdf }}{{reliable source|date=July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Rule consequentialism===\n{{See also|Rule utilitarianism}}\nIn general, consequentialist theories focus on actions. However, this need not be the case. Rule consequentialism is a theory that is sometimes seen as an attempt to reconcile [[deontology]] and consequentialism\u2014and in some cases, this is stated as a criticism of rule consequentialism.<ref>Bernard Williams, \"Utilitarianism\" in his ''Morality'', Cambridge University Press 1993</ref>  Like deontology, rule consequentialism holds that moral behavior involves following certain rules. However, rule consequentialism chooses rules based on the consequences that the selection of those rules has. Rule consequentialism exists in the forms of [[rule utilitarianism]] and [[rule egoism]].\n\nVarious theorists are split as to whether the rules are the only determinant of moral behavior or not. For example, [[Robert Nozick]] holds that a certain set of minimal rules, which he calls \"side-constraints\", are necessary to ensure appropriate actions.<ref name=\"Scheffler\"/> There are also differences as to how absolute these moral rules are. Thus, while Nozick's side-constraints are absolute restrictions on behavior, [[Amartya Sen]] proposes a theory that recognizes the importance of certain rules, but these rules are not absolute.<ref name=\"Scheffler\"/> That is, they may be violated if strict adherence to the rule would lead to much more undesirable consequences.\n\nOne of the most common objections to rule-consequentialism is that it is incoherent, because it is based on the consequentialist principle that what we should be concerned with is maximizing the good, but then it tells us not to act to maximize the good, but to follow rules (even in cases where we know that breaking the rule could produce better results).\n\n[[Brad Hooker]] avoided this objection by not basing his form of rule-consequentialism on the ideal of maximizing the good. He writes:\n\n<blockquote>\u2026the best argument for rule-consequentialism is not that it derives from an overarching commitment to maximise the good. The best argument for rule-consequentialism is that it does a better job than its rivals of matching and tying together our moral convictions, as well as offering us help with our moral disagreements and uncertainties.<ref>Brad Hooker, ''Ideal Code, Real World'' Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 101.</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[Derek Parfit]] described Brad Hooker's book on rule-consequentialism ''Ideal Code, Real World'' as the \"best statement and defence, so far, of one of the most important moral theories\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Brad |last=Hooker |title=Ideal Code, Real World |publisher= Oxford University Press, new edition 2002, back cover |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/reader/0199256578/278-8451642-5085302?_encoding=UTF8&ref_=sib_rdr_bc&j=0&page=234#reader-page}}</ref>\n\nRule-consequentialism may offer a means to reconcile pure consequentialism with [[deontology|deontological]], or rules-based ethics.<ref>{{cite article |first=Jeevan |last=D'Souza |title=On Measuring the Moral Value of Action |publisher= Philos, China |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeevan_Dsouza2/publication/301688068_On_Measuring_the_Moral_Value_of_Action/links/59d8ee11a6fdcc2aad0d86cf/On-Measuring-the-Moral-Value-of-Action.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Two-level consequentialism===\nThe two-level approach involves engaging in critical reasoning and considering all the possible ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules when one is not in a position to stand back and examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to stand back and reason on a more critical level.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/consequentialism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Sinnott-Armstrong|first=Walter|date=2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThis position can be described as a reconciliation between act consequentialism \u2013 in which the morality of an action is determined by that action's effects \u2013 and rule consequentialism \u2013 in which moral behavior is derived from following rules that lead to positive outcomes.<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe two-level approach to consequentialism is most often associated with [[R. M. Hare]] and [[Peter Singer]].<ref name=\":0\" />{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n===Motive consequentialism===\nAnother consequentialist version is motive consequentialism which looks at whether the state of affairs that results from the motive to choose an action is better or at least as good as each of the alternative state of affairs that would have resulted from alternative actions. This version gives relevance to the motive of an act and links it to its consequences. An act can therefore not be wrong if the decision to act was based on a right motive. A possible inference is, that one can not be blamed for mistaken judgments if the motivation was to do good.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adams |first=R. M. |year=1976 |title=Motive Utilitarianism |journal=Journal of Philosophy |volume=73 |issue=14 |pages=467\u201381 |doi=10.2307/2025783 }}</ref>\n\n===Negative consequentialism===\nMost consequentialist theories focus on ''promoting'' some sort of good consequences. However, [[negative utilitarianism]] lays out a consequentialist theory that focuses solely on minimizing bad consequences.\n\nOne major difference between these two approaches is the agent's responsibility. Positive consequentialism demands that we bring about good states of affairs, whereas negative consequentialism requires that we avoid bad ones. Stronger versions of negative consequentialism will require active intervention to prevent bad and ameliorate existing harm. In weaker versions, simple forbearance from acts tending to harm others is sufficient. An example of this is the [[Slippery slope|Slippery Slope]] Argument, which encourages others to avoid a specified act on the grounds that it may ultimately lead to undesirable consequences.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haigh|first=Matthew|last2=Wood|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Stewart|first3=Andrew J.|date=2016-07-01|title=Slippery slope arguments imply opposition to change|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-016-0596-9|journal=Memory & Cognition|language=en|volume=44|issue=5|pages=819\u2013836|doi=10.3758/s13421-016-0596-9|issn=0090-502X}}</ref>\n\nOften \"negative\" consequentialist theories assert that reducing suffering is more important than increasing pleasure. [[Karl Popper]], for example, claimed \"\u2026from the moral point of view, pain cannot be outweighed by pleasure...\". (While Popper is not a consequentialist per se, this is taken as a classic statement of negative utilitarianism.) When considering a theory of justice, negative consequentialists may use a statewide or global-reaching principle: the reduction of suffering (for the disadvantaged) is more valuable than increased pleasure (for the affluent or luxurious).\n\n===Teleological ethics===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}\n\nTeleological ethics (Greek telos, \"end\"; logos, \"science\") is an ethical theory that holds that the ends or consequences of an act determine whether an act is good or evil. Teleological theories are often discussed in opposition to [[deontological]] ethical theories, which hold that acts themselves are ''inherently'' good or evil, regardless of the consequences of acts.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The [[saying]], \"the [[End (philosophy)|end]] justifies the [[wikt:the end justifies the means|means]]\",<ref>{{cite book|page=104|last=Mizzoni|first=John|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|title=Ethics: The Basics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AsGbVvQA23oC&pg=PA104&dq=%22justify+the+means%22}}</ref> meaning that if a goal is morally important enough, any method of achieving it is acceptable.<ref>[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/british/the-end-justifies-the-means Cambridge Dictionary: the end justifies the means]</ref>\n\nTeleological theories differ on the nature of the end that actions ought to promote. [[Eudaemonist]] theories (Greek eudaimonia, \"happiness\") hold that the goal of ethics consists in some function or activity appropriate to man as a human being, and thus tend to emphasize the cultivation of virtue or excellence in the agent as the end of all action. These could be the classical virtues\u2014[[courage]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[Justice (virtue)|justice]], and [[wisdom]]\u2014that promoted the Greek ideal of man as the \"rational animal\", or the theological virtues\u2014[[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[hope]], and [[love]]\u2014that distinguished the Christian ideal of man as a being created in the image of God.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n[[File:JohnStuartMill.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart Mill]], an influential liberal thinker of the 19th century and a teacher of [[utilitarianism]]]]\nUtilitarian-type theories hold that the end consists in an experience or feeling produced by the action. [[Hedonism]], for example, teaches that this feeling is pleasure\u2014either one's own, as in egoism (the 17th-century English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]]), or everyone's, as in universalistic hedonism, or [[utilitarianism]] (the 19th-century English philosophers [[Jeremy Bentham]], [[John Stuart Mill]], and [[Henry Sidgwick]]), with its formula of the \"greatest pleasure of the greatest number\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nOther utilitarian-type views include the claims that the end of action is survival and growth, as in [[evolutionary ethics]] (the 19th-century English philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]]); the experience of power, as in [[despotism]]; satisfaction and adjustment, as in [[pragmatism]] (20th-century American philosophers [[Ralph Barton Perry]] and [[John Dewey]]); and freedom, as in [[existentialism]] (the 20th-century French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]).{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\nThe chief problem for [[eudaemonist]] theories is to show that leading a life of virtue will also be attended by happiness\u2014by the winning of the goods regarded as the chief end of action. That [[Job (Bible)|Job]] should suffer and [[Socrates]] and [[Jesus]] die while the wicked prosper, then seems unjust. Eudaemonists generally reply that the universe is moral and that, in Socrates' words, \"No evil can happen to a good man, either in life or after death,\" or, in Jesus' words, \"But he who endures to the end will be saved.\" (Matt 10:22).\n\nUtilitarian theories, on the other hand, must answer the charge that ends do not justify the means. The problem arises in these theories because they tend to separate the achieved ends from the action by which these ends were produced. One implication of utilitarianism is that one's intention in performing an act may include all of its foreseen consequences. The goodness of the intention then reflects the balance of the good and evil of these consequences, with no limits imposed upon it by the nature of the act itself\u2014even if it be, say, the breaking of a promise or the execution of an innocent man. Utilitarianism, in answering this charge, must show either that what is apparently immoral is not really so or that, if it really is so, then closer examination of the consequences will bring this fact to light. Ideal utilitarianism ([[G.E. Moore]] and [[Hastings Rashdall]]) tries to meet the difficulty by advocating a plurality of ends and including among them the attainment of virtue itself, which, as [[John Stuart Mill]] affirmed, \"may be felt a good in itself, and desired as such with as great intensity as any other good\".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Acts and omissions, and the \"act and omissions doctrine\"===\nSince pure consequentialism holds that an action is to be judged solely by its result, most consequentialist theories hold that a deliberate action is no different from a deliberate decision not to act. This contrasts with the \"acts and omissions doctrine\", which is upheld by some medical ethicists and some religions: it asserts there is a significant moral distinction between acts and deliberate non-actions which lead to the same outcome. This contrast is brought out in issues such as [[voluntary euthanasia]].\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Action guidance===\nOne important characteristic of many [[Normative ethics|normative]] moral theories such as consequentialism is the ability to produce practical moral judgements. At the very least, any moral theory needs to define the standpoint from which the goodness of the consequences are to be determined. What is primarily at stake here is the ''[[moral responsibility|responsibility]]'' of the agent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n====The ideal observer====\nOne common tactic among consequentialists, particularly those committed to an [[Altruism|altruistic]] (selfless) account of consequentialism, is to employ an ideal, neutral observer from which moral judgements can be made. [[John Rawls]], a critic of utilitarianism, argues that utilitarianism, in common with other forms of consequentialism, relies on the perspective of such an ideal observer.<ref name=\"Scheffler\"/> The particular characteristics of this ideal observer can vary from an omniscient observer, who would grasp all the consequences of any action, to an ideally informed observer, who knows as much as could reasonably be expected, but not necessarily all the circumstances or all the possible consequences. Consequentialist theories that adopt this paradigm hold that right action is the action that will bring about the best consequences from this ideal observer's perspective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n====The real observer====\nIn practice, it is very difficult, and at times arguably impossible, to adopt the point of view of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know everything about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action in line with what they know about the situation.<ref name=\"Mackie\">{{Cite book|last=Mackie |first=J. L. |authorlink=J. L. Mackie |origyear=1977 |title=Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong |publisher=Penguin |location=London |isbn=0-14-013558-8 |year=1990}}</ref> However, if this approach is na\u00efvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Consequences for whom===\n[[File:Surveyed Consequences of Whistleblowing.png|thumb|Surveyed consequences of [[Whistleblower|whistleblowing]]]]\n\nMoral action always has consequences for certain people or things. Varieties of consequentialism can be differentiated by the beneficiary of the good consequences. That is, one might ask \"Consequences for whom?\"\n\n====Agent-focused or agent-neutral====\nA fundamental distinction can be drawn between theories which require that agents act for ends perhaps disconnected from their own interests and drives, and theories which permit that agents act for ends in which they have some personal interest or [[motivation]].  These are called \"agent-neutral\" and \"agent-focused\" theories respectively.\n\nAgent-neutral consequentialism ignores the specific value a state of affairs has for any particular agent. Thus, in an agent-neutral theory, an actor's personal goals do not count any more than anyone else's goals in evaluating what action the actor should take. Agent-focused consequentialism, on the other hand, focuses on the particular needs of the moral agent. Thus, in an agent-focused account, such as one that [[Peter Railton]] outlines, the agent might be concerned with the general welfare, but the agent is ''more'' concerned with the immediate welfare of herself and her friends and family.<ref name=\"Scheffler\">{{Cite book| title = Consequentialism and Its Critics | year = 1988 | last = Scheffler | first = Samuel (Ed.) | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-19-875073-4}}</ref>\n\nThese two approaches could be reconciled by acknowledging the tension between an agent's interests as an individual and as a member of various groups, and seeking to somehow optimize among all of these interests.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} For example, it may be meaningful to speak of an action as being good for someone as an individual, but bad for them as a citizen of their town.\n\n====Human-centered?====\nMany consequentialist theories may seem primarily concerned with human beings and their relationships with other human beings. However, some philosophers argue that we should not limit our ethical consideration to the interests of human beings alone. [[Jeremy Bentham]], who is regarded as the founder of [[utilitarianism]], argues that animals can experience pleasure and pain, thus demanding that 'non-human animals' should be a serious object of moral concern.<ref name=\"Bentham\">{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Principles of Moral Legislation |year=1996 |last=Bentham |first=Jeremy |authorlink=Jeremy Bentham |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-820516-6 |url=http://www.la.utexas.edu/research/poltheory/bentham/ipml/ipml.toc.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105091421/http://www.la.utexas.edu/research/poltheory/bentham/ipml/ipml.toc.html |archivedate=January 5, 2008 }}</ref> More recently, [[Peter Singer]] has argued that it is unreasonable that we do not give equal consideration to the interests of animals as to those of human beings when we choose the way we are to treat them.<ref name=\"Singer\">{{Cite book| title = Unsanctifying Human Life | last = Singer | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Singer | editor = Helga Kuhse, ed. | year = 2002 | publisher = Blackwell | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0-631-22507-2}}</ref> Such equal consideration does not necessarily imply identical treatment of humans and non-humans, any more than it necessarily implies identical treatment of all humans.\n\n===Value of consequences===\nOne way to divide various consequentialisms is by the types of consequences that are taken to matter most, that is, which consequences count as good states of affairs. According to [[utilitarianism]], a good action is one that results in an increase in [[pleasure]], and the best action is one that results in the most pleasure for the greatest number. Closely related is [[eudaimonia|eudaimonic]] consequentialism, according to which a full, flourishing life, which may or may not be the same as enjoying a great deal of pleasure, is the ultimate aim. Similarly, one might adopt an aesthetic consequentialism, in which the ultimate aim is to produce beauty. However, one might fix on non-psychological goods as the relevant effect. Thus, one might pursue an increase in [[Equality of outcome|material equality]] or [[Freedom (political)|political liberty]] instead of something like the more ephemeral \"pleasure\". Other theories adopt a package of several goods, all to be promoted equally.\n\n===Virtue ethics===\nConsequentialism can also be contrasted with [[arete (moral virtue)|aretaic]] moral theories such as [[virtue ethics]]. Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary focus of our thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists that it is the character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character. For example, [[Philippa Foot]] argues that consequences in themselves have no ethical content, unless it has been provided by a virtue such as benevolence.<ref name=\"Scheffler\"/>\n\nHowever, consequentialism and virtue ethics need not be entirely antagonistic. [[Iain King]] has developed an approach that reconciles the two schools.<ref>King, Ian (2008). ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]],'' London: Continuum.</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2018}}{{better source|date=August 2018}} Other consequentialists consider effects on the character of people involved in an action when assessing consequence. Similarly, a consequentialist theory may aim at the maximization of a particular virtue or set of virtues. Finally, following Foot's lead, one might adopt a sort of consequentialism that argues that virtuous activity ultimately produces the best consequences.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}{{Clarify|What issue in consequentialism is being discussed here?|date=February 2012}}\n[[File:Max Weber 1894.jpg|thumb|Max Weber]]\n\n===Ultimate end===\nThe ''ultimate end'' is a concept in the moral philosophy of [[Max Weber]], in which individuals act in a faithful, rather than rational, manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n{{quote|We must be clear about the fact that all ethically oriented conduct may be guided by one of two fundamentally differing and irreconcilably opposed maxims: conduct can be oriented to an \"ethic of ultimate ends\" or to an \"ethic of responsibility.\" This is not to say that an ethic of ultimate ends is identical with irresponsibility, or that an ethic of responsibility is identical with unprincipled opportunism. Naturally, nobody says that. However, there is an abysmal contrast between conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of ultimate ends\u2014that, is in religious terms, \"the Christian does rightly and leaves the results with the Lord\"\u2014and conduct that follows the maxim of an ethic of responsibility, in which case one has to give an account of the foreseeable results of one's action.|Max Weber, ''Politics as a Vocation'',  1918}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term \"consequentialism\" was {{cns|text=coined by|reason=is this the first use of the term \"consequentialism\"?|date=March 2016}} [[G.

Williams argues that consequentialism requires moral agents to take a strictly impersonal view of all actions, since it is only the consequences, and not who produces them, that are said to matter. Williams argues that this demands too much of moral agents\u2014since (he claims) consequentialism demands that they be willing to sacrifice any and all personal projects and commitments in any given circumstance in order to pursue the most beneficent course of action possible. He argues further that consequentialism fails to make sense of intuitions that it can matter whether or not someone is personally the author of a particular consequence. For example, that participating in a crime can matter, even if the crime would have been committed anyway, or would even have been worse, without the agent's participation.<!-- This really needs a quick discussion of William's firing-squad example.

Railton argues that Williams's criticisms can be avoided by adopting a form of consequentialism in which moral decisions are to be determined by the sort of life that they express. On his account, the agent should choose the sort of life that will, on the whole, produce the best overall effects.<ref name=\"Scheffler\"/>\n\n==Notable consequentialists==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Robert Merrihew Adams|R.

The modern system of near-universal national conscription for young men dates to the [[French Revolution]] in the 1790s, where it became the basis of a very large and powerful [[military]]. Most [[Europe]]an nations later copied the system in peacetime, so that men at a certain age would serve 1\u20138 years on [[active duty]] and then transfer to the [[military reserve force|reserve force]].\n\nConscription is controversial for a range of reasons, including [[conscientious objection]] to military engagements on religious or philosophical grounds; political objection, for example to service for a disliked government or unpopular war; and ideological objection, for example, to a perceived violation of individual rights. Those conscripted may evade service, sometimes by leaving the country,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cbc.ca/war_conflict/vietnam_war/topics/348/ |title=Seeking Sanctuary: Draft Dodgers |newspaper= CBC Digital Archives }}</ref> and seeking [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in another country. Some selection systems accommodate these attitudes by providing [[alternative service]] outside [[combat]]-operations roles or even outside the military, such as 'Siviilipalvelus' (alternative civil service) in Finland, [[Zivildienst]] (compulsory community service) in [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Many post-Soviet countries conscript male soldiers not only for armed forces but also for paramilitary organizations which are dedicated to [[police]]-like ''domestic only'' service ([[Internal Troops]]) or ''non-[[combat]]'' [[rescue|rescue duties]] ([[Civil defence|Civil defence troops]]) \u2013 none of which is considered alternative to the military conscription.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, many states no longer conscript soldiers, relying instead upon professional militaries with [[volunteer military|volunteers]] enlisted to meet the demand for troops. The ability to rely on such an arrangement, however, presupposes some degree of predictability with regard to both war-fighting requirements and the scope of hostilities. Many states that have abolished conscription therefore still reserve the power to resume it during [[war]]time or times of crisis.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/second-world-war-wwii/ <!--Bot repaired link--> |title=World War II |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] }}</ref> States involved in wars or interstate rivalries are most likely to implement conscription, whereas democracies are less likely than autocracies to implement conscription.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Asal|first=Victor|last2=Conrad|first2=Justin|last3=Toronto|first3=Nathan|date=2017-08-01|title=I Want You!

Under that system those eligible were required to serve in the royal army in time of war. During times of peace they were instead required to provide labour for other activities of the state. In return for this service, people subject to it gained the right to hold land.

While it was outlawed by the [[Code of Hammurabi]], the hiring of substitutes appears to have been practiced both before and after the creation of the code. Later records show that Ilkum commitments could become regularly traded. In other places, people simply left their towns to avoid their Ilkum service.

In the 690s Laws of [[Ine of Wessex|Ine]], three levels of fines are imposed on different social classes for neglecting military service.<ref>Attenborough ''Laws of the Earliest English Kings'' https://archive.org/stream/lawsofearliesten00grea#page/52\n</ref> Some modern writers claim military service was restricted to the landowning minor nobility. These [[thegn]]s were the land-holding aristocracy of the time and were required to serve with their own armour and weapons for a certain number of days each year. The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the ''fyrd'' as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a \"ridiculous fantasy\":<blockquote>The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or ''fyrd'' is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.<ref>Sturdy, David ''Alfred the Great'' Constable (1995), p. 153</ref></blockquote>\n\nMedieval levy in Poland was known as the ''[[pospolite ruszenie]]''.\n\n====Military slavery====\n[[File:Battle of Vienna.SultanMurads with janissaries.jpg|thumb|Ottoman [[Janissary|janissaries]]]]\n\nThe system of military [[slaves]] was widely used in the Middle East, beginning with the creation of the corps of [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] slave-soldiers (''[[ghulam]]s'' or ''[[mamluk]]s'') by the [[Abbasid caliph]] [[al-Mu'tasim]] in the 820s and 830s. The Turkish troops soon came to [[Anarchy at Samarra|dominate the government]], establishing a pattern throughout the Islamic world of a ruling military class, often separated by ethnicity, culture and even religion by the mass of the population, a paradigm that found its apogee in the [[Mamluks of Egypt]] and the [[Janissary]] corps of the [[Ottoman Empire]], institutions that survived until the early 19th century.\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, Ottoman Sultan [[Murad I]] developed personal troops to be loyal to him, with a slave army called the ''[[Kap\u0131kulu]]''. The new force was built by taking Christian children from newly conquered lands, especially from the far areas of his empire, in a system known as the ''[[dev\u015firme]]'' (translated \"gathering\" or \"converting\"). The captive children were forced to convert to [[Islam]]. The Sultans [[Military use of children|had the young boys trained]] over several years. Those who showed special promise in fighting skills were trained in advanced warrior skills, put into the sultan's personal service, and turned into the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], the elite branch of the ''Kap\u0131kulu''. A number of distinguished military commanders of the Ottomans, and most of the imperial administrators and upper-level officials of the Empire, such as [[Pargal\u0131 \u0130brahim Pasha]] and [[Sokollu Mehmet Pa\u015fa]], were recruited in this way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Bernard Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher= Chapter readings for class at Fordham University }}</ref> By 1609, the Sultan's ''Kap\u0131kulu'' forces increased to about 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |title=In the Service of the State and Military Class }}</ref>\n\nIn later years, Sultans turned to the [[Barbary Pirates]] to supply their Jannissaries corps. Their attacks on ships off the coast of Africa or in the Mediterranean, and subsequent capture of able-bodied men for ransom or sale provided some captives for the Sultan's system. Starting in the 17th century, Christian families living under the Ottoman rule began to submit their sons into the Kapikulu system willingly, as they saw this as a potentially invaluable career opportunity for their children. Eventually the Sultan turned to foreign volunteers from the warrior clans of [[Circassians]] in southern Russia to fill his Janissary armies. As a whole the system began to break down, the loyalty of the Jannissaries became increasingly suspect. [[Mahmud II]] forcibly disbanded the Janissary corps in 1826.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-300350/Janissary |title= Janissary corps, or Janizary, or Yeni\u00e7eri (Turkish military)|publisher=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/janissaries.htm|title=Janissaries \u2013 LookLex Encyclopaedia|author=Tore Kjeilen|work=i-cias.com}}</ref>\n\nSimilar to the Janissaries in origin and means of development were the Mamluks of Egypt in the [[Middle Ages]]. The [[Mamluks]] were usually captive non-Muslim Iranian and Turkish children who had been kidnapped or bought as slaves from the Barbary coasts. The Egyptians assimilated and trained the boys and young men to become Islamic soldiers who served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first mamluks served the [[Abbasid]] caliphs in 9th-century [[Baghdad]]. Over time they became a powerful military [[caste]]. On more than one occasion, they seized power, for example, ruling [[Egypt]] from 1250\u20131517.\n\nFrom 1250 [[Egypt]] had been ruled by the [[Bahri dynasty]] of [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] origin. Slaves from the [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] served in the army and formed an elite corp of troops. They eventually revolted in Egypt to form the [[Burgi dynasty]]. The Mamluks' excellent fighting abilities, massed Islamic armies, and overwhelming numbers succeeded in overcoming the Christian [[Crusades|Crusader]] fortresses in the Holy Land. The Mamluks were the most successful defense against the [[Ilkhanate|Mongol Ilkhanate]] of Persia and Iraq from entering Egypt.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sunnahonline.com/ilm/seerah/0075_popup11.htm |title=The Mamluk (Slave) Dynasty (Timeline) |newspaper=Sunnah Online }}</ref>\n\nOn the western coast of Africa, Berber Muslims captured non-Muslims to put to work as laborers. They generally converted the younger people to Islam and many became quite assimilated. In Morocco, the Berber looked south rather than north. The Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]], called  \"the Bloodthirsty\" (1672\u20131727), employed a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]]. He used them to coerce the country into submission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |author=Lewis |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 1994 }}</ref>\n\n===In modern times===\n[[File:Branka 1863.JPG|thumb|left|Conscription of Poles to the Russian Army in 1863 (by [[Aleksander Sochaczewski]]).]]\n{{see also|Remplacement}}\nModern conscription, the massed military enlistment of national citizens, was devised during the [[French Revolution]], to enable the [[French First Republic|Republic]] to defend itself from the attacks of European monarchies. Deputy [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]] gave its name to the 5 September 1798 Act, whose first article stated: \"Any Frenchman is a soldier and owes himself to the defense of the nation.\"  It enabled the creation of the ''[[Grande Arm\u00e9e]]'', what [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] called \"the nation in arms\", which overwhelmed European professional armies that often numbered only into the low tens of thousands.

The Prussians were used to relying on superior organization and tactical factors such as order of battle to focus superior troops against inferior ones. Given approximately equivalent forces, as was generally the case with professional armies, these factors showed considerable importance. However, they became considerably less important when the Prussian armies faced forces that outnumbered their own in some cases by more than ten to one. [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]] advocated adopting the ''[[lev\u00e9e en masse]]'', the military conscription used by France. The ''Kr\u00fcmpersystem'' was the beginning of short-term compulsory service in Prussia, as opposed to the long-term conscription previously used.<ref>Dierk Walter.

Compared to these extensive costs, some would argue there is very little benefit; if there ever was a war then conscription and basic training could be completed quickly, and in any case there is little threat of a war in most countries with conscription. In the United States, every male resident is required by law to register with the [[Selective Service System]] within 30 days following his 18th birthday and be available for a draft; this is often accomplished automatically by a motor vehicle department during licensing or by voter registration).\n\nThe cost of conscription can be related to the [[parable of the broken window]] in anti-draft arguments. The cost of the work, military service, does not disappear even if no salary is paid. The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted, as an unwilling workforce is extremely inefficient. The impact is especially severe in wartime, when civilian professionals are forced to fight as amateur soldiers. Not only is the work effort of the conscripts wasted and productivity lost, but professionally skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce. Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military. This may be less a problem in an agrarian or pre-industrialized state where the level of education is generally low, and where a worker is easily replaced by another. However, this is potentially more costly in a [[post-industrial society]] where educational levels are high and where the workforce is sophisticated and a replacement for a conscripted specialist is difficult to find. Even direr economic consequences result if the professional conscripted as an amateur soldier is killed or maimed for life; his work effort and productivity are lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2136&chapter=195469&layout=html&Itemid=27#c_NIR_1360-016_footnote_nt1046 |title=Why Not a Volunteer Army? |accessdate=September 11, 2008 |author=[[Milton Friedman]] |year=1967 |work=New Individualist Review}}</ref>\n\n==Arguments in favor of conscription==\n\n===Political and moral motives===\n{{Further|Social contract|Social solidarity|Active citizenship}}\n[[File:Conscription in Iran 3.jpg|thumb|left|Conscription in [[Iran]]]]\n\n[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] argued vehemently against professional armies, feeling it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society and a mark of moral decline to leave this business to professionals.

Civilian service may take place in the Civilian Service Center in [[Lapinj\u00e4rvi (municipality)|Lapinj\u00e4rvi]] or in an accepted non-profit organization of educational, social or medical nature.\n\n====Germany====\n{{main|Conscription in Germany}}\nIn both [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]], military service was mandatory for all male citizens. With the end of the [[Cold War]], then [[German reunification|reunified Germany]] drastically reduced the size of its [[Bundeswehr|armed forces]]. The low demand for conscripts led to the suspension of compulsory conscription in 2011. Since then only volunteer professionals serve in the Bundeswehr.\n\n====Greece====\n{{update|date=March 2017}}\n{{main|Conscription in Greece}}\n[[File:Changing of the Guard-Unknown Soldier-Hellenic Army.jpg|thumb|[[Evzones]] of the [[Evzones|Presidential Guard]] in front of the [[Greek Parliament]] armed with M1 Garands.]]\nSince 1914, [[Greece]] has had a period of mandatory [[military]] service lasting 9 months for men between the ages of 16 and 45. Citizens discharged from active service are normally placed in the reserve and are subject to periodic recalls of 1\u201310 days at irregular intervals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105224001/http://www.stratologia.gr/pdf/N.3421-2005.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-05 |df= }}</ref>\n\nUniversal conscription was introduced in Greece during the military reforms of 1909, although various forms of selective conscription had been in place earlier. In more recent years, conscription was associated with the state of general mobilisation declared on July 20, 1974 due to the crisis in [[Cyprus]] (the mobilisation was formally ended on December 18, 2002).\n\nThe period of time that a conscript is required to serve has varied historically, between 12\u201336 months depending on various factors particular to the conscript, and the political situation. Although women are accepted into the Greek army on a voluntary basis, they are not required to enlist, as men are. Soldiers receive no health insurance, but they are provided medical support during their army service, including hospitalization costs.\n\nSince 2009, [[Greece]] has mandatory military service of 9 months for male citizens between the ages of 19 and 45. However, as the Armed forces had been gearing towards a completely professional army, the government had announced that the mandatory military service period would be cut to 6 months by 2008 or even abolished completely. However, this timetable was under reconsideration as of April 2006, due to severe manpower shortages. These had been caused by a combination of financial difficulties, meaning that professional soldiers could not be hired at the projected rate, and widespread [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930030615/http://news.kathimerini.gr/4dcgi/_w_articles_politics_935936_14/08/2005_153317 abuse] of the deferment process, resulting in two thirds of the conscripts deferred service in 2005. In August 2009, the mandatory service period was reduced to 9 months for the army, but has remained at 12 months for the navy and the air force. The number of conscripts affected to the latter two has been greatly reduced, with an aim towards full professionalisation.\n\n====Lithuania====\n{{main|Conscription in Lithuania}}\nLithuania abolished its conscription in 2008.<ref>https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/02/24/litauen-aterinfor-allman-varnplikt</ref> In May 2015 the Lithuanian parliament voted to return the conscription and the conscripts started their training in August 2015.<ref>https://svenska.yle.fi/artikel/2015/08/25/varnplikten-ar-tillbaka-i-litauen-hard-konkurrens-om-platserna</ref> In practice there is no conscription in Lithuania, since all recruits have been volunteers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/lithuania_publishes_2016_conscription_lists/|title=Lithuania publishes 2016 conscription lists|website=www.baltictimes.com}}</ref>\n\n====Moldova====\n[[Moldova]], which currently has male conscription, has announced plans to abolish the practice.

[[Napoleon]]'s brother [[Louis Bonaparte]], who was [[King of Holland]] from 1806 to 1810, had tried to introduce conscription a few years earlier, unsuccessfully. Every man aged 20 years or older had to enlist. By means of drawing lots it was decided who had to undertake service in the French army. It was possible to arrange a substitute against payment.\n\nLater on, conscription was used for all men over the age of 18. Postponement was possible, due to study, for example. Conscientious objectors could perform an alternative civilian service instead of military service. For various reasons, this forced military service was criticized at the end of the twentieth century. Since the Cold War was over, so was the direct threat of a war. Instead, the Dutch army was employed in more and more peacekeeping operations. The complexity and danger of these missions made the use of conscripts controversial. Furthermore, the conscription system was thought to be unfair as only men were drafted.\n\nIn the European part of Netherlands, compulsory attendance has been officially suspended since 1 May 1997. Between 1991 and 1996, the Dutch armed forces phased out their conscript personnel and converted to an all-professional force. The last conscript troops were inducted in 1995, and demobilized in 1996. The suspension means that citizens are no longer forced to serve in the armed forces, as long as it is not required for the safety of the country. Until then, the Dutch army has become an all-professional force. However, to this day, every male and female<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2016/02/02/kaderwet-dienstplicht-wordt-aangepast-voor-vrouwen|title=Kaderwet dienstplicht wordt aangepast voor vrouwen|first=Ministerie van|last=Defensie|work=rijksoverheid.nl|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> citizen aged 17 gets a letter in which they are told that they have been registered but do not have to present themselves for service.

The cervix is usually 2 to 3&nbsp;cm long (~1 inch) and roughly cylindrical in shape, which changes during [[pregnancy]]. The narrow, central [[cervical canal]] runs along its entire length, connecting the [[uterine cavity]] and the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the [[vagina]]. The opening into the uterus is called the [[Internal orifice of the uterus|internal os]], and the opening into the vagina is called the [[external os]]. The lower part of the cervix, known as the vaginal portion of the cervix (or ectocervix), bulges into the top of the vagina. The cervix has been documented anatomically since at least the time of [[Hippocrates]], over 2,000 years ago.\n\nThe cervical canal is a passage through which [[sperm]] must travel to fertilize an [[egg cell]] after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including [[cervical cap]]s and [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|cervical diaphragm]]s, aim to block or prevent the passage of sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the [[Creighton model]] and [[Billings method]], due to its changes in consistency throughout the [[menstrual period]]. During vaginal [[childbirth]], the cervix must flatten and [[Cervical dilation|dilate]] to allow the [[fetus]] to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use the extent of the dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.\n\nThe cervical canal is lined with a single [[columnar epithelia|layer of column-shaped cells]], while the ectocervix is covered with [[stratified squamous|multiple layers of cells topped with flat cells]]. The two types of [[epithelium|epithelia]] meet the squamocolumnar junction. Infection with the [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) can cause changes in the epithelium, which can lead to [[cancer of the cervix]]. [[Exfoliative cervical cytology|Cervical cytology]] tests can often detect cervical cancer and its precursors, and enable early successful treatment. Ways to avoid HPV include avoiding sex, using condoms, and [[HPV vaccines|HPV vaccination]].<!-- <ref name=NCI2011/> --> HPV vaccines, developed in the early 21st century, reduce the risk of cervical cancer by preventing infections from the main cancer-causing strains of HPV.<ref name=NCI2011>{{cite web |title= Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccines |url= http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/prevention/HPV-vaccine |website= National Cancer Institute |location= Bethesda, MD |date= 29 December 2011 |accessdate= 18 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\n\n[[File:Gray1167.svg|right|thumbnail|Diagram of the [[uterus]] and part of the [[vagina]].

The cervix uteri (neck of the uterus) is thus the uterine cervix, but in English the word ''cervix'' used alone usually refers to it. Thus the adjective ''cervical'' may refer either to the neck (as in ''[[cervical vertebrae]]'' or ''[[cervical lymph nodes]]'') or to the uterine cervix (as in ''[[cervical cap]]'' or ''[[cervical cancer]]'').\n\nLatin ''cervix'' came from the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root ''ker-'', referring to a \"structure that projects\".

Technically compilers are a type of [[Translator (computing)|translator]] that support digital devices, primarily computers.\n\nHowever, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled program can run on a computer whose [[Central processing unit|CPU]] or [[operating system]] is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a [[cross-compiler]]. A [[bootstrap compiler]] is written in the language that it intends to compile. A program that translates from a [[low-level language]] to a higher level one is a [[decompiler]]. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a [[source-to-source compiler]] or transpiler. A language [[rewriting|rewriter]] is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. The term [[compiler-compiler]] refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis.\n\nA compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: [[Preprocessor|preprocessing]], [[lexical analysis]], [[parsing]], [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|semantic analysis]] ([[syntax-directed translation]]), conversion of input programs to an [[intermediate representation]], [[code optimization]] and [[code generation (compiler)|code generation]]. Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient design and correct transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure [[compiler correctness]].<ref name=Sun2016>{{cite web |last1=Sun|first1=Chengnian|last2=Le|first2=Vu|last3=Zhang|first3=Qirun|last4=Su|first4=Zhendong|date=2016|title=Toward Understanding Compiler Bugs in GCC and LLVM|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2931037.2931074|journal=ACM}}</ref>\n\nCompilers are not the only translators used to transform source programs. An [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] is computer software that transforms and then executes the indicated operations. The translation process influences the design of computer languages which leads to a preference of compilation or interpretation. In practice, an interpreter can be implemented for compiled languages and compilers can be implemented for interpreted languages.\n\n== History ==\n{{main article|History of compiler construction}}\n[[File:Compiler.svg|right|thumb|300px|A diagram of the operation of a typical multi-language, multi-target compiler]]\nTheoretical computing concepts developed by scientists, mathematicians, and engineers formed the basis of digital modern computing development during World War II. Primitive binary languages evolved because digital devices only understand ones and zeros and the circuit patterns in the underlying machine architecture. In the late 1940s, assembly languages were created to offer a more workable abstraction of the computer architectures. Limited [[main memory|memory]] capacity of early computers led to substantial technical challenges when the first compilers were designed. Therefore, the compilation process needed to be divided into several small programs. The front end programs produce the analysis products used by the back end programs to generate target code. As computer technology provided more resources, compiler designs could align better with the compilation process.\n\nThe human mind can design better solutions as the language moves from the machine to a higher level. So the development of high-level languages followed naturally from the capabilities offered by the digital computers. High-level languages are [[formal language]]s that are strictly defined by their syntax and semantics which form the high-level language architecture. Elements of these formal languages include:\n* ''Alphabet'', any finite set of symbols;\n* ''String'', a finite sequence of symbols;\n* ''Language'', any set of strings on an alphabet.\n\nThe sentences in a language may be defined by a set of rules called a grammar.<ref>lecture notes\nCompilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools\nJing-Shin Chang\nDepartment of Computer Science & Information Engineering\nNational Chi-Nan University</ref>\n\n[[Backus-Naur form]] (BNF) describes the syntax of \"sentences\" of a language and was used for the syntax of Algol 60 by [[John Backus]].<ref>Naur, P. et al.

Corbat\u00f3|Fernando Corbat\u00f3]] from MIT.<ref>Corabato/Vyssotsky \"Introduction and Overview of the MULTICS System\" FJCC 1965</ref> Multics was written in the [[PL/I]] language developed by IBM and IBM User Group.<ref>Report II of the SHARE Advanced Language Development Committee, 25 June 1964</ref> IBM's goal was to satisfy business, scientific, and systems programming requirements. There were other languages that could have been considered but PL/I offered the most complete solution even though it had not been implemented.<ref>Multicians.org \"The Choice of PL/I\" article, Editor /tom Van Vleck</ref> For the first few years of the Mulitics project, a subset of the language could be compiled to assembly language with the Early PL/I (EPL) compiler by Doug McIlory and Bob Morris from Bell Labs.<ref>\"PL/I As a Tool for System Programming\", F.J.

Freiburghouse, GE, Fall Joint Computer Conference 1969</ref>\n\nBell Labs left the Multics project in 1969: \"Over time, hope was replaced by frustration as the group effort initially failed to produce an economically useful system.\"<ref>[[Datamation]] column, 1969</ref> Continued participation would drive up project support costs. So researchers turned to other development efforts. A system programming language [[B (programming language)|B]] based on BCPL concepts was written by [[Dennis Ritchie]] and [[Ken Thompson]]. Ritchie created a boot-strapping compiler for B and wrote [[Unix|Unics]] (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) operating system for a PDP-7 in B. Unics eventually became spelled Unix.\n\nBell Labs started development and expansion of [[C (programming language)|C]] based on B and BCPL. The BCPL compiler had been transported to Multics by Bell Labs and BCPL was a preferred language at Bell Labs.<ref>Dennis M. Ritchie, \"The Development of the C Language\", ACM Second History of Programming Languages Conference, April, 1993</ref> Initially, a front-end program to Bell Labs' B compiler was used while a C compiler was developed. In 1971, a new PDP-11 provided the resource to define extensions to B and rewrite the compiler. By 1973 the design of C language was essentially complete and the Unix kernel for a PDP-11 was rewritten in C. Steve Johnson started development of Portable C Compiler (PCC) to support retargeting of C compilers to new machines.<ref>S.C. Johnson, \"a Portable C Compiler: Theory and Practice\", 5th ACM POPL Symposium, January 1978</ref><ref>A. Snyder, A Portable Compiler for the Language C, MIT, 1974.</ref>\n\n[[Object-oriented programming]] (OOP) offered some interesting possibilities for application development and maintenance. OOP concepts go further back but were part of [[LISP]] and [[Simula]] language science.<ref>K. Nygarard, University of Oslo, Norway, \"Basic Concepts in Object Oriented Programming\", SIGPLAN Notices V21, 1986</ref> At Bell Labs, the development of [[C++]] became interested in OOP.<ref>B. Stroustrup: \"What is Object-Oriented Programming?\" Proceedings 14th ASU Conference, 1986.</ref> C++ was first used in 1980 for systems programming. The initial design leveraged C language systems programming capabilities with Simula concepts. Object-oriented facilities were added in 1983.<ref>Bjarne Stroustrup, \"An Overview of the C++ Programming Language\", Handbook of Object Technology (Editor: Saba Zamir, {{ISBN|0-8493-3135-8}})</ref> The Cfront program implemented a C++ front-end for C84 language compiler. In subsequent years several C++ compilers were developed as C++ popularity grew.\n\nIn many application domains, the idea of using a higher-level language quickly caught on. Because of the expanding functionality supported by newer [[programming language]]s and the increasing complexity of computer architectures, compilers became more complex.\n\n[[DARPA]] (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) sponsored a compiler project with Wulf's CMU research team in 1970. The Production Quality Compiler-Compiler [[PQCC]] design would produce a Production Quality Compiler (PQC) from formal definitions of source language and the target.<ref>Leverett, Cattell, Hobbs, Newcomer, Reiner, Schatz, Wulf: \"An Overview of the Production Quality Compiler-Compiler Project\", CMU-CS-89-105, 1979</ref> PQCC tried to extend the term compiler-compiler beyond the traditional meaning as a parser generator (e.g., [[Yacc]]) without much success. PQCC might more properly be referred to as a compiler generator.\n\nPQCC research into code generation process sought to build a truly automatic compiler-writing system. The effort discovered and designed the phase structure of the PQC. The BLISS-11 compiler provided the initial structure.<ref>W. Wulf, K. Nori, \"Delayed binding in PQCC generated compilers\", CMU Research Showcase Report, CMU-CS-82-138, 1982\n</ref> The phases included analyses (front end), intermediate translation to virtual machine (middle end), and translation to the target (back end). TCOL was developed for the PQCC research to handle language specific constructs in the intermediate representation.<ref>Joseph M. Newcomer, David Alex Lamb, Bruce W. Leverett, Michael Tighe, William A. Wulf - Carnegie-Mellon University and David Levine, Andrew H. Reinerit - Intermetrics: \"TCOL Ada: Revised Report on An Intermediate Representation for the DOD Standard Programming Language\", 1979\n</ref> Variations of TCOL supported various languages. The PQCC project investigated techniques of automated compiler construction. The design concepts proved useful in optimizing compilers and compilers for the object-oriented programming language [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]].\n\nThe Ada Stoneman Document formalized the program support environment (APSE) along with the kernel (KAPSE) and minimal (MAPSE). An Ada interpreter NYU/ED supported development and standardization efforts with American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO). Initial Ada compiler development by the U.S. Military Services included the compilers in a complete integrated design environment along the lines of the Stoneman Document. Army and Navy worked on the Ada Language System (ALS) project targeted to DEC/VAX architecture while the Air Force started on the Ada Integrated Environment (AIE) targeted to IBM 370 series. While the projects did not provide the desired results, they did contribute to the overal effort on Ada development.<ref>William A. Whitaker, \"Ada - the project: the DoD High Order Working Group\", ACM SIGPLAN Notices (Volume 28, No. 3, March 1991)</ref>\n\nOther Ada compiler efforts got under way in Britain at University of York and in Germany at University of Karlsruhe. In the U. S., Verdix (later acquired by Rational) delivered the Verdix Ada Development System (VADS) to the Army. VADS provided a set of development tools including a compiler. Unix/VADS could be hosted on a variety of Unix platforms such as DEC Ultrix and the Sun 3/60 Solaris targeted to Motorola 68020 in an Army CECOM evaluation.<ref>CECOM Center for Software Engineering Advanced Software Technology, \"Final Report - Evaluation of the ACEC Benchmark Suite for Real-Time Applications\", AD-A231 968, 1990</ref> There were soon many Ada compilers available that passed the Ada Validation tests. The Free Software Foundation GNU project developed the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) which provides a core capability to support multiple languages and targets. The Ada version [[GNAT]] is one of the most widely used Ada compilers. GNAT is free but there is also commercial support, for example, AdaCore, was founded in 1994 to provide commercial software solutions for Ada. GNAT Pro includes the GNU GCC based GNAT with a tool suite to provide an [[integrated development environment]].\n\nHigh-level languages continued to drive compiler research and development. Focus areas included optimization and automatic code generation. Trends in programming languages and development environments influenced compiler technology. More compilers became included in language distributions (PERL, Java Development Kit) and as a component of an IDE (VADS, Eclipse, Ada Pro). The interrelationship and interdependence of technologies grew. The advent of web services promoted growth of web languages and scripting languages. Scripts trace back to the early days of Command Line Interfaces (CLI) where the user could enter commands to be executed by the system. User Shell concepts developed with languages to write shell programs. Early Windows designs offered a simple batch programming capability. The conventional transformation of these language used an interpreter. While not widely used, Bash and Batch compilers have been written. More recently sophisticated interpreted languages became part of the developers tool kit. Modern scripting languages include PHP, Python, Ruby and Lua. (Lua is widely used in game development.) All of these have interpreter and compiler support.<ref>P.Biggar, E. de Vries, D. Gregg, \"A Practical Solution for Scripting Language Compilers\", submission to Science of Computer Programming, 2009</ref>\n\n\"When the field of compiling began in the late 50s, its focus was limited to the translation of high-level language programs into machine code ... The compiler field is increasingly intertwined with other disciplines including computer architecture, programming languages, formal methods, software engineering, and computer security.\"<ref>M.Hall, D. Padua, K. Pingali, \"Compiler Research: The Next 50 Years\", ACM Communications 2009 Vol 54 #2</ref> The \"Compiler Research: The Next 50 Years\" article noted the importance of object-oriented languages and Java. Security and parallel computing were cited among the future research targets.\n\n== Compiler construction ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}\nA compiler implements a formal transformation from a high-level source program to a low-level target program. Compiler design can define an end to end solution or tackle a defined subset that interfaces with other compilation tools e.g. preprocessors, assemblers, linkers. Design requirements include rigorously defined interfaces both internally between compiler components and externally between supporting toolsets.\n\nIn the early days, the approach taken to compiler design was directly affected by the complexity of the computer language to be processed, the experience of the person(s) designing it, and the resources available. Resource limitations led to the need to pass through the source code more than once.\n\nA compiler for a relatively simple language written by one person might be a single, monolithic piece of software. However, as the source language grows in complexity the design may be split into a number of interdependent phases. Separate phases provide design improvements that focus development on the functions in the compilation process.\n\n=== One-pass versus multi-pass compilers{{anchor|Single-pass}} ===\nClassifying compilers by number of passes has its background in the hardware resource limitations of computers. Compiling involves performing lots of work and early computers did not have enough memory to contain one program that did all of this work. So compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made a pass over the source (or some representation of it) performing some of the required analysis and translations.\n\nThe ability to compile in a [[one-pass compiler|single pass]] has classically been seen as a benefit because it simplifies the job of writing a compiler and one-pass compilers generally perform compilations faster than [[multi-pass compiler]]s. Thus, partly driven by the resource limitations of early systems, many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled in a single pass (e.g., [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]).\n\nIn some cases the design of a language feature may require a compiler to perform more than one pass over the source. For instance, consider a declaration appearing on line 20 of the source which affects the translation of a statement appearing on line 10. In this case, the first pass needs to gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect, with the actual translation happening during a subsequent pass.\n\nThe disadvantage of compiling in a single pass is that it is not possible to perform many of the sophisticated [[compiler optimization|optimizations]] needed to generate high quality code. It can be difficult to count exactly how many passes an optimizing compiler makes. For instance, different phases of optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once.\n\nSplitting a compiler up into small programs is a technique used by researchers interested in producing provably correct compilers. Proving the correctness of a set of small programs often requires less effort than proving the correctness of a larger, single, equivalent program.\n\n=== Three-stage compiler structure ===\n[[File:Compiler design.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.5|Compiler design]]\nRegardless of the exact number of phases in the compiler design, the phases can be assigned to one of three stages. The stages include a front end, a middle end, and a back end.\n* The ''front end'' verifies syntax and semantics according to a specific source language. For [[Type system|statically typed languages]] it performs [[type checking]] by collecting type information. If the input program is syntactically incorrect or has a type error, it generates errors and warnings, highlighting{{dubious|date=January 2017}} them on the source code. Aspects of the front end include lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The front end transforms the input program into an [[intermediate representation]] (IR) for further processing by the middle end. This IR is usually a lower-level representation of the program with respect to the source code.\n* The ''middle end'' performs optimizations on the IR that are independent of the CPU architecture being targeted. This source code/machine code independence is intended to enable generic optimizations to be shared between versions of the compiler supporting different languages and target processors. Examples of middle end optimizations are removal of useless ([[dead code elimination]]) or unreachable code ([[reachability analysis]]), discovery and propagation of constant values ([[constant propagation]]), relocation of computation to a less frequently executed place (e.g., out of a loop), or specialization of computation based on the context. Eventually producing the \"optimized\" IR that is used by the back end.\n* The ''back end'' takes the optimized IR from the middle end. It may perform more analysis, transformations and optimizations that are specific for the target CPU architecture. The back end generates the target-dependent assembly code, performing [[register allocation]] in the process. The back end performs [[instruction scheduling]], which re-orders instructions to keep parallel [[execution unit]]s busy by filling [[delay slot]]s. Although most algorithms for optimization are [[NP-hardness|NP-hard]], [[Heuristic (computer science)|heuristic]] techniques are well-developed and currently implemented in production-quality compilers. Typically the output of a back end is machine code specialized for a particular processor and operating system.\n\nThis front/middle/back-end approach makes it possible to combine front ends for different languages with back ends for different [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] while sharing the optimizations of the middle end.<ref>Cooper and Torczon 2012, p. 8</ref> Practical examples of this approach are the [[GNU Compiler Collection]], [[LLVM]],<ref name=LattnerBook1st>{{cite book | author = Lattner, Chris | editors = Brown, Amy & Wilson, Greg | date = 2017 | chapter = LLVM | title = The Architecture of Open Source Applications | url = http://www.aosabook.org/en/llvm.html | accessdate = 28 February 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161202070941/http://aosabook.org/en/llvm.html | archivedate = 2 December 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> and the [[Amsterdam Compiler Kit]], which have multiple front-ends, shared optimizations and multiple back-ends.\n\n=== Front end ===\n[[File:Xxx Scanner and parser example for C.gif|thumb|right|400px|[[Lexical analysis|Lexer]] and [[Parsing|parser]] example for [[C (programming language)|C]]. Starting from the sequence of characters \"<code>if(net>0.0)total+=net*(1.0+tax/100.0);</code>\", the scanner composes a sequence of [[Lexical analysis#token|tokens]], and categorizes each of them, for example as {{color|#600000|identifier}}, {{color|#606000|reserved word}}, {{color|#006000|number literal}}, or {{color|#000060|operator}}. The latter sequence is transformed by the parser into a [[abstract syntax tree|syntax tree]], which is then treated by the remaining compiler phases. The scanner and parser handles the [[regular grammar|regular]] and properly [[context-free grammar|context-free]] parts of the [[C syntax#External links|grammar for C]], respectively.]]\n\nThe front end analyzes the source code to build an internal representation of the program, called the [[intermediate representation]] (IR). It also manages the [[symbol table]], a data structure mapping each symbol in the source code to associated information such as location, type and scope.\n\nWhile the frontend can be a single monolithic function or program, as in a [[scannerless parser]], it is more commonly implemented and analyzed as several phases, which may execute sequentially or concurrently. This method is favored due to its modularity and [[separation of concerns]]. Most commonly today, the frontend is broken into three phases: [[lexical analysis]] (also known as lexing), [[syntax analysis]] (also known as scanning or parsing), and [[Semantic analysis (compilers)|semantic analysis]]. Lexing and parsing comprise the syntactic analysis (word syntax and phrase syntax, respectively), and in simple cases these modules (the lexer and parser) can be automatically generated from a grammar for the language, though in more complex cases these require manual modification. The lexical grammar and phrase grammar are usually [[context-free grammar]]s, which simplifies analysis significantly, with context-sensitivity handled at the semantic analysis phase. The semantic analysis phase is generally more complex and written by hand, but can be partially or fully automated using [[attribute grammar]]s. These phases themselves can be further broken down: lexing as scanning and evaluating, and parsing as building a [[Parse tree|concrete syntax tree]] (CST, parse tree) and then transforming it into an [[abstract syntax tree]] (AST, syntax tree). In some cases additional phases are used, notably ''line reconstruction'' and ''preprocessing,'' but these are rare.\n\nThe main phases of the front end include the following:\n* ''Line reconstruction'' converts the input character sequence to a canonical form ready for the parser. Languages which [[stropping (syntax)|strop]] their keywords or allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require this phase. The [[top-down parsing|top-down]], [[recursive descent parser|recursive-descent]], table-driven parsers used in the 1960s typically read the source one character at a time and did not require a separate tokenizing phase. [[Atlas Autocode]], and [[Edinburgh IMP|Imp]] (and some implementations of [[ALGOL]] and [[Coral 66]]) are examples of stropped languages which compilers would have a ''Line Reconstruction'' phase.\n* ''[[Preprocessor|Preprocessing]]'' supports [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] substitution and conditional compilation. Typically the preprocessing phase occurs before syntactic or semantic analysis; e.g. in the case of C, the preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather than syntactic forms. However, some languages such as [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]] support macro substitutions based on syntactic forms.\n* ''[[Lexical analysis]]'' (also known as ''lexing'' or ''tokenization'') breaks the source code text into a sequence of small pieces called ''lexical tokens''.<ref>Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman 2007, p. 5-6, 109-189</ref> This phase can be divided into two stages: the ''scanning'', which segments the input text into syntactic units called ''lexemes'' and assign them a category; and the ''evaluating'', which converts lexemes into a processed value. A token is a pair consisting of a ''token name'' and an optional ''token value''.<ref>Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman 2007, p. 111</ref> Common token categories may include identifiers, keywords, separators, operators, literals and comments, although the set of token categories varies in different [[programming language]]s. The lexeme syntax is typically a [[regular language]], so a [[finite state automaton]] constructed from a [[regular expression]] can be used to recognize it. The software doing lexical analysis is called a [[lexical analyzer]]. This may not be a separate step\u2014it can be combined with the parsing step in [[scannerless parsing]], in which case parsing is done at the character level, not the token level.\n* ''[[Syntax analysis]]'' (also known as ''parsing'') involves [[parsing]] the token sequence to identify the syntactic structure of the program. This phase typically builds a [[parse tree]], which replaces the linear sequence of tokens with a tree structure built according to the rules of a [[formal grammar]] which define the language's syntax. The parse tree is often analyzed, augmented, and transformed by later phases in the compiler.<ref>Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman 2007, p. 8, 191-300</ref>\n* ''[[Semantic analysis (compilers)|Semantic analysis]]'' adds semantic information to the [[parse tree]] and builds the [[symbol table]]. This phase performs semantic checks such as [[type checking]] (checking for type errors), or [[object binding]] (associating variable and function references with their definitions), or [[definite assignment analysis|definite assignment]] (requiring all local variables to be initialized before use), rejecting incorrect programs or issuing warnings. Semantic analysis usually requires a complete parse tree, meaning that this phase logically follows the [[parsing]] phase, and logically precedes the [[code generation (compiler)|code generation]] phase, though it is often possible to fold multiple phases into one pass over the code in a compiler implementation.\n\n=== Middle end ===\nThe middle end performs optimizations on the intermediate representation in order to improve the performance and the quality of the produced machine code.<ref>Aho, Lam, Sethi, Ullman 2007, p. 10, 583-703</ref> The middle end contains those optimizations that are independent of the CPU architecture being targeted.\n\nThe main phases of the middle end include the following:\n* [[Compiler analysis|Analysis]]: This is the gathering of program information from the intermediate representation derived from the input; [[data-flow analysis]] is used to build [[use-define chain]]s, together with [[dependence analysis]], [[alias analysis]], [[pointer analysis]], [[escape analysis]], etc. Accurate analysis is the basis for any compiler optimization. The [[control flow graph]] of every compiled function and the [[call graph]] of the program  are usually also built during the analysis phase.\n* [[Compiler optimization|Optimization]]: the intermediate language representation is transformed into functionally equivalent but faster (or smaller) forms. Popular optimizations are [[inline expansion]], [[dead code elimination]], [[constant propagation]], [[loop transformation]] and even [[automatic parallelization]].\nCompiler analysis is the prerequisite for any compiler optimization, and they tightly work together. For example, [[dependence analysis]] is crucial for [[loop transformation]].\n\nThe scope of compiler analysis and optimizations vary greatly, from as small as a [[basic block]] to the procedure/function level, or even over the whole program ([[interprocedural optimization]]). Obviously,{{clarify|date=November 2015}} a compiler can potentially do a better job using a broader view. But that broad view is not free: large scope analysis and optimizations are very costly in terms of compilation time and memory space; this is especially true for interprocedural analysis and optimizations.\n\nInterprocedural analysis and optimizations are common in modern commercial compilers from [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]], [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]], [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Sun Microsystems]]. The [[free software|free software]] [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] was criticized for a long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations, but it is changing in this respect. Another open source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is [[Open64]], which is used by many organizations for research and commercial purposes.\n\nDue to the extra time and space needed for compiler analysis and optimizations, some compilers skip them by default. Users have to use compilation options to explicitly tell the compiler which optimizations should be enabled.\n\n=== Back end ===\nThe back end is responsible for the CPU architecture specific optimizations and for [[code generation (compiler)|code generation]]''.''\n\nThe main phases of the back end include the following:\n* ''Machine dependent optimizations'': optimizations that depend on the details of the CPU architecture that the compiler targets.<ref>Cooper and Toczon (2012), p. 540</ref> A prominent example is [[peephole optimization]]s, which rewrites short sequences of assembler instructions into more efficient instructions.\n* ''[[Code generation (compiler)|Code generation]]'': the transformed intermediate language is translated into the output language, usually the native [[machine language]] of the system. This involves resource and storage decisions, such as deciding which variables to fit into [[Register allocation|registers]] and memory and the [[Instruction selection|selection]] and [[Instruction scheduling|scheduling]] of appropriate machine instructions along with their associated [[addressing mode]]s (see also [[Sethi-Ullman algorithm]]). Debug data may also need to be generated to facilitate [[debugging]].\n\n=== Compiler correctness ===\n{{Main article|Compiler correctness}}\n[[Compiler correctness]] is the branch of software engineering that deals with trying to show that a compiler behaves according to its [[programming language|language specification]].<ref>{{cite web | author=Chlipala, Adam | date= | title=Syntactic Proofs of Compositional Compiler Correctness | format=manuscript draft, publication date unknown | via=Adam.Chlipala.net | url=http://adam.chlipala.net/tmp/compose.pdf | accessdate=28 February 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829181746/http://adam.chlipala.net/tmp/compose.pdf | archivedate=29 August 2017 | df=dmy-all }}{{self-published inline|date=March 2017}}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=March 2017}}{{primary source inline|date=March 2017}} Techniques include developing the compiler using [[formal methods]] and using rigorous testing (often called compiler validation) on an existing compiler.\n\n== Compiled versus interpreted languages ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}\nHigher-level programming languages usually appear with a type of [[Translator (computing)|translation]] in mind: either designed as [[compiled language]] or [[interpreted language]]. However, in practice there is rarely anything about a language that ''requires'' it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted, although it is possible to design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time. The categorization usually reflects the most popular or widespread implementations of a language \u2014 for instance, [[BASIC]] is sometimes called an interpreted language, and C a compiled one, despite the existence of BASIC compilers and C interpreters.\n\nInterpretation does not replace compilation completely. It only hides it from the user and makes it gradual. Even though an interpreter can itself be interpreted, a directly executed program is needed somewhere at the bottom of the stack (see [[machine language]]).\n\nFurther, compilers can contain interpreters for optimization reasons. For example, where an expression can be executed during compilation and the results inserted into the output program, then it prevents it having to be recalculated each time the program runs, which can greatly speed up the final program. Modern trends toward [[just-in-time compilation]] and [[bytecode|bytecode interpretation]] at times blur the traditional categorizations of compilers and interpreters even further.\n\nSome language specifications spell out that implementations ''must'' include a compilation facility; for example, [[Common Lisp]]. However, there is nothing inherent in the definition of Common Lisp that stops it from being interpreted. Other languages have features that are very easy to implement in an interpreter, but make writing a compiler much harder; for example, [[APL (programming language)|APL]], [[SNOBOL4]], and many scripting languages allow programs to construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations, and then execute that code by passing it to a special [[eval|evaluation function]]. To implement these features in a compiled language, programs must usually be shipped with a [[runtime library]] that includes a version of the compiler itself.\n\n== Types ==\nOne classification of compilers is by the [[platform (computing)|platform]] on which their generated code executes. This is known as the ''target platform.''\n\nA ''native'' or ''hosted'' compiler is one whose output is intended to directly run on the same type of computer and operating system that the compiler itself runs on. The output of a [[cross compiler]] is designed to run on a different platform. Cross compilers are often used when developing software for [[embedded system]]s that are not intended to support a software development environment.\n\nThe output of a compiler that produces code for a [[virtual machine]] (VM) may or may not be executed on the same platform as the compiler that produced it. For this reason such compilers are not usually classified as native or cross compilers.\n\nThe lower level language that is the target of a compiler may itself be a [[high-level programming language]]. C, often viewed as some sort of portable assembler, can also be the target language of a compiler. E.g.: [[Cfront]], the original compiler for [[C++]] used C as target language. The C created by such a compiler is usually not intended to be read and maintained by humans. So [[indent style]] and pretty C intermediate code are irrelevant. Some features of C turn it into a good target language. E.g.: C code with [[C preprocessor#Special macros and directives|<code>#line</code>]] directives can be generated to support [[debugging]] of the original source.\n\nWhile a common compiler type outputs machine code, there are many other types:\n* A [[source-to-source compiler]] is a type of compiler that takes a high-level language as its input and outputs a high-level language. For example, an [[Automatic parallelization|automatic parallelizing]] compiler will frequently take in a high-level language program as an input and then transform the code and annotate it with parallel code annotations (e.g. [[OpenMP]]) or language constructs (e.g. Fortran's <code>DOALL</code> statements).\n* [[Bytecode]] compilers that compile to assembly language of a theoretical machine, like some [[Prolog]] implementations\n** This Prolog machine is also known as the [[Warren Abstract Machine]] (or WAM).\n** Bytecode compilers for [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] are also examples of this category.\n* [[Just-in-time compilation|Just-in-time compiler]] (JIT compiler) is the last part of a multi-pass compiler chain in which some compilation stages are deferred to run-time. Examples are implemented in [[Smalltalk]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and Microsoft [[.NET Framework|.NET]]'s [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL) systems.\n** Applications are first compiled using a bytecode compiler and delivered in a machine-independent [[intermediate representation]]. This bytecode is then compiled using a JIT compiler to native machine code just when the execution of the program is required.<ref>{{cite journal|authors = Aycock, John | year = 2003 | title=A Brief History of Just-in-Time|journal=ACM Comput.

The voice is produced by [[castration]] of the singer before [[puberty]], or it occurs in one who, due to an [[endocrinology|endocrinological]] condition, never reaches [[sexual maturity]].\n\nCastration before puberty (or in its early stages) prevents a boy's [[larynx]] from being transformed by the [[Voice change|normal physiological events]] of puberty. As a result, the [[vocal range]] of prepubescence (shared by both sexes) is largely retained, and the voice develops into adulthood in a unique way. Prepubescent castration for this purpose diminished greatly in the late 18th century and was made illegal in the [[Papal states]], the last to prohibit them, in 1870.\n\nAs the castrato's body grew, his lack of testosterone meant that his [[epiphyses]] (bone-joints) did not harden in the normal manner. Thus the limbs of the castrati often grew unusually long, as did the bones of their [[rib]]s. This, combined with intensive training, gave them unrivalled [[lung capacity|lung-power]] and breath capacity.<ref>[http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-jenkins_lancet.html Lancet ''The Voice of the Castrato,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611020930/http://www.usrf.org/news/010308-jenkins_lancet.html |date=11 June 2012 }} 1998; 351: pp. 1877\u201380.</ref> Operating through small, child-sized [[vocal cords]], their voices were also extraordinarily flexible, and quite different from the equivalent adult female voice. Their vocal range was higher than that of the uncastrated adult male. Listening to the only surviving recordings of a castrato (see below), one can hear that the lower part of the voice sounds like a \"super-high\" tenor, with a more [[falsetto]]-like upper register above that.\n\nCastrati were rarely referred to as such: in the 18th century, the [[euphemism]] ''[[musico]]'' (pl ''musici'') was much more generally used, although it usually carried derogatory implications;<ref>[[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]], vol 3, p. 529, sv \"musico\"</ref> another synonym was ''evirato,'' literally meaning \"[[emasculated]]\". [[Eunuch]] is a more general term since, historically, many eunuchs were castrated after puberty and thus the castration had no impact on their voices.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove-section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Byzantine castrato.jpg|thumb|upright|A Byzantine castrato from the 11th century]]\n\nCastration as a means of subjugation, enslavement or other punishment has a very long history, dating back to ancient [[Sumer]]. In a Western context, eunuch singers are known to have existed from the early [[Byzantine Empire]]. In [[Constantinople]] around 400 AD, the empress [[Aelia Eudoxia]] had a eunuch choir-master, Brison, who may have established the use of castrati in Byzantine choirs, though whether Brison himself was a singer and whether he had colleagues who were eunuch singers is not certain. By the 9th century, eunuch singers were well-known (not least in the choir of [[Hagia Sophia]]) and remained so until the sack of Constantinople by the Western forces of the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204. Their fate from then until their reappearance in Italy more than three hundred years later is not clear. It seems likely that the Spanish tradition of soprano falsettists may have hidden castrati. Much of Spain was under [[Muslim]] rulers during the Middle Ages, and castration had a history going back to the ancient Near East. Stereotypically, [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]] served as harem guards, but they were also valued as high-level political appointees since they could not start a dynasty which would threaten the ruler.\n\n==European classical tradition==\nCastrati first appeared in Italy in the mid-16th century, though at first the terms describing them were not always clear. The phrase ''soprano maschio'' (male soprano), which could also mean falsettist, occurs in the ''Due Dialoghi della Musica'' of Luigi Dentice, an Oratorian priest, published in Rome in 1553. On 9 November 1555 Cardinal [[Ippolito II d'Este]] (famed as the builder of the Villa d'Este at Tivoli), wrote to [[Guglielmo I Gonzaga|Guglielmo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] (1538\u20131587), that he has heard that His Grace is interested in his ''cantoretti'' and offered to send him two, so that he could choose one for his own service. This is a rare term but probably does equate to ''castrato''.<ref name=\"Sherr\">Sherr</ref> The Cardinal's nephew, [[Alfonso II, Duke of Ferrara|Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara]], was another early enthusiast, enquiring about castrati in 1556. There were certainly castrati in the [[Sistine Chapel]] choir in 1558, although not described as such: on 27 April of that year, Hernando Bustamante, a Spaniard from [[Palencia]], was admitted (the first castrati so termed who joined the Sistine choir were Pietro Paolo Folignato and Girolamo Rossini, admitted in 1599).<ref name=\"Sherr\"/> Surprisingly, considering the later French distaste for castrati they certainly existed in France at this time also, being known of in Paris, [[Orl\u00e9ans]], Picardy and [[Normandy]], though they were not abundant: the King of France himself had difficulty in obtaining them.<ref name=\"Sherr\"/> By 1574, there were castrati in the Ducal court chapel at [[Munich]], where the [[Kapellmeister]] (music director) was the famous [[Orlando di Lasso]]. In 1589, by the bull ''Cum pro nostro pastorali munere'', [[Pope Sixtus V]] re-organised the choir of [[St Peter's, Rome]] specifically to include castrati.<ref>Milner, Anthony. (1973). \"The Sacred Capons\". ''Musical Times'' '''114'''(1561): 250\u201352</ref> Thus the castrati came to supplant both boys (whose voices broke after only a few years) and falsettists (whose voices were weaker and less reliable) from the top line in such choirs. Women were banned by the Pauline dictum ''mulieres in ecclesiis taceant'' (\"let women keep silent in the churches\"; see I Corinthians, ch. 14, v. 34).\n\n==Opera==\n[[File:Farinelli female caricature edited.jpg|thumb|right|A caricature of Farinelli in a female role, by Pier Leone Ghezzi 1724.]]\nAlthough the castrato (or musico) predates opera, there is some evidence that castrati had parts in the earliest operas. In the first performance of [[Monteverdi]]'s ''[[L'Orfeo|Orfeo]]'' (1607), for example, they played subsidiary roles, including Speranza and (possibly) that of Euridice. Although female roles were performed by castrati in some of the papal states, this was increasingly rare; by 1680, they had supplanted \"normal\" male voices in lead roles, and retained their position as ''primo uomo'' for about a hundred years;<ref>see Heriot, A: ''The Castrati in Opera'' (London, 1956), pp. 31 ff</ref> an Italian opera not featuring at least one renowned castrato in a lead part would be doomed to fail. Because of the popularity of Italian opera throughout 18th-century Europe (except France), singers such as Ferri, [[Farinelli]], [[Senesino]] and [[Gasparo Pacchierotti|Pacchierotti]] became the first operatic superstars, earning enormous fees and hysterical public adulation.<ref>Heriot chs. 1\u20133 ''passim''</ref> The strictly hierarchical organisation of ''[[opera seria]]'' favoured their high voices as symbols of heroic virtue, though they were frequently mocked for their strange appearance and bad acting. In his 1755 ''Reflections upon theatrical expression in tragedy'', Roger Pickering wrote:\n<blockquote>Farinelli drew every Body to the Haymarket. What a Pipe! What Modulation! What Extasy to the Ear! But, Heavens! What Clumsiness! What Stupidity! What Offence to the Eye! Reader, if of the City, thou mayest probably have seen in the Fields of Islington or Mile-End or, If thou art in the environs of St James', thou must have observed in the Park with what Ease and Agility a cow, heavy with calf, has rose up at the command of the Milk-woman's foot: thus from the mossy bank sprang the DIVINE FARINELLI.<ref>Pickering, R: [https://archive.org/details/reflectionsupont00pick ''Reflections on Theatrical Expression in Tragedy''] (London, 1755), p. 63</ref></blockquote>\nThe means by which future singers were prepared could lead to premature death. To prevent the child from experiencing the intense pain of castration, many were inadvertently administered lethal doses of opium or some other narcotic, or were killed by overlong compression of the carotid artery in the neck (intended to render them unconscious during the castration procedure).<ref>such procedures are described in D'Ancillon, as translated into English by Samber, R.: ''Eunuchism Display'd ...'' (London, 1718), pp. 15\u201316</ref>\n\nDuring the 18th century itself, the music historian [[Charles Burney]] was sent from pillar to post in search of places where ''the operation'' was carried out:\n<blockquote>I enquired throughout Italy at what place boys were chiefly qualified for singing by castration, but could get no certain intelligence. I was told at Milan that it was at Venice; at Venice that it was at Bologna; but at Bologna the fact was denied, and I was referred to Florence; from Florence to Rome, and from Rome I was sent to Naples&nbsp;... it is said that there are shops in Naples with this inscription: 'QUI SI CASTRANO RAGAZZI' (\"Here boys are castrated\"); but I was utterly unable to see or hear of any such shops during my residence in that city.<ref>Scholes, P (ed): ''Dr Burney's Musical Tours in Europe'' (London, 1959), vol. 1, p. 247</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe training of the boys was rigorous. The regimen of one singing school in Rome (c. 1700) consisted of one hour of singing difficult and awkward pieces, one hour practising trills, one hour practising ornamented passaggi, one hour of singing exercises in their teacher's presence and in front of a mirror so as to avoid unnecessary movement of the body or facial grimaces, and one hour of literary study; all this, moreover, before lunch. After, half an hour would be devoted to musical theory, another to writing counterpoint, an hour copying down the same from dictation, and another hour of literary study. During the remainder of the day, the young castrati had to find time to practice their harpsichord playing, and to compose vocal music, either sacred or secular depending on their inclination.<ref>see Bontempi, G: ''Historia Musica'' (Perugia, 1695), p. 170</ref> This demanding schedule meant that, if sufficiently talented, they were able to make a debut in their mid-teens with a perfect technique and a voice of a flexibility and power no woman or ordinary male singer could match.\n[[File:Scalzi by Flipart.jpg|thumb|left|The castrato [[Carlo Scalzi]], by Joseph Flipart, c. 1737.]]\n\nIn the 1720s and 1730s, at the height of the craze for these voices, it has been estimated that upwards of 4,000 boys were castrated annually in the service of art.<ref>a claim first made in Pleasants, H., \"The Castrati\", ''Stereo Review'', July 1966, p. 38)</ref> Many came from poor homes and were castrated by their parents in the hope that their child might be successful and lift them from poverty (this was the case with [[Senesino]]). There are, though, records of some young boys asking to be operated on to preserve their voices (e.g. [[Caffarelli (castrato)|Caffarelli]], who was from a wealthy family: his grandmother gave him the income from two vineyards to pay for his studies<ref>Faustini-Fassini, E.: ''Gli astri maggiori del bel canto napoletano'' in ''Note d'archivio'' 15, (1938), p. 12</ref>). Caffarelli was also typical of many castrati in being famous for tantrums on and off-stage, and for amorous adventures with noble ladies.<ref>see Heriot, pp. 141\u201354</ref> Some, as described by Casanova, preferred gentlemen (noble or otherwise).<ref>Casanova, G. ''Memoirs'' (tr. A. Machen, with additional tr. by A. Symons (London, 1894) vol. 4c, ch. 10; available online at www.gutenberg.net</ref> Only a small percentage of boys castrated to preserve their voices had successful careers on the operatic stage; the better \"also-rans\" sang in cathedral or church choirs, but because of their marked appearance and the ban on their marrying, there was little room for them in society outside a musical context.<ref>for a general discussion of castrati in society, see Barbier, ch. 7</ref>\n\nThe castrati came in for a great amount of scurrilous and unkind abuse, and as their fame increased, so did the hatred of them. They were often castigated as malign creatures who lured men into homosexuality. There were homosexual castrati, as [[Casanova]]'s accounts of 18th-century [[Italy]] bear witness. He mentions meeting an abb\u00e9 whom he took for a girl in disguise, only later discovering that \"she\" was a famous castrato. In Rome in 1762 he attended a performance at which the [[prima donna]] was a castrato, \"the favourite [[wikt:pathic|pathic]]\" of [[Scipione Borghese|Cardinal Borghese]], who dined every evening with his protector. From his behaviour on stage \"it was obvious that he hoped to inspire the love of those who liked him as a man, and probably would not have done so as a woman\".<ref>Angus Heriot, ''The Castrati in Opera'', London, 1956; Ed Wayne Dynes, ''Encyclopedia of Homosexuality'', New York, 1990</ref>\n\n==Decline==\n[[File:Moreschi giovane.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alessandro Moreschi]], the last of the Sistine castrati]]\nBy the late 18th century, changes in operatic taste and social attitudes spelled the end for castrati. They lingered on past the end of the ''[[ancien r\u00e9gime]]'' (which their style of opera parallels), and two of their number, [[Gaspare Pacchierotti|Pacchierotti]] and [[Crescentini]], even entranced the iconoclastic Napoleon. The last great operatic castrato was [[Giovanni Velluti (castrato)|Giovanni Battista Velluti]] (1781\u20131861), who performed the last operatic castrato role ever written: Armando in ''[[Il crociato in Egitto]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] (Venice, 1824). Soon after this they were replaced definitively as the first men of the operatic stage by a new breed of heroic tenor, as first incarnated by the Frenchman [[Gilbert-Louis Duprez]], the earliest so-called \"king of the high Cs\". His successors have included such singers as [[Enrico Tamberlik]], [[Jean de Reszke]], [[Francesco Tamagno]], [[Enrico Caruso]], [[Giovanni Martinelli]], [[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Jussi Bj\u00f6rling]], [[Franco Corelli]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]], among others.{{Listen|filename=Alessandro_Moreschi.ogg|title=A castrato singing|description=[[Alessandro Moreschi]] performs part of Eugenio Terziani's ''Hostias et preces''}}\n\nAfter the unification of Italy in 1861, castration for musical purposes was officially made illegal (the new Italian state had adopted a French legal code which expressly forbade the practice). In 1878, [[Pope Leo XIII]] prohibited the hiring of new castrati by the church: only in the Sistine Chapel and in other papal basilicas in Rome did a few castrati linger. A group photo of the Sistine Choir taken in 1898 shows that by then only six remained (plus the ''Direttore Perpetuo'', the fine soprano castrato Domenico Mustaf\u00e0), and in 1902 a ruling was extracted from Pope Leo that no further castrati should be admitted. The official end to the castrati came on St. Cecilia's Day, 22 November 1903, when the new pope, Pius X, issued his ''motu proprio'', ''Tra le Sollecitudini'' ('Amongst the Cares'), which contained this instruction: \"Whenever&nbsp;... it is desirable to employ the high voices of sopranos and contraltos, these parts must be taken by boys, according to the most ancient usage of the Church.\"\n\nThe last Sistine castrato to survive was [[Alessandro Moreschi]], the only castrato to have made solo recordings. While an interesting historical record, these discs of his give us only a glimpse of the castrato voice \u2013 although he had been renowned as \"The Angel of Rome\" at the beginning of his career, some would say he was past his prime when the recordings were made in 1902 and 1904 and he never attempted to sing opera.<ref>Clapton, N.: Alessandro Moreschi and the World of the Castrato (London, 2008), pp. 197\u2013216</ref> The recording technology of the day was not of modern high quality. He retired officially in March 1913, and died in 1922.\n\nThe Catholic Church's involvement in the castrato phenomenon has long been controversial, and there have recently been calls for it to issue an official apology for its role.

The singer in question was a pupil of Moreschi's, Domenico Mancini, such a successful imitator of his teacher's voice that even [[Lorenzo Perosi]], Direttore Perpetuo of the Sistine Choir from 1898 to 1956 and a strenuous opponent of the practice of castrato singers, thought he was a castrato.

Basically, a male can retain his child voice if it never changes during puberty. The retained voice can be the [[treble voice]] shared by both sexes in childhood and is the same as boy soprano voice.

Ideally, key length would coincide with the lower-bound on an algorithm's security. Indeed, most [[symmetric-key algorithm]]s are designed to have security equal to their key length. However, after design, a new attack might be discovered. For instance, [[Triple DES]] was designed to have a 168 bit key, but an attack of complexity 2<sup>112</sup> is now known (i.e., Triple DES has 112 bits of security). Nevertheless, as long as the relation between key length and security is sufficient for a particular application, then it doesn't matter if key length and security coincide. This is important for [[asymmetric-key algorithm]]s, because no such algorithm is known to satisfy this property; [[elliptic curve cryptography]] comes the closest with an effective security of roughly half its key length.\n\n==Significance==\n[[Key (cryptography)|Keys]] are used to control the operation of a cipher so that only the correct key can convert encrypted text ([[ciphertext]]) to [[plaintext]]. Many ciphers are actually based on publicly known [[algorithm]]s or are [[open source]] and so it is only the difficulty of obtaining the key that determines security of the system, provided that there is no analytic attack (i.e., a 'structural weakness' in the algorithms or protocols used), and assuming that the key is not otherwise available (such as via theft, extortion, or compromise of computer systems). The widely accepted notion that the security of the system should depend on the key alone has been explicitly formulated by [[Auguste Kerckhoffs]] (in the 1880s) and [[Claude Shannon]] (in the 1940s); the statements are known as [[Kerckhoffs' principle]] and Shannon's Maxim respectively.\n\nA key should therefore be large enough that a brute force attack (possible against any encryption algorithm) is infeasible &ndash; i.e., would take too long to execute. [[Claude Shannon|Shannon's]] work on [[information theory]] showed that to achieve so called ''[[perfect secrecy]]'', the key length must be at least as large as the message and only used once (this algorithm is called the [[One-time pad]]). In light of this, and the practical difficulty of managing such long keys, modern cryptographic practice has discarded the notion of perfect secrecy as a requirement for encryption, and instead focuses on ''[[computational security]]'', under which the computational requirements of breaking an encrypted text must be infeasible for an attacker.\n\n==Key size and encryption system==\nEncryption systems are often grouped into families. Common families include symmetric systems (e.g. [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]) and asymmetric systems (e.g. [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]); they may alternatively be grouped according to the central [[algorithm]] used (e.g. [[elliptic curve cryptography]]).\n\nAs each of these is of a different level of cryptographic complexity, it is usual to have different key sizes for the same [[level of security]], depending upon the algorithm used. For example, the security available with a 1024-bit key using asymmetric [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]] is considered approximately equal in security to an 80-bit key in a symmetric algorithm.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paul Ducklin |url=https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2013/05/27/anatomy-of-a-change-google-announces-it-will-double-its-ssl-key-sizes/ |title=Anatomy of a change \u2013 Google announces it will double its SSL key sizes \u2013 Naked Security |website=Nakedsecurity.sophos.com |date=2013-05-27 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n\nThe actual degree of security achieved over time varies, as more computational power and more powerful mathematical analytic methods become available. For this reason cryptologists tend to look at indicators that an algorithm or key length shows signs of potential vulnerability, to move to longer key sizes or more difficult algorithms. For example, {{As of|2007|05|lc=on}}, a 1039 bit integer was factored with the [[special number field sieve]] using 400 computers over 11 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/132184/article.html |title=Researcher: RSA 1024-bit Encryption not Enough |publisher=PCWorld |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref> The factored number was of a special form; the special number field sieve cannot be used on RSA keys. The computation is roughly equivalent to breaking a 700 bit RSA key. However, this might be an advance warning that 1024 bit RSA used in secure online commerce should be [[deprecation|deprecated]], since they may become breakable in the near future. Cryptography professor [[Arjen Lenstra]] observed that \"Last time, it took nine years for us to generalize from a special to a nonspecial, hard-to-factor number\" and when asked whether 1024-bit RSA keys are dead, said: \"The answer to that question is an unqualified yes.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Jacqui Cheng |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070523-researchers-307-digit-key-crack-endangers-1024-bit-rsa.html |title=Researchers: 307-digit key crack endangers 1024-bit RSA |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2007-05-23 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n\nThe 2015 [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam attack]] revealed additional dangers in using Diffie-Helman key exchange when only one or a few common 1024-bit or smaller prime moduli are in use.

Since longer symmetric keys require exponentially more work to brute force search, a sufficiently long symmetric key makes this line of attack impractical.\n\nWith a key of length ''n'' bits, there are 2<sup>n</sup> possible keys. This number grows very rapidly as ''n'' increases. The large number of operations (2<sup>128</sup>) required to try all possible 128-bit keys is widely considered [[Large numbers#Computers and computational complexity|out of reach]] for conventional digital computing techniques for the foreseeable future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1279619 |title=How secure is AES against brute force attacks? |publisher=EE Times |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>  However, experts anticipate alternative computing technologies that may have processing power superior to current computer technology. If a suitably sized [[quantum computer]] capable of running [[Grover's algorithm]] reliably becomes available, it would reduce a 128-bit key down to 64-bit security, roughly a [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]] equivalent. This is one of the reasons why [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] supports a 256-bit key length.  See the discussion on the relationship between key lengths and quantum computing attacks at the bottom of this page for more information.\n\n==Symmetric algorithm key lengths==\nUS Government export policy has long [[Export of cryptography in the United States|restricted the 'strength' of cryptography]] that can be sent out of the country. For many years the limit was [[40-bit encryption|40 bits]]. Today, a key length of 40 bits offers little protection against even a casual attacker with a single PC, a predictable and inevitable consequence of governmental restrictions limiting key length. In response, by the year 2000, most of the major US restrictions on the use of strong encryption were relaxed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/16028/governments_relax_encryption_regulations.html |title=Governments Relax Encryption Regulations |first=Jack |last=McCarthy |date=April 3, 2000 |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410194831/http://www.pcworld.com/article/16028/governments_relax_encryption_regulations.html |archivedate=April 10, 2012 |df= }}</ref> However, not all regulations have been removed, and encryption registration with the [[U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security]] is still required to export \"mass market encryption commodities, software and components with encryption exceeding 64 bits\" ({{Federal Register|75|36494}}).\n\nIBM's [[Lucifer (cipher)|Lucifer cipher]] was selected in 1974 as the base for what would become the [[Data Encryption Standard]].  Lucifer's key length was reduced from 128 bits to [[56-bit encryption|56 bits]], which the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and NIST argued was sufficient.

Thus, asymmetric algorithm keys must be longer for equivalent resistance to attack than symmetric algorithm keys.

The work factor for breaking Diffie-Hellman is based on the [[discrete logarithm problem]], which is related to the integer factorization problem on which RSA's strength is based. Thus, a 3072-bit Diffie-Hellman key has about the same strength as a 3072-bit RSA key.\n\nOne of the asymmetric algorithm types, [[elliptic curve cryptography]], or ECC, appears to be secure with shorter keys than other asymmetric key algorithms require. [[NIST]] guidelines state that ECC keys should be twice the length of equivalent strength symmetric key algorithms. So, for example, a 224-bit ECC key would have roughly the same strength as a 112-bit symmetric key. These estimates assume no major breakthroughs in solving the underlying mathematical problems that ECC is based on. A message encrypted with an elliptic key algorithm using a 109-bit long key has been broken by brute force.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.certicom.com/news-releases/300-solution-required-team-of-mathematicians-2600-computers-and-17-months- |title=Certicom Announces Elliptic Curve Cryptography Challenge Winner |website=Certicom.com |date=2004-04-27 |accessdate=2016-09-24}}</ref>\n\nThe [[NSA]] previously specified that \"Elliptic Curve Public Key Cryptography using the 256-bit prime modulus elliptic curve as specified in FIPS-186-2 and SHA-256 are appropriate for protecting classified information up to the SECRET level.

Of the two, Shor's offers the greater risk to current security systems.\n\nDerivatives of Shor's algorithm are widely conjectured to be effective against all mainstream public-key algorithms including [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]], [[Diffie-Hellman]] and [[elliptic curve cryptography]]. According to Professor Gilles Brassard, an expert in quantum computing: \"The time needed to factor an RSA integer is the same order as the time needed to use that same integer as modulus for a single RSA encryption.   In other words, it takes no more time to break RSA on a quantum computer (up to a multiplicative constant) than to use it legitimately on a classical computer.\" The general consensus is that these public key algorithms are insecure at any key size if sufficiently large quantum computers capable of running Shor's algorithm become available. The implication of this attack is that all data encrypted using current standards based security systems such as the ubiquitous [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] used to protect e-commerce and Internet banking and [[Secure Shell|SSH]] used to protect access to sensitive computing systems is at risk. Encrypted data protected using public-key algorithms can be archived and may be broken at a later time.\n\nMainstream symmetric ciphers (such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] or [[Twofish]]) and collision resistant hash functions (such as [[Secure Hash Algorithm|SHA]]) are widely conjectured to offer greater security against known quantum computing attacks. They are widely thought most vulnerable to [[Grover's algorithm]]. Bennett, Bernstein, Brassard, and Vazirani proved in 1996 that a brute-force key search on a quantum computer cannot be faster than roughly 2<sup>''n''/2</sup> invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2<sup>''n''</sup> in the classical case.<ref name=bennett_1997>Bennett C.H., Bernstein E., Brassard G., Vazirani U., ''[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/pubs/bbbv.ps The strengths and weaknesses of quantum computation]''. [[SIAM Journal on Computing]] 26(5): 1510-1523 (1997).</ref> Thus in the presence of large quantum computers an ''n''-bit key can provide at least ''n''/2 bits of security. Quantum brute force is easily defeated by doubling the key length, which has little extra computational cost in ordinary use. This implies that at least a 256-bit symmetric key is required to achieve 128-bit security rating against a quantum computer. As mentioned above, the NSA announced in 2015 that it plans to transition to quantum-resistant algorithms.<ref name=NSASuiteBphaseout />\n\nAccording to NSA \"A sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely-deployed public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures. ... It is generally accepted that quantum computing techniques are much less effective against symmetric algorithms than against current widely used public key algorithms. While public key cryptography requires changes in the fundamental design to protect against a potential future quantum computer, symmetric key algorithms are believed to be secure provided a sufficiently large key size is used. ... In the longer term, NSA looks to [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] to identify a broadly accepted, standardized suite of commercial public key algorithms that are not vulnerable to quantum attacks.\n\n{{As of|2016}}, the NSA's Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite includes:<ref name=nsaQCfaq>[https://cryptome.org/2016/01/CNSA-Suite-and-Quantum-Computing-FAQ.pdf Commercial National Security Algorithm Suite and Quantum Computing FAQ] U.S. National Security Agency, January 2016</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

person as a whole and decide what can be altered. \n\n===Cognitive distortions===\nTherapists or computer-based programs use CBT techniques to help individuals challenge their patterns and beliefs and replace errors in thinking, known as [[cognitive distortions]], such as \"''overgeneralizing, magnifying negatives, minimizing positives and catastrophizing''\" with \"''more realistic and effective thoughts, thus decreasing emotional distress and self-defeating behavior''\".<ref name=\"HassettAL\" /> Cognitive distortions can be either a pseudo-discrimination belief or an over-generalization of

Studies have provided evidence that when examining animals and humans that [[glucocorticoids]] may possibly lead to a more successful extinction learning during exposure therapy. For instance, glucocorticoids can prevent aversive learning episodes from being retrieved and heighten reinforcement of memory traces creating a non-fearful reaction in feared situations.

Beck]]'s cognitive theory of depression. His theory states that depressed people think the way they do because their thinking is biased towards negative interpretations. According to this theory, depressed people acquire a negative [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] of the world in childhood and adolescence as an effect of stressful life events, and the negative schema is activated later in life when the person encounters similar situations.<ref name=\"Neale247\">{{Cite book|vauthors=Neale JM, Davison GC |title = Abnormal psychology|edition = 8th|publisher = John Wiley & Sons|location = New York|year = 2001|page = 247|isbn = 978-0-471-31811-8}}</ref>\n\nBeck also described a negative [[Beck's cognitive triad|cognitive triad]]. The cognitive triad is made up of the depressed individual's negative evaluations of themselves, the world, and the future. Beck suggested that these negative evaluations derive from the negative schemata and cognitive biases of the person. According to this theory, depressed people have views such as \"I never do a good job\", \"It is impossible to have a good day\", and \"things will never get better\". A negative schema helps give rise to the cognitive bias, and the cognitive bias helps fuel the negative schema. Beck further proposed that depressed people often have the following cognitive biases: [[arbitrary inference]], [[selective abstraction]], over-generalization, magnification, and [[Minimisation (psychology)|minimization]]. These cognitive biases are quick to make negative, generalized, and personal inferences of the self, thus fueling the negative schema.<ref name=\"Neale247\" />\n\nIn long-term [[Psychosis|psychoses]], CBT is used to complement medication and is adapted to meet individual needs.

Because smoking is often easily accessible, and quickly allows the user to feel good, it can take precedence over other coping strategies, and eventually work its way into everyday life during non-stressful events as well. CBT aims to target the function of the behavior, as it can vary between individuals, and works to inject other coping mechanisms in place of smoking.

Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing.</ref> During these sessions, Beck noticed that thoughts were not as unconscious as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] had previously theorized, and that certain types of thinking may be the culprits of emotional distress.<ref name=\"EABH\" /> It was from this hypothesis that Beck developed [[cognitive therapy]], and called these thoughts \"automatic thoughts\".<ref name=\"EABH\" />\n\nIt was these two therapies, rational emotive therapy and cognitive therapy, that started the \"second wave\" of CBT, which was the emphasis on cognitive factors.<ref name=\"Wilson\" />\n\n=== Behavior and cognitive therapies merge - 'third wave' CBT ===\nAlthough the early behavioral approaches were successful in many of the neurotic disorders, they had little success in treating [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].<ref name=\"Trull\" /><ref name=\"Rachman_1997\" /><ref>Thorpe, G.

The therapeutic approaches of [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and Aaron T.

During the 1980s and 1990s, cognitive and behavioral techniques were merged into cognitive behavioral therapy.

Like CBT, SCBT asserts that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions. SCBT also builds on core CBT philosophy by incorporating other well-known modalities in the fields of [[behavioral health]] and [[psychology]]: most notably, [[Albert Ellis]]'s [[rational emotive behavior therapy]]. SCBT differs from CBT in two distinct ways. First, SCBT is delivered in a highly regimented format. Second, SCBT is a predetermined and finite training process that becomes personalized by the input of the participant. SCBT is designed with the intention to bring a participant to a specific result in a specific period of time. SCBT has been used to challenge addictive behavior, particularly with substances such as tobacco, alcohol and food, and to manage [[diabetes]] and subdue stress and anxiety. SCBT has also been used in the field of [[criminal psychology]] in the effort to reduce recidivism.\n\n=== {{anchor|MRT}}Moral reconation therapy ===\nMoral reconation therapy, a type of CBT used to help felons overcome [[antisocial personality disorder]] (ASPD), slightly decreases the risk of further offending.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferguson|first1=LM|last2=Wormith|first2=JS|title=A meta-analysis of moral reconation therapy|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|date=September 2013|volume=57|issue=9|pages=1076\u2013106|pmid=22744908|doi=10.1177/0306624x12447771}}</ref> It is generally implemented in a group format because of the risk of offenders with ASPD being given one-on-one therapy reinforces narcissistic behavioral characteristics, and can be used in correctional or outpatient settings.

This usually is used to help clients better cope with their stress or anxiety after stressful events.<ref name=\"Meichenbaum 1996 4\u20137\">{{cite journal|last= Meichenbaum| first = D|title = Stress Inoculation Training for Coping with Stressors| journal = The Clinical Psychologist | year = 1996|volume = 69|pages = 4\u20137}}</ref> This is a three-phase process that trains the client to use skills that they already have to better adapt to their current stressors. The first phase is an interview phase that includes psychological testing, client self-monitoring, and a variety of reading materials. This allows the therapist to individually tailor the training process to the client.<ref name=\"Meichenbaum 1996 4\u20137\"/> Clients learn how to categorize problems into emotion-focused or problem-focused, so that they can better treat their negative situations. This phase ultimately prepares the client to eventually confront and reflect upon their current reactions to stressors, before looking at ways to change their reactions and emotions in relation to their stressors. The focus is conceptualization.<ref name=\"Meichenbaum 1996 4\u20137\"/>\n\nThe second phase emphasizes the aspect of skills acquisition and rehearsal that continues from the earlier phase of conceptualization. The client is taught skills that help them cope with their stressors. These skills are then practised in the space of therapy. These skills involve self-regulation, problem-solving, interpersonal communication skills, etc.<ref name=\"Meichenbaum 1996 4\u20137\"/>\n\nThe third and final phase is the application and following through of the skills learned in the training process. This gives the client opportunities to apply their learned skills to a wide range of stressors. Activities include role-playing, imagery, modeling, etc. In the end, the client will have been trained on a preventative basis to inoculate personal, chronic, and future stressors by breaking down their stressors into problems they will address in long-term, short-term, and intermediate coping goals.<ref name=\"Meichenbaum 1996 4\u20137\"/>\n\n=== Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy ===\nMindfulness-based cognitive behavioral hypnotherapy (MCBH) is a form of CBT focusing on awareness in reflective approach with addressing of subconscious tendencies.

''Cultures of healing: Correcting the image of American mental health care''. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref> have questioned the validity of such claims. For example, one study<ref name = Tolin/> determined CBT to be superior to other treatments in treating anxiety and depression. However, researchers<ref name = Baardseth/> responding directly to that study conducted a re-analysis and found no evidence of CBT being superior to other bona fide treatments, and conducted an analysis of thirteen other CBT clinical trials and determined that they failed to provide evidence of CBT superiority.\n\nA major criticism has been that clinical studies of CBT efficacy (or any psychotherapy) are not double-blind (i.e., either the subjects or the therapists in psychotherapy studies are not blind to the type of treatment). They may be single-blinded, i.e. the rater may not know the treatment the patient received, but neither the patients nor the therapists are blinded to the type of therapy given (two out of three of the persons involved in the trial, i.e., all of the persons involved in the treatment, are unblinded). The patient is an active participant in correcting negative distorted thoughts, thus quite aware of the treatment group they are in.<ref name=\"psychiatrictimes.com\" />\n\nThe importance of double-blinding was shown in a meta-analysis that examined the effectiveness of CBT when placebo control and blindedness were factored in.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Lynch D |author2=Laws KR |author3=McKenna PJ |year = 2010 |title= Cognitive behavioral therapy for major psychiatric disorder: does it really work?

This study concluded that CBT is no better than non-specific control interventions in the treatment of schizophrenia and does not reduce relapse rates; treatment effects are small in treatment studies of MDD, and it is not an effective treatment strategy for prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder. For MDD, the authors note that the pooled effect size was very low. Nevertheless, the methodological processes used to select the studies in the previously mentioned meta-analysis and the worth of its findings have been called into question.<ref>{{Cite journal|pmid = 19917145|year = 2010|last1 = Lincoln|first1 = TM|title = Letter to the editor: A comment on Lynch et al.

Additional sub-analysis revealed that CBT studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to adhere to the Beck CBT manual had a steeper decline in effect sizes since 1977 than studies where therapists in the test group were instructed to use CBT without a manual. The authors reported that they were unsure why the effects were declining but did list inadequate therapist training, failure to adhere to a manual, lack of therapist experience, and patients' hope and faith in its efficacy waning as potential reasons.<!-- <ref name = Johnsen2015/> --> The authors did mention that the current study was limited to depressive disorders only.<ref name = Johnsen2015>{{cite journal|last1=Johnsen|first1=TJ|last2=Friborg|first2=O|title=The effects of cognitive behavioral therapy as an anti-depressive treatment is falling: A meta-analysis.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=July 2015|volume=141|issue=4|pages=747\u201368|pmid=25961373|doi=10.1037/bul0000015}}</ref>\n\n===High drop-out rates===\nFurthermore, other researchers<ref name = Cuijpers/> write that CBT studies have high drop-out rates compared to other treatments. At times, the CBT drop-out rates can be more than five times higher than other treatments groups. For example, the researchers provided statistics of 28 participants in a group receiving CBT therapy dropping out, compared to 5 participants in a group receiving problem-solving therapy dropping out, or 11 participants in a group receiving [[Psychodynamics|psychodynamic]] therapy dropping out.<ref name = Cuijpers/> This high drop-out rate is also evident in the treatment of several disorders, particularly the [[eating disorder]] [[anorexia nervosa]], which is commonly treated with CBT. Those treated with CBT have a high chance of dropping out of therapy before completion and reverting to their anorexia behaviors.<ref>Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan (2014). Abnormal Psychology (6 ed.). McGraw-Hill Education. p. 357. {{ISBN|9781259060724}}.</ref>\n\nOther researchers<ref name = Glenn/> conducting an analysis of treatments for youths who self-injure found similar drop-out rates in CBT and [[Dialectical behavioral therapy|DBT]] groups. In this study, the researchers analyzed several clinical trials that measured the efficacy of CBT administered to youths who self-injure. The researchers concluded that none of them were found to be efficacious. These conclusions<ref name = Glenn/> were made using the [[American Psychological Association|APA]] Division 12 Task Force on the Promotion and Dissemination of Psychological Procedures to determine intervention potency.<ref name = Chambless>Chambless, D. L., Babich, K., Crits-Christoph, P., Frank, E., Gilson, M., & Montgomery, R. (1993). ''Task force on the promotion and dissemination of psychological procedures: A reported adopted by the Division 12 Board''. Unpublished report.</ref>\n\n===Philosophical concerns with CBT methods===\nThe methods employed in CBT research have not been the only criticisms; some individuals have called its theory and therapy into question. For example, Fancher<ref name = Fancher/> argues that CBT has failed to provide a framework for clear and correct thinking. He states that it is strange for CBT theorists to develop a framework for determining [[Cognitive distortion|distorted thinking]] without ever developing a framework for \"cognitive clarity\" or what would count as \"healthy, normal thinking.\" Additionally, he writes that irrational thinking cannot be a source of mental and emotional distress when there is no evidence of rational thinking causing psychological well-being. Or, that social psychology has proven the normal cognitive processes of the average person to be irrational, even those who are psychologically well. Fancher also says that the theory of CBT is inconsistent with basic principles and research of rationality, and even ignores many rules of logic. He argues that CBT makes something of thinking that is far less exciting and true than thinking probably is. Among his other arguments are the maintaining of the status quo promoted in CBT, the self-deception encouraged within clients and patients engaged in CBT, how poorly the research is conducted, and some of its basic tenets and norms: \"The basic norm of cognitive therapy is this: except for how the patient thinks, everything is ok\".<ref>Fancher, R. T. (1995). ''Cultures of healing: Correcting the image of American mental health care (p. 231)''. New York: W. H. Freeman and Company.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Slife and Williams<ref name = Slife/> write that one of the hidden assumptions in CBT is that of [[determinism]], or the absence of [[free will]]. They argue that CBT invokes a type of cause-and-effect relationship with cognition. They state that CBT holds that external stimuli from the environment enter the mind, causing different thoughts that cause emotional states. Nowhere in CBT theory is agency, or free will, accounted for. At its most basic foundational assumptions, CBT holds that human beings have no free will and are just determined by the cognitive processes invoked by external stimuli.\n\nAnother criticism of CBT theory, especially as applied to major depressive disorder (MDD), is that it confounds the symptoms of the disorder with its causes.<ref name=\"psychiatrictimes.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/cognitive-behavioral-therapy-escape-binds-tight-methodology/page/0/1?cid=fb#sthash.ti9rtA48.dpuf|title=Cognitive Behavioral Therapy: Escape From the Binds of Tight Methodology - Psychiatric Times|date=30 July 2013|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Side effects===\nCBT is generally seen as having very low if any side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/details/risks/cmc-20186935|title=Risks - Mayo Clinic|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/0/23590545|title=Can cognitive behavioural therapy really change our brains?|date=6 August 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://whatyoushouldknow.depression-alliance.co.uk/non-drug-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302043906/http://whatyoushouldknow.depression-alliance.co.uk/non-drug-treatments/cognitive-behavioural-therapy |archive-date=2015-03-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> Calls have been made for more appraisal of CBT side effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalelfservice.net/treatment/psychotherapy/psychotherapy-trials-should-report-the-side-effects-of-treatment/|title=Psychotherapy trials should report on the side effects of treatment|date=30 April 2014|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0072481/|title=Cognitive behavioral therapy|first=|last=pmhdev|date=8 September 2016|publisher=|via=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref>\n\n== Society and culture ==\nThe UK's [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] announced in 2008 that more therapists would be trained to provide CBT at government expense<ref name=\"Laurence\" /> as part of an initiative called [[Improving Access to Psychological Therapies]] (IAPT).<ref name=\"Leader\">{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/sep/09/psychology.humanbehaviour|author = Leader D|title = A quick fix for the soul|date = September 8, 2008|work = The Guardian|accessdate = April 22, 2012}}</ref> the [[National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence|NICE]] said that CBT would become the mainstay of treatment for non-severe depression, with medication used only in cases where CBT had failed.<ref name=\"Laurence\" /> Therapists complained that the data does not fully support the attention and funding CBT receives.

Chinese is spoken by the [[Han Chinese|Han]] majority and many minority ethnic groups in [[China]]. About 1.2 billion people (around 16% of the world's population) speak some form of Chinese as their [[first language]].\n\nThe [[varieties of Chinese]] are usually described by native speakers as dialects of a single Chinese language, but linguists note that they are as diverse as a [[language family]].{{efn|Various examples include:\n* David Crystal, ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), p. 312. \"The mutual unintelligibility of the varieties is the main ground for referring to them as separate languages.\"\n* Charles N. Li, Sandra A. Thompson. ''Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar'' (1989), p. 2. \"The Chinese language family is genetically classified as an independent branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family.\"\n* {{harvtxt|Norman|1988}}, p. 1. \"[...] the modern Chinese dialects are really more like a family of languages [...]\"\n* {{harvtxt|DeFrancis|1984}}, p. 56. \"To call Chinese a single language composed of dialects with varying degrees of difference is to mislead by minimizing disparities that according to Chao are as great as those between English and Dutch. To call Chinese a family of languages is to suggest extralinguistic differences that in fact do not exist and to overlook the unique linguistic situation that exists in China.\"\nLinguists in China often use a formulation introduced by [[Fu Maoji]] in the ''[[Encyclopedia of China]]'': \u201c\u6c49\u8bed\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u7cfb\u5c5e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bed\u65cf\u7684\u5730\u4f4d\u3002\u201d (\"In language classification, Chinese has a status equivalent to a language family.\"){{sfnp|Mair|1991|pp=10, 21}}\n}}\nThe internal diversity of Chinese has been likened to that of the [[Romance languages]], but may be even more varied. There are between 7 and 13 main regional groups of Chinese (depending on classification scheme), of which the most spoken by far is [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (about 960 million, e.g. [[Southwestern Mandarin]]), followed by [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (80 million, e.g. [[Shanghainese]]), [[Min Chinese|Min]] (70 million, e.g. [[Southern Min]]), [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (60 million, e.g. [[Cantonese]]), etc. Most of these groups are mutually unintelligible, and even dialect groups within Min Chinese may not be mutually intelligible. Some, however, like [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] and certain [[Southwest Mandarin]] dialects, may share common terms and a certain degree of intelligibility. All varieties of Chinese are [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and [[Analytic language|analytic]].\n\n[[Standard Chinese]] ''(P\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0/Gu\u00f3y\u01d4/Hu\u00e1y\u01d4)'' is a standardized form of spoken Chinese based on the [[Beijing dialect]] of Mandarin. It is the official language of [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], as well as one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]]. It is one of the [[Official languages of the United Nations|six official languages]] of the [[United Nations]]. The [[written Chinese|written form]] of the standard language ({{lang|zh|\u4e2d\u6587}}; ''Zh\u014dngw\u00e9n''), based on the [[logograms]] known as [[Chinese characters]] ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u6c49\u5b57}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u6f22\u5b57}}; ''H\u00e0nz\u00ec''), is shared by literate speakers of otherwise unintelligible dialects.\n\nThe earliest Chinese written records are [[Shang dynasty]]-era oracle inscriptions, which can be traced back to 1250 BCE. The phonetic categories of [[Archaic Chinese]] can be reconstructed from the rhymes of ancient poetry. During the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period, [[Middle Chinese]] went through several [[sound changes]] and split into several varieties following prolonged geographic and political separation. ''[[Qieyun]]'', a [[rime dictionary]], recorded a compromise between the pronunciations of different regions. The royal courts of the Ming and early Qing dynasties operated using a [[koin\u00e9 language]] ([[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|Guanhua]]) based on [[Nanjing dialect]] of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]]. [[Standard Chinese]] was adopted in the 1930s, and is now the official language of both the People's Republic of China and Taiwan.\n\n== Classification ==\nMost linguists classify all varieties of Chinese as part of the [[Sino-Tibetan language family]], together with [[Burmese language|Burmese]], [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]] and many other languages spoken in the [[Himalayas]] and the [[Southeast Asian Massif]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=12\u201313}}\nAlthough the relationship was first proposed in the early 19th century and is now broadly accepted, reconstruction of Sino-Tibetan is much less developed than that of families such as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] or [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]].\nDifficulties have included the great diversity of the languages, the lack of inflection in many of them, and the effects of language contact.\nIn addition, many of the smaller languages are spoken in mountainous areas that are difficult to reach, and are often also sensitive border zones.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|pp=422, 434\u2013436}}\nWithout a secure reconstruction of proto-Sino-Tibetan, the higher-level structure of the family remains unclear.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=426}}\nA top-level branching into Chinese and [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] is often assumed, but has not been convincingly demonstrated.{{sfnp|Handel|2008|p=431}}\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of the Chinese language}}\n\nThe first written records appeared over 3,000 years ago during the [[Shang dynasty]]. As the language evolved over this period, the various local varieties became mutually unintelligible.  In reaction, central governments have repeatedly sought to promulgate a unified standard.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=183\u2013185}}\n\n=== Old and Middle Chinese ===\nThe earliest examples of Chinese are divinatory inscriptions on [[oracle bone]]s from around 1250 BCE in the late [[Shang dynasty]].{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=1}}\n[[Old Chinese]] was the language of the [[Western Zhou]] period (1046\u2013771 BCE), recorded in [[Chinese bronze inscriptions|inscriptions on bronze artifacts]], the ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' and portions of the ''[[Book of Documents]]'' and ''[[I Ching]]''.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=2\u20133}}\nScholars have attempted to reconstruct the [[phonology of Old Chinese]] by comparing later varieties of Chinese with the rhyming practice of the ''Classic of Poetry'' and the phonetic elements found in the majority of Chinese characters.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=42\u201345}}\nAlthough many of the finer details remain unclear, most scholars agree that Old Chinese differs from Middle Chinese in lacking retroflex and palatal obstruents but having initial consonant clusters of some sort, and in having voiceless nasals and liquids.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=177}}\nMost recent reconstructions also describe an atonal language with consonant clusters at the end of the syllable, developing into [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] distinctions in Middle Chinese.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=181\u2013183}}\nSeveral [[derivational affix]]es have also been identified, but the language lacks [[inflection]], and indicated grammatical relationships using word order and [[grammatical particle]]s.{{sfnp|Schuessler|2007|p=12}}\n\n[[Middle Chinese]] was the language used during [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] and the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties (6th through 10th centuries CE).\nIt can be divided into an early period, reflected by the ''[[Qieyun]]'' [[rime book]] (601 CE), and a late period in the 10th century, reflected by [[rhyme table]]s such as the ''[[Yunjing]]'' constructed by ancient Chinese philologists as a guide to the ''Qieyun'' system.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|pp=14\u201315}}\nThese works define phonological categories, but with little hint of what sounds they represent.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=125}}\nLinguists have identified these sounds by comparing the categories with pronunciations in modern [[varieties of Chinese]], [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowed Chinese words]] in Japanese, Vietnamese, and Korean, and transcription evidence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=34\u201342}}\nThe resulting system is very complex, with a large number of consonants and vowels, but they are probably not all distinguished in any single dialect.  Most linguists now believe it represents a [[diasystem]] encompassing 6th-century northern and southern standards for reading the classics.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=24}}\n\n=== Classical and literary forms ===\n{{main|Classical Chinese}}\n\nThe relationship between spoken and written Chinese is rather complex. Its spoken varieties have evolved at different rates, while written Chinese itself has changed much less. [[Classical Chinese]] [[literature]] began in the [[Spring and Autumn period]].\n\n=== Rise of northern dialects ===\nAfter the fall of the [[Northern Song]] dynasty, and during the reign of the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] (Jurchen) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (Mongol) dynasties in northern China, a common speech (now called [[Old Mandarin]]) developed based on the dialects of the [[North China Plain]] around the capital.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=48}}\nThe ''[[Zhongyuan Yinyun]]'' (1324) was a dictionary that codified the rhyming conventions of new ''[[sanqu]]'' verse form in this language.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=48\u201349}}\nTogether with the slightly later ''[[Menggu Ziyun]]'', this dictionary describes a language with many of the features characteristic of modern [[Mandarin dialects]].{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=49\u201351}}\n\nUp to the early 20th century, most of the people in China spoke only their local variety.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=133, 247}}\nAs a practical measure, officials of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties carried out the administration of the empire using a [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|common language based on Mandarin varieties]], known as ''Gu\u0101nhu\u00e0'' (\u5b98\u8bdd/\u5b98\u8a71, literally \"language of officials\").{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=136}}\nFor most of this period, this language was a [[Koin\u00e9 language|koin\u00e9]] based on dialects spoken in the [[Nanjing]] area, though not identical to any single dialect.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=549\u2013550}}\nBy the middle of the 19th century, the Beijing dialect had become dominant and was essential for any business with the imperial court.{{sfnp|Coblin|2000|pp=540\u2013541}}\n\nIn the 1930s a [[Standard Chinese|standard national language]] ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u56fd\u8bed}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|\u570b\u8a9e}} \"national language\") was adopted.\nAfter much dispute between proponents of northern and southern dialects and an abortive attempt at an artificial pronunciation, the [[National Languages Committee|National Language Unification Commission]] finally settled on the Beijing dialect in 1932.\nThe People's Republic founded in 1949 retained this standard, calling it ''p\u01d4t\u014dnghu\u00e0'' ({{lang|zh-Hans|\u666e\u901a\u8bdd}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u666e\u901a\u8a71}} \"common speech\").{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|pp=3\u201315}}\nThe national language is now used in education, the media, and formal situations in both Mainland China and Taiwan.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=133}}\nIn [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], because of their colonial and linguistic history, the language used in education, the media, formal speech, and everyday life remains the local [[Cantonese]], although the standard language has become very influential and is being taught in schools.{{sfnp|Zhang|Yang|2004}}\n\n=== Influence ===\n{{see also|Adoption of Chinese literary culture|Sino-Xenic vocabularies}}\n\n[[File:Tripitaka Koreana.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Tripitaka Koreana]]'', a Korean collection of the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]]]]\n\nThe Chinese language has spread to neighbouring countries through a variety of means.\nNorthern Vietnam was incorporated into the [[Han empire]] in 111 BCE, marking the beginning of a [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|period of Chinese control]] that ran almost continuously for a millennium.\nThe [[Four Commanderies of Han|Four Commanderies]] were established in northern Korea in the first century BCE, but disintegrated in the following centuries.{{sfnp|Sohn|Lee|2003|p=23}}\n[[Chinese Buddhism]] spread over East Asia between the 2nd and 5th centuries CE, and with it the study of scriptures and literature in [[Literary Chinese]].{{sfnp|Miller|1967|pp=29\u201330}}\nLater Korea, Japan, and Vietnam developed strong central governments modeled on Chinese institutions, with Literary Chinese as the language of administration and scholarship, a position it would retain until the late 19th century in Korea and (to a lesser extent) Japan, and the early 20th century in Vietnam.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=75\u201377}}\nScholars from different lands could communicate, albeit only in writing, using Literary Chinese.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=67}}\n\nAlthough they used Chinese solely for written communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]].\nChinese words with these pronunciations were also extensively imported into the [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] languages, and today comprise over half of their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98\u201399}}\nThis massive influx led to changes in the phonological structure of the languages, contributing to the development of [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]ic structure in Japanese{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|pp=120\u2013121}} and the disruption of vowel harmony in Korean.{{sfnp|Sohn|2001|p=89}}\n\nBorrowed Chinese morphemes have been used extensively in all these languages to coin compound words for new concepts, in a similar way to the use of [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] roots in European languages.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=146}}\nMany new compounds, or new meanings for old phrases, were created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to name Western concepts and artifacts.\nThese coinages, written in shared Chinese characters, have then been borrowed freely between languages.\nThey have even been accepted into Chinese, a language usually resistant to loanwords, because their foreign origin was hidden by their written form.\nOften different compounds for the same concept were in circulation for some time before a winner emerged, and sometimes the final choice differed between countries.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2000|p=43}}\nThe proportion of vocabulary of Chinese origin thus tends to be greater in technical, abstract, or formal language.\nFor example, in Japan, [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Sino-Japanese words]] account for about 35% of the words in entertainment magazines, over half the words in newspapers, and 60% of the words in science magazines.{{sfnp|Shibatani|1990|p=143}}\n\nVietnam, Korea, and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, initially based on [[Chinese characters]], but later replaced with the ''[[Hangul]]'' alphabet for Korean and supplemented with ''[[kana]]'' syllabaries for Japanese, while Vietnamese continued to be written with the complex ''[[Ch\u1eef n\u00f4m]]'' script.\nHowever, these were limited to popular literature until the late 19th century.\nToday Japanese is written with a composite script using both Chinese characters (''[[Kanji]]'') and kana. Korean is written exclusively with Hangul in North Korea, and supplementary Chinese characters (''[[Hanja]]'') are increasingly rarely used in South Korea.\nVietnamese is written with [[Vietnamese alphabet|a Latin-based alphabet]].\n\nExamples of [[List of English words of Chinese origin|loan words in English]] include \"[[tea]]\", from [[Hokkien]] (Min Nan) ''{{Linktext|t\u00ea}}'' ({{Linktext|\u8336|lang=zh}}), \"[[dim sum]]\", from Cantonese ''dim<sup>2</sup> sam<sup>1</sup>''  and \"[[kumquat]]\", from Cantonese ''gam<sup>1</sup>gwat<sup>1</sup>'' ({{Linktext|\u91d1\u6a58|;ang=zh}}).\n\n== Varieties ==\n{{Main|Varieties of Chinese}}\n[[File:Map of sinitic languages full-en.svg|upright=2|thumb|right|Range of Chinese dialect groups according to the ''Language Atlas of China''{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}]]\n<!--This is a summary. Please add new information to [[Varieties of Chinese]].-->\n[[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] estimated that there are hundreds of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}} These varieties form a [[dialect continuum]], in which differences in speech generally become more pronounced as distances increase, though the rate of change varies immensely.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|pp=189\u2013190}} Generally, mountainous South China exhibits more linguistic diversity than the [[North China Plain]]. In parts of South China, a major city's dialect may only be marginally intelligible to close neighbors. For instance, [[Wuzhou]] is about {{convert|120|mi|km}} upstream from [[Guangzhou]], but the [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] variety spoken there is more like that of Guangzhou than is that of [[Taishan, Guangdong|Taishan]], {{convert|60|mi|km|round=5}} southwest of Guangzhou and separated from it by several rivers.{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=23}} In parts of [[Fujian]] the speech of neighboring counties or even villages may be mutually unintelligible.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=188}}\n\nUntil the late 20th century, Chinese emigrants to Southeast Asia and North America came from southeast coastal areas, where Min, Hakka, and Yue dialects are spoken.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=191}}\nThe vast majority of Chinese immigrants to North America spoke the [[Taishan dialect]], from a small coastal area southwest of [[Guangzhou]].{{sfnp|Ramsey|1987|p=98}}\n\n=== Grouping ===\n{{pie chart\n| caption = Proportions of first-language speakers{{sfnp|Chinese Academy of Social Sciences|2012|p=3}}\n| label1 = [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] | value1 = 66.2 | color1 = #ac8761\n| label2 = [[Min Chinese|Min]] | value2 = 6.2 | color2 = #b1bab6\n| label3 = [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] | value3 = 6.1 | color3 = #c8c8a8\n| label4 = [[Jin Chinese|Jin]] | value4 = 5.2 | color4 = #96642c\n| label5 = [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] | value5 = 4.9 | color5 = #bf6e7b\n| label6 = [[Gan Chinese|Gan]] | value6 = 4.0 | color6 = #fbd98d\n| label7 = [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] | value7 = 3.5 | color7 = #eeb36a\n| label8 = [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]] | value8 = 3.0 | color8 = #a5ae87\n| label9 = [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]] | value9 = 0.3 | color9 = #9b987f\n| label10 = [[Pinghua]], others | value10 = 0.6 | color10 = #946565\n| others = yes\n}}\nLocal varieties of Chinese are conventionally classified into seven dialect groups, largely on the basis of the different evolution of [[Middle Chinese]] voiced initials:{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=181}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=53\u201355}}\n* [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], including [[Standard Chinese]], [[Beijing dialect|Pekinese]], [[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]], and also the [[Dungan language]] spoken in [[Central Asia]]\n* [[Wu Chinese|Wu]], including [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]], [[Suzhou dialect|Suzhounese]], and [[Wenzhounese]]\n* [[Gan Chinese|Gan]]\n* [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]]\n* [[Min Chinese|Min]], including [[Fuzhou dialect|Fuzhounese]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hokkien]], [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]\n* [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]]\n* [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], including [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]]\n\nThe classification of [[Li Rong (linguist)|Li Rong]], which is used in the ''[[Language Atlas of China]]'' (1987), distinguishes three further groups:{{sfnp|Wurm|Li|Baumann|Lee|1987}}{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=55\u201356}}\n* [[Jin Chinese|Jin]], previously included in Mandarin.\n* [[Huizhou Chinese|Huizhou]], previously included in Wu.\n* [[Pinghua Chinese|Pinghua]], previously included in Yue.\n\nSome varieties remain unclassified, including [[Danzhou dialect]] (spoken in [[Danzhou]], on [[Hainan]] Island), [[Waxianghua]] (spoken in western [[Hunan]]) and [[Shaozhou Tuhua]] (spoken in northern [[Guangdong]]).{{sfnp|Kurpaska|2010|pp=72\u201373}}\n\n=== Standard Chinese ===\n{{Main|Standard Chinese|List of countries where Chinese is an official language}}\n<!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Standard Chinese]].-->\n[[Standard Chinese]], often called Mandarin, is the official [[standard language]] of [[China]] and [[Taiwan]], and one of the four official languages of [[Singapore]] (where it is called \"''Huayu''\" {{lang|zh-Hans|\u534e\u8bed}} or simply Chinese). Standard Chinese is based on the [[Beijing dialect]], the dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] as spoken in [[Beijing]]. The governments of both China and Taiwan intend for speakers of all Chinese speech varieties to use it as a common language of communication. Therefore, it is used in government agencies, in the media, and as a language of instruction in schools.\n\nIn [[mainland China]] and Taiwan, [[diglossia]] has been a common feature. For example, in addition to Standard Chinese, a resident of [[Shanghai]] might speak [[Shanghainese]]; and, if he or she grew up elsewhere, then he or she is also likely to be fluent in the particular dialect of that local area. A native of [[Guangzhou]] may speak both Cantonese and Standard Chinese. In addition to Mandarin, most [[Taiwanese people|Taiwanese]] also speak [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Minnan]], [[Hakka language|Hakka]], or an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kl\u00f6ter |first=Henning |date=2004 |journal=China Perspectives |volume=56 |issn=1996-4617 |url=http://chinaperspectives.revues.org/442 |title=Language Policy in the KMT and DPP eras |accessdate=30 May 2015}}</ref> A Taiwanese may commonly mix pronunciations, phrases, and words from Mandarin and other [[Languages of Taiwan|Taiwanese languages]], and this mixture is considered normal in daily or informal speech.<ref>{{cite thesis |last=Kuo |first=Yun-Hsuan |date=2005 |title=New dialect formation : the case of Taiwanese Mandarin |type=PhD |trans-title= |chapter= |publisher=University of Essex |docket= |oclc= |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/YUN-HSUAN_KUO |access-date=26 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Nomenclature ===\nThe official Chinese designation for the major branches of Chinese is ''f\u0101ngy\u00e1n'' ({{lang|zh|\u65b9\u8a00}}, literally \"regional speech\"), whereas the more closely related varieties within these are called ''d\u00ecdi\u01cen f\u0101ngy\u00e1n'' ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5730\u70b9\u65b9\u8a00}}/{{lang|zh-hant|\u5730\u9ede\u65b9\u8a00}} \"local speech\").{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}}  Conventional English-language usage in Chinese linguistics is to use ''dialect'' for the speech of a particular place (regardless of status) and ''dialect group'' for a regional grouping such as Mandarin or Wu.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}}  Because varieties from different groups are not [[mutually intelligible]], some scholars prefer to describe Wu and others as separate languages.{{sfnp|Thomason|1988|pp=27\u201328}}{{better source|reason=This claim needs a source specifically saying that scholars do this and for this reason|date=June 2015}} [[Jerry Norman (sinologist)|Jerry Norman]] called this practice misleading, pointing out that Wu, which itself contains many mutually unintelligible varieties, could not be properly called a single language under the same criterion, and that the same is true for each of the other groups.{{sfnp|Norman|2003|p=72}}\n\nMutual intelligibility is considered by some linguists to be the main criterion for determining whether varieties are separate languages or dialects of a single language,{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=17}} although others do not regard it as decisive,{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=54}}{{sfnp|Romaine|2000|pp=13, 23}}{{sfnp|Wardaugh|Fuller|2014|pp=28\u201332}}{{sfnp|Liang|2014|pp=11\u201314}}{{sfnp|Hymes|1971|p=64}} particularly when cultural factors interfere as they do with Chinese.{{sfnp|Thomason|1988|p=27}} As {{Harvcoltxt|Campbell|2008}} explains, linguists often ignore mutual intelligibility when varieties share intelligibility with a central variety (i.e. [[prestige variety]], such as [[Standard Mandarin]]), as the issue requires some careful handling when mutual intelligibility is inconsistent with language identity.{{sfnp|Campbell|2008|p=637}} [[John DeFrancis]] argues that it is inappropriate to refer to Mandarin, Wu and so on as \"dialects\" because the mutual unintelligibility between them is too great. On the other hand, he also objects to considering them as separate languages, as it incorrectly implies a set of disruptive \"religious, economic, political, and other differences\" between speakers that exist, for example, between [[French language in Canada|French Catholics]] and English Protestants in Canada, but not between speakers of Cantonese and Mandarin in China, owing to China's near-uninterrupted history of centralized government.{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|pp=55\u201357}}\n\nBecause of the difficulties involved in determining the difference between language and dialect, other terms have been proposed: [[ISO 639-3]] follows ''[[Ethnologue]]'' in assigning individual language codes to the 13 main subdivisions, while Chinese as a whole is classified as a '[[macrolanguage]]'.{{sfnp|Lewis|Simons|Fennig|2015}} Other options include ''vernacular'',{{sfnp|Haugen|1966|p=927}} ''lect'' <ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Bailey|1973|p=11}}, cited in {{Harvcoltxt|Groves|2008|p=1}}</ref> ''regionalect'',{{sfnp|DeFrancis|1984|p=57}} ''topolect'',{{sfnp|Mair|1991|p=7}} and ''variety''.{{sfnp|Hudson|1996|p=22}}\n\nMost Chinese people consider the spoken varieties as one single language because speakers share a common culture and history, as well as a shared national identity and a common written form.{{sfnp|Baxter|1992|p=7\u20138}} To Chinese nationalists, the idea of Chinese as a language family may suggest that the Chinese identity is much more fragmented and disunified than it actually is and as such is often looked upon as culturally and politically provocative. Additionally, {{citation needed span|in [[Taiwan]] it is closely associated with [[Taiwanese independence]],|date=June 2015}} some of whose supporters promote the local [[Taiwanese Hokkien]] variety.\n\n== Phonology ==\n{{see also|Standard Chinese phonology|Historical Chinese phonology|Varieties of Chinese#Phonology}}\n\n[[File:Edmund_Yeo_-_voice_-_ch_150127_1828.wav|thumb|Spoken [[Mandarin Chinese]]]]\n\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] structure of each syllable consists of a [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] that has a [[vowel]] (which can be a [[monophthong]], [[diphthong]], or even a [[triphthong]] in certain varieties), preceded by an [[syllable onset|onset]] (a single [[consonant]], or consonant+[[semivowel|glide]]; zero onset is also possible), and followed (optionally) by a [[syllable coda|coda]] consonant; a syllable also carries a [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. There are some instances where a vowel is not used as a nucleus. An example of this is in [[Cantonese]], where the [[nasal stop|nasal]] [[sonorant]] consonants {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} can stand alone as their own syllable.\n\nIn Mandarin much more than in other spoken varieties, most syllables tend to be open syllables, meaning they have no coda (assuming that a final [[semivowel|glide]] is not analyzed as a coda), but syllables that do have codas are restricted to nasals {{IPA|/m/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}}, the retroflex approximant {{IPA|/\u027b\u2009/}}, and voiceless stops {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}}, or {{IPA|/\u0294/}}. Some varieties allow most of these codas, whereas others, such as [[Standard Chinese]], are limited to only {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/\u014b/}} and {{IPA|/\u027b\u2009/}}.\n\nThe number of sounds in the different spoken dialects varies, but in general there has been a tendency to a reduction in sounds from [[Middle Chinese]]. The Mandarin dialects in particular have experienced a dramatic decrease in sounds and so have far more multisyllabic words than most other spoken varieties. The total number of syllables in some varieties is therefore only about a thousand, including tonal variation, which is only about an eighth as many as English.{{efn|name=DeFrancis p42|{{harvtxt|DeFrancis|1984}} p.42 counts Chinese as having 1,277 tonal syllables, and about 398 to 418 if tones are disregarded; he cites Jespersen, Otto (1928) ''Monosyllabism in English''; London, p.15 for a count of over 8000 syllables for English.}}\n\n=== Tones ===\nAll varieties of spoken Chinese use [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] to distinguish words.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=52}} A few dialects of north China may have as few as three tones, while some dialects in south China have up to 6 or 12 tones, depending on how one counts. One exception from this is [[Shanghainese dialect|Shanghainese]] which has reduced the set of tones to a two-toned [[pitch accent]] system much like modern Japanese.\n\nA very common example used to illustrate the use of tones in Chinese is the application of the four tones of [[Standard Chinese]] (along with the neutral tone) to the syllable ''ma''. The tones are exemplified by the following five Chinese words:\n{{Chinese tones}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Example of Standard Mandarin tones\n!Characters\n!Pinyin\n!Pitch contour\n!Meaning\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:\u5988|\u5988]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u5abd|\u5abd]]}}\n| ''m\u0101''\n| high level\n| \"mother\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u9ebb|\u9ebb]]}}\n| ''m\u00e1''\n| high rising\n| \"hemp\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:\u9a6c|\u9a6c]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u99ac|\u99ac]]}}\n| ''m\u01ce''\n| low falling-rising\n| \"horse\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:\u9a82|\u9a82]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u7f75|\u7f75]]}}\n| ''m\u00e0''\n| high falling\n| \"scold\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:\u5417|\u5417]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u55ce|\u55ce]]}}\n| ''ma''\n| neutral\n| question particle\n|}\n\nStandard [[Cantonese]], in contrast, has six tones in open syllables and three tones in syllables ending with stops:{{sfnp|Matthews|Yip|1994|pp=20\u201322}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Example of Standard Cantonese tones\n!Characters\n![[Jyutping]]\n!Pitch contour\n!Meaning\n|-\n|{{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:\u8bd7|\u8bd7]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u8a69|\u8a69]]}}\n| ''si1''\n| high level, high falling\n| \"poem\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u53f2|\u53f2]]}}\n| ''si2''\n| high rising\n| \"history\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u5f12|\u5f12]]}}\n| ''si3''\n| mid level\n| \"to assassinate\"\n|-\n|{{lang|zh-Hans|[[wiktionary:\u65f6|\u65f6]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u6642|\u6642]]}}\n| ''si4''\n| low falling\n| \"time\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u5e02|\u5e02]]}}\n| ''si5''\n| low rising\n| \"market\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u662f|\u662f]]}}\n| ''si6''\n| low level\n| \"yes\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u8272|\u8272]]}}\n| ''sik1''\n| high level (stopped)\n| \"color\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u9521|\u9521]]}}/{{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u932b|\u932b]]}}\n| ''sik3''\n| mid level (stopped)\n| \"tin\"\n|-\n| {{lang|zh-Hant|[[wiktionary:\u98df|\u98df]]}}\n| ''sik6''\n| low level (stopped)\n| \"to eat\"\n|}\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Chinese grammar}}\n{{See also|Chinese classifiers}}\nChinese is often described as a \"monosyllabic\" language. However, this is only partially correct. It is largely accurate when describing [[Classical Chinese]] and [[Middle Chinese]]; in Classical Chinese, for example, perhaps 90% of words correspond to a single syllable and a single character. In the modern varieties, it is usually the case that a [[morpheme]] (unit of meaning) is a single syllable; In contrast, English has plenty of multi-syllable morphemes, both bound and free, such as \"seven\", \"elephant\", \"para-\" and \"-able\".\n\nSome of the conservative southern varieties of modern Chinese have largely monosyllabic words, especially among the more basic vocabulary. In modern Mandarin, however, most [[noun]]s, [[adjective]]s and [[verb]]s are largely disyllabic. A significant cause of this is [[Phonetic erosion|phonological attrition]]. [[Sound change]] over time has steadily reduced the number of possible syllables. In modern Mandarin, there are now only about 1,200 possible syllables, including tonal distinctions, compared with about 5,000 in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (still largely monosyllabic) and over 8,000 in English.{{efn|name=DeFrancis p42}}\n\nThis phonological collapse has led to a corresponding increase in the number of [[homophone]]s. As an example, the small Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary<ref>{{cite book |title= Langenscheidt Pocket Chinese Dictionary |editor-first= Peter |editor-last= Terrell |publisher= Langenscheidt KG |location= Berlin and Munich |year= 2005 |isbn= 1-58573-057-2}}</ref> lists six words that are commonly pronounced as ''sh\u00ed'' (tone 2): \u5341 \"ten\"; \u5b9e/\u5be6 \"real, actual\"; \u8bc6/\u8b58 \"know (a person), recognize\"; \u77f3 \"stone\"; \u65f6/\u6642 \"time\"; \u98df \"food, eat\". These were all pronounced differently in [[Early Middle Chinese]]; in [[Baxter's transcription for Middle Chinese|William H. Baxter's transcription]] they were ''dzyip'', ''zyit'', ''syik'', ''dzyek'', ''dzyi'' and ''zyik'' respectively. They are still pronounced differently in today's [[Cantonese]]; in [[Jyutping]] they are ''sap9'', ''sat9'', ''sik7'', ''sek9'', ''si4'', ''sik9''. In modern spoken Mandarin, however, tremendous ambiguity would result if all of these words could be used as-is; [[Yuen Ren Chao]]'s modern poem [[Lion-Eating Poet in the Stone Den]] exploits this, consisting of 92 characters all pronounced ''shi''. As such, most of these words have been replaced (in speech, if not in writing) with a longer, less-ambiguous compound. Only the first one, \u5341 \"ten\", normally appears as such when spoken; the rest are normally replaced with, respectively, ''sh\u00edj\u00ec'' \u5b9e\u9645/\u5be6\u969b (lit. \"actual-connection\"); ''r\u00e8nshi'' \u8ba4\u8bc6/\u8a8d\u8b58 (lit. \"recognize-know\"); ''sh\u00edtou'' \u77f3\u5934/\u77f3\u982d (lit. \"stone-head\"); ''sh\u00edji\u0101n'' \u65f6\u95f4/\u6642\u9593 (lit. \"time-interval\"); ''sh\u00edw\u00f9'' \u98df\u7269 (lit. \"food-thing\"). In each case, the homophone was disambiguated by adding another morpheme, typically either a synonym or a generic word of some sort (for example, \"head\", \"thing\"), the purpose of which is simply to indicate which of the possible meanings of the other, homophonic syllable should be selected.\n\nHowever, when one of the above words forms part of a compound, the disambiguating syllable is generally dropped and the resulting word is still disyllabic. For example, ''sh\u00ed'' \u77f3 alone, not ''sh\u00edtou'' \u77f3\u5934/\u77f3\u982d, appears in compounds meaning \"stone-\", for example, ''sh\u00edg\u0101o'' \u77f3\u818f \"plaster\" (lit. \"stone cream\"), ''sh\u00edhu\u012b'' \u77f3\u7070 \"lime\" (lit. \"stone dust\"), ''sh\u00edk\u016b'' \u77f3\u7a9f \"grotto\" (lit. \"stone cave\"), ''sh\u00edy\u012bng'' \u77f3\u82f1 \"quartz\" (lit. \"stone flower\"), ''sh\u00edy\u00f3u'' \u77f3\u6cb9 \"petroleum\" (lit. \"stone oil\").\n\nMost modern varieties of Chinese have the tendency to form new words through disyllabic, trisyllabic and tetra-character [[compound word|compounds]]. In some cases, monosyllabic words have become disyllabic without compounding, as in ''k\u016blong'' \u7a9f\u7abf from ''k\u01d2ng'' \u5b54; this is especially common in [[Jin Chinese|Jin]].\n\nChinese [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] is strictly bound to a set number of [[syllable]]s with a fairly rigid construction. Although many of these single-syllable morphemes (''z\u00ec'', \u5b57) can stand alone as individual [[word (linguistics)|words]], they more often than not form multi-syllabic [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]], known as ''c\u00ed'' (\u8bcd/\u8a5e), which more closely resembles the traditional Western notion of a word. A Chinese ''c\u00ed'' (\"word\") can consist of more than one character-morpheme, usually two, but there can be three or more.\n\nFor example:\n* ''y\u00fan'' \u4e91/\u96f2 \u2013 \"cloud\"\n* ''h\u00e0nb\u01ceob\u0101o'', ''h\u00e0nb\u01ceo'' \u6c49\u5821\u5305/\u6f22\u5821\u5305, \u6c49\u5821/\u6f22\u5821 \u2013 \"hamburger\"\n* ''w\u01d2'' \u6211 \u2013 \"I, me\"\n* ''r\u00e9n'' \u4eba \u2013 \"people, human, mankind\"\n* ''d\u00ecqi\u00fa'' \u5730\u7403 \u2013 \"The Earth\"\n* ''sh\u01cendi\u00e0n'' \u95ea\u7535/\u9583\u96fb \u2013 \"lightning\"\n* ''m\u00e8ng'' \u68a6/\u5922 \u2013 \"dream\"\n\nAll varieties of modern Chinese are [[analytic language]]s, in that they depend on [[syntax]] (word order and sentence structure) rather than [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]\u2014i.e., changes in form of a word\u2014to indicate the word's function in a sentence.{{sfnp|Norman|1988|p=10}} In other words, Chinese has very few [[grammatical inflection]]s\u2014it possesses no [[Grammatical tense|tenses]], no [[grammatical voice|voices]], no [[number]]s (singular, plural; though there are plural markers, for example for personal pronouns), and only a few [[Article (grammar)|articles]] (i.e., equivalents to \"the, a, an\" in English).{{efn|A distinction is made between \u4ed6 as \"he\" and \u5979 as \"she\" in writing, but this is a 20th-century introduction, and both characters are pronounced in exactly the same way.}}\n\nThey make heavy use of [[grammatical particle]]s to indicate [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]]. In Mandarin Chinese, this involves the use of particles like ''le'' \u4e86 (perfective), ''h\u00e1i'' \u8fd8/\u9084 (\"still\"), ''y\u01d0j\u012bng'' \u5df2\u7ecf/\u5df2\u7d93 (\"already\"), and so on.\n\nChinese has a [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] [[word order]], and like many other [[languages of East Asia]], makes frequent use of the [[topic\u2013comment]] construction to form sentences. Chinese also has an extensive system of [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]] and [[measure word]]s, another trait shared with neighboring languages like [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Korean language|Korean]]. Other notable grammatical features common to all the spoken varieties of Chinese include the use of [[serial verb construction]], [[pro-drop language|pronoun dropping]] and the related [[null subject language|subject dropping]].\n\nAlthough the grammars of the spoken varieties share many traits, they do possess differences.\n\n== Vocabulary ==\nThe entire Chinese character corpus since antiquity comprises well over 20,000 characters, of which only roughly 10,000 are now commonly in use. However Chinese characters should not be confused with Chinese words. Because most Chinese words are made up of two or more characters, there are many more Chinese words than characters. A better term for a Chinese character would be [[morpheme]], as characters represent the smallest grammatical units, individual meanings, and/or syllables in the Chinese language.\n\nEstimates of the total number of Chinese words and phrases vary greatly. The ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'', a compendium of Chinese characters, includes 54,678 head entries for characters, including [[bone oracle]] versions. The ''[[Zhonghua Zihai]]'' (1994) contains 85,568 head entries for character definitions, and is the largest reference work based purely on character and its literary variants. The [[CC-CEDICT]] project (2010) contains 97,404 contemporary entries including idioms, technology terms and names of political figures, businesses and products. The 2009 version of the Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary (WDCD),<ref>Dr. Timothy Uy and Jim Hsia, Editors, ''Webster's Digital Chinese Dictionary \u2013 Advanced Reference Edition, July 2009</ref> based on [[CC-CEDICT]], contains over 84,000 entries.\n\nThe most comprehensive pure linguistic Chinese-language dictionary, the 12-volumed ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'', records more than 23,000 head Chinese characters and gives over 370,000 definitions. The 1999 revised ''[[Cihai]]'', a multi-volume encyclopedic dictionary reference work, gives 122,836 vocabulary entry definitions under 19,485 Chinese characters, including proper names, phrases and common zoological, geographical, sociological, scientific and technical terms.\n\nThe 7th (2016) edition of ''[[Xiandai Hanyu Cidian]]'', an authoritative one-volume dictionary on modern standard Chinese language as used in [[mainland China]], has 13,000 head characters and defines 70,000 words.\n\n=== Loanwords ===\nLike any other language, Chinese has absorbed a sizable number of loanwords from other cultures. Most Chinese words are formed out of native Chinese morphemes, including words describing imported objects and ideas. However, direct phonetic borrowing of foreign words has gone on since ancient times.\n\nSome early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] loanwords in Chinese have been proposed, notably {{linktext|\u871c}} ''m\u00ec'' \"honey\", {{linktext|\u72ee}}/{{linktext|\u7345}} ''sh\u012b'' \"lion,\" and perhaps also {{linktext|\u9a6c}}/{{linktext|\u99ac}} ''m\u01ce'' \"horse\", {{linktext|\u732a}}/{{linktext|\u8c6c}} ''zh\u016b'' \"pig\", \u72ac ''qu\u01cen'' \"dog\", and {{linktext|\u9e45}}/{{linktext|\u9d5d}} ''\u00e9'' \"goose\".{{efn|[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] s.v. \"[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-75039/Chinese-languages Chinese languages]\": \"Old Chinese vocabulary already contained many words not generally occurring in the other Sino-Tibetan languages. The words for 'honey' and 'lion', and probably also 'horse', 'dog', and 'goose', are connected with Indo-European and were acquired through trade and early contacts. (The nearest known Indo-European languages were Tocharian and Sogdian, a middle Iranian language.) A number of words have Austroasiatic cognates and point to early contacts with the ancestral language of Muong\u2013Vietnamese and Mon\u2013Khmer.\"; Jan Ulenbrook, ''Einige \u00dcbereinstimmungen zwischen dem Chinesischen und dem Indogermanischen'' (1967) proposes 57 items; see also Tsung-tung Chang, 1988 [http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp007_old_chinese.pdf Indo-European Vocabulary in Old Chinese].}}\nAncient words borrowed from along the [[Silk Road]] since [[Old Chinese]] include \u8461\u8404 ''p\u00fat\u00e1o'' \"[[grape]]\", \u77f3\u69b4 ''sh\u00edliu''/''sh\u00edli\u00fa'' \"[[pomegranate]]\" and \u72ee\u5b50/\u7345\u5b50 ''sh\u012bzi'' \"[[lion]]\". Some words were borrowed from Buddhist scriptures, including \u4f5b ''F\u00f3'' \"Buddha\" and \u83e9\u8428/\u83e9\u85a9 ''P\u00fas\u00e0'' \"bodhisattva.\" Other words came from nomadic peoples to the north, such as \u80e1\u540c ''h\u00fat\u00f2ng'' \"[[hutong]]\". Words borrowed from the peoples along the Silk Road, such as \u8461\u8404 \"grape,\" generally have [[Persia]]n etymologies. Buddhist terminology is generally derived from [[Sanskrit]] or [[P\u0101li]], the [[liturgical language]]s of [[North India]]. Words borrowed from the nomadic tribes of the [[Gobi]], Mongolian or northeast regions generally have [[Altaic]] etymologies, such as \u7435\u7436 ''p\u00edp\u00e1'', the Chinese lute, or \u916a ''l\u00e0o''/''lu\u00f2'' \"cheese\" or \"yoghurt\", but from exactly which source is not always clear.{{sfnp|Kane|2006|p=161}}\n\n=== Modern borrowings ===\n{{See also|Translation of neologisms into Chinese|Transcription into Chinese characters}}\nModern neologisms are primarily translated into Chinese in one of three ways: free translation (''[[calque]]'', or by meaning), phonetic translation (by sound), or [[phono-semantic matching|a combination of the two]]. Today, it is much more common to use existing Chinese morphemes to coin new words in order to represent imported concepts, such as technical expressions and [[international scientific vocabulary]]. Any [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]] etymologies are dropped and converted into the corresponding Chinese characters (for example, ''anti-'' typically becomes \"\u53cd\", literally ''opposite''), making them more comprehensible for Chinese but introducing more difficulties in understanding foreign texts. For example, the word ''telephone'' was loaned phonetically as \u5fb7\u5f8b\u98ce/\u5fb7\u5f8b\u98a8 (Shanghainese: ''t\u00e9l\u00edfon'' {{IPA|[t\u0259l\u026afo\u014b]}}, Mandarin: ''d\u00e9l\u01dcf\u0113ng'') during the 1920s and widely used in Shanghai, but later \u7535\u8bdd/\u96fb\u8a71 ''di\u00e0nhu\u00e0'' (lit. \"electric speech\"), built out of native Chinese morphemes, became prevalent (\u96fb\u8a71 is in fact from the Japanese {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u8a71}} ''denwa''; see below for more Japanese loans). Other examples include \u7535\u89c6/\u96fb\u8996 ''di\u00e0nsh\u00ec'' (lit. \"electric vision\") for television, \u7535\u8111/\u96fb\u8166 ''di\u00e0nn\u01ceo'' (lit. \"electric brain\") for computer; \u624b\u673a/\u624b\u6a5f ''sh\u01d2uj\u012b'' (lit. \"hand machine\") for mobile phone, \u84dd\u7259/\u85cd\u7259 ''l\u00e1ny\u00e1'' (lit. \"blue tooth\") for [[Bluetooth]], and \u7f51\u5fd7/\u7db2\u8a8c ''w\u01cengzh\u00ec'' (lit. \"internet logbook\") for blog in Hong Kong and Macau Cantonese. Occasionally half-transliteration, half-translation compromises are accepted, such as \u6c49\u5821\u5305/\u6f22\u5821\u5305 ''h\u00e0nb\u01ceob\u0101o'' (\u6f22\u5821 ''h\u00e0nb\u01ceo'' \"Hamburg\" + \u5305 ''b\u0101o'' \"bun\") for \"hamburger\". Sometimes translations are designed so that they sound like the original while incorporating Chinese morphemes ([[phono-semantic matching]]), such as \u62d6\u62c9\u673a/\u62d6\u62c9\u6a5f ''tu\u014dl\u0101j\u012b'' \"tractor\" (lit. \"dragging-pulling machine\"), or \u9a6c\u5229\u5965/\u99ac\u5229\u5967 M\u01cel\u00ec'\u00e0o for the video game character [[Mario]]. This is often done for commercial purposes, for example \u5954\u817e/\u5954\u9a30 ''b\u0113nt\u00e9ng'' (lit. \"dashing-leaping\") for [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] and \u8d5b\u767e\u5473/\u8cfd\u767e\u5473 ''S\u00e0ib\u01ceiw\u00e8i'' (lit. \"better-than hundred tastes\") for [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurants]].\n\nForeign words, mainly [[proper nouns]], continue to enter the Chinese language by transcription according to their pronunciations. This is done by employing Chinese characters with similar pronunciations. For example, \"Israel\" becomes \u4ee5\u8272\u5217 ''Y\u01d0s\u00e8li\u00e8'', \"Paris\" becomes \u5df4\u9ece ''B\u0101l\u00ed''. A rather small number of direct transliterations have survived as common words, including \u6c99\u53d1/\u6c99\u767c ''sh\u0101f\u0101'' \"sofa\", \u9a6c\u8fbe/\u99ac\u9054 ''m\u01ced\u00e1'' \"motor\", \u5e7d\u9ed8 ''y\u014dum\u00f2'' \"humor\", \u903b\u8f91/\u908f\u8f2f ''lu\u00f3ji''/''lu\u00f3j\u00ed'' \"logic\", \u65f6\u9ae6/\u6642\u9ae6 ''sh\u00edm\u00e1o'' \"smart, fashionable\", and \u6b47\u65af\u5e95\u91cc ''xi\u0113s\u012bd\u01d0l\u01d0'' \"hysterics\". The bulk of these words were originally coined in the Shanghai dialect during the early 20th century and were later loaned into Mandarin, hence their pronunciations in Mandarin may be quite off from the English. For example, \u6c99\u53d1/\u6c99\u767c \"sofa\" and \u9a6c\u8fbe/\u99ac\u9054 \"motor\" in Shanghainese sound more like their English counterparts. Cantonese differs from Mandarin with some transliterations, such as \u68b3\u5316 ''so<sup>1</sup> faa<sup>3*2</sup>'' \"sofa\" and \u6469\u6253 ''mo<sup>1</sup> daa<sup>2</sup>'' \"motor\".\n\nWestern foreign words representing Western concepts have influenced Chinese since the 20th century through transcription. From [[French language|French]] came \u82ad\u857e ''b\u0101l\u00e9i'' \"ballet\" and \u9999\u69df ''xi\u0101ngb\u012bn'', \"champagne\"; from [[Italian language|Italian]], \u5496\u5561 ''k\u0101f\u0113i'' \"caff\u00e8\". English influence is particularly pronounced. From early 20th century Shanghainese, many English words are borrowed, such as \u9ad8\u5c14\u592b/\u9ad8\u723e\u592b ''g\u0101o\u011brf\u016b'' \"golf\" and the above-mentioned \u6c99\u53d1/\u6c99\u767c ''sh\u0101f\u0101'' \"sofa\". Later, the United States [[soft power|soft influences]] gave rise to \u8fea\u65af\u79d1 ''d\u00edsik\u0113''/''d\u00eds\u012bk\u0113'' \"disco\", \u53ef\u4e50/\u53ef\u6a02 ''k\u011bl\u00e8'' \"cola\", and \u8ff7\u4f60 ''m\u00edn\u01d0'' \"mini [skirt]\". Contemporary colloquial Cantonese has distinct loanwords from English, such as \u5361\u901a ''kaa<sup>1</sup> tung<small>1</small>'' \"cartoon\", \u57fa\u4f6c ''gei<sup>1</sup> lou<sup>2</sup>'' \"gay people\", \u7684\u58eb ''dik<sup>1</sup> si<sup>6*2</sup>'' \"taxi\", and \u5df4\u58eb ''baa<sup>1</sup> si<sup>6*2</sup>'' \"bus\". With the rising popularity of the Internet, there is a current vogue in China for coining English transliterations, for example, \u7c89\u4e1d/\u7c89\u7d72 ''f\u011bns\u012b'' \"fans\", \u9ed1\u5ba2 ''h\u0113ik\u00e8'' \"hacker\" (lit. \"black guest\"), and \u535a\u5ba2 ''b\u00f3k\u00e8'' \"blog\". In Taiwan, some of these transliterations are different, such as \u99ed\u5ba2 ''h\u00e0ik\u00e8'' for \"hacker\" and \u90e8\u843d\u683c ''b\u00f9lu\u00f2g\u00e9'' for \"blog\" (lit. \"interconnected tribes\").\n\nAnother result of the English influence on Chinese is the appearance in Modern Chinese texts of so-called \u5b57\u6bcd\u8bcd/\u5b57\u6bcd\u8a5e ''z\u00ecm\u01d4c\u00ed'' (lit. \"lettered words\") spelled with letters from the English alphabet. This has appeared in magazines, newspapers, on web sites, and on TV: \u4e09G\u624b\u673a/\u4e09G\u624b\u6a5f \"3rd generation cell phones\" (\u4e09 ''s\u0101n'' \"three\" + G \"generation\" + \u624b\u673a/\u624b\u6a5f ''sh\u01d2uj\u012b'' \"mobile phones\"), IT\u754c \"IT circles\" (IT \"information technology\" + \u754c ''ji\u00e8'' \"industry\"), HSK (''H\u00e0ny\u01d4 Shu\u01d0p\u00edng K\u01ceosh\u00ec'', \u6c49\u8bed\u6c34\u5e73\u8003\u8bd5/\u6f22\u8a9e\u6c34\u5e73\u8003\u8a66), GB (''Gu\u00f3bi\u0101o'', \u56fd\u6807/\u570b\u6a19), CIF\u4ef7/CIF\u50f9 (CIF \"Cost, Insurance, Freight\" + \u4ef7/\u50f9 ''ji\u00e0'' \"price\"), e\u5bb6\u5ead \"e-home\" (e \"electronic\" + \u5bb6\u5ead ''ji\u0101t\u00edng'' \"home\"), W\u65f6\u4ee3/W\u6642\u4ee3 \"wireless era\" (W \"wireless\" + \u65f6\u4ee3/\u6642\u4ee3 ''sh\u00edd\u00e0i'' \"era\"), TV\u65cf \"TV watchers\" (TV \"television\" + \u65cf ''z\u00fa'' \"social group; clan\"), \u540e\u0420\u0421\u65f6\u4ee3/\u5f8cPC\u6642\u4ee3 \"post-PC era\" (\u540e/\u5f8c ''h\u00f2u'' \"after/post-\" + PC \"personal computer\" + \u65f6\u4ee3/\u6642\u4ee3), and so on.\n\nSince the 20th century, another source of words has been [[Japanese language|Japanese]] using existing [[kanji]] (Chinese characters used in Japanese). Japanese re-molded European concepts and inventions into {{nihongo|''[[wasei-kango]]''|\u548c\u88fd\u6f22\u8a9e||lit. \"Japanese-made Chinese\"}}, and many of these words have been re-loaned into modern Chinese. Other terms were coined by the Japanese by giving new senses to existing Chinese terms or by referring to expressions used in classical Chinese literature. For example, ''j\u012bngj\u00ec'' (\u7ecf\u6d4e/\u7d93\u6fdf; {{lang|ja|\u7d4c\u6e08}} ''keizai'' in Japanese), which in the original Chinese meant \"the workings of the state\", was narrowed to \"economy\" in Japanese; this narrowed definition was then re-imported into Chinese. As a result, these terms are virtually indistinguishable from native Chinese words: indeed, there is some dispute over some of these terms as to whether the Japanese or Chinese coined them first. As a result of this loaning, Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and Vietnamese share a corpus of linguistic terms describing modern terminology, paralleling the similar corpus of terms built from Greco-Latin and shared among European languages.\n\n== Writing system ==\n{{Main|Written Chinese|Mainland Chinese Braille|Taiwanese Braille}}\n<!--This is a SUMMARY.-->\n\nThe Chinese [[orthography]] centers on [[Chinese characters]], which are written within imaginary square blocks, traditionally arranged in vertical columns, read from top to bottom down a column, and right to left across columns. Chinese characters denote [[morpheme]]s independent of phonetic change. Thus the character [[wikt:\u4e00|\u4e00]] (\"one\") is uttered ''y\u012b'' in [[Standard Chinese]], ''yat<sup>1</sup>'' in [[Cantonese]] and ''it'' in [[Hokkien dialect|Hokkien]] (form of Min). Vocabularies from different major Chinese variants have diverged, and colloquial nonstandard written Chinese often makes use of unique \"dialectal characters\", such as \u5187 and \u4fc2 for Cantonese and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], which are considered archaic or unused in standard written Chinese.\n\nWritten colloquial Cantonese has become quite popular in online [[chat room]]s and [[instant messaging]] amongst Hong-Kongers and Cantonese-speakers elsewhere. It is considered highly informal, and does not extend to many formal occasions.\n\nThe Chinese had no uniform phonetic transcription system until the mid-20th century, although enunciation patterns were recorded in early [[rime book]]s and dictionaries. Early [[India]]n translators, working in [[Sanskrit]] and [[Pali]], were the first to attempt to describe the sounds and enunciation patterns of Chinese in a foreign language. After the 15th century, the efforts of Jesuits and Western court missionaries resulted in some rudimentary Latin transcription systems, based on the [[Nanjing Mandarin]] dialect.\n\nIn [[Hunan]], women in certain areas write their local language in [[N\u00fc Shu]], a [[syllabary]] derived from [[Chinese characters]]. The [[Dungan language]], considered by many a dialect of Mandarin, is nowadays written in [[Cyrillic]], and was previously written in the [[Arabic script]]. The [[Dungan people]] are primarily Muslim and live mainly in [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], and [[Russia]]; some of the related [[Hui people]] also speak the language and live mainly in China.\n\n=== Chinese characters ===\n{{Main|Chinese characters}}\n<!--This is a SUMMARY. Please add new information to [[Chinese characters]].-->\n\n[[File:XingshuLantingxv.jpg|thumb|right|\"[[Lantingji Xu|Preface to the Poems Composed at the Orchid Pavilion]]\" by [[Wang Xizhi]], written in [[Semi-cursive script|semi-cursive style]]]]\nEach Chinese character represents a monosyllabic Chinese word or morpheme. In 100 CE, the famed [[Han dynasty]] scholar [[Xu Shen]] [[Chinese character classification|classified characters]] into six categories, namely [[pictograph]]s, simple [[ideograph]]s, compound ideographs, phonetic loans, phonetic compounds and derivative characters. Of these, only 4% were categorized as pictographs, including many of the simplest characters, such as ''r\u00e9n'' {{lang|zh|\u4eba}} (human), ''r\u00ec'' {{lang|zh|\u65e5}} (sun), ''sh\u0101n'' {{lang|zh|\u5c71}} (mountain; hill), ''shu\u01d0'' {{lang|zh|\u6c34}} (water). Between 80% and 90% were classified as phonetic compounds such as ''ch\u014dng'' {{lang|zh|\u6c96}} (pour), combining a phonetic component ''zh\u014dng'' {{lang|zh|\u4e2d}} (middle) with a semantic [[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]] {{lang|zh|\u6c35}} (water). Almost all characters created since have been made using this format. The 18th-century [[Kangxi Dictionary]] recognized 214 radicals.\n\nModern characters are styled after the [[kaishu|regular script]]. Various other written styles are also used in [[Chinese calligraphy]], including [[seal script]], [[cursive script (East Asia)|cursive script]] and [[clerical script]]. Calligraphy artists can write in traditional and simplified characters, but they tend to use traditional characters for traditional art.\n\nThere are currently two systems for Chinese characters. The [[Traditional Chinese character|traditional system]], used in [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Macau]] and Chinese speaking communities (except [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]]) outside [[mainland China]], takes its form from standardized character forms dating back to the late Han dynasty. The [[Simplified Chinese character]] system, introduced by the People's Republic of China in 1954 to promote mass [[literacy]], simplifies most complex traditional [[glyph]]s to fewer strokes, many to common cursive [[shorthand]] variants.\n\n[[Singapore]], which has a large Chinese community, was the second nation to officially adopt simplified characters, although it has also become the ''de facto'' standard for younger ethnic Chinese in [[Malaysia]]. The [[Internet]] provides the platform to practice reading these alternative systems, be it traditional or simplified.\n\nA well-educated Chinese reader today recognizes approximately 4,000 to 6,000 characters; approximately 3,000 characters are required to read a [[Newspapers of the People's Republic of China|Mainland newspaper]]. The PRC government defines literacy amongst workers as a knowledge of 2,000 characters, though this would be only functional literacy. School-children typically learn around 2,000 characters whereas scholars may memorize up to 10,000.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zimmermann|first=Basile|year=2010|title=Redesigning Culture: Chinese Characters in Alphabet-Encoded Networks|journal=Design and Culture|volume=2|issue=1}}</ref> A large unabridged [[dictionary]], like the Kangxi Dictionary, contains over 40,000 characters, including obscure, variant, rare, and archaic characters; fewer than a quarter of these characters are now commonly used.\n\n=== Romanization ===\n[[File:Gwoyu.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.45|\"National language\" ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u570b\u8a9e}}/{{lang|zh-Hans|\u56fd\u8bed}}; ''Gu\u00f3y\u01d4'') written in Traditional and Simplified Chinese characters, followed by various romanizations.]]\n\n{{see also|Chinese language romanization in Singapore|Romanization of Chinese}}\n\n[[Romanization]] is the process of transcribing a language into the [[Latin script]]. There are many systems of romanization for the Chinese varieties, due to the lack of a native phonetic transcription until modern times. Chinese is first known to have been written in Latin characters by Western [[Christianity in China|Christian missionaries]] in the 16th century.\n\nToday the most common romanization standard for Standard Chinese is ''[[Hanyu Pinyin]]'', often known simply as pinyin, introduced in 1956 by the [[People's Republic of China]], and later adopted by [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]]. Pinyin is almost universally employed now for teaching standard spoken Chinese in schools and universities across [[Americas|America]], [[Australia]] and [[Europe]]. Chinese parents also use Pinyin to teach their children the sounds and tones of new words. In school books that teach Chinese, the Pinyin romanization is often shown below a picture of the thing the word represents, with the Chinese character alongside.\n\nThe second-most common romanization system, the [[Wade\u2013Giles]], was invented by Thomas Wade in 1859 and modified by Herbert Giles in 1892. As this system approximates the phonology of Mandarin Chinese into English consonants and vowels, i.e. it is an [[Anglicization]], it may be particularly helpful for beginner Chinese speakers of an English-speaking background. Wade\u2013Giles was found in academic use in the [[United States]], particularly before the 1980s, and until recently{{when|date=February 2011}} was widely used in Taiwan.\n\nWhen used within European texts, the [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] transcriptions in both pinyin and Wade\u2013Giles are often left out for simplicity; Wade\u2013Giles' extensive use of apostrophes is also usually omitted. Thus, most Western readers will be much more familiar with ''Beijing'' than they will be with ''B\u011bij\u012bng'' (pinyin), and with ''Taipei'' than ''T'ai\u00b2-pei\u00b3'' (Wade\u2013Giles). This simplification presents syllables as homophones which really are none, and therefore exaggerates the number of homophones almost by a factor of four.\n\nHere are a few examples of ''Hanyu Pinyin'' and Wade\u2013Giles, for comparison:<!-- Please feel free to add Yale, Postal or whatever other examples you know, but I don't know those systems.

The [['Phags-pa script]], for example, has been very helpful in reconstructing the pronunciations of premodern forms of Chinese.\n\n[[Zhuyin]] (colloquially ''bopomofo''), a [[semi-syllabary]] is still widely used in Taiwan's [[elementary school]]s to aid standard pronunciation. Although zhuyin characters are reminiscent of [[katakana]] script, there is no source to substantiate the claim that Katakana was the basis for the zhuyin system. A comparison table of zhuyin to pinyin exists in the [[Bopomofo#Comparison|zhuyin article]]. Syllables based on pinyin and zhuyin can also be compared by looking at the following articles:\n* [[Pinyin table]]\n* [[Zhuyin table]]\n\nThere are also at least two systems of [[cyrillization]] for Chinese.

It is useful in many branches of mathematics, including [[algebraic geometry]], [[number theory]], [[analytic combinatorics]], [[applied mathematics]]; as well as in [[physics]], including the branches of [[hydrodynamics]], [[thermodynamics]], and particularly [[quantum mechanics]]. By extension, use of complex analysis also has applications in engineering fields such as [[nuclear engineering|nuclear]], [[aerospace engineering|aerospace]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[electrical engineering]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nAs a [[derivative|differentiable function]] of a complex variable is equal to the sum of its [[Taylor series]] (that is, it is [[analytic function|analytic]]), complex analysis is particularly concerned with analytic functions of a complex variable (that is, [[holomorphic function]]s).\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Mandel zoom 00 mandelbrot set.jpg|right|262px|thumb|The [[Mandelbrot set]], a [[fractal]]]]\nComplex analysis is one of the classical branches in mathematics, with roots in the 18th century and just prior. Important mathematicians associated with complex numbers include [[Euler]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Riemann]], [[Cauchy]], [[Weierstrass]], and many more in the 20th century. Complex analysis, in particular the theory of [[conformal mapping]]s, has many physical applications and is also used throughout [[analytic number theory]]. In modern times, it has become very popular through a new boost from [[complex dynamics]] and the pictures of [[fractal]]s produced by iterating [[holomorphic functions]].  Another important application of complex analysis is in [[string theory]] which studies conformal invariants in [[quantum field theory]].\n\n== Complex functions ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Complex plane]] -->\nA complex function is a function whose [[domain (mathematics)#Domain of a function|domain]] and [[range (mathematics)|range]] are [[subset]]s of the [[complex plane]]. This is also expressed by saying that the [[independent variable]] and the [[dependent variable]] both are complex numbers.\n\nFor any complex function, the values <math>z</math> from the domain and their images <math>f(z)</math> in the range may be separated into [[Real number|real]] and [[Imaginary number|imaginary]] parts:\n\n: <math>z=x+iy \\quad</math> and <math> \\quad f(z) = f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)</math>,\n\nwhere <math>x,y,u(x,y),v(x,y)</math> are all real-valued.  \n\nIn other words, a complex function <math>f:\\mathbb{C}\\to\\mathbb{C}</math> may be decomposed into \n\n: <math>u:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to\\mathbb{R} \\quad</math> and <math>\\quad v:\\mathbb{R}^2\\to\\mathbb{R},</math>\n\ni.e., into two real-valued functions (<math>u</math>, <math>v</math>) of two real variables (<math>x</math>, <math>y</math>).\n\nThe basic concepts of complex analysis are often introduced by extending the elementary [[real function]]s (e.g., [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithmic function]]s, and [[trigonometric function]]s) into a complex domain and the corresponding complex range.\n\n== Holomorphic functions ==\n{{main|Holomorphic function}}\nComplex functions that are [[differentiable function|differentiable]] at every point of an [[open set|open subset]] <math>\\Omega</math> of the complex plane are said to be ''holomorphic'' ''on'' <math>\\Omega</math>.  In the context of complex analysis, the derivative of <math>f</math> at <math>z_0</math> is defined to be  <blockquote><math>f'(z_0)=\\lim_{z\\to z_0} \\frac{f(z)-f(z_0)}{z-z_0},z\\in\n\\mathbb{C}</math>.</blockquote>Superficially, this definition is formally analogous to that of the derivative of a real function.  However, complex derivatives and differentiable functions behave in significantly different ways compared to their real counterparts.  In particular, for this limit to exist, the value of the difference quotient must approach the same complex number, regardless of the manner in which we approach <math>z_0</math> in the complex plane.  Consequently, complex differentiability has much stronger implications than real differentiability. For instance, holomorphic functions are [[infinitely differentiable]], whereas the existence of the ''n''th derivative need not imply the existence of the (''n'' + 1)th derivative for real functions.  Furthermore, all holomorphic functions satisfy the stronger condition of [[analytic function|analyticity]], meaning that the function is, at every point in its domain, locally given by a convergent power series. In essence, this means that functions holomorphic on <math>\\Omega</math> can be approximated arbitrarily well by polynomials in some neighborhood of every point in <math>\\Omega</math>. This stands in sharp contrast to differentiable real functions; even [[non-analytic smooth function#A smooth function which is nowhere real analytic|infinitely differentiable real functions can be ''nowhere'' analytic]].\n\nMost elementary functions, including the [[exponential function]], the [[trigonometric function]]s, and all [[polynomial|polynomial functions]], extended appropriately to complex arguments as functions <math>\\mathbb{C}\\to\\mathbb{C}</math>, are holomorphic over the entire complex plane, making them ''entire'' ''functions'', while rational functions <math>p/q</math>, where ''p'' and ''q'' are polynomials, are holomorphic on domains that exclude points where ''q'' is zero.  Such functions that are holomorphic everywhere except a set of isolated points are known as ''meromorphic functions''.  On the other hand, the functions <math>z\\mapsto \\Re(z)</math>, <math>z\\mapsto |z|</math>, and <math>z\\mapsto \\bar{z}</math> are not holomorphic anywhere on the complex plane, as can be shown by their failure to satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann conditions (see below).\n\nAn important property that characterizes holomorphic functions is the relationship between the partial derivatives of their real and imaginary components, known as the [[Cauchy-Riemann conditions]].  If <math>f:\\mathbb{C}\\to\\mathbb{C}</math>, defined by <math>f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+iv(x,y)</math>, where <math>x,y, u(x,y),v(x,y)\\in\\mathbb{R}</math>, is holomorphic on a [[Region (mathematics)|region]] <math>\\Omega</math>, then ''<math>(\\partial f/\\partial \\bar{z})(z_0)= 0</math>'' must hold for all <math>z_0\\in \\Omega</math>.  Here, the differential operator <math>\\partial/\\partial\\bar{z} </math> is defined as <math>(1/2)(\\partial/\\partial x+i\\partial/\\partial y) </math>''.''  In terms of the real and imaginary parts of the function, ''u'' and ''v'', this is equivalent to the pair of equations <math>u_x = v_y</math> and <math>u_y=-v_x</math>, where the subscripts indicate partial differentiation.  However, it is important to note that functions satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann conditions are not necessarily holomorphic, unless additional continuity conditions are met (see [[Looman\u2013Menchoff theorem|Looman-Menchoff Theorem]] for a discussion).\n\nHolomorphic functions exhibit some remarkable features.  For instance, [[Picard theorem|Picard's theorem]] asserts that the range of an entire function can only take three possible forms: <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, <math>\\mathbb{C}\\setminus\\{z_0\\}</math>, or <math>\\{z_0\\}</math> for some <math>z_0\\in\\mathbb{C}</math>.  In other words, if two distinct complex numbers <math>z</math> and <math>w</math> are not in the range of entire function <math>f</math>, then <math>f</math> is a constant function.  Moreover, given a holomorphic function <math>f</math> defined on an open set <math>U</math>, the [[analytic continuation]] of <math>f</math> to a larger open set <math>V\\supset U</math> is unique.  As a result, the value of a holomorphic function over an arbitrarily small region in fact determines the value of the function everywhere to which it can be extended as a holomorphic function.\n\n''See also'': [[analytic function]], [[coherent sheaf]] and [[vector bundle]]s.\n\n== Major results ==\nOne of the central tools in complex analysis is the [[line integral]]. The line integral around a closed path of a function that is holomorphic everywhere inside the area bounded by the closed path is always zero, which is what the [[Cauchy integral theorem]] states. The values of such a holomorphic function inside a disk can be computed by a path integral on the disk's boundary (as shown in [[Cauchy's integral formula]]). Path integrals in the complex plane are often used to determine complicated real integrals, and here the theory of [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]]s among others is applicable (see [[methods of contour integration]]). A \"pole\" (or [[isolated singularity]]) of a function is a point where the function's value becomes unbounded, or \"blows up\". If a function has such a pole, then one can compute the function's residue there, which can be used to compute path integrals involving the function; this is the content of the powerful [[residue theorem]]. The remarkable behavior of holomorphic functions near essential singularities is described by [[Picard theorem#Big Picard|Picard's Theorem]]. Functions that have only poles but no [[Essential singularity|essential singularities]] are called [[meromorphic]]. [[Laurent series]] are the complex-valued equivalent to [[Taylor series]], but can be used to study the behavior of functions near singularities through infinite sums of more well understood functions, such as polynomials.\n\nA [[bounded function]] that is holomorphic in the entire complex plane must be constant; this is [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]]. It can be used to provide a natural and short proof for the [[Fundamental Theorem of Algebra|fundamental theorem of algebra]] which states that the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of complex numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]].\n\nIf a function is holomorphic throughout a [[Connected space|connected]] domain then its values are fully determined by its values on any smaller subdomain.  The function on the larger domain is said to be [[analytic continuation|analytically continued]] from its values on the smaller domain.  This allows the extension of the definition of functions, such as the [[Riemann zeta function]], which are initially defined in terms of infinite sums that converge only on limited domains to almost the entire complex plane.  Sometimes, as in the case of the [[natural logarithm]], it is impossible to analytically continue a holomorphic function to a non-simply connected domain in the complex plane but it is possible to extend it to a holomorphic function on a closely related surface known as a [[Riemann surface]].\n\nAll this refers to complex analysis in one variable. There is also a very rich theory of [[several complex variables|complex analysis in more than one complex dimension]] in which the analytic properties such as [[power series]] expansion carry over whereas most of the geometric properties of holomorphic functions in one complex dimension (such as [[conformality]]) do not carry over. The [[Riemann mapping theorem]] about the conformal relationship of certain domains in the complex plane, which may be the most important result in the one-dimensional theory, fails dramatically in higher dimensions.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Analytic continuation]]\n* [[Complex dynamics]]\n* [[List of complex analysis topics]]\n* [[Monodromy theorem]]\n* [[Real analysis]]\n* [[Runge's theorem]]\n* [[Several complex variables]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*  [[Lars Ahlfors|Ahlfors, L.]], ''Complex Analysis, 3 ed.''

With thousands of years of continuous history, China is one of the world's oldest [[civilization]]s,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/country_profiles/1287798.stm |title=China country profile |publisher=BBC News |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010}}</ref> and is regarded as one of the [[Cradle of civilization|cradles of civilization]].<ref>''Cradles of Civilization-China: Ancient Culture, Modern Land'', Robert E. Murowchick, gen. ed. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1994</ref>\n\nThe [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046\u2013256 BC) supplanted the Shang, and introduced the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to justify their rule. The central Zhou government began to weaken due to external and internal pressures in the 8th century BC, and the country eventually splintered into smaller states during the [[Spring and Autumn period]]. These states became independent and warred with one another in the following [[Warring States period]]. Much of traditional [[Culture of China|Chinese culture]], [[Chinese literature|literature]] and [[Chinese philosophy|philosophy]] first developed during those troubled times.\n\nIn 221 BC [[Qin Shi Huang]] [[Qin's wars of unification|conquered the various warring states]] and created for himself the title of ''Huangdi'' or \"[[Emperor of China|emperor]]\" of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]], marking the beginning of imperial China. However, the oppressive government fell soon after his death, and was supplanted by the longer lived [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC\u2013220 AD). Successive dynasties developed [[Bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] systems that enabled the emperor to control vast territories directly. In the 21 centuries from 206 BC until AD 1912, routine administrative tasks were handled by a special elite of ''[[scholar-officials]]''. Young men, well-versed in calligraphy, history, literature, and philosophy, were carefully selected through difficult government examinations. China's last dynasty was the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (1644\u20131912), which was replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]] in 1912, and in the [[Mainland China|mainland]] by the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949, resulting in two ''[[de facto]]'' states claiming to be the [[One-China policy|legitimate government of all China]].\n\nChinese history has alternated between periods of political unity and peace, and periods of war and [[failed state]]hood \u2013 the most recent being the [[Chinese Civil War]] (1927\u20131949). China was occasionally dominated by steppe peoples, most of whom were eventually assimilated into the [[Han Chinese]] culture and population. Between eras of multiple kingdoms and warlordism, [[dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasties]] have ruled parts or all of China; in some eras control stretched as far as [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]], as at present. Traditional culture, and influences from other parts of Asia and the [[Western world]] (carried by waves of immigration, [[cultural assimilation]], expansion, and foreign contact), form the basis of the modern culture of China.\n\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n== Prehistory ==\n\n===Paleolithic (3.3 Ma ~ 12 ka) ===\n{{see also|List of Paleolithic sites in China}}\n\n{{multiple image| align = left | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer =| footer_align = left | image1 =  Linharaptor exquistus.jpg | width1 = 150| caption1  = [[Linheraptor]], a genus of dromaeosaurid dinosaur which lived in what is now China in the Late Cretaceous.| image2 = Tarbocosmo.jpg | width2 = 160| caption2  = [[Tarbosaurus]], a genus of tyrannosaurid theropod dinosaur that lived at the end of the Late Cretaceous Period.

Hence, as some scholars of China suggest, the Xia and the Shang can possibly refer to political entities that existed concurrently, just as the early Zhou is known to have existed at the same time as the Shang.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nAlthough written records found at Anyang confirm the existence of the Shang dynasty,<ref>{{citation\n  | chapter = Recent archaeological evidence relating to the origin of Chinese characters\n  | last = Cheung | first = Kwong-yue | others = trans.

For example, archaeological findings at [[Sanxingdui]] suggest a technologically advanced civilization culturally unlike Anyang. The evidence is inconclusive in proving how far the Shang realm extended from Anyang. The leading hypothesis is that Anyang, ruled by the same Shang in the official history, coexisted and traded with numerous other culturally diverse settlements in the area that is now referred to as [[China proper]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n=== Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BC) ===\n{{main|Zhou dynasty|Iron Age China}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | title = Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BC)\n | perrow = 2/2/2\n | caption_align = center\n | image1 = Zhou dynasty 1000 BC.png\n | caption1 = The approximate territory of the Zhou dynasty in China.\n | image2 = Wuwangfuchaimao.JPG\n | caption2 = [[Spear of Fuchai]]\n | image3 = You with zigzag thunder pattern.jpg\n | caption3 = [[Chinese bronzes|Bronze]] ritual vessel ([[You (vessel)|You]]), Western Zhou dynasty\n | image4 = Periodo primavera e autunno, ascia o alabarca (ge), V sec. ac..JPG\n | caption4 = [[Ji (polearm)|Ji]], a Chinese polearm combining a spear and dagger-axe, Zhou dynasty (1046\u2013256 BC)\n}}\n\nThe Zhou dynasty (1046 BC to approximately 256 BC) was the longest-lasting dynasty in Chinese history. By the end of the 2nd millennium BC, the Zhou dynasty began to emerge in the [[Yellow River]] valley, overrunning the territory of the Shang. The Zhou appeared to have begun their rule under a [[Feudalism|semi-feudal]] system. The Zhou lived west of the [[Shang]], and the Zhou leader had been appointed Western Protector by the Shang. The ruler of the Zhou, [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], with the assistance of his brother, the [[Duke of Zhou]], as regent, managed to defeat the Shang at the [[Battle of Muye]].\n\nThe king of Zhou at this time invoked the concept of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] to legitimize his rule, a concept that would be influential for almost every succeeding dynasty.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Like Shangdi, Heaven (''tian'') ruled over all the other gods, and it decided who would rule China.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} It was believed that a ruler had lost the Mandate of Heaven when natural disasters occurred in great number, and when, more realistically, the sovereign had apparently lost his concern for the people. In response, the royal house would be overthrown, and a new house would rule, having been granted the Mandate of Heaven.\n\nThe Zhou initially moved their capital west to an area near modern [[Xi'an]], on the [[Wei River]], a tributary of the Yellow River, but they would preside over a series of expansions into the [[Yangtze River]] valley. This would be the first of many population migrations from north to south in Chinese history.\n\n=== Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013476 BC) ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n{{main|Spring and Autumn period}}\n{{further|Chinese Iron Age}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | title = Spring and Autumn period (722\u2013476 BC)\n | perrow = 2/2/2\n | caption_align = center\n | image1 = Five Hegemons.png\n | caption1 = Map of the Five Hegemons during the Spring and Autumn period of Zhou Dynasty\n | image2 = Linzi_sewer_2010_06_06.jpg\n | caption2 = Remains of city sewer passing underneath the former city wall in [[Ancient Linzi]], Spring and Autumn period.\n | image3 = Sword of Goujian, Hubei Provincial Museum, 2015-04-06 07.jpg\n | caption3 = [[Sword of Goujian]], Hubei Provincial Museum\n | image4 = Sun Gao Bianzhong, picture4.jpg\n | caption4 = The Sun Gao Bianzhong, Spring and Autumn period (770-476 B.C.), excavated in 1978 from a tomb in Yingchuan, Henan.\n}}\n\n:''Capitals: [[several]] (multiple states)''\n\nIn the 8th century BC, power became decentralized during the [[Spring and Autumn period]], named after the influential ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''. In this period, local military leaders used by the Zhou began to assert their power and vie for [[hegemony]]. The situation was aggravated by the invasion of other peoples from the northwest, such as the [[Qin (state)|Qin]], forcing the Zhou to move their capital east to [[Luoyang]]. This marks the second major phase of the Zhou dynasty: the Eastern Zhou. The Spring and Autumn period is marked by a falling apart of the central Zhou power. In each of the hundreds of states that eventually arose, local strongmen held most of the political power and continued their subservience to the Zhou kings in name only. Some local leaders even started using royal titles for themselves. China now consisted of hundreds of states, some of them only as large as a village with a fort.\n\nAs the era continued, larger and more powerful states annexed or claimed suzerainty over smaller ones. By the 6th century BC most small states had disappeared from being annexed and just a few large and powerful principalities dominated China. Some southern states, such as Chu and Wu, claimed independence from the Zhou, who undertook wars against some of them (Wu and Yue). Many new cities were established in this period and Chinese culture was slowly shaped.\n\nOnce all these powerful rulers had firmly established themselves within their respective dominions, the bloodshed focused more fully on interstate conflict in the Warring States period, which began when the three remaining \u00e9lite families in the Jin state \u2013 Zhao, Wei and Han \u2013 partitioned the state. Many famous individuals such as [[Lao Zi]],  [[Confucius]] and [[Sun Tzu]] lived during this chaotic period.\n\nThe [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] of Chinese philosophy blossomed during this period, and such influential intellectual movements as [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] and [[Mohism]] were founded, partly in response to the changing political world. The first two philosophical thoughts would have an enormous influence on Chinese culture.\n\n=== Warring States period (476\u2013221 BC) ===\n{{main|Warring States period}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | title = Warring States period (476\u2013221 BC)\n | perrow = 2/2/2\n | caption_align = center\n | image1 = Streitende-Reiche2.jpg\n | caption1 = Map of the Warring States.

Though there remained a nominal [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] king until 256 BC, he was largely a figurehead and held little real power.\n\nNumerous developments were made during this period in culture and mathematics, examples include an important literary achievement, the [[Zuo Commentary]] on the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]], which summarizes the preceding Spring and Autumn period and the bundle of 21 bamboo slips from the [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips|Tsinghua]] collection, which was invented during this period dated to 305{{nbsp}} BC, are the worlds' earliest example of a two digit [[Tsinghua Bamboo Slips#Decimal multiplication table|decimal multiplication table]], indicating that sophisticated commercial arithmetic was already established during this period.<ref>''Nature''[http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-times-table-hidden-in-chinese-bamboo-strips-1.14482  The 2,300-year-old matrix is the world's oldest decimal multiplication table]</ref>\n\nAs neighboring territories of these warring states, including areas of modern [[Sichuan]] and [[Liaoning]], were annexed, they were governed under the new local administrative system of [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] and [[prefecture]]. This system had been in use since the Spring and Autumn period, and parts can still be seen in the modern system of [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|Sheng & Xian]] (province and county).\n\nThe final expansion in this period began during the reign of [[Ying Zheng]], the king of Qin. His unification of the other six powers, and further annexations in the modern regions of [[Zhejiang]], Fujian, [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]] in 214 BC, enabled him to proclaim himself the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]] (Qin Shi Huang).\n\n== Imperial China ==\n{{Redirect|Empire of China|the empire founded by Yuan Shikai|Empire of China (1915\u20131916)}}\nThe Imperial China Period can be divided into three subperiods: Early, Middle, and Late.\n\nMajor events in the Early subperiod include the Qin unification of China and their replacement by the Han, the First Split followed by the Jin unification, and the loss of north China. The Middle subperiod was marked by the Sui unification and their supplementation by the Tang, the Second Split, and the Song unification. The Late subperiod included the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.\n\n=== Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 BC) ===\n{{main|Qin dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 300\n | image_style = border:none;\n | title = Qin dynasty (221\u2013207 BC)\n | perrow=2/2/2\n | caption_align=center\n | image1 = Qin empire 210 BCE.jpg\n | caption1 = The territory of Qin dynasty, 210BCE.\n | image2 = Terracotta Army-China2.jpg\n | caption2 = The [[Terracotta Army]] of [[Qin Shi Huang]]\n | image3 = \u56db\u5ddd\u90fd\u6c5f\u58301.JPG\n | caption3 = [[Dujiangyan]], an irrigation project completed in 256 BC during the Warring States period of China by the State of Qin.\n | image4 = Great wall of qi 2008 07 14.jpg\n | caption4 = Ruins of the ancient [[Great Wall of Qi]] on Dafeng Mountain in the [[Changqing District]] of [[Jinan]], [[Shandong]] province, dated back to the [[Warring States period]]\n}}\n\nHistorians often refer to the period from Qin dynasty to the end of [[Qing dynasty]] as Imperial China. Though the unified reign of the [[Qin Shi Huang Di|First Qin Emperor]] lasted only 12 years, he managed to subdue great parts of what constitutes the core of the [[Han Chinese]] homeland and to unite them under a tightly centralized [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] government seated at [[Xianyang]] (close to modern [[Xi'an]]). The doctrine of Legalism that guided the Qin emphasized strict adherence to a legal code and the absolute power of the emperor. This philosophy, while effective for expanding the empire in a military fashion, proved unworkable for governing it in peacetime. The Qin Emperor presided over the brutal silencing of political opposition, including the event known as the [[burning of books and burying of scholars]]. This would be the impetus behind the later Han synthesis incorporating the more moderate schools of political governance.\n\n{{multiple image| align = left | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = [[Terracotta Army]] General (Left), Mid-rank officer of the Terracotta Army in [[Xi'an]] (Right)| footer_align = left | image1 = Terrakotta general 2010.jpg | width1 = 141| caption1  = | image2 = Terrakottaarm\u00e9n-13.jpg | width2 = 128| caption2  = }}\n\nMajor contributions of the Qin include the concept of a centralized government, and the unification and development of the legal code, the written language, measurement, and currency of China after the tribulations of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. Even something as basic as the length of axles for carts\u2014which need to match ruts in the roads\u2014had to be made uniform to ensure a viable trading system throughout the empire. Also as part of its centralization, the Qin connected the northern border walls of the states it defeated, making the first [[Great Wall of China]].\n\nA major Qin innovation{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} that lasted until 1912 was reliance upon a trained intellectual elite, the ''[[Scholar-official]]'' (\"Scholar-gentlemen\"). They were civil servants appointed by the Emperor to handle daily governance. Talented young men were selected through an elaborate process of [[imperial examination]]. They had to demonstrate skill at [[calligraphy]], and had to know Confucian philosophy. Historian Wing-Tsit Chan concludes that:\n:Generally speaking, the record of these scholar-gentlemen has been a worthy one. It was good enough to be praised and imitated in 18th century Europe. Nevertheless, it has given China a tremendous handicap in their transition from government by men to government by law, and personal considerations in Chinese government have been a curse.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles Alexander Moore, ed.|title=The Chinese Mind: Essentials of Chinese Philosophy and Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DoyN2h56ucC&pg=PA22|year=1967|publisher=U of Hawaii Press|page=22}}</ref>\n\nAfter Emperor Qin Shi Huang's unnatural death due to the consumption of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] pills,<ref name=\"wright\">{{cite book|title=The History of China|year=2001|author=Wright, David Curtis|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-30940-X|page=49}}</ref> the Qin government drastically deteriorated and eventually capitulated in 207 BC after the Qin capital was captured and sacked by rebels, which would ultimately lead to the establishment of a new dynasty of a unified China.<ref>Bodde 1986, p. 84</ref> Despite the short 15-year duration of the Qin dynasty, it was immensely influential on China and the structure of future Chinese dynasties.\n\n=== Han dynasty (202 BC\u2013AD 220) ===\n{{main|Han dynasty}}\n{{further|History of the Han dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 300\n | image_style = border:none;\n | title = Han dynasty (202 BC\u2013AD 220)\n | perrow = 2/2/2\n | caption_align = center\n | image1 = Han map.jpg\n | caption1 = The territory of Han dynasty, 2nd century CE.\n | image2 = Summer Vacation 2007, 263, Watchtower In The Morning Light, Dunhuang, Gansu Province.jpg\n | caption2 = The ruins of a Han-dynasty [[watchtower]] made of [[rammed earth]] at [[Dunhuang]], the eastern end of the [[Silk Road]].\n | image3 = Western Han Mawangdui Silk Map.JPG\n | caption3 = An early Western-Han silk map, depicting the Kingdom of [[Changsha]] and Kingdom of [[Nanyue]] in southern China.\n | image4 = Dahuting mural, Eastern Han Dynasty.jpg\n | caption4 = A mural showing women dressed in traditional ''[[Hanfu]]'' [[silk]] robes, [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] of the late [[Eastern Han dynasty]] (25\u2013220 AD), located in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan]] province, China\n}}\n\n====Western Han====\n\n[[File:Han Expansion.png|thumb|Map showing the expansion of Han dynasty in 2nd century BC.]]\n\nThe [[Han dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]], who emerged victorious in the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] that followed the fall of the [[Qin dynasty]]. A [[Pax Sinica|golden age]] in Chinese history, the Han dynasty's long period of stability and prosperity consolidated the foundation of China as a unified state under a central imperial bureaucracy, which was to last intermittently for most of the next two millennia. During the Han dynasty, territory of China was extended to most of the [[China proper]] and to areas far west. [[Confucianism]] was officially elevated to orthodox status and was to shape the subsequent Chinese civilization. Art, culture and science all advanced to unprecedented heights. With the profound and lasting impacts of this period of Chinese history, the dynasty name \"Han\" had been taken as the name of the Chinese people, now the [[Han Chinese|dominant ethnic group]] in modern China, and had been commonly used to refer to Chinese language and [[Chinese characters|written characters]]. The Han dynasty also saw many mathematical innovations being invented such as the method of [[Gaussian elimination]] which appeared in the Chinese mathematical text [[Rod calculus#System of linear equations|Chapter Eight ''Rectangular Arrays'']] of ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]''. Its use is illustrated in eighteen problems, with two to five equations. The first reference to the book by this title is dated to 179 AD, but parts of it were written as early as approximately 150 BC, more than 1500 years before the Europeans came up with the method in the 18th century.<ref>{{harvtxt|Calinger|1999}}, pp. 234\u2013236</ref><ref name=\"princeton\">{{cite book|author1=Timothy Gowers|author2=June Barrow-Green|author3=Imre Leader|title=The Princeton Companion to Mathematics|date=8 September 2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-11880-2|page=607}}<!-- |accessdate=28 September 2012 --></ref>\n\nAfter the initial [[Huang-Lao|Laissez-faire policies]] of Emperors [[Emperor Wen of Han|Wen]] and [[Emperor Jing of Han|Jing]], the ambitious [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] brought the empire to its zenith. To consolidate his power, Confucianism, which emphasizes stability and order in a well-structured society, was given exclusive patronage to be the guiding philosophical thoughts and moral principles of the empire. [[Taixue|Imperial Universities]] were established to support its study and further development, while other [[Hundred Schools of Thought|schools of thought]] were discouraged.\n\n{{multiple image| align = right | direction = horizontal | header = | header_align = left/right/center | footer = '''Left image''': Western-Han painted ceramic jar decorated with raised [[relief]]s of [[Chinese dragon|dragons]], [[Fenghuang|phoenixes]], and ''[[taotie]]''<br/> '''Right image''': Reverse side of a Western-Han [[TLV mirror|bronze mirror]] with painted designs of a flower motif| footer_align = left | image1 = China qing blue.JPG | width1 = 130| caption1  = | image2 = Bronze mirror with painted designs, Western Han.jpg| width2 = 120| caption2 = }}\n\n[[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|Major military campaigns]] were launched to weaken the nomadic [[Xiongnu Empire]], limiting their influence north of the Great Wall.

Economically, the state treasury was strained by excessive campaigns and projects, while land acquisitions by elite families gradually drained the tax base. Various [[consort clan]]s exerted increasing control over strings of incompetent emperors and eventually the dynasty was briefly interrupted by the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]].\n\n====Xin dynasty====\n\nIn AD 9, the usurper [[Wang Mang]] claimed that the [[Mandate of Heaven]] called for the end of the Han dynasty and the rise of his own, and he founded the short-lived [[Xin dynasty|Xin (\"New\") dynasty]]. Wang Mang started an extensive program of land and other economic reforms, including the outlawing of slavery and land nationalization and redistribution. These programs, however, were never supported by the landholding families, because they favored the [[peasant]]s. The instability of power brought about chaos, uprisings, and loss of territories. This was compounded by mass flooding of the [[Yellow River]]; silt buildup caused it to split into two channels and displaced large numbers of farmers. Wang Mang was eventually killed in [[Weiyang Palace]] by an enraged peasant mob in AD 23.\n\n====Eastern Han====\n\n[[File:\u4e1c\u6c49\u94dc\u5361\u5c3a.jpg|thumb|upright|A bronze caliper from the Eastern Han period.]]\n\n[[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Emperor Guangwu]] reinstated the Han dynasty with the support of landholding and merchant families at [[Luoyang]], ''east'' of the former capital [[Xi'an]].

The [[Xiongnu Empire]] was [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War#Final stages|decisively defeated]]. The diplomat and general [[Ban Chao]] further expanded the conquests across the [[Pamirs]] to the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]],<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/440601/Ban-Chao Ban Chao], Britannica Online Encyclopedia</ref> thus reopening the [[Silk Road]], and bringing trade, foreign cultures, along with the [[Chinese Buddhism#Traditional accounts|arrival of Buddhism]]. With extensive connections with the west, the first of several [[Romano-Chinese relations|Roman embassies to China]] were recorded in Chinese sources, coming from the sea route in AD 166, and a second one in AD 284.\n\nThe Eastern Han dynasty was one of the [[Science and technology of the Han dynasty|most prolific era of science and technology]] in ancient China, notably the historic invention of [[papermaking]] by [[Cai Lun]], and the numerous scientific and mathematical contributions by the famous [[polymath]] [[Zhang Heng]].\n\n=== Three Kingdoms (AD 220\u2013280) ===\n{{main|Three Kingdoms|}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Three Kingdoms (AD 220\u2013280)\n| image1 = China 5.jpg\n| caption1 = Three Kingdoms in 262, on the eve of the conquest of Shu, Wei, and Wu.\n| image2 = Cao Wei Dynasty fresco, Luoyang.jpg\n| caption2 = Fresco of a tomb in [[Luoyang]] dated to the [[Cao Wei]] period (220\u2013266 AD), showing seated men wearing ''[[Hanfu]]'' [[silk]] robes\n}}\n\nBy the 2nd century, the empire declined amidst land acquisitions, invasions, and feuding between [[consort clan]]s and [[Eunuch#China|eunuchs]]. The [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] broke out in AD 184, ushering in an era of [[warlord]]s. In the ensuing turmoil, three states tried to gain predominance in the period of the [[Three Kingdoms]]. This time period has been greatly romanticized in works such as ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]''.\n\nAfter [[Cao Cao]] reunified the north in 208, his son proclaimed the [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasty in 220. Soon, Wei's rivals [[Shu Han|Shu]] and [[Eastern Wu|Wu]] proclaimed their independence, leading China into the Three Kingdoms period. This period was characterized by a gradual decentralization of the state that had existed during the Qin and Han dynasties, and an increase in the power of great families.\n\nIn 266, the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] overthrew the Wei and later unified the country in 280, but this union was short-lived.\n\n===Jin dynasty (AD 266\u2013420)===\n{{main|Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Sixteen Kingdoms}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Jin dynasty (AD 266\u2013420)\n| image1 = Western Jeun Dynasty 280 CE.png\n| caption1 = [[Western Jin Dynasty]], c. 280 CE\n| image2 = Majishan entire hill 20090226.jpg\n| caption2 = View of Maijishan hill caves, grottoes and stairways.\n| image3 = P-leshenfu.jpg\n| caption3 = \"The Painting of Goddess Luo Rhapsody\"(in a part), Gu Kaizhi, Jin Dynasty\n| image4 = China400ce.png\n| caption4 = [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]] (Yellow), c.\u2009400 CE\n}}\n\nThe Jin dynasty was severely weakened by [[War of the Eight Princes|internecine fighting among imperial princes]] and lost control of northern China after [[Five Barbarians|non-Han Chinese settlers]] [[Uprising of the Five Barbarians|rebelled]] and captured Luoyang and Chang\u2019an.  In 317, a [[Emperor Yuan of Jin|Jin prince]] in modern-day [[Nanjing]] became emperor and continued the dynasty, now known as the Eastern Jin, which held southern China for another century. Prior to this move, historians refer to the Jin dynasty as the Western Jin.\n\nNorthern China fragmented into a series of [[Sixteen Kingdoms|independent kingdoms]], most of which were founded by [[Xiongnu]], [[Xianbei]], [[Jie people|Jie]], [[Di (Five Barbarians)|Di]] and [[Qiang (historical people)|Qiang]] rulers.  These non-Han peoples were ancestors of the [[Turkic people|Turks]], [[Mongols]], and [[Tibetans]]. Many had, to some extent, been \"[[Sinicization|sinicized]]\" long before their ascent to power. In fact, some of them, notably the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] and the Xiongnu, had already been allowed to live in the frontier regions within the Great Wall since late Han times.  During the period of the [[Sixteen Kingdoms]], warfare ravaged the north and prompted large-scale Han Chinese migration south to the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] Basin and Delta.\n\n=== Northern and Southern dynasties (AD 420\u2013589) ===\n{{main|Northern and Southern dynasties}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Northern and Southern dynasties (AD 420\u2013589)\n| image1 = Southern and Northern Dynasties 440 CE.png\n| caption1 = Southern and Northern Dynasties, 440 CE\n| image2 = Hanging Monastery 02.JPG\n| caption2 = [[Hanging Monastery]], a temple with the combination of [[Taoism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].\n| image3 = Yungang5 2010.JPG\n| caption3 = [[Yungang Grottoes]], an ancient Chinese Buddhist temple grottoes near the city of Datong in the province of [[Shanxi]].\n| image4 = Jiucenglou of Mogao Caves.jpg\n| caption4 = [[Mogao Caves]], also known as the Thousand Buddha Grottoes, located at a religious and cultural crossroads on the [[Silk Road]], in [[Gansu province]].\n}}\n\nIn the early 5th century, China entered a period known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, in which parallel regimes ruled the northern and southern halves of the country.  In the south, the Eastern Jin gave way to the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] and finally [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]. Each of these Southern dynasties were led by Han Chinese ruling families and used [[Jiankang]] (modern Nanjing) as the capital. They held off attacks from the north and preserved many aspects of Chinese civilization, while northern barbarian regimes began to [[sinify]].\n\nIn the north, the last of the Sixteen Kingdoms was extinguished in 439 by the [[Northern Wei]], a kingdom founded by the [[Xianbei]], a nomadic people who unified northern China. The Northern Wei eventually split into the [[Eastern Wei|Eastern]] and [[Western Wei]], which then became the [[Northern Qi]] and [[Northern Zhou]]. These regimes were dominated by Xianbei or Han Chinese who had married into Xianbei families. During this period most Xianbei people adopted Han surnames, eventually leading to complete assimilation into the Han.\n\nDespite the division of the country, Buddhism spread throughout the land. In southern China, fierce debates about whether [[Buddhism]] should be allowed were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. By the end of the era, Buddhists and [[Taoist]]s had become much more tolerant of each other.\n\n===Sui dynasty (581\u2013618)===\n{{main|Sui dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Sui dynasty (581\u2013618)\n| image1 = Cheui Dynasty 581 CE.png\n| caption1 = Sui dynasty c.609\n| image2 = 1400\u5e74\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u8d75\u5dde\u6865 zhao zhou qiao - panoramio.jpg\n| caption2 = The [[Anji Bridge]], the world's oldest open-spandrel segmental arch bridge of stone construction.\n| image3 = Tianlongshan Grotto - Manshan Pavillion, Taiyuan, Shanxi.JPG\n| caption3 = Manshan Pavilion of the [[Tianlongshan Grottoes]]\n| image4 = Sui Yangdi Tang.jpg\n| caption4 = Yang Guang depicted as Emperor of Sui\n}}\n\nThe short-lived [[Sui dynasty]] was a pivotal period in Chinese history. Founded by [[Emperor Wen of Sui|Emperor Wen]] in 581 in succession of the [[Northern Zhou]], the Sui went on to conquer the [[Chen dynasty|Southern Chen]] in 589 to reunify China, ending three centuries of political division. The Sui pioneered many new institutions, including the government system of [[Three Departments and Six Ministries]], [[imperial examination]]s for selecting officials from commoners, while improved on the systems of [[fubing system]] of the army conscription and the [[Equal-field system]] of land distributions. These policies, which were adopted by later dynasties, brought enormous population growth, and amassed excessive wealth to the state. [[Ancient Chinese coinage|Standardized coinage]] were enforced throughout the unified empire. Buddhism took root as a prominent religion and was supported officially. Sui China was known for its numerous mega-construction projects. Intended for grains shipment and transporting troops, the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] was constructed, linking the capitals [[Chang'an|Daxing (Chang'an)]] and [[Luoyang]] to the wealthy [[Southeastern China|southeast region]], and in another route, to the northeast border. The [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] was also expanded, while series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers further pacified its borders. However, the massive invasions of the [[Korean Peninsula]] during the [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War]] failed disastrously, triggering widespread revolts that led to [[transition from Sui to Tang|the fall of the dynasty]].\n\n===Tang dynasty (AD 618\u2013907)===\n{{main|Tang dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Tang dynasty (AD 618\u2013907)\n| image1 = Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png\n| caption1 = Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE\n| image2 = \u6cb3\u5357 \u6d1b\u9633 \u9f99\u95e8\u77f3\u7a9f - panoramio.jpg\n| caption2 = The Fengxian cave (c. 675 AD) of the [[Longmen Grottoes]], commissioned by [[Wu Zetian]].\n| image3 = \u6d1b\u9633\u9f99\u95e8\u77f3\u7a9f\uff0cLuo Yang Dragon Gate Grottoes - panoramio (9).jpg\n| caption3 = Inside a cave of [[Longmen Grottoes]]\n| image4 = Dunhuang star map.jpg\n| caption4 = The [[Dunhuang map]] is to date the world's oldest complete preserved star atlas.\n}}\n\nThe [[Tang dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]] on 18 June 618. It was a [[Pax Sinica|golden age of Chinese civilization]] and considered to be the most prosperous period of China with significant developments in culture, art, literature, particularly [[Tang poetry|poetry]], and technology. Buddhism became the predominant religion for the common people. [[Chang'an]] (modern [[Xi'an]]), the national capital, was the [[List of largest cities throughout history|largest city in the world during its time]].<ref>Mark Edward Lewis, ''China's Cosmopolitan Empire: The Tang Dynasty'' (2012). [https://www.amazon.com/Chinas-Cosmopolitan-Empire-Dynasty-Imperial/dp/0674064011/  excerpt].</ref>\n\n[[File:Tang Protectorates.png|thumb|Map of the six major protectorates during Tang dynasty.]]\n\nThe second emperor, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]], is widely regarded as one of the greatest [[Emperor of China|emperors in Chinese history]], who had laid the foundation for the dynasty to flourish for centuries beyond his reign. Combined military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers were implemented to eliminate threats from nomadic tribes, extend the border, and submit neighboring states into [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|a tributary system]]. Military victories in the [[Tang dynasty in Inner Asia|Tarim Basin]] kept the [[Silk Road]] open, connecting Chang'an to Central Asia and areas far to the west. In the south, lucrative maritime trade routes began from port cities such as [[Guangzhou]]. There was extensive trade with distant foreign countries, and many foreign merchants settled in China, encouraging a cosmopolitan culture. The Tang culture and social systems were observed and imitated by neighboring countries, most notably, [[Nara period|Japan]]. Internally the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] linked the political heartland in Chang'an to the agricultural and economic centers in the eastern and southern parts of the empire. [[Xuanzang]], a Chinese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]], scholar, traveller, and translator who travelled to [[India]] on his own, and returned with, \"over six hundred Mahayana and Hinayana texts, seven statues of the Buddha and more than a hundred [[sarira]] relics.\"\n\nUnderlying the prosperity of the early Tang dynasty was a strong centralized bureaucracy with efficient policies. The government was organized as \"[[Three Departments and Six Ministries]]\" to separately draft, review, and implement policies. These departments were run by royal family members as well as [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar officials]] who were selected by [[imperial examination]]s. These practices, which matured in the Tang dynasty, were continued by the later dynasties, with some modifications.\n\nUnder the Tang \"[[equal-field system]]\" all land was owned by the Emperor and granted to people according to household size. Men granted land were conscripted for military service for a fixed period each year, a military policy known as the \"[[Fubing system]]\". These policies stimulated a rapid growth in productivity and a significant army without much burden on the state treasury. By the dynasty's midpoint, however, [[Standing army|standing armies]] had replaced conscription, and land was continuously falling into the hands of private owners.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = \uac10\uc740\uc0ac\uc9c0 \ub3d9\uc0bc\uce35\uc11d\ud0d1 \uc0ac\ub9ac\uc7a5\uc5c4\uad6c 02.jpg\n | caption1 = A gilt Buddhist reliquary with decorations of armored guards, from Silla, 7th-century\n | image2 = Gilt silver jar with pattern of dancing horses.jpg\n | caption2 = A Tang period [[gilding|gilt]]-silver jar, shaped in the style of northern [[nomad]]'s leather bag{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=127}} decorated with a [[domestication of the horse|horse]] dancing with a cup of wine in its mouth, as the horses of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] were trained to do.{{sfn|Ebrey|1999|p=127}}\n}}\n\nThe dynasty continued to flourish under the rule of Empress [[Wu Zetian]], the only [[empress regnant]] in Chinese history, and reached its zenith during the long reign of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who oversaw an empire that stretched from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to the [[Aral Sea]] with at least 50 million people.

Upon suppression of the rebellion, regional military governors, known as [[Jiedushi]], gained increasingly autonomous status. With loss of revenue from land tax, the central imperial government relied heavily on [[Salt in Chinese history|salt monopoly]].  Externally, former submissive states raided the empire and the vast border territories were irreversibly lost for subsequent centuries. Nevertheless, civil society recovered and thrived amidst the weakened imperial bureaucracy.\n\nIn late Tang period, the empire was worn out by recurring revolts of [[Jiedushi|regional warlords]], while internally, as scholar-officials engaged in fierce [[Niu\u2013Li factional strife|factional strife]], corrupted [[eunuchs]] [[Sweet Dew incident|amassed immense power]]. Catastrophically, the [[Huang Chao Rebellion]], from 874 to 884, devastated the entire empire for a decade. The sack of the southern port [[Guangzhou]] in 879 was followed by the [[Guangzhou massacre|massacre]] of most of its inhabitants, along with the large foreign merchant enclaves.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Gabriel Ferrand |year=1922 |title=Voyage du marchand arabe Sulaym\u00e2n en Inde et en Chine, r\u00e9dig\u00e9 en 851, suivi de remarques par Ab\u00fb Zayd Hasan (vers 916) |page=76}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/judaism/kaifung.html |title=Kaifung Jews |publisher=University of Cumbria, Division of Religion and Philosophy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028113532/http://philtar.ucsm.ac.uk/encyclopedia/judaism/kaifung.html |archivedate=28 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By 881, both capitals, [[Luoyang]] and [[Chang'an]], fell successively.

The empire reached its greatest size prior to the Manchu Qing dynasty, becoming the center of an East Asian world linked by religion, script, and many economic and political institutions.

During this half-century, China was in all respects a multi-state system. Five regimes, namely, (Later) [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Liang]], [[Later Tang|Tang]], [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Jin]], [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Han]] and [[Later Zhou|Zhou]], rapidly succeeded one another in control of the traditional Imperial heartland in northern China. Among the regimes, rulers of (Later) [[Later Tang|Tang]], [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|Jin]] and [[Later Han (Five Dynasties)|Han]] were [[Sinicization|sinicized]] [[Shatuo|Shatuo Turks]], which ruled over the ethnic majority of [[Han Chinese]]. More stable and smaller regimes of mostly ethnic [[Han Chinese|Han]] rulers coexisted in south and western China over the period, cumulatively constituted the \"Ten Kingdoms\".\n\nAmidst political chaos in the north, the strategic [[Sixteen Prefectures]] (region along today's [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]) were ceded to the emerging [[Liao dynasty|Khitan Liao dynasty]], which drastically weakened the defense of the [[China proper]] against northern nomadic empires. To the south, [[Vietnam]] [[Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (938)|gained lasting independence]] after [[Third Chinese domination of Vietnam|being a Chinese prefecture]] for [[Chinese domination of Vietnam|many centuries]]. With wars dominated in Northern China, there were mass southward migrations of population, which further enhanced the southward shift of cultural and economic centers in China. The [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period|era]] ended with the coup of [[Later Zhou]] general [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Zhao Kuangyin]], and the establishment the [[Song dynasty]] in 960, which eventually annihilated the remains of the \"Ten Kingdoms\" and reunified China.\n\n===Song, Liao, Jin, and Western Xia dynasties (AD 960\u20131234)===\n{{main|Song dynasty|Liao dynasty|Western Xia|Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)}}\n{{further|History of the Song dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Song, Liao, Jin, and Western Xia dynasties (AD 960\u20131234)\n| image1 = China - Song Dynasty-en.svg\n| caption1 = China during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]]\n| image2 = Song-Bodhisattva1.jpg\n| caption2 = A wooden [[Bodhisattva]] from the Song dynasty (960\u20131279).\n| image3 = Chinese Gunpowder Formula.JPG\n| caption3 = Earliest known [[History of gunpowder|written formula]] for [[gunpowder]], from the ''[[Wujing Zongyao]]'' of 1044 AD.\n| image4 = Very large crouching tiger cannon.jpg\n| caption4 = A giant \"squatting-tiger fire [[trebuchet]]\" located at the Wolongtai Great Wall section, Xinyang, Henan, China.\n}}\n\nIn 960, the [[Song dynasty]] was founded by [[Emperor Taizu of Song|Emperor Taizu]], with its capital established in [[Kaifeng]] (also known as [[Bianjing]]). In 979, the Song dynasty reunified most of the [[China proper]], while large swaths of the outer territories were occupied by [[Sinicization|sinicized]] [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]], which lasted from 907 to 1125, ruled over [[Manchuria]], [[Mongolia]], and parts of [[North China|Northern China]]. Meanwhile, in what are now the north-western Chinese provinces of [[Gansu]], [[Shaanxi]], and [[Ningxia]], the [[Tangut people|Tangut]] tribes founded the [[Western Xia|Western Xia dynasty]] from 1032 to 1227.\n\nAiming to recover the strategic [[Sixteen Prefectures]] lost in the [[Later Jin (Five Dynasties)|previous dynasty]], [[Battle of Gaoliang River|campaigns]] were launched against the [[Liao dynasty]] in the [[Emperor Taizong of Song|early Song period]], which all ended in failure. Then in 1004, the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] [[cavalry]] swept over the exposed [[North China Plain]] and reached the outskirts of [[Kaifeng]], forcing the Song's submission and then agreement to the [[Chanyuan Treaty]], which imposed heavy annual tributes from the Song treasury. The treaty was a significant reversal of Chinese dominance of the traditional [[imperial Chinese tributary system|tributary system]]. Yet the annual outflow of Song's silver to the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] was paid back through the purchase of Chinese goods and products, which expanded the Song economy, and replenished its treasury. This dampened the incentive for the Song to further campaign against the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]]. Meanwhile, this cross-border trade and contact induced further [[sinicization]] within the [[Liao dynasty|Liao Empire]], at the expense of its military might which was derived from its primitive nomadic lifestyle. Similar treaties and social-economical consequences occurred in Song's relations with the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]].\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | perrow = 2\n | image1 = Dingzhou Liaodi Pagoda 3.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Liaodi Pagoda]], Song dynasty (960\u20131279)\n | image2 = People's Republic of China Beijing Tianningsi Tianing Temple David McBride Photography-0045 02.jpg\n | caption2 = The Pagoda of [[Tianning Temple (Beijing)|Tianing Temple]], [[Liao Dynasty]] (1100-1120)\n | image3 = Hohhot White Pagoda 2.jpg\n | caption3 = The Ten Thousand Copies of the Huayan Sutra Pagoda, commonly known as the White Pagoda, Liao dynasty (907-1125)\n | image4 = Poyang Yongfu Si Ta 2017.11.25 10-04-37.jpg\n | caption4 = Poyang Yongfu Temple Pagoda, Song dynasty (960\u20131279)\n}}\n\nWithin the [[Liao dynasty|Liao Empire]], the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] tribes revolted against their overlords to establish the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in 1115. In 1125, the devastating [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] [[cataphract]] annihilated the [[Liao dynasty]], while remnants of [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] court members fled to Central Asia to found the [[Qara Khitai|Qara Khitai Empire (Western Liao dynasty)]]. [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|Jin's invasion of the Song dynasty]] followed swiftly. In 1127, [[Kaifeng]] was sacked, a massive catastrophe known as the [[Jingkang Incident]], ending the [[Northern Song dynasty]]. Later the [[Jurchen campaigns against the Song dynasty|entire north of China was conquered]]. The survived members of Song court regrouped in the new capital city of [[Hangzhou]], and initiated the [[Southern Song dynasty]], which ruled territories south of the [[Huai River]]. In the ensuing years, the territory and population of China were divided between the Song dynasty, the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] and the [[Western Xia|Western Xia dynasty]]. The era ended with the [[Mongol conquest]], as [[Western Xia]] fell in 1227, the [[Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty|Jin dynasty]] in 1234, and finally the [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|Southern Song dynasty]] in 1279.\n\nDespite its military weakness, the Song dynasty is widely considered to be the high point of classical Chinese civilization. The [[Economy of the Song dynasty|Song economy]], facilitated by technology advancement, had reached a level of sophistication probably unseen in world history before its time. The population soared to over 100 million and the living standards of common people improved tremendously due to improvements in rice cultivation and the wide availability of coal for production. The capital cities of [[Kaifeng]] and subsequently [[Hangzhou]] were both the [[List of largest cities throughout history|most populous cities]] in the world for their time, and encouraged vibrant civil societies unmatched by previous Chinese dynasties. Although land trading routes to the far west were blocked by nomadic empires, there were extensive [[Maritime Silk Route|maritime trade]] with neighbouring states, which facilitated the use of Song coinage as the de facto currency of exchange. Giant wooden vessels equipped with [[compass]]es travelled throughout the [[China Seas]] and northern [[Indian Ocean]]. The concept of [[insurance]] was practised by merchants to hedge the risks of such long-haul maritime [[shipment]]s. With prosperous economic activities, the historically first use of [[Jiaozi (currency)|paper currency]] emerged in the western city of [[Chengdu]], as a supplement to the existing copper [[coin]]s.\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 250\n| caption_align = center\n| title =\n| align = right\n| image1 = Suzhou (December 8, 2015) - 16.jpg\n| caption1 = [[Beisi Pagoda]], located at Bao'en Temple in [[Suzhou]], [[Jiangsu Province]].\n| image2 = \u666f\u5dde\u5854 Jingzhou Pagoda.JPG\n| caption2 = Jingzhou Pagoda, Song dynasty (960\u20131279)\n| image3 = Northern Chaoyang Pagoda 06 2015-09.jpg\n| caption3 = Northern Chaoyang Bagoda, located in [[Chaoyang, Liaoning|Chaoyang]], [[Liaoning Province]].

Inventions such as the hydro-mechanical astronomical clock, the first continuous and endless power-transmitting chain, [[woodblock printing]] and [[paper money]] were all invented during the Song dynasty.\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 2\n| total_width= 500\n| align = left\n| image1 = Song Dynasty Hydraulic Mill for Grain.JPG\n| image2 = \u6e05\u660e\u4e0a\u6cb3\u56fe.jpg\n| image3 = Qingming Festival 2.jpg\n| image4 = Leifeng Pagoda in the Southern Song Dynasty by Li Song.jpg\n| footer = City views of Song dynasty from paintings.

By the mid-to-late 13th century, the Chinese had adopted the dogma of [[Neo-Confucian]] philosophy formulated by [[Zhu Xi]]. Enormous literary works were compiled during the Song dynasty, such as the historical work, the ''[[Zizhi Tongjian]]'' (\"Comprehensive Mirror to Aid in Government\"). The invention of [[Woodblock print|movable-type printing]] further facilitated the spread of knowledge. Culture and the arts flourished, with grandiose artworks such as ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' and ''[[Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute]]'', along with great Buddhist painters such as the prolific [[Lin Tinggui]].\n\nThe [[Song dynasty]] was also a period of major innovation in the [[Military history|history of warfare]]. [[Gunpowder]], while invented in the [[Tang dynasty]], was first put into use in battlefields by the Song army, inspiring a succession of new [[firearm]]s and [[siege engine]]s designs. During the [[Southern Song dynasty]], as its survival hinged decisively on guarding the [[Yangtze]] and [[Huai River]] against the cavalry forces from the north, the first standing navy in China was assembled in 1132, with its [[admiral]]'s headquarters established at [[Dinghai]]. [[Paddle wheel|Paddle-wheel]] warships equipped with [[trebuchet]]s could launch [[Incendiary device|incendiary bombs]] made of [[gunpowder]] and lime, as recorded in Song's victory over the invading [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] forces at the [[Battle of Tangdao]] in the [[East China Sea]], and the [[Battle of Caishi]] on the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] in 1161.\n\nThe advances in civilization during the Song dynasty came to an abrupt end following the devastating [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|Mongol conquest]], during which the population sharply dwindled, with a marked contraction in economy. Despite viciously [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|halting Mongol advance]] for more than three decades, the Southern Song capital [[Hangzhou]] fell in 1276, followed by the final annihilation of the Song standing navy at the [[Battle of Yamen]] in 1279.\n\n=== Yuan dynasty (AD 1271\u20131368) ===\n{{main|Yuan dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Yuan dynasty (AD 1271\u20131368)\n| image1 = Miaoyingsi baita.jpg\n| caption1 = The White Stupa of [[Miaoying Temple]] in [[Beijing]].\n| image2 = Deva King of the East.jpg\n| caption2 = [[Four Heavenly Kings|Deva King of the East]] on the east wall of the [[Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass]].\n| image3 = Yuan chinese gun.jpg\n| caption3 = Yuan period bronze firearm on display at the [[Shaanxi History Museum]] in [[Xi'an]].\n| image4 = Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing plate 1287.jpg\n| caption4 = Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing wood plate, 1287 CE.\n}}\n\n[[File:MongolMap.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Mongol successor khanates]]\n\nThe [[Yuan dynasty]] was formally proclaimed in 1271, when the [[List of Mongol rulers|Great Khan of Mongol]], [[Kublai Khan]], one of the grandsons of [[Genghis Khan]], assumed the additional title of the [[Emperor of China]], and considered [[Division of the Mongol Empire|his inherited part]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] as a [[Chinese dynasty]]. In the preceding decades, the Mongols had conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] in Northern China, and the [[Southern Song dynasty]] fell in 1279 after a [[Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty|protracted and bloody war]]. The [[Mongols|Mongol]] Yuan dynasty became the first [[conquest dynasty]] in Chinese history to rule the entire [[China proper]] and [[List of ethnic groups in China|its population]] as an [[Mongols in China|ethnic minority]]. The dynasty also directly controlled the [[Mongolia]]n heartland and other regions, inheriting the largest share of territory of the [[Division of the Mongol Empire|divided Mongol Empire]], which roughly coincided with the modern area of China and nearby regions in [[East Asia]]. Further expansion of the empire was halted after defeats in the [[Mongol invasions of Japan|invasions of Japan]] and [[Mongol invasions of Vietnam|Vietnam]]. Following the previous [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]], the capital of Yuan dynasty was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (also known as [[Khanbaliq|Dadu]], modern-day [[Beijing]]). The [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] was reconstructed to connect the remote capital city to economic hubs in southern part of China, setting the precedence and foundation where [[Beijing]] would largely remain as the [[Historical capitals of China|capital]] of the successive regimes that unified China mainland.\n\nAfter the peace treaty in [[Kaidu\u2013Kublai war|1304]] that ended a series of [[Division of the Mongol Empire#Civil war|Mongols civil wars]], the emperors of the Yuan dynasty were upheld as the nominal [[Khagan|Great Khan]] ([[Khagan]]) of the greater [[Mongol Empire]] over other [[Khamag Mongol|Mongol Khanates]], which nonetheless remained [[Division of the Mongol Empire|de facto autonomous]]. The era was known as ''[[Pax Mongolica]]'', when much of the [[Asia|Asian continent]] was ruled by the Mongols. For the first and only time in history, the [[Silk Road|silk road]] was controlled entirely by a single state, facilitating the flow of people, trade, and cultural exchange. Network of roads and a [[Yam (route)|postal system]] were established to connect the vast empire. Lucrative maritime trade, developed from the previous [[Song dynasty]], continued to flourish, with [[Quanzhou]] and [[Hangzhou]] emerging as the largest ports in the world. Adventurous travelers from the far west, most notably the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], [[Marco Polo]], would have settled in China for decades. Upon his return, his detail [[The Travels of Marco Polo|travel record]] inspired generations of [[High Middle Ages|medieval Europeans]] with the splendors of the far East. The Yuan dynasty was the first ancient economy, where [[paper currency]], known at the time as [[Chao (currency)|Chao]], was used as the predominant medium of exchange. Its unrestricted issuance in the late Yuan dynasty inflicted [[hyperinflation]], which eventually brought the downfall of the dynasty.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = The Observatory, Dengfeng, 2015-09-24 08.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Dengfeng Observatory]], the first in a series of 27 astronomical observatories built in the early Yuan dynasty.\n | image2 = \u67cf\u6797\u7985\u5bfa\u820d\u5229\u5854 - panoramio.jpg\n | caption2 = The Pagoda of Bailin Temple, an octagonal-based brick pagoda built in 1330 during the reign of [[Jayaatu Khan Tugh Tem\u00fcr|Emperor Wenzong]], ruler of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty (1271\u20131368).\n}}\n\nWhile the Mongol rulers of the Yuan dynasty adopted substantially to Chinese culture, their [[sinicization]] was of lesser extent compared to earlier [[Conquest dynasty|conquest dynasties]] in Chinese history. For preserving racial superiority as the conqueror and ruling class, traditional nomadic customs and heritage from the [[Mongolian Steppe|Mongolian steppe]] were held in high regard. On the other hand, the Mongol rulers also adopted flexibly to a variety of cultures from many advanced civilizations within the [[Mongol Empire|vast empire]]. Traditional social structure and culture in China underwent immense transform during the Mongol dominance. Large group of [[Semu|foreign migrants]] settled in China, who enjoyed elevated social status over the majority [[Han Chinese]], while enriching Chinese culture with foreign elements. The class of [[Scholar-official|scholar officials]] and intellectuals, traditional bearers of elite Chinese culture, lost substantial social status. This stimulated the development of culture of the common folks. There were prolific works in [[zaju|zaju variety shows]] and [[Sanqu|literary songs]] ([[sanqu]]), which were written in a distinctive [[Yuan poetry|poetry style]] known as [[Qu (poetry)|qu]]. [[Novel]]s of vernacular style gained unprecedented status and popularity.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 250\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = \u4ee3\u53bf\u963f\u80b2\u738b\u5854.jpg\n | caption1 = The [[Ayuwang Pagoda|Ayuwang Stupa]] in northern [[Shanxi]], China.\n | image2 = Zhao guan Tower 2011-10.JPG\n | caption2 = A [[stupa]] on top of an arch (''crossing street tower''), is a common form of architecture during Yuan period.\n}}\n\nBefore the Mongol invasion, Chinese dynasties reported approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest had been completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Ping-ti |last= Ho | title=An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China | journal = \u00c9tudes Song | series= 1 | issue=1 | year=1970 | pages=33\u201353}}</ref> This major decline is not necessarily due only to Mongol killings. Scholars such as Frederick W. Mote argue that the wide drop in numbers reflects an administrative failure to record rather than an actual decrease; others such as [[Timothy Brook]] argue that the Mongols created a system of [[serfdom|enserfment]] among a huge portion of the Chinese populace, causing many to disappear from the census altogether; other historians including William McNeill and David Morgan consider that [[Plague (disease)|plague]] was the main factor behind the demographic decline during this period. In the 14th century China suffered additional depredations from epidemics of plague, estimated to have killed 25 million people, 30% of the population of China.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&topic=1 |title = Course: Plague |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118121009/http://chip.med.nyu.edu/course/view.php?id=13&topic=1 | archivedate = 18 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the Yuan dynasty, there was some general sentiment among the populace against the Mongol dominance. Yet rather than the nationalist cause, it was mainly strings of natural disasters and incompetent governance that triggered widespread peasant uprisings since the 1340s. After the [[Largest naval battle in history|massive naval engagement]] [[Battle of Lake Poyang|at Lake Poyang]], [[Hongwu Emperor|Zhu Yuanzhang]] prevailed over other rebel forces in the south. He proclaimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor|emperor]] and founded the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1368. The same year his northern expedition army captured the capital [[Khanbaliq]]. The Yuan remnants fled back to [[Mongolia]] and [[Northern Yuan dynasty|sustained the regime]]. Other [[Mongol Empire|Mongol Khanates]] in [[Central Asia]] continued to exist after the fall of [[Yuan dynasty]] in China.\n\n===Ming dynasty (AD 1368\u20131644)===\n{{main|Ming dynasty}}\n{{further|History of the Ming dynasty}}\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | header =\n | image1 = Dongyang Luzhai 2015.05.24 15-53-48.jpg\n | alt1 = Dongyang Luzhai\n | caption1 = Residence of the Lu Family in Dongyang, built in the Ming period.\n | image2 = XiAn CityWall DiLou.jpg\n | alt2 = XiAn CityWall DiLou\n | caption2 = [[Fortifications of Xi'an|City wall of Xi'an]], a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] built during the early Ming dynasty\n | image3 = Fenghuang old town.JPG\n | alt3 = Fenghuang old town\n | caption3 = [[Fenghuang County]], an ancient town that harbors many architectural remains of Ming and Qing styles.\n | image4 = Yixian Hongcun 2016.09.09 17-27-03.jpg\n | alt4 = Yixian Hongcun\n | caption4 = [[Hongcun]], a village in Yi County in the historical Huizhou region of southern Anhui Province.\n | image5 = Xinye-9.jpg\n | alt5 = Xinye\n | caption5 = [[Xinye Village|Xinye]], a village noted for its well-preserved Ming and Qing era architecture and ancient residential buildings.\n}}\n\nThe [[Ming dynasty]] was founded by [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] in 1368, who proclaimed himself as the [[Hongwu Emperor]].

Large urban centers, such as [[Nanjing]] and [[Beijing]], also contributed to the growth of private industry. In particular, small-scale industries grew up, often specializing in paper, silk, cotton, and porcelain goods. For the most part, however, relatively small urban centers with markets proliferated around the country. Town markets mainly traded food, with some necessary manufactures such as pins or oil.\n\nDespite the [[xenophobia]] and intellectual introspection characteristic of the increasingly popular new school of [[neo-Confucianism]], China under the early Ming dynasty was not isolated. Foreign trade and other contacts with the outside world, particularly Japan, increased considerably. Chinese merchants explored all of the Indian Ocean, reaching East Africa with the [[Treasure voyages|voyages of Zheng He]].\n\nThe [[Hongwu Emperor]], being the only founder of a [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasty]] who was also of peasant origin, had laid the foundation of a state that relied fundamentally in agriculture. Commerce and trade, which flourished in the previous [[Song dynasty|Song]] and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] dynasties, were less emphasized. Neo-feudal landholdings of the Song and Mongol periods were expropriated by the Ming rulers. Land estates were confiscated by the government, fragmented, and rented out. Private slavery was forbidden. Consequently, after the death of the [[Yongle Emperor]], independent peasant landholders predominated in Chinese agriculture. These laws might have paved the way to removing the worst of the poverty during the previous regimes. Towards later era of the [[Ming dynasty]], with declining government control, commerce, trade and private industries revived.\n\nThe dynasty had a strong and complex central government that unified and controlled the empire. The emperor's role became more autocratic, although [[Hongwu Emperor]] necessarily continued to use what he called the \"[[Grand Secretariat]]\" to assist with the immense paperwork of the bureaucracy, including [[memorial to the throne|memorials]] (petitions and recommendations to the throne), imperial edicts in reply, reports of various kinds, and tax records. It was this same bureaucracy that later prevented the Ming government from being able to adapt to changes in society, and eventually led to its decline.\n\nThe Yongle Emperor strenuously tried to extend China's influence beyond its borders by demanding other rulers send ambassadors to China to present tribute. A large navy was built, including four-masted ships displacing 1,500&nbsp;tons. A standing army of 1 million troops was created. The Chinese armies [[Ming\u2013H\u1ed3 War|conquered]]  and [[Fourth Chinese domination of Vietnam|occupied Vietnam]] for around 20 years, while the [[Treasure voyages|Chinese fleet sailed]] the China seas and the Indian Ocean, cruising as far as the east coast of Africa. The Chinese gained influence in eastern [[Moghulistan]]. Several maritime Asian nations sent envoys with tribute for the Chinese emperor. Domestically, the Grand Canal was expanded and became a stimulus to domestic trade. Over 100,000&nbsp;tons of iron per year were produced. Many books were printed using movable type. The imperial palace in Beijing's [[Forbidden City]] reached its current splendor. It was also during these centuries that the potential of south China came to be fully exploited. New crops were widely cultivated and industries such as those producing porcelain and textiles flourished.\n\nIn 1449 [[Esen Tayisi]] led an [[Oirats|Oirat]] Mongol invasion of northern China which culminated in the capture of the [[Zhengtong Emperor]] at [[Battle of Tumu Fortress|Tumu]]. Since then, the Ming became on the defensive on the northern frontier, which led to the [[Ming Great Wall]] being built. Most of what remains of the Great Wall of China today was either built or repaired by the Ming. The brick and granite work was enlarged, the watchtowers were redesigned, and cannons were placed along its length.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | total_width = 320\n | image_style = border:none;\n | image1 = Lin Liang-Eagles.jpg\n | alt1 = A donkey\n | caption1 = ''Eagles'' by [[Lin Liang]].

Located at the [[Guangdong Provincial Museum]].\n}}\n\nAt sea, the Ming became increasingly isolationist after the death of the Yongle Emperor. The treasure voyages which sailed Indian Ocean were discontinued, and the [[Haijin|maritime prohibition]] laws were set in place banning the Chinese from sailing abroad. European traders who reached China in the midst of the [[Age of Discovery]] were repeatedly rebuked in their requests for trade, with the Portuguese being [[Battle of Tunmen|repulsed by the Ming navy]] at [[Tuen Mun]] in 1521 and again [[Second Battle of Tamao|in 1522]]. Domestic and foreign demands for overseas trade, deemed illegal by the state, led to widespread ''[[wokou]]'' piracy attacking the southeastern coastline during the rule of the [[Jiajing Emperor]] (1507\u20131567), which only subsided after the opening of ports in [[Guangdong]] and [[Fujian]] and [[Jiajing wokou raids|much military suppression]].<ref>\"China > History > The Ming dynasty > Political history > The dynastic succession\", ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online'', 2007</ref> The Portuguese were allowed to settle in [[Macau]] in 1557 for trade, which remained in Portuguese hands until 1999. The Dutch entry into the Chinese seas was also met with fierce resistance, with the Dutch being chased off the [[Penghu|Penghu islands]] in the [[Sino-Dutch conflicts]] of 1622\u20131624 and were forced to settle in Taiwan instead. [[Dutch Formosa|The Dutch in Taiwan]] fought with the Ming in the [[Battle of Liaoluo Bay]] in 1633 and lost, and eventually surrendered to the Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]] in 1662, after the fall of the Ming dynasty.\n\nIn 1556, during the rule of the [[Jiajing Emperor]], the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake|Shaanxi earthquake]] killed about 830,000 people, the deadliest earthquake of all time.\n\nThe [[Ming dynasty]] intervened deeply in the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u201398)]], which ended with the withdrawal of all invading Japanese forces in [[Korea]], and the restoration of the [[Joseon dynasty]], its traditional ally and [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary state]]. The [[Imperial Chinese tributary system|regional hegemony]] of the Ming dynasty was preserved at a toll on its resources. Coincidentally, with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]'s control in [[Manchuria]] in decline, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] ([[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]) tribes, under their chieftain [[Nurhaci]], broke away from Ming\u2019s rule, and emerged as a powerful, unified state, which was [[Hong Taiji|later proclaimed]] as the [[Qing dynasty]]. It went on to subdue the much weakened [[Joseon dynasty|Korea]] as its [[List of tributaries of Imperial China|tributary]], conquered [[Northern Yuan dynasty|Mongolia]], and expanded its territory to the outskirt of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]]. The most elite army of the [[Ming dynasty]] was to station at the [[Shanhai Pass]] to guard the last stronghold against the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], which weakened its suppression of internal [[Li Zicheng|peasants uprisings]].\n\n=== Qing dynasty (AD 1644\u20131911) ===\n{{main|Qing dynasty}}\n{{see also|Century of humiliation}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| perrow = 2/2/2\n| total_width = 300\n| caption_align = center\n| title = Qing dynasty (AD 1644\u20131911)\n| image1 = Carte generale de l'Empire Chinois et du Japon (1836).jpg\n| caption1 = 1836 map of China published by C.

Founded by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], it was the second [[conquest dynasty]] to rule  the entire territory of China and its people. The Manchus were formerly known as [[Jurchen people|Jurchens]], residing in the northeastern part of the Ming territory outside the Great Wall. They emerged as the major threat to the late Ming dynasty after [[Nurhaci]] united all Jurchen tribes and established an independent state. However, the [[Ming dynasty]] would be overthrown by [[Li Zicheng]]'s peasants rebellion, with Beijing captured in 1644 and the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], the last Ming emperor, committing suicide. The Manchus allied with the former Ming general [[Wu Sangui]] to seize Beijing, which was made the capital of the Qing dynasty, and then proceeded to subdue the [[Southern Ming dynasty|Ming remnants in the south]]. The decades of Manchu conquest caused [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars and armed conflicts|enormous loss of lives]] and the [[Economic history of China before 1912#Qing dynasty (1644\u20131912)|economic scale of China shrank drastically]]. In total, the [[Qing conquest of the Ming]] (1618\u20131683) cost as many as 25 million lives.<ref>John M. Roberts (1997). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3QZXvUhGwhAC A Short History of the World]''. Oxford University Press. p. 272. {{ISBN|0-19-511504-X}}.</ref> Nevertheless, the Manchus adopted the Confucian norms of traditional Chinese government in their rule and were considered a Chinese dynasty.\n\nThe Manchus enforced a 'queue order,' forcing the Han Chinese to adopt the Manchu [[Queue (hairstyle)|queue hairstyle]]. Officials were required to wear Manchu-style clothing ''[[Changshan]]'' ([[Eight Banners|bannermen]] dress and ''[[Tangzhuang]]''), but ordinary Han civilians were allowed to wear traditional Han clothing, or ''[[Hanfu]]''. Most Han then voluntarily shifted to wearing Qipao anyway. The [[Kangxi Emperor]] ordered the creation of the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'', the most complete dictionary of [[Chinese characters]] that had been compiled. The Qing dynasty set up the [[Eight Banners]] system that provided the basic framework for the Qing military organization. Bannermen could not undertake trade or manual labor; they had to petition to be removed from banner status. They were considered a form of nobility and were given preferential treatment in terms of annual pensions, land, and allotments of cloth.\n\nOver the next half-century, all areas previously under the [[Ming dynasty]] were consolidated under the Qing. [[Xinjiang]], Tibet, and [[Mongolia]] were also formally incorporated into Chinese territory. Between 1673 and 1681, the Kangxi Emperor suppressed the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], an uprising of three generals in Southern China who had been denied hereditary rule of large fiefdoms granted by the [[Shunzhi Emperor|previous emperor]]. In 1683, the Qing staged an amphibious assault on southern [[Taiwan]], bringing down the rebel [[Kingdom of Tungning]], which was founded by the Ming loyalist [[Koxinga]] (Zheng Chenggong) in 1662 after the fall of the Southern Ming, and had served as a base for continued Ming resistance in Southern China. The Qing [[Sino-Russian border conflicts|defeated the Russians at Albazin]], resulting in the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]].\n\n[[File:Portrait of the Qianlong Emperor in Court Dress.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Qianlong Emperor]]]]\n\nBy the end of [[Qianlong Emperor]]'s long reign, the Qing Empire was at its zenith.

The defeat by the [[British Empire]] in the [[First Opium War]] (1840) led to the [[Treaty of Nanking]] (1842), under which [[History of Hong Kong (1800s\u20131930s)|Hong Kong]] was ceded to Britain and importation of [[opium]] (produced by British Empire territories) was allowed. Subsequent military defeats and [[unequal treaties]] with other western powers continued even after the fall of the Qing dynasty.\n\nInternally the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1851\u20131864), a quasi-Christian religious movement led by the \"Heavenly King\" [[Hong Xiuquan]], raided roughly a third of Chinese territory for over a decade until they were finally crushed in the [[Third Battle of Nanking]] in 1864. This was one of the largest wars in the 19th century in terms of troop involvement; there was massive loss of life, with [[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll#Wars and armed conflicts|a death toll of about 20 million]].<ref>{{cite web | first=Matthew | last=White |url = http://necrometrics.com/wars19c.htm | title = Statistics of Wars, Oppressions and Atrocities of the Nineteenth Century |accessdate=11 April 2007}}</ref> A string of civil disturbances followed, including the [[Punti\u2013Hakka Clan Wars]], [[Nian Rebellion]], [[Dungan revolt (1862\u20131877)|Dungan Revolt]], and [[Panthay Rebellion]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Damsan |last=Harper | first2=Steve |last2=Fallon |first3=Katja |last3=Gaskell |first4=Julie |last4=Grundvig |first5= Carolyn |last5=Heller | first6=Thomas |last6=Huhti |first7=Bradley |last7=Maynew |first8=Christopher | last8=Pitts | title=Lonely Planet China | edition=9 | year=2005 | ISBN=1-74059-687-0}}</ref> All rebellions were ultimately put down, but at enormous cost and with millions dead, seriously weakening the central imperial authority. The [[Eight Banners|Banner system]] that the Manchus had relied upon for so long failed: Banner forces were unable to suppress the rebels, and the government called upon local officials in the provinces, who raised \"New Armies\", which successfully crushed the challenges to Qing authority. China never rebuilt a strong central army, and many local officials became warlords who used military power to effectively rule independently in their provinces.<ref>Philip Kuhn, ''Rebellion and its Enemies in Late Imperial China: Militarization and Social Structure, 1796\u20131864'' (1970) ch 6</ref>\n\nIn response to calamities within the empire and threats from imperialism, the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]] was an institutional reform in the second half of the 1800s. The aim was to modernize the empire, with prime emphasis on strengthening the military. However, the reform was undermined by corrupt officials, cynicism, and quarrels within the imperial family. As a result, the \"[[Beiyang Fleet]]\" were soundly defeated in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] (1894\u20131895). The [[Guangxu Emperor]] and the reformists then launched a more comprehensive reform effort, the [[Hundred Days' Reform]] (1898), but it was soon overturned by the conservatives under [[Empress Dowager Cixi]] in a military coup.\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, the violent [[Boxer Rebellion]] opposed foreign influence in Northern China, and attacked Chinese Christians and missionaries. When Boxers entered Beijing, the Qing government ordered all foreigners to leave. But instead the foreigners and many Chinese were [[Siege of the International Legations|besieged in the foreign legations quarter]]. The [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] sent the [[Seymour Expedition]] of Japanese, Russian, Italian, German, French, American, and Austrian troops to relieve the siege. The Expedition was stopped by the Boxers at the [[Battle of Langfang]] and forced to retreat. Due to [[Battle of Dagu Forts (1900)|the Alliance's attack on the Dagu Forts]], the Qing government in response sided with the Boxers and declared war on the Alliance. There was [[Battle of Tientsin|fierce fighting at Tientsin]]. The Alliance formed the second, much larger [[Gaselee Expedition]] and [[Battle of Peking (1900)|finally reached Beijing]]; the Qing government evacuated to [[Xi'an]]. The [[Boxer Protocol]] ended the war.\n\n== Modern China ==\n<!--[[Republican China]] redirects here-->\n\n===Republic of China (since 1912)===\n{{main|History of the Republic of China|Republic of China (1912\u20131949)}}\n{{see also|History of Taiwan}}\n[[File:Xinhai Revolution in Shanghai.jpg|thumb|[[Nanjing Road]] during [[Xinhai Revolution]], 1911.]]\nFrustrated by the Qing court's resistance to reform and by China's weakness, young officials, military officers, and students began to advocate the overthrow of the Qing dynasty and the creation of a republic. They were inspired by the revolutionary ideas of [[Sun Yat-sen]]. A revolutionary military uprising, the [[Wuchang Uprising]], began on 10 October 1911, in [[Wuhan]]. The [[Provisional Government of the Republic of China (1912)|provisional government of the Republic of China]] was formed in [[Nanjing]] on 12 March 1912. The [[Xinhai Revolution]] ended 2,000 years of dynastic rule in China.\n{{double image|left|Sunyatsen1.jpg|150|Yuan Shikai2.jpg|145|[[Sun Yat-sen]], the leader of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] and the first provisional president of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].|[[Yuan Shikai]], the first president of the Republic of China.}}\nAfter the success of the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, [[Sun Yat-sen]] was declared [[President of the Republic of China|President]], but Sun was forced to turn power over to [[Yuan Shikai]], who commanded the [[New Army]] and was Prime Minister under the Qing government, as part of the agreement to let the [[Puyi|last Qing monarch]] abdicate (a decision Sun would later regret). Over the next few years, Yuan proceeded to abolish the national and provincial assemblies, and declared himself emperor in late 1915. Yuan's imperial ambitions were fiercely opposed by his subordinates; faced with the prospect of rebellion, he abdicated in March 1916, and died in June of that year.\n\nYuan's death in 1916 left a power vacuum in China; the republican government was all but shattered. This ushered in the [[Warlord Era]], during which much of the country was ruled by shifting coalitions of competing provincial military leaders.\n\nIn 1919, the [[May Fourth Movement]] began as a response to the terms imposed on China by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] ending [[World War I]], but quickly became a nationwide protest movement about the domestic situation in China. The protests were a moral success as the cabinet fell and China refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles, which had awarded German holdings to Japan. The [[New Culture Movement]] stimulated by the May Fourth Movement waxed strong throughout the 1920s and 1930s. According to Ebrey:\n:\"Nationalism, patriotism, progress, science, democracy, and freedom were the goals; imperialism, feudalism, warlordism, autocracy, patriarchy, and blind adherence to tradition were the enemies. Intellectuals struggled with how to be strong and modern and yet Chinese, how to preserve China as a political entity in the world of competing nations.\"<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey, ''Cambridge Illustrated History of China'' (1996) p 271</ref>[[File:Flag of the Republic of China.svg|alt=Blue Sky White Sun Wholly Red Earth|thumb|The flag of the Republic of China from 1928 to now.]]\n\nThe discrediting of liberal Western philosophy amongst leftist Chinese intellectuals led to more radical lines of thought inspired by the Russian Revolution, and supported by agents of the Comintern sent to China by Moscow. This created the seeds for the irreconcilable conflict between the left and right in China that would dominate Chinese history for the rest of the century.\n\nIn the 1920s, Sun Yat-sen established a revolutionary base in south China, and set out to unite the fragmented nation. With assistance from the [[Soviet Union]] (itself fresh from Lenin's takeover), he entered into an alliance with the fledgling [[Communist Party of China]]. After Sun's death from cancer in 1925, one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, [[Chiang Kai-shek]], seized control of the ''[[Kuomintang]]'' (Nationalist Party or KMT) and succeeded in bringing most of south and central China under its rule in a military campaign known as the [[Northern Expedition]] (1926\u20131927). Having defeated the warlords in south and central China by military force, Chiang was able to secure the nominal allegiance of the warlords in the North. In 1927, Chiang turned on the CPC and relentlessly chased the CPC armies and its leaders from their bases in southern and eastern China. In 1934, driven from their mountain bases such as the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]], the CPC forces embarked on the [[Long March]] across China's most desolate terrain to the northwest, where they established a guerrilla base at [[Yan'an]] in Shaanxi Province. During the Long March, the communists reorganized under a new leader, [[Mao Zedong]] (Mao Tse-tung).\n\nThe bitter struggle between the KMT and the CPC continued, openly or clandestinely, through the 14-year-long Japanese occupation of various parts of the country (1931\u20131945). The two Chinese parties nominally formed a united front to oppose the Japanese in 1937, during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937\u20131945), which became a part of [[World War II]]. Japanese forces committed numerous [[Japanese war crimes|war atrocities]] against the civilian population, including biological warfare (see [[Unit 731]]) and the [[Three Alls Policy]] (''Sank\u014d Sakusen''), the three alls being: ''\"Kill All, Burn All and Loot All\"''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fairbank |first1=J.

By 1949, the CPC had established control over most of the country ''(see [[Chinese Civil War]])''. Westad says the Communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Furthermore, his party was weakened in the war against the Japanese. Meanwhile, the Communists told different groups, such as peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and cloaked themselves in the cover of Chinese Nationalism.<ref>Odd Arne Westad, ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750'' (2012) p 291</ref> During the civil war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities, with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides.<ref>Rummel, Rudolph (1994), Death by Government.</ref> These included deaths from forced conscription and massacres.<ref>Valentino, Benjamin A.

Execution, deaths from forced labor and other atrocities resulted in millions of deaths under Mao. In 1966 Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which continued until Mao's death a decade later. The Cultural Revolution, motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the [[Soviet Union]], led to a major upheaval in Chinese society.\n\nIn 1972, at the peak of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met US president [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing to establish relations with the United States. In the same year, the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|PRC was admitted to the United Nations]] in place of the Republic of China, with permanent membership of the Security Council.\n\n[[File:Flag of the People's Republic of China.svg|alt=Blue Sky White Sun Wholly Red Earth|thumb|left|The flag of the People's Republic of China since 1949.]]\nA power struggle followed Mao's death in 1976. The [[Gang of Four]] were arrested and blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, marking the end of a turbulent political era in China. [[Deng Xiaoping]] outmaneuvered Mao's anointed successor chairman [[Hua Guofeng]], and gradually emerged as the ''de facto'' leader over the next few years.\n\nDeng Xiaoping was the [[Paramount Leader]] of China from 1978 to 1992, although he never became the head of the party or state, and his influence within the Party led the country to [[Chinese economic reform|significant economic reforms]]. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the [[People's commune|communes]] were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. In addition, there were many free market areas opened. The most successful free market areas was shenzhen. It is located in guangdong and the property tax free area still exists today.

[[Brahmagupta]], an Indian mathematician, used arithmetic in the 7th century AD, based on Hindu-Arabic numerals, for excavation (volume) computations.<ref>Henry Thomas Colebrook, [https://books.google.com/books?id=A3cAAAAAMAAJ ''Algebra: with Arithmetic and mensuration''] (London 1817)</ref>\n\n==Civil engineer==\n\n===Education and licensure===\n{{Main|Civil engineer}}\n[[File:Tkkstudentsbackinthedays.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Surveying students with professor at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]] in the late 19th century.]]\n\n''Civil engineers'' typically possess an [[academic degree]] in civil engineering. The length of study is three to five years, and the completed degree is designated as a [[bachelor of technology]], or a [[bachelor of engineering]]. The curriculum generally includes classes in physics, mathematics, [[project management]], design and specific topics in civil engineering. After taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering, they move onto specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels. While an undergraduate degree (BEng/BSc) normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification, some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees (MEng/MSc), which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest.<ref name=\"CITE Postgrad\">,{{cite web| url= http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081106121950/http://www.uel.ac.uk/cite/programmes/postgraduate/index.htm| dead-url= yes| archive-date= 2008-11-06| title= Cite Postgrad}}</ref>\n\nIn most countries, a bachelor's degree in engineering represents the first step towards [[professional certification]], and a [[professional body]] certifies the degree program. After completing a certified degree program, the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements (including work experience and exam requirements) before being certified. Once certified, the engineer is designated as a [[professional engineer]] (in the United States, Canada and South Africa), a [[chartered engineer]] (in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries), a chartered professional engineer (in Australia and [[New Zealand]]), or a European engineer (in most countries of the [[European Union]]). There are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders.\n\nThe benefits of certification vary depending upon location. For example, in the United States and Canada, \"only a licensed [[professional engineer]] may prepare, sign and seal, and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval, or seal engineering work for public and private clients.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Why Should You Get Licensed? | work = National Society of Professional Engineers | url = http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | accessdate = 11 August 2007 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050604085233/http://www.nspe.org/lc1-why.asp | archivedate = 4 June 2005 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> This requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the Engineers Act in [[Quebec]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Engineers Act | work = Quebec Statutes and Regulations (CanLII) | url = http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061005184956/http://www.canlii.org/qc/laws/sta/i-9/20050616/whole.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 5 October 2006 | accessdate = 11 August 2007 }}</ref>\n\nNo such legislation has been enacted in other countries including the United Kingdom.

General civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading, drainage, [[Pavement (material)|pavement]], water supply, sewer service, dams, electric and communications supply. General civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering, a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another. Site engineers spend time visiting project sites, meeting with stakeholders, and preparing construction plans. Civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, environmental engineering, transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential, commercial, industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction.\n\n===Coastal engineering===\n{{Main|Coastal engineering|Coastal management}}\n[[File:Oosterscheldekering, Netherlands.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Oosterscheldekering]], a [[storm surge barrier]] in the Netherlands.]]\n''Coastal engineering'' is concerned with managing coastal areas. In some jurisdictions, the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion, respectively. The term coastal defense is the more traditional term, but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land.\n\n===Construction engineering===\n{{Main|Construction engineering}}\n''Construction engineering'' involves planning and execution, transportation of materials, site development based on hydraulic, environmental, structural and geotechnical engineering. As construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms do, construction engineers often engage in more business-like transactions, for example, drafting and reviewing contracts, evaluating [[Logistics|logistical operations]], and monitoring prices of supplies.\n\n===Earthquake engineering===\n{{Main|Earthquake engineering}}\n''Earthquake engineering'' involves designing structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures. Earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering. The main objectives of earthquake engineering are<ref>Chen W-F, Scawthorn C. Earthquake Engineering Handbook, CRC Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-8493-0068-1}}, Chapter 2</ref> to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground; foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes; and design, construct and maintain structures to [[seismic performance|perform]] at earthquake in compliance with [[building code]]s.\n\n===Environmental engineering===\n{{Main|Environmental engineering}}\n[[File:Water pollution.jpg|right|thumbnail|left|upright=1.15|Water pollution]]\n''Environmental engineering'' is the contemporary term for [[sanitary engineering]], though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering. Public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used.\n\nEnvironmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical, biological, or thermal wastes, purification of water and air, and [[Environmental remediation|remediation]] of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination. Among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport, [[water purification]], [[waste water treatment]], air pollution, [[Waste management|solid waste treatment]], and [[hazardous waste|hazardous waste management]]. Environmental engineers administer pollution reduction, green engineering, and [[industrial ecology]]. Environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions.\n\n===Forensic engineering===\n{{Main|Forensic engineering}}\n''Forensic engineering'' is the investigation of materials, [[Product (business)|products]], structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property. The consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability. The field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery. The subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases, although it may be of use in criminal law cases. Generally the purpose of a Forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component, or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident. It can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims, especially [[patent]]s.\n\n===Geotechnical engineering===\n{{Main|Geotechnical engineering}}\n[[File:Soil-phase-diagram.svg|thumb|A phase diagram of soil indicating the weights and volumes of air, soil, water, and voids.]]\n''Geotechnical engineering'' studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems. Knowledge from the field of [[soil science]], materials science, [[mechanics]], and [[hydraulics]] is applied to safely and economically design [[foundation (engineering)|foundations]], [[retaining wall]]s, and other structures. Environmental efforts to protect [[groundwater]] and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering.<ref name=\"mitchell\">Mitchell, James Kenneth (1993), Fundamentals of Soil Behavior (2nd ed.), John Wiley and Sons, pp 1\u20132</ref><ref>Shroff, Arvind V.; Shah, Dhananjay L. (2003), Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering, Taylor & Francis, 2003, pp 1\u20132</ref>\n\nIdentification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical engineers. [[Boundary condition]]s are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering, but unlike steel or concrete, the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on [[geotechnical investigation|investigation]]. Furthermore, soil exhibits nonlinear ([[stress (physics)|stress]]-dependent) [[shear strength (soil)|strength]], stiffness, and dilatancy (volume change associated with application of shear stress), making studying [[soil mechanics]] all the more difficult.<ref name=\"mitchell\"/> Geotechnical engineers frequently work with professional [[geologists]] and [[soil scientists]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Geotechnical/Geological Engineering |url=https://www.ausimm.com.au/content/docs/careers_booklet_geotgeoleng.pdf |website=Professional Careers in the Mineral Industry |publisher=The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy |accessdate=30 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Materials science and engineering===\n{{Main|Materials science}}\n''Materials science'' is closely related to civil engineering. It studies fundamental characteristics of materials, and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete, strong metals such as aluminum and steel, and [[thermosetting polymer]]s including [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and carbon fibers.\n\n''Materials engineering'' involves protection and prevention (paints and finishes). Alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties. It incorporates elements of [[applied physics]] and [[chemistry]]. With recent media attention on [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]], materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research. It is also an important part of forensic engineering and [[failure analysis]].\n\n===Structural engineering===\n{{Main|Structural engineering}}\n[[File:Burj Dubai Evolution.ogv|right|thumb|[[Burj Khalifa]] animation of construction process|thumbtime=0:23]]\n[[File:Construcci\u00f3n de una cimentaci\u00f3n por zapata aislada.ogv|thumb|left|[[Shallow foundation]] construction example]]\n''Structural engineering'' is concerned with the [[structural design]] and [[structural analysis]] of buildings, bridges, [[tower]]s, [[overpass|flyovers]] (overpasses), tunnels, off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea, [[aerostructure]] and other structures. This involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads, and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads. The loads can be self weight of the structures, other dead load, live loads, moving (wheel) load, wind load, earthquake load, load from temperature change etc. The structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for (to be ''serviceable''). Due to the nature of some loading conditions, sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged, including [[wind engineering]] and earthquake engineering.<ref>Narayanan, R, A Beeby. ''Introduction to Design for Civil Engineers''. London: Spon, 2003.</ref>\n\nDesign considerations will include strength, stiffness, and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static, such as furniture or self-weight, or dynamic, such as wind, seismic, crowd or vehicle loads, or transitory, such as temporary construction loads or impact. Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and [[sustainability]].\n\n===Surveying===\n{{Main|Surveying|Construction surveying}}\n[[File:Student using a dumpy level.jpg|thumb|A student using a [[dumpy level]]]]\n''Surveying'' is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the Earth. Surveying equipment, such as levels and theodolites, are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation, horizontal, vertical and slope distances. With computerisation, electronic distance measurement (EDM), total stations, GPS surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments. Data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the Earth's surface in the form of a map. This information is then used by civil engineers, contractors and realtors to design from, build on, and trade, respectively. Elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures. Although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements, civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping, as well as [[geographic information system]]s. Surveyors also lay out the routes of railways, [[tramway track]]s, highways, roads, pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure, such as [[harbor]]s, before construction.\n\n;Land surveying\n[[File:Bureau of Land Management Cadastral Survey Marker Arizona.jpg|upright=0.9|thumb|[[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[cadastral]] survey marker from 1992 in [[San Xavier, Arizona]].]]\nIn the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and most Commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct profession. [[Surveying#Land surveyor|Land surveyors]] are not considered to be engineers, and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements. The services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys (to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description) and subdivision plans (a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land, with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads), both of which are generally referred to as [[Cadastral surveying]].\n\n;Construction surveying\nConstruction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians. Unlike land surveyors, the resulting plan does not have legal status. Construction surveyors perform the following tasks:\n* Surveying existing conditions of the future work site, including topography, existing buildings and infrastructure, and underground infrastructure when possible;\n* \"lay-out\" or \"setting-out\": placing reference points and markers that will guide the construction of new structures such as roads or buildings;\n* Verifying the location of structures during construction;\n* As-Built surveying: a survey conducted at the end of the construction project to verify that the work authorized was completed to the specifications set on plans.\n\n===Transportation engineering===\n{{Main|Transportation engineering}}\n[[File:Old Market Roundabout, Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The engineering of this [[roundabout]] in [[Bristol]], England, attempts to make traffic flow free-moving]]\n''Transportation engineering'' is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently, safely, and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets, canals, highways, [[rail transport|rail systems]], airports, ports, and [[mass transit]]. It includes areas such as transportation design, [[transportation planning]], [[traffic engineering (transportation)|traffic engineering]], some aspects of [[municipal or urban engineering|urban engineering]], [[queueing theory]], [[pavement engineering]], [[Intelligent Transportation System]] (ITS), and infrastructure management.\n\n===Municipal or urban engineering===\n{{Main|Urban engineering}}\n[[File:LagoMenorChapultepec3.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.15|Lake [[Chapultepec]]]]\n''Municipal engineering'' is concerned with municipal infrastructure. This involves specifying, designing, constructing, and maintaining streets, [[sidewalk]]s, [[municipal water supply|water supply networks]], sewers, [[street light]]ing, [[municipal solid waste]] management and disposal, storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works (salt, sand, etc.), [[urban park|public parks]] and [[cycling infrastructure]]. In the case of underground [[public utility|utility]] networks, it may also include the civil portion (conduits and access chambers) of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services. It can also include the optimizing of waste collection and [[public transport bus service|bus service]] networks. Some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties, however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services, as they are often built simultaneously, and managed by the same municipal authority.  Municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings, industrial plants or campuses (i.e. access roads, parking lots, potable water supply, treatment or pretreatment of waste water, site drainage, etc.)\n\n===Water resources engineering===\n{{See also|Hydraulic engineering|Hydrology}}\n[[File:Hoover dam from air.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hoover Dam]] ]]\n''Water resources engineering'' is concerned with the collection and management of water (as a [[natural resource]]). As a discipline it therefore combines elements of hydrology, environmental science, [[meteorology]], [[water conservation|conservation]], and [[resource management]]. This area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground ([[aquifer]]s) and above ground (lakes, rivers, and streams) resources. Water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into, through, or out of a facility. Although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers.\n\n''Hydraulic engineering'' is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids, principally water. This area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], [[water supply network]], drainage facilities (including bridges, dams, [[Channel (geography)|channels]], [[culvert]]s, [[levee]]s, [[storm sewer]]s), and canals. Hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of [[fluid pressure]], [[fluid statics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and hydraulics, among others.\n===Civil Engineering Systems===\nCivil engineering systems is a discipline that promotes the use of systems thinking to manage complexity and change in civil engineering within its wider public context. It posits that the proper development of civil engineering [[infrastructure]] requires a [[Holism|holistic]], coherent understanding of the relationships between all of the important factors that contribute to successful projects while at the same time emphasising the importance of attention to technical detail. Its purpose is to help integrate the entire civil engineering [[Project management|project life cycle]] from conception, through planning, designing, making, operating to decommissioning.<ref> [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Introduction+to+Civil+Engineering+Systems%3A+A+Systems+Perspective+to+the+Development+of+Civil+Engineering+Facilities-p-9780470530634 Samuel Labi ''Introduction to Civil Engineering Systems: A Systems Perspective to the Development of Civil Engineering Facilities''] 2014, John Wiley{{ISBN|978-0-470-53063-4}} Retrieved May 2018 </ref> <ref>[http://www.icebookshop.com/bookshop_main.asp?ISBN=9780727760821 David Blockley and Patrick Godfrey ''Doing it Differently: Systems for Rethinking Infrastructure (2nd Edition)''] ICE Publications, London {{ISBN|978-0727760821}}\" Retrieved May 2018 </ref>\n\n==Civil engineering associations==\n[[File:FalkirkWheelSide 2004 SeanMcClean.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Falkirk Wheel]] in Scotland]]\n* [[American Society of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Canadian Society for Civil Engineering]]\n* [[Chartered Institution of Civil Engineering Surveyors]]\n* [[Earthquake Engineering Research Institute]]\n* [[Engineers Australia]]\n* [[European Federation of National Engineering Associations ]]\n* [[FIDIC|International Federation of Consulting Engineers]]\n* [[Indian Geotechnical Society]]\n* [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Institution of Structural Engineers]]\n* [[Institute of Engineering]] (Nepal)\n* [[International Society of Soil Mechanics and Geotechnical Engineering]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers, Bangladesh]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers (India)]]\n* [[Institution of Engineers of Ireland]]\n* [[Institute of Transportation Engineers]]\n* [[Pakistan Engineering Council]]\n* [[Philippine Institute of Civil Engineers]]\n* [[Transportation Research Board]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal| Civil Engineering | Engineering }}\n* [[Architectural engineering]]\n* [[Civil engineering software]]\n* [[Engineering drawing]]\n* [[Glossary of civil engineering]]\n* [[Index of civil engineering articles]]\n* [[List of civil engineers]]\n* [[List of engineering branches]]\n* [[List of Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks]]\n* [[Macro-engineering]]\n* [[Railway engineering]]\n* [[Site survey]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|title=The Civil Engineering Handbook|isbn=978-0-8493-0958-8|publisher=CRC Press|editors=W .

No footpaths or streets were used between the dwellings, which were clustered in a honeycomb-like maze. Most were accessed by holes in the ceiling and doors on the side of the houses, with doors reached by ladders and stairs. The rooftops were effectively streets. The ceiling openings also served as the only source of ventilation, allowing smoke from the houses' open hearths and ovens to escape. \n<!--{{Neolithic}}-->\nHouses had [[plaster]] interiors characterized by squared-off timber ladders or steep stairs. These were usually on the south wall of the room, as were [[cooking hearth]]s and [[oven]]s. The main rooms contained raised platforms that may have been used for a range of domestic activities. Typical houses contained two rooms for everyday activity, such as cooking and crafting.<ref name=Maynes/> All interior walls and platforms were plastered to a smooth finish.<ref name=gard/> Ancillary rooms were used as storage, and were accessed through low openings from main rooms.\n\nAll rooms were kept scrupulously clean. Archaeologists identified very little rubbish in the buildings, finding middens outside the ruins, with sewage and food waste, as well as significant amounts of wood ash. In good weather, many daily activities may also have taken place on the rooftops, which may have formed a plaza. In later periods, large communal ovens appear to have been built on these rooftops. Over time, houses were renewed by partial demolition and rebuilding on a foundation of rubble, which was how the mound was gradually built up. As many as eighteen levels of settlement have been uncovered.\n\nAs a part of ritual life, the people of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck buried their dead within the village.<ref name=Maynes/> Human remains have been found in pits beneath the floors and, especially, beneath hearths, the platforms within the main rooms, and under beds. Bodies were tightly flexed before burial and were often placed in [[baskets]] or wound and wrapped in reed mats. Disarticulated bones in some graves suggest that bodies may have been exposed in the open air for a time before the bones were gathered and buried. In some cases, graves were disturbed, and the individual\u2019s head removed from the skeleton. These heads may have been used in rituals, as some were found in other areas of the community. In a woman's grave spinning whorls were recovered and in a man's grave, stone axes.<ref name=Maynes/> Some [[Plastered human skulls|skulls were plastered]] and painted with [[ochre]] to recreate faces, a custom more characteristic of Neolithic sites in Syria and at Neolithic [[Jericho]] than at sites closer by.\n\nVivid [[murals]] and [[figurine]]s are found throughout the settlement, on interior and exterior walls.

Although a male deity existed as well, \"statues of a female [[deity]] far outnumber those of the male deity, who moreover, does not appear to be represented at all after Level&nbsp;VI\".<ref name=mellart181>{{cite book | first = James | last = Mellaart |year = 1967 | title = Catal Huyuk: A Neolithic Town in Anatolia | publisher = [[McGraw-Hill]] | pages = 181}}</ref> To date, eighteen levels have been identified. These artfully-hewn figurines were found primarily in areas Mellaart believed to be shrines. The stately goddess seated on a [[throne]] flanked by two lionesses (''illustration'') was found in a grain bin, which Mellaart suggests might have been a means of ensuring the harvest or protecting the food supply.<ref name=mellart180>Mellaart (1967), 180.</ref> In later cultures, similar depictions are seen of [[Cybele]], a mountain goddess.\n\nWhereas Mellaart excavated nearly two hundred buildings in four seasons, the current excavator, Ian Hodder, spent an entire season excavating one building alone.<ref name=balter127>{{cite book | first = Michael | last = Balter | title = The Goddess and the Bull | year = 2005 | publisher = Free Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-7432-4360-9 | pages = 127}}</ref>  Hodder and his team, in 2004 and 2005, began to believe that the patterns suggested by Mellaart were false.  They found one similar figurine, but the vast majority did not imitate the [[Mother Goddess]] style that Mellaart suggested. Instead of a Mother Goddess culture, Hodder points out that the site gives little indication of a matriarchy or patriarchy.\n\n{{quote|There are full breasts on which the hands rest, and the stomach is extended in the central part. There is a hole in the top for the head which is missing. As one turns the figurine around one notices that the arms are very thin, and then on the back of the figurine one sees a depiction of either a skeleton or the bones of a very thin and depleted human. The ribs and vertebrae are clear, as are the scapulae and the main pelvic bones. The figurine can be interpreted in a number of ways - as a woman turning into an ancestor, as a woman associated with death, or as death and life conjoined. It is possible that the lines around the body represent wrapping rather than ribs. Whatever the specific interpretation, this is a unique piece that may force us to change our views of the nature of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck society and imagery. Perhaps the importance of female imagery was related to some special role of the female in relation to death as much as to the roles of mother and nurturer.<ref name=hodder>{{cite web | last = Hodder | first = Ian | title = New finds and new interpretations at \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck | work = \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck 2005 Archive Report | publisher = Catalhoyuk Research Project, Institute of Archaeology | year = 2005 | url = http://www.catalhoyuk.com/archive_reports/2005/ar05_01.html}}</ref>}}\n\nIn an article in the ''Turkish Daily News'', Hodder is reported as denying that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was a matriarchal society and quoted as saying \"When we look at what they eat and drink and at their social statues, we see that men and women had the same social status.

Sir James Mellaart who excavated the site in the 1960s came up with all sorts of ideas about the way the site was organized and how it was lived in and so on ... We\u2019ve now started working there since the mid 1990s and come up with very different ideas about the site. One of the most obvious examples of that is that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck is perhaps best known for the idea of the mother [[goddess]]. But our work more recently has tended to show that in fact there is very little evidence of a mother goddess and very little evidence of some sort of female-based matriarchy. That\u2019s just one of the many myths that the modern scientific work is undermining.<ref name=\"O'Brien\">O'Brien, Jeremy \"New techniques undermine 'mother goddess' role in the community\" ''Irish Times'' September 20, 2009 [http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0910/1224254196976.html]</ref></blockquote>\n\nProfessor Lynn Meskell explained that while the original excavations had found only 200 figures, the new excavations had uncovered 2,000 figurines of which most were animals, with less than 5% of the figurines women.<ref name=\"O'Brien\" />\n\nEstonian folklorist [[Uku Masing]] has suggested as early as in 1976, that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was probably a hunting and gathering religion and the Mother Goddess figurine did not represent a female deity. He implied that perhaps a longer period of time was needed in order to develop symbols for agricultural rites.<ref name=Masing>{{cite book | first = Uku | last = Masing | year = 2011 | title = Aarded Tellistes | publisher = Ilmamaa | location = Tartu, Estonia | isbn = 978-9985-77-351-2 | pages = 209\u2013227}}</ref> His theory was developed in the paper \"Some remarks on the mythology of the people of Catal H\u00fcy\u00fck\".<ref>Oriental Studies 3.

The most recent investigations also reveal little [[social stratification|social distinction]] based on gender, with men and women receiving equivalent nutrition and seeming to have equal social status, as typically found in [[Paleolithic]] cultures.<ref name=\"Stavrianos\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MKhe6qNva10C&q=paleolithic+society&dq=paleolithic+society|title=A Global History from Prehistory to the Present|author=Leften Stavros Stavrianos|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1991|isbn=0-13-357005-3|location=New Jersey, USA}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MKhe6qNva10C&q=paleolithic+society&dq=paleolithic+society&pgis=1 Pages 9\u201313]</ref><ref name=\"Gutrie\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&printsec=frontcover#PPA420,M1|title=The Nature of Paleolithic art|author=R Dale Gutrie|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2005|isbn=0-226-31126-0|location=Chicago}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&printsec=frontcover#PPA420,M1 Page 420-422]</ref> Children observed domestic areas. They learned how to perform rituals and how to build or repair houses by watching the adults make statues, beads and other objects.<ref name=\"Maynes\" />\n\u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck's spatial layout may be due to the close kin relations exhibited amongst the people. It can be seen, in the layout, that the people were \"divided into two groups who lived on opposite sides of the town, separated by a gully.\" Furthermore, because no nearby towns were found from which marriage partners could be drawn, \"this spatial separation must have marked two intermarrying kinship groups.\" This would help explain how a settlement so early on would become so large.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Family: A World History|last1=Maynes|first1=Mary Jo|last2=Waltner|first2=Ann|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-530476-3|location=New York, New York|page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn upper levels of the site, it becomes apparent that the people of \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck were gaining skills in [[agriculture]] and the domestication of animals. Female figurines have been found within bins used for storage of [[cereal]]s, such as [[wheat]] and [[barley]], and the figurines are presumed to be of a deity protecting the grain. [[Peas]] were also grown, and [[almonds]], [[pistachio]]s, and fruit were harvested from trees in the surrounding hills. [[domestic sheep|Sheep]] were domesticated and evidence suggests the beginning of [[cattle]] [[domestication]] as well.  However, [[hunting]] continued to be a major source of food for the community.  [[Pottery]] and [[obsidian]] [[tools]] appear to have been major industries; [[obsidian]] tools were probably both used and also traded for items such as [[Mediterranean]] [[sea]] [[animal shell|shells]] and [[flint]] from [[Syria]]. There is also evidence that the settlement was the first place in the world to mine and smelt metal in the form of [[lead]]. Noting the lack of hierarchy and economic inequality, historian [[Murray Bookchin]] has argued that \u00c7atalh\u00f6y\u00fck was an early example of [[anarcho-communism]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Rise of Urbanisation and Decline of Citizenship|last=Bookchin|first=Murray|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=18 - 22}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Cities of the ancient Near East]]\n*[[Cucuteni\u2013Trypillian culture]]\n*[[G\u00f6bekli Tepe]]\n*[[Kamyana Mohyla]]\n*[[List of largest cities throughout history]]\n*[[List of Stone Age art]]\n*[[Matriarchy]]\n*[[Neolithic Revolution]]\n*[[Old Europe (archaeology)]]\n*[[Sacred bull]]\n*[[Venus figurines]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bailey, Douglass.

the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from 1945 to 1951 and [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1935 to 1955. In 1940, Attlee took Labour into the [[Churchill war ministry|wartime coalition government]] and served under [[Winston Churchill]], becoming, in 1942, the first person to hold the office of [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He went on to lead the Labour Party to an unexpected landslide victory at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]]; forming the first Labour majority government, and a mandate to implement its postwar reforms. The 12 per cent national swing from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] to Labour was unprecedented at that time and remains the largest ever achieved by any party at a general election in British electoral history. He was re-elected with a narrow majority at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]]. In the following year, Attlee called a [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|snap general election]], hoping to increase his parliamentary majority. However, he was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives under the leadership of Winston Churchill, despite winning the most votes of any political party in any general election in British political history until the Conservative Party's fourth consecutive victory in [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]]. Attlee remains the longest-ever serving Leader of the Labour Party. \n\nFirst elected to the House of Commons in [[1922 UK general election|1922]] as the MP for [[Limehouse (UK Parliament constituency)|Limehouse]], Attlee rose quickly to become a junior minister in the first Labour minority government led by [[Ramsay MacDonald]] in 1924, and then joined the Cabinet during MacDonald's second ministry of 1929\u20131931. One of only a handful of Labour frontbenchers to retain his seat in the landslide defeat of [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931]], he became the party's [[Deputy Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Deputy Leader]]. After the resignation of [[George Lansbury]] in 1935, he was elected as Leader of the Labour Party and Leader of the Opposition in the subsequent [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1935|leadership election]]. At first advocating [[pacificism]] and opposing [[British re-armament|rearmament]], he later reversed his position; by 1938, he became a strong critic of [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s attempts to appease [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]]. He took Labour into the Churchill war ministry in 1940. Initially serving as [[Lord Privy Seal]], he was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister in 1942. Attlee and Churchill worked together very smoothly, with Attlee working backstage to handle much of the detail and organisational work in Parliament, as Churchill took centre stage with his attention on diplomacy, military policy, and broader issues. With victory in Europe in May 1945, the coalition government was dissolved. Attlee led Labour to win a huge majority in the ensuing [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]] two months later.\n      \nThe government he led built the [[post-war consensus]], based upon the assumption that [[full employment]] would be maintained by [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian policies]] and that a greatly enlarged system of social services would be created \u2013 aspirations that had been outlined in the 1942 [[Beveridge Report]]. Within this context, his government undertook the nationalisation of public utilities and major industries, as well as the creation of the [[National Health Service]]. Attlee himself had little interest in economic matters but this settlement was broadly accepted by all parties for three decades. Foreign policy was the special domain of [[Ernest Bevin]], but Attlee took special interest in India. He supervised the process by which [[Partition of India|India was partitioned into India and Pakistan in 1947]]. He also arranged the independence of Burma ([[Myanmar]]), and Ceylon ([[Sri Lanka]]). His government ended the British Mandates of [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] and [[British Mandate of Jordan|Jordan]]. From 1947 onwards, he and Bevin pushed the [[United States]] to take a more vigorous role in the emerging [[Cold War]] against [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Communism]]. When the budgetary crisis forced Britain out of Greece in 1947, he called on Washington to counter the Communists with the [[Truman Doctrine]].<ref>Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' (1983) ch 8</ref> He avidly supported the [[Marshall Plan]] to rebuild Western Europe with American money. In 1949, he promoted the [[NATO]] military alliance against the [[Eastern bloc|Soviet bloc]]. He sent British troops to fight in the [[Malayan Emergency]] in 1948 and sent the [[RAF]] to participate in the [[Berlin Airlift]]. He commissioned an independent nuclear deterrent for the UK. He used 13,000 troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the London dock strike in 1949. After leading [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] to a narrow victory at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950 general election]], he sent British troops to fight in the [[Korean War]]. Attlee was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives under Churchill in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]]. He continued as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] but had lost his effectiveness by then. He retired after losing the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 general election]] and was elevated to the [[House of Lords]].\n \nIn public, Attlee was modest and unassuming; he was ineffective at public relations and lacked charisma. His strengths emerged behind the scenes, especially in committees where his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity, and pragmatism proved decisive. His achievements in politics owed much to lucky breaks and the unsuitability of his rivals.{{sfn|Pearce|1997|p=2}} He saw himself as spokesman on behalf of his entire party and successfully kept its multiple factions in harness. Attlee is consistently rated by scholars, critics and the public as one of the [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|greatest British Prime Ministers]]. His reputation among scholars in recent decades has been much higher than during his years as Prime Minister, thanks to his roles in leading the Labour Party, creating the [[welfare state]] and building the coalition opposing [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] in the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nAttlee was born on 3 January 1883 in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]] (now part of London), into a [[middle-class]] family, the seventh of eight children. His father was Henry Attlee (1841\u20131908), a [[solicitor]], and his mother was Ellen Bravery Watson (1847\u20131920), daughter of Thomas Simons Watson, secretary for the [[Art Union of London]].<ref>Davies, Edward J. \"The Ancestry of Clement Attlee\", ''Genealogists' Magazine'', 31(2013\u201315): 380\u201387.</ref> He was educated at Northaw School, a boys' preparatory school near [[Pluckley]] in [[Kent]], [[Haileybury College]], and [[University College, Oxford]], where in 1904 he graduated as a [[Bachelor of Arts]] with [[British undergraduate degree classification|second-class honours]] in [[modern history]].\n\nAttlee then trained as a [[barrister]] at the [[Inner Temple]] and was [[call to the bar|called to the bar]] in March 1906. He worked for a time at his father's law firm Druces and Attlee but did not enjoy the work, and had no particular ambition to succeed in the legal profession.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||p=17}} He also played football for [[non-League football|non-League]] club [[Fleet Town F.C.|Fleet]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11566133/Why-football-can-be-a-dangerous-game-for-politicians.html Why football can be a dangerous game for politicians] Daily Telegraph, 27 April 2015</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1906, he became a volunteer at Haileybury House, a charitable club for [[working-class]] boys in [[Stepney]] in the [[East End of London]] run by his old school, and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the club's manager. Until then, his political views had been more [[conservative]]. However, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the [[slum]] children, he came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and [[income redistribution]] by the state would have any serious effect. This sparked a process that caused him to convert to [[socialism]]. He subsequently joined the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) in 1908 and became active in local politics. In 1909, he stood unsuccessfully at his first election, as an ILP candidate for Stepney Borough Council.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=18\u201335}}\n\nHe also worked briefly as a secretary for [[Beatrice Webb]] in 1909, before becoming a secretary for [[Toynbee Hall]]. In 1911, he was employed by the [[UK Government]] as an \"official explainer\"\u2014touring the country to explain [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[David Lloyd George]]'s [[National Insurance Act]]. He spent the summer of that year touring [[Essex]] and [[Somerset]] on a bicycle, explaining the act at public meetings. A year later, he became a [[lecturer]] at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=34\u201343}}\n\n==Military service during the First World War==\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in August 1914, Attlee applied to join the [[British Army]]. Initially his application was turned down, as at age 31 he was seen as too old; however, he was finally allowed to join in September, and was commissioned<ref>''London Gazette'' issue 28985, published 24 November 1914. Page 5</ref> in the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|Captain]] with the 6th (Service) Battalion, [[South Lancashire Regiment]], part of the [[38th Brigade (United Kingdom)|38th Brigade]] of the [[13th (Western) Division]], and was sent to fight in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] in [[Ottoman Empire|Turkey]]. His decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother Tom, who, as a [[conscientious objector]], spent much of the war in prison.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=43\u201345, 52}}\n\nAfter a period fighting in Gallipoli, he collapsed after falling ill with [[dysentery]] and was put on a ship bound for [[England]] to recover.  When he woke up he wanted to get back to action as soon as possible, and asked to be let off the ship in [[Malta]] where he stayed in hospital to recover. His hospitalisation coincided with the [[Battle of Sari Bair]], which saw a large number of his comrades killed. Upon returning to action, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the [[Gallipoli Campaign#Evacuation|evacuation of Suvla]]. As such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from [[Landing at Suvla Bay|Suvla Bay]], the last being General [[Stanley Maude]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=47\u201350}}\n[[File:Attlee, 1916 IWM (crop).png|thumb|left|Attlee (seen in the centre) in 1916, aged 33, whilst serving in Mesopotamia.]]\nThe Gallipoli Campaign had been engineered by the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Winston Churchill]]. Although it was unsuccessful, Attlee believed that it was a bold strategy, which could have been a success if it had been better implemented on the ground. This gave him an admiration for Churchill as a military strategist, which would make their working relationship in later years productive.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|p=46}}\n\nHe later served in the [[Mesopotamian Campaign]] in what is now [[Iraq]], where in April 1916 he was badly wounded, being hit in the leg by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] while storming an enemy trench during the Battle of Hanna. He was sent firstly to [[British India|India]], and then back to the UK to recover. In February 1917, he was promoted to the rank of [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]],<ref>''London Gazette Issue 30425'', published 11 December 1917<!-- page(s) needed --></ref> leading him to be known as \"Major Attlee\" for much of the [[Interwar period|inter-war period]]. He would spend most of 1917 training soldiers at various locations in England.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=50\u201351}} From 2 to 9 July 1917, he was the temporary commanding officer (CO) of the newly formed L (later 10th) Battalion, the [[Royal Tank Regiment|Tank Corps]] at Bovington Camp, [[Dorset]]. From 9 July, he assumed command of 30th Company of the same battalion however he did not deploy to France with it in December 1917.<ref>''The National Archive WO 95/101 War History of 10th Battalion, Tank Corps'', pp. 1\u20132.<!--publisher, year, ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nAfter fully recovering from his injuries, he was sent to France in June 1918 to serve on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] for the final months of the war. After being discharged from the Army in January 1919, he returned to [[Stepney]], and returned to his old job lecturing part-time at the [[London School of Economics]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=55\u201358}}\n\n==Marriage and children==\nAttlee met [[Violet Attlee|Violet Millar]] while on a long trip with friends to Italy in 1921. They bonded immediately<ref>Bew, John (2016) ''Citizen Clem'', Riverrun, p. 115</ref> and were soon engaged, marrying at [[Christ Church, Hampstead]], on 10 January 1922. It would come to be a devoted marriage, with Attlee providing protection and Violet providing a home that was an escape for Attlee from political turmoil. She died in 1964.<ref>Bew, ''Clement Attlee'' pp 115\u201318.</ref> They had four children:\n* Lady Janet Helen (born 1923); she married Harold Shipton at [[Ellesborough]] Parish Church in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|title=Janet Attlee's wedding 1947|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/janet-attlees-wedding|publisher=British Pathe}}</ref>\n* Lady Felicity Ann (1925\u20132007), married John Harwood at [[Little Hampden]] in 1955<ref>{{cite web|title=Felicity Attlee weds 1955|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/news-flashes-felicity-attlee-weds/query/Attlee|publisher=British Pathe}}</ref>\n* [[Martin Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee|Martin Richard, Viscount Prestwood, later 2nd Earl Attlee]] (1927\u20131991)\n* Lady Alison Elizabeth (1930\u20132016),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://announcements.telegraph.co.uk/deaths/209433/davis|title=DAVIS \u2013 Deaths Announcements \u2013 Telegraph Announcements|publisher=}}</ref> married Richard Davis at [[Great Missenden]] in 1952.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mr. Attlee's Daughter Weds \u2013 Alison Attlee\u2026 1952|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/mr-attlees-daughter-weds-alison-attlee-to-r-davis|publisher=British Pathe|accessdate=25 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early political career==\n\n===Local politics===\nAttlee returned to [[Local government|local politics]] in the immediate [[post-war period]], becoming mayor of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]], one of London's most deprived inner-city boroughs, in 1919. During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle [[slum]] [[landlord]]s who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, reducing the infant mortality rate, and took action to find work for returning unemployed ex-servicemen.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=62\u201363}}\n\nIn 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, ''The Social Worker'', which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:<blockquote>In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways \u2013 they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/socialworker00attliala ''The Social Worker Attlee'' (pg. 30)], archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.</ref></blockquote>\n\nand went on to say at page 75:<blockquote>Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. A right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipient's character, and terminable at his caprice.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/socialworker00attliala ''The Social Worker Attlee'' (pg. 75)], archive.org; accessed 25 March 2016.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1921, [[George Lansbury]], the Labour mayor of the neighbouring borough of [[Metropolitan Borough of Poplar|Poplar]], and future Labour Party leader, launched the [[Poplar Rates Rebellion]]; a campaign of disobedience seeking to equalise the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. Attlee, who was a personal friend of Lansbury strongly supported this, however [[Herbert Morrison]], the Labour mayor of nearby [[Metropolitan Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], and one of the main figures in the [[London Labour Party]], strongly denounced Lansbury and the rebellion. During this period, Attlee developed a lifelong dislike of Morrison.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||p=122}}<ref name=\"Attlee\">Howell, David.

At the time, he admired [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and helped him get elected as Labour Party leader at the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1922|1922 leadership election]]. He served as MacDonald's [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] for the brief 1922 parliament. His first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the short-lived [[First Labour Government (UK)|first Labour government]], led by MacDonald.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=74\u201377}}\n\nAttlee opposed the [[UK General Strike 1926|1926 General Strike]], believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. However, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike, he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee (although not against the Conservative members who had also supported this). The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay \u00a3300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.{{sfn|Beckett|1998||pp=80\u201382}}\n\nIn 1927, he was appointed a member of the multi-party [[Simon Commission]], a [[royal commission]] set up to examine the possibility of granting [[Self-governance|self-rule]] to [[British Raj|India]]. Due to the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise MacDonald made to Attlee to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the [[Second Labour Government]], which entered office after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|1929 general election]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=83\u201391}} Attlee's service on the Commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to India and many of its political leaders. By 1933 he argued that British rule was alien to India and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for India's progress. He became the British leader most sympathetic to Indian independence (as a dominion), preparing him for his role in deciding on independence in 1947.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Brasted Howard, Bridge Carl | year = 1988 | title = The British Labour Party and Indian Nationalism, 1907\u20101947 | url = | journal = South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies | volume = 11 | issue = 2| pages = 69\u201399 | doi=10.1080/00856408808723113}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1930, Labour MP [[Oswald Mosley]] left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem, and Attlee was given Mosley's post of [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]]. In March 1931, he became [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], a post he held for five months until August, when the [[History of the British Labour Party#Great Depression and the split under MacDonald|Labour government fell]], after failing to agree on how to tackle the financial crisis of the [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=96\u201399}} That month MacDonald and a few of his allies formed a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]], leading them to be expelled from Labour. MacDonald offered Attlee a job in the National Government, but he turned down the offer and opted to stay loyal to the main Labour party.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=101\u2013102}}\n\nAfter Ramsay MacDonald formed the National Government, Labour was deeply divided. Attlee had long been close to MacDonald and now felt betrayed\u2014as did most Labour politicians. During the course of the second Labour government, Attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with MacDonald, whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent, and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography. He would write:<ref>[http://spartacus-educational.com/PRmacdonald.htm Contains excerpt from Attlee's biography towards the bottom of the page]; accessed 26 July 2017.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>In the old days I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine presence and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the [[First World War]] seemed to mark him as a man of character. Despite his mishandling of the [[Zinoviev letter|Red Letter]] episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.</blockquote>\n\n==1930s opposition==\n\n===Deputy Leader===\nThe [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] held later that year was a disaster for the Labour Party, which lost over 200 seats, returning only 52 MPs to Parliament. The vast majority of the party's senior figures lost their seats, including the Leader [[Arthur Henderson]], Attlee narrowly retained his Limehouse seat in the election, with his majority being slashed from 7,288 to just 551. He was one of only three Labour MPs who had experience of government to retain their seats, along with [[George Lansbury]] and [[Stafford Cripps]], accordingly Lansbury was elected Leader unopposed with Attlee as his deputy.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=104\u2013105}}\n\nMost of the remaining Labour MPs after 1931 were elderly trade union officials who could not contribute much to debates, Lansbury was in his 70s, and Stafford Cripps another main figure of the Labour front bench who had entered Parliament in 1931, was inexperienced. As one of the most capable and experienced of the remaining Labour MPs, Attlee therefore shouldered a lot of the burden of providing an opposition to the National Government in the years 1931\u201335, during this time he had to extend his knowledge of subjects which he had not studied in any depth before, such as finance and foreign affairs in order to provide an effective opposition to the government.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=108\u2013109}}\n\nAttlee effectively served as acting leader for nine months from December 1933, after Lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident, which raised Attlee's public profile considerably. It was during this period, however, that personal financial problems almost forced Attlee to quit politics altogether. His wife had become ill, and at that time there was no separate salary for the [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. On the verge of resigning from Parliament, he was persuaded to stay by Stafford Cripps, a wealthy socialist, who agreed to make a donation to party funds to pay him an additional salary until Lansbury could take over again.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nDuring 1932\u201333 Attlee flirted with, and then drew back from radicalism, influenced by Stafford Cripps who was then on the radical wing of the party, he was briefly a member of the [[Socialist League (UK, 1932)|Socialist League]], which had been formed by former [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) members, who opposed the ILP's disaffiliation from the main Labour Party in 1932. At one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by Cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act, allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy. He admired [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s strong-armed rule and use of major generals to control England. After looking more closely at Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and even his former colleague Oswald Mosley, leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in Britain, Attlee retreated from his radicalism, and distanced himself from the League, and argued instead that the Labour Party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against [[totalitarianism]] of either the left or right. He always supported the crown, and as Prime Minister was close to King George VI.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Attlee |first=Clement |date=18 February 1952 |title=Tribute from Labor's Attlee to George and the monarchy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFQEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA30 |magazine=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |volume=32 |number=7 |quote=It was my privilege for six years to serve King George as First Minister of the Crown and for five years during the war as Deputy Prime Minister.

Lansbury had strongly opposed the policy, and felt unable to continue leading the party. Taking advantage of the disarray in the Labour Party, the Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] announced on 19 October that a general election would be held on 14 November. With no time for a leadership contest, the party agreed that Attlee should serve as interim leader, on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=116\u2013117}} Attlee therefore led Labour through the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 election]], which saw the party stage a partial comeback from its disastrous 1931 performance, winning 38 per cent of the vote, the highest share Labour had won up to that point, and gaining over one hundred seats.{{sfn|Thomas-Symonds|2012|pp=68\u201370}}\n\nAttlee stood in the subsequent [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1935|leadership election]], held soon after, where he was opposed by [[Herbert Morrison]], who had just re-entered parliament in the recent election, and [[Arthur Greenwood]]: Morrison was seen as the favourite, but was distrusted by many sections of the party, especially the left-wing. Arthur Greenwood meanwhile was a popular figure in the party; however his leadership bid was severely hampered by his [[alcoholism|alcohol problem]]. Attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure, particularly having already led the party through a general election. He went on to come first in both the first and second ballots, formally being elected Leader of the Labour Party on 3 December 1935.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=121\u2013130}}\n\nThroughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the Labour Party's official policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and [[collective security]] under the [[League of Nations]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Rhiannon Vickers|title=The Labour Party and the World, Volume 1: The Evolution of Labour's Foreign Policy, 1900\u201351|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8XbLCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA92|year=2013|publisher=Manchester UP|page=92}}</ref> At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, \"We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty.

Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the [[Soviet Union]], created \"A chance to call a halt in the armaments race...We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament.

Attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it, saying the budget:\n{{quote|was the natural expression of the character of the present Government. There was hardly any increase allowed for the services which went to build up the life of the people, education and health. Everything was devoted to piling up the instruments of death. The Chancellor expressed great regret that he should have to spend so much on armaments, but said that it was absolutely necessary and was due only to the actions of other nations. One would think to listen to him that the Government had no responsibility for the state of world affairs....The Government has now resolved to enter upon an arms race, and the people will have to pay for their mistake in believing that it could be trusted to carry out a policy of peace.... This is a War Budget. We can look in the future for no advance in Social Legislation. All available resources are to be devoted to armaments.<ref>\"Mr. Attlee on a war budget\", ''The Times'', 23 April 1936, p. 16.</ref>}}\n\nIn June 1936, the Conservative MP [[Duff Cooper]] called for an Anglo-French alliance against possible German aggression and called for all parties to support one. Attlee condemned this: \"We say that any suggestion of an alliance of this kind\u2014an alliance in which one country is bound to another, right or wrong, by some overwhelming necessity\u2014is contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations, is contrary to the Covenant, is contrary to Locarno is contrary to the obligations which this country has undertaken, and is contrary to the professed policy of this Government.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1936/jun/29/mr-duff-cooprrs-speech|title=MR.

By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose Neville Chamberlain's policy of [[appeasement]].{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=131\u2013134}}\n\nIn 1938, Attlee opposed the [[Munich Agreement]], in which Chamberlain negotiated with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Sudetenland]]: <blockquote>We all feel relief that war has not come this time. Every one of us has been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt that we are in the midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat. ... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1938/oct/03/prime-ministers-statement|title=Prime Minister's Statement|volume=339 cc40-162|publisher=Commons and Lords Hansard|date=3 October 1938|accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt the end of 1937, Attlee and a party of three Labour MPs visited Spain and visited the [[British Battalion]] of the [[International Brigades]] fighting in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. One of the companies was named the \"Major Attlee Company\" in his honour.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=134\u2013135}}\n\nIn 1937, Attlee wrote a book entitled ''The Labour Party in Perspective'', which sold fairly well, in which he set out some of his views. He argued that there was no point in Labour compromising on its socialist principles in the belief that this would achieve electoral success. He wrote:{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=140\u2013141}}\n\n<blockquote>'I find that the proposition often reduces itself to this \u2013 that if the Labour Party would drop its socialism and adopt a Liberal platform, many Liberals would be pleased to support it. I have heard it said more than once that if Labour would only drop its policy of [[nationalisation]] everyone would be pleased, and it would soon obtain a majority. I am convinced it would be fatal for the Labour Party...'</blockquote>\n\nHe also wrote, that there was no point in:\n\n<blockquote>'watering down Labour's socialist creed in order to attract new adherents who cannot accept the full socialist faith. On the contrary, I believe that it is only a clear and bold policy that will attract this support'</blockquote>\n\n==Deputy Prime Minister==\n[[File:Attlee 1941 P 75.jpg|thumb|Attlee as Lord Privy Seal, visiting a munitions factory in 1941]]\nAttlee remained as Leader of the Opposition when the [[Second World War]] broke out in September 1939.

Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by [[Winston Churchill]] on 10 May 1940.<ref name=\"Attlee\"/>\n\nAttlee and Churchill quickly agreed that the [[War cabinet#Churchill war ministry|War Cabinet]] would consist of three Conservatives (initially Churchill, Chamberlain and [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]) and two Labour members (initially himself and [[Arthur Greenwood]]) and that Labour should have slightly more than one third of the posts in the coalition government.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=157\u2013158}} Attlee and Greenwood played a vital role in supporting Churchill during a series of [[May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis|War Cabinet debates]] over whether or not to negotiate peace terms with Hitler following the [[Fall of France]] in May 1940, both supported Churchill and gave him the majority he needed in the War Cabinet to continue Britain's resistance.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|pp=163\u2013164}}<ref name=\"Marr\">Marr, Andrew.

Attlee was initially the [[Lord Privy Seal]], before becoming Britain's first ever [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]] in 1942, as well as becoming the [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs|Dominions Secretary]] and the [[Lord President of the Council]].<ref name=\"Attlee\"/><ref name=\"Marr\"/>\n\nAttlee himself played a generally low key but vital role in the wartime government, working behind the scenes and in committees to ensure the smooth operation of government. In the [[Churchill war ministry|coalition government]], three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. Churchill chaired the first two, the [[War Cabinet]] and the [[Defence Select Committee|Defence Committee]], with Attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in Parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee himself instituted, and later chaired the third body, the [[Lord President's Committee]], which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs. As Churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men. Attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with Churchill's backing, streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees. He also acted as a concilliator in the government, smoothing over tensions which frequently arose between Labour and Conservative Ministers.{{sfn|Beckett|1998|p=164}}<ref name=\"Attlee\"/><ref name=\"govclem\">{{cite web|title=Clement Attlee: enigmatic, out of time \u2013 and formidable|url=https://history.blog.gov.uk/2014/03/11/clement-attlee-enigmatic-out-of-time-and-formidable/|first=Robert|last= Crowcroft|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=3 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany Labour activists were baffled by the top leadership role for a man they regarded as having little charisma; [[Beatrice Webb]] wrote in her diary in early 1940:\n:He looked and spoke like an insignificant elderly clerk, without distinction in the voice, manner or substance of his discourse.

This mood was epitomised in the [[Beveridge Report]] of 1942, by the Liberal economist [[William Beveridge]]. The ''Report'' assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of post-war governments, and that this would provide the basis for the [[welfare state]]. Immediately on its release, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies.

Regulations issued in February 1946 applied to factories involved with \"manufacturing briquettes or blocks of fuel consisting of coal, coal dust, coke or slurry with pitch as a binding substance,\" and concerned \"dust and ventilation, washing facilities and clothing accommodation, medical supervision and examination, skin and eye protection and messrooms.\"{{sfn|Kay|1946}}\n\n====Nationalisation====\nAttlee's government also carried out their manifesto commitment for [[nationalisation]] of basic industries and public utilities. The [[Bank of England]] and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946. [[National Coal Board|Coal mining]], the [[British Railways|railways]], road haulage, canals and [[Cable & Wireless plc|Cable and Wireless]] were nationalised in 1947, electricity and gas followed in 1948. The [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain|steel industry]] was nationalised in 1951. By 1951 about 20 per cent of the British economy had been taken into [[public ownership]].<ref name=\"A History of the British Labour Party\"/>\n\nNationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked. It did, however, bring about significant material gains for workers in the form of higher wages, reduced working hours,<ref>Pelling, Henry.

''The Labour Party since 1945''.<!--publisher, page(s), ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nWithin a few years of nationalisation, a number of progressive measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme (with proper standards at all the collieries), a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface, and the making of pithead baths into a standard facility.<ref>Kynaston, David.

Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialists relationships in the workplace.<ref name=\"autogenerated5\"/></blockquote>\n\n====Agriculture====\nThe Attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the [[Agriculture Act 1947]] established a more generous subsidy system for farmers.{{sfn|Morgan|1984}} Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/farming-agriculture-acts.htm|title=The Cabinet Papers &#124; Farming and the Agriculture Acts|publisher=Nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=2 October 2011}}</ref><ref>Self, Peter & Herbert J.

This reform was eventually carried out by [[Harold Wilson's]] government. During its time in office, the Attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent, from \u00a36.5&nbsp;billion to \u00a310&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Beech|Lee|2008}}\n\n====Economy====\nThe most significant problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the [[war effort]] had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of her national wealth. Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the [[balance of trade]]. This resulted in strict [[rationing]] of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its financial state.\n\nThe abrupt end of the American [[Lend-Lease]] program in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. Some relief was provided by the [[Anglo-American loan]], negotiated in December 1945. The conditions attached to the loan included making the [[pound sterling|pound]] fully [[convertibility|convertible]] to the US dollar.

The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted by [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Ernest Bevin]]. Attlee also attended the later stages of the [[Potsdam Conference]], where he negotiated with President [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[Joseph Stalin]].\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britain's former war-time ally, Stalin and the [[Soviet Union]]. Ernest Bevin was a passionate [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]], based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. Bevin's initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary was \"wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile.\"{{sfn|Morgan|1984}} Attlee himself sought warm relations with Stalin. He put his trust in the United Nations, rejected notions that the Soviet Union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating Moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. This put Attlee at sword's point with his foreign minister, the Foreign Office, and the military who all saw the Soviets as a growing threat to Britain's role in the Middle East. Suddenly in January 1947, Attlee reversed his position and agreed with Bevin on a hard-line anti-Soviet policy.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Smith Raymond, Zametica John | year = 1985 | title = The Cold Warrior: Clement Attlee reconsidered, 1945\u20137 | url = | journal = International Affairs | volume = 61 | issue = 2| pages = 237\u201352 | doi=10.2307/2617482}}</ref>\n\nIn an early \"good-will\" gesture that was later heavily criticised, the Attlee government allowed the Soviets access, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR [[Trade pact|Trade Agreement]], to several [[Rolls-Royce Nene]] [[jet engine]]s. The Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the Nene and installed their own version in the [[Mikoyan\u2013Gurevich MiG-15|MiG-15]] interceptor, used to good effect against US-UK forces in the subsequent [[Korean War]], as well as in several later MiG models.<ref>Gordon, Yefim.

The Attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful [[NATO]] defence alliance to protect Western Europe against any Soviet aggression.{{sfnm |1a1=Morgan |1y=1984 |1loc=ch.&nbsp;6 |2a1=Thomas-Symonds |2y=2012 |2pp=2\u20134, 127}} In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war Europe, Attlee's Cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American [[Marshall Plan]] for the economic recovery of Europe.

In terms of the [[machinery of government]], he was one of the most businesslike and effective of all the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|UK Prime Ministers]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nHis leadership style of consensual government, acting as a chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. [[Christopher Soames]], the British Ambassador to France during the Conservative government of [[Edward Heath]] and cabinet minister under [[Margaret Thatcher]], remarked that \"Mrs Thatcher was not really running a team. Every time you have a Prime Minister who wants to make all the decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. Attlee didn't. That's why he was so damn good.\"<ref>Hennessy, Peter. ''The Prime Minister: The Office and its Holders since 1945'', Chapter 7, p. 150<!--publisher, ISSN/ISBN needed--></ref>\n\nThatcher herself wrote in her 1995 memoirs, which charted her beginnings in [[Grantham]] to her victory at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], that she admired Attlee, writing: \"Of Clement Attlee, however, I was an admirer. He was a serious man and a patriot. Quite contrary to the general tendency of politicians in the 1990s, he was all substance and no show.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Clement Attlee (excerpts from M, Thatcher in primary sources section towards bottom)|url=https://spartacus-educational.com/TUattlee.htm|publisher=spartacus educational|accessdate=2 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nAttlee's government presided over the successful transition from a [[war economy|wartime economy]] to peacetime, tackling problems of demobilisation, shortages of foreign [[currency]], and adverse deficits in trade balances and [[government spending|government expenditure]]. Further domestic policies that he brought about included the creation of the [[National Health Service]] and the post-war [[Welfare State]], which became key to the reconstruction of post-war Britain. Attlee and his ministers did much to transform the UK into a more prosperous and [[egalitarian]] society during their time in office with reductions in poverty and a rise in the general economic security of the population.<ref>Tanner, Duncan; [[Pat Thane]] & Nick Tiratsoo.

He proved a loyal ally of the [[United States]] at the onset of the [[Cold War]]. Due to his style of leadership, it was not he, but Ernest Bevin who masterminded foreign policy. It was Attlee's government that decided Britain should have an independent nuclear weapons programme, and work on it began in 1947.<ref>{{cite book|author=Regina Cowen Karp, ed.|title=Security with Nuclear Weapons?: Different Perspectives on National Security|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zsJZqRhObqYC&pg=PA145|year=1991|publisher=Oxford UP|page=145ff}}</ref>\n\nBevin, Attlee's Foreign Secretary, famously stated that \"We've got to have it and it's got to have a bloody [[Union Flag|Union Jack]] on it.\" The first operational [[Operation Hurricane|British A Bomb]] was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office. Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US [[McMahon Act]], which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US\u2013UK collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries. British atomic bomb research was kept secret even from some members of Attlee's own cabinet, whose loyalty or discretion seemed uncertain.<ref>Peter Hennessy, ''Cabinets and the Bomb'', Oxford University Press, 2007.</ref>\n\nAlthough a [[socialist]], Attlee still believed in the [[British Empire]] of his youth. He thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]] as a model, he continued the transformation of the empire into the modern-day [[British Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Lloyd Lorna | year = 1997 | title = Britain and the transformation from empire to Commonwealth: The significance of the immediate post\u2010war years | url = | journal = The Round Table | volume = 86 | issue = 343| pages = 333\u2013360 | doi=10.1080/00358539708454371}}</ref>\n\nHis greatest achievement, surpassing many of these, was perhaps the establishment of a political and economic consensus about the governance of Britain that all three major parties subscribed to for three decades, fixing the arena of political discourse until the late-1970s.<ref>Peter Clarke, \"Attlee: The Making of the Postwar Consensus\" in Peter Clarke, ''A Question of Leadership: Gladstone to Thatcher'' (Harmondsworth, 1992), pp. 193\u201321</ref> In 2004, [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|he was voted]] the most successful British Prime Minister of the 20th century by a poll of 139 academics organised by [[MORI|Ipsos MORI]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=661 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110912105223/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/poll.aspx?oItemId=661 |dead-url=yes |archivedate=12 September 2011 |title=Rating British Prime Ministers |publisher=Ipsos MORI |date=29 November 2004 |accessdate=2 October 2011  }}</ref>\n\nSeveral years after his death, a street on a new housing development in [[Tividale]], [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], was named Attlee Close in his memory.

[[Poetry of Catullus|His surviving works]] are still read widely and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art.\n\nCatullus's poems were widely appreciated by other poets. He greatly influenced [[Ovid]], [[Horace]], [[Virgil]], and others. After his rediscovery in the [[Late Middle Ages]], Catullus again found admirers. The explicit sexual imagery which he uses in some of his poems has shocked many readers. Indeed, Catullus's work was never canonical in schools, although his body of work is still frequently read from secondary school to graduate programs across the world, with his [[Catullus 64|64th]] poem often considered his greatest.\n\n==Life==\nGaius Valerius Catullus ({{IPA-la|\u02c8\u0261a\u02d0.i.\u028as wa\u02c8\u026b\u025b.ri.\u028as ka\u02c8t\u028al.l\u028as|classical}}) was born to a leading [[Equestrian (Roman)|equestrian]] family of [[Verona, Italy|Verona]], in [[Cisalpine Gaul]].

His friends there included the poets [[Licinius Macer Calvus|Licinius Calvus]], and [[Helvius Cinna]], Quintus Hortensius (son of [[Quintus Hortensius|the orator]] and rival of [[Cicero]]) and the biographer [[Cornelius Nepos]], to whom Catullus dedicated a ''[[libellus]]'' of poems,<ref name=bio/> the relation of which to the extant collection remains a matter of debate.<ref>M. Skinner, \"Authorial Arrangement of the Collection\", pp. 46\u201348, in: ''A Companion to Catullus'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007.</ref> He appears to have been acquainted with the poet [[Marcus Furius Bibaculus]]. A number of prominent contemporaries appear in his poetry, including Cicero, Caesar and [[Pompey]]. According to an anecdote preserved by [[Suetonius]], Caesar did not deny that Catullus's lampoons left an indelible stain on his reputation, but when Catullus apologized, he invited the poet for dinner the very same day.<ref>Suetonius ''Divus Iulius'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,1348,011:73 73]\".</ref>\n\n[[File:Catullus at Lesbia's by Sir Laurence Alma Tadema.jpg|thumb|left|''Catullus at Lesbia's'' by Sir [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]\nIt was probably in Rome that Catullus fell deeply in love with the \"[[Lesbia]]\" of his poems, who is usually identified with [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia Metelli]], a sophisticated woman from the aristocratic house of patrician family Claudii Pulchri, sister of the infamous [[Publius Clodius Pulcher]], and wife to proconsul Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer. In his poems Catullus describes several stages of their relationship: initial euphoria, doubts, separation, and his wrenching feelings of loss. Clodia had several other partners; \"From the poems one can adduce no fewer than five lovers in addition to Catullus: Egnatius (poem 37), Gellius (poem 91), Quintius (poem 82), Rufus (poem 77), and Lesbius (poem 79).\" There is also some question surrounding her husband's mysterious death in 59 B.C., some critics believing he was domestically poisoned. Yet, a sensitive and passionate Catullus could not relinquish his flame for Clodia, regardless of her obvious indifference to his desire for a deep and permanent relationship. In his poems, Catullus wavers between devout, sweltering love and bitter, scornful insults that he directs at her blatant infidelity (as demonstrated in poems 11 and 58). His passion for her is unrelenting\u2014yet it is unclear when exactly the couple split up for good. Catullus's poems about the relationship display striking depth and psychological insight.<ref>{{cite book|last=Howe, Jr.|first=Quincy|title=Introduction to Catullus, The Complete Poems for American Readers|year=1970|publisher=E.

While in the East, he traveled to the [[Troad]] to perform rites at his brother's tomb, an event recorded in a moving poem.<ref name=bio/>\n\n[[Image:REmpire-29 Bithynia.png|thumb|right|[[Bithynia]] within the Roman Empire]]\nThere survives no ancient biography of Catullus: his life has to be pieced together from scattered references to him in other ancient authors and from his poems. Thus it is uncertain when he was born and when he died. [[St. Jerome]] says that he died in his 30th year, and was born in 87 BC. But the poems include references to events of 55 and 54 BC. Since the Roman [[fasti consulares|consular fasti]] make it somewhat easy to confuse 87\u201357 BC with 84\u201354 BC, many scholars accept the dates 84 BC\u201354 BC,<ref name=bio/> supposing that his latest poems and the publication of his ''libellus'' coincided with the year of his death. Other authors suggest 52 or 51 BC as the year of the poet's death.<ref>M. Skinner, \"Introduction\", p.3, in: ''A Companion to Catullus'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.</ref> Though upon his elder brother's death Catullus lamented that their \"whole house was buried along\" with the deceased, the existence (and prominence) of ''Valerii Catulli'' is attested in the following centuries. [[T.P. Wiseman]] argues that after the brother's death Catullus could have married, and that, in this case, the later ''Valerii Catulli'' may have been his descendants.<ref>T.P. Wiseman, \"The Valerii Catulli of Verona\", in: M. Skinner, ed., ''A Companion to Catullus'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Poetry==\n{{Main|Poetry of Catullus}}\n{{See also|List of poems by Catullus}}\n[[File:Catullus et in eum commentarius.tif|thumb|''Catullus et in eum commentarius'' (1554)]]\n\n===Sources and organization===\nCatullus's poems have been preserved in an [[anthology]] of 116 ''carmina'' (the actual number of poems may slightly vary in various editions), which can be divided into three parts according to their form: sixty short poems in varying meters, called ''[[polymetra]]'', eight longer poems, and forty-eight [[epigram]]s.\n\nThere is no scholarly consensus on whether Catullus himself arranged the order of the poems. The longer poems differ from the ''polymetra'' and the epigrams not only in length but also in their subjects: There are seven [[hymn]]s and one mini-[[epic poetry|epic]], or epyllion, the most highly prized form for the \"[[Neoteric#Latin Neoterics|new poets]]\".\n\nThe ''polymetra'' and the epigrams can be divided into four major [[Theme (literature)|thematic]] groups (ignoring a rather large number of poems that elude such categorization):\n\n* poems to and about his friends (e.g., an invitation like poem 13).\n* [[erotic]] poems: some of them ([[Catullus 50|50]] and [[Catullus 99|99]]) are about his homosexual desires and acts, but most are about women, especially about one he calls \"[[Lesbia]]\" (which served as a false name for his married girlfriend, [[Claudia Pulchra (wife of Metellus)|Clodia]], source and inspiration of many of his poems).\n* [[invective]]s: often rude and sometimes downright [[obscene]] poems targeted at friends-turned-traitors (e.g., poem [[Catullus 16|16]]), other lovers of Lesbia, well-known poets, politicians (e.g., [[Julius Caesar]]) and [[rhetor]]s, including Cicero.\n* [[condolence]]s: some poems of Catullus are solemn in nature. [[Catullus 96|96]] comforts a friend in the death of a loved one; several others, most famously [[Catullus 101|101]], lament the death of his brother.\n\nAll these poems describe the lifestyle of Catullus and his friends, who, despite Catullus's temporary political post in Bithynia, lived their lives withdrawn from politics. They were interested mainly in poetry and love. Above all other qualities, Catullus seems to have valued ''venustas'', or charm, in his acquaintances, a theme which he explores in a number of his poems. The ancient Roman concept of ''virtus'' (i.e. of [[virtue]] that had to be proved by a political or military career), which [[Cicero]] suggested as the solution to the societal problems of the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]], meant little to them.\n\nHowever Catullus does not reject traditional notions, but rather their particular application to the ''[[vita activa]]'' of politics and war. Indeed, he tries to reinvent these notions from a personal point of view and to introduce them into human relationships. For example, he applies the word ''fides'', which traditionally meant faithfulness towards one's political allies, to his relationship with Lesbia and reinterprets it as unconditional faithfulness in love. So, despite the seeming frivolity of his lifestyle, Catullus measured himself and his friends by quite ambitious standards.\n\n===Intellectual influences===\nCatullus's poetry was influenced by the innovative poetry of the [[Hellenistic Age]], and especially by [[Callimachus]] and the Alexandrian school, which had propagated a new style of poetry that deliberately turned away from the classical [[epic poetry]] in the tradition of [[Homer]]. Cicero called these local innovators  ''[[neoteroi]]'' (\u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03b9) or 'moderns' (in Latin ''[[Neoteric#Latin Neoterics|poetae novi]]'' or '[[Neoteric#Latin Neoterics|new poets]]'), in that they cast off the heroic model handed down from [[Ennius]] in order to strike new ground and ring a contemporary note. Catullus and Callimachus did not describe the feats of ancient [[hero]]es and gods (except perhaps in re-evaluating and predominantly artistic circumstances, e.g. poems 63 and 64), focusing instead on small-scale personal themes. Although these poems sometimes seem quite superficial and their subjects often are mere everyday concerns, they are accomplished works of art. Catullus described his work as ''expolitum'', or polished, to show that the language he used was very carefully and artistically composed.\n\nCatullus was also an admirer of [[Sappho]], a female poet of the seventh century BC, and is the source for much of what we know or infer about her. [[Catullus 51]] follows [[Sappho 31]] so closely that some believe the later poem to be, in part, a direct translation of the earlier poem, and [[Catullus 61|61]] and [[Catullus 62|62]] are certainly inspired by and perhaps translated directly from lost works of Sappho. Both of the latter are ''[[Epithalamium|epithalamia]]'', a form of [[wikt:laudatory|laudatory]] or erotic wedding-poetry that Sappho had been famous for but that had gone out of fashion in the intervening centuries. Catullus twice used a meter that Sappho developed, called the Sapphic [[strophe]], in poems [[Catullus 11|11]] and 51. In fact, Catullus may have brought about a substantial revival of that form in Rome.\n\nCatullus, as was common to his era, was greatly influenced by stories from Greek and Roman myth. His longer poems\u2014such as [[Catullus 63|63]], [[Catullus 64|64]], [[Catullus 65|65]], [[Catullus 66|66]], and [[Catullus 68|68]]\u2014allude to mythology in various ways. Some stories he refers to are the wedding of [[Peleus]] and [[Thetis]], the departure of the [[Argonauts]], [[Theseus]] and the Minotaur, [[Ariadne]]'s abandonment, [[Tereus]] and [[Procne]], as well as [[Protesilaus|Protesilaus and Laodamia]].\n\n===Style===\nCatullus wrote in many different meters including hendecasyllabic verse and elegiac couplets (common in love poetry). A great part of his poetry shows strong and occasionally wild emotions, especially in regard to [[Lesbia]]. Catullus describes his Lesbia as having multiple suitors and often showing little affection towards him. He also demonstrates a great sense of humour such as in [[Catullus 13]].\n\n===Musical settings===\n''Catullus Dreams'' (2011) is a song cycle by David Glaser set to texts of Catullus. The cycle is scored for soprano and seven instruments. It was premiered at Symphony Space in New York by soprano Linda Larson and Sequitur Ensemble.\n\n''[[Catulli Carmina]]'' is a [[cantata]] by [[Carl Orff]] to the texts of Catullus.\n\n\"Carmina Catulli\" is a song cycle arranged from 17 of Catullus' poems by American composer Michael Linton. The cycle was recorded in December 2013 and premiered at Carnegie Hall's Weill Recital Hall in March 2014 by French baritone Edwin Crossley-Mercer and pianist Jason Paul Peterson.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://refinersfire.us/linton-carmina-catulli/ | publisher=RefinersFire | title=New Release: Linton: Carmina Catulli | accessdate=October 8, 2014 | date=August 19, 2014 | last=McMurtry | first=Chris | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008192346/http://refinersfire.us/linton-carmina-catulli/ | archivedate=October 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2015/2/Recordings/LINTON__Carmina_Catulli.html|title=LINTON: Carmina Catulli|website=www.operanews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forumopera.com/cd/carmina-catulli-priape-lesbie-diane-et-caetera|title=Priape, Lesbie, Diane et caetera - Forum Op\u00e9ra|website=www.forumopera.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Catullus 5]], the love poem \"Vivamus mea Lesbia atque amemus\", in the translation by [[Ben Jonson]] was set to music<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://gerbode.net/ft2/composers//Ferrabosco/songs/06_come_my_celia/pdf/06_come_my_celia.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 20, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005184436/http://gerbode.net/ft2/composers//Ferrabosco/songs/06_come_my_celia/pdf/06_come_my_celia.pdf |archive-date=October 5, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ([[lute]] accompanied song) by [[Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger]].

Two of the Hornblower books, ''[[A Ship of the Line]]'' and ''[[Flying Colours (novel)|Flying Colours]]'', were jointly awarded the [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction in 1938.  His other works include ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' (1935; filmed in 1951 by [[John Huston]]).\n\n==Early years==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}\nForester was born in [[Cairo]] and, after a family breakup at an early age, moved with his mother to London, where he was educated at [[Alleyn's School]] and [[Dulwich College]], south London. He began to study medicine at [[Guy's Hospital]], London, but left without completing his degree. Forester had always worn glasses and been of slender physique. Trying to enlist in the army, he failed his physical and was told there was not a chance that he would be accepted, even though he was of good height and somewhat athletic. Around 1921, after leaving Guy's, he began writing seriously using his pen name. It is interesting to note that the name of his primary literary character Hornblower was undoubtedly taken from a fellow Alleyn's pupil.  A Hornblower is listed on the 14-18 War Memorial at the School.\n\n==Second World War==\nDuring the Second World War, Forester moved to the United States, where he worked for the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|British Ministry of Information]] and wrote propaganda to encourage the US to join the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. He eventually settled in [[Berkeley, California]]. In 1942, while living in [[Washington, D.C.]], he met a young British intelligence officer named [[Roald Dahl]], whose experiences in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] he had heard about, and encouraged him to write about them.<ref name=Dahl>Sturrock, Donald (2010). ''Storyteller: The Life of Roald Dahl''. p. 168. [[Harper Collins]]. Retrieved 28 October 2012</ref> According to Dahl's autobiographical ''Lucky Break'', Forester asked Dahl about his experiences as a fighter pilot. This prompted Dahl to write his first story, \"A Piece of Cake\".<ref name=Dahl />\n\n==Literary career==\n{{refimprove section|date=July 2017}}\n[[File:Famous fantastic mysteries 194802.jpg|thumb|Forester's 1934 SF novel ''The Peacemaker'' was reprinted in ''[[Famous Fantastic Mysteries]]'' in 1948]]\n\nForester wrote many novels. He is best known for the 12-book [[Horatio Hornblower]] series, depicting a [[Royal Navy]] officer during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He began the series with Hornblower fairly high in rank in the first novel, published in 1937. The last completed novel was published in 1962. With demand for more stories, Forester filled in Hornblower's life story, in effect. Hornblower's fictional feats were based on real events, but Forester wrote the body of the works carefully to avoid entanglements with real world history, so that Hornblower is always off on another mission when a great naval battle occurs during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nForester's other novels include ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' (1935) and ''[[The General (C. S. Forester novel)|The General]]'' (1936); [[Peninsular War]] novels in ''[[Death to the French]]'' (published in the United States as ''Rifleman Dodd'') and ''[[The Gun (novel)|The Gun]]'' (filmed as ''[[The Pride and the Passion]]'' in 1957); and seafaring stories that did not involve Hornblower, such as ''[[Brown on Resolution]]'' (1929), ''[[The Captain from Connecticut]]'' (1941), ''[[The Ship (novel)|The Ship]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Last Nine Days of the Bismarck|Hunting the Bismarck]]'' (1959), which was used as the basis of the screenplay for the film ''[[Sink the Bismarck!]]'' (1960). Several of his works were filmed, including ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' (1951), directed by [[John Huston]]. Forester is also credited as story writer for several movies not based on his published fiction, including ''[[Commandos Strike at Dawn]]'' (1942).\n\nHe wrote several volumes of short stories set during the [[Second World War]]. Those in ''The Nightmare'' (1954) were based on events in [[Nazi Germany]], ending at the [[Nuremberg trials]].  Stories in ''The Man in the Yellow Raft'' (1969) followed the career of the destroyer USS ''Boon'', while many of those in ''Gold from Crete'' (1971) followed the destroyer HMS ''Apache''. The last of the stories in ''Gold from Crete'' was \"If Hitler had invaded England\", which offers an imagined sequence of events starting with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s attempt to implement [[Operation Sea Lion]], and culminating in the early military defeat of Nazi Germany in the summer of 1941. His non-fiction seafaring works include ''The Age of Fighting Sail'' (1956), an account of the sea battles between Great Britain and the United States in the [[War of 1812]].\n\nIn addition to his novels of seafaring life, Forester published two crime novels (''[[Payment Deferred]]'' (1926) and ''Plain Murder'' (1930)) and two children's books. ''Poo-Poo and the Dragons'' (1942) was created as a series of stories told to his younger son George to encourage him to finish his meals. George had mild food allergies that kept him feeling unwell, and he needed encouragement to eat.<ref>''Poo-Poo and the Dragons'': Preface</ref> ''The Barbary Pirates'' (1953) is a children's history of early 19th-century pirates.\n\nC.&nbsp;S. Forester appeared as a contestant on the television quiz programme ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', hosted by [[Groucho Marx]], in an episode broadcast on 1 November 1956.<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=neBitTTGr78&list=PLHaioNpr_GDbvsTj_taM-jO6C1658N1PC&index=41|title=You Bet Your Life #56-06 C.&nbsp;S.

They are defined by the [[ITU-T]] in standards [[E.123]] and [[E.164]]. The prefixes enable [[international direct dialing]] (IDD), and are also referred to as ''international subscriber dialing'' (ISD) codes.\n\n[[File:CallingCodesWorld-Labeled.svg|thumb|500px|Worldwide distribution of country calling codes colored by first digit]]\nCountry codes are a component of the international [[telephone numbering plan]], and are necessary only when dialing a [[telephone number]] to establish a call to another country. Country codes are dialed before the national telephone number. By convention, international telephone numbers are represented by prefixing the country code with a plus sign (+), which also indicates to the subscriber that the local [[List of international call prefixes|international call prefix]] must first be dialed. For example, the international call prefix in all countries belonging to the [[North American Numbering Plan]] is 011, while it is 00 in most European, Asian and African countries. On [[GSM]] (cellular) networks, the prefix may automatically be inserted when the user prefixes a dialed number with the plus sign.\n\n==Tree list==\nCountry calling codes are [[prefix code]]s and can be organized as a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]]. In each row of the table, the country codes given in the left-most column share the same first digit; then subsequent columns give the second digit in ascending order.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0\n|-\n!

Logan, ''Shakespeare's Marlowe'' (2007) p.4. \"During Marlowe's lifetime, the popularity of his plays, Robert Greene's ... remarks ... including the designation \"famous\", and the many imitations of ''Tamburlaine'' suggest that he was for a brief time considered England's foremost dramatist.\"</ref> He greatly influenced [[William Shakespeare]], who was born in the same year as Marlowe and who rose to become the pre-eminent Elizabethan playwright after Marlowe's mysterious early death. Marlowe's plays are known for the use of [[blank verse]] and their overreaching [[protagonist]]s.\n\nA warrant was issued for Marlowe's arrest on 18 May 1593. No reason was given for it, though it was thought to be connected to allegations of blasphemy\u2014a manuscript believed to have been written by Marlowe was said to contain \"vile heretical conceipts\". On 20 May, he was brought to the court to attend upon the [[Privy Council]] for questioning. There is no record of their having met that day, however, and he was commanded to attend upon them each day thereafter until \"licensed to the contrary\". Ten days later, he was stabbed to death by [[Ingram Frizer]]. Whether or not the stabbing was connected to his arrest remains unknown.<ref>Nicholl, Charles (2006). \"By my onely meanes sett downe: The Texts of Marlow's Atheism\", in Kozuka, Takashi and Mulryne, J. R. ''Shakespeare, Marlowe, Jonson: New Directions in Biography''. Ashgate Publishing, p. 153.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMarlowe was born in [[Canterbury]] to shoemaker John Marlowe and his wife Catherine. His date of birth is not known, but he was baptised on 26 February 1564, and is likely to have been born a few days before. Thus, he was just two months older than his contemporary [[William Shakespeare]], who was baptised on 26 April 1564 in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].\n\nMarlowe attended [[The King's School, Canterbury|The King's School]] in Canterbury (where a [[House system|house]] is now named after him) and [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where he studied on a scholarship and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1584.<ref>{{acad|id=MRLW580C|name=Marlowe, Christopher}}</ref> In 1587, the university hesitated to award him his Master of Arts degree because of a rumour that he intended to go to the English college at [[Rheims]], presumably to prepare for ordination as a [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] priest. However, his degree was awarded on schedule when the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] intervened on his behalf, commending him for his \"faithful dealing\" and \"good service\" to [[Elizabeth I of England|the Queen]].<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/pc_cert.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 2015).</ref> The nature of Marlowe's service was not specified by the Council, but its letter to the Cambridge authorities has provoked much speculation, notably the theory that Marlowe was operating as a secret agent working for Sir [[Francis Walsingham]]'s intelligence service.<ref>He died in a deadly brawl.{{cite book |last=Hutchinson |first=Robert |title=Elizabeth's Spy Master: Francis Walsingham and the Secret War that Saved England|publisher=Weidenfeld & Nicolson |year=2006 |location=London|page=111 |isbn =0-297-84613-2}}</ref> No direct evidence supports this theory, although the Council's letter is evidence that Marlowe had served the government in some secret capacity.\n\n==Literary career==\n{{refimprove section|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:Canterbury - Turm der St. George's Church, in der Marlowe getauft wurde.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Marlowe was christened at St George's Church, in [[Canterbury]].]]\n[[File:OldCurtCC.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The corner of Old Court of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], where Marlowe stayed during his studies.]]\nOf the dramas attributed to Marlowe, ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido, Queen of Carthage]]'' is believed to have been his first. It was performed by the [[Children of the Chapel]], a company of boy actors, between 1587 and 1593. The play was first published in 1594; the title page attributes the play to Marlowe and [[Thomas Nashe]].\n\nMarlowe's first play performed on the regular stage in London, in 1587, was ''[[Tamburlaine|Tamburlaine the Great]]'', about the conqueror [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), who rises from shepherd to warlord. It is among the first English plays in blank verse,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/16century/topic_1/welcome.htm |title=See especially the middle section in which the author shows how another Cambridge graduate, Thomas Preston makes his title character express his love in a popular play written around 1560 and compares that \"clumsy\" line with ''Doctor Faustus'' addressing Helen of Troy |publisher=Wwnorton.com |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> and, with [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', generally is considered the beginning of the mature phase of the [[Elizabethan theatre]]. ''Tamburlaine'' was a success, and was followed with ''Tamburlaine the Great, Part II''.\n\nThe two parts of ''Tamburlaine'' were published in 1590; all Marlowe's other works were published posthumously. The sequence of the writing of his other four plays is unknown; all deal with controversial themes.\n* ''[[The Jew of Malta]]'' (first published as ''The Famous Tragedy of the Rich Jew of Malta''), about the Jew Barabas' barbarous revenge against the city authorities, has a prologue delivered by a character representing [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]. It was probably written in 1589 or 1590, and was first performed in 1592. It was a success, and remained popular for the next fifty years. The play was entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 17 May 1594, but the earliest surviving printed edition is from 1633.\n* ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward the Second]]'' is an English history play about the deposition of King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] by his barons and the Queen, who resent the undue influence the king's favourites have in court and state affairs. The play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 6 July 1593, five weeks after Marlowe's death. The full title of the earliest extant edition, of 1594, is ''The troublesome reigne and lamentable death of Edward the second, King of England, with the tragicall fall of proud Mortimer.''\n* ''[[The Massacre at Paris]]'' is a short and luridly written work, the only surviving text of which was probably a [[Memorial reconstruction|reconstruction from memory]] of the original performance text,<ref>{{cite book|last=Deats|first=Sarah Munson|editor=Cheney, Patrick|title=The Cambridge Companion to Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, England|year=2004|page=193|chapter='Dido Queen of Carthage' and 'The Massacre at Paris'|isbn=0-521-82034-0}}</ref> portraying the events of the [[Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in 1572, which English Protestants invoked as the blackest example of Catholic treachery.

The earlier (A text) edition of 1604 simply had ''The Tragicall History of D. Faustus''.</ref> based on the German [[Faustbuch]], was the first dramatised version of the [[Faust]] legend of a scholar's dealing with the devil. While versions of \"The Devil's Pact\" can be traced back to the 4th century, Marlowe deviates significantly by having his hero unable to \"burn his books\" or repent to a merciful God in order to have his contract annulled at the end of the play. Marlowe's protagonist is instead carried off by demons, and in the 1616 quarto his mangled corpse is found by several scholars. Doctor Faustus is a textual problem for scholars as two versions of the play exist: the 1604 [[quarto]], also known as the A text, and the 1616 quarto or B text. Both were published after Marlowe's death. Scholars have disagreed which text is more representative of Marlowe's original, and some editions are based on a combination of the two. The latest scholarly consensus (as of the late 20th century) holds the A text is more representative because it contains irregular character names and idiosyncratic spelling, which are believed to reflect a text based on the author's handwritten manuscript, or \"[[foul papers]].\" The B text, in comparison, was highly edited, censored because of shifting theater laws regarding religious words onstage, and contains several additional scenes which scholars believe to be the additions of other playwrights, particularly [[Samuel Rowley]] and William Bird (''alias'' Borne).\n\nMarlowe's plays were enormously successful, thanks in part, no doubt, to the imposing stage presence of [[Edward Alleyn]]. Alleyn was unusually tall for the time, and the haughty roles of Tamburlaine, Faustus, and Barabas were probably written especially for him. Marlowe's plays were the foundation of the repertoire of Alleyn's company, the [[Admiral's Men]], throughout the 1590s.\n\nMarlowe also wrote the poem ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' (published in 1598, and with a continuation by [[George Chapman]] the same year), the popular lyric ''[[The Passionate Shepherd to His Love]]'', and translations of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Amores (Ovid)|Amores]]'' and the first book of [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]]'s ''[[Pharsalia]]''. In 1599, his translation of [[Ovid]] was banned and copies publicly burned as part of [[John Whitgift|Archbishop Whitgift]]'s crackdown on offensive material.\n\nMarlowe has been credited in the [[The Oxford Shakespeare|New Oxford Shakespeare]] series as co-author of the three ''[[Henry VI, Part 1|Henry VI]]'' plays, though some scholars doubt any actual collaboration.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shea|first1=Christopher D.|title=New Oxford Shakespeare Edition Credits Christopher Marlowe as a Co-author|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/25/books/shakespeare-christopher-marlowe-henry-vi.html|accessdate=24 October 2016|work=The New York Times|date=24 October 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"cowrite\">{{cite news|title=Christopher Marlowe credited as Shakespeare's co-writer|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-37750558|accessdate=24 October 2016|publisher=BBC|date=24 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Legend==\nAs with other writers of the period, little is known about Marlowe. What evidence there is can be found in legal records and other official documents. This has not stopped writers of both fiction and non-fiction from speculating about his activities and character. Marlowe has often been described as a spy, a brawler, and a heretic, as well as a \"magician\", \"duellist\", \"tobacco-user\", \"counterfeiter\", and \"[[Rake (character)|rakehell]]\". J. A. Downie and Constance Kuriyama have argued against the more lurid speculation,<ref>J. A. Downie in his and J. T. Parnell's ''Constructing Christopher Marlowe'' (2000) and Constance Kuriyama in her ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002).</ref> but [[J. B. Steane]] remarked, \"it seems absurd to dismiss all of these Elizabethan rumours and accusations as 'the Marlowe myth{{'\"}}.<ref name=\"steane\" />\n\n===Spying===\n[[File:Edward2a.jpg|thumb|200px|Title page of the earliest published text of ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' (1594)]]\nMarlowe is alleged to have been a government spy ([[Park Honan]]'s 2005 biography even had \"Spy\" in its title<ref>Park Honan, ''Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy'', 2005.</ref>). The author [[Charles Nicholl (author)|Charles Nicholl]] speculates this was the case and suggests that Marlowe's recruitment took place when he was at Cambridge. As noted above, in 1587 the Privy Council ordered the University of Cambridge to award Marlowe his degree of Master of Arts, denying rumours that he intended to go to the English Catholic college in Rheims, saying instead that he had been engaged in unspecified \"affaires\" on \"matters touching the benefit of his country\".<ref>This is from a document dated 29 June 1587, from the National Archives \u2013 ''Acts of Privy Council''.</ref> Surviving college records from the period also indicate that Marlowe had had a series of unusually lengthy absences from the university \u2013 much longer than permitted by university regulations \u2013 that began in the academic year 1584\u20131585. Surviving college [[Buttery (shop)|buttery]] (provisions store) accounts indicate he began spending lavishly on food and drink during the periods he was in attendance<ref>{{cite book|last=Nicholl|first=Charles|title=The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London |year=1992|chapter=12|isbn=0-224-03100-7}}</ref> \u2013 more than he could have afforded on his known scholarship income.{{refn|group=nb|It is known that some poorer students worked as labourers on the Corpus Christi College chapel, then under construction, and were paid by the college with extra food. It has been suggested this may be the reason for the sums noted in Marlowe's entry in the buttery accounts.<ref name=\"Riggs2004\">{{cite book|author=David Riggs|title=The World of Christopher Marlowe|page=65|year=2004|publisher=Faber|isbn=978-0-571-22159-2}}</ref>}}\n\nIt has sometimes been theorised that Marlowe was the \"Morley\" who was tutor to [[Arbella Stuart]] in 1589.<ref>He was described by Arbella's guardian, the Countess of Shrewsbury, as having hoped for an annuity of some \u00a340 from Arbella, his being \"so much damnified (i.e. having lost this much) by leaving the University.\": BL [[Lansdowne MS.]] 71, f.3.and Charles Nicholl, ''The Reckoning'' (1992), pp. 340\u20132.</ref> This possibility was first raised in a ''[[Times Literary Supplement|TLS]]'' letter by E. St John Brooks in 1937; in a letter to ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', John Baker has added that only Marlowe could be Arbella's tutor due to the absence of any other known \"Morley\" from the period with an MA and not otherwise occupied.<ref>John Baker, letter to ''Notes and Queries'' 44.3 (1997), pp. 367\u20138</ref> If Marlowe was Arbella's tutor (and some biographers think that the \"Morley\" in question may have been a brother of the musician [[Thomas Morley]]<ref>Constance Kuriyama, ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002), p. 89. Also in Handover's biography of Arbella, and Nicholl, ''The Reckoning'', p. 342.</ref>), it might indicate that he was there as a spy, since Arbella, niece of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], and cousin of James VI of Scotland, later [[James I of England]], was at the time a strong candidate for the [[succession to Elizabeth's throne]].<ref>[http://www.history.ac.uk/ihr/Focus/Elizabeth/index.html Elizabeth I and James VI and I], [http://www.history.ac.uk/ History in Focus].</ref> [[Frederick S. Boas]] dismisses the possibility of this identification, based on surviving legal records which document his \"residence in London between September and December 1589\". Marlowe had been party to a fatal quarrel involving his neighbours and the poet [[Thomas Watson (poet)|Thomas Watson]] in [[Norton Folgate]] and was held in [[Newgate Prison]] for a fortnight.<ref>Frederick S. Boas,'' Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1953), pp. 101ff.</ref> In fact, the quarrel and his arrest was on 18 September, he was released on bail on 1 October, and he had to attend court \u2013 where he was cleared of any wrongdoing \u2013 on 3 December, but there is no record of where he was for the intervening two months.<ref>Constance Kuriyama, ''Christopher Marlowe: A Renaissance Life'' (2002), p. xvi.</ref>\n\nIn 1592 Marlowe was arrested in the town of [[Flushing, Netherlands|Flushing]] (Vlissingen) (then an English [[Cautionary Towns|garrison town]]) in the Netherlands for his alleged involvement in the [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiting]] of coins, presumably related to the activities of seditious Catholics. He was sent to be dealt with by the Lord Treasurer ([[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Burghley]]) but no charge or imprisonment resulted.<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/flushing.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 2015).</ref> This arrest may have disrupted another of Marlowe's spying missions, perhaps by giving the resulting coinage to the Catholic cause.

On 11 May the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] ordered the arrest of those responsible for the libels. The next day, Marlowe's colleague [[Thomas Kyd]] was arrested. Kyd's lodgings were searched and a 3-page fragment of a [[heresy|heretical]] tract was found. In a letter to [[Sir John Puckering]], Kyd asserted that it had belonged to Marlowe,<ref>J. R.

There is no record of any meeting on either 18 or 20 May, however, just a note of the warrant being issued on 18 May and the fact that Marlowe \"entered his appearance for his indemnity therein\" on the 20th.</ref> On Wednesday, 30 May, Marlowe was killed.\n\nVarious accounts of Marlowe's death were current over the next few years. In his ''[[Palladis Tamia]]'', published in 1598, [[Francis Meres]] says Marlowe was \"stabbed to death by a bawdy serving-man, a rival of his in his lewd love\" as punishment for his \"epicurism and atheism.\"<ref>''Palladis Tamia''. London, 1598: 286v-287r.</ref> In 1917, in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Sir [[Sidney Lee]] wrote that Marlowe was killed in a drunken fight, and this is still often stated as fact today.\n\nThe official account came to light only in 1925 when the scholar [[Leslie Hotson]] discovered the [[coroner]]'s report of the inquest on Marlowe's death, held two days later on Friday 1 June 1593, by the [[Coroner of the Queen's Household]], [[William Danby (coroner)|William Danby]].<ref>For a full transcript, see [http://www.rey.myzen.co.uk/inquis~2.htm Peter Farey's Marlowe page] (Retrieved 30 April 215).</ref> Marlowe had spent all day in a house in [[Deptford, London|Deptford]], owned by the widow [[Eleanor Bull]], and together with three men: [[Ingram Frizer]], [[Nicholas Skeres]] and [[Robert Poley]]. All three had been employed by one or other of the Walsinghams. Skeres and Poley had helped snare the conspirators in the [[Babington plot]] and Frizer would later describe Thomas Walsingham as his \"master\" at that time<ref>Leslie Hotson, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'' (1925) p.65</ref> although his role was probably more that of a financial or business agent as he was for Walsingham's wife Audrey a few years later.<ref>Park Honan, ''Christopher Marlowe: Poet and Spy'' (2005) p.325</ref> These witnesses testified that Frizer and Marlowe had argued over payment of the bill (now famously known as the 'Reckoning') exchanging \"divers malicious words\" while Frizer was sitting at a table between the other two and Marlowe was lying behind him on a couch. Marlowe snatched Frizer's dagger and wounded him on the head. In the ensuing struggle, according to the coroner's report, Marlowe was stabbed above the right eye, killing him instantly. The jury concluded that Frizer acted in self-defence, and within a month he was pardoned. Marlowe was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St. Nicholas, Deptford immediately after the inquest, on 1 June 1593.<ref>Wilson, Scott.

Kindle Edition</ref>\n\nThe complete text of the inquest report was published by Leslie Hotson in his book, ''The Death of Christopher Marlowe'', in the introduction to which Prof. [[George Lyman Kittredge|G. L. Kittredge]] said \"The mystery of Marlowe's death, heretofore involved in a cloud of contradictory gossip and irresponsible guess-work, is now cleared up for good and all on the authority of public records of complete authenticity and gratifying fullness\", but this confidence proved fairly short-lived.\n\nHotson himself had considered the possibility that the witnesses had \"concocted a lying account of Marlowe's behaviour, to which they swore at the inquest, and with which they deceived the jury\" but came down against that scenario.<ref>Hotson (1925) pp.39\u201340</ref> Others, however, began to suspect that this was indeed the case. Writing to the ''Times Literary Supplement'' shortly after the book's publication, Eug\u00e9nie de Kalb disputed that the struggle and outcome as described were even possible,<ref>de Kalb, Eug\u00e9nie (May 1925). \"The Death of Marlowe\", in ''The Times Literary Supplement''</ref> and [[Samuel A. Tannenbaum]] insisted the following year that such a wound could not have possibly resulted in instant death, as had been claimed.<ref>Tannenbaum, Samuel (1926). ''The Assassination of Christopher Marlowe'', New York, pp.41\u201342</ref> Even Marlowe's biographer John Bakeless acknowledged that \"some scholars have been inclined to question the truthfulness of the coroner's report. There is something queer about the whole episode\" and said that Hotson's discovery \"raises almost as many questions as it answers.\"<ref>Bakeless, John (1942).

John 13:23\u201325), and, \"that he used him as the sinners of [[Sodom and Gomorrah|Sodom]]\". He also implies that Marlowe had Catholic sympathies. Other passages are merely sceptical in tone: \"he persuades men to atheism, willing them not to be afraid of bugbears and hobgoblins\". The final paragraph of Baines's document reads:\n\n<blockquote>These thinges, with many other shall by good & honest witnes be approved to be his opinions and Comon Speeches, and that this Marlowe doth not only hould them himself, but almost into every Company he Cometh he persuades men to Atheism willing them not to be afeard of bugbeares and hobgoblins, and vtterly scorning both god and his ministers as I Richard Baines will Justify & approue both by mine oth and the testimony of many honest men, and almost al men with whome he hath Conversed any time will testify the same, and as I think all men in Cristianity ought to indevor that the mouth of so dangerous a member may be stopped, he saith likewise that he hath quoted a number of Contrarieties oute of the Scripture which he hath giuen to some great men who in Convenient time shalbe named.

''The Herculean Hero in Marlowe, Chapman, Shakespeare, and Dryden''. Chatto and Windus, London, 1962. The idea is commonplace, though by no means universally accepted.</ref> However, plays had to be approved by the [[Master of the Revels]] before they could be performed, and the censorship of publications was under the control of the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Presumably these authorities did not consider any of Marlowe's works to be unacceptable other than the ''Amores''.\n\n===Sexuality===\nMarlowe is frequently claimed to have been homosexual. Others argue that the question of whether an Elizabethan was gay or homosexual in a modern sense is anachronistic. For the Elizabethans, what is often today termed homosexual or bisexual was more likely to be recognised as a sexual act, rather than an exclusive sexual orientation and identity.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Bruce R.|title=Homosexual desire in Shakespeare's England|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=March 1995|page=74|isbn=0-226-76366-8}}</ref> Some scholars argue that the evidence is inconclusive and that the reports of Marlowe's homosexuality may simply be exaggerated rumours produced after his death. Richard Baines reported Marlowe as saying: \"all they that love not Tobacco & Boies were fools\". [[David Bevington]] and Eric Rasmussen describe Baines's evidence as \"unreliable testimony\" and make the comment: \"These and other testimonials need to be discounted for their exaggeration and for their having been produced under legal circumstances we would regard as a witch-hunt\".<ref>''Doctor Faustus and Other Plays'', pp. viii\u2013ix</ref> One critic, [[J.B. Steane]], remarked that he considers there to be \"no ''evidence'' for Marlowe's homosexuality at all.\"<ref name=\"steane\" /> Other scholars,<ref>{{cite book |last=White|first=Paul Whitfield, ed.|title=Marlowe, History and Sexuality: New Critical Essays on Christopher Marlowe|publisher=AMS Press|location=New York|year=1998}}</ref> however, point to homosexual themes in Marlowe's writing: in ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'', Marlowe writes of the male youth Leander, \"in his looks were all that men desire\"<ref>''Hero and Leander'', 88 (see [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/21262/21262-h/21262-h.htm Project Gutenberg]).</ref> and that when the youth swims to visit Hero at [[Sestos]], the sea god [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] becomes sexually excited, \"[i]magining that Ganymede, displeas'd, [h]ad left the Heavens ... [t]he lusty god embrac'd him, call'd him love ... He watched his arms and, as they opened wide [a]t every stroke, betwixt them would he slide [a]nd steal a kiss, ...

The play was extremely bold, dealing with a star-crossed love story between [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] and [[Piers Gaveston, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Piers Gaveston]]. Though it was common practice at the time to reveal characters as gay to give audiences reason to suspect them as culprits of a given crime, Christopher Marlowe's Edward II is portrayed as a sympathetic character.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Edward the Second|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=axTzkFP9IHoC|publisher = Manchester University Press|date = 15 October 1995|isbn = 9780719030895|first = Christopher|last = Marlowe|first2 = Charles R.|last2 = Forker}}</ref>\n\n==Reputation among contemporary writers==\nWhatever the particular focus of modern critics, biographers and novelists, for his contemporaries in the literary world, Marlowe was above all an admired and influential artist. Within weeks of his death, [[George Peele]] remembered him as \"Marley, the Muses' darling\"; [[Michael Drayton]] noted that he \"Had in him those brave translunary things / That the first poets had\", and [[Ben Jonson]] wrote of \"Marlowe's mighty line\". [[Thomas Nashe]] wrote warmly of his friend, \"poor deceased Kit Marlowe\". So too did the publisher Edward Blount, in the dedication of ''Hero and Leander'' to Sir Thomas Walsingham.\n\nAmong the few contemporary dramatists to say anything negative about Marlowe was the anonymous author of the Cambridge University play ''[[Parnassus plays|The Return From Parnassus]]'' (1598) who wrote, \"Pity it is that wit so ill should dwell, / Wit lent from heaven, but vices sent from hell.\"\n\nThe most famous tribute to Marlowe was paid by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[As You Like It]]'', where he not only quotes a line from ''[[Hero and Leander (poem)|Hero and Leander]]'' (\"Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might, 'Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?{{'\"}})<ref>Peter Alexander ed., ''William Shakespeare: The Complete Works'' (London 1962) p. 273</ref> but also gives to the clown [[Touchstone (As You Like It)|Touchstone]] the words \"When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room.\" This appears to be a reference to Marlowe's murder which involved a fight over the \"reckoning\", the bill, as well as to a line in Marlowe's ''Jew of Malta''{{spaced ndash}}\"Infinite riches in a little room\".\n\nShakespeare was heavily influenced by Marlowe in his work, as can be seen in the re-using of Marlovian themes in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', and ''[[Macbeth]]'' (''Dido'', ''Jew of Malta'', ''Edward II'' and ''Doctor Faustus'', respectively). In ''[[Hamlet]]'', after meeting with the travelling actors, Hamlet requests the Player perform a speech about the Trojan War, which at 2.2.429\u201332 has an echo of Marlowe's ''[[Dido, Queen of Carthage (play)|Dido, Queen of Carthage]]''. In ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' Shakespeare brings on a character \"Marcade\" (three syllables) in conscious acknowledgement of Marlowe's character \"Mercury\", also attending the King of Navarre, in ''Massacre at Paris''. The significance, to those of Shakespeare's audience who had read ''Hero and Leander'', was Marlowe's identification of himself with the god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].<ref name=\"Jean-Christophe Mayer2008\">{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Wilson (scholar)|editor=Mayer, Jean-Christophe |title=Representing France and the French in early modern English drama|year=2008|publisher=University of Delaware Press|location=Newark, DE|isbn=0-87413-000-X|pages=95\u201397|chapter=Worthies away: the scene begins to cloud in Shakespeare's Navarre}}</ref>\n\n==As Shakespeare==\n{{Main|Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship|Shakespeare authorship question}}\nAn [[argument]] has arisen centred on the notion that Marlowe may have faked his death and then continued to write under the assumed name of William Shakespeare.

Physical or biological science is also an important goal for some cavers, while others are engaged in cave photography.<ref name=CHALL/> Virgin cave systems comprise some of the last unexplored regions on [[Earth]] and much effort is put into trying to locate, enter and survey them. In well-explored regions (such as most developed nations), the most accessible caves have already been explored, and gaining access to new caves often requires [[cave digging]] or cave diving.\n\nCaving, in certain areas, has also been utilized as a form of eco and adventure tourism. Tour companies have established an industry leading and guiding tours into and through caves. Depending on the type of cave and the type of tour, the experience could be adventure-based or ecological-based. In many areas (e.g. [[Bend, Oregon|America]], the oceanic islands of [[Cueva del Viento|Tenerife]], [http://cave.is/caves-in-iceland/leidarendi-cave/ Iceland] and [https://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/craterrimtour_tube.htm Hawaii]), there are tours led through lava tubes by a guiding service.\n\nCaving has also been described as an \"individualist's team sport\" by some,<ref name=CAVENZ/> as cavers can often make a trip without direct physical assistance from others but will generally go in a group for companionship or to provide emergency help if needed.

This group referred to themselves as ''spelunkers'', a term derived<ref>{{OEtymD|spelunk}}</ref> from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|sp\u0113lunca}}'' \"cave, cavern, den\",<ref>{{L&S|spelunca|ref}}</ref> itself from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c3\u03c0\u1fc6\u03bb\u03c5\u03b3\u03be}} ''sp\u0113lynks'' \"cave\".<ref>{{LSJ|sph{{=}}lugc|\u03c3\u03c0\u1fc6\u03bb\u03c5\u03b3\u03be|ref}}.</ref> This is regarded as the first use of the word in the [[Americas]]. Throughout the 1950s, ''spelunking'' was the general term used for exploring caves in [[American English|US English]]. It was used freely, without any positive or negative connotations, although only rarely outside the US.\n\nIn the 1960s, the terms ''spelunking'' and ''spelunker'' began to be considered [[wiktionary:d\u00e9class\u00e9|d\u00e9class\u00e9]] among experienced enthusiasts. In 1985, Steve Knutson&nbsp;\u2013 editor of the [[National Speleological Society]] (NSS) publication ''American Caving Accidents''&nbsp;\u2013 made the following distinction:\n\n{{quote|\u2026Note that I use the term 'spelunker' to denote someone untrained and unknowledgeable in current exploration techniques, and 'caver' for those who are.}}\n\nThis sentiment is exemplified by [[bumper sticker]]s and T-shirts displayed by some cavers: \"Cavers rescue spelunkers\". Nevertheless, outside the caving community, \"spelunking\" and \"spelunkers\" predominately remain neutral terms referring to the practice and practitioners, without any respect to skill level.\n\n''Potholing'' refers to the act of exploring ''potholes'', a word originating in the north of [[England]] for predominantly [[vertical caving|vertical caves]].\n\nThe base term ''caving'' comes from the Latin ''cavea'' or ''caverna'', meaning simply, a cave.\n\n== History ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nCaving was pioneered by [[\u00c9douard-Alfred Martel]] (1859\u20131938), who first achieved the descent and exploration of the [[Gouffre de Padirac]], in France, as early as 1889 and the first complete descent of a 110-metre wet vertical shaft at [[Gaping Gill]], in [[Yorkshire]], England, in 1895. He developed his own techniques based on ropes and metallic ladders. Martel visited [[Kentucky]] and notably [[Mammoth Cave National Park]] in October 1912. In the 1920s famous US caver [[Floyd Collins]] made important explorations in the area and in the 1930s, as caving became increasingly popular, small exploration teams both in the [[Alps]] and in the karstic high plateaus of southwest France ([[Causses]] and [[Pyrenees]]) transformed cave exploration into both a scientific and recreational activity. [[Robert de Joly]],  [[Guy de Lavaur]]  and [[Norbert Casteret]] were prominent figures of that time, surveying mostly caves in Southwest France.  During [[World War II]], an alpine team composed of [[Pierre Chevalier (caver)|Pierre Chevalier]], [[Fernand Petzl]], Charles Petit-Didier and others explored the [[Dent de Crolles]] cave system near [[Grenoble]], which became the deepest explored system in the world (-658m) at that time. The lack of available equipment during the war forced Pierre Chevalier and the rest of the team to develop their own equipment, leading to technical innovation. The scaling-pole (1940), nylon ropes (1942), use of explosives in caves (1947) and mechanical rope-ascenders (Henri Brenot's \"monkeys\", first used by Chevalier and Brenot in a cave in 1934) can be directly associated to the exploration of the Dent de Crolles cave system.\n\nIn 1941, American cavers organized themselves into the [[National Speleological Society]] (NSS) to advance the exploration, conservation, study and understanding of caves in the United States. American caver [[Bill Cuddington]], known as \"Vertical Bill\", further developed the [[single-rope technique]] (SRT) in the late 1950s. In 1958, two Swiss alpinists, Juesi and Marti teamed together, creating the first rope ascender known as the [[Jumar]]. In 1968 Bruno Dressler asked Fernand Petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the [[Petzl Croll]], that he had developed by adapting the Jumar to pit caving. Pursuing these developments, Petzl started in the 1970s a caving equipment manufacturing company named [[Petzl]].  The development of the [[rappel rack]] and the evolution of mechanical ascension systems extended the practice and safety of pit exploration to a wider range of cavers.\n\n== Practice and equipment ==\n{{Main|Caving equipment}}\n[[Image:caving1.jpg|thumb|Caver in an [[Alabama]] cave showing common caving wear: coveralls, helmet-mounted lights, heavy boots and gloves.]]\n\n[[Hard hat]]s are worn to protect the head from bumps and falling rocks. The caver's primary light source is usually mounted on the helmet in order to keep the hands free. Electric [[LED]] lights are most common. Many cavers carry two or more sources of light \u2013 one as primary and the others as backup in case the first fails.  More often than not, a second light will be mounted to the helmet for quick transition if the primary fails. [[Carbide lamp]] systems are an older form of illumination, inspired by miner's equipment, and are still used by some cavers, particularly on remote expeditions where electric charging facilities are not available.<ref>[http://www.teara.govt.nz/TheBush/BushAndMountainRecreation/Caving/4/en Caving equipment and culture] (from [[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]])</ref>\n\nThe type of [[clothes]] worn underground varies according to the environment of the cave being explored, and the local culture. In cold caves, the caver may wear a warm base layer that retains its insulating properties when wet, such as a [[Wool|fleece]] (\"furry\") suit or polypropylene underwear, and an oversuit of hard-wearing (e.g., [[cordura]]) or waterproof (e.g., [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]) material. Lighter clothing may be worn in warm caves, particularly if the cave is dry, and in tropical caves thin polypropylene clothing is used, to provide some abrasion protection while remaining as cool as possible. [[Wetsuit]]s may be worn if the cave is particularly wet or involves stream passages.  On the feet [[boot]]s are worn&nbsp;\u2013 hiking-style boots in drier caves, or rubber boots (such as [[wellies]]) often with [[neoprene]] socks (\"wetsocks\") in wetter caves. [[Knee]]-pads (and sometimes [[Elbow-joint|elbow]]-pads) are popular for protecting joints during crawls. Depending on the nature of the cave, gloves are sometimes worn to protect the hands against abrasion or cold.  In pristine areas and for restoration, clean oversuits and powder-free, non-latex [[Medical gloves|surgical gloves]] are used to protect the cave itself from contaminants.\nRopes are used for descending or ascending pitches (single rope technique or SRT) or for protection. [[Knot]]s commonly used in caving are the [[figure-of-eight loop|figure-of-eight]]- (or [[figure-of-nine loop|figure-of-nine]]-) loop, [[bowline]], [[alpine butterfly knot|alpine butterfly]], and [[Italian hitch]]. Ropes are usually rigged using [[bolt (climbing)|bolts]], [[sling (climbing equipment)|sling]]s, and [[carabiner]]s. In some cases cavers may choose to bring and use a flexible metal [[ladder]].\n\nIn addition to the equipment already described, cavers frequently carry packs containing [[First aid|first-aid]] kits, emergency equipment, and food. Containers for securely transporting [[urine]] are also commonly carried{{fact?|date=July 2018}}.  On longer trips, containers for securely transporting [[feces]] out of the cave are carried{{fact?|date=July 2018}}.\n\nDuring very long trips, it may be necessary to camp in the cave&nbsp;\u2013 some cavers have stayed underground for many days, or in particularly extreme cases, for weeks at a time. This is particularly the case when exploring or mapping very extended cave systems, where it would be impractical to retrace the route back to the surface regularly. Such long trips necessitate the cavers carrying provisions, sleeping and cooking equipment.\n\n== Safety ==\n[[Image:Caving3.jpg|thumb|right|A caver begins rope descent of a vertical shaft using an abseil rack.]]\n{{See also|Cave rescue}}\nCaves can be dangerous places; hypothermia, [[falling (accident)|falling]], [[flooding]], falling rocks and physical [[Fatigue (medical)|exhaustion]] are the main risks. Rescuing people from underground is difficult and time-consuming, and requires special skills, training, and equipment. Full-scale cave rescues often involve the efforts of dozens of rescue workers (often other long-time cavers who have participated in specialized courses, as normal rescue staff are not sufficiently experienced in cave environments), who may themselves be put in jeopardy in effecting the rescue. This said, caving is not necessarily a high-risk sport (especially if it does not involve difficult climbs or diving). As in all physical sports, knowing one's limitations is key.\n\nCaving in warmer climates carries the risk of contracting [[histoplasmosis]], a fungal infection that is contracted from bird or bat droppings. It can cause [[pneumonia]] and can disseminate in the body to cause continued infections.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stenn|first1=Frederick|title=Cave Disease or Speleonosis|journal=American Medical Association Internal Medicine|date=1960|volume=105|issue=2|pages=181\u2013183}}</ref>\n\nIn many parts of the world, [[leptospirosis]] (\"a type of bacterial infection spread by animals\" including rats<ref>Leptospirosis is a type of bacterial infection spread by animals. It's caused by a strain of bacteria called leptospira.  In 90% of cases, leptospirosis only causes mild flu-like symptoms, such as a headache, chills and muscle pain.  However, in some cases the infection is more severe and can cause life-threatening problems, including organ failure and internal bleeding. In its most severe form, leptospirosis is also known as Weil's disease. http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/leptospirosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx</ref>) is a distinct threat due to the presence of rat urine in rainwater or precipitation that enters the caves water system. Complications are uncommon, but can be serious.\nSafety risks while caving can be minimized by using a number of techniques:\n\n* Checking that there is no danger of flooding during the expedition. Rainwater funneled underground can flood a cave very quickly, trapping people in cut-off passages and [[drowning]] them. In the UK, drowning accounts for over half of all caving fatalities (see [[List of UK caving fatalities]]).\n* Using teams of several cavers, preferably at least four. If an injury occurs, one caver stays with the injured person while the other two go out for help, providing assistance to each other on their way out.\n* Notifying people outside the cave as to the intended return time. After an appropriate delay without a return, these will then organize a search party (usually made up by other cavers trained in [[cave rescue]]s, as even professional emergency personnel are unlikely to have the skills to effect a rescue in difficult conditions).\n* Use of helmet-mounted lights (hands-free) with extra batteries. American cavers recommend a minimum of three independent sources of light per person,<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Responsible Caving|last=|first=|publisher=National Speleological Society|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=11|quote=|via=https://caves.org/brochure/Guide_to_Resp_Caving_2016.pdf}}</ref> but two lights is common practice among European cavers.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} \n* Sturdy clothing and footwear, as well as a [[helmet]], are necessary to reduce the impact of abrasions, falls, and falling objects. Synthetic fibers and woolens, which dry quickly, shed water, and are warm when wet, are vastly preferred to cotton materials, which retain water and increase the risk of hypothermia. It is also helpful to have several layers of clothing, which can be shed (and stored in the pack) or added as needed. In watery cave passages, [[polypropylene]] thermal underwear or wetsuits may be required to avoid [[hypothermia]].\n* Cave passages look different from different directions. In long or complex caves, even experienced cavers can become lost. To reduce the risk of becoming lost, it is necessary to memorize the appearance of key navigational points in the cave as they are passed by the exploring party. Each member of a cave party shares responsibility for being able to remember the route out of the cave. In some caves it may be acceptable to mark a small number of key junctions with small stacks or \"cairns\" of rocks, or to leave a non-permanent mark such as high-visibility [[flagging (tape)|flagging tape]] tied to a projection.\n* [[Pit cave|Vertical caving]] uses ladders or single rope technique (SRT) to avoid the need for climbing passages that are too difficult. SRT however is a complex skill and requires proper training before use underground and needs well-maintained equipment. Some drops that are [[abseiling|abseiled]] down may be as deep as several hundred meters (for example [[Harwood Hole]]).\n\n==Cave conservation==\nMany cave environments are very fragile.  Many [[speleothem]]s can be damaged by even the slightest touch and some by impacts as slight as a breath. Research suggests that increased carbon dioxide levels can lead to \"a higher equilibrium concentration of calcium within the drip waters feeding the speleothems, and hence causes dissolution of existing features.\"<ref name=\"Baker 1998 165\u2013175\">{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=A.|author2=Genty, D.|title=Environmental pressures on conserving cave speleothems: effects of changing surface land use and increased cave tourism.|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|date=June 1998|volume=53|issue=2|pages=165\u2013175|doi=10.1006/jema.1998.0208}}</ref>  In 2008, researchers found evidence that respiration from cave visitors may generate elevated carbon dioxide concentrations in caves, leading to increased temperatures of up to 3&nbsp;\u00b0C and a dissolution of existing features.<ref name=\"Baker 1998 165\u2013175\"/>\n\nPollution is also of concern.  Since water that flows through a cave eventually comes out in streams and rivers, any pollution may ultimately end up in someone's drinking water, and can even seriously affect the surface environment, as well.  Even minor pollution such as dropping [[organic material]] can have a dramatic effect on the cave biota.\n\nCave-dwelling species are also very fragile, and often, a particular species found in a cave may live within that cave alone, and be found nowhere else in the world, such as [[Alabama cave shrimp]].  Cave-dwelling species are accustomed to a near-constant climate of temperature and humidity, and any disturbance can be disruptive to the species' life cycles. Though cave wildlife may not always be immediately visible, it is typically nonetheless present in most caves.\n\n[[Bat]]s are one such fragile species of cave-dwelling animal. Bats which [[hibernation|hibernate]] are most vulnerable during the winter season, when no food supply exists on the surface to replenish the bat's store of energy should it be awakened from hibernation. Bats which [[Bird migration|migrate]] are most sensitive during the summer months when they are raising their young.  For these reasons, visiting caves inhabited by hibernating bats is discouraged during cold months; and visiting caves inhabited by migratory bats is discouraged during the warmer months when they are most sensitive and vulnerable.  Due to an affliction affecting bats in the northeastern US known as [[white nose syndrome]] (WNS),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/white_nose.html|title=Page Redirect|author=Northeast Region Web Development Group|work=fws.gov}}</ref> the US Fish & Wildlife Service has called for a moratorium [http://www.caves.org/WNS/USFWS-WNS_cave_advisory_news_rls_2009-03-26_final-1.pdf] effective March 26, 2009, on caving activity in states known to have hibernacula (MD, NY, VT, NH, MA, CT, NJ, PA, VA, and WV) affected by WNS, as well as adjoining states.\n\nSome cave passages may be marked with flagging tape or other indicators to show biologically, aesthetically, or archaeologically sensitive areas. Marked paths may show ways around notably fragile areas such as a pristine floor of [[sand]] or [[silt]] which may be thousands of years old, dating from the last time water flowed through the cave. Such deposits may easily be spoiled forever by a single misplaced step. Active formations such as [[flowstone]] can be similarly marred with a muddy footprint or handprint, and ancient human artifacts, such as fiber products, may even crumble to dust under all but the most gentle touch.\n\nIn 1988, concerned that cave resources were becoming increasingly damaged through unregulated use, Congress enacted the [[Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988|Federal Cave Resources Protection Act]], giving land management agencies in the United States expanded authority to manage cave conservation on public land.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Iraola|first=Roberto|title=Statutory overview: The Federal Cave Resources Protection Act of 1988|journal=Fordham Environmental Law Review|date=October 2005|volume=17|pages=89\u2013271}}</ref>\n\nIn Europe there have been some [[360 Panorama|panoramic 360\u00b0]] records and [[Virtual reality|VR]] projects as a means of sharing interesting caves or quarries:<ref>{{cite news|title=Virtual Caving|url=http://www.jphd360.net/index.php/en/im360/im360-caving|access-date=2014-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622020210/http://www.jphd360.net/index.php/en/im360/im360-caving|archive-date=2014-06-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" style=\"border:1px solid #999; background-color:#FFFFFF\" class=\"wikitable\" \n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"\n!

Such caves form in rock that is soluble; most occur in [[limestone]], but they can also form in other rocks including [[chalk]], [[Dolostone|dolomite]], marble, salt, and [[gypsum]]. Rock is dissolved by natural acid in groundwater that seeps through [[Bed (geology)|bedding planes]], [[Fault (geology)|faults]], joints, and comparable features. Over time cracks enlarge to become caves and cave systems.\n\nThe largest and most abundant solutional caves are located in limestone. Limestone dissolves under the action of rainwater and groundwater charged with H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ([[carbonic acid]]) and naturally occurring [[organic acid]]s. The dissolution process produces a distinctive landform known as ''[[karst]]'', characterized by [[sinkhole]]s and underground drainage. Limestone caves are often adorned with [[calcium carbonate]] formations produced through slow precipitation. These include [[flowstone]]s, [[stalactite]]s, [[stalagmite]]s, [[helictite]]s, [[soda straw]]s and columns. These secondary mineral deposits in caves are called ''[[speleothem]]s''.\n\nThe portions of a solutional cave that are below the [[water table]] or the local level of the groundwater will be flooded.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amazingcaves.com/learn_formed.html |title=Learning about caves; how caves are formed |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |author=John Burcham |work=Journey into amazing caves |publisher=Project Underground |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503192150/http://www.amazingcaves.com/learn_formed.html |archivedate=May 3, 2009 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Lechuguilla Cave]] in [[New Mexico]] and nearby [[Carlsbad Cavern]] are now believed to be examples of another type of solutional cave. They were formed by H<sub>2</sub>S ([[hydrogen sulfide]]) gas rising from below, where reservoirs of oil give off sulfurous fumes. This gas mixes with groundwater and forms H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> ([[sulfuric acid]]). The acid then dissolves the limestone from below, rather than from above, by acidic water percolating from the surface.\n\n===Primary cave===\n<!--{{main|Primary cave}}-->\n[[File:hawaiian lava tube.jpg|thumb|300px|Exploring a [[lava tube]] in [[Hawaii]].]]\nCaves formed at the same time as the surrounding rock are called '''primary caves'''.\n\n[[Lava tube]]s are formed through [[Volcano|volcanic]] activity and are the most common primary caves. As [[lava]] flows downhill, its surface cools and solidifies. Hot liquid lava continues to flow under that crust, and if most of it flows out, a hollow tube remains. Examples of such caves can be found in the [[Canary Islands]], [[Jeju Province|Jeju-do]], the basaltic plains of [[Eastern Idaho]], and other places. [[Kazumura Cave]] near [[Hilo]], [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]] is a remarkably long and deep lava tube; it is {{convert|65.6|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}.\n\nLava caves include but are not limited to lava tubes. Other caves formed through volcanic activity include rift caves, lava mold caves, open vertical volcanic conduits, and inflationary caves.\n\n===Sea cave or littoral cave===\n{{Main|Sea cave}}\n[[File:Painted cave.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Painted Cave, a large [[sea cave]], [[Santa Cruz Island]], [[California]]]]\nSea caves are found along coasts around the world. A special case is littoral caves, which are formed by wave action in zones of weakness in sea cliffs. Often these weaknesses are faults, but they may also be dykes or bedding-plane contacts. Some wave-cut caves are now above sea level because of later uplift. Elsewhere, in places such as Thailand's [[Phang Nga Bay]], solutional caves have been flooded by the sea and are now subject to littoral erosion. Sea caves are generally around {{convert|5|to|50|m}} in length, but may exceed {{convert|300|m}}.\n\n===Corrasional cave or erosional cave===\n[[Image:Sodom Salt Cave 031712.JPG|300px|right|thumb|[[Halite|Salt]] cave in [[Mount Sodom]], [[Israel]].]]\nCorrasional or erosional caves are those that form entirely by erosion by flowing streams carrying rocks and other sediments. These can form in any type of rock, including hard rocks such as granite. Generally there must be some zone of weakness to guide the water, such as a fault or joint. A subtype of the erosional cave is the wind or aeolian cave, carved by wind-born sediments. Many caves formed initially by solutional processes often undergo a subsequent phase of erosional or vadose enlargement where active streams or rivers pass through them.\n\n===Glacier cave===\n{{Main|Glacier cave}}\n[[File:Big Four Glacier Ice cave.jpg|300px|right|thumb|[[Glacier cave]] in Big Four Glacier, [[Big Four Mountain]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[circa|ca.]] 1920]]\nGlacier caves are formed by melting ice and flowing water within and under glaciers.  The cavities are influenced by the [[Creep (deformation)|very slow flow]] of the ice, which tends to collapse the caves again. Glacier caves are sometimes misidentified as \"[[ice cave]]s\", though this latter term is properly reserved for bedrock caves that contain year-round ice formations.\n\n===Fracture cave===\nFracture caves are formed when layers of more soluble minerals, such as gypsum, dissolve out from between layers of less soluble rock. These rocks fracture and collapse in blocks of stone.\n\n===Talus cave===\nTalus caves are formed by the openings among large boulders that have fallen down into a random heap, often at the bases of cliffs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kolawole|first=F.|last2=Anifowose|first2=A.

They occur in many parts of the world, and often contain highly specialized and endemic fauna.\n\n==Physical patterns==\n*''Branchwork caves'' resemble surface dendritic stream patterns; they are made up of passages that join downstream as tributaries. Branchwork caves are the most common of cave patterns and are formed near [[sinkhole]]s where [[groundwater recharge]] occurs.

The distribution of documented cave systems is widely skewed toward countries where caving has been popular for many years (such as France, Italy, Australia, the UK, the United States, etc.). As a result, explored caves are found widely in Europe, Asia, North America and Oceania, but are sparse in South America, Africa, and Antarctica.\n\nThis is a rough generalization, as large expanses of North America and Asia contain no documented caves, whereas areas such as the [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]] and parts of [[Brazil]] contain many documented caves. As the world's expanses of soluble bedrock are researched by cavers, the distribution of documented caves is likely to shift. For example, China, despite containing around half the world's exposed limestone\u2014more than {{convert|1000000|km2}}\u2014has relatively few documented caves.\n\n==Records and superlatives==\n*The cave system with the '''greatest total length''' of surveyed passage is [[Mammoth Cave National Park|Mammoth Cave]] in [[Kentucky]], US, at {{convert|652|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NSS-GEO2\">[http://www.caverbob.com/wlong.htm World\u2019s Longest Caves List from The National Speleological Society]</ref>\n*The longest surveyed '''underwater cave''', and second longest overall, is [[Sistema Sac Actun]] in [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]], Mexico at {{convert|335|km|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NSS-GEO2\" />\n*The '''deepest known cave''' \u2014 measured from its highest entrance to its lowest point \u2014 is [[Veryovkina Cave]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], with a depth of {{convert|2,204|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=wdeep>[http://www.caverbob.com/wdeep.htm World's Deepest Caves List from The National Speleological Society]</ref> This was the first cave to be explored to a depth of more than {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}}.

Some authors use separate terminology for aquatic forms (for example, [[stygobite]]s, [[stygophile]]s, and [[stygoxene]]s).\n\nOf these animals, the troglobites are perhaps the most unusual organisms. Troglobitic species often show a number of characteristics, termed troglomorphic, associated with their adaptation to subterranean life. These characteristics may include a loss of pigment (often resulting in a pale or white coloration), a loss of eyes (or at least of optical functionality), an elongation of appendages, and an enhancement of other senses (such as the ability to sense vibrations in water). Aquatic troglobites (or stygobites), such as the endangered [[Alabama cave shrimp]], live in bodies of water found in caves and get nutrients from detritus washed into their caves and from the feces of bats and other cave inhabitants. Other aquatic troglobites include cave fish, and [[cave salamander]]s such as the [[olm]] and the [[Texas blind salamander]].\n\n[[Cave insects]] such as Oligaphorura (formerly Archaphorura) schoetti are troglophiles, reaching {{convert|1.7|mm}} in length. They have extensive distribution and have been studied fairly widely. Most specimens are female, but a male specimen was collected from [[St Cuthberts Swallet]] in 1969.\n\n[[Bat]]s, such as the [[gray bat]] and [[Mexican free-tailed bat]], are trogloxenes and are often found in caves; they forage outside of the caves. Some species of [[cave cricket]]s are classified as trogloxenes, because they roost in caves by day and forage above ground at night.\n\nBecause of the fragile nature of the cave ecosystem, and the fact that cave regions tend to be isolated from one another, caves harbor a number of endangered species, such as the [[Tooth cave spider]], [[Liphistiidae|liphistius trapdoor spider]], and the gray bat.\n\nCaves are visited by many surface-living animals, including humans. These are usually relatively short-lived incursions, due to the lack of light and sustenance.\n\nCave entrances often have typical florae. For instance, in the eastern temperate United States, cave entrances are most frequently (and often densely) populated by the bulblet fern, ''[[Cystopteris bulbifera]]''.\n\n==Archaeological and cultural importance==\n[[File:Taino petroglyph in cave.jpg|thumb|[[Ta\u00edno people|Ta\u00edno]] [[petroglyph]]s in a cave in Puerto Rico]]\nThroughout history, primitive peoples have made use of caves. The earliest human [[fossil]]s found in caves come from a series of caves near Krugersdorp and Mokopane in South Africa. The cave sites of [[Sterkfontein]], [[Swartkrans]], [[Kromdraai]] B, [[Drimolen]], [[Malapa]], Cooper's D, Gladysvale, Gondolin and Makapansgat have yielded a range of early human species dating back to between three and one million years ago, including [[Australopithecus africanus]], [[Australopithecus sediba]] and [[Paranthropus robustus]]. However, it is not generally thought that these early humans were living in the caves, but that they were brought into the caves by carnivores that had killed them.\n\nThe first early hominid ever found in Africa, the [[Taung Child]] in 1924, was also thought for many years to come from a cave, where it had been deposited after being predated on by an eagle. However, this is now debated (Hopley et al., 2013; Am. J. Phys. Anthrop.). Caves do form in the dolomite of the Ghaap Plateau, including the Early, Middle and Later Stone Age site of [[Wonderwerk Cave]]; however, the caves that form along the escarpment's edge, like that hypothesised for the Taung Child, are formed within a secondary limestone deposit called [[tufa]]. There is numerous evidence for other early human species inhabiting caves from at least one million years ago in different parts of the world, including [[Homo erectus]] in China at [[Zhoukoudian]], [[Homo rhodesiensis]] in South Africa at the Cave of Hearths ([[Makapansgat]]), [[Homo neandertalensis]] and [[Homo heidelbergensis]] in Europe at [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca]], [[Homo floresiensis]] in Indonesia, and the [[Denisovans]] in southern Siberia.\n\nIn southern Africa, early modern humans regularly used sea caves as shelter starting about 180,000 years ago when they learned to exploit the sea for the first time (Marean et al., 2007; Nature). The oldest known site is PP13B at [[Pinnacle Point]]. This may have allowed rapid expansion of humans out of Africa and colonization of areas of the world such as Australia by 60-50,000 years ago. Throughout southern Africa, Australia, and Europe, early modern humans used caves and rock shelters as sites for rock art, such as those at [[Giants Castle]]. Caves such as the [[yaodong]] in China were used for shelter; other caves were used for burials (such as [[rock-cut tombs]]), or as religious sites (such as [[:Category:Buddhist caves|Buddhist caves]]).

The more familiar indigenous system is based on [[Chinese character]]s that correspond to [[Numeral (linguistics)|numerals in the spoken language]]. These are shared with other languages of the [[Chinese cultural sphere]] such as Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese. Most people and institutions in China and Taiwan primarily use the Arabic or mixed Arabic-Chinese systems for convenience, with traditional Chinese numerals used in finance, mainly for writing amounts on checks, banknotes, some ceremonial occasions, some boxes, and on commercials.\n{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nThe other indigenous system is the [[Suzhou numerals]], or ''huama'', a positional system, the only surviving form of the [[rod numerals]]. These were once used by Chinese mathematicians, and later in Chinese markets, such as those in [[Hong Kong]] before the 1990s, but have been gradually supplanted by Arabic (and also [[Roman numerals|Roman]]) numerals.\n\n==Characters used to represent numbers==\n[[File:Muyu-G209-1620km-5469-crop.jpg|thumb|Chinese and Arabic numerals may coexist, as on this kilometer marker: {{convert|1620|km|abbr=on}} on [[China National Highway 209|Hwy G209]] (G\u4e8c\u3007\u4e5d)]]\nThe Chinese character numeral system consists of the [[Chinese characters]] used by the [[Chinese written language]] to write spoken numerals. Similar to spelling-out numbers in English (e.g., \"one thousand nine hundred forty-five\"), it is not an independent system ''per se''. Since it reflects spoken language, it does not use the positional system as in [[Arabic numerals]], in the same way that spelling out numbers in English does not.\n\n=== Standard numbers ===\nThere are characters representing the numbers zero through nine, and other characters representing larger numbers such as tens, hundreds, thousands and so on. There are two sets of characters for Chinese numerals: one for everyday writing, known as ''xi\u01ceoxi\u011b'' ({{zh|t=\u5c0f\u5beb|s=\u5c0f\u5199|l=small writing, i.e. [[lower case]]}}), and one for use in commercial or financial contexts, known as ''d\u00e0xi\u011b'' ({{zh|t=\u5927\u5beb|s=\u5927\u5199|l=big writing, i.e. [[upper case]]}}). The latter arose because the characters used for writing numerals are geometrically simple, so simply using those numerals cannot prevent forgeries in the same way spelling numbers out in English would.<ref>[http://big5.hwjyw.com/zyzx/jxsc/hy/200912/t20091215_34515.shtml \u5927\u5beb\u6578\u5b57\u300e] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722183729/http://big5.hwjyw.com/zyzx/jxsc/hy/200912/t20091215_34515.shtml |date=2011-07-22 }}</ref> A forger could easily change the everyday characters <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u4e09\u5341|\u4e09\u5341]]</span> (30) to <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u4e94\u5343|\u4e94\u5343]]</span> (5000) just by adding a few strokes.

Whole numbers ===\nMultiple-digit numbers are constructed using a multiplicative principle; first the digit itself (from 1 to 9), then the place (such as 10 or 100); then the next digit.\n\nIn Mandarin, the multiplier <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u5169|\u5169]]</span> (li\u01ceng) is often used rather than <span class=\"nounderlines\">[[wikt:\u4e8c|\u4e8c]]</span> (\u00e8r) for all numbers 200 and greater with the \"2\" numeral (although as noted earlier this varies from dialect to dialect and person to person). Use of both \u5169 (li\u01ceng) or \u4e8c (\u00e8r) are acceptable for the number 200. When writing in the Cantonese dialect, \u4e8c (yi<sup>6</sup>) is used to represent the \"2\" numeral for all numbers.  In the [[Min Nan|southern Min]] dialect of Chaozhou ([[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), \u5169 (no<sup>6</sup>) is used to represent the \"2\" numeral in all numbers from 200 onwards.

For example, \"three people\" is expressed as \u4e09\u4e2a\u4eba ''s\u0101n ge r\u00e9n'', \"three GE person\", where \u4e2a ''ge'' is a classifier. There exist many [[List of Chinese classifiers|different classifiers]], for use with different sets of nouns, although \u4e2a is the most common, and may be used informally in place of other classifiers.\n\nChinese uses cardinal numbers in certain situations in which English would use ordinals. For example, \u4e09\u697c ''s\u0101n l\u00f3u'' (literally \"three story\") means \"third floor\" (\"second floor\" in British numbering). Likewise, \u4e8c\u5341\u4e00\u4e16\u7eaa ''\u00e8rsh\u00ed y\u012b sh\u00ecj\u00ec'' (literally \"twenty-one century\") is used for \"21st century\".<ref>Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 12.</ref>\n\nNumbers of years are commonly spoken as a sequence of digits, as in \u4e8c\u96f6\u96f6\u4e00 ''\u00e8r l\u00edng l\u00edng y\u012b'' (\"two zero zero one\") for the year 2001.<ref>Yip, Po-Ching; Rimmington, Don, ''Chinese: A Comprehensive Grammar'', Routledge, 2004, p. 13.</ref> Names of months and days (in the Western system) are also expressed using numbers: \u4e00\u6708 ''y\u012byu\u00e8'' (\"one month\") for January, etc.; and \u661f\u671f\u4e00 ''x\u012bngq\u012by\u012b'' (\"week one\") for Monday, etc. Only one exception, Sunday is \u661f\u671f\u65e5 ''x\u012bngq\u012br\u00ec'', or informally \u661f\u671f\u5929 ''x\u012bngq\u012bti\u0101n'', literally \"week day\". When meaning \"week\", \"\u661f\u671f\" ''x\u012bngq\u012b'' and \"\u79ae\u62dc\" ''l\u01d0b\u00e0i'' are interchangeable.

For brevity the ''ni\u00e1n'', ''yu\u00e8'' and ''r\u00ec'' may be dropped to give a date composed of just numbers, so for example 64, in Chinese is six-four, short for month six-day four i.e. June Fourth, a common Chinese shorthand for the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].\n\n== Counting rod and Suzhou numerals ==\n[[File:Chounumerals.svg|thumb|right|150px|Counting rod numerals]]\n{{Main|Suzhou numerals}}\n\nIn the same way that [[Roman numerals]] were standard in ancient and medieval Europe for mathematics and commerce, the Chinese formerly used the [[counting rods|rod numerals]], which is a positional system.

After being introduced to the rod numerals, he said \"Having thus obtained a simple but effective system of figures, we find the Chinese in actual use of a method of notation depending on the theory of local value [i.e. place-value], several centuries before such theory was understood in Europe, and while yet the science of numbers had scarcely dawned among the Arabs.\"<ref>Alexander Wylie, ''Jottings on the Sciences of the Chinese, North Chinese Herald, 1853, Shanghai''</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties (after Arabic numerals were introduced into China), some Chinese mathematicians used Chinese numeral characters as positional system digits. After the Qing period, both the Chinese numeral characters and the Suzhou numerals were replaced by Arabic numerals in mathematical writings.\n\n== Cultural influences ==\n\nTraditional Chinese numeric characters are also used in [[Japan]] and [[Korea]] and were used in [[Vietnam]] before the 20th century. In vertical text (that is, read top to bottom), using characters for numbers is the norm, while in horizontal text, Arabic numerals are most common. Chinese numeric characters are also used in much the same formal or decorative fashion that Roman numerals are in Western cultures.

Editing source code involves testing, analyzing, refining, and sometimes coordinating with other programmers on a jointly developed program. A person who practices this skill is referred to as a computer [[programmer]], software developer, and sometimes coder.\n\nThe sometimes lengthy process of computer programming is usually referred to as [[software development]]. The term [[software engineering]] is becoming popular as the process is seen as an [[engineering]] discipline.\n\n===Programming languages===\n{{main|Programming language}}\n[[File:Object-Oriented-Programming-Methods-And-Classes-with-Inheritance.png|thumb|A computer program written in the imperative programming style]]\n\nComputer programs can be categorized by the [[programming language]] [[programming paradigm|paradigm]] used to produce them. Two of the main paradigms are [[imperative programming|imperative]] and [[declarative language|declarative]].\n\n====Imperative languages====\n''Imperative programming languages'' specify a sequential [[algorithm#Computer algorithm|algorithm]] using declarations, expressions, and statements:<ref name=\"cpl-ch4-75\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 75\n  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3\n}}</ref>\n* A ''declaration'' couples a [[variable (programming)|variable]] name to a [[datatype]] \u2013 for example: <code> var x: integer; </code>\n* An ''expression'' yields a value \u2013 for example: <code> 2 + 2 </code> yields 4\n* A ''statement'' might assign an expression to a variable or use the value of a variable to alter the program's [[control flow]] \u2013 for example: <code>x := 2 + 2; if x = 4 then do_something();</code>\n\nOne criticism of imperative languages is the side effect of an assignment statement on a class of variables called non-local variables.<ref name=\"cpl-ch9-213\" />\n\n====Declarative languages====\n''Declarative programming languages'' describe ''what'' computation should be performed and not ''how'' to compute it. Declarative programs omit the [[control flow]] and are considered ''sets'' of instructions. Two broad categories of declarative languages are [[functional language]]s and [[logical language]]s. The principle behind functional languages (like [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]) is to not allow [[side effect (computer science)|side effects]], which makes it easier to reason about programs like mathematical functions.<ref name=\"cpl-ch9-213\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 213\n  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3\n}}</ref> The principle behind logical languages (like [[Prolog]]) is to define the problem to be solved&nbsp;\u2013 the goal&nbsp;\u2013 and leave the detailed solution to the Prolog system itself.<ref name=\"cpl-ch10-244\">{{cite book\n  | last = Wilson\n  | first = Leslie B.\n  | title = Comparative   Programming Languages, Second Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1993\n  | page = 244\n  | isbn = 0-201-56885-3\n}}</ref> The goal is defined by providing a list of subgoals. Then each subgoal is defined by further providing a list of its subgoals, etc. If a path of subgoals fails to find a solution, then that subgoal is [[backtracking|backtracked]] and another path is systematically attempted.\n\n===Compilation and interpretation===\nA computer program in the form of a [[human-readable]], computer programming language is called [[source code]]. Source code may be converted into an [[Executable file|executable image]] by a [[compiler]] or [[execution (computing)|executed]] immediately with the aid of an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]].\n\nCompilers are used to translate source code from a programming language into either [[Object file|object code]] or [[machine code]].<ref>{{cite web|title=What is a Compiler?|url=http://lambda.uta.edu/cse5317/notes/node3.html|accessdate=2012-01-10}}</ref>  Object code needs further processing to become machine code, and machine code consists of the [[central processing unit|central processing unit's]] native instructions, ready for execution. Compiled computer programs are commonly referred to as executables, binary images, or simply as [[Binary file|binaries]]&nbsp;\u2013 a reference to the [[Binary numeral system|binary]] [[file format]] used to store the executable code.\n\nInterpreters are used to execute source code from a programming language line-by-line. The interpreter [[Parsing|decodes]] each [[Statement (computer science)|statement]] and performs its behavior. One advantage of interpreters is that they can easily be extended to an [[REPL|interactive session]]. The programmer is presented with a prompt, and individual lines of code are typed in and performed immediately.\n\nThe main disadvantage of interpreters is computer programs run slower than when compiled. Interpreting code is slower because the interpreter must decode each statement and then perform it. However, software development may be faster using an interpreter because testing is immediate when the compiling step is omitted. Another disadvantage of interpreters is an interpreter must be present on the executing computer. By contrast, compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution.\n\n[[just-in-time compilation|Just in time compilers]] pre-compile computer programs just before execution. For example, the Java [[virtual machine#Process virtual machines|virtual machine]] Hotspot contains a Just In Time Compiler which selectively compiles Java bytecode into machine code - but only code which Hotspot predicts is likely to be used many times.\n\nEither compiled or interpreted programs might be executed in a [[batch processing|batch process]] without human interaction.\n\n[[Scripting language]]s are often used to create batch processes. One common scripting language is [[Unix shell]], and its executing environment is called the [[command-line interface]].\n\nNo properties of a programming language require it to be exclusively compiled or exclusively interpreted. The categorization usually reflects the most popular method of language execution. For example, Java is thought of as an interpreted language and C a compiled language, despite the existence of Java compilers and C interpreters.\n\n==Storage and execution==\n[[File:Papertape3.jpg|thumb|In the 1950s, computer programs were stored on [[Punched tape|perforated paper tape]] ]]\n\nTypically, computer programs are stored in [[non-volatile memory]] until requested either directly or indirectly to be [[execution (computing)|executed]] by the computer user. Upon such a request, the program is loaded into [[random-access memory]], by a computer program called an [[operating system]], where it can be accessed directly by the central processor. The central processor then executes (\"runs\") the program, instruction by instruction, until termination. A program in execution is called a [[process (computing)|process]].<ref name=\"osc-ch4-97\">{{cite book\n  | last = Silberschatz\n  | first = Abraham\n  | title = Operating System Concepts, Fourth Edition\n  | publisher = Addison-Wesley\n  | year = 1994\n  | page = 97\n  | isbn = 0-201-50480-4\n}}</ref> Termination is either by normal self-termination or by error&nbsp;\u2013 software or hardware error.\n\n===Simultaneous execution===\n{{See also|Process (computing)|Multiprocessing}}\n\nMany operating systems support [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] which enables many computer programs to appear to run simultaneously on one computer.

[[Multithreading (computer architecture)|Multithreading]] processors are optimized to execute multiple threads efficiently, due to having more than one processor which can either be a [[Multi-core processor]] or a computer that has more than one CPU installed. These Multi-core processors will have multiple cores where each core is a processor that has it own set of threads. Multi-core processors are actually more energy efficient than a single core CPU, because multi-core processors have certain cores that are more energy efficient, which in turn with the ability to multitask and delegate tasks to different cores actually decreases the amount of energy used by the CPU. \n\nMost programming languages include a certain [[Library (computing)]] that allows programmers to now execute their code in parallel using multithreading. Once a program is properly parallelized by the programmer, its up to the user of the software's CPU to determine which cores and threads are used. After the user reaches a certain amount of cores in their CPU, [[Diminishing returns]] occurs where the increase in core count has very little if any effect to increasing the speed of the execution of the program, these diminishing returns can be measured by [[Amdahl's law]].\n\n===Self-modifying programs===\n{{Main|Self-modifying code}}\n\nA computer program in [[execution (computing)|execution]] is normally treated as being different from the [[Data (computing)|data]] the program operates on. However, in some cases, this distinction is blurred when a computer program modifies itself. The modified computer program is subsequently executed as part of the same program. [[Self-modifying code]] is possible for programs written in [[machine code]], [[assembly language]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[COBOL]], [[PL/1]], and [[Prolog]].\n\n==Functional categories==\nComputer programs may be categorized along functional lines.

Application software not designed for the end user includes [[middleware]], which couples one application with another. Application software also includes [[Utility software|utility programs]]. The distinction between system software and application software is under debate.\n\n===Application software===\n{{Main|Application software}}\n[[File:Gcalctool-scientific.png|thumb|Example of an app: [[GCalctool]], a software calculator]]\n\nThere are many types of application software:\n* The word '''app''' came to being in 21st century. It is a [[Clipping (morphology)|clipping]] of the word \"application\". They have been designed for many platforms, but the word was first used for smaller mobile apps. Desktop apps are traditional computer programs that run on [[desktop computer]]s. [[Mobile app]]s run on [[mobile device]]s. [[Web app]]s run inside a [[web browser]]. Both mobile and desktop apps may be downloaded from the developers' website or purchased from [[app store]]s such as [[Microsoft Store (digital)|Microsoft Store]], [[Apple App Store]], [[Mac App Store]], [[Google Play]] or [[Intel AppUp]].\n* An '''[[application suite]]''' consists of multiple applications bundled together. Examples include [[Microsoft Office]], [[LibreOffice]], and [[iWork]]. They bundle a word processor, spreadsheet, and other applications.\n* '''[[Enterprise software|Enterprise applications]]''' bundle accounting, personnel, customer, and vendor applications. Examples include [[enterprise resource planning]], [[customer relationship management]], and [[supply chain management software]].\n* '''Enterprise infrastructure software''' supports the enterprise's [[software systems]]. Examples include databases, email servers, and network servers.\n* '''[[Information worker]] software''' are designed for workers at the departmental level. Examples include [[time management]], [[schedule (workplace)|resource management]], analytical, collaborative and documentation tools. Word processors, spreadsheets, email and blog clients, personal information system, and individual media editors may aid in multiple information worker tasks.\n* '''Media development software''' generates print and electronic media for others to consume, most often in a commercial or educational setting. These produce graphics, publications, animations, and videos.\n* '''Product engineering software''' is used to help develop large machines and other application software. Examples includes [[computer-aided design]] (CAD), [[computer-aided engineering]] (CAE), and [[integrated development environment]]s.\n* '''Entertainment Software''' can refer to video games, movie recorders and players, and music recorders and players.\n\n===Utility programs===\n[[Utility software|Utility programs]] are application programs designed to aid [[system administrator]]s and [[computer programmer]]s.\n\n===Operating system===\n{{See also|Operating system}}\n\nAn [[operating system]] is a computer program that acts as an intermediary between a user of a computer and the computer hardware.\n<ref name=\"osc-overview\"/>\n\nIn the 1950s, the programmer, who was also the operator, would write a program and run it.<ref name=\"osc-ch1-p6\"/>\nAfter the program finished executing, the output may have been printed, or it may have been punched onto paper tape or cards for later processing.<ref name=\"osc-ch1-p6\"/>\nMore often than not the program did not work.\n<ref name=\"sco-ch1-p11\">{{cite book\n  | last = Tanenbaum\n  | first = Andrew S.\n  | title = Structured Computer Organization, Third Edition\n  | publisher = Prentice Hall\n  | year = 1990\n  | page = 11\n  | isbn = 0-13-854662-2\n}}</ref>\nThe programmer then looked at the console lights and fiddled with the console switches.

While many have a catalogue of crimes called the [[criminal code]], in some [[Common law (legal system)|common law]] countries no such comprehensive statute exists.\n\nThe state ([[Forms of government|government]]) has the power to severely restrict one's [[liberty]] for committing a crime. In [[Contemporary society|modern societies]], there are [[Criminal procedure|procedures]] to which investigations and [[trial]]s must adhere. If found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]], an offender may be [[Sentence (law)|sentenced]] to a form of reparation such as a [[community sentence]], or, depending on the nature of their offence, to undergo [[imprisonment]], [[life imprisonment]] or, in some [[jurisdiction]]s, [[Capital punishment|execution]].\n\nUsually, to be classified as a crime, the \"act of doing something criminal\" (''[[actus reus]]'') must{{snd}}with [[Strict liability|certain exceptions]]{{snd}}be accompanied by the \"intention to do something criminal\" (''[[mens rea]]'').<ref name=\"oxdic\"/>\n\nWhile every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. Breaches of [[private law]] ([[tort]]s and [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]]) are not automatically punished by the state, but can be enforced through [[civil procedure]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nWhen informal relationships and sanctions prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired [[social order]], a government or a [[state (polity)|state]] may impose more formalized or stricter systems of [[social control]]. With institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the [[State (polity)|State]] can compel [[population]]s to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.\n\nAuthorities employ various mechanisms to regulate (encouraging or discouraging) certain behaviors in general. Governing or administering agencies may for example codify rules into laws, police citizens and visitors to ensure that they comply with those laws, and implement other policies and practices that legislators or administrators have prescribed with the aim of discouraging or [[crime prevention|preventing crime]]. In addition, authorities provide [[Legal remedy|remedies]] and [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]], and collectively these constitute a [[criminal justice]] system. Legal sanctions vary widely in their severity; they may include (for example) incarceration of temporary character aimed at reforming the convict. Some jurisdictions have penal codes written to inflict permanent harsh punishments: legal [[mutilation]], [[capital punishment]] or [[life imprisonment|life without parole]].\n\nUsually, a [[natural person]] perpetrates a crime, but [[legal personality|legal persons]] may also commit crimes. Conversely, at least under U.S. law, nonpersons such as animals cannot commit crimes.<ref>''People v. Frazier'', [http://online.ceb.com/CalCases/CA4/173CA4t613.htm 173 Cal. App. 4th 613] (2009).

Originally the Latin word ''cr\u012bmen'' meant \"[[criminal charge|charge]]\" or \"cry of distress.\"<ref>Ernest Klein, [https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 ''Klein's Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322101740/http://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Etymological-Dictionary-English-Language/dp/0444409300 |date=2016-03-22 }}</ref> The [[Ancient Greek]] word ''krima'' (\u03ba\u03c1\u03af\u03bc\u03b1), from which the Latin cognate derives, typically referred to an intellectual mistake or an offense against the community, rather than a private or moral wrong.<ref>Bakaoukas, Michael. \"The conceptualisation of 'Crime' in Classical Greek Antiquity: From the ancient Greek 'crime' (krima) as an intellectual error to the christian 'crime' (crimen) as a moral sin.\" ERCES ( European and International research group on crime, Social Philosophy and Ethics). 2005. {{cite web |url=http://www.erces.com/journal/articles/archives/volume2/v02/v02.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928085421/http://www.erces.com/journal/articles/archives/volume2/v02/v02.htm |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn 13th century [[English language|English]] ''crime'' meant \"sinfulness\", according to [[online Etymology Dictionary|etymonline.com]]. It was probably brought to England as Old French ''crimne'' (12th century form of [[French language|Modern French]] ''crime''), from Latin ''crimen'' (in the genitive case: ''criminis''). In Latin, ''crimen'' could have signified any one of the following: \"[[Criminal charge|charge]], [[indictment]], [[Criminal accusation|accusation]]; crime, [[fault (legal)|fault]], offense\".\n\nThe word may derive from the Latin ''cernere'' \u2013 \"to decide, to sift\" (see [[crisis]], mapped on [[Kairos]] and [[Chronos]]). But [[Ernest Klein]] (citing [[Karl Brugmann]]) rejects this and suggests *cri-men, which originally would have meant \"cry of distress\". Thomas G. Tucker suggests a root in \"[[crying|cry]]\" words and refers to English [[plaintiff|plaint]], [[plaintiff]], and so on. The meaning \"offense punishable by law\" dates from the late 14th century. The Latin word is [[Gloss (annotation)|glossed]] in Old English by ''facen'', also \"deceit, fraud, treachery\", [cf. fake]. ''Crime wave'' is first attested in 1893 in [[American English]].\n\n== Definition ==\n\n=== England and Wales ===\n\nWhether a given act or omission constitutes a crime does not depend on the nature of that act or omission.

This approach considers the complex realities surrounding the concept of crime and seeks to understand how changing [[society|social]], [[politics|political]], [[psychology|psychological]], and [[economics|economic]] conditions may affect changing definitions of crime and the form of the legal, [[Police|law-enforcement]], and penal responses made by society.\n\nThese [[structuralism|structural]] realities remain fluid and often contentious. For example: as cultures change and the political environment shifts, societies may [[criminalisation|criminalise]] or [[decriminalisation|decriminalise]] certain behaviours, which directly affects the [[statistics|statistical]] [[crime rate]]s, influence the allocation of resources for the enforcement of laws, and (re-)influence the general [[public opinion]].\n\nSimilarly, changes in the collection and/or calculation of data on crime may affect the public perceptions of the extent of any given \"crime problem\". All such adjustments to [[crime statistics]], allied with the experience of people in their everyday lives, shape attitudes on the extent to which the State should use law or [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] to enforce or encourage any particular [[social norm]]. Behaviour can be controlled and influenced by a society in many ways without having to resort to the criminal justice system.\n\nIndeed, in those cases where no clear [[consensus]] exists on a given norm, the drafting of [[criminal law]] by the group in [[power (sociology)|power]] to prohibit the behaviour of another group may seem to some observers an improper limitation of the second group's [[Political freedom|freedom]], and the ordinary members of society have less respect for the law or laws in general{{snd}}whether the authorities actually enforce the disputed law or not.\n\n=== Other definitions ===\n\n[[Legislature]]s can pass laws (called [[Malum prohibitum|''mala prohibita'']]) that define crimes against social norms. These laws vary from time to time and from place to place: note variations in [[gambling]] laws, for example, and the prohibition or encouragement of [[duelling]] in history. Other crimes, called [[Malum in se|''mala in se'']], count as outlawed in almost all societies, ([[murder]], [[theft]] and [[rape]], for example).\n\n[[English criminal law]] and the related criminal law of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries can define offences that the courts alone have developed over the years, without any actual legislation: [[common law offence]]s. The courts used the concept of ''[[malum in se]]'' to develop various common law offences.<ref>''Canadian Law Dictionary'', John A. Yogis, Q.C., Barrons: 2003\n</ref>\n\n== Criminalization ==\n{{Main article| Criminalization}}\n[[File:Traitors heads on old london bridge.jpg|thumb|The spiked heads of executed criminals once adorned the gatehouse of the medieval [[London Bridge]].]]\nOne can view criminalization as a procedure deployed by society as a preemptive harm-reduction device, using the threat of punishment as a [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]] to anyone proposing to engage in the behavior causing harm. The State becomes involved because governing entities can become convinced that the costs of not criminalizing (through allowing the harms to continue unabated) outweigh the costs of criminalizing it (restricting individual [[liberty]], for example, to minimize harm to others).\n\nStates control the process of criminalization because:\n* Even if [[victimology|victims]] recognize their own role as victims, they may not have the resources to investigate and seek legal redress for the injuries suffered: the enforcers formally appointed by the State often have better access to expertise and resources.\n* The victims may only want compensation for the injuries suffered, while remaining indifferent to a possible desire for [[deterrence (psychology)|deterrence]].<ref>See Polinsky & Shavell (1997) on the fundamental divergence between the private and the social motivation for using the legal system.</ref>\n* Fear of [[retaliate|retaliation]] may deter victims or witnesses of crimes from taking any action. Even in policed societies, fear may inhibit from reporting incidents or from co-operating in a [[Trial (law)|trial]].\n* Victims, on their own, may lack the economies of scale that could allow them to administer a penal system, let alone to collect any fines levied by a court.<ref>See Polinsky (1980) on the enforcement of fines</ref> Garoupa & Klerman (2002) warn that a [[rent-seeking]] government has as its primary motivation to maximize revenue and so, if offenders have sufficient wealth, a rent-seeking government will act more aggressively than a [[social welfare function|social-welfare]]-maximizing government in enforcing laws against minor crimes (usually with a fixed penalty such as parking and routine traffic violations), but more laxly in enforcing laws against major crimes.\n* As a result of the crime, victims may die or become incapacitated.\n\n== Labelling theory ==\n{{further|Labeling theory#The \"criminal\"}}\n\nThe [[Labeling theory|label]] of \"crime\" and the accompanying [[social stigma]] normally confine their scope to those activities seen as injurious to the general population or to the State, including some that cause serious loss or damage to individuals. Those who apply the labels of \"crime\" or \"criminal\" intend to assert the [[hegemony]] of a dominant population, or to reflect a consensus of condemnation for the identified behavior and to justify any punishments prescribed by the State (in the event that [[due process|standard processing]] [[trial (law)|tries]] and [[conviction (law)|convicts]] an accused person of a crime).\n\n== Natural-law theory ==\n\nJustifying the State's use of [[coercion|force]] to coerce compliance with its laws has proven a consistent theoretical problem. One of the earliest justifications involved the theory of [[natural law]]. This posits that the nature of the world or of human beings underlies the standards of [[morality]] or constructs them. [[Thomas Aquinas]] wrote in the 13th century: \"the rule and measure of human acts is the [[reason]], which is the first principle of human acts\" (Aquinas, ST I-II, Q.90, A.I). He regarded people as by nature [[rationality|rational]] beings, concluding that it becomes morally appropriate that they should behave in a way that conforms to their rational nature. Thus, to be valid, any law must conform to natural law and coercing people to conform to that law is morally acceptable. In the 1760s [[William Blackstone]] (1979: 41) described the thesis:\n\n: \"This law of nature, being co-eval with mankind and dictated by God himself, is of course superior in obligation to any other. It is binding over all the globe, in all countries, and at all times: no human laws are of any validity, if contrary to this; and such of them as are valid derive all their force, and all their authority, mediately or immediately, from this original.\"\n\nBut [[John Austin (legal philosophy)|John Austin]] (1790\u20131859), an early [[Legal positivism|positivist]], applied [[utilitarianism]] in accepting the calculating nature of human beings and the existence of an objective morality. He denied that the legal validity of a norm depends on whether its content conforms to morality. Thus in Austinian terms a moral code can objectively determine what people ought to do, the law can embody whatever norms the legislature decrees to achieve social utility, but every individual remains free to choose what to do. Similarly, [[H. L. A. Hart|Hart]] (1961) saw the law as an aspect of [[sovereignty]], with lawmakers able to adopt any law as a means to a moral end.\n\nThus the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of a proposition of law simply involved internal [[logic]] and [[consistency]], and that the state's agents used state power with [[Social responsibility|responsibility]]. [[Ronald Dworkin]] (2005) rejects Hart's theory and proposes that all individuals should expect the equal respect and concern of those who govern them as a fundamental political right. He offers a theory of compliance overlaid by a theory of [[deference]] (the citizen's duty to obey the law) and a theory of enforcement, which identifies the legitimate goals of enforcement and punishment. Legislation must conform to a theory of legitimacy, which describes the circumstances under which a particular person or group is entitled to make law, and a theory of legislative justice, which describes the law they are entitled or obliged to make.\n\nIndeed, despite everything, the majority{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} of natural-law theorists have accepted the idea of enforcing the prevailing morality as a primary function of the law. This view entails the problem that it makes any moral criticism of the law impossible: if conformity with natural law forms a necessary condition for legal validity, all valid law must, by definition, count as morally just. Thus, on this line of reasoning, the legal validity of a norm necessarily entails its moral justice.{{Clarify|date=December 2009|reason=see talk page 'Natural-law theory P5'}}\n\nOne can solve this problem by granting some degree of [[moral relativism]] and accepting that norms may evolve over time and, therefore, one can criticize the continued enforcement of old laws in the light of the current norms. People may find such law acceptable, but the use of State power to coerce citizens to comply with that law lacks moral justification. More recent conceptions of the theory characterise crime as the violation of [[individual and group rights|individual rights]].\n\nSince society considers so many rights as natural (hence the term \"[[rights|right]]\") rather than man-made, what constitutes a crime also counts as natural, in contrast to laws (seen as man-made). [[Adam Smith]] illustrates this view, saying that a [[smuggling|smuggler]] would be an excellent citizen, \"...had not the laws of his country made that a crime which nature never meant to be so.\"\n\nNatural-law theory therefore distinguishes between \"criminality\" (which derives from human nature) and \"illegality\" (which originates with the interests of those in [[power (sociology)|power]]). Lawyers sometimes express the two concepts with the phrases ''[[malum in se]]'' and ''[[malum prohibitum]]'' respectively. They regard a \"crime ''malum in se''\" as inherently criminal; whereas a \"crime ''malum prohibitum''\" (the argument goes) counts as criminal only because the law has decreed it so.\n\nIt follows from this view that one can perform an illegal act without committing a crime, while a criminal act could be perfectly legal. Many [[age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers (such as Adam Smith and the American [[List of national founders|Founding Fathers]]) subscribed to this view to some extent, and it remains influential among so-called [[Liberalism#Classical and modern|classical liberals]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} and [[Libertarianism|libertarians]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n== History ==\nSome religious communities regard [[sin]] as a crime; some may even highlight the crime of sin very early in legendary or mythological accounts of origins{{snd}}note the tale of [[Adam and Eve]] and the theory of [[original sin]]. What one group considers a crime may cause or ignite war or conflict. However, the earliest known [[civilization]]s had codes of [[law]], containing both [[civil law (common law)|civil]] and penal rules mixed together, though not always in recorded form.\n\nThe [[Sumer]]ians produced the earliest surviving written codes.<ref>Oppenheim (1964)</ref> [[Urukagina]] (reigned {{Circa|2380 BC|2360 BC}}, [[short chronology timeline|short chronology]]) had an early code that has not survived; a later king, [[Ur-Nammu]], left the earliest extant written law system, the [[Code of Ur-Nammu]] ({{c.|lk=no|2100|2050 BC}}), which prescribed a formal system of penalties for specific cases in 57 articles. The Sumerians later issued other codes, including the \"code of [[Lipit-Ishtar]]\". This code, from the 20th century BCE, contains some fifty articles, and scholars have reconstructed it by comparing several sources. {{quote|The Sumerian was deeply conscious of his personal rights and resented any encroachment on them, whether by his King, his superior, or his equal.

''The Law Code of Manu''. New York: Oxford UP.</ref>\n\n[[Sir Henry Maine]] (1861) studied the ancient codes available in his day, and failed to find any criminal law in the \"modern\" sense of the word. While modern systems distinguish between offences against the \"State\" or \"community\", and offences against the \"individual\", the so-called penal law of ancient communities did not deal with \"crimes\" (Latin: ''crimina''), but with \"wrongs\" (Latin: ''delicta''). Thus the Hellenic laws<ref>Gagarin: 1986; and Garner: 1987</ref> treated all forms of [[theft]], [[assault]], [[rape]], and murder as private wrongs, and left action for enforcement up to the victims or their survivors. The earliest systems seem to have lacked formal courts.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] systematized law and applied their system across the [[Roman Empire]]. Again, the initial rules of [[Roman law]] regarded assaults as a matter of private compensation. The most significant Roman law concept involved ''dominion''.<ref>Daube: 1969</ref> The ''[[pater familias]]'' owned all the family and its property (including slaves); the ''pater'' enforced matters involving interference with any property. The ''Commentaries'' of [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]] (written between 130 and 180 AD) on the [[Twelve Tables]] treated ''furtum'' (in modern parlance: \"theft\") as a [[tort]].\n\nSimilarly, assault and violent [[robbery]] involved [[trespass]] as to the ''pater's'' property (so, for example, the rape of a slave could become the subject of compensation to the ''pater'' as having trespassed on his \"property\"), and breach of such laws created a ''vinculum juris'' (an obligation of law) that only the payment of monetary compensation (modern \"[[damages]]\") could discharge. Similarly, the consolidated [[Germanic law|Teutonic laws]] of the [[Germanic tribes]],<ref>Guterman: 1990</ref> included a complex system of monetary compensations for what courts would {{As of| 2008 | alt = now}} consider the complete{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} range of criminal offences against the person, from murder down.\n\nEven though Rome abandoned its [[Roman Britain|Britannic provinces]] around 400 AD, the Germanic mercenaries{{spaced ndash}}who had largely become instrumental in enforcing Roman rule in Britannia{{spaced ndash}}acquired ownership of land there and continued to use a mixture of Roman and Teutonic Law, with much written down under the early [[Anglo-Saxon kings]].<ref>Attenborough: 1963</ref> But only when a more centralized English monarchy emerged following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]], and when the kings of England attempted to assert power over the land and its peoples, did the modern concept emerge, namely of a crime not only as an offence against the \"individual\", but also as a wrong against the \"State\".<ref>\nKern: 1948; Blythe: 1992; and Pennington: 1993\n</ref>\n\nThis idea came from [[common law]], and the earliest conception of a criminal act involved events of such major significance that the \"State\" had to usurp the usual functions of the civil tribunals, and direct a special law or ''privilegium'' against the perpetrator. All the earliest English criminal trials involved wholly extraordinary and arbitrary courts without any settled law to apply, whereas the civil (delictual) law operated in a highly developed and consistent manner (except where a king wanted to raise money by selling a new form of [[writ]]). The development of the idea that the \"State\" dispenses [[justice]] in a court only emerges in parallel with or after the emergence of the concept of [[sovereignty]].\n\nIn continental Europe, Roman law persisted, but with a stronger influence from the Christian Church.<ref>Vinogradoff (1909); Tierney: 1964, 1979\n</ref>\nCoupled with the more diffuse political structure based on smaller feudal units, various legal traditions emerged, remaining more strongly rooted in Roman [[jurisprudence]], but modified to meet the prevailing [[political climate]].\n\nIn Scandinavia the effect of Roman law did not become apparent until the 17th century, and the courts grew out of the ''[[thing (assembly)|things]]''{{snd}}the assemblies of the people. The people decided the cases (usually with largest freeholders dominating). This system later gradually developed into a system with a royal judge nominating a number of the most esteemed men of the parish as his board, fulfilling the function of \"the people\" of yore.\n\nFrom the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] system onwards, the policy rationale for requiring the payment of monetary compensation for wrongs committed has involved the avoidance of [[feud]]ing between [[clan]]s and [[family|families]].<ref>\nThe concept of the ''pater familias'' acted as a unifying factor in extended kin groups, and the later practice of ''[[weregild|wergild]]'' functioned in this context.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n</ref>\nIf compensation could mollify families' feelings, this would help to keep the peace. On the other hand, the institution of oaths also played down the threat of [[endemic warfare|feudal warfare]]. Both in archaic Greece and in [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Scandinavia]], an accused person walked free if he could get a sufficient number of male relatives to swear him not guilty. (Compare the [[United Nations Security Council]], in which the [[veto]] power of the permanent members ensures that the organization does not become involved in crises where it could not enforce its decisions.)\n\nThese means of restraining private [[feud]]s did not always work, and sometimes prevented the fulfillment of justice. But in the earliest times the \"state\" did not always provide an independent policing force. Thus criminal law grew out of what 21st-century lawyers would call torts; and, in real terms, many acts and omissions classified as crimes actually overlap with civil-law concepts.\n\nThe development of [[sociology|sociological]] thought from the 19th century onwards prompted some fresh views on crime and criminality, and fostered the beginnings of [[criminology]] as a study of crime in society. [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]] noted a link between crime and [[creativity]]{{spaced ndash}}in ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' he asserted<!-- in what context? -->:{{Context inline|date=November 2016}} \"The best and brightest that man can acquire he must obtain by crime\". In the 20th century [[Michel Foucault]] in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' made a study of [[criminalization]] as a coercive method of state control.\n\n== Classification and categorisation ==\n{{Globalize|section|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Categorisation by type ===\n\nThe following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms of art:{{clarify|date=May 2016}}\n* [[Offence against the person]]<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">For example, by the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]]</ref>\n* [[Violent crime|Violent offence]]<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">For example, by section 31(1) of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1991]], and by the [[Criminal Justice Act 2003]]</ref>\n* [[Sex and the law|Sexual offence]]<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n* [[Property crime|Offence against property]]<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nResearchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:\n* [[Forgery]], [[personation]] and [[cheating (law)|cheating]]<ref>E.g.

Thus [[Fine (penalty)|fines]] and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or (in some jurisdictions) [[capital punishment]] reserved for the most serious.\n\n=== Common law ===\n\nUnder the common law of England, crimes were classified as either [[treason]], [[felony]] or [[misdemeanour]], with treason sometimes being included with the felonies. This system was based on the perceived seriousness of the offence. It is still used in the United States but the distinction between felony and misdemeanour is abolished in England and Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\n=== Classification by mode of trial ===\n\nThe following classes of offence are based on [[mode of trial]]:\n* [[Indictable-only offence]]\n* [[Indictable offence]]\n* [[Hybrid offence]], a.k.a. either-way offence in England and Wales\n* [[Summary offence]], a.k.a. [[summary offence|infraction]] in the US\n\n=== Classification by origin ===\n\nIn common law countries, crimes may be categorised into [[common law offences]] and [[statutory]] offences. In the US, Australia and Canada (in particular), they are divided into [[federal crime]]s and under state crimes.\n\n=== Other classifications ===\n* [[Arrestable offence]]\n\n=== U.S. classification ===\n[[File:Felony Sentences in State Courts.pdf|thumb|''Felony Sentences in State Courts'', study by the [[United States Department of Justice]].]]\nIn the United States since 1930, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has tabulated [[Uniform Crime Reports]] (UCR) annually from crime data submitted by [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] agencies across the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/ucr/ucr.htm |title=FBI: Uniform Crime Reports |publisher=Fbi.gov |accessdate=2013-02-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041024015252/https://www.fbi.gov//ucr/ucr.htm |archivedate=2004-10-24 |df= }}</ref>\nOfficials compile this data at the city, county, and [[U.S. state|state]] levels into the UCR. They classify violations of laws based on [[common law]] as Part I (index) crimes in UCR data. These are further categorized as violent or property crimes. Part I violent crimes include murder and criminal homicide (voluntary manslaughter), forcible rape, aggravated assault, and robbery; while Part I property crimes include burglary, arson, larceny/theft, and motor-vehicle theft. All other crimes count come under Part II.\n\nFor convenience, such lists usually include [[summary offense|infractions]] although, in the U.S., they may come into the sphere not of the criminal law, but rather of the [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]]. Compare [[tort]]feasance.\n\nBooking [[arrest]]s require detention for a time-frame ranging 1 to 24 hours.\n\n==Reports, studies and organizations==\nThere are several national and International organizations offering studies and statistics about global and local crime activity, such as [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], the United States of America Overseas Security Advisory Council ([[OSAC]]) safety report or national reports generated by the law-enforcement authorities of EU state member reported to the [[Europol]].\n\n== Offence in common law jurisdictions ==\n\nIn England and Wales, as well as in Hong Kong, the term \"offence\" means the same thing as, and is interchangeable with, the term \"[[Crime#England and Wales|crime]]\",<ref name=\"Law, Eleventh Edition 1982, page 3\"/> They are further split into:\n* [[Summary offence]]s\n* [[Indictable offence]]s\n\n== Causes and correlates of crime ==\n{{main article|Causes and correlates of crime}}\n\nMany different [[correlates of crime|causes and correlates of crime]] have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. They include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and behavioral factors. Controversial topics include [[media violence research]] and effects of [[gun politics]].\n\nEmotional state (both chronic and current) have a tremendous impact on individual thought processes and, as a result, can be linked to criminal activities. The positive psychology concept of Broaden and Build posits that cognitive functioning expands when an individual is in a good-feeling emotional state and contracts as emotional state declines.<ref>Fredrickson, B. L. (2005). Positive Emotions broaden the scope of attention and though-action repertoires. Cognition and Emotion, 19: 313-332.</ref> In positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be ascertained. The narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an alternative, but if they can't conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. Criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.<ref>Baumeister, R. F. (2012).

Socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individual's conscience. Activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include (for example) [[alcohol]] consumption ([[prohibition]]), [[abortion]] and [[stem cell|stem-cell]] research. In various historical and present-day societies, institutionalized religions have established systems of earthly justice that punish crimes against the divine will and against specific devotional, organizational and other rules under specific codes, such as Roman Catholic [[canon law]].\n\n== Military jurisdictions and states of emergency ==\n\nIn the [[military]] sphere, authorities can prosecute both regular crimes and specific acts (such as [[mutiny]] or [[desertion]]) under [[martial law|martial-law]] codes that either supplant or extend civil codes in times of (for example) war.\n\nMany constitutions contain provisions to curtail freedoms and criminalize otherwise tolerated behaviors under a [[state of emergency]] in the event of war, natural disaster or civil unrest.

He joined Throop's board of trustees in 1907, and soon began developing it and the whole of Pasadena into a major scientific and cultural destination. He engineered the appointment of [[James Augustin Brown Scherer|James A. B. Scherer]], a literary scholar untutored in science but a capable administrator and fund raiser, to Throop's presidency in 1908. Scherer persuaded retired businessman and trustee Charles W.

The board of trustees offered to turn Throop over to the state, but the presidents of [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California]] successfully lobbied to defeat the bill, which allowed Throop to develop as the only scientific research-oriented education institute in southern California, public or private, until the onset of the World War II necessitated the broader development of research-based science education.<ref name=\"The Dream Endures\">{{cite book|last=Starr|first=Kevin|title=The Dream Endures: California Enters the 1940s|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=1997|pages=74\u201377|chapter=Unto the Stars Themselves, Astronomy and the Pasadena Perspective|isbn=0-19-515797-4}}</ref> The promise of Throop attracted [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] [[Arthur Amos Noyes]] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] to develop the institution and assist in establishing it as a center for science and technology.\n\nWith the onset of World War I, Hale organized the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] to coordinate and support scientific work on military problems. While he supported the idea of federal appropriations for science, he took exception to a federal bill that would have funded engineering research at land-grant colleges, and instead sought to raise a $1 million national research fund entirely from private sources. To that end, as Hale wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'':\n\n<blockquote>Throop College of Technology, in Pasadena California has recently afforded a striking illustration of one way in which the Research Council can secure co-operation and advance scientific investigation. This institution, with its able investigators and excellent research laboratories, could be of great service in any broad scheme of cooperation.

On November 29, 1921, the trustees declared it to be the express policy of the Institute to pursue scientific research of the greatest importance and at the same time \"to continue to conduct thorough courses in engineering and pure science, basing the work of these courses on exceptionally strong instruction in the fundamental sciences of mathematics, physics, and chemistry; broadening and enriching the curriculum by a liberal amount of instruction in such subjects as English, history, and economics; and vitalizing all the work of the Institute by the infusion in generous measure of the spirit of research\".<ref name=\"Caltech Catalog\"/> In 1923, Millikan was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. In 1925, the school established a department of geology and hired [[William Bennett Munro]], then chairman of the division of History, Government, and Economics at [[Harvard University]], to create a division of [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s at Caltech. In 1928, a division of [[biology]] was established under the leadership of [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], the most distinguished biologist in the United States at the time, and discoverer of the role of genes and the [[chromosome]] in heredity. In 1930, [[Kerckhoff Marine Laboratory]] was established in Corona del Mar under the care of Professor George MacGinitie. In 1926, a graduate school of [[aeronautics]] was created, which eventually attracted [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]]. K\u00e1rm\u00e1n later helped create the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and played an integral part in establishing Caltech as one of the world's centers for [[rocket|rocket science]].

This yearly event involves a crowd of observers, who try to spot the elusive spark. The title of the event is an oblique reference to the famous [[oil-drop experiment|Millikan oil-drop experiment]] which measured ''e'', the [[elementary charge|elemental unit of electrical charge]].\n\nOn Ditch Day, the seniors ditch school, leaving behind elaborately designed tasks and traps at the doors of their rooms to prevent underclassmen from entering. Over the years this has evolved to the point where many seniors spend months designing mechanical, electrical, and software obstacles to confound the underclassmen. Each group of seniors designs a \"stack\" to be solved by a handful of underclassmen. The faculty have been drawn into the event as well, and cancel all classes on Ditch Day so the underclassmen can participate in what has become a highlight of the academic year.\n\nAnother long-standing tradition is the playing of Wagner's \"[[Ride of the Valkyries]]\" at 7:00 each morning during finals week with the largest, loudest speakers available. The playing of that piece is not allowed at any other time (except if one happens to be listening to the entire 14 hours and 5 minutes of ''[[The Ring Cycle]]''), and any offender is dragged into the showers to be drenched in cold water fully dressed. \n{{clear}}\n\n==== Pranks ====\n[[File:Fleming cannon firing.jpg|thumb|The Fleming cannon]]\n\nCaltech students have been known for the many [[Student prank|prank]]s (also known as \"RFs\").<ref name=\"Caltech1\">{{cite news|last=Hiszpanski|first=Anna|title=Fleming Cannon Gone|url=http://caltechcampuspubs.library.caltech.edu/1976/1/2006_04_01_107_21.pdf|accessdate=April 17, 2014|newspaper=The California Tech|date=April 3, 2006|volume=107|number=21|page=3}}</ref>\n\nThe two most famous in recent history are the changing of the [[Hollywood Sign]] to read \"Caltech\", by judiciously covering up certain parts of the letters, and the changing of the scoreboard to read Caltech 38, MIT 9 during the [[1984 Rose Bowl|1984 Rose Bowl Game]].

These include covering up the word Massachusetts in the \"Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" engraving on the main building fa\u00e7ade with a banner so that it read \"That Other Institute of Technology\". A group of [[Hacks at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT hackers]] responded by altering the banner so that the inscription read \"The Only Institute of Technology.\" Caltech students also passed out T-shirts to MIT's incoming freshman class that had MIT written on the front and \"... because not everyone can go to Caltech\" along with an image of a palm tree on the back.\n\nMIT retaliated in April 2006, when students posing as the Howe & Ser (Howitzer) Moving Company stole the 130-year-old, 1.7-ton Fleming House cannon and moved it over 3000 miles to their campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts for their 2006 Campus Preview Weekend, repeating a similar prank performed by nearby [[Harvey Mudd College]] in 1986. Thirty members of Fleming House traveled to MIT and reclaimed their cannon on April 10, 2006.\n\nOn April 13, 2007 (Friday the 13th), a group of students from ''The California Tech'', Caltech's campus newspaper, arrived and distributed fake copies of ''The Tech'', MIT's campus newspaper, while prospective students were visiting for their Campus Preview Weekend. Articles included \"MIT Invents the Interweb\", \"Architects Deem Campus 'Unfortunate'\", and \"[[Infinite Corridor]] Not Actually Infinite\".\n\nIn December 2009, some Caltech students declared that MIT had been sold and had become the Caltech East campus. A \"sold\" banner was hung on front of the MIT dome building and a \"Welcome to Caltech East: School of the Humanities\" banner over the Massachusetts Avenue Entrance. Newspapers and T-shirts were distributed, and door labels and fliers in the infinite corridor were put up in accordance with the \"curriculum change.\"<ref>[http://east.caltech.edu/ Caltech Opens Humanities School at MIT Campus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202233541/http://east.caltech.edu/ |date=December 2, 2009 }}, December 6, 2009</ref><ref>[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_13939751 Citybeats: Future Tournament of Roses chief vows even better parades], ''Pasadena Star-News'', December 6, 2009</ref>\n\nIn September 2010, MIT students attempted to put a [[TARDIS]], the time machine from the BBC's ''[[Doctor Who]]'', onto a roof.

For example, the honor code allows professors to make the majority of exams as take-home, allowing students to take them on their own schedule and in their preferred environment.\n\nThrough the late 1990s, the only exception to the honor code, implemented earlier in the decade in response to changes in federal regulations, concerned the sexual harassment policy. Today, there are myriad exceptions to the honor code in the form of new institute policies such as the fire policy, and alcohol policy. Although both policies are presented in the Honor System Handbook given to new members of the Caltech community, some undergraduates regard them as a slight against the honor code and the implicit trust and respect it represents within the community.<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Rodriguez\n  | first =Juan\n  | title =Ricketts Pres.

The promotion of physics made him a public figure of science, although his Nobel-winning work in [[quantum electrodynamics]] was already very established in the scientific community. [[Murray Gell-Mann]], a Nobel-winning physicist, introduced a classification of [[hadrons]] and went on to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, which is currently accepted as part of the [[Standard Model]]. Long-time Caltech President [[Robert Andrews Millikan]] was the first to calculate the charge of the [[electron]] with his well-known [[oil-drop experiment]], while [[Richard Chace Tolman]] is remembered for his contributions to [[cosmology]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] winner [[H. David Politzer]] is a current professor at Caltech, as is astrophysicist and author [[Kip Thorne]] and eminent mathematician [[Barry Simon]]. [[Linus Pauling]] pioneered [[quantum chemistry]] and [[molecular biology]], and went on to discover the nature of the chemical bond in 1939. Seismologist [[Charles Richter]], also an alumnus, developed the magnitude scale that bears his name, the [[Richter magnitude scale]] for measuring the power of earthquakes. One of the founders of the geochemistry department, [[Clair Patterson]] was the first to accurately determine the age of the Earth via lead:uranium ratio in meteorites.  In engineering, [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]] made many key advances in aerodynamics, notably his work on [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] airflow characterization. A repeating pattern of swirling [[vortices]] is named after him, the [[von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n vortex street]]. Participants in von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT project included [[Frank Malina]], who helped develop the [[WAC Corporal]] which was the first U.S. rocket to reach the edge of space, [[Jack Parsons (rocket engineer)|Jack Parsons]], a pioneer in the development of liquid and solid rocket fuels who designed the first castable composite-based rocket motor, and [[Qian Xuesen]], who was dubbed the \"Father of Chinese Rocketry\". More recently, [[Michael E. Brown|Michael Brown]], a professor of planetary astronomy, discovered many [[trans-Neptunian object]]s, most notably the [[dwarf planet]] [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], which prompted the [[International Astronomical Union]] to redefine the term \"[[planet]]\".\n\n[[David Baltimore]], the Robert A. Millikan Professor of Biology, and [[Alice S. Huang|Alice Huang]], Senior Faculty Associate in Biology, have served as the President of [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] from 2007\u20132008 and 2010\u20132011 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.aaas.org/people/plist.php?type=President |title=AAAS Presidents |publisher=AAAS |year=2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\n33% of the faculty are members of the [[National Academy of Science]] or [[National Academy of Engineering|Engineering]] and/or fellows of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

His works include some of Italy's most famous and best-loved plays. Audiences have admired the plays of Goldoni for their ingenious mix of wit and honesty. His plays offered his contemporaries images of themselves, often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the emerging [[middle class]]es. Though he wrote in French and Italian, his plays make rich use of the [[Venetian language]], regional vernacular, and colloquialisms. Goldoni also wrote under the [[pen name]] and title \"Polisseno Fegeio, Pastor Arcade,\" which he claimed in his memoirs the \"[[Accademia degli Arcadi|Arcadians]] of Rome\" bestowed on him.<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Goldoni\n|first = Carlo\n|others=John Black (trans.)\n|title = Memoirs of Goldoni\n|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-J4wIpSCmEQC&pg=PA331\n|format = Google books\n|accessdate = 6 September 2008\n|year = 1814\n|publisher = Henry Colburn\n|location = London\n|pages = 331\n|chapter = XVII}}</ref>\n\nOne of his best known works is the comic play ''[[Servant of Two Masters]]'', which has been translated and adapted internationally numerous times. In 2011, [[Richard Bean]] adapted the play for the [[National Theatre of Great Britain]] as ''[[One Man, Two Guvnors]]''. Its popularity led to a transfer to the [[West End theatre|West End]] and in 2012 to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]].\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Memoirs ===\nThere is an abundance of autobiographical information on Goldoni, most of which comes from the introductions to his plays and from his ''Memoirs''. However, these memoirs are known to contain many errors of fact, especially about his earlier years.\n\nIn these memoirs, he paints himself as a born comedian, careless, light-hearted and with a happy temperament, proof against all strokes of fate, yet thoroughly respectable and honorable.\n\n=== Early life and studies ===\n[[File:Palazzo Centani e Rio San Toma.jpg|thumb|''Palazzo Centani'' birthplace of Goldoni in Venice]]\nGoldoni was born in [[Venice]] in 1707, the son of Margherita and Giulio Goldoni. In his memoirs, Goldoni describes his father as a [[physician]], and claims that he was introduced to theatre by his grandfather Carlo Alessandro Goldoni. In reality, it seems that Giulio was an [[apothecary]]; as for the grandfather, he had died four years before Carlo's birth. In any case, Goldoni was deeply interested in theatre from his earliest years, and all attempts to direct his activity into other channels were of no avail; his toys were puppets, and his books, plays.\n\nHis father placed him under the care of the philosopher Caldini at [[Rimini]] but the youth soon ran away with a company of strolling players and returned to Venice. In 1723 his father matriculated him into the stern [[Collegio Ghislieri]] in [[Pavia]], which imposed the [[tonsure]] and [[monk|monastic habits]] on its students. However, he relates in his ''Memoirs'' that a considerable part of his time was spent in reading Greek and [[Latin]] comedies. He had already begun writing at this time and, in his third year, he composed a [[libel]]lous poem (''Il colosso'') in which he ridiculed the daughters of certain Pavian families. As a result of that incident (and/or of a visit paid with some schoolmates to a local brothel) he was expelled from the school and had to leave the city (1725). He studied law at [[Udine]], and eventually took his degree at [[University of Modena]]. He was employed as a law clerk at [[Chioggia]] and [[Feltre]], after which he returned to his native city and began practicing.\n[[File:Monument to Carlo Goldoni (Venice).jpg|thumb|Monument to Goldoni in [[Venice]] (sculpted by Antonio Dal Zotto)]]\nEducated as a lawyer, and holding lucrative positions as secretary and counsellor, he seemed, indeed, at one time to have settled down to the practice of law, but following an unexpected summons to Venice, after an absence of several years, he changed his career, and thenceforth he devoted himself to writing plays and managing theatres. His father died in 1731. In 1732, to avoid an unwanted marriage, he left the town for [[Milan]] and then for [[Verona]] where the theatre manager Giuseppe Imer helped him on his way to becoming a comical poet as well as introducing him to his future wife, Nicoletta Conio. Goldoni returned with her to Venice, where he stayed until 1743.\n\n=== Theatrical career ===\n[[Image:Statua di Carlo Goldoni (Firenze).JPG|thumb|Monument to Goldoni in [[Florence]] (sculpted by [[Ulisse Cambi]])]]\n\nGoldoni entered the Italian theatre scene with a [[tragedy]], ''[[Amalasunta]]'', produced in Milan. The play was a critical and financial failure.\n\nSubmitting it to Count Prata, director of the opera, he was told that his piece \"was composed with due regard for the rules of [[Aristotle]] and [[Horace]], but not according to those laid down for the Italian drama.\" \"In France\", continued the count, \"you can try to please the public, but here in Italy it is the actors and actresses whom you must consult, as well as the composer of the music and the stage decorators. Everything must be done according to a certain form which I will explain to you.\"\n\nGoldoni thanked his critic, went back to his inn and ordered a fire, into which he threw the manuscript of his ''Amalasunta''.\n\nHis next play, ''Belisario'', written in 1734, was more successful, though of its success he afterward professed himself ashamed.\n\nDuring this period he also wrote [[librettos]] for [[opera seria]] and served for a time as literary director of the [[Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo|San Giovanni Grisostomo]], Venice's most distinguished [[opera house]].<ref name=\"cgt\">Banham (1998, 433).</ref>\n\nHe wrote other tragedies for a time, but he was not long in discovering that his bent was for [[comedy]]. He had come to realize that the Italian stage needed reforming; adopting [[Moli\u00e8re]] as his model, he went to work in earnest and in 1738 produced his first real comedy, ''L'uomo di mondo'' (\"The Man of the World\"). During his many wanderings and adventures in Italy, he was constantly at work and when, at [[Livorno]], he became acquainted with the manager Medebac, he determined to pursue the profession of playwriting in order to make a living. He was employed by Medebac to write plays for his theater in Venice. He worked for other managers and produced during his stay in that city some of his most characteristic works. He also wrote ''Momolo Cortesan'' in 1738. By 1743, he had perfected his hybrid style of playwriting (combining the model of [[Moli\u00e8re]] with the strengths of [[Commedia dell'arte]] and his own wit and sincerity). This style was typified in ''La Donna di garbo'', the first Italian comedy of its kind.\n\nAfter 1748, Goldoni collaborated with the composer [[Baldassare Galuppi]], making significant contributions to the new form of '[[opera buffa]]'. Galuppi composed the score for more than twenty of Goldoni's librettos. As with his comedies, Goldoni's ''opera buffa'' integrate elements of the Commedia dell'arte with recognisable local and middle-class realities. His operatic works include two of the most successful musical comedies of the eighteenth century, ''Il filosofo di campagna'' (''The Country Philosopher''), set by Galuppi (1752) and ''[[La buona figliuola]]'' (''The Good Girl''), set by [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]] (1760).<ref name=\"cgt\"/>\n\nIn 1753, following his return from Bologna he defected to the [[Teatro San Luca]] of the [[Vendramin]] family where he performed most of his plays to 1762.\n\n=== Move to France and death ===\n[[File:Carlo Goldoni buste neige.jpg|thumb|130px|Bust of Goldoni, near [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in Paris]]\n\nIn 1757, he engaged in a bitter dispute with playwright [[Carlo Gozzi]], which left him utterly disgusted with the tastes of his countrymen; so much so that in 1761 he moved to Paris, where he received a position at court and was put in charge of the [[Com\u00e9die-Italienne|Theatre Italien]]. He spent the rest of his life in France, composing most of his plays in French and writing his memoirs in that language.\n\nAmong the plays which he wrote in French, the most successful was ''[[Le bourru bienfaisant]]'', produced on the occasion of the marriage of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and [[Marie Antoinette]] in 1771. He enjoyed considerable popularity in France; when he retired to [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], the King gave him a pension. He lost this pension after the [[French Revolution]]. The Convention eventually voted to restore his pension the day after his death. It was restored to his widow, at the pleading of the poet [[Andr\u00e9 Ch\u00e9nier]]; \"She is old\", he urged, \"she is seventy-six, and her husband has left her no heritage save his illustrious name, his virtues and his poverty.\"\n[[File:Commedie del dottore Carlo Goldoni.tif|thumb|''Commedie del dottore Carlo Goldoni'' (1753)]]\n\n== Goldoni's impact on Italian theatre ==\nIn his ''Memoirs'' Goldoni amply discusses the state of Italian comedy when he began writing. At that time, Italian comedy revolved around the conventionality of the [[Commedia dell'arte]], or improvised comedy. Goldoni took to himself the task of superseding the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners through the characters and their behaviors. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before.\n\nHis works are a lasting monument to the changes that he initiated: a dramatic revolution that had been attempted but not achieved before. Goldoni's importance lay in providing good examples rather than precepts. Goldoni says that he took for his models the plays of [[Moli\u00e8re]] and that whenever a piece of his own succeeded he whispered to himself: \"Good, but not yet Moli\u00e8re.\" Goldoni's plays are gentler and more optimistic in tone than Moli\u00e8re's.\n\nIt was this very success that was the object of harsh critiques by [[Carlo Gozzi]], who accused Goldoni of having deprived the Italian theatre of the charms of poetry and imagination. The great success of Gozzi's fairy dramas so irritated Goldoni that it led to his self-exile to France.\n\nGoldoni gave to his country a classical form, which, though it has since been cultivated, has yet to be cultivated by a master.\n\n== Themes ==\nGoldoni's plays that were written while he was still in Italy ignore [[religion|religious]] and [[ecclesiastical]] subjects. This may be surprising, considering his staunch [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] upbringing. No thoughts are expressed about death or repentance in his memoirs or in his comedies. After his move to France, his position became clearer, as his plays took on a clear [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] tone and often satirized the hypocrisy of monks and of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]].\n\nGoldoni was inspired by his love of humanity and the admiration he had for his fellow men. He wrote, and was obsessed with, the relationships that humans establish with one another, their cities and homes, the [[Humanism|Humanist]] movement, and the study of [[philosophy]]. The moral and civil values that Goldoni promotes in his plays are those of rationality, civility, humanism, the importance of the rising middle-class, a progressive stance to state affairs, honor and honesty. Goldoni had a dislike for arrogance, intolerance and the abuse of power.\n\nGoldoni's main characters are no abstract examples of human virtue, nor monstrous examples of human vice. They occupy the middle ground of human temperament. Goldoni maintains an acute sensibility for the differences in social classes between his characters as well as environmental and generational changes. Goldoni pokes fun at the arrogant nobility and the pauper who lacks dignity.\n\n== Venetian and Tuscan ==\nAs in other theatrical works of the time and place, the characters in Goldoni's Italian comedies spoke originally either the literary Tuscan variety (which became modern Italian) or the [[Venetian language|Venetian dialect]], depending on their station in life. However, in some printed editions of his plays he often turned the Venetian texts into Tuscan, too.\n\n== Goldoni in popular culture ==\n*The film ''Carlo Goldoni \u2013 Venice, Grand Theatre of the World'', directed by Alessandro Bettero, was released in 2007 and is available in English, Italian, French, and Japanese.<ref>http://www.goldonithemovie.com/index.php?lan=en goldonithemovie</ref>\n\n== Selected works ==\n{{main|List of works by Carlo Goldoni}}\n\nThe following is a small sampling of Goldoni's enormous output.\n\n=== Tragedies ===\n* ''Rosmonda'' (1734)\n* ''[[Griselda (Vivaldi)|Griselda]]'' (1734)\n\n=== Tragicomedies ===\n*''Belisario'' (1734)\n*''Don Giovanni Tenorio'' o sia ''Il dissoluto'', \"The Dissolute\" (1735)\n*''Rinaldo di Montalbano'' (1736)\n\n=== Comedies ===\n*''[[Servant of Two Masters|Il servitore di due padroni]]'', (1745) \"The Servant of Two Masters\" (now often retitled ''Arlecchino servitore di due padroni'' \"Harlequin Servant of two Masters\")\n*''[[I due gemelli veneziani]]'', \"The Two Venetian Twins\" (1747)<ref>[http://www.piccoloteatro.org/gemelli/mainspett.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215200039/http://www.piccoloteatro.org/gemelli/mainspett.htm |date=15 February 2012 }}</ref>\n*''La vedova scaltra'', \"The Shrewd Widow\" (1748)<ref group=C>''La vedova scaltra'' was used for operas by [[Marcello Bernardini]] (as ''La donna di spirito'') in 1770, [[Vincenzo Righini]] in 1774, [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]] in 1773, [[Pasquale Anfossi]] in 1780, and [[Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari]] in 1931 (see ''[[La vedova scaltra]]'').</ref>\n*''[[La putta onorata]]'', \"The Honorable Maid\" (1749)\n*''[[Il cavaliere e la dama]]'', \"The Gentleman and the Lady\" (1749)\n*''[[La famiglia dell'antiquario]]'', \"The Antiquarian's Family\" (1750)\n*''[[Il teatro comico]]'', \"The Comical Theatre\" (1750\u20131751)\n*''[[The Liar (Goldoni play)|Il bugiardo]]'', \"The Liar\" (1750\u20131751)\n*''[[Il vero amico]]'', \"The True Friend\" (1750) translated by Anna Cuffaro\n*''[[I pettegolezzi delle donne]]'', \"Women's Gossip\" (1750\u20131751)\n*''[[The Mistress of the Inn|La locandiera]]'', \"The Mistress of the Inn\" (1751)\n*''[[Il feudatario]]'' \"The Feudal Lord\" (1752)\n*''[[Gl'innamorati]]'', \"The Lovers\" (1759)\n*''[[The Boors|I rusteghi]]'', \"The Boors\" (1760)\n*''[[Le baruffe chiozzotte]]'' (1762) \"The Chioggia Scuffles\"\n*''[[Gli amori di Zelinda e Lindoro]]'', \"The Love of Zelinda and Lindoro\" (1764)\n\n=== Opera seria libretti ===\n* ''Amalasunta'' (1732)\n* ''[[Gustavo primo, re di Svezia|Gustavo]]'' (c. 1738)\n* ''Oronte, re de' Sciti'' (1740)\n* ''Statira'' (c. 1740)\n\n===Opera buffa libretti===\n* ''La contessina'' (''The Young Countess'') by [[Giacomo Maccari|Maccari]] (1743)\n* ''L'Arcadia in Brenta'' (''The [[Arcadia]] in [[Brenta, Lombardy|Brenta]]'') by [[Baldassare Galuppi|Galuppi]] (1749)\n* ''Il mondo della luna'' (''The World on the Moon''), set to music by [[Il mondo della luna (Galuppi)|Galuppi]] (1750), [[Il mondo della luna|Haydn]] (1777), [[Il mondo della luna (Paisiello)|Paisiello]] (1782) and other composers.\n* ''[[Il filosofo di campagna]]'' (''The Country Philosopher'') by Galuppi (1752)\n* ''Il mercato di Malmantile'' (''The Malmantile Market'') by [[Domenico Fischietti|Fischietti]] (1757)\n* ''[[Buovo d'Antona (Traetta)|Buovo d'Antona]]'', set to music by [[Tommaso Traetta]] (1758, incorrectly recorded as 1750 in Zatta's edition)\n* ''[[La buona figliuola]]'' (''The Good Girl'') by [[Niccol\u00f2 Piccinni]] (1760)\n* ''[[Lo speziale]]'' (''The Apothecary'') by [[Joseph Haydn]] (1768)\n* ''[[La finta semplice]]'' (''The Fake Innocent'') by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] (1769)\n* ''[[Le pescatrici]]'' (''The Fisherwomen'') by Haydn (1770)\n\n=== Intermezzo libretti ===\n* ''[[Le donne vendicate]]'', \"The Revenge of the Women\" (1751)\n\n=== Cantatas and serenades ===\n* ''La ninfa saggia'', \"The Wise Nymph\" (17??)\n* ''Gli amanti felici'', \"The Happy Lovers\" (17??)\n\n=== Poetry ===\n* ''Il colosso'', a satire against Pavia girls which led to Goldoni being expelled from Collegio Ghislieri (1725)\n* ''Il quaresimale in epilogo'' (1725\u20131726)\n\n=== Books ===\n* ''Nuovo teatro comico'', \"New Comic Theater\", plays.

x.}}\n{{refimprove|date=March 2010}}\n\n[[File:Normal Distribution CDF.svg|thumb|300px|Cumulative distribution function for the normal distribution]]\n\nIn [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]], the '''cumulative distribution function''' ('''CDF''') of a real-valued [[random variable]] ''X'', or just '''distribution function''' of ''X'', evaluated at ''x'', is the [[probability]] that ''X'' will take a value less than or equal to ''x''.\n\nIn the case of a [[continuous distribution]], it gives the area under the [[probability density function]] from minus infinity to ''x''.  Cumulative distribution functions are also used to specify the distribution of [[multivariate random variable]]s.\n\n==Definition==\nThe cumulative distribution function of a real-valued [[random variable]] ''X'' is the function  given by\n\n:<math>F_X(x) = \\operatorname{P}(X\\leq x),</math>\n\nwhere the right-hand side represents the [[probability]] that the random variable ''X'' takes on a value less than or\nequal to ''x''. The probability that ''X'' lies in the semi-closed [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] (''a'',&nbsp;''b''<nowiki>]</nowiki>, where ''a''&nbsp; < &nbsp;''b'', is therefore\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}(a < X \\le b)= F_X(b)-F_X(a).</math>\n\nIn the definition above, the \"less than or equal to\" sign, \"\u2264\", is a convention, not a universally used one (e.g. Hungarian literature uses \"<\"), but is important for discrete distributions. The proper use of tables of the [[Binomial distribution|binomial]] and [[Poisson distribution]]s depends upon this convention. Moreover, important formulas like [[Paul L\u00e9vy (mathematician)|Paul L\u00e9vy]]'s inversion formula for the [[Characteristic function (probability theory)#Inversion formulae|characteristic function]] also rely on the \"less than or equal\" formulation.\n\nIf treating several random variables ''X'',&nbsp;''Y'',&nbsp;... etc. the corresponding letters are used as subscripts while, if treating only one, the subscript is usually omitted. It is conventional to use a capital ''F'' for a cumulative distribution function, in contrast to the lower-case ''f'' used for [[probability density function]]s and [[probability mass function]]s. This applies when discussing general distributions: some specific distributions have their own conventional notation, for example the [[normal distribution]].\n\nThe CDF of a [[continuous random variable]] ''X'' can be expressed as the integral of its probability density function \u0192<sub>X</sub> as follows:\n\n:<math>F_X(x) = \\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(t)\\,dt.</math>\n\nIn the case of a random variable ''X'' which has distribution having a discrete component at a value ''b'',\n:<math>\\operatorname{P}(X=b) = F_X(b) - \\lim_{x \\to b^{-}} F_X(x).</math>\n\nIf ''F<sub>X</sub>'' is continuous at ''b'', this equals zero and there is no discrete component at ''b''.\n\n== Properties ==\n[[Image:Discrete probability distribution illustration.svg|right|thumb|From top to bottom, the cumulative distribution function of a discrete probability distribution, continuous probability distribution, and a distribution which has both a continuous part and a discrete part.]]\n\nEvery cumulative distribution function ''F'' is [[monotone increasing|non-decreasing]] and [[right-continuous]], which makes it a [[c\u00e0dl\u00e0g]] function. Furthermore,\n:<math>\\lim_{x\\to -\\infty}F(x)=0, \\quad \\lim_{x\\to +\\infty}F(x)=1.</math>\n\nEvery function with these four properties is a CDF, i.e., for every such function, a [[random variable]] can be defined such that the function is the cumulative distribution function of that random variable.\n\nIf ''X'' is a purely [[discrete random variable]], then it attains values ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ... with probability ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = P(''x''<sub>''i''</sub>), and the CDF of ''X'' will be [[discontinuity (mathematics)|discontinuous]] at the points ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> and constant in between:\n\n:<math>F(x) = \\operatorname{P}(X\\leq x) = \\sum_{x_i \\leq x} \\operatorname{P}(X = x_i) = \\sum_{x_i \\leq x} p(x_i).</math>\n\nIf the CDF ''F'' of a real valued random variable ''X'' is [[continuous function|continuous]], then ''X'' is a [[continuous random variable]]; if furthermore ''F'' is [[absolute continuity|absolutely continuous]], then there exists a [[Lebesgue integral|Lebesgue-integrable]] function ''f''(''x'') such that\n\n:<math>F(b)-F(a) = \\operatorname{P}(a< X\\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx</math>\n\nfor all real numbers ''a'' and ''b''. The function ''f'' is equal to the [[derivative]] of ''F'' [[almost everywhere]], and it is called the [[probability density function]] of the distribution of ''X''.\n\n== Examples ==\nAs an example, suppose <math>X</math> is [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] on the unit interval [0,&nbsp;1].\nThen the CDF of <math>X</math> is given by\n\n:<math>F(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 &:\\ x < 0\\\\\nx &:\\ 0 \\le x < 1\\\\\n1 &:\\ x \\ge 1.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nSuppose instead that <math>X</math> takes only the discrete values 0 and 1, with equal probability.\nThen the CDF of <math>X</math> is given by\n\n:<math>F(x) = \\begin{cases}\n0 &:\\ x < 0\\\\\n1/2 &:\\ 0 \\le x < 1\\\\\n1 &:\\ x \\ge 1.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\n==Derived functions==\n===Complementary cumulative distribution function (tail distribution)===<!-- This section is linked from [[Power law]], [[Stretched exponential function]] and [[Weibull distribution]] -->\nSometimes, it is useful to study the opposite question and ask how often the random variable is ''above'' a particular level.  This is called the '''complementary cumulative distribution function''' ('''ccdf''') or simply the '''tail distribution''' or '''exceedance''', and is defined as\n\n:<math>\\bar F(x) = \\operatorname{P}(X > x) = 1 - F(x).</math>\n\nThis has applications in [[statistics|statistical]] [[hypothesis test]]ing, for example, because the one-sided [[p-value]] is the probability of observing a test statistic ''at least'' as extreme as the one observed. Thus, provided that the [[test statistic]], ''T'', has a continuous distribution,  the one-sided [[p-value]] is simply given by the ccdf: for an observed value ''t'' of the test statistic\n:<math>p= \\operatorname{P}(T \\ge t) = \\operatorname{P}(T > t) =1 - F_T(t).</math>\n\nIn [[survival analysis]], <math>\\bar F(x)</math> is called the '''[[survival function]]''' and denoted <math> S(x) </math>, while the term ''reliability function'' is common in [[engineering]].\n\n;Properties\n* For a non-negative continuous random variable having an expectation, [[Markov's inequality]] states that<ref name=\"ZK\">{{cite book| last1 = Zwillinger| first1 = Daniel| last2 = Kokoska| first2 = Stephen| title = CRC Standard Probability and Statistics Tables and Formulae| year = 2010| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-1-58488-059-2| page = 49 }}</ref>\n:: <math>\\bar F(x) \\leq \\frac{\\operatorname{E}(X)}{x} .</math>\n* As <math> x \\to \\infty, \\bar F(x) \\to 0 \\ </math>, and in fact <math> \\bar F(x) = o(1/x) </math> provided that <math>\\operatorname{E}(X)</math> is finite.\n:Proof:{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Assuming X has a density function f, for any <math> c> 0 </math>\n::<math>\n\\operatorname{E}(X) = \\int_0^\\infty xf(x) \\, dx \\geq \\int_0^c xf(x) \\, dx + c\\int_c^\\infty f(x) \\, dx\n</math>\n:Then, on recognizing <math>\\bar F(c) = \\int_c^\\infty f(x) \\, dx </math> and rearranging terms,\n::<math>\n0 \\leq c\\bar F(c) \\leq \\operatorname{E}(X) - \\int_0^c x f(x) \\, dx \\to 0 \\text{  as  } c \\to \\infty\n</math>\n:as claimed.\n\n===Folded cumulative distribution===\n[[Image:Folded-cumulative-distribution-function.svg|thumb|right|Example of the folded cumulative distribution for a [[normal distribution]] function with an [[expected value]] of 0 and a [[standard deviation]] of 1.]]\nWhile the plot of a cumulative distribution often has an S-like shape, an alternative illustration is the '''folded cumulative distribution''' or '''mountain plot''', which folds the top half of the graph over,<ref name=\"Gentle\">{{cite book| author = Gentle, J.E.| title = Computational Statistics| url = https://books.google.com/?id=m4r-KVxpLsAC&pg=PA348| accessdate = 2010-08-06| year = 2009| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]| isbn = 978-0-387-98145-1 }}{{Page needed|date=June 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"Monti\">\n{{cite journal|author=Monti, K.L.|pages=342\u2013345|year=1995|title=Folded Empirical Distribution Function Curves (Mountain Plots) |journal=The American Statistician|volume=49|jstor=2684570|doi=10.2307/2684570}}</ref>\nthus using two scales, one for the upslope and another for the downslope.

In such a case, this defines the '''inverse distribution function''' or [[quantile function]].\n\nSome distributions do not have a unique inverse (for example in the case where <math>f_X(x)=0</math> for all <math>a<x<b</math>, causing <math>F_X</math> to be constant).  This problem can be solved by defining, for <math> p \\in [0,1] </math>, the '''generalized inverse distribution function''':\n:<math>\nF^{-1}(p) = \\inf  \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}: F(x) \\geq p \\}.\n</math>\n* Example 1: The median is <math>F^{-1}( 0.5 )</math>.\n* Example 2: Put <math> \\tau = F^{-1}( 0.95 ) </math>.  Then we call <math> \\tau </math> the 95th percentile.\n\nSome useful properties of the inverse cdf (which are also preserved in the definition of the generalized inverse distribution function) are:\n\n# <math>F^{-1}</math> is nondecreasing\n# <math>F^{-1}(F(x)) \\leq x</math>\n# <math>F(F^{-1}(p)) \\geq p</math>\n# <math>F^{-1}(p) \\leq x</math> if and only if <math>p \\leq F(x)</math>\n# If <math>Y</math> has a <math>U[0, 1]</math> distribution then <math>F^{-1}(Y)</math> is distributed as <math>F</math>.

For example, for a pair of random variables ''X,Y'', the joint CDF <math>F</math> is given by\n\n:<math>F(x,y) = \\operatorname{P}(X\\leq x,Y\\leq y),</math>\n\nwhere the right-hand side represents the [[probability]] that the random variable ''X'' takes on a value less than or\nequal to ''x'' and that ''Y'' takes on a value less than or\nequal to ''y''.\n\nEvery multivariate CDF is:\n# Monotonically non-decreasing for each of its variables,\n# Right-continuous in each of its variables,\n# <math>0\\leq F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)\\leq 1,</math>\n# <math>\\lim_{x_1,\\ldots,x_n \\rightarrow+\\infty}F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=1 \\text{ and } \\lim_{x_i\\rightarrow-\\infty}F(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=0, \\text{for all } i.</math>\n\n==Use in statistical analysis==\n\nThe concept of the cumulative distribution function makes an explicit appearance in statistical analysis in two (similar) ways. [[Cumulative frequency analysis]] is the analysis of the frequency of occurrence of values of a phenomenon less than a reference value. The [[empirical distribution function]] is a formal direct estimate of the cumulative distribution function for which simple statistical properties can be derived and which can form the basis of various [[statistical hypothesis test]]s. Such tests can assess whether there is evidence against a sample of data having arisen from a given distribution, or evidence against two samples of data having arisen from  the same (unknown) population distribution.\n\n===Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov and Kuiper's tests===\nThe [[Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test]] is based on cumulative distribution functions and can be used to test to see whether two empirical distributions are different or whether an empirical distribution is different from an ideal distribution. The closely related [[Kuiper's test]] is useful if the domain of the distribution is cyclic as in day of the week. For instance Kuiper's test might be used to see if the number of tornadoes varies during the year or if sales of a product vary by day of the week or day of the month.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Descriptive statistics]]\n* [[Distribution fitting]]\n* [[Ogive (statistics)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Cumulative distribution functions}}\n\n{{Theory of probability distributions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cumulative Distribution Function}}\n[[Category:Functions related to probability distributions]]", "sha1": "k3zims4vj669egoqb4nu6rare2vr2pj"}}, {"title": "Central tendency", "ns": "0", "id": "5794", "revision": {"id": "859408903", "parentid": "859359636", "timestamp": "2018-09-13T21:32:12Z", "contributor": {"username": "Mwtoews", "id": "711150"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Undid revision 859359636 by [[Special:Contributions/Rifat mehemud|Rifat mehemud]] ([[User talk:Rifat mehemud|talk]]) poor grammar, and a repeat of what is already stated in the first paragraph", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{for|the graph/network concept|Centrality}}\nIn [[statistics]], a '''central tendency''' (or '''measure of central tendency''') is a central or typical value for a [[probability distribution]].<ref name=Weisberg>Weisberg H.F (1992) ''Central Tendency and Variability'', Sage University Paper Series on Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences,  {{ISBN|0-8039-4007-6}} p.2</ref> It may also be called a '''center''' or '''location''' of the distribution. Colloquially, measures of central tendency are often called ''[[averages]].'' The term ''central tendency'' dates from the late 1920s.<ref name=Upton/>\n\nThe most common measures of central tendency are the [[arithmetic mean]], the [[median]] and the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]. A central tendency can be calculated for either a finite set of values or for a theoretical distribution, such as the [[normal distribution]]. Occasionally authors use central tendency to denote \"the tendency of quantitative [[data]] to cluster around some central value.\"<ref name=Upton>Upton, G.; Cook, I. (2008) ''Oxford Dictionary of Statistics'', OUP {{ISBN|978-0-19-954145-4}} (entry for \"central tendency\")</ref><ref name=Dodge>Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP for [[International Statistical Institute]]. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}} (entry for \"central tendency\")</ref>\n\nThe central tendency of a distribution is typically contrasted with its ''[[statistical dispersion|dispersion]]'' or ''variability''; dispersion and central tendency are the often characterized properties of distributions. Analysts may judge whether data has a strong or a weak central tendency based on its dispersion.\n\n==Measures==\n\nThe following may be applied to one-dimensional data. Depending on the circumstances, it may be appropriate to transform the data before calculating a central tendency. Examples are squaring the values or taking logarithms. Whether a transformation is appropriate and what it should be, depend heavily on the data being analyzed.\n\n; [[Arithmetic mean]] <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">or simply,</span> mean: the sum of all measurements divided by the number of observations in the data set.\n; [[Median]]: the middle value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data set. The median and the mode are the only measures of central tendency that can be used for [[Level of measurement#Ordinal scale|ordinal data]], in which values are ranked relative to each other but are not measured absolutely.\n; [[Mode (statistics)|Mode]]: the most frequent value in the data set. This is the only central tendency measure that can be used with [[Level of measurement#Nominal scale|nominal data]], which have purely qualitative category assignments.\n; [[Geometric mean]]: the [[Nth root|''n''th root]] of the product of the data values, where there are ''n'' of these. This measure is valid only for data that are measured absolutely on a strictly positive scale.\n; [[Harmonic mean]]: the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the data values. This measure too is valid only for data that are measured absolutely on a strictly positive scale.\n; [[Weighted arithmetic mean]]: an arithmetic mean that incorporates weighting to certain data elements.\n; [[Truncated mean]] <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">or</span> trimmed mean: the arithmetic mean of data values after a certain number or proportion of the highest and lowest data values have been discarded.\n:; [[Interquartile mean]]: a truncated mean based on data within the [[interquartile range]].\n; [[Midrange]]: the arithmetic mean of the maximum and minimum values of a data set.\n; [[Midhinge]]: the arithmetic mean of the two [[quartile]]s.\n; [[Trimean]]: the weighted arithmetic mean of the median and two quartiles.\n; [[Winsorized mean]]: an arithmetic mean in which extreme values are replaced by values closer to the median.\n\nAny of the above may be applied to each dimension of multi-dimensional data, but the results may not be invariant to rotations of the multi-dimensional space. In addition, there are the\n\n; [[Geometric median]]: which minimizes the sum of distances to the data points. This is the same as the median when applied to one-dimensional data, but it is not the same as taking the median of each dimension independently. It is not invariant to different rescaling of the different dimensions.\n; [[Quadratic mean]] <span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">(often known as the [[root mean square]])</span>: useful in engineering, but not often used in statistics. This is because it is not a good indicator of the center of the distribution when the distribution includes negative values.\n; [[Simplicial depth]]: the probability that a randomly chosen [[simplex]] with vertices from the given distribution will contain the given center\n; [[Tukey median]]: a point with the property that every halfspace containing it also contains many sample points\n\n==Solutions to variational problems==\nSeveral measures of central tendency can be characterized as solving a variational problem, in the sense of the [[calculus of variations]], namely minimizing variation from the center. That is, given a measure of [[statistical dispersion]], one asks for a measure of central tendency that minimizes variation: such that variation from the center is minimal among all choices of center. In a quip, \"dispersion precedes location\". This center may or may not be unique. In the sense of [[Lp space|''L''<sup>''p''</sup> spaces]], the correspondence is:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! ''L''<sup>''p''</sup> !! dispersion !! central tendency\n|-\n! ''L''<sup>0</sup>\n| [[variation ratio]]\n| [[Mode (statistics)|mode]]\n|-\n! ''L''<sup>1</sup>\n| [[average absolute deviation]]\n| [[median]]\n|-\n! ''L''<sup>1</sup>\n| [[average absolute deviation]]\n| [[geometric median]]\n|-\n! ''L''<sup>2</sup>\n| [[standard deviation]]\n| [[mean]]\n|-\n! ''L''<sup>\u221e</sup>\n| [[maximum deviation]]\n| [[midrange]]\n|}\n\nThe associated functions are called [[p-norm|''p''-norms]]: respectively 0-\"norm\", 1-norm, 2-norm, and \u221e-norm. The function corresponding to the ''L''<sup>0</sup> space is not a norm, and is thus often referred to in quotes: 0-\"norm\".\n\nIn equations, for a given (finite) data set ''X'', thought of as a vector <math>\\mathbf{x} = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n)</math>, the dispersion about a point ''c'' is the \"distance\" from '''x''' to the constant vector <math>\\mathbf{c} = (c, \\ldots, c)</math> in the ''p''-norm (normalized by the number of points ''n''):\n\n:<math>f_p(c) = \\left\\| \\mathbf{x} - \\mathbf{c} \\right\\|_p := \\bigg( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left| x_i - c\\right| ^p \\bigg) ^{1/p}.</math>\n\nNote that for <math>p = 0</math> and <math>p = \\infty</math> these functions are defined by taking limits, respectively as <math>p \\to 0</math> and <math>p \\to \\infty</math>. For <math>p = 0</math> the limiting values are <math>0^0 = 0</math> and <math>a^0 = 1</math> for <math>a \\neq 0</math>, so the difference becomes simply equality, so the 0-norm counts the number of ''unequal'' points. For <math>p = \\infty</math> the largest number dominates, and thus the \u221e-norm is the maximum difference.\n\n===Uniqueness===\nThe mean (''L''<sup>2</sup> center) and midrange (''L''<sup>\u221e</sup> center) are unique (when they exist), while the median (''L''<sup>1</sup> center) and mode (''L''<sup>0</sup> center) are not in general unique. This can be understood in terms of [[convex function|convexity]] of the associated functions ([[coercive function]]s).\n\nThe 2-norm and \u221e-norm are [[strictly convex]], and thus (by convex optimization) the minimizer is unique (if it exists), and exists for bounded distributions. Thus standard deviation about the mean is lower than standard deviation about any other point, and the maximum deviation about the midrange is lower than the maximum deviation about any other point.\n\nThe 1-norm is not ''strictly'' convex, whereas strict convexity is needed to ensure uniqueness of the minimizer.

People may also become celebrities due to media attention on their lifestyle, wealth, or controversial actions, or for their connection to a famous person.\n\n==History==\nAthletes in [[Ancient Greece]] were welcomed home as heroes, had songs and poems written in their honor, and received free food and gifts from those seeking [[celebrity endorsement]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = Ancient Greek Athletics|last = Miller|first = Stephen|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0-300-11529-6|location = |pages = }}</ref> [[Ancient Rome]] similarly lauded actors and notorious gladiators, and [[Julius Caesar]] appeared on a coin in his own lifetime (a departure from the usual depiction of battles and divine lineage).<ref name=BBC>{{Cite web|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1777554.stm|title = A brief history of celebrity|date = April 4, 2003|accessdate = June 8, 2014|website = BBC News|publisher = BBC|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nIn the early 12th century, [[Thomas Becket]] became famous following his murder. He was promoted by the Christian Church as a martyr and images of him and scenes from his life became widespread in just a few years. In a pattern often repeated, what started out as an explosion of popularity (often referred to with the suffix 'mania') turned into a long-lasting fame: pilgrimages to Canterbury Cathedral where he was killed became instantly fashionable and the fascination with his life and death have inspired plays and films.\n\nThe cult of personality (particularly in the west) can be traced back to the Romantics in the 18th century,<ref>{{cite book|title = A Short History of Celebrity|author = Morgan, Dr Simon|publisher = Princeton University Press|date  = 2010}}</ref> whose livelihood as artists and poets depended on the currency of their reputation. The establishment of cultural hot-spots became an important factor in the process of generating fame: for example, London and Paris in the 18th and 19th centuries. Newspapers started including gossip columns <ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/news/concisehistbritnews/britnews19th/ | title = Concise History of the British Newspaper in the Nineteenth Century | publisher = British Library}}</ref> and certain clubs and events became places to be seen in order to receive publicity.\n\nThe movie industry spread around the globe in the first half of the 20th century and with it the now familiar concept of the instantly recognizable faces of its superstars. Yet, celebrity wasn't always tied to actors in films, especially when cinema was starting out as a medium. As Paul McDonald states in ''The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities'', \"in the first decade of the twentieth century, American film production companies withheld the names of film performers, despite requests from audiences, fearing that public recognition would drive performers to demand higher salaries.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Star System: Hollywood's Production of Popular Identities|last = McDonald|first = Paul|publisher = Wallflower|year = 2000|isbn = 978-1-903364-02-4|location = Great Britain|pages = 15}}</ref>  Public fascination went well beyond the on-screen exploits of [[movie star]]s and their private lives became headline news: for example, in Hollywood the marriages of [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and in [[Bollywood]] the affairs of [[Raj Kapoor]] in the 1950s.\n\nThe second half of the century saw television and popular music bring new forms of celebrity, such as the rock star and the pop group, epitomised by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[the Beatles]], respectively. [[John Lennon]]'s highly controversial 1966 quote: \"We're more popular than [[Jesus]] now,\"<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.beatlesbible.com/1966/03/04/how-does-a-beatle-live-by-maureen-cleave/ |publisher = London Evening Standard|date  = 1966|author = Cleave, Maureen|title=How does a beatle live}}</ref> which he later insisted was not a boast, and that he was not in any way comparing himself with Christ,{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} gives an insight into both the adulation and notoriety that fame can bring. Unlike movies, television created celebrities who were not primarily actors; for example, presenters, talk show hosts, and news readers. However, most of these are only famous within the regions reached by their particular broadcaster, and only a few such as [[Oprah Winfrey]], [[Jerry Springer]], or [[David Frost]] could be said to have broken through into a wider stardom.\n\nIn the '60s and early '70s the book publishing industry began to persuade major celebrities to put their names on autobiographies and other titles in a genre called celebrity publishing. In most cases the book was not written by the celebrity but by a ghost-writer, but the celebrity would then be available for a book tour and appearances on talk shows.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Another Life: A Memoir of Other People|last=Korda|first=Michael|publisher=Simon & Schuster|year=|isbn=9780679456599|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Regional and cultural implications==\n[[File:Lydia Canaan in Concert.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lydia Canaan]], first rock star of the [[Middle East]]]]\n\nCultures and regions with a significant population may have their own independent celebrity systems, with distinct hierarchies. For example, the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], which is French-speaking, has its own system of French-speaking television, movie and music celebrities. A person who garners a degree of fame in one culture may be considered less famous or obscure in another. Some nationwide celebrities might command some attention outside their own nation; for example, the singer [[Lara Fabian]] is widely known in the [[French-speaking]] world, but only had a couple of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hits in the U.S., whereas the francophone Canadian singer [[Celine Dion]] is well known in both the French-speaking world and in the United States.\n\nRegions within a country, or cultural communities (linguistic, ethnic, or religious) can also have their own celebrity systems, especially in linguistically or culturally distinct regions such as [[Quebec]] or [[Wales]]. Regional radio personalities, [[newscasters]], politicians or community [[leader]]s may be local or regional celebrities.\n\nIn politics, certain politicians are recognizable to many people, usually the head of state and the Prime Minister. Yet only heads of state who play a major role in international politics have a good chance of becoming famous outside their country's borders, since they are constantly featured in [[mass media]]. [[The President of the United States]], for instance, is famous by name and face to millions of people around the world. Since World War II the [[U.S. Presidential elections]] are followed closely all across the globe, making the elected candidate instantly world-famous as a result. In contrast, both the [[Pope]] and [[The Dalai Lama]] are far more famous under their official title than under their actual names. Usually when politicians leave active politics their recognizability tends to diminish among general audiences, as other politicians replace them in their official political functions. Certain politicians, however, are still famous today, even decades or centuries after they were in power. They owe their fame to historical deeds which are kept in memory in history classes, for instance people like [[Julius Caesar]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Mao Zedong]]. [[Scandal]] can also unwillingly make certain politicians famous, even among those who aren't particularly interested in politics.\n\nEnglish-speaking media commentators and journalists will sometimes refer to celebrities as belonging to the ''[[A-List]]'' or state that a certain actor belongs to the ''B-List'', the latter being a disparaging context. These informal rankings indicate a placing within a hierarchy. However, due to differing levels of celebrity in different regions, it is difficult to place people within one bracket. A Brazilian actor might be a B-list action film actor in the U.S., but an A-list star in Portugal.\n\nSome elements are associated with fame, such as appearing on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', being spoofed in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', having a wax statue in ''[[Madame Tussauds]]'', or receiving a star on the ''[[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].''\n \nCertain people are known even to people unfamiliar with the area in which they excelled. If one has to name a famous boxer, they are more likely to name [[Muhammad Ali]] or [[Mike Tyson]], since their fame expanded beyond the sport itself. [[Pablo Picasso]]'s style and name are known even to people who are not interested in art; likewise many know that [[Harry Houdini]] was an illusionist, [[Tiger Woods]] a golfer, [[Richard Branson]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Donald Trump]] are entrepreneurs, [[Albert Einstein]] a scientist; [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] classical composers; [[Luciano Pavarotti]] an opera singer, [[Bruce Lee]] a martial artist, [[William Shakespeare]] a playwright, [[Walt Disney]] an animator and [[Yuri Gagarin]] and [[Neil Armstrong]] astronauts.\n\nCriminals can also become world-famous if the media cover their crimes, arrest, trial and possible punishment extensively and/or if the crime itself is sensational enough. Assassins of high-profile celebrities can become famous, like [[Brutus]] who is remembered for murdering [[Julius Caesar]]. People who commit extremely gruesome crimes can also achieve infamy, such as Nazi doctor [[Josef Mengele]]. Certain criminals have achieved lasting fame thanks to romanticization in popular culture, such as [[Guy Fawkes]], [[Blackbeard]], [[Billy the Kid]] and [[Bonnie & Clyde]]. Others owe their fame to never being identified or caught, like [[Jack the Ripper]], or by regularly  being interviewed in jail, like [[Charles Manson]]. However, certain criminals are covered far less extensively in media and, as such, don't become very famous at all. In other cases the huge media coverage disappears after the conclusion of their trial, causing them to fade in obscurity again. This has even happened to people who commit high-profile crimes, like [[Fran\u00e7ois Ravaillac]] whose murder of [[Henry IV of France]] in 1610 is nowadays only remembered by people with historic knowledge. In some cases people who've been acquitted of certain crimes are still remembered as being guilty today, like [[Lizzie Borden]], showing that the sensation occasionally overshadows the actual facts.\n\n===Fictional implications===\nThe same phenomenon is true for fictional characters. [[Sherlock Holmes]], [[Dracula]], [[Frankenstein's Monster]] and [[James Bond]] continue to be portrayed in film, television and literature decades after the original stories were published. [[Superman]], [[Spider-Man]], [[The Hulk]], [[Wonder Woman]], and [[Batman]] represent super heroes to a far wider audience than that of the comics and graphic novels in which they appear. The same can be said about other comics characters which enjoy international distribution and syndication such as [[Popeye]], [[Tintin (character)|Tintin]], [[Snoopy]], [[Ast\u00e9rix]], [[Garfield (character)|Garfield]] and [[Astro Boy]]. [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] have theme parks around the world which rely on the fame of its creations headed by [[Mickey Mouse]]. Thanks to the global reach of film and television characters like [[King Kong]], [[Godzilla]], [[The Flintstones]], [[The Muppets]] and [[The Simpsons]] are instantly recognizable to millions. Certain fictional characters known from TV series have become so famous that their names are more well known than those of the actors who perform them. A good example is [[Larry Hagman]] who played [[J.R. Ewing]] on the TV series ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. When his character was shot during a [[cliffhanger]] episode without the viewers knowing who was the killer, it caused a media hype around the question: ''[[Who Shot J.R.?]]''. By the time the answer was given in the first episode of the next season millions of people instantly recognized Hagman's face as J.R. rather than that of himself. Some characters from video and computer games have developed a celebrity life beyond these media, such as [[Mario]], [[Lara Croft]] and [[Pikachu]]. Certain advertising characters have also become iconic thanks to decades of constant merchandising, such as [[Ronald McDonald]]\n, [[Bibendum]] and [[Hello Kitty]].\n\n==Becoming a celebrity==\n[[File:A. Schwarzenegger.jpg|thumb|[[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] is an Austrian-American actor, producer, businessman, investor, author, philanthropist, activist, politician, and former professional bodybuilder. He served two terms as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 to 2011]]\n\nPeople may become celebrities in a wide range of ways; from their professions, following appearances in the media, or by complete accident. The term \"instant celebrity\" describes someone who becomes a celebrity in a very short period of time. Someone who achieves a small amount of [[15 minutes of fame|transient fame]] (through, say, [[Media circus|hype]] or mass media) may become labeled a \"B-grade celebrity\". Often, the generalization extends to someone who falls short of mainstream or persistent fame but who seeks to extend or exploit it.\n\n===Success===\nThere are, of course, no guarantees of success for an individual to become a celebrity. Though celebrities come from many different working fields, most celebrities are typically associated with the fields of sports and entertainment, or a person may be a public figure who is commonly recognizable in mass media with commercial and critical acclaim.\n\nThough glamour and wealth may certainly play a role for only famous celebrities, most people in the sports and entertainments spheres, be it music, film, television, radio, modelling, comedy, literature etc. live in obscurity and only a small percentage achieve fame and fortune.<ref>{{cite web |author=Book of Odds (View Profile) |url=http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |title=Odds of Becoming a YouTube Celebrity |publisher=DivineCaroline |date= |accessdate=2011-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102034806/http://www.divinecaroline.com/50616/110803-odds-becoming-youtube-celebrity |archivedate=January 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Natalie Boxall |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2007/may/26/graduates.careers |title=Making it in the music industry &#124; Money |work=The Guardian |date= May 30, 2007|accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=White |first=Alison |url=http://careers.guardian.co.uk/careers-blog/music-industry-careers?commentpage=all |title=Live Q&A: Career options in the music industry &#124; Guardian careers &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Careers.guardian.co.uk |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |title=Chances of Making it to the NHL |publisher=Cumberlandminorhockey.ca |date=2002-04-01 |accessdate=2011-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219081012/http://www.cumberlandminorhockey.ca/to_the_nhl/chances.htm |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOutside of the sports and entertainment sphere, the top inventors, professionals such as doctors, lawyers, and scientists, etc. are unlikely to become celebrities even if they are enormously successful in their field due to society's disinterest in science, [[invention]], [[medicine]], and courtroom law which is not fictional.

For minor league to amateur athletes, earnings are usually on the lower end of the pay-scale.

Although it has become commonplace for celebrities to place their name with endorsements onto products just for quick money, some celebrities have gone beyond merely using their names and have put their entrepreneurial spirit to work by becoming entrepreneurs by attaching themselves in the business aspects of entertainment and building their own business brand beyond their traditional salaried activities. Along with investing their salaried wages into growing business endeavors, a number of celebrities have become innovative business leaders in their respective industries, gaining the admiration of their peers and contributing to the country\u2019s economy.\n\nNumerous celebrities have ventured into becoming [[business mogul]]s and established themselves as entrepreneurs, idolizing many well known American business leaders such as [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]].

Not all celebrities eventually succeed with their own businesses and other related side ventures. Some celebrities either went [[wikt:broke|broke]] or filed for bankruptcy as result of dabbling with such side businesses or endorsements. Though some might question such a validity since celebrities themselves are already well known, have mass appeal, and are well exposed to the general public. The average entrepreneur who is not well known and reputable to general public doesn't the same marketing flexibility and status-quo as most celebrities allow and have. Therefore, compared to the average person who starts a business, celebrities already have all the cards and odds stacked in their favor.

Due to the high visibility of celebrities' private lives, their successes and shortcomings are often made very public. Celebrities are alternately portrayed as glowing examples of perfection, when they garner awards, or as decadent or immoral if they become associated with a scandal. When seen in a positive light, celebrities are frequently portrayed as possessing skills and abilities beyond average people; for example, celebrity actors are routinely celebrated for acquiring new skills necessary for filming a role within a very brief time, and to a level that amazes the professionals who train them. Similarly, some celebrities with very little formal education can sometimes be portrayed as experts on complicated issues. Some celebrities have been very vocal with their political views.

It is often used in [[marketing research]]. In this sampling plan, the total population is divided into these groups (known as clusters) and a [[simple random sample]] of the groups is selected. The elements in each cluster are then sampled. If all elements in each sampled cluster are sampled, then this is referred to as a \"one-stage\" cluster sampling plan. If a simple random subsample of elements is selected within each of these groups, this is referred to as a \"two-stage\" cluster sampling plan. A common motivation for cluster sampling is to reduce the total number of interviews and costs given the desired accuracy. For a fixed sample size, the expected [[Observational error|random error]] is smaller when most of the variation in the population is present internally within the groups, and not between the groups.\n\n==Cluster elements==\nThe population within a cluster should ideally be as heterogeneous as possible, but there should be homogeneity between clusters. Each cluster should be a small-scale representation of the total population. The clusters should be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive. A random sampling technique is then used on any relevant clusters to choose which clusters to include in the study. In single-stage cluster sampling, all the elements from each of the selected clusters are sampled. In two-stage cluster sampling, a random sampling technique is applied to the elements from each of the selected clusters.\n\nThe main difference between cluster sampling and [[stratified sampling]] is that in cluster sampling the cluster is treated as the sampling unit so sampling is done on a population of clusters (at least in the first stage).  In stratified sampling, the sampling is done on elements within each strata. In stratified sampling, a random sample is drawn from each of the strata, whereas in cluster sampling only the selected clusters are sampled. A common motivation of cluster sampling is to reduce costs by increasing sampling efficiency. This contrasts with stratified sampling where the motivation is to increase precision.\n\nThere is also [[multistage sampling|multistage cluster sampling]], where at least two stages are taken in selecting elements from clusters.\n\n==When clusters are of different sizes==\n\nWithout modifying the estimated parameter, cluster sampling is unbiased when the clusters are approximately the same size. In this case, the parameter is computed by combining all the selected clusters. When the clusters are of different sizes, [[sampling (statistics)#Probability-proportional-to-size sampling|probability proportionate to size sampling]] is used. In this sampling plan, the probability of selecting a cluster is proportional to its size, so that a large clusters has a greater probability of selection than a small cluster. However, when clusters are selected with probability proportionate to size, the same number of interviews should be carried out in each sampled cluster so that each unit sampled has the same probability of selection.\n\n==Applications of cluster sampling==\nAn example of cluster sampling is [[area sampling]] or [[geographical cluster sampling]]. Each cluster is a geographical area. Because a geographically dispersed population can be expensive to survey, greater economy than simple random sampling can be achieved by grouping several respondents within a local area into a cluster. It is usually necessary to increase the total sample size to achieve equivalent precision in the [[estimator]]s, but cost savings may make such an increase in sample size feasible.\n\nCluster sampling is used to estimate high mortalities in cases such as [[war]]s, [[famine]]s and [[natural disaster]]s.<ref>David Brown, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/10/AR2006101001442.html Study Claims Iraq's 'Excess' Death Toll Has Reached 655,000], ''Washington Post'', Wednesday, October 11, 2006. Retrieved September 14, 2010.</ref>\n\n==Advantage==\n\n* Can be cheaper than other sampling plans \u2013 e.g. fewer travel expenses, administration costs.\n*Feasibility: This sampling plan takes large populations into account. Since these groups are so large, deploying any other sampling plan would be very costly.\n*Economy: The regular two major concerns of expenditure, i.e., traveling and listing, are greatly reduced in this method. For example: Compiling research information about every household in a city would be very costly, whereas compiling information about various blocks of the city will be more economical. Here, traveling as well as listing efforts will be greatly reduced.\n*Reduced variability: When estimates are being considered by any other method, reduced variability in results are observed. This may not be an ideal situation every time.\nMajor use: when sampling frame of all elements is not available we can resort only to the cluster sampling.\n\n==Disadvantage==\n\n* Higher [[sampling error]], which can be expressed in the so-called \"design effect\", the ratio between the number of subjects in the cluster study and the number of subjects in an equally reliable, randomly sampled unclustered study.<ref>Kerry and Bland (1998).

''British Medical Journal'',  316, 1455\u20131460.</ref>\n*Biased samples: If the group in population that is chosen as a sample has a biased opinion, then the entire population is inferred to have the same opinion. This may not be the actual case.\n\nErrors: The other probabilistic methods give fewer errors than this method. For this reason, it is discouraged for beginners.\n\n==More on cluster sampling==\n\n===Two-stage cluster sampling===\nTwo-stage cluster sampling, a simple case of [[multistage sampling]], is obtained by selecting cluster samples in the first stage and then selecting sample of elements from every sampled cluster. Consider a population of ''N'' clusters in total. In the first stage, ''n'' clusters are selected using ordinary cluster sampling method. In the second stage, [[simple random sampling]] is usually used.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ahmed|first=Saifuddin|title=Methods in Sample Surveys|year=2009|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University and Saifuddin Ahmed|url=http://ocw.jhsph.edu/courses/statmethodsforsamplesurveys/PDFs/Lecture5.pdf}}</ref> It is used separately in every cluster and the numbers of elements selected from different clusters are not necessarily equal. The total number of clusters ''N'', number of clusters selected ''n'', and numbers of elements from selected clusters need to be pre-determined by the survey designer. Two-stage cluster sampling aims at minimizing survey costs and at the same time controlling the uncertainty related to estimates of interest.<ref>{{cite book| author = Daniel Pfeffermann|author2=C.

For instance, it can be necessary to cluster at the state or city level, units that may be small and fixed in number. Microeconometrics methods for panel data often use short panels, which is analogous to having few observations per clusters and many clusters. The small cluster problem can be viewed as an incidental parameter problem.<ref>Cameron A. C. and P. K. Trivedi (2005): Microeconometrics: Methods and Applications. Cambridge University Press, New York.</ref> While the point estimates can be reasonably precisely estimated, if the number of observations per cluster is sufficiently high, we need the number of clusters <math>G\\rightarrow \\infty</math> for the asymptotics to kick in. If the number of clusters is low the estimated covariance matrix can be downward biased.<ref name=\"CameronMiller\">Cameron, C. and D. L. Miller (2015): A Practitioner's Guide to Cluster-Robust Inference. Journal of Human Resources 50(2), pp. 317-372.</ref>\n\nSmall numbers of clusters is a risk when there is serial correlation or when there is intraclass correlation as in the Moulton context. When having few clusters, we tend to underestimate serial correlation across observations when a random shock occurs, or the intraclass correlation in a Moulton setting.<ref name=\"AngristPischke\">Angrist, J.D. and J.-S. Pischke (2009): Mostly Harmless Econometrics. An empiricist's companion. Princeton University Press, New Jersey.</ref> Several studies have highlighted the consequences of serial correlation correlation and highlighted the small-cluster problem.<ref>Bertrand, M., E. Duflo and S. Mullainathan (2004): How Much Should We Trust Differences-in-Differences Estimates? Quarterly Journal of Economics 119(1), pp. 249-275.</ref><ref>Kezdi, G. (2004): Robust Standard Error Estimation in Fixed-Effect Panel Models. Hungarian Statistical Review 9, pp. 95-116.</ref>\n\nIn the framework of the Moulton factor, an intuitive explanation of the small cluster problem can be derived from the formula for the Moulton factor. Assume for simplicity that the number of observation per cluster is fixed at ''n''. Below, <math>V_{c}(\\beta)</math> stands for the covariance matrix adjusted for clustering, <math>V(\\beta)</math> stands for the covariance matrix not adjusted for clustering, and \u03c1 stands for the intraclass correlation:\n\n<math>\\frac{V_{c}(\\hat\\beta)}{V(\\hat\\beta)}=1+(n-1)\\rho</math>\n\nThe ratio on the left-hand side provides an indication of how much the unadjusted scenario overestimates the precision. Therefore, a high number means a strong downward bias of the estimated covariance matrix. A small cluster problem can be interpreted as a large n: when the data is fixed and the number of clusters is low, the number of data within a cluster can be high. It follows that inference when the number of clusters is small will not have correct coverage.<ref name=\"AngristPischke\"/>\n\nSeveral solutions for the small cluster problem have been proposed. One can use a bias-corrected cluster-robust variance matrix, make T-distribution adjustments, or use bootstrap methods with asymptotic refinements, such as the percentile-t or wild bootstrap, that can lead to improved finite sample inference.<ref name=\"CameronMiller\"/> Cameron, Gelbach and Miller (2008) provide microsimulations for different methods and find that the wild bootstrap performs well in the face of a small number of clusters.<ref>Cameron, C., J. Gelbach and D. L. Miller (2008): Bootstrap-Based Improvements for Inference with Clustered Errors.

Baudelaire's highly original style of prose-poetry influenced a whole generation of poets including [[Paul Verlaine]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]], among many others. He is credited with coining the term \"[[modernity]]\" (''modernit\u00e9'') to designate the fleeting, ephemeral experience of life in an urban metropolis, and the responsibility of artistic expression to capture that experience.<ref>\"By modernity I mean the transitory, the fugitive, the contingent which make up one half of art, the other being the eternal and the immutable.\" Charles Baudelaire, \"The Painter of Modern Life\" in ''The Painter of Modern Life and Other Essays'', edited and translated by Jonathan Mayne.

Fran\u00e7ois died during Baudelaire's childhood, at rue Hautefeuille, Paris, on February 10, 1827. The following year, Caroline married Lieutenant Colonel Jacques Aupick, who later became a French ambassador to various noble courts. Baudelaire's biographers have often seen this as a crucial moment, considering that finding himself no longer the sole focus of his mother's affection left him with a trauma, which goes some way to explaining the excesses later apparent in his life. He stated in a letter to her that, \"There was in my childhood a period of passionate love for you.\"<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 16</ref> Baudelaire regularly begged his mother for money throughout his career, often promising that a lucrative publishing contract or journalistic commission was just around the corner.\n\nBaudelaire was educated in [[Lyon]], where he boarded. At fourteen he was described by a classmate as \"much more refined and distinguished than any of our fellow pupils ... we are bound to one another ... by shared tastes and sympathies, the precocious love of fine works of literature.\"<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 35</ref> Baudelaire was erratic in his studies, at times diligent, at other times prone to \"idleness\". Later, he attended the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, studying law, a popular course for those not yet decided on any particular career. He began to frequent prostitutes and may have contracted [[gonorrhea]] and [[syphilis]] during this period. He also began to run up debts, mostly for clothes. Upon gaining his [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1839, he told his brother \"I don't feel I have a vocation for anything.\" His stepfather had in mind a career in law or diplomacy, but instead Baudelaire decided to embark upon a literary career. His mother later recalled: \"Oh, what grief! If Charles had let himself be guided by his stepfather, his career would have been very different.... He would not have left a name in literature, it is true, but we should have been happier, all three of us.\"<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 70</ref>\n\n[[File:Baudelaire 1844.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of Baudelaire, painted in 1844 by Emile Deroy (1820\u20131846)]]\nHis stepfather sent him on a voyage to [[Calcutta, India]], in 1841 in the hope of ending his dissolute habits. The trip provided strong impressions of the sea, sailing, and exotic ports, that he later employed in his poetry.<ref>Richardson 1994, pp. 67\u201368</ref> (Baudelaire later exaggerated his aborted trip to create a legend about his youthful travels and experiences, including \"riding on elephants\".) On returning to the taverns of Paris, he began to compose some of the poems of \"Les Fleurs du Mal\". At 21, he received a sizable inheritance but squandered much of it within a few years. His family obtained a decree to place his property in trust,<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 71</ref> which he resented bitterly, at one point arguing that allowing him to fail financially would have been the one sure way of teaching him to keep his finances in order.\n\nBaudelaire became known in artistic circles as a [[dandy]] and free-spender, going through much of his inheritance and allowance in a short period of time. During this time, [[Jeanne Duval]] became his mistress. She was rejected by his family. His mother thought Duval a \"Black Venus\" who \"tortured him in every way\" and drained him of money at every opportunity.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 75</ref> Baudelaire made a suicide attempt during this period.\n\nHe took part in the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France|Revolutions of 1848]] and wrote for a revolutionary newspaper. However, his interest in politics was passing, as he was later to note in his journals.\n\nIn the early 1850s, Baudelaire struggled with poor health, pressing debts, and irregular literary output. He often moved from one lodging to another to escape creditors. He undertook many projects that he was unable to complete, though he did finish translations of stories by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n\nUpon the death of his stepfather in 1857, Baudelaire received no mention in the will but he was heartened nonetheless that the division with his mother might now be mended. At 36 he wrote her: \"believe that I belong to you absolutely, and that I belong only to you\".<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 219.</ref> His mother died on August 16, 1871, outliving her son by almost four years.\n\n==Published career==\nHis first published work, under the pseudonym Baudelaire Dufa\u00ffs,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Vicaire|first1=Georges|title=Manual de L'Amateur de Livres du XIXe Si\u00e8cle: 1801-1893|date=1894|publisher=Librairie A.

Many of his critical opinions were novel in their time, including his championing of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], and some of his views seem remarkably in tune with the future theories of the Impressionist painters.\n\nIn 1846, Baudelaire wrote his second Salon review, gaining additional credibility as an advocate and critic of [[Romanticism]]. His continued support of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]] as the foremost Romantic artist gained widespread notice.<ref name = \"crapkq\">Richardson 1994, p. 110.</ref> The following year Baudelaire's novella ''[[La Fanfarlo]]'' was published.\n\n===''The Flowers of Evil''===\n[[Image:Fleurs du mal.jpg|thumb|upright|The first edition of ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]'' with author's notes]]\nBaudelaire was a slow and very attentive worker.

Introductory preface to: ''The Poems and Prose Poems of Charles Baudelaire''. New York: Brentano's, 1919. p. xvii</ref>\n\nThe poems found a small, yet appreciative audience. However, greater public attention was given to their subject matter. The effect on fellow artists was, as [[Th\u00e9odore de Banville]] stated, \"immense, prodigious, unexpected, mingled with admiration and with some indefinable anxious fear\".<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 236.</ref> [[Gustave Flaubert]], recently attacked in a similar fashion for ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (and acquitted), was impressed and wrote to Baudelaire: \"You have found a way to rejuvenate Romanticism.... You are as unyielding as marble, and as penetrating as an English mist.\"<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 241.</ref>\n\nThe principal themes of [[Human sexuality|sex]] and death were considered scandalous for the period. He also touched on lesbianism, sacred and profane love, metamorphosis, melancholy, the corruption of the city, lost innocence, the oppressiveness of living, and wine. Notable in some poems is Baudelaire's use of imagery of the sense of smell and of fragrances, which is used to evoke feelings of [[nostalgia]] and past intimacy.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 231.</ref>\n\nThe book, however, quickly became a byword for unwholesomeness among mainstream critics of the day. Some critics called a few of the poems \"masterpieces of passion, art and poetry,\" but other poems were deemed to merit no less than legal action to suppress them.<ref>Richardson 1994, pp. 232\u2013237</ref> J. Habas writing in ''[[Le Figaro]]'', led the charge against Baudelaire, writing: \"Everything in it which is not hideous is incomprehensible, everything one understands is putrid.\" Then Baudelaire responded to the outcry, in a prophetic letter to his mother:\n<blockquote>\n\"You know that I have always considered that literature and the arts pursue an aim independent of morality. Beauty of conception and style is enough for me. But this book, whose title (''Fleurs du mal'') says everything, is clad, as you will see, in a cold and sinister beauty. It was created with rage and patience. Besides, the proof of its positive worth is in all the ill that they speak of it. The book enrages people. Moreover, since I was terrified myself of the horror that I should inspire, I cut out a third from the proofs. They deny me everything, the spirit of invention and even the knowledge of the French language. I don't care a rap about all these imbeciles, and I know that this book, with its virtues and its faults, will make its way in the memory of the lettered public, beside the best poems of V. Hugo, Th. Gautier and even Byron.\"<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 238.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Rops Les Epaves 1866.jpg|thumb|upright|Illustration cover for ''[[Les \u00c9paves]]'', by Baudelaire's friend [[F\u00e9licien Rops]]]]\nBaudelaire, his publisher and the [[printer (publisher)|printer]] were successfully prosecuted for creating an offense against public [[morality|morals]].

Another edition of ''Les Fleurs du mal'', without these poems, but with considerable additions, appeared in 1861. Many notables rallied behind Baudelaire and condemned the sentence.

But at last, his mother relented and agreed to let him live with her for a while at [[Honfleur]]. Baudelaire was productive and at peace in the seaside town, his poem ''Le Voyage'' being one example of his efforts during that time.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 281.</ref> In 1860, he became an ardent supporter of [[Richard Wagner]].\n\nHis financial difficulties increased again, however, particularly after his publisher Poulet Malassis went bankrupt in 1861. In 1864, he left Paris for Belgium, partly in the hope of selling the [[copyright|rights]] to his works and also to give lectures.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 400</ref> His long-standing relationship with [[Jeanne Duval]] continued on-and-off, and he helped her to the end of his life. Baudelaire's relationships with actress Marie Daubrun and with courtesan [[Apollonie Sabatier]], though the source of much inspiration, never produced any lasting satisfaction. He smoked [[opium]], and in Brussels he began to [[alcoholism|drink to excess]]. Baudelaire suffered a massive stroke in 1866 and [[paralysis]] followed. After more than a year of [[aphasia]], he received the [[last rites]] of the Catholic Church.<ref>[http://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/baudelaire/englishintro.html Library.vanderbilt.edu]</ref> The last two years of his life were spent, in a semi-paralyzed state, in \"maisons de sant\u00e9\" in Brussels and in Paris, where he died on August 31, 1867. Baudelaire is buried in the [[Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse]], Paris.\n\nMany of Baudelaire's works were published posthumously. After his death, his mother paid off his substantial debts, and at last she found some comfort in Baudelaire's emerging fame. \"I see that my son, for all his faults, has his place in literature.\" She lived another four years.\n\n==Poetry==\n{{quote|Who among us has not dreamt, in moments of ambition, of the miracle of a poetic prose, musical without rhythm and rhyme, supple and staccato enough to adapt to the lyrical stirrings of the soul, the undulations of dreams, and sudden leaps of consciousness. This obsessive idea is above all a child of giant cities, of the intersecting of their myriad relations.|Dedication of ''[[Le Spleen de Paris]]}}\n\nBaudelaire is one of the major innovators in [[French literature]]. His poetry is influenced by the French romantic poets of the earlier 19th century, although its attention to the formal features of verse connects it more closely to the work of the contemporary \"Parnassians\". As for theme and tone, in his works we see the rejection of the belief in the supremacy of nature and the fundamental goodness of man as typically espoused by the romantics and expressed by them in rhetorical, effusive and public voice in favor of a new urban sensibility, an awareness of individual moral complexity, an interest in vice (linked with [[Decadent movement|decadence]]) and refined sensual and aesthetic pleasures, and the use of urban subject matter, such as the city, the crowd, individual passers-by, all expressed in highly ordered verse, sometimes through a cynical and ironic voice. Formally, the use of sound to create atmosphere, and of \"symbols\" (images that take on an expanded function within the poem), betray a move towards considering the poem as a self-referential object, an idea further developed by the Symbolists [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] and [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]], who acknowledge Baudelaire as a pioneer in this regard.\n\nBeyond his innovations in versification and the theories of symbolism and \"correspondences\", an awareness of which is essential to any appreciation of the literary value of his work, aspects of his work that regularly receive much critical discussion include the role of women, the theological direction of his work and his alleged advocacy of \"satanism\", his experience of drug-induced states of mind, the figure of the dandy, his stance regarding democracy and its implications for the individual, his response to the spiritual uncertainties of the time, his criticisms of the bourgeois, and his advocacy of modern music and painting (e.g., [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]).  He made Paris the subject of modern poetry.  He would bring the city's details to life in the eyes and hearts of his readers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Haine|first1=Scott|title=The History of France|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-30328-2|pages=112|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n==Critiques==\nBaudelaire was an active participant in the artistic life of his times. As critic and essayist, he wrote extensively and perceptively about the luminaries and themes of French culture. He was frank with friends and enemies, rarely took the diplomatic approach and sometimes responded violently verbally, which often undermined his cause.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 268.</ref> His associations were numerous and included: [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Honor\u00e9 Daumier]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Champfleury]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Balzac]] and the artists and writers that follow.\n\n===Edgar Allan Poe===\nIn 1847, Baudelaire became acquainted with the works of [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], in which he found tales and poems that had, he claimed, long existed in his own brain but never taken shape. Baudelaire saw in Poe a precursor and tried to be his French contemporary counterpart.<ref>Richardson 1994, p. 140.</ref> From this time until 1865, he was largely occupied with translating Poe's works; his translations were widely praised. Baudelaire was not the first French translator of Poe, but his \"scrupulous translations\" were considered among the best. These were published as ''Histoires extraordinaires'' (''Extraordinary stories'') (1852), ''Nouvelles histoires extraordinaires'' (''New extraordinary stories'') (1857), ''[[The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket|Aventures d'Arthur Gordon Pym]]'', ''[[Eureka: A Prose Poem|Eureka]]'', and ''Histoires grotesques et s\u00e9rieuses'' (''Grotesque and serious stories'') (1865). Two essays on Poe are to be found in his ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'' (''Complete works'') (vols. v. and vi.).\n\n===Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix===\nA strong supporter of the Romantic painter [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], Baudelaire called him \"a poet in painting\". Baudelaire also absorbed much of Delacroix's aesthetic ideas as expressed in his journals. As Baudelaire elaborated in his \"Salon of 1846\", \"As one contemplates his series of pictures, one seems to be attending the celebration of some grievous mystery.... This grave and lofty melancholy shines with a dull light ... plaintive and profound like a melody by Weber.\"<ref name = \"crapkq\"/> Delacroix, though appreciative, kept his distance from Baudelaire, particularly after the scandal of ''Les Fleurs du mal''. In private correspondence, Delacroix stated that Baudelaire \"really gets on my nerves\" and he expressed his unhappiness with Baudelaire's persistent comments about \"melancholy\" and \"feverishness\".<ref>{{cite book |first=Lois Boe |last=Hyslop |title=Baudelaire, Man of His Time |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1980 |page=14 |isbn=0-300-02513-0 }}</ref>\n\n===Richard Wagner===\nBaudelaire had no formal musical training, and knew little of composers beyond [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]]. Weber was in some ways [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s precursor, using the [[leitmotif]] and conceiving the idea of the \"total art work\" (\"Gesamtkunstwerk\"), both of which gained Baudelaire's admiration. Before even hearing Wagner's music, Baudelaire studied reviews and essays about him, and formulated his impressions. Later, Baudelaire put them into his non-technical analysis of Wagner, which was highly regarded, particularly his essay \"Richard Wagner et Tannh\u00e4user \u00e0 Paris\".<ref name = \"yhkyza\">Hyslop (1980), p. 68.</ref> Baudelaire's reaction to music was passionate and psychological. \"Music engulfs (possesses) me like the sea.\"<ref name = \"yhkyza\"/> After attending three Wagner concerts in Paris in 1860, Baudelaire wrote to the composer: \"I had a feeling of pride and joy in understanding, in being possessed, in being overwhelmed, a truly sensual pleasure like that of rising in the air.\"<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 69</ref> Baudelaire's writings contributed to the elevation of Wagner and to the cult of [[Wagnerism]] that swept Europe in the following decades.\n\n===Th\u00e9ophile Gautier===\n[[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier|Gautier]], writer and poet, earned Baudelaire's respect for his perfection of form and his mastery of language, though Baudelaire thought he lacked deeper emotion and spirituality. Both strove to express the artist's inner vision, which [[Heinrich Heine]] had earlier stated: \"In artistic matters, I am a supernaturalist. I believe that the artist can not find all his forms in nature, but that the most remarkable are revealed to him in his soul.\"<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 131.</ref> Gautier's frequent meditations on death and the horror of life are themes which influenced Baudelaire's writings. In gratitude for their friendship and commonality of vision, Baudelaire dedicated ''Les Fleurs du mal'' to Gautier.\n\n===\u00c9douard Manet===\n[[\u00c9douard Manet|Manet]] and Baudelaire became constant companions from around 1855. In the early 1860s, Baudelaire accompanied Manet on daily sketching trips and often met him socially. Manet also lent Baudelaire money and looked after his affairs, particularly when Baudelaire went to Belgium. Baudelaire encouraged Manet to strike out on his own path and not succumb to criticism. \"Manet has great talent, a talent which will stand the test of time. But he has a weak character. He seems to me crushed and stunned by shock.\"<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 55.</ref> In his painting ''[[Music in the Tuileries]]'', Manet includes portraits of his friends [[Th\u00e9ophile Gautier]], [[Jacques Offenbach]], and Baudelaire.<ref>{{cite web | title = Music in the Tuileries Gardens | publisher=[[National Gallery (London)|The National Gallery]] | url = http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng3260 | accessdate =July 13, 2008}}</ref> While it's difficult to differentiate who influenced whom, both Manet and Baudelaire discussed and expressed some common themes through their respective arts. Baudelaire praised the modernity of Manet's subject matter: \"almost all our originality comes from the stamp that 'time' imprints upon our feelings.\"<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 53.</ref> When Manet's famous ''[[Olympia (painting)|Olympia]]'' (1863), a portrait of a nude prostitute, provoked a scandal for its blatant realism mixed with an imitation of [[Sleeping Venus (Giorgione)|Renaissance motifs]], Baudelaire worked privately to support his friend, though he offered no public defense (he was, however, ill at the time). When Baudelaire returned from Belgium after his stroke, Manet and his wife were frequent visitors at the nursing home and she would play passages from Wagner for Baudelaire on the piano.<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 51.</ref>\n\n===Nadar===\n[[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]] (F\u00e9lix Tournachon) was a noted caricaturist, scientist and important early photographer. Baudelaire admired Nadar, one of his closest friends, and wrote: \"Nadar is the most amazing manifestation of vitality.\"<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 65.</ref> They moved in similar circles and Baudelaire made many social connections through him. Nadar's ex-mistress [[Jeanne Duval]] became Baudelaire's mistress around 1842. Baudelaire became interested in photography in the 1850s and, denouncing it as an art form, advocated its return to \"its real purpose, which is that of being the servant to the sciences and arts\". Photography should not, according to Baudelaire, encroach upon \"the domain of the impalpable and the imaginary\".<ref>Hyslop (1980), p. 63.</ref> Nadar remained a stalwart friend right to Baudelaire's last days and wrote his obituary notice in ''[[Le Figaro]]''.\n\n==Philosophy==\nMany of Baudelaire's philosophical proclamations were considered scandalous and intentionally provocative in his time. He wrote on a wide range of subjects, drawing criticism and outrage from many quarters.\n\n===Love===\n\"There is an invincible taste for prostitution in the heart of man, from which comes his horror of solitude. He wants to be 'two'. The man of genius wants to be 'one'.... It is this horror of solitude, the need to lose oneself in the external flesh, that man nobly calls 'the need to love'.\"<ref name = \"sncxdz\">Richardson 1994, p. 50</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Baudelaire|first1=Charles|title=His Prose and Poetry|date=1919|publisher=Boni and Liveright, inc.|location=New York|page=239}}</ref>\n\n===Marriage===\n\"Unable to suppress love, the Church wanted at least to disinfect it, and it created marriage.\"<ref name = \"sncxdz\"/>\n\n===The artist===\n\"The more a man cultivates the arts, the less randy he becomes.... Only the brute is good at coupling, and copulation is the lyricism of the masses.

In his journals, he wrote, \"There is no form of rational and assured government save an aristocracy. A monarchy or a republic, based upon democracy, are equally absurd and feeble. The immense nausea of advertisements. There are but three beings worthy of respect: the priest, the warrior and the poet. To know, to kill and to create.

The most significant French writers to come after him were generous with tributes; four years after his death, [[Arthur Rimbaud]] praised him in a letter as 'the king of poets, a true God'.<ref>Rimbaud, Arthur: ''Oeuvres compl\u00e8tes'', p. 253, NRF/Gallimard, 1972.</ref> In 1895, [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9]] published a sonnet in Baudelaire's memory, 'Le Tombeau de Charles Baudelaire'. [[Marcel Proust]], in an essay published in 1922, stated that along with [[Alfred de Vigny]], Baudelaire was 'the greatest poet of the nineteenth century'.<ref>''Concerning Baudelaire'' in Proust, Marcel: ''Against Sainte-Beuve and Other Essays'', p. 286, trans. John Sturrock, Penguin, 1994.</ref>\n\nIn the English-speaking world, [[Edmund Wilson]] credited Baudelaire as providing an initial impetus for the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement, by virtue of his translations of Poe.<ref>Wilson, Edmund: ''Axel's Castle'', p. 20, Fontana, 1962 (originally published 1931).</ref>  In 1930, [[T. S. Eliot]], while asserting that Baudelaire had not yet received a \"just appreciation\" even in France, claimed that the poet had \"great genius\" and asserted that his \"technical mastery which can hardly be overpraised ... has made his verse an inexhaustible study for later poets, not only in his own language\".<ref>'Baudelaire', in Eliot, T.

For example, he quoted the last line of Baudelaire's 'Au Lecteur' in the last line of Section I of 'The Waste Land.'{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nAt the same time that Eliot was affirming Baudelaire's importance from a broadly conservative and explicitly Christian viewpoint,<ref>cf.

The poem was originally published anonymously (under the [[pen name]] \"Phin\", based on Thayer's college nickname, \"Phinney\").<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\n==Synopsis==\nA baseball team from the fictional town of \"Mudville\" (implied to be the home team) is losing by two [[Run (baseball)|runs]] in its last inning. Both the team and its fans, a crowd of 5,000, believe they can win if Casey, Mudville's star player, gets to bat. However, Casey is scheduled to be the fifth batter of the inning, and the first two batters (Cooney and Barrows) fail to get on base. The next two batters (Flynn and Jimmy Blake) are perceived to be weak hitters with little chance of reaching base to allow Casey a chance to bat.\n\nSurprisingly, Flynn hits a single, and Blake follows with a double that allows Flynn to reach third base.  Both runners are now in scoring position and Casey represents the potential winning run. Casey is so sure of his abilities that he does not swing at the first two pitches, both called strikes. On the last pitch, the overconfident Casey [[Strikeout|strikes out swinging]], ending the game and sending the crowd home unhappy.\n\n==Text==\n{{Listen\n |filename=CaseyAtTheBat.ogg\n |title=Casey at the Bat\n |description=Recited by [[DeWolf Hopper]], c. 1920.\n |format=[[Ogg]] }}\nThe text is filled with references to baseball as it was in 1888, which in many ways is not far removed from today's version. As a work, the poem encapsulates much of the appeal of baseball, including the involvement of the crowd. It also has a fair amount of baseball jargon that can pose challenges for the uninitiated.\n\nThis is the complete poem as it originally appeared in ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''.  After publication, various versions with minor changes were produced.\n\n{{Quote_box\n|width=20%\n|align=right\n|quote=No one imagines that 'Casey' is great in the sense that the poetry of [[Shakespeare]] or [[Dante]] is great; a comic [[ballad]] obviously must be judged by different standards.

Thayer was only trying to write a comic ballad, with clanking rhymes and a vigorous beat, that could be read quickly, understood at once, and laughed at by any newspaper reader who knew baseball. Somehow, in harmony with the curious laws of humor and popular taste, he managed to produce the [[United States|nation]]'s best-known piece of [[comic verse]]\u2014a ballad that began a native [[legend]] as colorful and permanent as that of [[Johnny Appleseed]] or [[Paul Bunyan]].|author=Martin Gardner|source=[[American Heritage (magazine)|''American Heritage'']]<ref name=Gardner>{{cite journal|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=Casey At The Bat|journal=American Heritage|date=October 1967|volume=18|issue=6|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/casey-bat|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref>}}\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThe outlook wasn't brilliant for the Mudville nine that day;\nthe score stood four to two, with but one inning more to play.\nAnd then when Cooney died at first, and Barrows did the same,\na sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game.\n\nA straggling few got up to go in deep despair. The rest\nclung to that hope which springs eternal in the human breast;\nthey thought, if only Casey could get but a whack at that \u2013\nthey'd put up even money, now, with Casey at the bat.\n\nBut Flynn preceded Casey, as did also Jimmy Blake,\nand the former was a lulu and the latter was a cake,\nso upon that stricken multitude grim melancholy sat,\nfor there seemed but little chance of Casey's getting to the bat.\n\nBut Flynn let drive a single, to the wonderment of all,\nand Blake, the much despised, tore the cover off the ball;\nand when the dust had lifted, and the men saw what had occurred,\nthere was Jimmy safe at second and Flynn a-hugging third.\n\nThen from five thousand throats and more there rose a lusty yell;\nit rumbled through the valley, it rattled in the dell;\nit knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat,\nfor Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.\n\nThere was ease in Casey's manner as he stepped into his place;\nthere was pride in Casey's bearing and a smile on Casey's face.\nAnd when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,\nno stranger in the crowd could doubt 'twas Casey at the bat.\n\nTen thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt;\nfive thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt.\nThen while the writhing pitcher ground the ball into his hip,\ndefiance gleamed in Casey's eye, a sneer curled Casey's lip.\n\nAnd now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,\nand Casey stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there.\nClose by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped\u2014\n\"That ain't my style,\" said Casey. \"Strike one,\" the umpire said.\n\nFrom the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,\nlike the beating of the storm-waves on a stern and distant shore.\n\"Kill him! Kill the umpire!\" shouted someone on the stand;\nand it's likely they'd have killed him had not Casey raised his hand.\n\nWith a smile of Christian charity great Casey's visage shone;\nhe stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;\nhe signaled to the pitcher, and once more the spheroid flew;\nbut Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said: \"Strike two.\"\n\n\"Fraud!\" cried the maddened thousands, and Echo answered fraud;\nbut one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.\nThey saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,\nand they knew that Casey wouldn't let that ball go by again.\n\nThe sneer is gone from Casey's lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;\nhe pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate.\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,\nand now the air is shattered by the force of Casey's blow.\n\nOh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;\nthe band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light,\nand somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout;\nbut there is no joy in Mudville \u2014 mighty Casey has struck out.</poem>}}\n\n==Inspiration==\nThayer said he chose the name \"Casey\" after a non-player of Irish ancestry he once knew, and it is open to debate who, if anyone, he modeled the character after.

The set-up was that [[Penn Jillette]] would leap off his chair upon finishing the poem, releasing the rope which supported Teller, and send his partner to a gruesome death if he wasn't free by that time.  The drama of the performance was taken up a notch after the third or fourth stanza, when Penn Jillette began to read out the rest of the poem much faster than the opening stanzas, greatly reducing the time that Teller had left to work free from his bonds.\n\nOn July 4, 2008, Jack Williams recited the poem accompanied by the [[Boston Pops]] during the annual Boston Pops Fireworks Spectacular at Boston's 4 July Celebration.\n\nOn July 14, 2013, the jam rock band [[Furthur (band)|Furthur]] performed the poem as part of a second-set medley in center field of Doubleday Field in Cooperstown, New York.<ref>https://archive.org/details/furthur2013-07-14.AKGc1000s</ref>\n\n==Recordings==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | headerimage=[[File:2014DworskyKeillor.jpg|210px]] | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwylSCS-OP4 Casey at the Bat], [[Garrison Keillor]] with [[Rich Dworsky]], [[Prairie Home Companion]], 5:29, July 14, 2013 | accessdate = October 15, 2015\n}}\n\nThe first recorded version of \"Casey at the Bat\" was made by [[Russell Hunting]], speaking in a broad Irish accent, in 1893; an [http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr+1=1020&num=1&start=1&query=cylinder5348 1898 cylinder recording of the text made for the Columbia Graphophone label by Hunting] can be accessed from the [[Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] Library.\n\n[[DeWolf Hopper]]'s more famous recorded recitation was released in October 1906.\n\nIn 1946, [[Walt Disney]] released a recording of the narration of the poem by [[Jerry Colonna (entertainer)|Jerry Colonna]], which accompanied the studio's [[animated cartoon]] adaptation of the poem (see below).\n\nIn 1973, the [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]] commissioned its former Composer-in-Residence, [[Frank Proto]], to create a work to feature Baseball Hall-of-Famer [[Johnny Bench]] with the orchestra.

In 1887, Thayer covered baseball for ''[[The San Francisco Examiner|The Daily Examiner]]''\u2014owned by his Harvard classmate [[William Randolph Hearst]]\u2014and is said to have covered the local [[California League]] team, the [[Stockton Ports]]. For the [[1902 in baseball|1902]] season, after the poem became popular, Stockton's team was renamed the Mudville Nine. The team reverted to the Mudville Nine moniker for the 2000 and 2001 seasons.

Instead of missing, he strikes the ball out of the park and wins the game.\n*An episode of the television series ''[[The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' entitled \"Return of the Nanobots\" has Cindy Vortex reciting a poem that ends with the lines: \"But there is no joy in Retroville, 'cause Jimmy is an idiot.\"\n*In the fourth season of ''[[Garfield and Friends]]'' the episode entitled \"Mind Over Matter/Orson at the Bat/Multiple Choice Cartoon\" features Wade Duck narrating a parody of the poem as Orson Pig experiences it in a dream sequence.\n*A third-season episode of ''[[Storm Chasers (TV series)|Storm Chasers]]'' was titled \"Sean Casey At Bat\".

Sheet music was published by G.

It was written in 1906, and its first known publication was in the quarterly magazine ''The Speaker'' in June 1907, under the pseudonym of James Wilson.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gardner|first=Martin|title=The Annotated Casey at the Bat: A Collection of Ballads About the Mighty Casey|year=1995|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-28598-7|page=38}}</ref> In this version, Rice cites the nickname \"Strike-Out Casey\", hence the influence on [[Casey Stengel]]'s name. Casey's team is down ''three'' runs by the last of the ninth, and once again Casey is down to two strikes\u2014with the bases full this time. However, he connects, hits the ball so far that it is never found.\n\n*In response to the popularity of the 1946 Walt Disney animated adaptation, Disney made a sequel, ''Casey Bats Again'' (1954), in which Casey's nine daughters redeem his reputation.\n*In 1988, on the 100th anniversary of the poem, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' writer [[Frank Deford]] constructed a fanciful story (later expanded to book form) which posited Katie Casey, the subject of the song \"[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]\", as being the daughter of the famous slugger from the poem.\n*In 2010, Ken Eagle wrote \"The Mudville Faithful\", covering a century of the Mudville nine's fortunes since Casey struck out. Faithful fans still root for the perpetually losing team, and are finally rewarded by a trip to the World Series, led by Casey's great-grandson who is also named Casey.\n\n===Parodies===\nOf the many [[parody|parodies]] made of the poem, some of the notable ones include:\n*''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine republished the original version of the poem in the 1950s with artwork by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]] and no alterations to the text. Later lampoons in ''Mad'' included \"'Cool' Casey at the Bat\" (1960), an interpretation of the poem in [[beatnik]] style, with artwork by [[Don Martin (cartoonist)|Don Martin]]; \"Casey at the Dice\" in 1969, about a professional gambler; \"Casey at the Talks\" in 1977, a \"modern\" version of the famed poem in which Mudville tries unsuccessfully to sign free agent Casey[the last line of which is \"Mighty Casey has held out\"]; \"Baseball at the Bat\", a satire on baseball itself, \"Howard at the Mike\", about [[Howard Stern]]; \"Casey at the Byte\" (1985), a tale of a cocky young computer expert who accidentally erases the White House Budget Plan; \"Clooney as the Bat\", a mockery of [[George Clooney]]'s role as [[Batman]] in ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman and Robin]]''; and in 2006 as \"Barry at the Bat\", poking fun at [[Barry Bonds]]' alleged involvement in the [[BALCO]] scandal, and in 2001, \"Jordan at the Hoop\", satirizing [[Michael Jordan]]'s return to the NBA and his time with the [[Washington Wizards]]. A \"Poetry Round Robin\" where famous poems are rewritten in the style of the next poet in line, featured Casey at the Bat as written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n*[[Foster Brooks]] (\"the Lovable Lush\") wrote \"Riley on the Mound\", which recounts the story from the pitcher's perspective.

Flavin performed the poem at [[Fenway Park]] during the night-long tribute to Williams done at the park later that month. The poem replaced Flynn and Blake with [[Bobby Doerr]] and [[Johnny Pesky]], the batters who preceded Williams in the 1946 Red Sox lineup.\n*In 2000, Michael J. Farrand adapted the [[rhyming scheme]], tone, and [[Literary theme|theme]] of the poem\u2014while reversing the outcome\u2014to create his poem \"The Man Who Gave All the Dreamers in Baseball Land Bigger Dreams to Dream\" about [[Kirk Gibson's 1988 World Series home run|Kirk Gibson's home run]] off [[Dennis Eckersley]] in Game 1 of the 1988 [[World Series]].

It is an acoustic wooden [[guitar]] with [[string (music)|strings]] made of gut or nylon, rather than the metal [[string (music)|strings]] used in [[acoustic guitar|acoustic]] and [[electric guitars]]. For a right-handed player, the traditional classical guitar has twelve frets clear of the body and is properly held on the left leg, so that the hand that plucks or strums the strings does so near the back of the sound hole (this is called the classical position). The modern steel string guitar, on the other hand, usually has fourteen frets clear of the body (see [[Dreadnought (guitar type)|Dreadnought]]) and is commonly played off the hip.\n\nThe phrase \"classical guitar\" may refer to either of two concepts other than the instrument itself:\n*the instrumental finger technique common to classical guitar\u2014individual strings plucked with the fingernails or, rarely, fingertips.\n*the instrument's classical music repertoire\n\nThe term ''modern classical guitar'' is sometimes used to distinguish the classical guitar from older forms of guitar, which are in their broadest sense also called ''classical'', or more specifically, ''early guitars''. Examples of early guitars include the six-string early romantic guitar (c. 1790\u20131880), and the earlier baroque guitars with five [[Course (music)|courses]].\n\nThe materials and the methods of classical guitar construction may vary, but the typical shape is either ''modern classical guitar'' or that ''historic classical guitar'' similar to the early romantic guitars of France and Italy. [[Classical guitar strings]] once made of [[catgut|gut]] are now made of such polymers as [[nylon]], with fine wire wound about the acoustically lower (bass side) strings.\n\nA guitar family tree may be identified. The [[flamenco guitar]] derives from the modern classical, but has differences in material, construction and sound.<ref>[http://www.fernandezmusic.com/Flamencovsclassical.html Classical vs. Flamenco Guitar Construction] (Fernandez Music)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.zavaletas-guitarras.com/files/faq.htm#What%20are%20the%20differences%20between%20a%20classical%20and%20a%20flamenco%20guitar?|title = FAQ about Classical Guitars and Flamenco Guitars|publisher = Zavaleta's La Casa de Guitarras\n}}</ref>\n\nToday's ''modern classical guitar'' was established by the late designs of the 19th-century Spanish [[luthier]], [[Antonio Torres Jurado]].\n\n==Contexts==\nThe classical guitar has a long history and one is able to distinguish various:\n*[[Musical instrument|instruments]]\n*[[Musical repertoire|repertoire]] (composers and their compositions, [[arrangement]]s, improvisations)\n\nBoth instrument and repertoire can be viewed from a combination of various perspectives:\n\n'''Historical''' (chronological period of time)\n*[[Baroque guitar]] \u2013  1600 to 1750 CE\n*[[romantic guitar|Early romantic guitars]] \u2013  1750 to 1850 CE (for music from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] periods)\n*Modern classical guitars\n'''Geographical'''\n*Spanish guitars ([[Antonio Torres Jurado|Torres]]) and French guitars (Ren\u00e9 Lac\u00f4te,&nbsp;...), etc.\n'''Cultural'''\n*Baroque court music, 19th century opera and its influences, 19th century folk songs, Latin American music\n\n==Historical perspective==\n{{Main article|History of the classical guitar}}\n\n===Early guitars===\n[[File:Musee-de-la-musique-6.jpg|thumb|200px|right|alt=Guitars from the Museum Cit\u00e9 de la Musique in Paris|Guitars from the Museum [[Cit\u00e9 de la Musique]] in Paris (which houses almost 200 classical guitars<ref name=cite>Cit\u00e9 de la Musique: [http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/MediaComposite/CMDM/CMDM000000700/guitare_musee_00.htm Les guitares classiques du Mus\u00e9e de la musique (almost 200 classical guitars)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313073529/http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/mediacomposite/cmdm/cmdm000000700/guitare_musee_00.htm |date=2010-03-13 }};&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/masc/?INSTANCE=CITEMUSIQUE&URL=/clientbooklineCIMU/toolkit/p_requests/FSFormulaire.asp?GRILLE=CIMUINSTRUMENTAVANCEE_0&TYPEMENU=catalogue-instrumentoeuvre-bandeau.asp?TYPESOUSMENU=2 Catalog: Instruments et oeuvres d'art]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725002715/http://mediatheque.cite-musique.fr/masc/?INSTANCE=CITEMUSIQUE&URL=%2FclientbooklineCIMU%2Ftoolkit%2Fp_requests%2FFSFormulaire.asp%3FGRILLE%3DCIMUINSTRUMENTAVANCEE_0&TYPEMENU=catalogue-instrumentoeuvre-bandeau.asp%3FTYPESOUSMENU%3D2 |date=July 25, 2009 }} - use search-phrase: Mot-cl\u00e9(s) : ''guitare''</ref>)]]\nWhile \"classical guitar\" is today mainly associated with the modern classical guitar design, there is an increasing interest in early guitars; and understanding the link between historical repertoire and the particular period guitar that was originally used to perform this repertoire. The musicologist and author Graham Wade writes:\n\n<blockquote>Nowadays it is customary to play this repertoire on reproductions of instruments authentically modelled on concepts of musicological research with appropriate adjustments to techniques and overall interpretation. Thus over recent decades we have become accustomed to specialist artists with expertise in the art of vihuela (a 16th-century type of guitar popular in Spain), lute, Baroque guitar, 19th-century guitar, etc.<ref name=\"visee\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.111092&catNum=8111092&filetype=About%20this%20Recording&language=English|title= SEGOVIA, Andres: 1950s American Recordings, Vol. 4|publisher=Graham Wade}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nDifferent types of guitars have different sound aesthetics, e.g. different colour-spectrum characteristics (the way the sound energy is spread in the fundamental frequency and the [[overtones]]), different response, etc. These differences are due to differences in construction; for example modern classical guitars usually use a different bracing (fan-bracing) from that used in earlier guitars (they had ladder-bracing); and a different voicing was used by the luthier.\n\nThere is a historical parallel between musical styles (baroque, classical, romantic, flamenco, jazz) and the style of \"sound aesthetic\" of the musical instruments used, for example: [[Robert de Vis\u00e9e]] played a baroque guitar with a very different sound aesthetic from the guitars used by [[Mauro Giuliani]] and [[Luigi Legnani]] \u2013 they used 19th century guitars. These guitars in turn sound different from the Torres models used by Segovia that are suited for interpretations of romantic-modern works such as [[Federico Moreno Torroba|Moreno Torroba]].\n\nWhen considering the guitar from a historical perspective, the musical instrument used is as important as the musical language and style of the particular period. As an example: It is impossible to play a historically informed de Visee or Corbetta (baroque guitarist-composers) on a modern classical guitar. The reason is that the baroque guitar used courses, which are two strings close together (in unison), that are plucked together. This gives baroque guitars an unmistakable sound characteristic and tonal texture that is an integral part of an interpretation. Additionally the sound aesthetic of the baroque guitar (with its strong overtone presence) is very different from modern classical type guitars, as is shown below.\n\nToday's use of Torres and post-Torres type guitars for repertoire of all periods is sometimes critically viewed: Torres and post-Torres style modern guitars (with their fan-bracing and design) have a thick and strong tone, very suitable for modern-era repertoire. However, they are considered to emphasize the fundamental too heavily (at the expense of overtone partials) for earlier repertoire (Classical/Romantic: Carulli, Sor, Giuliani, Mertz,&nbsp;...; Baroque: de Visee,&nbsp;...; etc.). \"Andr\u00e9s Segovia presented the Spanish guitar as a versatile model for all playing styles\"<ref name=\"earlyromanticguitar.com\"/> to the extent, that still today, \"many guitarists have tunnel-vision of the world of the guitar, coming from the modern Segovia tradition\".<ref>[http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com/erg/periodtechnique.htm Early Romantic Guitar Period Technique] by earlyromanticguitar.com</ref>\n\nWhile fan-braced modern classical Torres and post-Torres style instruments coexisted with traditional ladder-braced guitars at the beginning of the 20th century, the traditional forms eventually fell away. Some attribute this to the popularity of [[Andr\u00e9s Segovia|Segovia]], considering him \"the catalyst for change toward the Spanish design and the so-called 'modern' school in the 1920s and beyond.\"<ref name=\"earlyromanticguitar.com\">[http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com/erg/timeperiod.htm Early Classical Guitar and Early Romantic Guitar Time Period] by earlyromanticguitar.com</ref> The styles of music performed on ladder-braced guitars were becoming more and more unfashionable; and, e.g. in Germany, musicians were in part turning towards folk music (Schrammel-music and the [[Contraguitar]]), but this only remained localized in Germany and Austria and became unfashionable again. On the other hand, Segovia was playing in concerts around the world, popularizing his modern classical guitar, as well as a new style of music in the 1920s: Spanish romantic-modern style with guitar works by Moreno Torroba, de Falla, etc. Some people consider it to have been this influence of Segovia which led to the domination of the Torres instrument. Factories all over the world began producing them in large numbers.\n\nIt was the 19th century classical guitarist [[Francisco T\u00e1rrega]] who first popularized the Torres design as a classical solo instrument.\n\n====Characteristics====\n*Vihuela, renaissance guitars and baroque guitars have a bright sound, rich in overtones, and their courses (double strings) give the sound a very particular texture.\n*Early guitars of the classical and romantic period (early romantic guitars) have single strings, but their design and voicing are still such that they have their tonal energy more in the overtones (but without starved fundamental), giving a bright intimate tone.\n*Later in Spain a style of music emerged that favored a stronger fundamental:<br />\"With the change of music a stronger fundamental was demanded and the fan bracing system was approached.&nbsp;... the guitar tone has been changed from a transparent tone, rich in higher partials to a more 'broad' tone with a strong fundamental.\"<ref>[http://www.speech.kth.se/music/publications/kma/papers/kma38-ocr.pdf Function, Construction and Quality of the Guitar]; 1983</ref>\n*Thus modern guitars with fan bracing (fan strutting) have a design and voicing that gives them a thick, heavy sound, with far more tonal energy found in the fundamental.\n\n==Style periods==\n\n===Renaissance===\nComposers of the Renaissance period who wrote for four course guitar include [[Alonso Mudarra]], [[Miguel de Fuenllana]], [[Adrian Le Roy]], [[Gregoire Brayssing]], [[Guillaume de Morlaye]], and [[Simon Golier]].\n;Instrument\nFour-course guitar\n\n===Baroque===\nSome well known composers of the baroque guitar were [[Gaspar Sanz]], [[Robert de Vis\u00e9e]] and [[Francesco Corbetta]].\n;Examples of instruments\n*Baroque guitar by [[Nicholas Alexandre Voboam II|Nicolas Alexandre Voboam II]]: This French instrument has the typical design of the period with five courses of double-strings and a flat back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/search_art.asp?recview=true&id=51471&coll_keywords=&coll_accession=&coll_name=&coll_artist=&coll_place=&coll_medium=&coll_culture=&coll_classification=&coll_credit=&coll_provenance=&coll_location=&coll_has_images=&coll_on_view=&coll_sort=0&coll_sort_order=0&coll_view=0&coll_package=10095&coll_start=11|title=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: Collection Search Results|author=|date=|website=mfa.org|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n*Baroque guitar attributed to Matteo Sellas : This Italian instrument has five courses and a rounded back.<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/collection_database/musical_instruments/guitar_matteo_sellas/objectview.aspx?page=2&sort=0&sortdir=asc&keyword=guitar&fp=1&dd1=18&dd2=0&vw=1&collID=18&OID=180015154&vT=1 ref Guitar | Matteo Sellas|All|Musical Instruments]</ref>\n\n===Classical and Romantic===\nFrom approximately 1780 to 1850, the guitar had numerous composers and performers including: \n*[[Filippo Gragnani]] (1767\u20131820)\n*[[Antoine de Lhoyer]] (1768\u20131852)\n*[[Ferdinando Carulli]] (1770\u20131841)\n*[[Francesco Molino]] (1774\u20131847)\n*[[Fernando Sor]] (1778\u20131839)\n*Luigi Moretti (c. 1780\u20131850)\n*[[Mauro Giuliani]] (1781\u20131829)\n*[[Niccol\u00f2 Paganini]] (1782\u20131840)\n*[[Dionisio Aguado]] (1784 \u2013 1849)\n*[[Luigi Legnani]] (1790\u20131877)\n*[[Matteo Carcassi]] (1792\u20131853)\n*[[Napol\u00e9on Coste]] (1805\u20131883)\n*[[Johann Kaspar Mertz]] (1806\u20131856)\n\n[[Hector Berlioz]] studied the guitar as a teenager,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hberlioz.com/LaCote/BerliozLacote.html|title=The Hector Berlioz Website - La C\u00f4te Saint-Andr\u00e9 Berlioz\u2019s birthplace|author=|date=|website=www.hberlioz.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> [[Franz Schubert]] owned at least two and wrote for the instrument,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacaranda-music.com/Schubert.html|title=The myth of Schubert and the Guitar, An article seeking to clarify what relationship Schubert may - or may not - have had with the guitar|author=|date=|website=www.jacaranda-music.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], after hearing Giuliani play, commented the instrument was \"a miniature orchestra in itself\".<ref>A.

Do not understand me wrong, we have many guitarists today that are very excellent performers, but none with such a distinct personality in their tone and style as Llobet, Segovia and Bream. In all instrumental areas, not just the guitar, there is a lack of individualism with a strong tendency to conformity.

This means that the contemporary Iranian instruments such as the [[tanbur]] and [[setar]] are distantly related to the European guitar, as they all derive ultimately from the same ancient origins, but by very different historical routes and influences.\n\nDuring the late [[Middle Ages]], [[gittern]]s called \"guitars\" were in use, but their construction and tuning was different from modern guitars. The ''[[Guitarra latina|Guitarra Latina]]'' in Spain, had curved sides and a single hole. The ''[[Guitarra morisca|Guitarra Morisca]]'', which appears to have had [[Moorish]] influences, had an oval soundbox and many sound holes on its soundboard. By the 15th century, a four course double-string instrument called the [[vihuela de mano]], that had tuning like the later modern guitar except on one string and similar construction, first appeared in Spain and spread to France and Italy. In the 16th century, a fifth double-string was added. During this time, composers wrote mostly in tablature notation. In the middle of the 16th century, influences from the vihuela and the renaissance guitar were combined and the baroque five string guitar appeared in Spain.<ref>\"The first incontrovertible evidence of five-course instruments can be found in Miguel Fuenllana's Orphenica Lyre of 1554, which contains music for a vihuela de cinco ordenes. In the following year Juan Bermudo wrote in his Declaracion de Instrumentos Musicales: \"We have seen a guitar in Spain with five courses of strings.\" Bermudo later mentions in the same book that \"Guitars usually have four strings,\" which implies that the five-course guitar was of comparatively recent origin, and still something of an oddity\".

In the late 18th century the six string guitar quickly became popular at the expense of the five string guitars. During the 19th century the Spanish luthier and player [[Antonio de Torres]] gave the modern classical guitar its definitive form, with a broadened body, increased waist curve, thinned belly, improved internal bracing.<ref>The guitars built by Antonio de Torres still had friction pegs (see for example Richard Chapman \"The New Complete Guitarist\", p. 13 top)</ref> The modern classical guitar replaced an older form for the accompaniment of song and dance called [[flamenco]], and a modified version, known as the [[flamenco guitar]], was created.\n\n{{multiple image |direction=vertical |width=200\n | image1   = Wartburg-Laute.JPG\n | caption1 = [[Gittern]] (1450)\n | image2   = Vihuela - Frontispiece Libro de m\u00fasica de vihuela de mano intitulado El maestro by Luis Milan.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Vihuela]]<br/>(<!-- clipped from front piece of -->vihuela book by Luis Milan, 1536<ref>\n   {{cite web\n   | author     = Luis Milan\n   | year       = 1536\n   | title      = Libro de m\u00fasica de vihuela de mano intitulado El maestro\n   }}</ref>)\n | image3   = Baroque Guitar Etienne Picart (1680).jpg\n | caption3 = [[Baroque guitar]]<ref>\n   {{cite web\n   | author     = Alexander Batov\n   | date       = 20 April 2006\n   | title      = The Royal College Dias - guitar or vihuela?\n   | url        = http://www.vihuelademano.com/rcmdias.htm \n   | work       = (The talk given at the Lute Society meeting in London on 16 April 2005)\n   | quote      = ''A rather small sized vaulted-back guitar in the engraving by Etienne Picart (c. 1680) after the painting by Leonello Spada Concert (c.1615), Mus\u00e9e du Louvre, Paris''\n   }}</ref> with rounded-back<br/> (engraving by Etienne Picart, 1680)\n}}\n\n===Renaissance guitar===\n{{see also|Renaissance music}}\n[[Alonso de Mudarra]]'s book ''Tres Libros de M\u00fasica'', published in Spain in 1546, contains the earliest known written pieces for a four-course guitarra. This four-course \"guitar\" was popular in France, Spain, and Italy. In France this instrument gained popularity among aristocrats. A considerable volume of music was published in Paris from the 1550s to the 1570s: [[Simon Gorlier]]'s Le Troysi\u00e8me Livre... mis en tablature de Guiterne was published in 1551. In 1551 [[Adrian Le Roy]] also published his Premier Livre de Tablature de Guiterne, and in the same year he also published Briefve et facile instruction pour apprendre la tablature a bien accorder, conduire, et disposer la main sur la Guiterne. Robert Ballard, Gr\u00e9goire Brayssing from Augsburg, and Guillaume Morlaye (c. 1510 \u2013 c. 1558) significantly contributed to its repertoire. Morlaye's Le Premier Livre de Chansons, Gaillardes, Pavannes, Bransles, Almandes, Fantasies \u2013 which has a four-course instrument illustrated on its title page \u2013 was published in partnership with Michel Fedenzat, and among other music, they published six books of tablature by lutenist Albert de Rippe (who was very likely Guillaume's teacher).\n\n===Vihuela===\n{{Main article|Vihuela}}\n\nThe written history of the classical guitar can be traced back to the early 16th century with the development of the ''[[vihuela]]'' in Spain. While the lute was then becoming popular in other parts of Europe, the Spaniards did not take to it well because of its association with the Moors.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Instead, the lute-like vihuela appeared with two more strings that gave it more range and complexity. In its most developed form, the vihuela was a guitar-like instrument with six double strings made of gut, tuned like a modern classical guitar with the exception of the third string, which was tuned half a step lower. It has a high sound and is rather large to hold. Few have survived and most of what is known today comes from diagrams and paintings.\n\n<!-- [[Image:Jan Vermeer van Delft 013.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Guitar Player (c. 1672), by [[Johannes Vermeer]], guitar Voboam]] -->\n{{multiple image |direction=horizontal\n<!--\n | image1   = M2676 - gitarr - Matteo Seelos - f\u00f6re 1653 - foto Olav Nyhus.jpg\n | caption1 = Baroque guitar by Matteo Seelos (c.1653)\n | width1   = 160\n-->\n | image1   = Jan Vermeer van Delft 013.jpg\n | caption1 = [[Baroque guitar]] on ''The Guitar Player'' (c. 1672), by [[Johannes Vermeer]]<!-- , guitar Voboam -->\n | width1   = 137\n | image2   = Jean-Nicolas Grobert - Early Romantic Guitar, Paris around 1830.jpg\n | caption2 = [[Early romantic guitar]] by Jean-Nicolas Grobert (1830)\n | width2   = 103\n}}\n\n===Baroque guitar===\n{{Main article|Baroque guitar}}\n{{see also|Baroque music}}\n\n===\"Early romantic guitar\" or \"Guitar during the Classical music era\"===\n{{Main article|Early romantic guitar}}\n{{See also|Classical music era}}\n\nThe earliest extant six-string guitar is believed to have been built in 1779 by [[Gaetano Vinaccia]] (1759 - after 1831)  in [[Naples]], [[Italy]]; however, the date on the label is a little ambiguous.<ref>''The Classical Mandolin'' by Paul Sparks (1995)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earlyromanticguitar.com/|title=Early Romantic Guitar Homepage|author=|date=|website=www.earlyromanticguitar.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> The Vinaccia family of luthiers is known for developing the [[mandolin]].

Alternatively - if a footstool is not used - a ''guitar support'' can be placed between the guitar and the left lap (the support usually attaches to the instrument's side with [[suction cup]]s). (There are of course exceptions, with some performers choosing to hold the instrument another way.)\n\nRight-handed players use the fingers of the right hand to pluck the strings, with the thumb plucking from the top of a string downwards (downstroke) and the other fingers plucking from the bottom of string upwards (upstroke). The little finger in classical technique as it evolved in the 20th century is used only to ride along with the ring finger without striking the strings and to thus physiologically facilitate the ring finger's motion.\n\nIn contrast, [[Flamenco]] technique, and classical compositions evoking Flamenco, employ the little finger semi-independently in the Flamenco four-finger [[rasgueado]], that rapid strumming of the string by the fingers in reverse order employing the back of the fingernail&mdash;a familiar characteristic of Flamenco.\n\n[[Flamenco]] technique, in the performance of the [[rasgueado]] also uses the upstroke of the four fingers and the downstroke of the thumb: the string is hit not only with the inner, fleshy side of the fingertip but also with the outer, fingernail side. This was also used in a technique of the [[vihuela]] called [[dedillo]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ralphmaier.com/index_files/Page318.htm|title=Mastering the Dedillo|author=|date=|website=ralphmaier.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> which has recently begun to be introduced on the classical guitar.\n\nSome modern guitarists, such as [[\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n Rak]] and [[Kazuhito Yamashita]], use the little finger independently, compensating for the little finger's shortness by maintaining an extremely long fingernail.\n\n[[\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n Rak]] and [[Kazuhito Yamashita]] have also generalized the use of the upstroke of the four fingers and the downstroke of the thumb (the same technique as in the [[rasgueado]] of the [[Flamenco]]: as explained above the string is hit not only with the inner, fleshy side of the fingertip but also with the outer, fingernail side) both as a free stroke and as a rest stroke.<ref>[http://www.egta.co.uk/content/rakinterview A 1992 interview of \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n Rak by Graham Wade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530073212/http://www.egta.co.uk/content/rakinterview |date=2013-05-30 }}</ref>\n\n===Direct contact with strings===\nAs with other plucked instruments (such as the lute), the musician directly touches the strings (usually plucking) to produce the sound. This has important consequences: Different tone/[[timbre]] (of a single note) can be produced by plucking the string in different manners and in different positions. For example, plucking an open string will sound brighter than playing the same note(s) on a fretted position (which would have a warmer tone).\n\nThe instrument's versatility means it can create a variety of tones, but this also makes the instrument harder to learn than a standard acoustic guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nationalguitaracademy.com/classical-guitar-lessons/|title=Classical Guitar Lessons|author=|date=30 May 2016|website=nationalguitaracademy.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fingering notation=== <!--This section should be moved to the Classical guitar technique article BUT AS LONG AS the Alternation subsection is here this section about marking of fingerings needs ALSO to stay here in order for the reader to be able to make sense of the fingerings used in the following subsection-->\n\nIn guitar ''scores'' the five fingers of the right-hand (which pluck the strings) are designated by the first letter of their Spanish names namely p = thumb (''pulgar''), i = index finger (''\u00edndice''), m = middle finger (''mayor''), a = ring finger (''anular''), c = little finger or pinky (''me\u00f1ique/chiquito'')<ref>The little finger whose use is not completely standardized in classical guitar technique can also be found designated by e or x. There are several words in Spanish for the little finger: dedo me\u00f1ique, dedo auricular, dedo peque\u00f1o, but their initials conflict with the initials of the other fingers; c is said to be the initial of the dedo chiquito which is not the most common name for the little finger; e and x are not initials but letters that were picked, either with its own rationale, by people who didn't know what else to pick</ref>\n\nThe four fingers of the left hand (which stop the strings) are designated 1 = index, 2 = major, 3 = ring finger, 4 = little finger; 0 designates an open string, that is a string that is not stopped by a finger of the left hand and whose full length thus vibrates when plucked. On the classical guitar thumb of the left hand is never used to stop strings from above (as is done on the electric guitar): the neck of a classical guitar is too wide and the normal position of the thumb used in classical guitar technique do not make that possible.\n\nScores (contrary to ''tablatures'') do not systematically indicate the string to be plucked (although in most cases the choice is obvious). When an indication of the string is required the strings are designated 1 to 6 (from the 1st the high E to the 6th the low E) with figures 1 to 6 inside circles.\n\nThe positions (that is where on the fretboard the first finger of the left hand is placed) are also not systematically indicated, but when they are (mostly in the case of the execution of ''barr\u00e9s'') these are indicated with Roman numerals from the first position I (index finger of the left hand placed on the 1st fret: F-B flat-E flat-A flat-C-F) to the twelfth position XII (the index finger of the left hand placed on the 12th fret: E-A-D-G-B-E; the 12th fret is placed where the body begins) or even higher up to position XIX (the classical guitar most often having 19 frets, with the 19th fret being most often split and not being usable to fret the 3rd and 4th strings).\n\n===Alternation=== <!--This section should be moved to the Classical guitar technique article; it is too detailed for the general information the section Performance deals with in the context of this article which is a general introduction to the Classical guitar-->\nTo achieve tremolo effects and rapid, fluent scale passages, the player must practice alternation, that is, never plucking a string with the same finger twice in a row. \nUsing '''p''' to indicate the thumb, '''i''' the index finger, '''m''' the middle finger and '''a''' the ring finger, common alternation patterns include:\n* ''i-m-i-m'' : Basic melody line on the treble strings. Has the appearance of \"walking along the strings\".\n* ''p-i-m-a-i-m-a'' : Arpeggio pattern with a sextuplet feel (i.e. usually played on across five different strings).\n* ''p-a-m-i-p-a-m-i'' : Another tremolo pattern.\n* ''p-m-p-m'' : A way of playing a melody line on the lower strings.\n\n==Repertoire==\n{{main article|classical guitar repertoire}}\nMusic written specifically for the classical guitar dates from the addition of the sixth string (the baroque guitar normally had five pairs of strings) in the late 18th century.\n\nA guitar recital may include a variety of works, e.g. works written originally for the lute or vihuela by composers such as [[John Dowland]] (b. England 1563) and [[Luis de Narv\u00e1ez]] (b. Spain c. 1500), and also music written for the harpsichord by [[Domenico Scarlatti]] (b. Italy 1685), for the baroque lute by [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]] (b. Germany 1687), for the baroque guitar by [[Robert de Vis\u00e9e]] (b. France c. 1650) or even Spanish-flavored music written for the piano by [[Isaac Alb\u00e9niz]] (b. Spain 1860) and [[Enrique Granados]] (b. Spain 1867). The most important composer who did not write for the guitar but whose music is often played on it is [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (b. Germany 1685), whose baroque lute works have proved highly adaptable to the instrument.\n\nOf music written originally for guitar, the earliest important composers are from the classical period and include [[Fernando Sor]] (b. Spain 1778) and [[Mauro Giuliani]] (b. Italy 1781), both of whom wrote in a style strongly influenced by Viennese classicism. In the 19th century guitar composers such as [[Johann Kaspar Mertz]] (b. Slovakia, Austria 1806) were strongly influenced by the dominance of the piano. Not until the end of the nineteenth century did the guitar begin to establish its own unique identity. [[Francisco T\u00e1rrega]] (b. Spain 1852) was central to this, sometimes incorporating stylized aspects of flamenco's Moorish influences into his romantic miniatures. <!-- This created the erroneous impression that T\u00e1rrega and flamenco (including rasgueado) went hand in hand; in fact T\u00e1rrega rarely used rasgueado. Angel Barrios (1882\u20131964) is an important figure in the fusion of \"classical guitar\" (as a salon instrument) and \"flamenco guitar\" (as an instrument to accompany flamenco song and dance). --> This was part of late 19th century mainstream European musical nationalism. Alb\u00e9niz and Granados were central to this movement; their evocation of the guitar was so successful that their compositions have been absorbed into standard guitar repertoire.\n\nThe steel-string and electric guitars characteristic to the rise of rock and roll in the post-WWII era became more widely played in North America and the English speaking world. Barrios composed many works and brought into the mainstream the characteristics of Latin American music, as did the Brazilian composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]]. Andr\u00e9s Segovia commissioned works from Spanish composers such as [[Federico Moreno Torroba]] and [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]], Italians such as [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]] and Latin American composers such as [[Manuel Ponce (composer)|Manuel Ponce]] of Mexico. Other prominent Latin American composers are [[Leo Brouwer]] of Cuba, [[Antonio Lauro]] of Venezuela and [[Enrique Solares]] of Guatemala. [[Julian Bream]] of Britain managed to get nearly every British composer from [[William Walton]] to [[Benjamin Britten]] to [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] to write significant works for guitar. Bream's collaborations with tenor [[Peter Pears]] also resulted in [[song cycles]] by Britten, [[Lennox Berkeley]] and others. There are significant works by composers such as [[Hans Werner Henze]] of Germany, [[Gilbert Biberian]] of England and [[Roland Chadwick]] of Australia.\n\nThe classical guitar also became widely used in popular music and rock & roll in the 1960s after guitarist [[Mason Williams]] popularized the instrument in his instrumental hit [[Classical Gas]].<!--&nbsp;... and left only this one, which without the previous one did not make any sense! --> Guitarist [[Christopher Parkening]] is quoted in the book ''Classical Gas: The Music of Mason Williams'' as saying that it is the most requested guitar piece besides Malague\u00f1a and perhaps the best known instrumental guitar piece today.\nIn the field of [[New Flamenco]], the works and performances of Spanish composer and player [[Paco de Luc\u00eda]] are known worldwide.\n\nNot many classical guitar concertos were written through the guitar history. Nevertheless, some guitar concertos are nowadays wide known and popular, especially [[Joaqu\u00edn Rodrigo]]'s ''[[Concierto de Aranjuez]]'' (with the famous theme from 2nd movement) and ''[[Fantas\u00eda para un gentilhombre]]''. Composers, who also wrote famous guitar concertos are: [[Antonio Vivaldi]] (originally for mandolin or lute), [[Mauro Giuliani]], [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]], [[Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco]], [[Manuel Ponce]], [[Leo Brouwer]], [[Lennox Berkeley]]... \nNowadays, more and more contemporary composers decide to write a guitar concerto.\n\n==Physical characteristics==\nThe classical guitar is distinguished by a number of characteristics:\n*It is an [[wiktionary:acoustic|acoustic]] instrument. The sound of the plucked string is amplified by the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]] and resonant cavity of the guitar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/music/guitar/|title=Guitar acoustics|author=|date=|website=www.phys.unsw.edu.au|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n*It has six [[string (music)|strings]], though some classical guitars have seven or more strings.\n*All six strings are made from [[nylon]], or nylon wrapped with metal, as opposed to the metal strings found on other acoustic guitars. Nylon strings also have a much lower [[Tension (mechanics)|tension]] than steel strings, as do the predecessors to nylon strings, gut strings (made from ox or sheep gut). The lower three strings ('bass strings') are wound with metal, commonly silver-plated copper.\n*Because of the low string tension\n** The neck can be made entirely of wood without a steel truss rod\n** The interior bracing can be lighter\n*Typical modern six-string classical guitars are 48\u201354&nbsp;mm wide at the nut, compared to around 42&nbsp;mm for electric guitars.\n* Classical fingerboards are normally flat and without inlaid fret markers, or just have dot inlays on the side of the neck&mdash;steel string fingerboards usually have a slight radius and inlays.\n*Classical guitarists use their right hand to pluck the strings. Players shape their fingernails for ideal tone and feel against the strings.\n*Strumming is a less common technique in classical guitar, and is often referred to by the Spanish term \"rasgueo,\" or for strumming patterns \"rasgueado,\" and uses the backs of the fingernails. Rasgueado is integral to [[Flamenco]] guitar.\n*[[Machine head]]s at the [[headstock]] of a classical guitar point backwards&mdash;in contrast to most steel-string guitars, which have machine heads that point outward.\n*The overall design of a Classical Guitar is very similar to the slightly lighter and smaller [[Flamenco guitar]].\n\n===Parts===\n[[Image:Acoustic guitar-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.3]]\n\n<div class=\"thumbcaption\">Parts of typical classical guitars, numbered<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frets.com/FRETSPages/General/Glossary/glossary.html|title=Fretted instrument terminology: An Illustrated Glossary|author=|date=|website=frets.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref></div>\n\n: '''1''' [[Headstock]]\n: '''2''' Nut\n: '''3''' [[Machine head]]s (or pegheads, tuning keys, tuning machines, tuners)\n: '''4''' [[Fret]]s\n: '''7''' Neck\n: '''8''' Heel\n: '''9''' Body\n: '''12''' Bridge\n: '''14''' Bottom deck\n: '''15''' Soundboard\n: '''16''' Body sides\n: '''17''' [[Sound hole]], with [[rosette (design)|rosette]] inlay\n: '''18''' [[Classical guitar strings|Strings]]\n: '''19''' Saddle (Bridge nut)\n: '''20''' Fretboard\n\n====Fretboard====\nThe fretboard (also called the '''fingerboard''') is a piece of wood embedded with metal frets that constitutes the top of the neck. It is flat or slightly curved. The curvature of the fretboard is measured by the fretboard radius, which is the radius of a hypothetical circle of which the fretboard's surface constitutes a segment. The smaller the fretboard radius, the more noticeably curved the fretboard is. Fretboards are most commonly made of [[ebony]], but may also be made of [[Rosewood (timber)|rosewood]] or of phenolic composite (\"micarta\").\n\n====Frets====\n{{Main article|Fret}}\n\nFrets are the metal strips (usually nickel alloy or stainless steel) embedded along the [[fingerboard]] and placed at points that divide the length of string mathematically. The strings' vibrating length is determined when the strings are pressed down behind the frets. Each fret produces a different pitch and each pitch spaced a half-step apart on the 12 tone scale. The [[ratio]] of the widths of two consecutive frets is the [[twelfth root of two]] (<math>\\sqrt[12]{2}</math>), whose numeric value is about 1.059463. The twelfth fret divides the string in two exact halves and the 24th fret (if present) divides the string in half yet again. Every twelve frets represents one octave. This arrangement of frets results in [[equal temperament|equal tempered]] tuning.\n\n====Neck====\n{{Main article|Guitar neck}}\n{{see also|Guitar strings}}\nA classical guitar's frets, fretboard, tuners, headstock, all attached to a long wooden extension, collectively constitute its [[neck (music)|neck]]. The wood for the fretboard usually differs from the wood in the rest of the neck. The bending stress on the neck is considerable, particularly when heavier gauge strings are used.\n\n====Neck joint or 'heel'====\nThis is the point where the neck meets the body. In the traditional Spanish neck joint the neck and block are one piece with the sides inserted into slots cut in the block. Other necks are built separately and joined to the body either with a dovetail joint, mortise or flush joint. These joints are usually glued and can be reinforced with mechanical fasteners. Recently many manufacturers use bolt on fasteners. Bolt on neck joints were once associated only with less expensive instruments but now some top manufacturers and hand builders are using variations of this method. Some people believed that the Spanish style one piece neck/block and glued dovetail necks have better sustain, but testing has failed to confirm this.\nWhile most traditional Spanish style builders use the one piece neck/heel block, Fleta, a prominent Spanish builder, used a dovetail joint due to the influence of his early training in violin making.\nOne reason for the introduction of the mechanical joints was to make it easier to repair necks. This is more of a problem with steel string guitars than with nylon strings, which have about half the string tension. This is why nylon string guitars often don't include a truss rod either.\n\n====Body====\nThe body of the instrument is a major determinant of the overall sound variety for acoustic guitars. The guitar top, or soundboard, is a finely crafted and engineered element often made of [[spruce]], [[Thuja plicata|red cedar]], [[Sequoia sempervirens|redwood]] or [[mahogany]]. This thin (often 2 or 3&nbsp;mm thick) piece of wood, strengthened by different types of internal bracing, is considered the most prominent factor in determining the sound quality of a guitar. The majority of the sound is caused by vibration of the guitar top as the energy of the vibrating strings is transferred to it. Different patterns of wood bracing have been used through the years by luthiers ([[Antonio Torres Jurado|Torres]], [[Hermann Hauser Sr.|Hauser]], [[Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00edrez (luthier)|Ram\u00edrez]], Fleta, and [[C.F. Martin & Company|C.F. Martin]] being among the most influential designers of their times); to not only strengthen the top against collapsing under the tremendous stress exerted by the tensioned strings, but also to affect the resonation of the top. Some contemporary guitar makers have introduced new construction concepts such as \"double-top\" consisting of two extra-thin wooden plates separated by [[Nomex]], or carbon-fiber reinforced lattice - pattern bracing. The back and sides are made out of a variety of woods such as mahogany, Indian [[rosewood]] and highly regarded Brazilian rosewood (''Dalbergia nigra''). Each one is chosen for its aesthetic effect and structural strength, and such choice can also play a significant role in determining the instrument's [[timbre]]. These are also strengthened with internal bracing, and decorated with inlays and purfling.\n\nThe body of a classical guitar is a resonating chamber that projects the vibrations of the body through a ''sound hole'', allowing the acoustic guitar to be heard without amplification. The sound hole is normally a single round hole in the top of the guitar (under the strings), though some have different placement, shapes, or numbers of holes. How much air an instrument can move determines its maximum volume.\n\n====Binding, purfling and kerfing====\nThe top, back and sides of a classical guitar body are very thin, so a flexible piece of wood called ''kerfing'' (because it is often scored, or ''kerfed'' so it bends with the shape of the rim) is glued into the corners where the rim meets the top and back. This interior reinforcement provides 5 to 20&nbsp;mm of solid gluing area for these corner joints.\n\nDuring final construction, a small section of the outside corners is carved or routed out and filled with binding material on the outside corners and decorative strips of material next to the binding, which are called ''[[purfling]]''. This binding serves to seal off the [[endgrain]] of the top and back. Binding and purfling materials are generally made of either wood or high quality plastic materials.\n\n====Bridge====\nThe main purpose of the bridge on a classical guitar is to transfer the vibration from the strings to the soundboard, which vibrates the air inside of the guitar, thereby amplifying the sound produced by the strings. The bridge holds the strings in place on the body. Also, the position of the saddle, usually a strip of bone or plastic that supports the strings off the bridge, determines the distance to the nut (at the top of the fingerboard).\n\n===Sizes===\nThe modern full size classical guitar has a [[Scale (string instruments)|scale length]]<ref>[http://www.hago.org.uk/faqs/scale-length.php Guitar scale length] Hampshire guitar orchestra</ref> of around {{convert|650|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with an overall instrument length of {{convert|965|\u2013|1016|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The scale length has remained quite consistent since it was chosen by the originator of the instrument, [[Antonio Torres Jurado|Antonio de Torres]]. This length may have been chosen because it's twice the length of a violin string. As the guitar is tuned to one octave below that of the violin, the same size gut could be used for the first strings of both instruments.\n\nSmaller-scale instruments are produced to assist children in learning the instrument as the smaller scale leads to the frets being closer together, making it easier for smaller hands. The scale-size for the smaller guitars is usually in the range {{convert|484|\u2013|578|mm|in|abbr=on}}, with an instrument length of {{convert|785|\u2013|915|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Full-size instruments are sometimes referred to as 4/4, while the smaller sizes are 3/4, 1/2 or 1/4.\n\nThese sizes are not absolute, as [[luthier]]s may choose variations around these nominal scale-lengths;\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-4}}\n;* 4/4 650&nbsp;mm (25.6&nbsp;inches)\n{{Col-4}}\n;* 3/4 578&nbsp;mm (22.75&nbsp;inches)\n{{Col-4}}\n;* 1/2 522&nbsp;mm (20.5&nbsp;inches)\n{{Col-4}}\n;* 1/4 484&nbsp;mm (19&nbsp;inches)\n{{Col-end}}\n\nGuitars can be described in size from largest to smallest as:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hago.org.uk/guitars/other/|title=Terz guitars, quart quitars, quint guitars...|author=|date=|website=www.hago.org.uk|accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref>\n- Contra or Octave bass;\n- Bass baritone or Quint bass;\n- Prime or Quart bass;\n- Terz treble;\n- Alto Requinto;\n- Quart;\n- Quint;\n- Soprano, Octave or Piccolo.\n\n==Tuning==\n{{Main article|Guitar tuning}}\nA variety of different tunings are used. The most common by far, which one could call the \"standard tuning\" is:\n*e<sup>I</sup> - b - g - d - A - E\n\nThe above order, is the tuning from the ''1st string'' (highest-pitched string e'&mdash;spatially the bottom string in playing position) to the ''6th string'' - lowest-pitched string E&mdash;spatially the upper string in playing position, and hence comfortable to pluck with the thumb.\n\nThe explanation for this \"asymmetrical\" tuning (in the sense that the maj 3rd is not between the two middle strings as say in the tuning of the viola da gamba) is probably that the guitar originated as a 4-string instrument (actually an instrument with 4 double courses of strings, see above) with a maj 3rd between the 2nd and 3rd strings and that it only became a 6-string instrument by gradual addition of a 5th string and then a 6th string tuned a 4th apart:\n\n\"The development of the modern tuning can be traced in stages. One of the tunings from the 16th century is C-F-A-D. This is equivalent to the top four strings of the modern guitar tuned a tone lower. However, the absolute pitch for these notes is not equivalent to modern \"concert pitch\". The tuning of the four-course guitar was moved up by a tone and toward the end of the 16th century, five-course instruments were in use with an added lower string tuned to A. This produced A-D-G-B-E, one of a wide number of variant tunings of the period. The low E string was added during the 18th century.\"<ref>Richard Chapman, \"The New Complete Guitarist\", p. 10 left</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! String !!

He held academic positions in English literature at both [[Oxford University]] ([[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], 1925\u20131954) and [[Cambridge University]] ([[Magdalene College, Cambridge|Magdalene College]], 1954\u20131963). He is best known for his works of fiction, especially ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'', and ''[[The Space Trilogy]]'', and for his non-fiction Christian apologetics, such as ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'', and ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''.\n\nLewis and fellow novelist [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] were close friends. They both served on the English faculty at Oxford University, and were active in the informal Oxford literary group known as the [[Inklings]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Inklings: C. S. Lewis, J. R.

Lewis returned to  [[Anglicanism]] at the age of 32, owing to the influence of Tolkien and other friends, and he became an \"ordinary layman of the Church of England\".{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=6}} Lewis's faith profoundly affected his work, and his wartime radio broadcasts on the subject of Christianity brought him wide acclaim.\n\nLewis wrote more than 30 books<ref>Richard B. Cunningham, ''C. S. Lewis: Defender of the Faith'', Wipf and Stock Publishers (2008), p. 14</ref> which have been translated into more than 30 languages and have sold millions of copies. The books that make up ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' have sold the most and have been popularised on stage, TV, radio, and cinema. His philosophical writings are widely cited by Christian apologists from many denominations.\n\nIn 1956, Lewis married American writer [[Joy Davidman]]; she died of cancer four years later at the age of 45. Lewis died on 22 November 1963 from [[renal failure]], one week before his 65th birthday.

He and his brother Warnie created the world of [[Boxen (C. S. Lewis)|Boxen]], inhabited and run by animals. Lewis loved to read; his father's house was filled with books, and he felt that finding a book to read was as easy as walking into a field and \"finding a new blade of grass\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=10}}\n{{Quote box|align=right|quote=<poem>\nThe New House is almost a major character in my story.\nI am the product of long corridors, empty sunlit rooms,\nupstair indoor silences, attics explored in solitude,\ndistant noises of gurgling cisterns and pipes,\nand the noise of wind under the tiles.

His father then sent him to live and study at [[Wynyard School]] in [[Watford]], Hertfordshire. Lewis's brother had enrolled there three years previously. The school was closed not long afterwards due to a lack of pupils; the headmaster Robert \"Oldie\" Capron was soon after committed to a psychiatric hospital. Lewis then attended [[Campbell College]] in the east of Belfast about a mile from his home, but left after a few months due to respiratory problems. He was then sent to the health-resort town of [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]], Worcestershire, where he attended the preparatory school Cherbourg House, which Lewis calls \"Chartres\" in his autobiography. It was during this time that Lewis abandoned his childhood Christian faith and became an atheist, becoming interested in mythology and the occult.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=56}} In September 1913, Lewis enrolled at [[Malvern College]], where he remained until the following June. He found the school socially competitive.{{sfn|Lewis|1966a|p=107}} After leaving Malvern, he studied privately with [[William T.

He also grew to love nature; its beauty reminded him of the stories of the North, and the stories of the North reminded him of the beauties of nature. His teenage writings moved away from the tales of Boxen, and he began using different art forms, such as [[epic poetry]] and opera, to try to capture his new-found interest in [[Norse mythology]] and the natural world. Studying with Kirkpatrick (\"The Great Knock\", as Lewis afterwards called him) instilled in him a love of [[Greek literature]] and mythology and sharpened his debate and reasoning skills. In 1916, Lewis was awarded a scholarship at [[University College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cslewis.com/us/about-cs-lewis|title= About C.S.

He developed a particular fondness for [[W. B. Yeats]], in part because of Yeats's use of Ireland's Celtic heritage in poetry.

He writes plays and poems of rare spirit and beauty about our old Irish mythology.\"{{sfn|Lewis|2000|p=59}}\n\nIn 1921, Lewis met Yeats twice, since Yeats had moved to Oxford.{{sfn|Lewis|2004|pp= 564\u201365}} Lewis was surprised to find his English peers indifferent to Yeats and the [[Celtic Revival]] movement, and wrote: \"I am often surprised to find how utterly ignored Yeats is among the men I have met: perhaps his appeal is purely Irish&nbsp;\u2013 if so, then thank the gods that I am Irish.\"<ref name=\"On Yeats\">Yeats's appeal wasn't exclusively Irish; he was also a major \"magical opponent\" of famed English occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], as noted extensively throughout Lawrence Sutin's [https://books.google.com/books?id=JpR0FKRIissC&pg=PA69&lpg=PA32&dq=aleister+crowley+yeats&source=bl&ots=n_oxScdKNJ&sig=I4oh26EII5asPOwxxE9flizlHLc&hl=en&ei=zITTSY3wLpaItAOTzLj8Cw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result ''Do what thou wilt: a life of Aleister Crowley''].

Describing an encounter with a fellow Irishman, he wrote: \"Like all Irish people who meet in England, we ended by criticisms on the invincible flippancy and dullness of the Anglo-Saxon race. After all, there is no doubt, ''ami'', that the Irish are the only people: with all their faults, I would not gladly live or die among another folk.\"{{sfn|Lewis|2004|p= 310}} Throughout his life, he sought out the company of other Irish people living in England{{sfn|Clare|2010|pp=21\u201322}} and visited Northern Ireland regularly.

In 1924 he became a philosophy tutor at [[University College Oxford|University College]] and, in 1925, was elected a Fellow and Tutor in English Literature at [[Magdalen College, Oxford|Magdalen College]], where he served for 29 years until 1954.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n===Jane Moore===\nDuring his army training, Lewis shared a room with another cadet, Edward Courtnay Francis \"Paddy\" Moore (1898\u20131918). Maureen Moore, Paddy's sister, said that the two made a mutual pact{{sfn|Edwards|2007|p=133}} that if either died during the war, the survivor would take care of both of their families. Paddy was killed in action in 1918 and Lewis kept his promise. Paddy had earlier introduced Lewis to his mother, Jane King Moore, and a friendship quickly sprang up between Lewis, who was eighteen when they met, and Jane, who was forty-five. The friendship with Moore was particularly important to Lewis while he was recovering from his wounds in hospital, as his father did not visit him.\n\nLewis lived with and cared for Moore until she was hospitalised in the late 1940s. He routinely introduced her as his mother, referred to her as such in letters, and developed a deeply affectionate friendship with her. Lewis's own mother had died when he was a child, and his father was distant, demanding, and eccentric.\n\nSpeculation regarding their relationship resurfaced with the 1990 publication of [[A. N. Wilson]]'s biography of Lewis. Wilson (who never met Lewis) attempted to make a case for their having been lovers for a time. Wilson's biography was not the first to address the question of Lewis's relationship with Moore. [[George Sayer]] knew Lewis for 29 years, and he had sought to shed light on the relationship during the period of 14 years prior to Lewis's conversion to Christianity. In his biography ''Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis'', he wrote:\n{{quote |Were they lovers? Owen Barfield, who knew Jack well in the 1920s, once said that he thought the likelihood was \"fifty-fifty\". Although she was twenty-six years older than Jack, she was still a handsome woman, and he was certainly infatuated with her. But it seems very odd, if they were lovers, that he would call her \"mother\". We know, too, that they did not share the same bedroom. It seems most likely that he was bound to her by the promise he had given to Paddy and that his promise was reinforced by his love for her as his second mother.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sayer |first=George |year=1997 |title=Jack: A Life of C. S. Lewis |location=London |publisher=Hodder & Stoughton |page=154 |isbn=978-0340690680}}</ref>}}\n\nLater Sayer changed his mind. In the introduction to the 1997 edition of his biography of Lewis he wrote:\n{{quote |I have had to alter my opinion of Lewis's relationship with Mrs. Moore. In chapter eight of this book I wrote that I was uncertain about whether they were lovers.  Now after conversations with Mrs. Moore's daughter, Maureen, and a consideration of the way in which their bedrooms were arranged at The Kilns, I am quite certain that they were.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.impalapublications.com/blog/index.php?/archives/5185-C.S.-Lewis-and-Mrs-Janie-Moore,-by-James-OFee.html|title=C.S. Lewis and Mrs Janie Moore, by James O'Fee|publisher=impalapublications.com}}</ref>}}\n\nLewis spoke well of Mrs. Moore throughout his life, saying to his friend George Sayer, \"She was generous and taught me to be generous, too.\" In December 1917, Lewis wrote in a letter to his childhood friend Arthur Greeves that Jane and Greeves were \"the two people who matter most to me in the world\".\n\nIn 1930, Lewis moved into \"The Kilns\" with his brother Warnie, Mrs. Moore, and her daughter Maureen. The Kilns was a house in the district of [[Headington Quarry]] on the outskirts of Oxford, now part of the suburb of [[Risinghurst]]. They all contributed financially to the purchase of the house, which passed to Maureen, who by then was [[Maureen Dunbar|Dame Maureen Dunbar]], when Warren died in 1973.\n\nJane Moore suffered from [[dementia]] in her later years and was eventually moved into a nursing home, where she died in 1951. Lewis visited her every day in this home until her death.\n\n===Return to Christianity===\nLewis was raised in a religious family that attended the [[Church of Ireland]]. He became an atheist at age 15, though he later described his young self as being paradoxically \"angry with God for not existing\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=115}} His early separation from Christianity began when he started to view his religion as a chore and a duty; around this time, he also gained an interest in the occult, as his studies expanded to include such topics.<ref>''The Critic'', Volume 32, Thomas More Association, 1973. Original from the [[University of Michigan]].</ref> Lewis quoted [[Lucretius]] (''De rerum natura'', 5.198\u20139) as having one of the [[Argument from poor design|strongest arguments]] for atheism:{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=65}}\n\n:{{lang|lt|Nequaquam nobis divinitus esse paratam}}\n:{{lang|lt|Naturam rerum; tanta stat praedita culpa}}\n\nwhich he translated poetically as follows:\n\n:Had God designed the world, it would not be\n:A world so frail and faulty as we see.\n\n(This is a highly poetic, rather than a literal translation.  A more literal translation, by William Ellery Leonard,{{sfn|Lucretius|1916}} reads: \"That in no wise the nature of all things / For us was fashioned by a power divine \u2013 / So great the faults it stands encumbered with.\")\n\nLewis's interest in the works of [[George MacDonald]] was part of what turned him from atheism. This can be seen particularly well through this passage in Lewis's ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', chapter nine, when the semi-autobiographical [[Protagonist|main character]] meets MacDonald in [[Heaven]]:\n{{quote |...&nbsp;I tried, trembling, to tell this man all that his writings had done for me. I tried to tell how a certain frosty afternoon at Leatherhead Station when I had first bought a copy of ''[[Phantastes]]'' (being then about sixteen years old) had been to me what the first sight of Beatrice had been to Dante: ''Here begins the new life''. I started to confess how long that Life had delayed in the region of imagination merely: how slowly and reluctantly I had come to admit that his Christendom had more than an accidental connexion with it, how hard I had tried not to see the true name of the quality which first met me in his books is Holiness.{{sfn|Lewis|2002b|pp=66\u201367}}}}\n\nHe eventually returned to Christianity, having been influenced by arguments with his Oxford colleague and Christian friend [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], whom he seems to have met for the first time on 11 May 1926, and the book ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'' by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Lewis vigorously resisted conversion, noting that he was brought into Christianity like a prodigal, \"kicking, struggling, resentful, and darting his eyes in every direction for a chance to escape\".{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=229}} He described his last struggle in ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'':\n\n{{quote |You must picture me alone in that room in Magdalen [College, Oxford], night after night, feeling, whenever my mind lifted even for a second from my work, the steady, unrelenting approach of Him whom I so earnestly desired not to meet. That which I greatly feared had at last come upon me. In the Trinity Term of 1929 I gave in, and admitted that God was God, and knelt and prayed: perhaps, that night, the most dejected and reluctant convert in all England.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|pp=228, 229}}}}\n\nAfter his conversion to [[theism]] in 1929, Lewis converted to Christianity in 1931, following a long discussion and late-night walk with his close friends Tolkien and [[Hugo Dyson]]. He records making a specific commitment to Christian belief while on his way to the zoo with his brother. He became a member of the [[Church of England]]&nbsp;\u2013 somewhat to the disappointment of Tolkien, who had hoped that he would join the Catholic Church.{{sfn|Carpenter|2006}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=March 2012}}{{incomplete short citation|date=October 2016}}\n\nLewis was a committed [[Church of England|Anglican]] who upheld a largely orthodox Anglican theology, though in his [[apologetics|apologetic]] writings, he made an effort to avoid espousing any one denomination. In his later writings, some believe that he proposed ideas such as purification of [[venial sin]]s after death in [[purgatory]] (''[[The Great Divorce]]'' and ''[[Letters to Malcolm]]'') and [[mortal sin]] (''[[The Screwtape Letters]]''), which are generally considered to be Roman Catholic teachings, although they are also widely held in Anglicanism (particularly in [[high church]] [[Anglo-Catholicism|Anglo-Catholic]] circles). Regardless, Lewis considered himself an entirely orthodox Anglican to the end of his life, reflecting that he had initially attended church only to receive communion and had been repelled by the hymns and the poor quality of the sermons. He later came to consider himself honoured by worshipping with men of faith who came in shabby clothes and work boots and who sang all the verses to all the hymns.{{sfn|Wilson|2002|p=147}}\n\n===Second World War===\nAfter the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] in 1939, the Lewises took child evacuees from London and other cities into [[The Kilns]].<ref name=tst>{{cite book |last=Bingham |first=Derick |title=C.

Lewis's book ''[[A Grief Observed]]'' describes his experience of bereavement in such a raw and personal fashion that he originally released it under the pseudonym N. W.

His book \"A Preface to ''Paradise Lost''\" is still one of the most valuable criticisms of that work.

Tolkien was both.{{sfn|Lewis|1966b|p=216}}}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Novelist===\nIn addition to his scholarly work, Lewis wrote several popular novels, including the science fiction ''[[Space Trilogy]]'' for adults and the [[Narnia]] fantasies for children. Most deal implicitly with Christian themes such as sin, humanity's [[Fall of Man|fall from grace]], and redemption.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nHis first novel after becoming a Christian was ''[[The Pilgrim's Regress]]'' (1933), which depicted his experience with Christianity in the style of [[John Bunyan]]'s ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. The book was poorly received by critics at the time,<ref name=\"Thomas\" /> although David [[Martyn Lloyd-Jones]], one of Lewis's contemporaries at Oxford, gave him much-valued encouragement. Asked by Lloyd-Jones when he would write another book, Lewis replied, \"When I understand the meaning of prayer.\"{{sfn|Murray|1990}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}\n\n{{Citation needed span|The ''[[Space Trilogy]]'' (also called the ''Cosmic Trilogy'' or ''Ransom Trilogy'') dealt with what Lewis saw as the dehumanising trends in contemporary science fiction. The first book, ''[[Out of the Silent Planet]]'', was apparently written following a conversation with his friend J.R.R. Tolkien about these trends. Lewis agreed to write a \"space travel\" story and Tolkien a \"time travel\" one, but Tolkien never completed \"[[The Lost Road and Other Writings|The Lost Road]]\", linking his [[Middle-earth]] to the modern world. Lewis's main character [[Elwin Ransom]] is based in part on Tolkien, a fact to which Tolkien alludes in his letters.\n\nThe second novel, ''[[Perelandra]]'', depicts a new [[Garden of Eden]] on the planet Venus, a new [[Adam and Eve]], and a new \"serpent figure\" to tempt Eve. The story can be seen as an account of what might have happened if the terrestrial Adam had defeated the serpent and avoided the [[Fall of Man]], with Ransom intervening in the novel to \"ransom\" the new Adam and Eve from the deceptions of the enemy. The third novel, ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', develops the theme of nihilistic science threatening traditional human values, embodied in Arthurian legend.|date=November 2016}}\n\nMany ideas in the trilogy, particularly opposition to dehumanization as portrayed in the third book, are presented more formally in ''[[The Abolition of Man]]'', based on a series of lectures by Lewis at [[Durham University]] in 1943. Lewis stayed in Durham, where he says he was overwhelmed by the magnificence of [[Durham Cathedral|the cathedral]]. ''That Hideous Strength'' is in fact set in the environs of \"Edgestow\" university, a small English university like Durham, though Lewis disclaims any other resemblance between the two.{{sfn|Lewis|1945|page=}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[Walter Hooper]], Lewis's literary executor, discovered a fragment of another science-fiction novel apparently written by Lewis called ''[[The Dark Tower (1977 novel)|The Dark Tower]]''.

In addition to Christian themes, Lewis also borrows characters from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology]], as well as traditional British and Irish fairy tales.|date=November 2016}}\n\n====Other works====\nLewis wrote several works on [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]. One of these, ''[[The Great Divorce]]'', is a short novella in which a few residents of Hell take a bus ride to Heaven, where they are met by people who dwell there. The proposition is that they can stay if they choose, in which case they can call the place where they had come from \"[[Purgatory]]\", instead of \"Hell\", but many find it not to their taste. The title is a reference to [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', a concept that Lewis found a \"disastrous error\". This work deliberately echoes two other more famous works with a similar theme: the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' of [[Dante Alighieri]], and Bunyan's ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''.\n\nAnother short work, ''[[The Screwtape Letters]]'', consists of letters of advice from senior [[demon]] Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood on the best ways to tempt a particular human and secure his [[Damnation#Religious|damnation]]. Lewis's last novel was ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'', which he thought of as his most mature and masterly work of fiction but which was never a popular success. It is a retelling of the myth of [[Cupid and Psyche]] from the unusual perspective of Psyche's sister. It is deeply concerned with religious ideas, but the setting is entirely [[paganism|pagan]], and the connections with specific Christian beliefs are left implicit.{{Citation needed|reason=standardized earlier cn request beginning with unreffed info halway up in previous paragraph|date=November 2016}}\n\nBefore Lewis's conversion to Christianity, he published two books: ''[[Spirits in Bondage]]'', a collection of poems, and ''[[Dymer]]'', a single [[narrative poetry|narrative poem]].

''Mere Christianity'', ''[[The Problem of Pain]]'', and ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles]]'' were all concerned, to one degree or another, with refuting popular objections to Christianity, such as the question, \"How could a good God allow pain to exist in the world?\" He also became a popular lecturer and broadcaster, and some of his writing originated as scripts for radio talks or lectures (including much of ''Mere Christianity'').{{sfn|Lewis|1997|page=}}{{Rp | needed = yes|date=March 2012}}\n\nAccording to George Sayer, losing a 1948 debate with [[G.

Certainly Anscombe herself believed that Lewis's argument, though flawed, was getting at something very important; she thought that this came out more in the improved version of it that Lewis presented in a subsequent edition of ''Miracles''&nbsp;\u2013 though that version also had 'much to criticize in it'.\"{{Cite quote|date=October 2018}}\n\nLewis also wrote an autobiography titled ''Surprised by Joy'', which places special emphasis on his own conversion. (It was written before he met his wife, Joy Gresham; the title of the book came from the first line of a poem by [[William Wordsworth]].) His essays and public speeches on Christian belief, many of which were collected in ''[[God in the Dock]]'' and ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]'', remain popular today.|date=November 2016}}\n\nHis most famous works, the ''Chronicles of Narnia'', contain many strong Christian messages and are often considered [[allegory]]. Lewis, an expert on the subject of allegory, maintained that the books were not allegory, and preferred to call the Christian aspects of them \"[[supposition]]al\". As Lewis wrote in a letter to a Mrs. Hook in December 1958:\n<blockquote>\nIf Aslan represented the immaterial Deity in the same way in which Giant Despair <nowiki>[</nowiki>a character in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''<nowiki>]</nowiki> represents despair, he would be an allegorical figure. In reality, he is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question, 'What might Christ become like, if there really were a world like Narnia and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours?' This is not allegory at all.{{sfn|Martindale|Root|1990|pp=}}\n</blockquote>\n\n====\"Trilemma\"====\n{{Main|Lewis's trilemma}}\nIn a much-cited passage from ''Mere Christianity'', Lewis challenged the view that Jesus was a great moral teacher but not God. He argued that Jesus made several implicit claims to divinity, which would logically exclude that claim:\n\n{{quote|I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic&nbsp;\u2013 on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg&nbsp;\u2013 or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronising nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=43}}}}\n\nAlthough this argument is sometimes called \"Lewis's trilemma\", Lewis did not invent it but rather developed and popularized it. It has also been used by Christian apologist [[Josh McDowell]] in his book ''More Than a Carpenter''.<ref>{{Harvard citation|McDowell|2001}}</ref> It has been widely repeated in Christian apologetic literature, but largely ignored by professional theologians and biblical scholars.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Stephen T. |last=Davis |chapter=Was Jesus Mad, Bad, or God? |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLtu0IwjK5oC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA221,M1 |editor=Stephen T.

In the first five chapters of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis discusses the idea that people have a standard of behaviour to which they expect people to adhere. Lewis claims that people all over the earth know what this law is and when they break it. He goes on to claim that there must be someone or something behind such a universal set of principles.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=144}}\n<blockquote>\nThese then are the two points that I wanted to make. First, that human beings, all over the earth, have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way, and cannot really get rid of it. Secondly, that they do not in fact behave in that way. They know the Law of Nature; they break it. These two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=21}}\n</blockquote>\nLewis also portrays Universal Morality in his works of fiction. In ''The Chronicles of Narnia'' he describes Universal Morality as the \"deep magic\" which everyone knew.{{sfn|Lindskoog|2001|p=146}}\n\nIn the second chapter of ''Mere Christianity'' Lewis recognises that \"many people find it difficult to understand what this Law of Human Nature&nbsp;... is.\" And he responds first to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply our herd instinct\" and second to the idea \"that the Moral Law is simply a social convention\". In responding to the second idea Lewis notes that people often complain that one set of moral ideas is better than another, but that this actually argues for there existing some \"Real Morality\" to which they are comparing other moralities. Finally he notes that sometimes differences in moral codes are exaggerated by people who confuse differences in beliefs about morality with differences in beliefs about facts:\n\n{{quote |I have met people who exaggerate the differences, because they have not distinguished between differences of morality and differences of belief about facts. For example, one man said to me, \"Three hundred years ago people in England were putting witches to death. Was that what you call the Rule of Human Nature or Right Conduct?\" But surely the reason we do not execute witches is that we do not believe there are such things. If we did&nbsp;\u2013 if we really thought that there were people going about who had sold themselves to the devil and received supernatural powers from him in return and were using these powers to kill their neighbours or drive them mad or bring bad weather, surely we would all agree that if anyone deserved the death penalty, then these filthy [[quisling]]s did. There is no difference of moral principle here: the difference is simply about matter of fact. It may be a great advance in knowledge not to believe in witches: there is no moral advance in not executing them when you do not think they are there. You would not call a man humane for ceasing to set mousetraps if he did so because he believed there were no mice in the house.{{sfn|Lewis|1997|p=26}}}}\n\nLewis also had fairly progressive views on the topic of \"animal morality\", in particular the suffering of animals, as is evidenced by several of his essays: most notably, ''On Vivisection''<ref>{{cite web |first=C.

In 1985, the screenplay ''[[Shadowlands (1985 film)|Shadowlands]]'' by [[William Nicholson (writer)|William Nicholson]] dramatised Lewis's life and relationship with Joy Davidman Gresham. It was aired on British television starring [[Joss Ackland]] and [[Claire Bloom]]. This was also staged as a theatre play starring [[Nigel Hawthorne]] in 1989, and made into the 1993 feature film ''[[Shadowlands (1993 film)|Shadowlands]]'' starring [[Anthony Hopkins]] and [[Debra Winger]].

''The Chronicles of Narnia'' has been particularly influential. Modern children's literature has been more or less influenced by Lewis's series, such as [[Daniel Handler]]'s ''[[A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'', [[Eoin Colfer]]'s ''[[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl]]'', [[Philip Pullman]]'s ''[[His Dark Materials]]'', and [[J.

In [[Cantonese]] they are called ''gwat pai'' ({{lang|zh|\u9aa8\u724c}}), which literally means \"bone tiles\"; it is also the name of a northern Chinese game, where the rules are quite different from the southern Chinese version of Tien Gow.\n\n==History==\n[[Ming dynasty|Ming]] author Xie Zhaozhe (1567\u20131624) records the legend of dominoes having been presented to [[Song Dynasty|Song]] [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] in 1112. However the contemporary [[Li Qingzhao]] (1084 \u2013 {{circa|1155}}) made no mention of dominoes in her compendium of games. The oldest confirmed written mention of dominoes in China comes from the ''Former Events in Wulin'' (i.e. the capital [[Hangzhou]]) written by the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271\u20131368) author Zhou Mi (1232\u20131298), who listed \"''pupai''\" (gambling plaques or dominoes) as well as [[dice]] as items sold by peddlers during the reign of Song [[Emperor Xiaozong of Song|Emperor Xiaozong]] ({{reign|1162|1189}}).<ref name=\"lo 2000 401\">Lo, Andrew (2000) 'The Game of Leaves: An Inquiry into the Origin of Chinese Playing Cards'. [[Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]] , Vol 63-3 p. 401.</ref> Andrew Lo asserts that Zhou Mi meant dominoes when referring to ''pupai'', since the Ming author [[Lu Rong]] (1436\u20131494) explicitly defined ''pupai'' as dominoes (in regards to a story of a suitor who won a maiden's hand by drawing out four winning ''pupai'' from a set).<ref name=\"lo 2000 401\"/> Tiles dating from the 12th to 14th centuries have survived. Unlike most modern tiles they are white with black and red pips.\n\nDuring the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1912), the suits known as \"Chinese\" and \"barbarian\" were renamed to \"civil\" and \"military\" respectively to avoid offending the ruling [[Manchu people|Manchus]].<ref>Lo, Andrew (2003) 'Pan Zhiheng's 'Xu Yezi Pu' (Sequel to a Manual of Leaves)- Part 1.' [[The Playing-Card]]: Journal of the [[International Playing-Card Society]], 31 (5). pp. 222.</ref> Tiles with blank ends, like those found in Western \"double-six\" dominoes, once existed during the 17th century. These games employed two sets of \"double-six\" tiles. It is possible that these were the types of dominoes that made it to Europe the following century.<ref>Lo, Andrew (2004) 'China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong.' In: Mackenzie, C. and Finkel, I., (eds.), Asian Games: The Art of Contest. New York: [[Asia Society]], pp. 224.</ref>\n\n==Deck composition and ranking==\nEach tile pattern in the Chinese domino set is made up of the outcome of a throw of two six-sided [[dice]]. Each combination is only used once, so there are 21 unique possible patterns. Eleven of these 21 unique patterns are repeated to make a total of 32 tiles in a Chinese dominoes set. The tile set consists of 32 tiles in two \"suits\" or groups called \"military\" and \"civil\". There are no markings on the tiles to distinguish these suits; a player must simply remember which tiles belong to which group.\n\nThe tile set contains two each of eleven civil suit tiles (6-6, 1-1, 4-4, 1-3, 5-5, 3-3, 2-2, 5-6, 4-6, 1-6, 1-5) and one each of ten military suit tiles (3-6, 4-5; 2-6, 3-5; 2-5, 3-4; 2-4; 1-4, 2-3; 1-2).  Each civil tile also has a Chinese name (and common rough translation to English): The 6-6 is ''tin'' ({{lang|zh|\u5929}} heaven), 1-1 is ''dei'' ({{lang|zh|\u5730}} earth), 4-4 is ''yan'' ({{lang|zh|\u4eba}} man), 1-3 is ''ngo'' ({{lang|zh|\u9d5d}} goose or {{lang|zh|\u548c}} harmony), 5-5 is ''mui'' ({{lang|zh|\u6885}} [[Prunus mume|plum]] flower), 3-3 is ''cheung'' ({{lang|zh|\u9577}} long), 2-2 is ''ban'' ({{lang|zh|\u677f}} board), 5-6 is ''fu'' ({{lang|zh|\u65a7}} hatchet), 4-6 is ''ping'' ({{lang|zh|\u5c4f}} partition), 1-6 is ''tsat'' ({{lang|zh|\u4e03}}) (long leg seven), and 1-5 is ''luk'' ({{lang|zh|\u516d}}) (big head six).\n\nThe civil tiles are ranked according to the Chinese cultural significance of the tile names, and must be memorized.  The [[hendiatris]] of [[:zh:\u4e09\u624d|heaven, earth, and man]] ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u5730\u4eba}}) dates back for over two thousand years <ref>[http://ctext.org/pre-qin-and-han?searchu=%E5%A4%A9%E5%9C%B0%E4%BA%BA Chinese Text Project]</ref> while the harmony ({{lang|zh|\u548c}}) of the three have been in dice and domino games since at least the Ming dynasty. Remembering the suits and rankings of the tiles is easier if one understands the Chinese names of the tiles and the symbolism behind them. The military tiles are named and ranked according to the total points on the tiles.  For example, the \"nines\" (3-6 and 4-5) rank higher than the \"eights\" (2-6 and 3-5).\n\nThe military tiles (since there is only one each) are also considered to be five mixed \"pairs\" (for example, the 3-6 and 4-5 tiles \"match\" because they have same total points and both in the military suit).  Among the military tiles, individual tiles of the same pair (such as 1-4 and 2-3) rank equally.   The 2-4 and 1-2 are an odd pair.  They are the only tiles in the whole set that don't match other tiles in the normal sense.  This pair when played together is considered a suit on its own, called the ''gi jun'' ({{lang|zh|\u81f3\u5c0a}} supreme).  It is the highest ranking pair in the game of Pai Gow, though the tiles rank low individually (in their normal order).  When a tile of this pair is played individually in the game of Tien Gow, each takes its regular ranking among other military suit tiles according to the total points.  The rankings of the individual tiles are similar in most games.  However, the ranking of combination tiles is slightly different in Pai Gow and Tien Gow.\n\nUsing the same coloring scheme of the traditional Chinese dice, every half-domino with 1 or 4 pips has those pips colored red (for example, the 4-5 domino has four red pips and five white pips).  The only exception is the pair of 6-6 tiles.  Half of the pips on the 6-6 domino are colored red to make them stand out as the top ranking tiles.\n\nVariant sets include the Digging Flowers ({{lang|zh|[[:zh:\u6316\u82b1|\u6316\u82b1]]}}) game in which some tiles have flowers printed on them while others have their values duplicated and may have [[mahjong]] type flower and blank tiles. Other sets may include tiles with [[Xiangqi]] characters.\n\n==Bone Tiles game==\n<!--Rules are incomplete, please help by finding more sources-->\nThe eponymous game of Bone Tiles (''g\u01d4p\u00e1i'' in Mandarin) is played in northern and central China and as far south as [[Hunan]].<ref name=\"Celko\">{{cite web|last1=Celko|first1=Joe|last2=McLeod|first2=John|title=Tien Gow|url=https://www.pagat.com/tile/cdom/tiengow.html|website=[[pagat.com]]|accessdate=5 April 2016|ref=Celko}}</ref><ref>Lai, C.P.

The continents also moved into their current positions during this era.\n\nEarly in the Cenozoic, following the [[K-Pg extinction event]], most of the fauna was relatively small, and included small mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians. From a geological perspective, it did not take long for mammals and birds to greatly diversify in the absence of the large reptiles that had dominated during the Mesozoic.

Knowledge of this era is more detailed than any other era because of the relatively young, well-preserved rocks associated with it.\n\n===Paleogene Period===\nThe Paleogene spans from the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, 66 million years ago, to the dawn of the Neogene, 23.03 million years ago. It features three [[epoch (geology)|epoch]]s: the [[Paleocene]], [[Eocene]] and [[Oligocene]].  [[File:Basilosaurus.jpg|thumb|''[[Basilosaurus]]'']]\n\nThe [[Paleocene epoch]] lasted from 66 million to 56 million years ago. Modern placental mammals originated during this time. The Paleocene is a transitional point between the devastation that is the [[K-T extinction]], to the rich jungle environment that is the Early Eocene. The Early Paleocene saw the recovery of the earth. The continents began to take their modern shape, but all the continents and the subcontinent of India were separated from each other. [[Afro-Eurasia]] was separated by the [[Tethys Sea]], and the Americas were separated by the strait of Panama, as the isthmus had not yet formed. This epoch featured a general warming trend, with jungles eventually reaching the poles. The oceans were dominated by sharks<ref>{{Citation|last=Royal Tyrrell Museum|title=Lamniform sharks: 110 million years of ocean supremacy|date=2012-03-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e4p9EWuVxYQ|accessdate=2017-07-12}}</ref> as the large reptiles that had once predominated were extinct. Archaic mammals filled the world such as [[creodonts]] (extinct carnivores, unrelated to existing [[Carnivora]]).\n\nThe [[Eocene Epoch]] ranged from 56 million years to 33.9 million years ago. In the Early-Eocene, species living in dense forest were unable to evolve into larger forms, as in the Paleocene. There was nothing over the weight of 10 kilograms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/eocene.php|title=Eocene Epoch|author=University of California|work=University of California}}</ref> Among them were early primates, whales and horses along with many other early forms of mammals. At the top of the food chains were huge birds, such as [[Paracrax]]. The temperature was 30 degrees Celsius with little temperature gradient from pole to pole. In the Mid-Eocene, the Circumpolar-Antarctic current between Australia and Antarctica formed. This disrupted ocean currents worldwide and as a result caused a global cooling effect, shrinking the jungles. This allowed mammals to grow to mammoth proportions, such as whales which, by that time, had become almost fully aquatic. Mammals like ''[[Andrewsarchus]]'' were at the top of the food-chain. The Late Eocene saw the rebirth of seasons, which caused the expansion of savanna-like areas, along with the evolution of [[grass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/eocene.php|title=Eocene Climate|author=University of California|work=University of California}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/paleogene/|title=Eocene|author=National Geographic Society|work=National Geographic}}</ref> The end of the Eocene was marked by the [[Eocene-Oligocene extinction event]], the European face of which is known as the [[Grande Coupure]].\n\nThe [[Oligocene Epoch]] spans from 33.9 million to 23.03 million years ago. The Oligocene featured the expansion of [[grass]] which had led to many new species to evolve, including the first elephants, cats, dogs, marsupials and many other species still prevalent today. Many other species of plants evolved in this period too. A cooling period featuring seasonal rains was still in effect. Mammals still continued to grow larger and larger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/oligocene.php|title=Oligocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}</ref>\n\n===Neogene===\n[[File:Miocene.jpg|thumb|Animals of the Miocene (''[[Chalicotherium]]'', ''[[Hyenadon]]'', [[Entelodont]]...). Mammals are the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Cenozoic.]]The Neogene spans from 23.03 million to 2.58 million years ago.  It features 2 epochs: the Miocene, and the Pliocene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/408872/Neogene-Period|title=Neogene|author=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Miocene epoch]] spans from 23.03 to 5.333 million years ago and is a period in which [[grass]] spread further, dominating a large portion of the world, at the expense of forests. [[Kelp]] forests evolved, encouraging the evolution of new species, such as [[sea otter]]s. During this time, [[perissodactyla]] thrived, and evolved into many different varieties. [[Apes]] evolved into 30 species. The [[Tethys Sea]] finally closed with the creation of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], leaving only remnants as the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Red sea|Red]], [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. This increased aridity. Many new plants evolved: 95% of modern [[Spermatophyte|seed plants]] evolved in the mid-Miocene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/miocene.php|title=Miocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Pliocene epoch]] lasted from 5.333 to 2.58 million years ago. The Pliocene featured dramatic climactic changes, which ultimately led to modern species and plants. The Mediterranean Sea dried up for several million years (because the [[ice age]]s reduced sea levels, disconnecting the [[Atlantic ocean|Atlantic]] from the Mediterranean, and evaporation rates exceeded inflow from rivers). ''[[Australopithecus]]'' evolved in [[Africa]], beginning the human branch. The [[isthmus of Panama]] formed, and animals migrated between [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], wreaking havoc on local ecologies. Climatic changes brought: [[savanna]]s that are still continuing to spread across the world; Indian [[monsoon]]s; [[desert]]s in central [[Asia]]; and the beginnings of the [[Sahara]] desert. The world map has not changed much since, save for changes brought about by the [[glaciations]] of the Quaternary, such as the [[Great Lakes]], [[Hudson Bay]], and the [[Baltic sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/tertiary/pliocene.php|title=Pliocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/pliocene.html|title=Pliocene climate|author=Jonathan Adams|work=Oak Ridge National Library|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225011508/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/projects/qen/pliocene.html|archivedate=25 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Quaternary===\nThe Quaternary spans from 2.58 million years ago to present day, and is the shortest geological period in the [[Phanerozoic Eon]]. It features modern animals, and dramatic changes in the climate.  It is divided into two epochs: the Pleistocene and the Holocene. [[File:Ice age fauna of northern Spain - Mauricio Ant\u00f3n.jpg|thumb|Megafauna of the Pleistocene ([[mammoth]]s, [[Panthera leo spelaea|cave lions]], [[woolly rhino]], ''[[Megaloceros]]'', [[horses]])]]\n\nThe Pleistocene lasted from 2.58 million to 11,700 years ago. This epoch was marked by ice ages as a result of the cooling trend that started in the Mid-Eocene. There were at least four separate glaciation periods marked by the advance of ice caps as far south as 40 degrees N latitude in mountainous areas. Meanwhile, Africa experienced a trend of desiccation which resulted in the creation of the Sahara, Namib, and Kalahari deserts. Many animals evolved including [[mammoth]]s, [[giant ground sloths]], [[dire wolves]], saber-toothed cats, and most famously ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. 100,000 years ago marked the end of one of the worst droughts in Africa, and led to the expansion of primitive humans. As the Pleistocene drew to a close, a major extinction wiped out much of the world's megafauna, including some of the hominid species, such as Neanderthals. All the continents were affected, but Africa to a lesser extent. It still retains many large animals, such as hippos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/pleistocene.php|title=Pleistocene|author=University of California|work=University of California}}</ref>\n\nThe Holocene began 11,700 years ago and lasts to the present day.

From a geological perspective, it did not take long for mammals and birds to greatly diversify in the absence of the dinosaurs that had dominated during the Mesozoic. Some flightless birds grew larger than humans. These species are sometimes referred to as \"[[terror bird]]s,\" and were formidable predators. Mammals came to occupy almost every available [[ecological niche|niche]] (both marine and [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]]), and some also grew very large, attaining sizes not seen in most of today's terrestrial mammals.\n\nEarly animals were the [[Entelodon]] (a so-called \"hell pig\"), [[Paraceratherium]] (a hornless rhinoceros relative) and [[Basilosaurus]] (an early whale). The extinction of many large [[diapsid]] groups, such as flightless [[dinosaurs]], [[Plesiosauria]] and [[Pterosauria]] allowed mammals and birds to greatly diversify and become the world's predominant fauna.\n\n==Tectonics==\n[[Geology|Geologically]], the Cenozoic is the era when the [[continent]]s moved into their current positions. [[Australia (continent)|Australia-New Guinea]], having split from [[Pangea]] during the early [[Cretaceous]], drifted north and, eventually, collided with [[South-east Asia]]; [[Antarctica]] moved into its current position over the [[South Pole]]; the [[Atlantic Ocean]] widened and, later in the era (2.8 million years ago), [[South America]] became attached to [[North America]] with the [[isthmus of Panama]].\n\nIndia collided with Asia {{Ma|55|45}} creating the Himalayas; Arabia collided with Eurasia, closing the [[Tethys Ocean]] and creating the Zagros Mountains, around {{Ma|35}}.<ref name=Allen2008>{{cite journal| first1 = M.

After the tectonic creation of [[Drake Passage]] at {{Ma|41}}, when South America fully detached from Antarctica during the [[Oligocene]], the climate cooled significantly due to the advent of the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] which brought cool deep Antarctic water to the surface. The cooling trend continued in the [[Miocene]], with relatively short warmer periods. When South America became attached to North America creating the [[Isthmus of Panama]] around {{Ma|2.8}}, the Arctic region cooled due to the strengthening of the [[Humboldt Current|Humboldt]] and [[Gulf Stream]] currents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/oceanus/viewArticle.do?id=2508|title=How the Isthmus of Panama Put Ice in the Arctic|work=Oceanus Magazine}}</ref> eventually leading to the glaciations of the [[Quaternary glaciation|Quaternary ice age]], the current [[interglacial]] of which is the [[Holocene]] Epoch.\nRecent analysis of the geomagnetic reversal frequency, oxygen isotope record, and tectonic plate subduction rate, which are indicators of the changes in the heat flux at the core mantle boundary, climate and plate tectonic activity, shows that all these changes indicate similar rhythms on million years' timescale in the Cenozoic Era occurring with the common fundamental periodicity of \u223c13 Myr during most of the time.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chen | first1 = J. | last2 = Kravchinsky | first2 = V.A. | last3 = Liu | first3 = X. | year = 2015 | title = The 13 million year Cenozoic pulse of the Earth | url = | journal = Earth and Planetary Science Letters | volume = 431 | issue = | pages = 256\u2013263 | doi = 10.1016/j.epsl.2015.09.033 | bibcode=2015E&PSL.431..256C}}</ref>\n\n==Life==\nDuring the Cenozoic, [[Mammal evolution#Expansion of ecological niches in the Mesozoic|mammals proliferated]] from a few small, simple, generalized forms into a diverse collection of [[Terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[Marine mammal|marine]], and [[bat|flying]] animals, giving this period its other name, the Age of Mammals, despite the fact that there are more than twice as many [[bird]] species as mammal species.

In the late Tang, Confucianism developed in response to Buddhism and Taoism and was reformulated as [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This reinvigorated form was adopted as the basis of the [[imperial exams]] and the core philosophy of the [[scholar-officials|scholar official class]] in the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131297). The abolition of the examination system in 1905 marked the end of official Confucianism. The intellectuals of the [[New Culture Movement]] of the early twentieth century blamed Confucianism for China's weaknesses. They searched for new doctrines to replace Confucian teachings; some of these new ideologies include the \"[[Three Principles of the People]]\" with the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], and then [[Maoism]] under the [[People's Republic of China]].

Confucianism focuses on the practical order that is given by a this-worldly awareness of the ''Ti\u0101n''.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10|quote=[...] Confucianism is basically ''non-theistic''. While Heaven (''ti\u0101n'') has some characteristics that overlap the category of deity, it is primarily an ''impersonal'' absolute, like ''dao'' and ''Brahman''. \"Deity\" (''theos'', ''deus''), on the other hand connotes something ''personal'' (he or she, not it).}}{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12|quote=Confucianism deconstructs the sacred-profane dichotomy; it asserts that sacredness is to be found ''in'', not behind or beyond, the ordinary activities of human life \u2014 and especially in human relationships. Human relationships are sacred in Confucianism because they are the expression of our moral nature (\u6027 ''x\u00ecng''), which has a transcendent anchorage in Heaven (''ti\u0101n'' \u5929). Herbert Fingarette captured this essential feature of Confucianism in the title of his 1972 book, ''Confucius: The Secular as Sacred''. To assume a dualistic relationship between sacred and profane and to use this as a criterion of religion is to beg the question of whether Confucianism can count as a religious tradition.}} Confucian liturgy (called \u5112 ''r\u00fa'', or sometimes \u6b63\u7d71/\u6b63\u7edf ''zh\u00e8ngt\u01d2ng'', meaning \"[[orthopraxy|orthoprax]]\") led by Confucian priests or \"sages of rites\" (\u79ae\u751f/\u793c\u751f ''l\u01d0sh\u0113ng'') to worship the gods in public and ancestral [[Chinese temple]]s is preferred on certain occasions, by Confucian religious groups and for civil religious rites, over Taoist or popular ritual.{{sfnb|Clart|2003|pp=3\u20135}}\n\nThe worldly concern of Confucianism rests upon the belief that human beings are fundamentally good, and teachable, improvable, and perfectible through personal and communal endeavor, especially self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucian thought focuses on the cultivation of virtue in a morally organised world. Some of the basic Confucian ethical concepts and practices include ''r\u00e9n'', ''y\u00ec'', and ''l\u01d0'', and ''zh\u00ec''. ''R\u00e9n'' (\u4ec1, \"benevolence\" or \"humaneness\") is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion. It is the virtue-form of Heaven.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}} ''Y\u00ec'' (\u7fa9/\u4e49) is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. ''L\u01d0'' (\u79ae/\u793c) is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life in harmony with the law of Heaven. ''Zh\u00ec'' (\u667a) is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others. Confucianism holds one in contempt, either passively or actively, for failure to uphold the cardinal moral values of ''r\u00e9n'' and ''y\u00ec''.\n\nTraditionally, cultures and countries in the [[East Asian cultural sphere]] are strongly influenced by Confucianism, including mainland [[culture of China|China]], [[culture of Taiwan|Taiwan]], [[culture of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[culture of Macau|Macau]], [[culture of Korea|Korea]], [[culture of Japan|Japan]], and [[culture of Vietnam|Vietnam]], as well as various territories settled predominantly by [[Han Chinese|Chinese people]], such as [[culture of Singapore|Singapore]].

Confucianism was initiated by Confucius, developed by [[Mencius]] (~372\u2013289 BCE) and inherited by later generations, undergoing constant transformations and restructuring since its establishment, but preserving the principles of humaneness and righteousness at its core.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}\n\n===Five Classics (\u4e94\u7ecf, ''W\u01d4j\u012bng'') and the Confucian vision===\n[[File:Confucius, fresco from a Western Han tomb of Dongping County, Shandong province, China.jpg|thumb|[[Confucius]] in a fresco from a [[Western Han]] tomb in [[Dongping County|Dongping]], [[Shandong]]]]\nTraditionally, Confucius was thought to be the author or editor of the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Five Classics]] which were the basic texts of Confucianism. The scholar [[Xinzhong Yao|Yao Xinzhong]] allows that there are good reasons to believe that Confucian classics took shape in the hands of Confucius, but that \"nothing can be taken for granted in the matter of the early versions of the classics\". Professor Yao says that perhaps most scholars today hold the \"pragmatic\" view that Confucius and his followers, although they did not intend to create a system of classics, \"contributed to their formation\". In any case, it is undisputed that for most of the last 2,000 years, Confucius was believed to have either written or edited these texts. {{sfnb|Yao|2000|p=52-54}}\n\nThe scholar [[Tu Weiming]] explains these classics as embodying \u201cfive visions\" which underlie the development of Confucianism:\n* [[I Ching]] or [[Classic of Change]] or ''Book of Changes,'' generally held to be the earliest of the classics, shows a metaphysical vision which combines divinatory art with numerological technique and ethical insight; philosophy of change sees cosmos as interaction between the two energies yin and yang; universe always shows organismic unity and dynamism.\n* [[Classic of Poetry]]  or ''Book of Songs'' is the earliest anthology of [[Chinese poetry|Chinese poems]] and songs. It shows the poetic vision in the belief that poetry and music convey common human feelings and mutual responsiveness.\n* [[Book of Documents]] or ''Book of History'' Compilation of speeches of major figures and records of events in ancient times embodies the political vision and addresses the kingly way in terms of the ethical foundation for humane government. The documents show the sagacity, filial piety, and work ethic of Yao, Shun, and Yu. They established a political culture which was based on responsibility and trust. Their virtue formed a covenant of social harmony  which did not depend on punishment or coercion.\n* [[Book of Rites]] describes the social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites of the Zhou Dynasty. This social vision defined society not as an adversarial system based on contractual relations but as a community of trust based on social responsibility. The [[Four occupations|four functional occupations]] are cooperative (farmer, scholar, artisan, merchant).\n* [[Spring and Autumn Annals]] chronicles the period to which it gives its name, [[Spring and Autumn period]] (771\u2013476 BCE) and these events emphasise the significance of collective memory for communal self-identification, for reanimating the old is the best way to attain the new.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tu|first=Weiming|chapter=Confucian Tradition in Chinese History|editor-last1=Ropp|editor-first1=Paul S.|editor-last2=Barrett|editor-first2=Timothy Hugh|title=The Heritage of China: Contemporary Perspectives on Chinese Civilization|publisher=University of California Press|year=1990|isbn=0520064410}} p. 113</ref>\n\n==Doctrines==\n\n===Theory and theology===\n[[File:\u5929-oracle.svg|upright|thumb|[[Zhou dynasty]] [[oracle bone script|oracular]] version of the grapheme for ''Ti\u0101n'', representing a man with a head informed by the north [[celestial pole]]{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' and page 3, Vol. III, for the graphic interpretation of the character}}]]\n{{Further|Confucian theology}}\nConfucianism revolves around the pursuit of the unity of the individual self and the God of Heaven (''Ti\u0101n'' \u5929), or, otherwise said, around the relationship between humanity and Heaven.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=10}}{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} The principle of Heaven (''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|L\u01d0]]'' \u7406 or ''[[Tao|D\u00e0o]]'' \u9053), is the order of the creation and the source of divine authority, [[monism|monistic]] in its structure.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Individuals may realise their humanity and become one with Heaven through the contemplation of such order.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} This transformation of the self may be extended to the family and society to create a harmonious fiduciary community.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} Jo\u00ebl Thoraval studied Confucianism as a diffused [[civil religion]] in contemporary China, finding that it expresses itself in the widespread worship of five cosmological entities: Heaven and Earth (''[[Di (Chinese concept)|Di]]'' \u5730), the sovereign or the government (''j\u016bn'' \u541b), ancestors (''q\u012bn'' \u89aa) and masters (''sh\u012b'' \u5e2b).<ref>{{cite article|last=Thoraval|first=Jo\u00ebl|title=Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Ancestors, Masters: Some Remarks on the Politico-Religious in China Today|series=Occasional Papers|number=5|year=2016|publisher=Centre for Studies on China, Korea and Japan|location=Paris, France|url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116171349/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01374321/document|archive-date=16 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nHeaven is not some being pre-existing the temporal world.

Creation is therefore a continuous ordering; it is not a creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''. Yin and yang are the invisible and visible, the receptive and the active, the unshaped and the shaped; they characterise the yearly cycle (winter and summer), the landscape (shady and bright), the sexes (female and male), and even sociopolitical history (disorder and order). Confucianism is concerned with finding \"middle ways\" between yin and yang at every new configuration of the world.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|pp=146\u2013150}}\n\nConfucianism conciliates both the inner and outer polarities of spiritual cultivation, that is to say self-cultivation and world redemption, synthesised in the ideal of \"sageliness within and kingliness without\".{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=100}} ''R\u00e9n'', translated as \"humaneness\" or the essence proper of a human being, is the character of compassionate mind; it is the virtue endowed by Heaven and at the same time the means by which man may achieve oneness with Heaven comprehending his own origin in Heaven and therefore divine essence.

In 3.12 he explains that religious rituals produce meaningful experiences,{{sfnb|Littlejohn|2010|p=36\u201337}} and one has to offer sacrifices in person, acting  in presence, otherwise \"it is the same as not having sacrificed at all\".

It is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children. It is considered the essence of the human being, endowed by Heaven, and at the same time the means by which man may act according to the principle of Heaven (\u5929\u7406, ''Ti\u0101n l\u01d0'') and become one with it.{{sfnb|Tay|2010|p=102}}\n\n[[Yan Hui (disciple of Confucius)|Y\u00e1n Hu\u00ed]], Confucius's most outstanding student, once asked his master to describe the rules of ''r\u00e9n'' and Confucius replied, \"one should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper.\"<ref>Analects 12:1</ref> Confucius also defined ''r\u00e9n'' in the following way: \"wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/yong-ye/zh?en=on|title=\u8ad6\u8a9e : \u96cd\u4e5f - \u4e2d\u570b\u54f2\u5b78\u66f8\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u8a08\u5283|work=\u4e2d\u570b\u54f2\u5b78\u66f8\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u8a08\u5283}}</ref>\n\nAnother meaning of ''r\u00e9n'' is \"not to do to others as you would not wish done to yourself.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/yan-yuan/zh?en=on|title=\u8ad6\u8a9e : \u984f\u6df5 - \u4e2d\u570b\u54f2\u5b78\u66f8\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u8a08\u5283|work=\u4e2d\u570b\u54f2\u5b78\u66f8\u96fb\u5b50\u5316\u8a08\u5283}}</ref> Confucius also said, \"''r\u00e9n'' is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it.\" ''R\u00e9n'' is close to man and never leaves him.\n\n====Rite and centring====\n[[File:Guan County Temple of Confucius.jpg|thumb|Temple of Confucius in [[Dujiangyan City|Dujiangyan]], [[Chengdu]], [[Sichuan]]]]\n[[File:Korean Confucianism-Chugyedaeje-02.jpg|thumb|[[Korean Confucianism|Korean Confucian]] rite in [[Jeju Province|Jeju]]]]\n{{Main|Li (Confucianism)}}\n''Li'' (\u79ae/\u793c) is a classical Chinese word which finds its most extensive use in [[Confucian]] and post-Confucian [[Chinese philosophy]]. ''Li'' is variously translated as \"[[rite]]\" or \"[[reason]],\" \"ratio\" in the pure sense of [[Veda|Vedic]] ''[[\u1e5bta]]'' (\"right,\" \"order\") when referring to the [[cosmos|cosmic]] law, but when referring to its realisation in the context of human social behaviour it has also been translated as \"[[convention (norm)|customs]]\", \"measures\" and \"rules\", among other terms. ''Li'' also means religious rites which establish relations between humanity and the gods.\n\nAccording to Stephan Feuchtwang, rites are conceived as \"what makes the invisible visible\", making possible for humans to cultivate the underlying order of nature. Correctly performed rituals move society in alignment with earthly and heavenly (astral) forces, establishing the harmony of the three realms\u2014Heaven, Earth and humanity. This practice is defined as \"centring\" (\u592e ''y\u0101ng'' or \u4e2d ''zh\u014dng''). Among all things of creation, humans themselves are \"central\" because they have the ability to cultivate and centre natural forces.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=150}}\n\n''Li'' embodies the entire web of interaction between humanity, human objects, and nature. Confucius includes in his discussions of ''li'' such diverse topics as learning, tea drinking, titles, mourning, and governance. [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] cites \"songs and laughter, weeping and lamentation... rice and millet, fish and meat... the wearing of ceremonial caps, embroidered robes, and patterned silks, or of fasting clothes and mourning clothes... spacious rooms and secluded halls, soft mats, couches and benches\" as vital parts of the fabric of ''li''.\n\nConfucius envisioned proper government being guided by the principles of ''li''. Some Confucians proposed that all human beings may pursue perfection by learning and practising ''li''. Overall, Confucians believe that governments should place more emphasis on ''li'' and rely much less on penal punishment when they govern.\n\n====Loyalty====\nLoyalty ({{zh|c=\u5fe0}}, ''zh\u014dng'') is particularly relevant for the social class to which most of Confucius' students belonged, because the most important way for an ambitious young scholar to become a prominent official was to enter a ruler's civil service.\n\nConfucius himself did not propose that \"might makes right,\" but rather that a superior should be obeyed because of his moral rectitude. In addition, loyalty does not mean subservience to authority. This is because reciprocity is demanded from the superior as well. As Confucius stated \"a prince should employ his minister according to the rules of propriety; ministers should serve their prince with faithfulness (loyalty).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/analects/ba-yi|title=The Analects : Ba Yi - Chinese Text Project|work=Chinese Text Project}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[Mencius]] also said that \"when the prince regards his ministers as his hands and feet, his ministers regard their prince as their belly and heart; when he regards them as his dogs and horses, they regard him as another man; when he regards them as the ground or as grass, they regard him as a robber and an enemy.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctext.org/mengzi/li-lou-ii|title=Mengzi : Li Lou II - Chinese Text Project|work=Chinese Text Project}}</ref> Moreover, Mencius indicated that if the ruler is incompetent, he should be replaced.

Like filial piety, loyalty was often subverted by the autocratic regimes in China. Nonetheless, throughout the ages, many Confucians continued to fight against unrighteous superiors and rulers. Many of these Confucians suffered and sometimes died because of their conviction and action.<ref>Example: Hai Rui \u6d77\u745e in the Ming dynasty, Yuan Chang \u8881\u6636 in the Qing and so forth.</ref> During the Ming-Qing era, prominent Confucians such as Wang Yangming promoted individuality and independent thinking as a counterweight to subservience to authority.<ref>Wang Yangming, Instructions for Practical Living and Other Neo-Confucian Writings by Wang Yang-Ming, Wing-tsit Chan tran.

This may be true especially in times of social chaos, such as during the period of the Ming-Qing transition.<ref>See the discussion in \u4f55\u51a0\u5f6a He Guanbiao, ''\u751f\u8207\u6b7b : \u660e\u5b63\u58eb\u5927\u592b\u7684\u6289\u64c7'' (Taipei: Lianjing Chuban Shiye Gongsi, 1997).</ref>\n\n====Filial piety====\n[[File:\u5c1d\u7caa\u5fc3\u5fe7.JPG|thumb|Fourteenth of ''[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]'']]\n{{Main|Filial piety}}\nIn Confucian philosophy, filial [[piety]] ({{zh|c=\u5b5d}}, ''xi\u00e0o'') is a virtue of respect for one's parents and ancestors, and of the hierarchies within society: father\u2013son, elder\u2013junior and male\u2013female.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} The Confucian classic ''[[Classic of Filial Piety|Xiaojing]]'' (\"Book of Piety\"), thought to be written around the Qin-Han period, has historically been the authoritative source on the Confucian tenet of ''xi\u00e0o''. The book, a conversation between Confucius and his student Zeng Shen (\u66fe\u53c3, also known as [[Zengzi]] \u66fe\u5b50), is about how to set up a good society using the principle of ''xi\u00e0o''.<ref name=\"Chang\">{{cite book|author1=Wonsuk Chang|author2=Leah Kalmanson|title=Confucianism in Context: Classic Philosophy and Contemporary Issues, East Asia and Beyond|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UC1mvUKaU8C&pg=PA68|date=8 November 2010|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-1-4384-3191-8|page=68}}</ref>\n\nIn more general terms, filial piety means to be good to one's parents; to take care of one's parents; to engage in good conduct not just towards parents but also outside the home so as to bring a good name to one's parents and ancestors; to perform the duties of one's job well so as to obtain the material means to support parents as well as carry out sacrifices to the ancestors; not be [[rebellious]]; show love, respect and support; display courtesy; ensure male heirs, uphold fraternity among brothers; wisely advise one's parents, including dissuading them from moral unrighteousness, for blindly following the parents' wishes is not considered to be ''xiao''; display sorrow for their sickness and death; and carry out [[sacrifice]]s after their death.\n\nFilial piety is considered a key virtue in [[Chinese culture]], and it is the main concern of a large number of stories. One of the most famous collections of such stories is \"[[The Twenty-four Filial Exemplars]]\" (''Ershi-si xiao'' [[:zh:\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u5b5d|\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u5b5d]]).  These stories depict how children exercised their filial piety in the past. While China has always had a diversity of religious beliefs, filial piety has been common to almost all of them; historian Hugh D.R. Baker calls respect for the family the only element common to almost all Chinese believers.<ref>Baker, Hugh D. R. ''Chinese Family and Kinship.'' New York: Columbia University Press, 1979.  pg. 98</ref>\n\n===Relationships===\nSocial harmony results in part from every individual knowing his or her place in the natural order, and playing his or her part well. Reciprocity or responsibility (''renqing'') extends beyond filial piety and involves the entire network of social relations, even the respect for rulers.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}} When Duke Jing of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] asked about government, by which he meant proper administration so as to bring social harmony, [[Confucius]] replied:\n<blockquote>\nThere is government, when the prince is prince, and the minister is minister; when the father is father, and the son is son. (''Analects'' XII, 11, tr. Legge)\n</blockquote>\n\nParticular duties arise from one's particular situation in relation to others. The individual stands simultaneously in several different relationships with different people: as a junior in relation to parents and elders, and as a senior in relation to younger siblings, students, and others. While juniors are considered in Confucianism to owe their seniors reverence, seniors also have duties of benevolence and concern toward juniors. The same is true with the husband and wife relationship where the husband needs to show benevolence towards his wife and the wife needs to respect the husband in return. This theme of mutuality still exists in East Asian cultures even to this day.\n\nThe Five Bonds are: ruler to ruled, father to son, husband to wife, elder brother to younger brother, friend to friend. Specific duties were prescribed to each of the participants in these sets of relationships. Such duties are also extended to the dead, where the living stand as sons to their deceased family. The only relationship where respect for elders isn't stressed was the friend to friend relationship, where mutual equal respect is emphasised instead. All these duties take the practical form of prescribed rituals, for instance wedding and death rituals.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|p=146}}\n\n===''Junzi''===\n{{Main|Junzi}}\nThe ''junzi'' ({{zh|c=\u541b\u5b50}}, ''j\u016bnz\u01d0'', \"[[prince|lord's son]]\") is a [[Chinese philosophy|Chinese philosophical]] term often translated as \"[[gentleman]]\" or \"superior person\"<ref>Sometimes \"exemplary person.\" Roger T. Ames and Henry Rosemont, Jr., ''The Analects of Confucius: A Philosophical Translation''. Paul Goldin translates it \"noble man\" in an attempt to capture both its early political and later moral meaning. Cf. \"[http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_junzi.html Confucian Key Terms: Junzi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520073016/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/kurtis.hagen/keyterms_junzi.html |date=20 May 2014 }}.\"</ref> and employed by [[Confucius]] in his works to describe the ideal man. In the ''[[I Ching]]'' it is used by the [[King Wen of Zhou|Duke of Wen]].\n\nIn Confucianism, the sage or wise is the ideal personality; however, it is very hard to become one of them. Confucius created the model of ''junzi'', gentleman, which may be achieved by any individual. Later, [[Zhu Xi]] defined ''junzi'' as second only to the sage. There are many characteristics of the ''junzi'': he may live in [[poverty]], he does more and speaks less, he is [[loyalty|loyal]], obedient and knowledgeable. The ''junzi'' disciplines himself. ''Ren'' is fundamental to become a ''junzi''.<ref>{{zh icon}} [http://jds.cass.cn/Item/1390.aspx \u541b\u5b50\u2014\u2014\u5112\u5b66\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u4eba\u683c] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418015158/http://jds.cass.cn/Item/1390.aspx |date=18 April 2015 }}</ref>\n\nAs the potential leader of a nation, a son of the ruler is raised to have a superior ethical and moral position while gaining inner peace through his virtue. To Confucius, the ''junzi'' sustained the functions of government and social stratification through his ethical values. Despite its literal meaning, any righteous man willing to improve himself may become a ''junzi''.\n\nOn the contrary, the ''xiaoren'' (\u5c0f\u4eba, ''xi\u0103or\u00e9n'', \"small or petty person\") does not grasp the value of virtues and seeks only immediate gains. The petty person is [[egotistic]] and does not consider the consequences of his action in the overall scheme of things. Should the ruler be surrounded by ''xiaoren'' as opposed to ''junzi'', his governance and his people will suffer due to their small-mindness. Examples of such ''xiaoren'' individuals may range from those who continually indulge in sensual and [[emotion]]al pleasures all day to the [[politician]] who is interested merely in [[power (social and political)|power]] and [[celebrity|fame]]; neither sincerely aims for the long-term benefit of others.\n\nThe ''junzi'' enforces his rule over his subjects by acting virtuously himself. It is thought that his pure [[virtue]] would lead others to follow his example. The ultimate goal is that the government behaves much like a [[family]], the ''junzi'' being a beacon of filial piety.\n\n===Rectification of names===\n[[File:Tablet of Confucius.jpg|thumb|Priest paying homage to Confucius' tablet, c. 1900]]\n{{Main|Rectification of names}}\nConfucius believed that social disorder often stemmed from failure to perceive, understand, and deal with [[reality]]. Fundamentally, then, social disorder may stem from the failure to call things by their proper names, and his solution to this was ''zh\u00e8ngm\u00edng'' ({{zh|c=\u6b63\u540d|p=zh\u00e8ngm\u00edng|l=rectification of terms}}). He gave an explanation of ''zhengming'' to one of his disciples.\n\n<blockquote>\nZi-lu said, \"The vassal of Wei has been waiting for you, in order with you to administer the government. What will you consider the first thing to be done?\"<br>\nThe Master replied, \"What is necessary to rectify names.\"<br>\n\"So! indeed!\" said Zi-lu. \"You are wide off the mark! Why must there be such rectification?\"<br>\nThe Master said, \"How uncultivated you are, Yu! The superior man [Junzi] cannot care about the everything, just as he cannot go to check all himself!<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If names be not correct, language is not in accordance with the truth of things.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If language be not in accordance with the truth of things, affairs cannot be carried on to success.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When affairs cannot be carried on to success, proprieties and music do not flourish.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When proprieties and music do not flourish, punishments will not be properly awarded.<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When punishments are not properly awarded, the people do not know how to move hand or foot.<br>\nTherefore a superior man considers it necessary that the names he uses may be spoken appropriately, and also that what he speaks may be carried out appropriately. What the superior man requires is just that in his words there may be nothing incorrect.\"<br>\n(''Analects'' XIII, 3, tr. Legge)\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Xun Zi]] chapter (22) \"On the Rectification of Names\" claims the ancient sage-kings chose names ({{zh|c=\u540d|p=m\u00edng}}) that directly corresponded with actualities ({{zh|c=\u5be6|p=sh\u00ed}}), but later generations confused terminology, coined new nomenclature, and thus could no longer distinguish right from wrong. Since [[harmonious society|social harmony]] is of utmost importance, without the proper rectification of names, society would essentially crumble and \"undertakings [would] not [be] completed.\" <ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Rodney L.|last2=Choy|first2=Howard Y.

Shangdi was conceived as the first ancestor of the Shang royal house,{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} an alternate name for him being the \"Supreme Progenitor\" (\u4e0a\u7532 ''Sh\u00e0ngji\u01ce'').{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=227\u2013228, Vol. II}} In Shang theology, the multiplicity of gods of nature and ancestors were viewed as parts of Di, and the four \u65b9 ''[[Wufang Shangdi|f\u0101ng]]'' (\"directions\" or \"sides\") and their \u98a8 ''f\u0113ng'' (\"winds\") as his [[cosmos|cosmic]] will.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=143\u2013144, Vol. II}} With the Zhou dynasty, which overthrew the Shang, the name for the supreme godhead became ''[[Tian]]'' (\u5929 \"Heaven\").{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} While the Shang identified Shangdi as their ancestor-god to assert their claim to power by divine right, the Zhou transformed this claim into a legitimacy based on moral power, the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. In Zhou theology, Tian had no singular earthly progeny, but bestowed divine favour on virtuous rulers. Zhou kings declared that their victory over the Shang was because they were virtuous and loved their people, while the Shang were tyrants and thus were deprived of power by Tian.{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}}\n\nJohn C. Didier and David Pankenier relate the shapes of both the ancient [[Chinese characters]] for Di and Tian to the patterns of stars in the northern skies, either drawn, in Didier's theory by connecting the constellations bracketing the north celestial pole as a square,{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=103, Vol. II}} or in Pankenier's theory by connecting some of the stars which form the constellations of the Big Dipper and broader [[Ursa Major]], and [[Ursa Minor]] (Little Dipper).{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|pp=138\u2013148, \"Chapter 4: Bringing Heaven Down to Earth\"}} Cultures in other parts of the world have also conceived these stars or constellations as symbols of the origin of things, the supreme godhead, divinity and royal power.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|loc=''passim'' Vol. I}} The supreme godhead was also identified with the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]], symbol of unlimited power (''[[qi]]''),{{sfnb|Libbrecht|2007|p=43}} of the \"protean\" primordial power which embodies both [[yin and yang]] in unity, associated to the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] which winds around the north [[orbital pole|ecliptic pole]],{{sfnb|Pankenier|2013|p=55}} and slithers between the Little and Big Dipper.\n\nBy the 6th century BCE the power of Tian and the symbols that represented it on earth (architecture of cities, temples, altars and ritual cauldrons, and the Zhou ritual system) became \"diffuse\" and claimed by different potentates in the Zhou states to legitimise economic, political, and military ambitions. Divine right no longer was an exclusive privilege of the Zhou royal house, but might be bought by anyone able to afford the elaborate ceremonies and the old and new rites required to access the authority of Tian.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxvi\u2013xxxvii, Vol. I}}\n\nBesides the waning Zhou ritual system, what may be defined as \"wild\" (\u91ce ''y\u011b'') traditions, or traditions \"outside of the official system\", developed as attempts to access the will of Tian. The population had lost faith in the official tradition, which was no longer perceived as an effective way to communicate with Heaven. The traditions of the \u4e5d\u91ce (\"Nine Fields\") and of the ''[[Yijing]]'' flourished.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxvii\u2013xxxviii, Vol. I}} Chinese thinkers, faced with this challenge to legitimacy, diverged in a \"[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]\", each proposing its own theories for the reconstruction of the Zhou moral order.\n\n[[Confucius]] (551\u2013479 BCE) appeared in this period of political decadence and spiritual questioning. He was educated in Shang-Zhou theology, which he contributed to transmit and reformulate giving centrality to self-cultivation and agency of humans,{{sfnb|Fung|2008|p=163}} and the educational power of the self-established individual in assisting others to establish themselves (the principle of \u611b\u4eba ''\u00e0ir\u00e9n'', \"loving others\").{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=2}} As the Zhou reign collapsed, traditional values were abandoned resulting in a period of moral decline. Confucius saw an opportunity to reinforce values of compassion and tradition into society. Disillusioned with the widespread vulgarisation of the rituals to access Tian, he began to preach an ethical interpretation of traditional Zhou religion. In his view, the power of Tian is immanent, and responds positively to the sincere heart driven by humaneness and rightness, decency and altruism. Confucius conceived these qualities as the foundation needed to restore socio-political harmony. Like many contemporaries, Confucius saw ritual practices as efficacious ways to access Tian, but he thought that the crucial knot was the state of [[meditation]] that participants enter prior to engage in the ritual acts.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|p=xxxviii, Vol. I}} Confucius amended and recodified the [[Chinese classics|classical books]] inherited from the Xia-Shang-Zhou dynasties, and composed the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''.{{sfnb|Zhou|2012|p=1}}\n\nPhilosophers in the [[Warring States period]], both \"inside the square\" (focused on state-endorsed ritual) and \"outside the square\" (non-aligned to state ritual) built upon Confucius' legacy, compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', and formulated the classical metaphysics that became the lash of Confucianism. In accordance with the Master, they identified mental tranquility as the state of Tian, or the One (\u4e00 ''Y\u012b''), which in each individual is the Heaven-bestowed divine power to rule one's own life and the world. Going beyond the Master, they theorised the oneness of production and reabsorption into the cosmic source, and the possibility to understand and therefore reattain it through meditation. This line of thought would have influenced all Chinese individual and collective-political mystical theories and practices thereafter.{{sfnb|Didier|2009|pp=xxxviii\u2013xxxix, Vol. I}}\n\n==Organisation and liturgy==\n{{Further|Confucian church{{!}}Confucian churches|Chinese lineage associations{{!}}Lineage churches|Temple of Confucius}}\n{{See also|Confucian ritual religion|Holy Confucian Church}}\n[[File:\u67f3\u5dde\u5e02\u5b54\u5e99 Liuzhou Confucius Temple.jpg|thumb|left|A Temple of the God of Culture (\u6587\u5e99 ''w\u00e9nmi\u00e0o'') in [[Liuzhou]], [[Guangxi]], where [[Confucius]] is worshiped as ''W\u00e9nd\u00ec'' (\u6587\u5e1d), \"God of Culture\"]]\n[[File:Temple of the Filial Blessing in Ouhai, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China (1).jpg|thumb|left|Temple of the Filial Blessing (\u5b5d\u4f51\u5bab ''Xi\u00e0oy\u00f2ug\u014dng''), an [[ancestral temple]] of a [[lineage church]], in [[Wenzhou]], [[Zhejiang]]]]\nSince the 2000s, there has been a growing identification of the Chinese intellectual class with Confucianism.<ref name=\"Yang2010\">{{cite article|last=Yang|first=Fenggang|title=Cultural Dynamics in China: Today and in 2020|journal=Asia Policy|number=4|date=July 2007|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:-LdyJdpkQ8kJ:www.purdue.edu/crcs/itemPublications/articles/YangChina2020s.pdf+confucian+fundamentalism&hl=it&gl=it&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESize70WNJxoIIOMRBt5DEIi_y2d7zHRgHs0t1XQiaSfoaxX05HWwV5f9yKrIVmFA_nmDge95VJc6DFPpZgQfF23oBelDF6eIoOg7iKV_1cJMVWChRZTQ-uA3FSEby7dk4i5t1Nd&sig=AHIEtbS8emeoEif5P2Tuv3SApNEJDQLzNw}} p. 48</ref> In 2003, the Confucian intellectual Kang Xiaoguang published a manifesto in which he made four suggestions: Confucian education should enter official education at any level, from elementary to high school; the state should establish Confucianism as the state religion by law; Confucian religion should enter the daily life of ordinary people through standardisation and development of doctrines, rituals, organisations, churches and activity sites; the Confucian religion should be spread through non-governmental organisations.<ref name=\"Yang2010\"/> Another modern proponent of the institutionalisation of Confucianism in a [[state church]] is [[Jiang Qing (Confucian)|Jiang Qing]].{{sfnb|Chen|2012|p=175}}\n\nIn 2005, the Center for the Study of Confucian Religion was established,<ref name=\"Yang2010\"/> and ''[[guoxue]]'' started to be implemented in public schools on all levels.

(''Analects'' 2.1)\n</blockquote>\nA key Confucian concept is that in order to govern others one must first govern oneself according to the universal order. When actual, the king's personal virtue (''de'') spreads beneficent influence throughout the kingdom. This idea is developed further in the [[Great Learning]], and is tightly linked with the [[Taoism|Taoist]] concept of [[wu wei]] ({{zh|t=\u7121\u70ba|s=\u65e0\u4e3a|p=w\u00fa w\u00e9i}}): the less the king does, the more gets done. By being the \"calm center\" around which the kingdom turns, the king allows everything to function smoothly and avoids having to tamper with the individual parts of the whole.\n\nThis idea may be traced back to the ancient [[shamanism|shamanic]] beliefs of the [[king]] being the [[axis mundi|axle between the sky, human beings, and the Earth]]. The [[emperors of China]] were considered agents of Heaven, endowed with the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. They hold the power to define the hierarchy of divinities, by bestowing titles upon mountains, rivers and dead people, acknowledging them as powerful and therefore establishing their cults.{{sfnb|Feuchtwang|2016|pp=146\u2013147}}\n\n==Meritocracy==\n<blockquote>\nIn teaching, there should be no distinction of classes. (''Analects'' 15.39)\n</blockquote>\n\nAlthough Confucius claimed that he never invented anything but was only transmitting ancient knowledge (''Analects'' 7.1), he did produce a number of new ideas. Many European and American admirers such as [[Voltaire]] and [[H. G. Creel]] point to the revolutionary idea of replacing nobility of blood with nobility of virtue. ''J\u016bnz\u01d0'' (\u541b\u5b50, lit. \"lord's child\"), which originally signified the younger, non-inheriting, offspring of a noble, became, in Confucius' work, an epithet having much the same meaning and evolution as the English \"gentleman.\"\n\nA virtuous commoner who cultivates his qualities may be a \"gentleman\", while a shameless son of the king is only a \"small man.\" That he admitted students of different classes as disciples is a clear demonstration that he fought against the feudal structures that defined pre-imperial Chinese society.\n\nAnother new idea, that of [[meritocracy]], led to the introduction of the [[imperial examination]] system in China. This system allowed anyone who passed an examination to become a government officer, a position which would bring wealth and honour to the whole family. The Chinese imperial examination system started in the [[Sui dynasty]]. Over the following centuries the system grew until finally almost anyone who wished to become an official had to prove his worth by passing written government examinations. The practice of meritocracy still exists today in the Chinese cultural sphere, including [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]] and so forth.\n\n==Influence==\n\n===In 17th-century Europe===\n[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|\"Life and works of Confucius, by [[Prospero Intorcetta]], 1687]]\n\nThe works of Confucius were translated into European languages through the agency of [[Jesuit]] scholars stationed in China.{{refn|group=note|The first was [[Michele Ruggieri]] who had returned from China to Italy in 1588, and carried on translating in Latin Chinese classics, while residing in Salerno.}} [[Matteo Ricci]] was among the very earliest to report on the thoughts of Confucius, and father [[Prospero Intorcetta]] wrote about the life and works of Confucius in [[Latin]] in 1687.<ref name=\"Windows into China\">\"Windows into China,\" John Parker, p.25, {{ISBN|0-89073-050-4}}</ref>\n\nTranslations of Confucian texts influenced European thinkers of the period,<ref name=\"Mungello\">{{cite journal |last1=Mungello|first1=David E. |year= 1971|title=Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism|journal=Philosophy East and West|volume=21|issue=1|pages=3\u201322|doi=10.2307/1397760}}</ref> particularly among the [[Deists]] and other philosophical groups of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] who were interested by the integration of the system of morality of Confucius into Western civilisation.<ref name=\"Windows into China\" /><ref>[[The Eastern Origins of Western Civilisation]], John Hobson, pp 194\u2013195, {{ISBN|0-521-54724-5}}</ref>\n\nConfucianism influenced [[Gottfried Leibniz]], who was attracted to the philosophy because of its perceived similarity to his own.

These scholars have held that, if not for Confucianism's influence on these cultures, many of the people of the East Asia region would not have been able to modernise and industrialise as quickly as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and even [[China]] have done.\n\nFor example, the impact of the [[Vietnam War]] on Vietnam was devastating, but over the last few decades Vietnam has been re-developing in a very fast pace.

This did not exclude martial arts culture. Though in his own day, Confucius had rejected the practice of Martial Arts (with the exception of Archery), he did serve under rulers who used military power extensively to achieve their goals. In later centuries, Confucianism heavily influenced many educated martial artists of great influence, such as [[Sun Lutang]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://suntaichiboston.com/sun-lutang.html|title=Sun Tai Chi Institute of Boston - Sun Style Taijiquan & Qigong|author=Sun Tai Chi Institute of Boston|work=suntaichiboston.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223080456/http://suntaichiboston.com/sun-lutang.html|archivedate=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> especially from the 19th century onwards, when bare-handed martial arts in China became more widespread and had begun to more readily absorb philosophical influences from Confucianism, [[Buddhism]] and [[Daoism]]. Some argue therefore that despite Confucius' disdain with martial culture, his teachings became of much relevance to it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il/2014/08/confucianism-and-martial-arts.html|title=Cook Ding's Kitchen: Confucianism and Martial Arts|work=cookdingskitchen.blogspot.co.il}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nConfucius and Confucianism were opposed or criticised from the start, including [[Laozi]]'s philosophy and [[Mozi]]'s critique, and Legalists such as  [[Han Fei]] ridiculed the idea that virtue would lead people to be orderly. In modern times, waves of opposition and vilification showed that Confucianism, instead of taking credit for the glories of Chinese civilisation, now had to take blame for its failures. The [[Taiping Rebellion]] described Confucianism sages as well as gods in [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as devils. In the [[New Culture Movement]], [[Lu Xun]] criticised Confucianism for shaping Chinese people into the condition they had reached by the late [[Qing Dynasty]]: his criticisms are dramatically portrayed in \"[[A Madman's Diary]],\" which implies that Confucian society was cannibalistic. Leftists during the [[Cultural Revolution]] described Confucius as the representative of the class of slave owners.\n\nIn [[South Korea]], there has long been criticism. Some South Koreans believe Confucianism has not contributed to the modernisation of South Korea. For example, South Korean writer Kim Kyong-il wrote an essay {{when|date=March 2017}} entitled \"Confucius Must Die For the Nation to Live\" (\uacf5\uc790\uac00 \uc8fd\uc5b4\uc57c \ub098\ub77c\uac00 \uc0b0\ub2e4, ''gongjaga jug-eoya naraga sanda'').

She stresses the complementarity and equal importance of the male and female roles according to yin-yang theory, but she clearly accepts the dominance of the male. However, she does present education and literary power as important for women. In later dynasties, a number of women took advantage of the Confucian acknowledgment of education to become independent in thought.<ref name=Adler />\n\nIndeed, as Joseph A.

In the 16th and the 17th centuries, the earliest European arrivals in China, the Christian [[Jesuits]], considered Confucianism to be an ethical system, not a religion, and one that was compatible with Christianity.<ref name=\"Elman\">{{Harvnb|Elman|2005|p=112}}.</ref> The Jesuits, including [[Matteo Ricci]], saw Chinese rituals as \"civil rituals\" that could co-exist alongside the spiritual rituals of Catholicism.<ref name=\"Elman\"/>\n\nBy the early 18th century, this initial portrayal was rejected by the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and [[Franciscans]], creating a dispute among Catholics in [[East Asia]] that was known as the \"Rites Controversy.\"<ref name=\"Gunn\">{{Harvnb|Gunn|2003|p=108}}.</ref> The Dominicans and Franciscans argued that [[Chinese ancestral worship]] was a form of idolatry that was contradictory to the tenets of Christianity. This view was reinforced by [[Pope Benedict XIV]], who ordered a ban on Chinese rituals.<ref name=\"Gunn\"/>\n\nSome critics view Confucianism as definitely [[pantheism|pantheistic]] and [[nontheism|nontheistic]], in that it is not based on the belief in the supernatural or in a personal god existing separate from the temporal plane.{{sfnb|Adler|2014|p=12}}<ref name=\"Yang\">{{Harvnb|Yang|1961|p=26}}.</ref> Confucius views about Ti\u0101n \u5929 and about the divine providence ruling the world, can be found above (in this page) and in Analects 6:26, 7:22, and 9:12, for example. On spirituality, Confucius said to Chi Lu, one of his students: \"You are not yet able to serve men, how can you serve spirits?\"<ref name=\"Sinaiko\">{{Harvnb|Sinaiko|1998|p=176}}.</ref> Attributes such as [[ancestor worship]], [[ritual]], and [[sacrifice]] were advocated by Confucius as necessary for social harmony; these attributes may be traced to the traditional [[Chinese folk religion]].\n\nScholars recognise that classification ultimately depends on how one defines religion.

In juxtaposition, it also marks a fundamental distinction from [[western philosophy]], in which the dominant view of time is a linear progression. During the Shang, [[destiny|fate]] could be manipulated by great deities, commonly translated as gods.{{Vague|date=December 2015}} [[Ancestor worship]] was present and universally recognized. There was also human and animal sacrifice.\n\nWhen the Shang were overthrown by the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], a new political, religious and philosophical concept was introduced called the \"[[Mandate of Heaven]]\". This mandate was said to be taken when rulers became unworthy of their position and provided a shrewd justification for Zhou rule. During this period, archaeological evidence points to an increase in literacy and a partial shift away from the faith placed in [[Shangdi]] (the Supreme Being in [[traditional Chinese religion]]), with ancestor worship becoming commonplace and a more worldly orientation coming to the fore.\n\n==Overview==\nConfucianism developed during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] from the teachings of the Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] (551\u2013479 BCE), who considered himself a retransmitter of Zhou values. His philosophy concerns the fields of ethics and politics, emphasizing personal and governmental morality, correctness of social relationships, justice, traditionalism, and sincerity. The Analects stress the importance of ritual, but also the importance of 'ren', which loosely translates as 'human-heartedness,<ref>Yuli Liu, 'Confucius', in Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics, Hodder Arnold 2006 {{ISBN|0-340-90028-8}}</ref> Confucianism, along with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], is responsible for creating the world\u2019s first [[meritocracy]], which holds that one's status should be determined by education and character rather than [[ancestry]], [[wealth]], or [[friendship]].<ref name=\"Confucius\">{{cite book|author=Kung Fu Tze (Confucius)|editor=D.

Confucianism largely became the dominant philosophical school of China during the early [[Han Dynasty]] following the replacement of its contemporary, the more Taoistic [[Huang-Lao]].<ref>Civilizations of the World: The Human Adventure : To the late 1600s, Richard Greaves p176</ref> Legalism as a coherent philosophy disappeared largely due to its relationship with the unpopular authoritarian rule of [[Qin Shi Huang]], however, many of its ideas and institutions would continue to influence Chinese philosophy until the end of Imperial rule during the [[Xinhai Revolution]].\n\nMohism, though initially popular due to its emphasis on brotherly love versus harsh Qin Legalism, fell out of favour during the [[Han Dynasty]] due to the efforts of Confucians in establishing their views as political orthodoxy.  The [[Six Dynasties]] era saw the rise of the [[Xuanxue]] philosophical school and the maturation of Chinese [[Buddhism]], which had entered China from India during the Late Han Dynasties. By the time of the [[Tang dynasty]] five-hundred years after Buddhism's arrival into China, it had transformed into a thoroughly Chinese religious philosophy dominated by the school of [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]]. [[Neo-Confucianism]] became highly popular during the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Ming Dynasty]] due in large part to the eventual combination of Confucian and Zen Philosophy.\n\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries, Chinese philosophy integrated concepts from [[Western philosophy]]. Anti-[[Qing Dynasty]] revolutionaries, involved in the [[Xinhai Revolution]], saw Western philosophy as an alternative to traditional philosophical schools; students in the [[May Fourth Movement]] called for completely abolishing the old imperial institutions and practices of China.  During this era, Chinese scholars attempted to incorporate Western philosophical ideologies such as [[democracy]], [[Marxism]], [[socialism]], [[liberalism]], [[republicanism]], [[anarchism]] and [[nationalism]] into Chinese philosophy. The most notable examples are [[Sun Yat-Sen]]'s [[Three Principles of the People]] ideology and [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Maoism]], a variant of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref>'Maoism', in Essentials of Philosophy and Ethics, Hodder Arnold 2006 {{ISBN|0-340-90028-8}}</ref>  In the modern [[People's Republic of China]], the official ideology is [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s \"[[Socialist market economy|market economy socialism]]\".\n\nAlthough the People's Republic of China has been historically hostile to the philosophy of ancient China, the influences of past are still deeply ingrained in the [[Chinese culture]]. In the post-[[Chinese economic reform]] era, modern Chinese philosophy has reappeared in forms such as the ''[[New Confucianism]]''. As in [[Japan]], philosophy in China has become a melting pot of ideas. It accepts new concepts, while attempting also to accord old beliefs their due. Chinese philosophy still carries profound influence amongst the people of [[East Asia]], and even [[Southeast Asia]].\n\n==Ancient philosophy==\n\n=== Spring and Autumn period ===\n\n{{Main article|Hundred Schools of Thought}}\nAround 500 BCE, after the Zhou state weakened and China moved into the [[Spring and Autumn period]], the classic period of Chinese philosophy began. This is known as the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] (\u8af8\u5b50\u767e\u5bb6; ''zh\u016bz\u01d0 b\u01ceiji\u0101''; \"various scholars, hundred schools\"). This period is considered the golden age of Chinese philosophy. Of the many schools founded at this time and during the subsequent [[Warring States period]], the four most influential ones were [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism|Daoism]] (often spelled \"Taoism\"), [[Mohism]] and [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].\n\n==== Confucianism ====\n\n[[Image:Confucius Statue at the Confucius Temple.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Kong Fuzi ([[Latin Language|Latin]]: [[Confucius]])]]\n{{Main article|Confucianism}}\nConfucianism is a philosophical school developed from the teachings of Confucius collected and written by his disciples after his death in ''[[The Analects]]'', and in the [[Warring States period]], [[Mencius]] in ''[[The Mencius]]'' and [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]] in ''[[Xunzi (book)|The Xunzi]]''. It is a system of [[morality|moral]], [[social philosophy|social]], [[politics|political]], and [[religion|religious]] thought that has had tremendous influence on Chinese history, thought, and culture down to the 20th century. Some Westerners have considered it to have been the \"[[state religion]]\" of [[Imperial era of Chinese history|imperial China]] because of its lasting influence on Asian culture. Its influence also spread to Korea, Japan, Vietnam and many other Asian countries.\n\nConfucianism reached its peak of influence during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] Dynasties under a rebranded Confucianism called [[Neo-Confucianism]]. Confucius expanded on the already present ideas of Chinese religion and culture to reflect the time period and environment of political chaos during the [[Warring States period]]. Because Confucius embedded the Chinese culture (which has not changed much since days of his birth) so heavily into his philosophy it was able to resonate with the people of China. This high approval of Confucianism can be seen through the reverence of Confucius in modern-day China.\n\nThe major Confucian concepts include ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|r\u00e9n]]'' \u4ec1 (humanity or humaneness), ''zh\u00e8ngm\u00edng'' \u6b63\u540d ([[rectification of names]]; e.g. a ruler who rules unjustly is no longer a ruler and may be dethroned), ''zh\u014dng'' \u5fe0 (loyalty), ''xi\u00e0o'' \u5b5d ([[filial piety]]), and ''[[Li (Confucian)|li]]'' \u79ae (ritual). Confucius taught both positive and negative versions of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]]. The concepts [[Yin and Yang]] represent two opposing forces that are permanently in conflict with each other, leading to perpetual contradiction and change. The Confucian idea of \"Rid of the two ends, take the middle\" is a Chinese equivalent of [[Hegel]]'s idea of \"thesis, antithesis, and synthesis\", which is a way of reconciling opposites, arriving at some middle ground combining the best of both. Confucius heavily emphasized the idea of microcosms in society (subunits of family and community) success's were the foundations for a successful state or country. Confucius believed in the use of education to further knowledge the people in ethics, societal behavior, and reverence in other humans. With the combination of education, successful family, and his ethical teachings he believed he could govern a well established society in China.\n\n==== Daoism ====\n\n[[Image:SFEC BritMus Asia 021.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Chinese [[ceramic glaze|glaze]]d [[stoneware]] statue of a [[Daoist]] deity, from the [[Ming Dynasty]], 16th century.]]\n{{Main|Taoist philosophy}}\n[[File:BatQuaiDo_2.svg|thumb|left|200px|[[Bagua]]: Modern Taijitu with I Ching trigrams]]\n\nDaoism is a philosophy and later also developed into a religion based on the texts the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (D\u00e0o D\u00e9 J\u012bng; ascribed to [[Laozi]]) and the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'' (partly ascribed to [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]]). The character ''[[Tao|Dao]]'' \u9053 (''Dao'') literally means \"path\" or \"way\". However, in Daoism it refers more often to a meta-physical term that describes a force that encompasses the entire universe but which cannot be described nor felt. All major Chinese philosophical schools have investigated the correct ''Way'' to go about a moral life, but in Taoism it takes on the most abstract meanings, leading this school to be named after it. It advocated nonaction (''[[wu wei]]''), the strength of softness, spontaneity, and relativism. Although it serves as a rival to Confucianism, a school of active morality, this rivalry is compromised and given perspective by the idiom \"practise Confucianism on the outside, Taoism on the inside.\"\nMost of Taoism's focus is on what is perceived to be the undeniable fact that human attempts to make the world better actually make the world worse. Therefore, it is better to strive for harmony, minimising potentially harmful interference with nature or in human affairs.<ref>A source book in Chinese philosophy, Wing-tsit Chan, p137</ref>\n\n=== Warring States period ===\n\n==== Legalism ====\n{{Main article|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}\nPhilosopher [[Han Fei]] synthesized together earlier the methods of his predecessors, which famous historian [[Sima Tan]] posthumously termed Legalism. With an essential principle like \"when the epoch changed, the ways changed\", late pre-[[Han Dynasty]] reformers emphasized rule by law.\n\nIn Han Fei's philosophy, a ruler should govern his subjects by the following trinity:\n#Fa (\u6cd5 f\u01ce): law or principle.\n#Shu (\u8853 sh\u00f9): method, tactic, art, or statecraft.\n#Shi (\u52e2 sh\u00ec): legitimacy, power, or charisma.\n\nWhat has been termed by some as the intrastate Realpolitik of the Warring States period was highly progressive, and extremely critical of the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] and [[Mohism|Mohist]] schools. But that of the [[Qin Dynasty]] would be blamed for creating a [[totalitarian]] society, thereby experiencing decline. Its main motto is: \"Set clear strict laws, or deliver harsh punishment\". In Han Fei's philosophy the ruler possessed authority regarding reward and penalty, enacted through law. Shang Yang and Han Fei promoted absolute adherence to the law, regardless of the circumstances or the person. Ministers were only to be rewarded if their words were accurate to the results of their proposals. Legalism, in accordance with Shang Yang's interpretation, could encourage the state to be a [[militarism|militaristic]] [[autarky]].\n\n====Naturalists====\n\n{{Main article|School of Naturalists}}\nThe [[School of Naturalists]] or the School of Yin-yang (\u9670\u967d\u5bb6/\u9634\u9633\u5bb6; ''Y\u012bny\u00e1ngji\u0101''; ''Yin-yang-chia''; \"School of Yin-Yang\") was a [[Warring States]] era philosophy that synthesized the concepts of [[yin-yang]] and the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]];  [[Zou Yan]] is considered the founder of this school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/607826/Zou-Yan|title=Zou Yan|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=1 March 2011}}</ref> His theory attempted to explain the universe in terms of basic forces in nature: the complementary agents of yin (dark, cold, female, negative) and yang (light, hot, male, positive) and the Five Elements or Five Phases (water, fire, wood, metal, and earth). In its early days, this theory was most strongly associated with the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]] and [[Qi (state)|Qi]]. In later periods, these epistemological theories came to hold significance in both philosophy and popular belief.  This school was absorbed into Taoism's alchemic and magical dimensions as well as into the Chinese medical framework. The earliest surviving recordings of this are in the [[Mawangdui Silk Texts|Ma Wang Dui]] texts and [[Huang Di Nei Jing]].\n\n==== Mohism ====\n\n{{Main article|Mohism}}\nMohism (Moism), founded by [[Mozi]] (\u58a8\u5b50), promotes [[Mohism|universal love]] with the aim of mutual benefit. Everyone must love each other equally and impartially to avoid conflict and war. Mozi was strongly against Confucian ritual, instead emphasizing [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] survival through farming, [[fortification]], and [[Public administration|statecraft]]. Tradition is inconsistent, and human beings need an extra-traditional guide to identify which traditions are acceptable. The moral guide must then promote and encourage social behaviors that maximize general benefit. As motivation for his theory, Mozi brought in the ''Will of Heaven'', but rather than being religious his philosophy parallels [[utilitarianism]].\n\n==== Logicians ====\n\n{{Main article|School of Names}}\nThe logicians (School of Names) were concerned with logic, paradoxes, names and actuality (similar to Confucian rectification of names). The logician [[Hui Shi]] was a friendly rival to [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], arguing against Taoism in a light-hearted and humorous manner. Another logician, [[Gongsun Long]], told the famous [[When a White Horse is Not a Horse]] dialogue. This school did not thrive because the Chinese regarded [[sophistry]] and [[dialectic]] as impractical.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n==== Agriculturalists ====\n\n{{main article|Agriculturalism}}\n[[Agriculturalism]] was an early [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] social and political philosophy that advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]].<ref name=\"wp\">{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2=Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}</ref> The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of [[agriculture]], and societies are based upon \"people's natural prospensity to farm.\"<ref name=\"js\">{{cite book|last= Sellmann |first=James Daryl|year=2010 | page= 76|title=Timing and rulership in Master L\u00fc's Spring and Autumn annals|publisher=SUNY Press}}</ref>\n\nThe Agriculturalists believed that the ideal government, modeled after the semi-mythical governance of [[Shennong]], is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields, not his leadership.<ref name=\"dw\">{{cite book|last= Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011 | page= 38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}</ref> Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the [[division of labour]], arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian [[self sufficiency]].

Legalism remained influential during the early [[Han Dynasty]] under the Taoist-Realist ideology [[Huang-Lao]] until [[Emperor Wu of Han]] adopted Confucianism as official doctrine. Confucianism and Taoism became the determining forces of Chinese thought until the introduction of [[Buddhism]].\n\nConfucianism was particularly strong during the Han Dynasty, whose greatest thinker was [[Dong Zhongshu]], who integrated Confucianism with the thoughts of the Zhongshu School and the theory of the Five Elements. He also was a promoter of the New Text school, which considered Confucius as a divine figure and a spiritual ruler of China, who foresaw and started the evolution of the world towards the Universal Peace. In contrast, there was an Old Text school that advocated the use of Confucian works written in ancient language (from this comes the denomination ''Old Text'') that were so much more reliable. In particular, they refuted the assumption of Confucius as a godlike figure and considered him as the greatest sage, but simply a human and mortal\n\n==== Six Dynasties ====\nThe 3rd and 4th centuries saw the rise of the ''[[Xuanxue]]'' (mysterious learning), also called ''Neo-Taoism''. The most important philosophers of this movement were [[Wang Bi]], [[Xiang Xiu]] and [[Guo Xiang]]. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, ''ming'' and ''wuming''). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], was the concept of ''[[feng liu]]'' (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.\n\n[[Buddhism]] arrived in China around the 1st century AD, but it was not until the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties|Northern and Southern]], [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] Dynasties that it gained considerable influence and acknowledgement. At the beginning, it was considered a sort of Taoist sect. [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was far more successful in China than its rival [[Hinayana]], and both Indian schools and local Chinese sects arose from the 5th century. Two chiefly important monk philosophers were [[Sengzhao]] and [[Daosheng]]. But probably the most influential and original of these schools was the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] sect, which had an even stronger impact in Japan as the [[Zen]] sect.\n\nIn the mid-Tang Buddhism reached its peak, and reportedly there were 4,600 monasteries, 40,000 hermitages and 260,500 monks and nuns. The power of the Buddhist clergy was so great and the wealth of the monasteries so impressive, that it instigated criticism from Confucian scholars, who considered Buddhism as a foreign religion. In 845 Emperor [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang|Wuzong]] ordered the [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], confiscating the riches and returning monks and nuns to lay life. From then on, Buddhism lost much of its influence.\n\n===Schools of thought===\n\n====Xuanxue====\n{{Main article|Xuanxue}}\n[[Xuanxue]] was a philosophical school that combined elements of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] to reinterpret the ''[[Yijing]],'' ''[[Daodejing]],'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]].'' The most important philosophers of this movement were [[Wang Bi]], [[Xiang Xiu]] and [[Guo Xiang]]. The main question of this school was whether Being came before Not-Being (in Chinese, ''ming'' and ''wuming''). A peculiar feature of these Taoist thinkers, like the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]], was the concept of ''[[feng liu]]'' (lit. wind and flow), a sort of romantic spirit which encouraged following the natural and instinctive impulse.\n\n==== Chan ====\n[[Image:Zhang Shengwen.

When used in a generic sense, a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]] is generally considered to be someone who discovers the true [[Reality in Buddhism|nature of reality]].\n\nBuddhism until the 4th century A.D had it little impact on China but in the 4th century its teachings hybridized with those of Taoism.<ref name=\"Eichman2000\">{{cite book|author=Shawn Eichman|title=Taoism and the Arts of China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ame4Rl1RXMC&pg=PA45|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22785-9|pages=45\u2013}}</ref> Buddhism brought to China the idea of many hells, where sinners went, but the deceased sinners souls could be saved by pious acts.<ref name=\"Eichman2000\"/> Since Chinese traditional thought focused more on ethics rather than [[metaphysics]], the merging of Buddhist and Taoist concepts developed several schools distinct from the originating Indian schools.  The most prominent examples with philosophical merit are [[Sanlun]], [[Tiantai]], [[Huayan school|Huayan]], and [[Ch\u00e1n]] (a.k.a. Zen). They investigate [[higher consciousness|consciousness]], levels of truth, whether reality is ultimately empty, and how [[Enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] is to be achieved. Buddhism has a spiritual aspect that compliments the action of [[Neo-Confucianism]], with prominent Neo-Confucians advocating certain forms of meditation.\n\n\n==Mid to Late Imperial era philosophy==\n\n=== History ===\n[[Neo-Confucianism]] was a revived version of old Confucian principles that appeared around the [[Song dynasty]], with [[Buddhist]], [[Taoist]], and [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] features. The first philosophers, such as [[Shao Yong]], [[Zhou Dunyi]] and [[Chang Zai]], were [[cosmologists]] and worked on the [[I Ching|Yi Jing]]. The Cheng brothers, [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Cheng Hao]], are considered the founders of the two main schools of thought of Neo-Confucianism: the [[School of Principle]] the first, the [[School of Mind]] the latter. The School of Principle gained supremacy during the Song dynasty with the philosophical system elaborated by [[Zhu Xi]], which became mainstream and officially adopted by the government for the Imperial examinations under the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. [[The School of Mind]] was developed by [[Lu Jiuyuan]], Zhu Xi's main rival, but was soon forgotten. Only during the [[Ming Dynasty]] was the School of Mind revived by [[Wang Shouren]], whose influence is equal to that of Zhu Xi. This school was particularly important in Japan.\n\nDuring the [[Qing Dynasty]] many philosophers objected against Neo-Confucianism and there was a return to the Han Dynasty Confucianism, and also the reprise of the controversy between Old Text and New Text. In this period also started the penetration of Western culture, but most Chinese thought that the Westerners were maybe more advanced in technology and warfare, but that China had primacy in moral and intellectual fields.\n\n===Schools of thought===\n\n==== Neo-Confucianism ====\n{{Main article|Neo-Confucianism}}\n[[File:Zhu-xi1.gif|thumb|left|[[Zhu Xi]] leading figure in Neo-Confucianism]]\n[[File:Wang-yang-ming.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wang Yangming]] also an important figure in Neo-Confucianism]]\nDespite Confucianism losing popularity to Taoism and Buddhism, [[Neo-Confucianism]] combined those ideas into a more [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] framework. Its concepts include ''[[Li (Neo-Confucianism)|li]]'' (principle, akin to [[Plato]]'s [[Theory of forms|forms]]), ''[[qi]]'' (vital or material force), ''[[Taiji (philosophy)|taiji]]'' (the Great Ultimate), and ''[[Xin (concept)|xin]]'' (mind).

Notably, Chinese philosophy never developed the concept of [[human rights]], so that classical Chinese lacked words for them. Until 1864, [[William Alexander Parsons Martin|W.A.P. Martin]] had to invent the word ''quanli\uff08Chinese:\u6743\u5229/\u6b0a\u5229\uff09'' to translate the Western concept of \"rights\" in the process of translating [[Henry Wheaton]]'s ''[[Elements of International Law]]'' into classical Chinese.<ref>{{cite book|last=Cao|first=Deborah|title=Chinese Law: A Language Perspective|year=2004|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|pages=71\u201372}}</ref>\n\nBy the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]] in 1911, there were many calls such as the [[May Fourth Movement]] to completely abolish the old imperial institutions and practices of China.  There have been attempts to incorporate [[democracy]], [[republicanism]], and [[industrialism]] into Chinese philosophy, notably by [[Sun Yat-Sen]] at the beginning of the 20th century. [[Mao Zedong]] added [[Marxism]], [[Stalinism]], [[Chinese Marxist Philosophy]] and other [[Communism|communist]] thought.\n\nWhen the [[Communist Party of China]] [[Chinese Civil War|took over]] the reign, previous schools of thought, excepting notably [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], were denounced as backward, and later even purged during the [[Cultural Revolution]], whereas their influences on Chinese thoughts remain until today. The current government of the [[People's Republic of China]] is trying to encourage a form of [[Socialism with Chinese characteristics|market socialism]].\n\nSince the radical movement of the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese government has become much more tolerant with the practice of traditional beliefs. The [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] guarantees \"freedom of religion\" with a number of restrictions. Spiritual and philosophical institutions have been allowed to be established or re-established, as long they are not perceived to be a threat to the power of the [[Communist Party of China|CPC]]. Moreover, those organizations are heavily monitored. The influences of the past are still deeply ingrained in the Chinese culture. \n\n=== New Confucianism ===\n{{Main article|New Confucianism}}\nNew Confucianism is an [[intellectual]] movement of [[Confucianism]] that began in the early 20th century in Republican [[China]], and revived in post-[[Mao Zedong|Mao]] era [[People's Republic of China|contemporary China]].

His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era only to be suppressed in favor of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Following the victory of [[Han dynasty|Han]] over [[Chu-Han Contention|Chu]] after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction and were further developed into a system known in the West as [[Neo-Confucianism]], and later [[New Confucianism|New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism)]].\n\nConfucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the [[Chinese classic texts]] including all of the [[Five Classics]], but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. [[Aphorism]]s concerning his teachings were compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', but only many years after his death.\n\nConfucius's principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle \"Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself\", the [[Golden Rule]]. He is also a traditional deity in [[Daoism]].\n\nThroughout [[History of the world|history]], Confucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping the lives of humanity. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and still remain in today's society.<ref>{{cite web|title=Impacts on Society|url=http://ancientchinaconfucianism.weebly.com/impacts-on-society.html|website=Ancient China: Confucianism}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Life and Significance of Confucius|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/confucius.htm|website=www.sjsu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China Confucianism: Life of Confucius, Influences, Development|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/religion/confucianism/|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Etymology|Name|Titles}}\n\n==Name==\nThe name \"Confucius\" is a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] \"K\u01d2ng F\u016bz\u01d0\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b54\u592b\u5b50}}, meaning \"Master Kong\"), and was coined in the late 16th century by the early [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries to China]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}} Confucius's clan name<!-- NOT surname, as they had not yet been invented--> was \"K\u01d2ng\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b54}}; [[Old Chinese]]: &#42;{{IPA|k\u02b0\u02e4o\u014b\u0294}}), and his given name was \"Qi\u016b\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e18}}; OC: &#42;{{IPA|k\u02b7\u02b0\u0259}}).

The Ji family held the position \"Minister over the Masses\", who was also the \"Prime Minister\"; the Meng family held the position \"Minister of Works\"; and the Shu family held the position \"Minister of War\". In the winter of 505 BC, Yang Hu\u2014a retainer of the Ji family\u2014rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family. However, by the summer of 501 BC, the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu.<ref name=\"dubs49-275\">{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275}}.</ref> By then, Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings, while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness, so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government. Thus, that year (501 BC), Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town. Eventually, he rose to the position of Minister of Crime.<ref name=\"dubs49-275-6\">{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275\u2013276}}.</ref>\n\nConfucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city\u2014strongholds belonging to the three families. This way, he could establish a centralized government. However, Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself. In 500 BC, Hou Fan\u2014the governor of Hou\u2014revolted against his lord of the Shu family. Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou, a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]]. The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities. Eventually, after a year and a half, Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou, the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi, and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng. First, the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC.<ref name=\"dubs49-277\">{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277}}.</ref>\n\nSoon thereafter, Gongshan Furao or Buniu, a retainer of the Ji family, revolted and took control of the forces at Bi.<ref name=\"creel49-35-6\">{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35\u201336}}.</ref><ref name=\"duuuu46-277-8\" /> He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu.<ref name=\"dubs49-277\" /> Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered. Even though he disapproved the use of a violent revolution, the Ji family dominated the Lu state force for generations and had exiled the previous duke. Although he wanted the opportunity to put his principles into practice, Confucius gave up on this idea in the end.<ref name=creel49-35-6 /> Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke.<ref name=creel49-35>{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35}}.</ref> However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls.<ref name=duuuu46-277-8>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277\u2013278}}.</ref> Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee.<ref name=creel49-35 /><ref name=dubs49-278 />\n\nDuring the revolt by Gongshan, Zhong You (\u4ef2\u7531) had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court.<ref name=dubs49-278>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278}}.</ref> Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278\u2013279}}.</ref> When Confucius heard of the raid, he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds.<ref name=dubs49-279>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=279}}.</ref> Thereafter, the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Ji's palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace. Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels.<ref name=\"chin07-30\">{{Harvnb|Chin|2007|loc=30}}.</ref> At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family, but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke, viscounts, and court.<ref name=dubs49-279 /> The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu. Immediately after the revolt was defeated, the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground.<ref name=chin07-30 />\n\nThe attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord. Through Confucius's actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official. Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius's foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.<ref name=dubs49-279 />\n\nWhen it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family, the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so.<ref name=chin07-30 /> The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] and cause the destruction of the Meng family.<ref name=\"dubs49-279\" /> Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls.<ref name=\"dubs49-279\" />\n\nLater in 498 BC, Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground, but he did not succeed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280}}.</ref> Thus, Confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280\u2013281}}.</ref> He had made powerful enemies within the state, especially with Viscount Ji Huan, due to his successes so far.<ref name=dubs46-281>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=281}}.</ref> According to accounts in the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' and ''[[Shiji]]'', Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji, Meng, and Shu families.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riegel|1986|loc=13}}.</ref> He left the state of Lu without resigning, remaining in self-exile and unable to return as long as Viscount Ji Huan was alive.<ref name=dubs46-281 />\n\n===Exile===\n{{unreferenced|section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Journey of Confucius.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the journey of Confucius to various states between 497 BC and 484 BC.]]\nThe ''[[Shiji]]'' stated that the neighboring [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state. According to this account, Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of Lu. The duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving. Confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state.\n\nAfter Confucius's resignation, he began a long journey or set of journeys around the [[ancient Chinese states|principality states]] of north-east and central China including [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wey]], [[Song (state)|Song]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Cao (state)|Cao]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chen (state)|Chen]], and [[Cai (state)|Cai]] (and a failed attempt to go to [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]]). At the courts of these states, he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented.\n\n===Return home===\n[[File:Confuciustombqufu.jpg|thumb|200px|Tomb of Confucius in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]], [[Qufu]], [[Shandong Province]]]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', Confucius returned home to his native Lu when he was 68, after he was invited to do so by [[Ji Kangzi]], the chief minister of Lu.<ref name=return>{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&C Black|pages=27\u201328|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=confucius+return+68+lu#v=onepage&q=confucius%20return%2068%20lu&f=false|accessdate=August 13, 2015|isbn=9781441196538}}</ref> The ''Analects'' depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77 [[disciples of Confucius|disciples]] and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the [[Five Classics]].\n\nDuring his return, Confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in Lu, including [[Ji Kangzi]], on matters including governance and crime.<ref name=return/>\n\nBurdened by the loss of both his son and his favorite disciples, he died at the age of 71 or 72.

Proponents argue, however, that despite the secular nature of Confucianism's teachings, it is based on a worldview that is religious.<ref>{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Peter|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|title=Is Confucianism a Religion?|publisher=''The American Interest''|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817062142/http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|archivedate=August 17, 2015|df=}}</ref> Confucianism discusses elements of the [[Diyu|afterlife]] and views concerning [[Tian|Heaven]], but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought, such as the nature of [[Chinese soul|soul]]s. However, Confucius is said to have believed in astrology, saying: \"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\".<ref name=\"Parkers\">[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Rongo Analects 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Analects]] of Confucius]]\n\nIn the ''[[Analects]]'', Confucius presents himself as a \"transmitter who invented nothing\". He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study, and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study ({{linktext|\u5b78}}) that opens the text. Far from trying to build a systematic or [[Religious formalism|formalist]] theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the ''Annals'') or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'').\n\n===Ethics===\nOne of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules. Confucian ethics may, therefore, be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]. His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly, through [[allusion]], [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. His teachings require examination and context to be understood. A good example is found in this famous anecdote:\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5ec4\u711a\u3002\u5b50\u9000\u671d\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u50b7\u4eba\u4e4e\uff1f\u201d \u4e0d\u554f\u99ac\u3002}}\n::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court Confucius said, \"Was anyone hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses.''\n:::::::''Analects'' X.11 (tr. [[Arthur Waley|Waley]]), 10\u201313 (tr. [[James Legge|Legge]]), or X-17 (tr. [[D.C. Lau|Lau]])\n\nBy not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]].\n\nOne of his teachings was a variant of the [[Golden Rule]], sometimes called the \"[[Silver Rule]]\" owing to its negative form:\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5df1\u6240\u4e0d\u6b32\uff0c\u52ff\u65bd\u65bc\u4eba\u3002}}\n::''\"What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.\"''\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5b50\u8ca2\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u6709\u4e00\u8a00\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7d42\u8eab\u884c\u4e4b\u8005\u4e4e\uff1f\u201d\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u5176\u6055\u4e4e\uff01\u5df1\u6240\u4e0d\u6b32\u3001\u52ff\u65bd\u65bc\u4eba\u3002\u201d}}\n::''Zi Gong [a disciple] asked: \"Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?\" <br />The Master replied: \"How about 'reciprocity'! Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.\"''\n:::::::''Analects'' XV.24, tr. David Hinton\n\nOften overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge. Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge. A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption, and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness. Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.\n\nThe Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|l\u01d0]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u79ae}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that ''l\u01d0'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''l\u01d0'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of ''l\u01d0'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.\n\nIn the early Confucian tradition, ''l\u01d0'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the ''l\u01d0'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''l\u01d0'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts.\n\nIn Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''y\u00ec'' ({{lang|zh|\u7fa9}}), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity. ''Y\u00ec'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of [[selfishness|self-interest]]. While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of ''y\u00ec'' is doing the right thing for the right reason.\n\nJust as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|l\u01d0]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''y\u00ec'', so ''y\u00ec'' is linked to the core value of ''r\u00e9n'' ({{lang|zh|\u4ec1}}).''[[Ren (Confucianism)|R\u00e9n]]'' consists of 5 basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence and kindness.<ref name=\"Bonevac09-40\">{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Phillips|2009|loc=40}}.</ref> ''R\u00e9n'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as \"benevolence\" or \"humaneness\"; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it \"Goodness\" (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include \"authoritativeness\" and \"selflessness.\" Confucius's moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''r\u00e9n'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''y\u00ec''. Confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes. For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount\u2014not too much and not too little.<ref name=\"Bonevac09-40\" />\n\n===Politics===\nConfucius's political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through \"rites\" (''l\u01d0'') and people's [[natural morality]], and ''not'' by using bribery and coercion. He explained that this is one of the most important analects: \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good.\" (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u5b78}}). This \"sense of shame\" is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].\n\nConfucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u547d}}) that could unify the \"world\" ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u4e0b}}, \"all under Heaven\") and bestow peace and prosperity on the people. Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]], and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.\n\nConfucius did not believe in the concept of \"[[democracy]]\", which is itself an [[Athens|Athenian]] concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schuman|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: And the World He Created|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wb6DBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT123&lpg=PT123&dq=confucius+everyone+equal#v=onepage&q=confucius%20everyone%20equal&f=false|isbn =978-0465040575|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing [[truth]] in language, and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance. Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Violatti|first=Cristian|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|title=Confucianism|publisher=''Ancient History Encyclopedia''|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818150049/http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|archivedate=August 18, 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Ref improve section|date=August 2018}}\nConfucius's teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects.{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}} Confucius's disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Focusing the Familiar: A Translation and Philosophical Interpretation of the Zhongyong|author=Ames, Roger T. and David L.

In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|\u5b5f\u5b50}}) and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|\u8340\u5b50}}) both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius. [[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''r\u00e9n'', ''y\u00ec'', and ''l\u01d0'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training. In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism.\n\nThis realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state. A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China. [[Li Si]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin dynasty]], convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler. When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned\u2014considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.\n\nUnder the succeeding [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. Under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century. As [[Mohism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Laozi]], whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them.\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130\u20131200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death, his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam until the 19th century.\n\n[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese'', published by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] at Paris in 1687.]]\nThe works of Confucius were first translated into European languages by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] in the 16th century during the late [[Ming dynasty]].

In other temples, Confucius is represented by a memorial tablet. In 2006, the China Confucius Foundation commissioned a standard portrait of Confucius based on the [[Tang dynasty]] portrait by [[Wu Daozi]].\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:First Entrance Gate of the Temple of Confucius, Ching-hai.jpg|thumb|left|First entrance gate of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Zhenhai]]]]\n\nSoon after Confucius's death, [[Qufu]], his home town, became a place of devotion and remembrance. The [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' records that it had already become a place of pilgrimage for ministers. It is still a major destination for cultural tourism, and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples. In Sinic cultures, there are many temples where representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Laozi]], and Confucius are found together. There are also many [[Temple of Confucius|temples]] dedicated to him, which have been used for Confucian ceremonies.\n\nFollowers of Confucianism have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of Confucius ({{lang|zh|\u796d\u5b54}}) every year, using ceremonies that supposedly derived from Zhou Li ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u79ae}}) as recorded by Confucius, on the date of Confucius's birth. In the twentieth century, this tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary [[Feudalism|feudalist]] beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] is a part of the natural order. All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned. Only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume. As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance.\n\nIn Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (\u796d\u5b54) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption. While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] or [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] do in the Western world.\n\nIn [[South Korea]], a grand-scale memorial ceremony called [[Seokjeon Daeje]] is held twice a year on Confucius's birthday and the anniversary of his death, at [[Hyanggyo|Confucian academies]] across the country and [[Sungkyunkwan]] in Seoul.\n\n===Descendants===\n{{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}\n\nConfucius's descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts.

The 16th century Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] is credited with introducing complex numbers in his attempts to find solutions to [[cubic equations]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Burton|1995|p=294}}</ref>\n\nGeometrically, complex numbers extend the concept of the [[one-dimensional]] [[number line]] to the [[two-dimensional]] [[complex plane]] by using the [[horizontal axis]] for the real part and the [[vertical axis]] for the imaginary part. The complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can be identified with the point {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} in the complex plane. A complex number whose real part is zero is said to be purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]]; the points for these numbers lie on the vertical axis of the complex plane.  A complex number whose imaginary part is zero can be viewed as a real number; its point lies on the horizontal axis of the complex plane.  Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form, which associates each complex number with its distance from the origin (its magnitude) and with a particular angle known as the [[argument (complex analysis)|argument]] of this complex number.\n\n==Overview==\nComplex numbers allow solutions to certain equations that have no solutions in [[real number]]s. For example, the equation\n:<math>(x+1)^2 = -9</math>\nhas no real solution, since the square of a real number cannot be negative. Complex numbers provide a solution to this problem. The idea is to [[field extension|extend]] the real numbers with an [[Indeterminate (variable)|indeterminate]] {{math|''i''}} (sometimes called the [[imaginary unit]]) that is taken to satisfy the relation {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}, so that solutions to equations like the preceding one can be found. In this case the solutions are {{math|\u22121 + 3''i''}} and {{math|\u22121 \u2212 3''i''}}, as can be verified using the fact that {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}:\n\n:<math>((-1+3i)+1)^2 = (3i)^2 = (3^2)(i^2) = 9(-1) = -9,</math>\n:<math>((-1-3i)+1)^2 = (-3i)^2 = (-3)^2(i^2) = 9(-1) = -9.</math>\n\nAccording to [[the fundamental theorem of algebra]], all [[polynomial equation]]s with real or complex coefficients in a single variable have a solution in complex numbers.\n\n===Definition===\n\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|upright|An illustration of the [[complex plane]]. The real part of a complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''iy''}} is {{mvar|x}}, and its imaginary part is {{mvar|y}}.]]\n\nA complex number is a number of the form {{math|1=''a'' + ''bi''}}, where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers and {{math|''i''}} is an indeterminate satisfying {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}. For example, {{math|2 + 3''i''}} is a complex number.<ref>{{cite book|title=College algebra|author=Sheldon Axler|page=262|publisher=Wiley|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nA complex number may therefore be defined as a polynomial in the single indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, with the relation {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1 {{=}} 0}} imposed.  From this definition, complex numbers can be added or multiplied, using the addition and multiplication for polynomials.  Formally, the set of complex numbers is the [[quotient ring]] of the [[polynomial ring]] in the indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, by the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by the polynomial {{math|''i''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} (see [[#Construction as a quotient field|below]]).<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  The [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all complex numbers is denoted by <math>\\mathbf{C}</math> (upright bold) or <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> ([[blackboard bold]]).\n\nThe real number {{mvar|a}} is called the ''real part'' of the complex number {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}; the real number {{mvar|b}} is called the ''imaginary part'' of {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}. By this convention, the imaginary part does not include a factor of {{mvar|i}}: hence {{mvar|b}}, not {{math|''bi''}}, is the imaginary part.<ref>Complex Variables (2nd Edition), M.R. Spiegel, S.

For example,\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  \\operatorname{Re}(2 + 3i) &= 2 \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Im}(2 + 3i) &= 3.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nA real number {{mvar|a}} can be regarded as a complex number {{math|''a'' + 0''i''}} whose imaginary part is 0. A purely [[imaginary number]] {{math|''bi''}} is a complex number {{math|0 + ''bi''}} whose real part is zero. It is common to write {{mvar|a}} for {{math|''a'' + 0''i''}} and {{math|''bi''}} for {{math|0 + ''bi''}}. Moreover, when the imaginary part is negative, it is common to write {{math|''a'' \u2212 ''bi''}} with {{math|''b'' > 0}} instead of {{math|''a'' + (\u2212''b'')''i''}}, for example {{math|3 \u2212 4''i''}} instead of {{math|3 + (\u22124)''i''}}.\n\n===Cartesian form and definition via ordered pairs===\n\nA complex number can thus be identified with an [[ordered pair]] {{math|(Re(''z''),Im(''z''))}} in the Cartesian plane, an identification sometimes known as the Cartesian form of {{mvar|z}}.  In fact, a complex number can be ''defined'' as an ordered pair {{math|(''a'',''b'')}}, but then rules for addition and multiplication must also be included as part of the definition (see [[#Construction as ordered pairs|below]]).<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|author=[[Tom Apostol]]|year=1981|pages=15&ndash;16|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}</ref>  [[William Rowan Hamilton]] introduced this approach to define the complex number system.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Numbers|author=Leo Corry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2015|pages=215&ndash;216}}</ref>\n\n===Complex plane===\n{{Main|Complex plane}}\n[[File:A plus bi.svg|thumb|right|Figure 1: A complex number ''z'', plotted as a point (red) and position vector (blue) on an [[Argand diagram]]; {{math|a+b''i''}} is its ''rectangular'' expression.]]\nA complex number can be viewed as a point or [[Vector (geometric)|position vector]] in a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] called the complex plane or [[Argand diagram]] (see {{harvnb|Pedoe|1988}} and {{harvnb|Solomentsev|2001}}), named after [[Jean-Robert Argand]]. The numbers are conventionally plotted using the real part as the horizontal component, and imaginary part as vertical (see Figure 1). These two values used to identify a given complex number are therefore called its ''Cartesian'', ''rectangular'', or ''algebraic form''.\n\nA position vector may also be defined in terms of its magnitude and direction relative to the origin. These are emphasized in a complex number's ''[[#Polar form|polar form]]''. Using the polar form of the complex number in calculations may lead to a more intuitive interpretation of mathematical results. Notably, the operations of addition and multiplication take on a very natural geometric character when complex numbers are viewed as position vectors: addition corresponds to [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector addition]] while multiplication corresponds to multiplying their magnitudes and adding their arguments (i.e. the angles they make with the ''x'' axis). Viewed in this way the multiplication of a complex number by {{math|''i''}} corresponds to rotating the position vector [[orientation (geometry)|counterclockwise]] by a quarter [[turn (geometry)|turn]] ([[right angle|90\u00b0]]) about the origin: {{math|(a+b''i'')''i''}} = {{math|a''i''+b''i''}}<sup>2</sup> = {{math|-b+a''i''}}.\n\n===History in brief===\n\n:''Main section: [[#History|History]]''\n\nThe solution in radicals (without [[trigonometric functions]]) of a general cubic equation contains the square roots of [[negative numbers]] when all three roots are real numbers, a situation that cannot be rectified by factoring aided by the [[rational root test]] if the cubic is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] (the so-called [[casus irreducibilis]]). This conundrum led Italian mathematician [[Gerolamo Cardano]] to conceive of complex numbers in around 1545,<ref>{{cite book|author=Morris Kline|title=A history of mathematical thought, volume 1|page=253}}</ref> though his understanding was rudimentary.\n\nWork on the problem of general polynomials ultimately led to the [[fundamental theorem of algebra]], which shows that with complex numbers, a solution exists to every [[polynomial]] equation of degree one or higher. Complex numbers thus form an [[algebraically closed field]], where any [[polynomial]] equation has a [[Root of a function|root]].\n\nMany mathematicians contributed to the full development of complex numbers. The rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers were developed by the Italian mathematician [[Rafael Bombelli]].<ref>{{harvtxt|Katz|2004|loc=\u00a79.1.4}}</ref> A more abstract formalism for the complex numbers was further developed by the Irish mathematician [[William Rowan Hamilton]], who extended this abstraction to the theory of [[quaternions]].\n\n===Notation===\n\nBecause it is a polynomial in the indeterminate {{math|''i''}}, {{math|''a'' + ''ib''}} may be written instead of {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}, which is often expedient when {{math|''b''}} is a radical.<ref>For example {{harvtxt|Ahlfors|1979}}.</ref> In some disciplines, in particular [[electromagnetism]] and [[electrical engineering]], {{math|''j''}} is used instead of {{math|''i''}},<ref>{{Citation |last1=Brown |first1=James Ward |last2=Churchill |first2=Ruel V. |title=Complex variables and applications |year=1996 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=0-07-912147-0 |edition=6th |page=2 |quote=In electrical engineering, the letter ''j'' is used instead of ''i''.}}</ref> since {{mvar|i}} is frequently used for [[electric current]]. In these cases complex numbers are written as {{math|''a'' + ''bj''}} or {{math|''a'' + ''jb''}}.\n\n==Equality and order relations==\n\nTwo complex numbers are equal [[iff|if and only if]] both their real and imaginary parts are equal. That is, complex numbers <math>z_1</math> and <math>z_2</math> are equal if and only if \n<math>\\operatorname{Re}(z_{1}) = \\operatorname{Re}(z_{2})</math> and <math>\\operatorname{Im} (z_{1}) = \\operatorname{Im} (z_{2})</math>.  If the complex numbers are written in polar form, they are equal if and only if they have the same argument and the same magnitude.\n\nBecause complex numbers are naturally thought of as existing on a two-dimensional plane, there is no natural [[linear ordering]] on the set of complex numbers.  Furthermore, there is no [[linear ordering]] on the complex numbers that is compatible with addition and multiplication &ndash; the complex numbers cannot have the structure of an [[ordered field]]. This is because any square in an ordered field is at least {{math|0}}, but {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121}}.\n\n==Elementary operations==\n\n===Conjugate===\n{{See also|Complex conjugate}}\n[[File:Complex conjugate picture.svg|right|thumb|Geometric representation of {{mvar|z}} and its conjugate <math>\\overline{z}</math> in the complex plane]]\nThe ''[[complex conjugate]]'' of the complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} is given by {{math|''x'' \u2212 ''yi''}}. It is denoted by either <math>\\overline{z}</math> or {{math|''z''*}}.<ref>For the former notation, see for instance {{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|author=[[Tom Apostol]]|year=1981|pages=15&ndash;16|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}.</ref> This [[unary operation]] on complex numbers cannot be expressed by applying only their basic operations addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nGeometrically, <math>\\overline{z}</math> is the [[reflection symmetry|\"reflection\"]] of {{mvar|z}} about the real axis. Conjugating twice gives the original complex number\n:<math>\\overline{\\overline{z}}=z,</math>\n\nwhich makes this operation an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]. The reflection leaves both the real part and the magnitude of <math>z</math> unchanged, that is\n:<math>\\operatorname{Re}(\\overline{z}) = \\operatorname{Re}(z)\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad |\\overline{z}| = |z|.</math>\n\nThe imaginary part and the argument of a complex number <math>z</math> change their sign under conjugation\n:<math>\\operatorname{Im}(\\overline{z}) = -\\operatorname{Im}(z)\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{arg}(\\overline{z}) \\equiv -\\operatorname{arg}(z) \\pmod {2\\pi}.</math>\n\nFor details on argument and magnitude see [[#Polar form]].\n\nThe product of a complex number <math>z= x + yi</math> and its conjugate is always a positive real number and equals the square of the magnitude of each:\n:<math>z\\cdot \\overline{z} = x^2 + y^2.</math> \n\nThis property can be used used to convert a fraction with a complex denominator to an equivalent fraction with a real denominator by expanding both numerator and denominator of the fraction by the conjugate of the given denominator. This process is sometimes called \"[[rationalisation (mathematics)|rationalization]]\" of the denominator (although the denominator in the final expression might be an irrational real number), because it resembles the method to remove roots from simple expressions in a denominator.\n\nThe real and imaginary parts of a complex number {{mvar|z}} can be extracted using the conjugation:\n: <math>\\operatorname{Re}(z) = \\dfrac{z+\\overline{z}}{2},\\quad</math> and <math>\\quad \\operatorname{Im}(z) = \\dfrac{z-\\overline{z}}{2i}.</math>\nMoreover, a complex number is real if and only if it equals its own conjugate.\n\nConjugation distributes over the basic complex arithmetic operations:\n: <math>\\overline{z\\pm w} = \\overline{z} \\pm \\overline{w},</math>\n: <math>\\overline{z\\cdot w} = \\overline{z} \\cdot\\overline{w},\\quad \\overline{z/w} = \\overline{z}/\\overline{w}.</math>\n\nConjugation is also employed in [[Inversive geometry]], a branch of geometry studying reflections more general than ones about a line. In the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis of electrical circuits]], the complex conjugate is used in finding the equivalent impedance when the [[maximum power transfer theorem]] is looked for.\n\n===Addition and subtraction===\n[[File:Vector Addition.svg|200px|right|thumb|Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram.]]\n\nTwo complex numbers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> are most easily [[addition|added]] by separately adding their real and imaginary parts of the summands. That is to say:\n:<math>a + b =(x+yi) + (u+vi) = (x+u) + (y+v)i.</math>\nSimilarly, [[subtraction]] can be performed as\n:<math>a - b =(x+yi) - (u+vi) = (x-u) + (y-v)i.</math>\n\nUsing the visualization of complex numbers in the complex plane, the addition has the following geometric interpretation: the sum of two complex numbers <math>a</math> and <math>b</math>, interpreted as points in the complex plane, is the point obtained by building a [[parallelogram]] from the three vertices <math>O</math>, and the points of the arrows labeled <math>a</math> and <math>b</math> (provided that they are not on a line). Equivalently, calling these points <math>A,\\; B,</math> respectively and the fourth point of the parallelogram <math>X,</math> the [[triangle]]s <math>OAB</math> and <math>XBA</math> are [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]]. A visualization of the subtraction can be achieved by considering addition of the negative [[subtrahend]].\n\n===Multiplication===\nSince the the real part, the imaginary part, and the indeterminate <math>i</math> in a complex number are all considered as numbers in themselves, two complex numbers, given as <math>z=x+yi</math> and <math>w= u+vi</math> are multiplied under the rules of the [[distributive property]], the [[commutative property|commutative properties]] and the defining property <math>i^2 = -1</math> in the following way\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nz\\cdot w &= (x+yi)\\cdot (u+vi)  & \\\\\n&=x(u+vi) + yi(u+vi)  &&\\text{by the (right) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + xvi + yiu + yivi &&\\text{by the (left) distributive law} \\\\\n&=xu + yivi + xvi + yiu &&\\text{by the commutativity of addition} \\\\ \n&=xu + yvi^2 + xvi + yui &&\\text{by the commutativity of multiplication} \\\\ \n&=(xu + yvi^2) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the associativity of addition} \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xvi + yui) &&\\text{by the defining property of } i \\\\\n&=(xu - yv) + (xv + yu)i &&\\text{by the distributive law}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Reciprocal and division===\nUsing the conjugation, the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of a nonzero complex number {{math|1=''z'' = ''x'' + ''yi''}} can always be broken down to\n: <math>\\frac{1}{z}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{z \\overline{z}} = \\frac{\\overline{z}}{|z|^2}=\\frac{\\overline{z}}{x^2+y^2}=\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i,</math>\n\nsince ''non-zero'' implies that <math>x^2 + y^2</math> is greater than zero.\n\nThis can be used to express a division of an arbitrary complex number <math>w= u+vi</math> by a non-zero complex number <math>z</math> as\n:<math>\\frac {w}{z}= w\\cdot \\frac {1}{z}= (u+vi)\\cdot \\left(\\frac{x}{x^2+y^2} -\\frac{y}{x^2+y^2}i\\right)= \\frac{1}{x^2+y^2}\\left((ux+vy)+(vx-uy)i\\right).</math>\n\n===Square root===\n{{see also|Square root#Square roots of negative and complex numbers|l1=Square roots of negative and complex numbers}}\nThe square roots of {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} (with {{math|''b'' \u2260 0}}) are <math> \\pm (\\gamma + \\delta i)</math>, where\n\n:<math>\\gamma = \\sqrt{\\frac{a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}}</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\delta = \\sgn (b) \\sqrt{\\frac{-a + \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}},</math>\n\nwhere sgn is the [[sign function|signum]] function.

It can increase by any integer multiple of {{math|2\u03c0}} and still give the same angle. Hence, the arg function is sometimes considered as [[Multivalued function|multivalued]].

As the [[arctan]] function can be approximated highly efficiently, formulas like this&mdash;known as [[Machin-like formulas]]&mdash;are used for high-precision approximations of [[pi|\u03c0]].\n\nSimilarly, division is given by\n:<math>\\frac{z_1}{ z_2} = \\frac{r_1}{ r_2} \\left(\\cos(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2) + i \\sin(\\varphi_1 - \\varphi_2)\\right).</math>\n\n==Exponentiation {{anchor|Exponentiation}}==\n\n===Euler's formula===\n[[Euler's formula]] states that, for any real number {{mvar|x}},\n\n: <math>e^{ix} = \\cos x + i\\sin x \\ </math>,\n\nwhere {{math|''e''}} is the [[e (mathematical constant)|base of the natural logarithm]]. This can be proved through induction by observing that\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\ni^0 &{}= 1, \\quad &\ni^1 &{}= i, \\quad &\ni^2 &{}= -1, \\quad &\ni^3 &{}= -i, \\\\\ni^4 &={} 1, \\quad &\ni^5 &={} i, \\quad &\ni^6 &{}= -1, \\quad &\ni^7 &{}= -i,\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand so on, and by considering the [[Taylor series]] expansions of {{math|''e''<sup>''ix''</sup>}}, {{math|cos ''x''}} and {{math|sin ''x''}}:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n e^{ix} &{}= 1 + ix + \\frac{(ix)^2}{2!} + \\frac{(ix)^3}{3!} + \\frac{(ix)^4}{4!} + \\frac{(ix)^5}{5!} + \\frac{(ix)^6}{6!} + \\frac{(ix)^7}{7!} + \\frac{(ix)^8}{8!} + \\cdots \\\\[8pt]\n        &{}= 1 + ix - \\frac{x^2}{2!} - \\frac{ix^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} + \\frac{ix^5}{5!} -\\frac{x^6}{6!} - \\frac{ix^7}{7!} + \\frac{x^8}{8!} + \\cdots \\\\[8pt]\n        &{}= \\left( 1 - \\frac{x^2}{2!} + \\frac{x^4}{4!} - \\frac{x^6}{6!} + \\frac{x^8}{8!} - \\cdots \\right) + i\\left( x - \\frac{x^3}{3!} + \\frac{x^5}{5!} - \\frac{x^7}{7!} + \\cdots \\right) \\\\[8pt]\n        &{}= \\cos x + i\\sin x \\ .\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe rearrangement of terms is justified because each series is [[absolute convergence|absolutely convergent]].\n\n===Natural logarithm===\n\nIt follows from Euler's formula that, for any complex number ''z'' written in polar form,\n\n:<math> z = r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi )</math>\n\nwhere ''r'' is a non-negative real number, one possible value for the [[complex logarithm]] of ''z'' is\n\n:<math> \\ln (z)= \\ln(r) + \\varphi i.</math>\n\nBecause cosine and sine are periodic functions,  other possible values may be obtained. For example, <math>e^{i\\pi} = e^{3i\\pi} = -1</math>, \nso both <math>i \\pi</math> and <math>3i\\pi</math> are two possible values for the natural logarithm of <math>-1</math>.\n\nTo deal with the existence of more than one possible value for a given input, the complex logarithm may be considered a multi-valued function, with\n\n:<math> \\ln(z) = \\left\\{ \\ln(r) + (\\varphi + 2\\pi k)i \\;|\\; k \\in \\mathbb{Z}\\right\\}.</math>\n\nAlternatively, a [[branch cut]] can be used to define a single-valued \"branch\" of the complex logarithm.\n\n===Integer and fractional exponents===\nWe may use the identity\n\n:<math> \\ln(a^{b}) = b \\ln(a)</math>\n\nto define complex exponentiation, which is likewise multi-valued:\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\ln (z^n) &= \\ln((r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ))^{n}) \\\\\n              &= n \\ln(r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi)) \\\\\n              &= \\{ n (\\ln(r) + (\\varphi + k2\\pi) i) \\ | \\ k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\} \\\\\n              &= \\{ n \\ln(r) + n \\varphi i + nk2\\pi i \\ | \\ k \\in \\mathbb{Z} \\}.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nWhen ''n'' is an integer, this simplifies to [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n\n:<math> z^{n}=(r(\\cos \\varphi + i\\sin \\varphi ))^{n} = r^n \\cdot (\\cos n\\varphi + i \\sin n \\varphi).</math>\n\nThe {{mvar|n}}th [[Nth root|roots]] of {{mvar|z}} are given by\n:<math>\\sqrt[n]{z} = \\sqrt[n]r \\left( \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right) + i \\sin \\left(\\frac{\\varphi+2k\\pi}{n}\\right)\\right)</math>\nfor any integer {{math|''k''}} satisfying {{math|0 \u2264 ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' \u2212 1}}. Here {{radic|''r''|''n''}} is the usual (positive) {{mvar|n}}th root of the positive real number {{mvar|r}}. While the {{mvar|n}}th root of a positive real number {{mvar|r}} is chosen to be the ''positive'' real number {{mvar|c}} satisfying {{math|1=''c''<sup>''n''</sup> = ''r''}} there is no natural way of distinguishing one particular complex {{mvar|n}}th root of a complex number. Therefore, the {{mvar|n}}th root of {{mvar|z}} is considered as a [[multivalued function]] (in {{mvar|z}}), as opposed to a usual function {{mvar|f}}, for which {{math|''f''(''z'')}} is a uniquely defined number. Formulas such as\n:<math>\\sqrt[n]{z^n} = z</math>\n(which holds for positive real numbers), do in general not hold for complex numbers.\n\n==Properties==\n\n===Field structure===\nThe set '''C''' of complex numbers is a [[field (mathematics)|field]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|author=[[Tom Apostol]]|year=1981|pages=15&ndash;16|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}</ref> Briefly, this means that the following facts hold: first, any two complex numbers can be added and multiplied to yield another complex number. Second, for any complex number {{mvar|z}}, its [[additive inverse]] {{math|&minus;''z''}} is also a complex number; and third, every nonzero complex number has a [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] complex number. Moreover, these operations satisfy a number of laws, for example the law of [[commutativity]] of addition and multiplication for any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}:\n:<math>z_1+ z_2 = z_2 + z_1,</math>\n:<math>z_1 z_2 = z_2 z_1.</math>\nThese two laws and the other requirements on a field can be proven by the formulas given above, using the fact that the real numbers themselves form a field.\n\nUnlike the reals, '''C''' is not an [[ordered field]], that is to say, it is not possible to define a relation {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub> < ''z''<sub>2</sub>}} that is compatible with the addition and multiplication. In fact, in any ordered field, the square of any element is necessarily positive, so {{math|1=''i''<sup>2</sup> = &minus;1}} precludes the existence of an [[total order|ordering]] on '''C'''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|author=[[Tom Apostol]]|year=1981|page=25|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}</ref>\n\nWhen the underlying field for a mathematical topic or construct is the field of complex numbers, the topic's name is usually modified to reflect that fact. For example: [[complex analysis]], complex [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], complex [[polynomial]], and complex [[Lie algebra]].\n\n===Solutions of polynomial equations===\nGiven any complex numbers (called [[coefficient]]s) {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, the equation\n:<math>a_n z^n + \\dotsb + a_1 z + a_0 = 0</math>\nhas at least one complex solution ''z'', provided that at least one of the higher coefficients {{math|''a''<sub>1</sub>,\u2009\u2026,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} is nonzero.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>  This is the statement of the ''[[fundamental theorem of algebra]]'', of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]]. Because of this fact, '''C''' is called an [[algebraically closed field]]. This property does not hold for the [[rational number|field of rational numbers]] '''Q''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2}} does not have a rational root, since [[square root of 2|{{sqrt|2}}]] is not a rational number) nor the real numbers '''R''' (the polynomial {{math|''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''a''}} does not have a real root for {{math|''a'' > 0}}, since the square of {{mvar|x}} is positive for any real number {{mvar|x}}).\n\nThere are various proofs of this theorem, either by analytic methods such as [[Liouville's theorem (complex analysis)|Liouville's theorem]], or [[topology|topological]] ones such as the [[winding number]], or a proof combining [[Galois theory]] and the fact that any real polynomial of ''odd'' degree has at least one real root.\n\nBecause of this fact, theorems that hold ''for any algebraically closed field'', apply to '''C'''. For example, any non-empty complex [[square matrix]] has at least one (complex) [[eigenvalue]].\n\n===Algebraic characterization===\nThe field '''C''' has the following three properties: first, it has [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. This means that {{math|1=1 + 1 + \u22ef + 1 \u2260 0}} for any number of summands (all of which equal one). Second, its [[transcendence degree]] over '''Q''', the [[prime field]] of '''C''', is the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. Third, it is [[algebraically closed]] (see above). It can be shown that any field having these properties is [[isomorphic]] (as a field) to '''C'''. For example, the [[algebraic closure]] of [[p-adic numbers|'''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>]] also satisfies these three properties, so these two fields are isomorphic (as fields, but not as topological fields).<ref>{{citation\n | last = Marker | first = David\n | editor1-last = Marker | editor1-first = D.\n | editor2-last = Messmer | editor2-first = M.\n | editor3-last = Pillay | editor3-first = A.\n | contribution = Introduction to the Model Theory of Fields\n | contribution-url = https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.lnl/1235423155\n | isbn = 3-540-60741-2\n | mr = 1477154\n | pages = 1\u201337\n | publisher = Springer-Verlag | location = Berlin\n | series = Lecture Notes in Logic\n | title = Model theory of fields\n | volume = 5\n | year = 1996}}</ref> Also, '''C''' is isomorphic to the field of complex [[Puiseux series]]. However, specifying an isomorphism requires the [[axiom of choice]]. Another consequence of this algebraic characterization is that '''C''' contains many proper subfields that are isomorphic to '''C'''.\n\n===Characterization as a topological field===\nThe preceding characterization of '''C''' describes only the algebraic aspects of '''C'''. That is to say, the properties of [[neighborhood (topology)|nearness]] and [[continuity (topology)|continuity]], which matter in areas such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[topology]], are not dealt with. The following description of '''C''' as a [[topological ring|topological field]] (that is, a field that is equipped with a [[topological space|topology]], which allows the notion of convergence) does take into account the topological properties. '''C''' contains a subset {{math|''P''}} (namely the set of positive real numbers) of nonzero elements satisfying the following three conditions:\n* {{math|''P''}} is closed under addition, multiplication and taking inverses.\n* If {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are distinct elements of {{math|''P''}}, then either {{math|''x'' &minus; ''y''}} or {{math|''y'' &minus; ''x''}} is in {{math|''P''}}.\n* If {{mvar|S}} is any nonempty subset of {{math|''P''}}, then {{math|1=''S'' + ''P'' = ''x'' + ''P''}} for some {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\nMoreover, '''C''' has a nontrivial [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[automorphism]] {{math|''x'' \u21a6 ''x''*}} (namely the complex conjugation), such that {{math|''x\u2009x''*}} is in {{math|''P''}} for any nonzero {{mvar|x}} in '''C'''.\n\nAny field {{mvar|F}} with these properties can be endowed with a topology by taking the sets {{math|1= ''B''(''x'',\u2009''p'') = {\u2009''y'' {{!}} ''p'' &minus; (''y'' &minus; ''x'')(''y'' &minus; ''x'')* \u2208 ''P''\u2009}\u2009}} as a [[base (topology)|base]], where {{mvar|x}} ranges over the field and {{mvar|p}} ranges over {{math|''P''}}. With this topology {{mvar|F}} is isomorphic as a ''topological'' field to '''C'''.\n\nThe only [[connected space|connected]] [[locally compact]] [[topological ring|topological fields]] are '''R''' and '''C'''. This gives another characterization of '''C''' as a topological field, since '''C''' can be distinguished from '''R''' because the nonzero complex numbers are [[connected space|connected]], while the nonzero real numbers are not.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=General topology|section=VIII.4|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>\n\n==Formal construction==\n===Construction as ordered pairs===\nThe set {{math|'''C'''}} of complex numbers can be defined as the set {{math|'''R'''<sup>2</sup>}} of [[ordered pair]]s {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} of real numbers, in which the following rules for addition and multiplication are imposed:<ref>{{cite book|title=Mathematical analysis|author=[[Tom Apostol]]|year=1981|pages=15&ndash;16|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}</ref>\n\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n(a, b) + (c, d) &= (a + c, b + d)\\\\\n(a, b) \\cdot (c, d) &= (ac - bd, bc + ad).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIt is then just a matter of notation to express {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} as {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}.\n\n===Construction as a quotient field===\nThough this low-level construction does accurately describe the structure of the complex numbers, the following equivalent definition reveals the algebraic nature of {{math|'''C'''}} more immediately. This characterization relies on the notion of fields and polynomials. A field is a set endowed with addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations that behave as is familiar from, say, rational numbers. For example, the [[distributive law]]\n:<math>(x+y) z = xz + yz</math>\nmust hold for any three elements {{mvar|x}}, {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}} of a field. The set {{math|'''R'''}} of real numbers does form a field. A polynomial {{math|''p''(''X'')}} with real [[coefficient]]s is an expression of the form\n:<math>a_nX^n+\\dotsb+a_1X+a_0</math>,\nwhere the {{math|''a''<sub>0</sub>, ...,\u2009''a''<sub>''n''</sub>}} are real numbers. The usual addition and multiplication of polynomials endows the set {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}} of all such polynomials with a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] structure. This ring is called the [[polynomial ring]] over the real numbers.\n\nThe set of complex numbers is defined as the [[quotient ring]] {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}}.<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Nicolas Bourbaki]]|title=General topology|section=VIII.1|publisher=Springer-Verlag}}</ref>   This extension field contains two square roots of {{math|\u22121}}, namely (the [[coset]]s of) {{math|''X''}} and {{math|\u2212''X''}}, respectively. (The cosets of) {{math|1}} and {{math|''X''}} form a basis of {{math|'''R'''[''X'']/(''X'' <sup>2</sup> + 1)}} as a real [[vector space]], which means that each element of the extension field can be uniquely written as a [[linear combination]] in these two elements. Equivalently, elements of the extension field can be written as ordered pairs {{math|(''a'',\u2009''b'')}} of real numbers.  The quotient ring is a field, because {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> + 1}} is [[Irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over {{math|'''R'''}}, so the ideal it generates is [[Maximal ideal|maximal]].\n\nThe formulas for addition and multiplication in the ring {{math|'''R'''[''X'']}}, modulo the relation {{math|''X''<sup>2</sup> {{=}} 1}}, correspond to the formulas for addition and multiplication of complex numbers defined as ordered pairs.  So the two definitions of the field {{math|'''C'''}} are [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] (as fields).\n\nAccepting that {{math|'''C'''}} is algebraically closed, since it is an [[algebraic extension]] of {{math|'''R'''}} in this approach, {{math|'''C'''}} is therefore the [[algebraic closure]] of {{math|'''R'''}}.\n\n===Matrix representation of complex numbers===<!-- .This section is linked from [[Cauchy-Riemann equations]] -->\nComplex numbers {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}} can also be represented by {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] that have the following form:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nHere the entries {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are real numbers. The sum and product of two such matrices is again of this form, and the sum and product of complex numbers corresponds to the sum and [[matrix multiplication|product]] of such matrices, the product being:\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  a &   -b  \\\\\n  b & \\;\\; a\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  c &   -d  \\\\\n  d & \\;\\; c\n\\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n  ac-bd &   -ad-bc  \\\\\n  bc+ad & \\;\\; -bd+ac\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\n\nThe geometric description of the multiplication of complex numbers can also be expressed in terms of [[rotation matrix|rotation matrices]] by using this correspondence between complex numbers and such matrices. Moreover, the square of the absolute value of a complex number expressed as a matrix is equal to the [[determinant]] of that matrix:\n:<math> |z|^2 =\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n  a & -b  \\\\\n  b &  a\n\\end{vmatrix}\n= a^2 + b^2.\n</math>\nThe conjugate <math>\\overline z</math> corresponds to the [[transpose]] of the matrix.\n\nThough this representation of complex numbers with matrices is the most common, many other representations arise from matrices ''other than'' <math>\\bigl(\\begin{smallmatrix}0 & -1 \\\\1 & 0 \\end{smallmatrix}\\bigr)</math> that square to the negative of the [[identity matrix]]. See the article on [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]] for other representations of complex numbers.\n\n==Complex analysis==\n[[File:Sin1perz.png|thumb|270px|[[Domain coloring|Color wheel graph]] of {{math|sin(1/''z'')}}. Black parts inside refer to numbers having large absolute values.]]\n{{main|Complex analysis}}\n<!--\n[[File:Color complex plot.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Domain coloring]] plot of the function\n<BR/><math>f(x) = \\tfrac{(x^2 - 1)(x - 2 - i)^2}{x^2 + 2 + 2 i}</math><BR/>\nThe hue represents the function argument, while the saturation and [[Lightness (color)|value]] represent the magnitude.]]\n\nThe absolute value has three important properties:\n\n:<math> | z | \\geq 0, \\,</math> where <math> | z | = 0 \\,</math> [[if and only if]] <math> z = 0</math>\n\n:<math> | z + w | \\leq | z | + | w | \\,</math> ([[triangle inequality]])\n\n:<math> | z \\cdot w | = | z | \\cdot | w | </math>\n\nfor all complex numbers {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}. These imply that {{math|1={{!}}\u20091\u2009{{!}} = 1}} and {{math|1={{!}}\u2009''z''/''w''\u2009{{!}} = {{!}}\u2009''z''\u2009{{!}}/{{!}}\u2009''w''\u2009{{!}}}}. By defining the '''distance''' function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}\u2009''z'' \u2212 ''w''\u2009{{!}}}}, we turn the set of complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and we can therefore talk about [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]].\n\nIn general, distances between complex numbers are given by the distance function {{math|1=''d''(''z'',\u2009''w'') = {{!}}\u2009''z'' \u2212 ''w''\u2009{{!}}}}, which turns the complex numbers into a [[metric space]] and introduces the ideas of [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and [[continuous function|continuity]]. All of the standard properties of two dimensional space therefore hold for the complex numbers, including important properties of the modulus such as non-negativity, and the [[triangle inequality]] (<math>| z + w | \\leq | z | + | w |</math> for all {{mvar|z}} and {{mvar|w}}).\n\n-->\n\nThe study of functions of a complex variable is known as [[complex analysis]] and has enormous practical use in [[applied mathematics]] as well as in other branches of mathematics. Often, the most natural proofs for statements in [[real analysis]] or even [[number theory]] employ techniques from complex analysis (see [[prime number theorem]] for an example). Unlike real functions, which are commonly represented as two-dimensional graphs, [[complex function]]s have four-dimensional graphs and may usefully be illustrated by color-coding a [[graph of a function of two variables|three-dimensional graph]] to suggest four dimensions, or by animating the complex function's dynamic transformation of the complex plane.\n\n===Complex exponential and related functions===\nThe notions of [[convergent series]] and [[continuous function]]s in (real) analysis have natural analogs in complex analysis. A sequence <!--(''a''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' &ge; 0</sub>--> of complex numbers is said to [[convergent sequence|converge]] if and only if its real and imaginary parts do. This is equivalent to the [[(\u03b5, \u03b4)-definition of limit]]s, where the absolute value of real numbers is replaced by the one of complex numbers. From a more abstract point of view, '''C''', endowed with the [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]\n:<math>\\operatorname{d}(z_1, z_2) = |z_1 - z_2|</math>\nis a complete [[metric space]], which notably includes the [[triangle inequality]]\n:<math>|z_1 + z_2| \\le |z_1| + |z_2|</math>\nfor any two complex numbers {{math|''z''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''z''<sub>2</sub>}}.\n\nLike in real analysis, this notion of convergence is used to construct a number of [[elementary function]]s: the ''[[exponential function]]'' {{math|exp(''z'')}}, also written {{math|''e''<sup>''z''</sup>}}, is defined as the [[infinite series]]\n:<math>\\exp(z):= 1+z+\\frac{z^2}{2\\cdot 1}+\\frac{z^3}{3\\cdot 2\\cdot 1}+\\cdots = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{z^n}{n!}. </math>\n\nThe series defining the real trigonometric functions [[sine]] and [[cosine]], as well as the [[hyperbolic functions]] sinh and cosh, also carry over to complex arguments without change. For the other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, such as [[tangent (function)|tangent]], things are slightly more complicated, as the defining series do not converge for all complex values. Therefore, one must define them either in terms of sine, cosine and exponential, or, equivalently, by using the method of [[analytic continuation]].\n\n''[[Euler's formula]]'' states:\n:<math>\\exp(i\\varphi) = \\cos(\\varphi) + i\\sin(\\varphi) </math>\nfor any real number ''&phi;'', in particular\n:<math>\\exp(i \\pi) = -1 </math>\nUnlike in the situation of real numbers, there is an [[infinite set|infinitude]] of complex solutions {{mvar|z}} of the equation\n:<math>\\exp(z) = w </math>\nfor any complex number {{math|''w'' &ne; 0}}. It can be shown that any such solution {{mvar|z}}&mdash;called [[complex logarithm]] of {{mvar|w}}&mdash;satisfies\n:<math>\\log(w)=\\ln|w| + i\\arg(w), </math>\nwhere arg is the [[arg (mathematics)|argument]] defined [[#Polar form|above]], and ln the (real) [[natural logarithm]]. As arg is a [[multivalued function]], unique only up to a multiple of 2''\u03c0'', log is also multivalued. The [[principal value]] of log is often taken by restricting the imaginary part to the [[interval (mathematics)|interval]] {{open-closed|&minus;\u03c0,\u03c0}}.\n\nComplex [[exponentiation]] {{math|''z''<sup>''\u03c9''</sup>}} is defined as\n:<math>z^\\omega = \\exp(\\omega \\log z), </math>\nand is multi-valued, except when <math>\\omega</math> is an integer. For {{math|1=''\u03c9'' = 1 / ''n''}}, for some natural number {{mvar|n}}, this recovers the non-uniqueness of {{mvar|n}}th roots mentioned above.\n\nComplex numbers, unlike real numbers, do not in general satisfy the unmodified power and logarithm identities, particularly when na\u00efvely treated as single-valued functions; see [[Exponentiation#Failure of power and logarithm identities|failure of power and logarithm identities]]. For example, they do not satisfy\n:<math>a^{bc} = (a^b)^c.</math>\nBoth sides of the equation are multivalued by the definition of complex exponentiation given here, and the values on the left are a subset of those on the right.\n\n===Holomorphic functions===\nA function ''f''&thinsp;: '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' is called [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] if it satisfies the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]]. For example, any [[Linear transformation#Definition and first consequences|'''R'''-linear]] map '''C''' \u2192 '''C''' can be written in the form\n:<math>f(z)=az+b\\overline{z}</math>\nwith complex coefficients {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}. This map is holomorphic [[if and only if]] {{math|1=''b'' = 0}}. The second summand <math>b \\overline z</math> is real-differentiable, but does not satisfy the [[Cauchy\u2013Riemann equations]].\n\nComplex analysis shows some features not apparent in real analysis. For example, any two holomorphic functions {{mvar|f}} and {{mvar|g}} that agree on an arbitrarily small [[open subset]] of '''C''' necessarily agree everywhere. [[Meromorphic function]]s, functions that can locally be written as {{math|''f''(''z'')/(''z'' &minus; ''z''<sub>0</sub>)<sup>''n''</sup>}} with a holomorphic function {{mvar|f}}, still share some of the features of holomorphic functions. Other functions have [[essential singularity|essential singularities]], such as {{math|sin(1/''z'')}} at {{math|1=''z'' = 0}}.\n\n==Applications==\nComplex numbers have essential concrete applications in a variety of scientific and related areas such as [[signal processing]], [[control theory]], [[electromagnetism]], [[fluid dynamics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[cartography]], and [[Vibration#Vibration analysis|vibration analysis]]. Some applications of complex numbers are:\n\n===Control theory===\nIn [[control theory]], systems are often transformed from the [[time domain]] to the [[frequency domain]] using the [[Laplace transform]]. The system's [[zeros and poles]] are then analyzed in the ''complex plane''. The [[root locus]], [[Nyquist plot]], and [[Nichols plot]] techniques all make use of the complex plane.\n\nIn the root locus method, it is important whether zeros and poles are in the left or right half planes, i.e. have real part greater than or less than zero. If a linear, time-invariant (LTI) system has poles that are\n*in the right half plane, it will be [[unstable]],\n*all in the left half plane, it will be [[BIBO stability|stable]],\n*on the imaginary axis, it will have [[marginal stability]].\nIf a system has zeros in the right half plane, it is a [[nonminimum phase]] system.\n\n===Improper integrals===\nIn applied fields, complex numbers are often used to compute certain real-valued [[improper integral]]s, by means of complex-valued functions. Several methods exist to do this; see [[methods of contour integration]].\n\n===Fluid dynamics===\nIn [[fluid dynamics]], complex functions are used to describe [[potential flow in two dimensions]].\n\n===Dynamic equations===\nIn [[differential equation]]s, it is common to first find all complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the [[Linear differential equation#Homogeneous equations with constant coefficients|characteristic equation]] of a [[linear differential equation]] or equation system and then attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''e''<sup>''rt''</sup>}}. Likewise, in [[difference equations]], the complex roots {{mvar|r}} of the characteristic equation of the difference equation system are used, to attempt to solve the system in terms of base functions of the form {{math|1=''f''(''t'') = ''r''<sup>''t''</sup>}}.\n\n===Electromagnetism and electrical engineering===\n{{Main|Alternating current}}\n\nIn [[electrical engineering]], the [[Fourier transform]] is used to analyze varying [[voltage]]s and [[Electric current|currents]]. The treatment of [[resistor]]s, [[capacitor]]s, and [[inductor]]s can then be unified by introducing imaginary, frequency-dependent resistances for the latter two and combining all three in a single complex number called the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. This approach is called [[phasor]] calculus.\n\nIn electrical engineering, the imaginary unit is denoted by {{math|''j''}}, to avoid confusion with {{mvar|I}}, which is generally in use to denote [[electric current]], or, more particularly, {{mvar|i}}, which is generally in use to denote instantaneous electric current.\n\nSince the [[voltage]] in an AC [[electric circuit|circuit]] is oscillating, it can be represented as\n\n:<math> V(t) = V_0 e^{j \\omega t} = V_0 \\left (\\cos \\omega t + j \\sin\\omega t \\right ),</math>\n\nTo obtain the measurable quantity, the real part is taken:\n\n:<math> v(t) = \\mathrm{Re}(V) = \\mathrm{Re}\\left [ V_0 e^{j \\omega t} \\right ] = V_0 \\cos \\omega t.</math>\n\nThe complex-valued signal <math>V(t)</math> is called the [[analytic signal|analytic]] representation of the real-valued, measurable signal <math>v(t)</math>.\n<ref>Electromagnetism (2nd edition), I.S. Grant, W.R. Phillips, Manchester Physics Series, 2008 {{isbn|0-471-92712-0}}</ref>\n\n===Signal analysis===\nComplex numbers are used in [[signal analysis]] and other fields for a convenient description for periodically varying signals. For given real functions representing actual physical quantities, often in terms of sines and cosines, corresponding complex functions are considered of which the real parts are the original quantities. For a [[sine wave]] of a given [[frequency]], the absolute value {{math|{{!}}\u2009''z''\u2009{{!}}}} of the corresponding {{mvar|z}} is the [[amplitude]] and the [[Argument (complex analysis)|argument]] {{math|arg(''z'')}} is the [[phase (waves)|phase]].\n\nIf [[Fourier analysis]] is employed to write a given real-valued signal as a sum of periodic functions, these periodic functions are often written as complex valued functions of the form\n:<math>x(t) = \\operatorname{Re} \\{X( t ) \\} </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>X( t ) = A e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{ i \\phi } e^{i\\omega t} = a e^{i (\\omega t + \\phi) } </math>\n\nwhere \u03c9 represents the [[angular frequency]] and the complex number ''A'' encodes the phase and amplitude as explained above.\n\nThis use is also extended into [[digital signal processing]] and [[digital image processing]], which utilize digital versions of Fourier analysis (and [[wavelet]] analysis) to transmit, [[Data compression|compress]], restore, and otherwise process [[Digital data|digital]] [[Sound|audio]] signals, still images, and [[video]] signals.\n\nAnother example, relevant to the two side bands of [[amplitude modulation]] of AM radio, is:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos((\\omega+\\alpha)t)+\\cos\\left((\\omega-\\alpha)t\\right) & = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i(\\omega+\\alpha)t} + e^{i(\\omega-\\alpha)t}\\right) \\\\\n& = \\operatorname{Re}\\left((e^{i\\alpha t} + e^{-i\\alpha t})\\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n& = \\operatorname{Re}\\left(2\\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n& = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t) \\cdot \\operatorname{Re}\\left(e^{i\\omega t}\\right) \\\\\n& = 2 \\cos(\\alpha t)\\cdot \\cos\\left(\\omega t\\right).\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n===Quantum mechanics===\nThe complex number field is intrinsic to the [[mathematical formulations of quantum mechanics]], where complex [[Hilbert space]]s provide the context for one such formulation that is convenient and perhaps most standard. The original foundation formulas of quantum mechanics&mdash;the [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] and Heisenberg's [[matrix mechanics]]&mdash;make use of complex numbers.\n\n===Relativity===\nIn [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], some formulas for the metric on [[spacetime]] become simpler if one takes the time component of the spacetime continuum to be imaginary. (This approach is no longer standard in classical relativity, but is [[Wick rotation|used in an essential way]] in [[quantum field theory]].) Complex numbers are essential to [[spinor]]s, which are a generalization of the [[tensor]]s used in relativity.\n\n===Geometry===\n\n====Shapes====\nThree [[collinearity|non-collinear]] points <math>u, v, w</math> in the plane determine the '''shape''' of the triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math>. Locating the points in the complex plane, this shape of a triangle may be expressed by complex arithmetic as\n: <math>S(u, v, w) = \\frac {u - w}{u - v}. </math>\nThe shape <math>S</math> of a triangle will remain the same, when the complex plane is transformed by translation or dilation (by an [[affine transformation]]), corresponding to the intuitive notion of shape, and describing [[similarity (geometry)|similarity]]. Thus each triangle <math>\\{u, v, w\\}</math> is in a [[shape#Similarity classes|similarity class]] of triangles with the same shape.<ref>J.A. Lester (1996) \"Triangles I: Shapes\", ''[[Aequationes Mathematicae]]'' 52:30&ndash;54</ref>\n\n====Fractals====\nThe [[Mandelbrot set]] is an example of a fractal formed on the complex plane by plotting every location <math>c</math> where iterating the sequence <math>f_c(z)=z^2+c</math> does not [[diverge (stability theory)|diverge]] when [[Iteration|iterated]] infinitely. Similarly, [[Julia set]]s have the same rules, except where <math>c</math> remains constant.\n\n====Triangles====\nEvery triangle has a unique [[Steiner inellipse]]\u2014an [[ellipse]] inside the triangle and tangent to the midpoints of the three sides of the triangle. The [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of a triangle's Steiner inellipse can be found as follows, according to [[Marden's theorem]]:<ref>{{Citation |last1=Kalman |first1=Dan |title=An Elementary Proof of Marden's Theorem |year=2008a |journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly|The American Mathematical Monthly]] |issn=0002-9890 |volume=115 |pages=330\u201338 |url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/22/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=3338&pf=1}}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last1=Kalman |first1=Dan |title=The Most Marvelous Theorem in Mathematics |url=http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/?pa=content&sa=viewDocument&nodeId=1663 |year=2008b |journal=[http://mathdl.maa.org/mathDL/4/ Journal of Online Mathematics and its Applications]}}</ref> Denote the triangle's vertices in the complex plane as {{math|1=''a'' = ''x''<sub>''A''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''A''</sub>''i''}}, {{math|1=''b'' = ''x''<sub>''B''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''B''</sub>''i''}}, and {{math|1=''c'' = ''x''<sub>''C''</sub> + ''y''<sub>''C''</sub>''i''}}. Write the [[cubic equation]] <math>\\scriptstyle (x-a)(x-b)(x-c)=0</math>, take its derivative, and equate the (quadratic) derivative to zero. [[Marden's Theorem]] says that the solutions of this equation are the complex numbers denoting the locations of the two foci of the Steiner inellipse.\n\n===Algebraic number theory===\n[[File:Pentagon construct.gif|right|thumb|Construction of a regular pentagon [[compass and straightedge constructions|using straightedge and compass]].]]\nAs mentioned above, any nonconstant polynomial equation (in complex coefficients) has a solution in '''C'''. A fortiori, the same is true if the equation has rational coefficients. The roots of such equations are called [[algebraic number]]s &ndash; they are a principal object of study in [[algebraic number theory]]. Compared to {{overline|'''Q'''}}, the algebraic closure of '''Q''', which also contains all algebraic numbers, '''C''' has the advantage of being easily understandable in geometric terms. In this way, algebraic methods can be used to study geometric questions and vice versa. With algebraic methods, more specifically applying the machinery of [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] to the [[number field]] containing [[root of unity|roots of unity]], it can be shown that it is not possible to construct a regular [[nonagon]] [[compass and straightedge constructions|using only compass and straightedge]] &ndash; a purely geometric problem.\n\nAnother example are [[Gaussian integer]]s, that is, numbers of the form {{math|''x'' + ''iy''}}, where {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} are integers, which can be used to classify [[Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares|sums of squares]].\n\n===Analytic number theory===\n{{main|Analytic number theory}}\nAnalytic number theory studies numbers, often integers or rationals, by taking advantage of the fact that they can be regarded as complex numbers, in which analytic methods can be used. This is done by encoding number-theoretic information in complex-valued functions. For example, the [[Riemann zeta function]] {{math|\u03b6(''s'')}} is related to the distribution of [[prime number]]s.\n\n==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[History of complex numbers]] -->\nThe earliest fleeting reference to [[square root]]s of [[negative number]]s can perhaps be said to occur in the work of the [[Hellenistic mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Hero of Alexandria]] in the 1st century [[AD]], where in his ''[[Hero of Alexandria#Bibliography|Stereometrica]]'' he considers, apparently in error, the volume of an impossible [[frustum]] of a [[pyramid]] to arrive at the term <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{81 - 144} = 3i\\sqrt{7}</math> in his calculations, although negative quantities were not conceived of in [[Hellenistic mathematics]] and Heron merely replaced it by its positive (<math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{144 - 81} = 3\\sqrt{7}</math>).<ref>{{Citation |title=An Imaginary Tale: The Story of {{sqrt|\u22121}} |last=Nahin |first=Paul J. |year=2007 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |isbn= 978-0-691-12798-9 |url=http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=149&threadID=383188&messageID=1181284 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe impetus to study complex numbers as a topic in itself first arose in the 16th century when [[algebraic solution]]s for the roots of [[Cubic equation|cubic]] and [[Quartic equation|quartic]] [[polynomial]]s were discovered by Italian mathematicians (see [[Niccol\u00f2 Fontana Tartaglia]], [[Gerolamo Cardano]]). It was soon realized that these formulas, even if one was only interested in real solutions, sometimes required the manipulation of square roots of negative numbers. As an example, Tartaglia's formula for a cubic equation of the form <math>\\scriptstyle x^3 = px + q</math><ref>In modern notation, Tartaglia's solution is based on expanding the cube of the sum of two cube roots: <math>\\scriptstyle \\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right)^3 = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv} \\left(\\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}\\right) + u + v</math> With <math>\\scriptstyle x = \\sqrt[3]{u} + \\sqrt[3]{v}</math>, <math>\\scriptstyle p = 3 \\sqrt[3]{uv}</math>, <math>\\scriptstyle q = u + v</math>, {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} can be expressed in terms of {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} as <math>\\scriptstyle u = q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle v = q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}</math>, respectively. Therefore, <math>\\scriptstyle x = \\sqrt[3]{q/2 + \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}} + \\sqrt[3]{q/2 - \\sqrt{(q/2)^2-(p/3)^3}}</math>. When <math>\\scriptstyle (q/2)^2-(p/3)^3</math> is negative (casus irreducibilis), the second cube root should be regarded as the complex conjugate of the first one.</ref> gives the solution to the equation {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> = ''x''}} as\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\left((\\sqrt{-1})^{1/3}+\\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{-1})^{1/3}}\\right).</math>\n\nAt first glance this looks like nonsense. However formal calculations with complex numbers show that the equation {{math|1=''z''<sup>3</sup> = ''i''}} has solutions {{math|\u2212''i''}}, <math>{\\scriptstyle\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\scriptstyle\\frac{1}{2}}i</math> and <math>{\\scriptstyle\\frac{-\\sqrt{3}}{2}}+{\\scriptstyle\\frac{1}{2}}i</math>. Substituting these in turn for <math>{\\scriptstyle\\sqrt{-1}^{1/3}}</math> in Tartaglia's cubic formula and simplifying, one gets 0, 1 and &minus;1 as the solutions of {{math|1=''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' = 0}}. Of course this particular equation can be solved at sight but it does illustrate that when general formulas are used to solve cubic equations with real roots then, as later mathematicians showed rigorously, the use of complex numbers [[casus irreducibilis|is unavoidable]]. [[Rafael Bombelli]] was the first to explicitly address these seemingly paradoxical solutions of cubic equations and developed the rules for complex arithmetic trying to resolve these issues.\n\nThe term \"imaginary\" for these quantities was coined by [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] in 1637, although he was at pains to stress their imaginary nature<ref>{{Citation |title=La G\u00e9om\u00e9trie &#124; The Geometry of Ren\u00e9 Descartes with a facsimile of the first edition |last=Descartes |first=Ren\u00e9 |authorlink=Ren\u00e9 Descartes |year=1954 |origyear=1637 |publisher=[[Dover Publications]] |isbn=0-486-60068-8 |page= |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26400 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}</ref>\n{{quote|[...] sometimes only imaginary, that is one can imagine as many as I said in each equation, but sometimes there exists no quantity that matches that which we imagine.\n''([...] quelquefois seulement imaginaires c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que l\u2019on peut toujours en imaginer autant que j'ai dit en chaque \u00e9quation, mais qu\u2019il n\u2019y a quelquefois aucune quantit\u00e9 qui corresponde \u00e0 celle qu\u2019on imagine.)''}}\nA further source of confusion was that the equation <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{-1}^2=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{-1}=-1</math> seemed to be capriciously inconsistent with the algebraic identity <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{a}\\sqrt{b}=\\sqrt{ab}</math>, which is valid for non-negative real numbers {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}}, and which was also used in complex number calculations with one of {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} positive and the other negative. The incorrect use of this identity (and the related identity <math>\\scriptstyle \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{a}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{a}}</math>) in the case when both {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are negative even bedeviled Euler. This difficulty eventually led to the convention of using the special symbol {{math|''i''}} in place of {{sqrt|\u22121}} to guard against this mistake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Even so, Euler considered it natural to introduce students to complex numbers much earlier than we do today. In his elementary algebra text book, [[Elements of Algebra]], he introduces these numbers almost at once and then uses them in a natural way throughout.\n\nIn the 18th century complex numbers gained wider use, as it was noticed that formal manipulation of complex expressions could be used to simplify calculations involving trigonometric functions. For instance, in 1730 [[Abraham de Moivre]] noted that the complicated identities relating trigonometric functions of an integer multiple of an angle to powers of trigonometric functions of that angle could be simply re-expressed by the following well-known formula which bears his name, [[de Moivre's formula]]:\n\n:<math>(\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta)^{n} = \\cos n \\theta + i\\sin n \\theta. </math>\n\nIn 1748 [[Leonhard Euler]] went further and obtained [[Euler's formula]] of [[complex analysis]]:\n\n:<math>\\cos \\theta + i\\sin \\theta = e ^{i\\theta } </math>\n\nby formally manipulating complex [[power series]] and observed that this formula could be used to reduce any trigonometric identity to much simpler exponential identities.\n\nThe idea of a complex number as a point in the complex plane ([[#Complex plane|above]]) was first described by [[Caspar Wessel]] in 1799, although it had been anticipated as early as 1685 in [[John Wallis|Wallis's]] ''De Algebra tractatus''.\n\nWessel's memoir appeared in the Proceedings of the [[Copenhagen Academy]] but went largely unnoticed. In 1806 [[Jean-Robert Argand]] independently issued a pamphlet on complex numbers and provided a rigorous proof of the [[Fundamental theorem of algebra#History|fundamental theorem of algebra]]. [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] had earlier published an essentially [[topology|topological]] proof of the theorem in 1797 but expressed his doubts at the time about \"the true metaphysics of the square root of \u22121\". It was not until 1831 that he overcame these doubts and published his treatise on complex numbers as points in the plane, largely establishing modern notation and terminology. In the beginning of the 19th century, other mathematicians discovered independently the geometrical representation of the complex numbers: Bu\u00e9e, [[C. V. Mourey|Mourey]], [[John Warren (mathematician)|Warren]], [[Jacques Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Fran\u00e7ais|Fran\u00e7ais]] and his brother, [[Giusto Bellavitis|Bellavitis]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Two Cultures |editor= Kim Williams (ed.) |last1=Caparrini |first1=Sandro |chapter=On the Common Origin of Some of the Works on the Geometrical Interpretation of Complex Numbers|year=2000 |publisher=Birkh\u00e4user |isbn= 3-7643-7186-2 |page=139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voFsJ1EhCnYC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=voFsJ1EhCnYC&pg=PA139 Extract of page 139]</ref>\n\nThe English mathematician [[G.

Argand called <math>\\scriptstyle \\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''direction factor'', and <math>\\scriptstyle r = \\sqrt{a^2+b^2}</math> the ''modulus''; Cauchy (1828) called <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math> the ''reduced form'' (l'expression r\u00e9duite) and apparently introduced the term ''argument''; Gauss used {{math|''i''}} for <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{-1}</math>, introduced the term ''complex number'' for {{math|''a'' + ''bi''}}, and called {{math|''a''<sup>2</sup> + ''b''<sup>2</sup>}} the ''norm''. The expression ''direction coefficient'', often used for <math>\\cos \\phi + i\\sin \\phi</math>, is due to Hankel (1867), and ''absolute value,'' for ''modulus,'' is due to Weierstrass.\n\nLater classical writers on the general theory include [[Richard Dedekind]], [[Otto H\u00f6lder]], [[Felix Klein]], [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]], [[Hermann Schwarz]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and many others.\n\n==Generalizations and related notions==\nThe process of extending the field '''R''' of reals to '''C''' is known as the [[Cayley\u2013Dickson construction]]. It can be carried further to higher dimensions, yielding the [[quaternion]]s '''H''' and [[octonion]]s '''O''' which (as a real vector space) are of dimension&nbsp;4 and 8, respectively.\nIn this context the complex numbers have been called the '''binarions'''.<ref>Kevin McCrimmon (2004) ''A Taste of Jordan Algebras'', pp 64, Universitext, Springer {{isbn|0-387-95447-3}} {{mr|id=2014924}}</ref>\n\nJust as by applying the construction to reals the property of [[ordered field|ordering]] is lost, properties familiar from real and complex numbers vanish with each extension. The [[quaternion]]s lose commutativity, i.e.: {{math|''x''\u00b7''y'' \u2260 ''y''\u00b7''x''}} for some quaternions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',}} and the multiplication of [[octonion]]s, additionally to not being commutative, fails to be associative: {{math|(''x''\u00b7''y'')\u00b7''z'' \u2260 ''x''\u00b7(''y''\u00b7''z'')}} for some octonions {{math|''x'',\u2009''y'',\u2009''z''.}}\n\nReals, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions are all [[normed division algebra]]s over '''R'''. By [[Hurwitz's theorem (normed division algebras)|Hurwitz's theorem]] they are the only ones; the [[sedenion]]s, the next step in the Cayley\u2013Dickson construction, fail to have this structure.\n\nThe Cayley\u2013Dickson construction is closely related to the [[regular representation]] of '''C''', thought of as an '''R'''-[[Algebra (ring theory)|algebra]] (an '''R'''-vector space with a multiplication), with respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}. This means the following: the '''R'''-linear map\n:<math>\\mathbb{C} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}, z \\mapsto wz</math>\nfor some fixed complex number {{mvar|w}} can be represented by a {{math|2\u2009\u00d7\u20092}} matrix (once a basis has been chosen). With respect to the basis {{math|(1,\u2009''i'')}}, this matrix is\n:<math>\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\operatorname{Re}(w) & -\\operatorname{Im}(w) \\\\\n  \\operatorname{Im}(w) & \\;\\; \\operatorname{Re}(w)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\ni.e., the one mentioned in the section on matrix representation of complex numbers above. While this is a [[linear representation]] of '''C''' in the [[2 \u00d7 2 real matrices]], it is not the only one. Any matrix\n:<math>J = \\begin{pmatrix}p & q \\\\ r & -p \\end{pmatrix}, \\quad p^2 + qr + 1 = 0</math>\nhas the property that its square is the negative of the identity matrix: {{math|1=''J''<sup>2</sup> = \u2212''I''}}. Then\n:<math>\\{ z = a I + b J : a,b \\in \\mathbf{R} \\}</math>\nis also isomorphic to the field '''C''', and gives an alternative complex structure on '''R'''<sup>2</sup>. This is generalized by the notion of a [[linear complex structure]].\n\n[[Hypercomplex number]]s also generalize '''R''', '''C''', '''H''', and '''O'''. For example, this notion contains the [[split-complex number]]s, which are elements of the ring {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> &minus; 1)}} (as opposed to {{math|'''R'''[''x'']/(''x''<sup>2</sup> + 1)}}). In this ring, the equation {{math|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> = 1}} has four solutions.\n\nThe field '''R''' is the completion of '''Q''', the field of [[rational number]]s, with respect to the usual [[absolute value]] [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]. Other choices of [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]s on '''Q''' lead to the fields '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]] (for any [[prime number]] ''p''), which are thereby analogous to '''R'''. There are no other nontrivial ways of completing '''Q''' than '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, by [[Ostrowski's theorem]]. The algebraic closures <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> still carry a norm, but (unlike '''C''') are not complete with respect to it. The completion <math>\\mathbf{C}_p</math> of <math>\\overline {\\mathbf{Q}_p}</math> turns out to be algebraically closed. This field is called ''p''-adic complex numbers by analogy.\n\nThe fields '''R''' and '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> and their finite field extensions, including '''C''', are [[local field]]s.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Complex numbers}}\n* [[Algebraic surface]]\n* [[Circular motion#Using complex numbers|Circular motion using complex numbers]]\n* [[Complex-base system]]\n* [[Complex geometry]]\n* [[Complex square root]]\n* [[Eisenstein integer]]\n* [[Euler's identity]]\n* [[Gaussian integer]]\n* [[Riemann sphere]] (extended complex plane)\n* [[Root of unity]]\n* [[Unit complex number]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Mathematical references===\n* {{Citation |last=Ahlfors |first=Lars |authorlink=Lars Ahlfors |title=Complex analysis |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1979 |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-07-000657-7}}\n* {{Citation |last=Conway |first=John B. |title=Functions of One Complex Variable I |year=1986 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-90328-3}}\n* {{Citation |last1=Joshi |first1=Kapil D. |title=Foundations of Discrete Mathematics |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |location=New York |isbn=978-0-470-21152-6 |year=1989}}\n* {{Citation |last=Pedoe |first=Dan |authorlink=Dan Pedoe |title=Geometry: A comprehensive course |publisher=Dover |year=1988 |isbn=0-486-65812-0}}\n* {{Citation |last1=Press |first1=WH |last2=Teukolsky |first2=SA |last3=Vetterling |first3=WT |last4=Flannery |first4=BP |year=2007 |title=Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing |edition=3rd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |publication-place=New York |isbn=978-0-521-88068-8 |chapter=Section 5.5 Complex Arithmetic |chapter-url=http://apps.nrbook.com/empanel/index.html?pg=225}}\n* {{springer|id=c/c024140|title=Complex number|year=2001|first=E.D.|last=Solomentsev}}\n\n===Historical references===\n* {{Citation |last1=Burton |first1=David M. |title=The History of Mathematics |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |location=New York |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-07-009465-9 |year=1995}}\n* {{Citation |last1=Katz |first1=Victor J. |title=A History of Mathematics, Brief Version |publisher=[[Addison-Wesley]] |isbn=978-0-321-16193-2 |year=2004}}\n* {{Citation |title=An Imaginary Tale: The Story of <math>\\scriptstyle\\sqrt{-1}</math> |first=Paul J. |last=Nahin |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02795-1 |year=1998}}\n*: A gentle introduction to the history of complex numbers and the beginnings of complex analysis.\n* {{Citation |author1=H.

Cryptozoologists refer to these entities as ''cryptids'', a term coined by the subculture. Because it does not follow the [[scientific method]], cryptozoology is considered a pseudoscience by the academic world: it is neither a branch of [[zoology]] nor [[folkloristics]].\n\nOriginally founded in the 1950s by zoologists [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], scholars have noted that the pseudoscience rejected mainstream approaches from an early date, and that adherents often express hostility to mainstream science. Scholars have studied cryptozoologists and their influence (including the pseudoscience's association with [[Young Earth creationism]]), and have noted parallels in cryptozoology and other pseudosciences such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]].\n\n==Terminology, history, and approach==\nAs a field, cryptozoology originates from  the works of colleagues Bernard Heuvelmans, a [[Belgian]] zoologist, and Ivan T. Sanderson, a Scottish zoologist. Notably, Heuvelmans published ''[[On the Track of Unknown Animals]]'' (French ''Sur la Piste des B\u00eates Ignor\u00e9es'') in 1955, a landmark work among cryptozoologists that was followed by numerous other like works. Similarly, Sanderson published a series of books that assisted in developing hallmarks of cryptozoology, including ''Abominable Snowmen: Legend Come to Life'' (1961).<ref name=\"REGAL-326-329\">Regal, Brian (2011) \"Cryptozoology\", pp. 326-329 as published in McCormick, Charlie T. and Kim Kennedy (2011).

Oxford University Press, September 2016. Web. 25 October 2016.</ref> Patterned after ''cryptozoology'', the term ''cryptid'' was coined in 1983 by cryptozoologist J. E.

(2011). \"Putting the \u201cology\u201d into cryptozoology.\" . ''Biofortean Notes''. Vol. 7, pp. 7-20, 310.</ref>\n\nWhile biologists regularly identify new species, cryptozoologists often focus on creatures from the [[folklore]] record. Most famously, these include the [[Loch Ness Monster]], [[Bigfoot]], the [[chupacabra]], as well as other \"imposing beasts that could be labeled as monsters\". In their hunt for these entities, cryptozoologists may employ devices such as motion-sensitive cameras, night-vision equipment, and audio-recording equipment. While there have been attempts to codify cryptozoological approaches, unlike biologists, zoologists, botanists, and other academic disciplines, however, \"there are no accepted, uniform, or successful methods for pursuing cryptids\".<ref name=\"REGAL-326-329\"/> Some scholars have identified precursors to modern cryptozoology in certain medieval approaches to the folklore record, and the psychology behind the cryptozoology approach has been the subject of academic study.<ref name=\"REGAL-326-329\"/>\n\nFew cryptozoologists have a formal science education, and fewer still have a science background directly relevant to cryptozoology. Adherents often misrepresent the academic backgrounds of cryptozoologists. According to writer [[Daniel Loxton]] and paleontologist [[Donald Prothero]], \"Cryptozoologists have often promoted 'Professor [[Roy Mackal]], PhD.' as one of their leading figures and one of the few with a legitimate doctorate in biology. What is rarely mentioned, however, is that he had no training that would qualify him to undertake competent research on exotic animals. This raises the specter of 'credential mongering', by which an individual or organization feints a person's graduate degree as proof of expertise, even though his or her training is not specifically relevant to the field under consideration.\" Besides Heuvalmans, Sanderson, and Mackal, notable cryptozoologists with academic backgrounds include [[Grover Krantz]], [[Karl Shuker]], and [[Richard Greenwell]].<ref name=\"LOXTON-PROTHERO-2013-304-305\">Loxton, Daniel and Donald Prothero. 2013.

Card summarizes cryptozoology in a survey of pseudoscience and [[pseudoarchaeology]]:\n\n:Cryptozoology purports to be the study of previously unidentified animal species. At first glance, this would seem to differ little from zoology. New species are discovered by field and museum zoologists every year. Cryptozoologists cite these discoveries as justification of their search but often minimize or omit the fact that the discoverers do not identify as cryptozoologists and are academically trained zoologists working in an ecological paradigm rather than organizing expeditions to seek out supposed examples of unusual and large creatures.<ref name=\"CARD-23-32\">Card, Jeb J. 2016. \"Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience\" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S.

[[University of Alabama Press]]. {{ISBN|9780817319113}}</ref>\n\nCard notes that \"cryptozoologists often show their disdain and even hatred for professional scientists, including those who enthusiastically participated in cryptozoology\", which he traces back to Heuvelmans's early \"rage against critics of cryptozoology\". He finds parallels with cryptozoology and other pseudosciences, such as [[ghost hunting]] and [[ufology]], and compares the approach of cryptozoologists to colonial big-game hunters, and to aspects of European imperialism. According to Card, \"Most cryptids are framed as the subject of indigenous legends typically collected in the hayday of [[comparative folklore]], though such legends may be heavily modified or worse. Cryptozoology's complicated mix of sympathy, interest, and appropriation of indigenous culture (or non-indigenous construction of it) is also found in [[New Age]] circles and dubious \"[[Indian burial grounds]]\" and other [[legend]]s ... invoked in [[haunting]]s such as the [[The Amityville Horror|\"Amityville\" hoax]] ...\".<ref name=\"CARD-24-25\">Card, Jeb J. 2016. \"Steampunk Inquiry: A Comparative Vivisection of Discovery Pseudoscience\" in Card, Jeb J. and Anderson, David S.

Beliefs in the existence of fabulous and supernatural animals are ubiquitous and timeless. In the continents discovered by Europe indigenous beliefs and tales have strongly influenced the perceptions of the conquered confronted by a new natural environment. In parallel with the growing importance of the scientific approach, these traditional mythical tales have been endowed with sometimes highly artificial precision and have given birth to contemporary legends solidly entrenched in their territories. The belief self-perpetuates today through multiple observations enhanced by the media and encouraged (largely with the aim of gain for touristic promotion) by the local population, often genuinely convinced of the reality of this profitable phenomenon.\"<ref name=\"CAMPION-VINCENT-173\">Campion-Vincent, V\u00e9ronique. 1992. \u201cAppearances of Beasts and Mystery-cats in France\u201d.

Regarding cryptozoologists, Campion-Vincent says that \"this movement seems to deserve the appellation of parascience, like [[parapsychology]]: the same corpus is reviewed; many scientists participate, but for those who have an official status of university professor or researcher, the participation is a private hobby\".<ref name=\"CAMPION-VINCENT-173\"/>\n\nIn her ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', academic [[Linda Watts]] says that \"folklore concerning unreal animals or beings, sometimes called monsters, is a popular field of inquiry\" and describes cryptozoology as an example of \"American narrative traditions\" that \"feature many monsters\".<ref name=\"WATTS-271\">Watts, Linda S. 2007. ''Encyclopedia of American Folklore'', p. 271. [[Facts on File]].</ref>\n\nIn his analysis of cryptozoology, folklorist [[Peter Dendle]] says that \"cryptozoology devotees consciously position themselves in defiance of mainstream science\" and that:\n<blockquote>\n:The psychological significance of cryptozoology in the modern world .. serves to channel guilt over the decimation of species and destruction of the natural habitat; to recapture a sense of mysticism and danger in a world now perceived as fully charted and over-explored; and to articulate resentment of and defiance against a scientific community perceived as monopolising the pool of culturally acceptable beliefs.<ref name=\"DENDLE-2006-190-206\">Dendle, Peter. 2006. \"Cryptozoology in the Medieval and Modern Worlds\".

Only those characteristics can explain the belief of some humans in creationism, in the arrival of UFO's with extraterrestrial beings, or in some aspects of cryptozoology. \u2026 In several respects the discussion and practice of cryptozoology sometimes, although not invariably, has demonstrated both deception and gullibility. An example seems to merit the old Latin saying 'I believe because it is incredible,' although Tertullian, its author, applied it in a way more applicable to the present day creationists.<ref name=\"SIMPSON-1984-1-16\">Simpson, George Gaylord (1984). \"Mammals and Cryptozoology\".

She concludes that many cryptozoologists are \"passionate and sincere in their belief that mystery animals exist. As such, they give deference to every report of a sighting, often without criticial questioning.

Once cliffs erode, midden-remains become exposed as blackened areas containing charred stones, bones, and shells. They are usually found a metre below the surface. Mesolithic people did not have major rituals associated with burial, unlike those of the Neolithic (New Stone Age) period.<ref name=\"The Neolithic, or New Stone Age\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/pre_norman_history/neolithic_age.html |title=Travel with us through the history of Ireland! |accessdate=2013-04-26 }}</ref>\nThe Neolithic period followed the Mesolithic around 6,000 years ago. People began to farm the land, domesticate animals for food and milk, and settle in one place for longer periods. The people had skills such as making pottery, building houses from wood, weaving, and knapping (stone tool working). The first farmers cleared forestry to graze livestock and grow crops. In North Mayo, where the ground cover was fragile, thin soils washed away and [[blanket bog]] covered the land farmed by the Neolithic people.\n\nExtensive pre-bog field systems have been discovered under the blanket bog, particularly along the North Mayo coastline in [[Erris]] and north [[Tyrawley]] at sites such as the [[C\u00e9ide Fields]], centred on the north east coast.\n\nThe Neolithic people developed rituals associated with burying their dead; this is why they built huge, elaborate, galleried stone tombs for their dead leaders, known nowadays as megalithic tombs. There are over 160 recorded megaliths in County Mayo, such as [[Faulagh]].\n\n[[File:Greystone011-6may08 004.JPG|thumb|Megalithic tomb at [[Faulagh]], [[Erris]]]]\n\n===Megalithic tombs===\nThere are four distinct types of [[Irish megalithic tombs]]\u2014[[court cairn|court tomb]]s, [[Dolmen|portal tomb]]s, [[passage grave|passage tomb]]s and [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]]s\u2014examples of all of which can be found in County Mayo.<ref>http://www.environ.ie/en/Publications/Heritage</ref> Areas particularly rich in megalithic tombs include [[Achill Island|Achill]], [[Kilcommon]], [[Ballyhaunis]], [[Moygownagh]], [[Killala]] and the Behy/Glenurla area around the [[C\u00e9ide Fields]].\n\n===Bronze Age (ca. 2,500 BC to 500 BC)===\nMegalithic tomb building continued into the [[Bronze Age]] when metal began to be worked for tools alongside the stone tools. The Bronze Age lasted approximately from 4,500 years ago to 2,500 years ago (2,500 BC to 500 BC). Archaeological remains from this period include [[stone row|stone alignments]], [[stone circle]]s and [[Fulacht fiadh|fulachta fiadh]] (early cooking sites). They continued to bury their chieftains in megalithic tombs which changed design during this period, more being of the [[wedge-shaped gallery grave|wedge tomb]] type and [[cist]] burials.\n\n===Iron Age (ca. 500 BC to AD 325)===\nAround 2,500 years ago the [[Iron Age]] took over from the Bronze Age as more and more metalworking took place. This is thought to have coincided with the arrival of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] speaking peoples and the introduction of the ancestor of Irish. Towards the end of this period, the Roman Empire was at its height in Britain but it is not thought that the Roman Empire extended into Ireland to any large degree. Remains from this period, which lasted until the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian]] period began about AD 325 (with the arrival of St. Patrick into Ireland, as a slave) include [[crann\u00f3g]]s (Lake dwellings), [[promontory fort]]s, [[ringfort]]s and [[souterrain]]s of which there are numerous examples across the county.\nThe [[Iron Age]] was a time of tribal warfare with kingships, each fighting neighbouring kings, vying for control of territories and taking slaves. Territories were marked by tall stone markers, [[Ogham]] stones, using the first written down words using the [[Ogham inscription|Ogham alphabet]]. The Iron Age is the time period in which the tales of the [[Ulster Cycle]] and sagas took place. The [[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Flidhais]] which took place mainly in [[Erris]] sets the scene well.\n\n===Early Christian period (ca. AD 325 to AD 800)===\n[[File:Aghagower St Patrick Statue 2007 08 12.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Statue of St. Patrick Aghagower]]\nChristianity came to Ireland around the start of the 5th century. It brought many changes including the introduction of writing and recording events. The tribal 'tuatha' and the new religious settlements existed side by side. Sometimes it suited the chieftains to become part of the early Churches, other times they remained as separate entities. St. Patrick (4th century) may have spent time in County Mayo and it is believed that he spent forty days and forty nights on Croagh Patrick praying for the people of Ireland. From the middle of the 6th century hundreds of small monastic settlements were established around the county.<ref name=\"County Mayo: An Outline History\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mayo-ireland.ie/Mayo/History/FullHist.htm |title=County Mayo: An Outline History by Bernard O'Hara and Nollaig \u00d3'Mura\u00edle |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> Some examples of well-known early monastic sites in Mayo include [[Mayo Abbey]], [[Aughagower]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew Abbey]], [[Cong Abbey]], [[Killala]], Turlough on the outskirts of Castlebar, and island settlements off the [[Mullet Peninsula]] like the [[Inishkea Islands]], [[Inishglora]] and [[Duvillaun]].\n\nIn 795 the first of the [[Viking]] raids took place. The Vikings came from [[Scandinavia]] to raid the monasteries as they were places of wealth with precious metal working taking place in them. Some of the larger ecclesiastical settlements erected [[Irish round tower|round tower]]s to prevent their precious items being plundered and also to show their status and strength against these pagan raiders from the north. There are round towers at [[Aughagower]], [[Balla, County Mayo|Balla]], [[Killala]], Turlough and Meelick. The Vikings established settlements which later developed into towns (Dublin, Cork, Wexford, Waterford etc..) but none were in County Mayo. Between the reigns of [[Kings of Connacht]] [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] (973\u20131010) and [[Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair]] (1106\u20131156), various tribal territories were incorporated into the kingdom of Connacht and ruled by the Siol Muirdaig dynasty, based initially at [[Rathcroghan]] in [[County Roscommon]], and from c. 1050 at [[Tuam]]. The families of [[O'Malley (surname)|O'Malley]] and [[O'Dowd]] of Mayo served as [[admiral]]s of the [[Naval fleet|fleet]] of [[Connacht]], while families such as O'Lachtnan, [[Mac Fhirbhisigh]], and O'Cleary were ecclesiastical and bardic clans.\n\n===Anglo-Normans (12th to 16th centuries)===\nIn AD 1169 when one of the warring kings in the east of Ireland, [[Dermot MacMurrough]], appealed to the King of England for help in his fight with a neighbouring king, the response was the arrival of the Anglo-Norman colonisation of Ireland.\nCounty Mayo came under Norman control in AD 1235. Norman control meant the eclipse of many Gaelic lords and chieftains, chiefly the O'Connors of Connacht.<ref name=\"County Mayo: An Outline History\" /> During the 1230s, the [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]]s and [[Wales|Welsh]] under [[Richard M\u00f3r de Burgh]] (c. 1194 \u2013 1242) invaded and settled in the county, introducing new families such as [[Burke (surname)|Burke]], [[Gibbons]], [[Staunton (surname)|Staunton]], [[Prendergast (disambiguation)|Prendergast]], [[Morris (surname)|Morris]], [[Joyce (name)|Joyce]], [[Walsh (surname)|Walsh]], [[Barrett (surname)|Barrett]], [[Lynott (disambiguation)|Lynott]], [[Costello (surname)|Costello]], [[Padden]] and [[Price]], Norman names are still common in County Mayo. Following the collapse of the lordship in the 1330s, all these families became [[Family estrangement|estranged]] from the [[Anglo-Irish]] administration based in [[Dublin]] and assimilated with the Gaelic-Irish, adopting their language, religion, dress, laws, customs and culture and marrying into Irish families. They \"became more Irish than the Irish themselves\".\n\nThe most powerful clan to emerge during this era were the Mac William Burkes, also known as the Mac William Iochtar (see Burke Civil War 1333\u20131338), descended from Sir William Liath de Burgh, who defeated the Gaelic-Irish at the [[Second Battle of Athenry]] in August 1316. They were frequently at war with their cousins, [[Clanricarde]] of [[Galway]], and in alliance with or against various factions of the O'Conor's of Siol Muiredaig and [[Kelly (name)|O'Kelly]]'s of [[U\u00ed Maine]]. The [[O'Donnell dynasty|O'Donnell]]'s of [[Tyrconnell]] regularly invaded in an attempt to secure their right to rule.\n\nThe Anglo Normans encouraged and established many religious orders from continental Europe to settle in Ireland. Mendicant orders\u2014Augustinians, Carmelites, Dominicans and Franciscans began new settlements across Ireland and built large churches, many under the patronage of prominent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] families. Some of these sites include [[Cong, County Mayo|Cong]], [[Strade]], [[Ballintubber]], [[Errew Abbey]], [[Burrishoole Friary|Burrishoole Abbey]] and [[Mayo Abbey]].<ref name=\"Anglo-Norman\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/LI/Anglo_Norman.htm|title=Universit\u00e4t Duisburg-Essen: Language in Ireland |accessdate=2013-04-26}}</ref> During the 15th and 16th centuries, despite regular conflicts between them as England chopped and changed between religious beliefs, the Irish usually regarded the King of England as their King. When [[Elizabeth I]] came to the throne in the mid-16th century, the English people, as was customary at that time, followed the religious practices of the reigning monarch and became Protestant. Many Irish people such as [[Gr\u00e1\u00ednne O'Malley]], the famous pirate queen, had close relationships with the English monarchy, and the English kings and queens were welcome visitors to Irish shores. The Irish however, generally held onto their Catholic religious practices and beliefs. The early plantations of settlers in Ireland began during the reign of Queen Mary in the mid-16th century and continued throughout the long reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] until 1603. By then the term ''County Mayo'' had come into use. In the summer of 1588 the galleons of the [[Spanish Armada]] were wrecked by [[Brian Rua U'Cearbhain|storms along the west coast]] of Ireland. Some of the hapless Spaniards came ashore in Mayo, only to be robbed and imprisoned, and in many cases slaughtered. Almost all the religious foundations set up by the Anglo Normans were suppressed in the wake of the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century.<ref>http://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/past/history/15411598.html</ref>\n\n[[Protestantism|Protestant]] settlers from [[Scotland]], [[England]], and elsewhere in Ireland, settled in the County in the early 17th century. Many would be killed or forced to flee because of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641|1641 Rebellion]], during which a number of massacres were committed by the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Irish, most notably at [[Shrule]] in 1642. A third of the overall population was reported to have perished due to warfare, famine and plague between 1641 and 1653, with several areas remaining disturbed and frequented by [[Whiteboys|Reparees]] into the 1670s.\n\n===17th and 18th centuries===\n[[File:Grace O'Malley00.jpg|left|thumb|[[Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley]] meeting Queen Elizabeth I]]\nPirate Queen Gr\u00e1inne O'Malley is probably the best known person from County Mayo between the mid-16th century and the turn of the 17th century.<ref>http://www.graceomalley.com/timeline.php</ref> In the 1640s, when Oliver Cromwell overthrew the English monarchy and set up a parliamentarian government, Ireland suffered severely. With a stern regime in absolute control needing to pay its armies and friends, the need to pay them with grants of land in Ireland led to the '[[to hell or to Connaught]]' policies.<ref>http://www.libraryireland.com/IrishIndependence/22.php</ref> Displaced native Irish families from other (eastern and southern mostly) parts of the country were either forced to leave the country, often as slaves, or (if they had been well behaved and compliant with the orders of the parliamentarians) awarded grants of land 'west of the Shannon' and put off their own lands in the east. The land in the west was divided and sub-divided between more and more people as huge estates were granted on the best land in the east to those who best pleased the English.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-society.org/Hedgemaster%20Archives/Cromwell_2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011165306/http://www.irish-society.org/Hedgemaster%20Archives/Cromwell_2.htm |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy}}</ref> Mayo does not seem to have been affected much during the [[Williamite War in Ireland]], though many natives were outlawed and exiled.\n[[File:Nephin Mountain, County Mayo July 2010.jpg|thumb|Nephin Mountain, County Mayo]]\nFor the vast majority of people in County Mayo the 18th century was a period of unrelieved misery. Because of the penal laws, Catholics had no hope of social advancement while they remained in their native land. Some, like [[William Brown (admiral)|William Brown]] (1777\u20131857), left Foxford with his family at the age of nine and thirty years later was an admiral in the fledgling Argentine Navy. Today he is a national hero in that country.<ref>http://www.con-telegraph.ie/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=326:illustrious-and-amazing-career-of-admiral-william-brown&catid=52:mayo-history&Itemid=89</ref>\n\nThe general unrest in Ireland was felt just as keenly across Mayo, and as the 18th century approached and news reached Ireland about the [[American War of Independence]] and the [[French Revolution]], the downtrodden Irish, constantly suppressed by Government policies and decisions from Dublin and London, began to rally themselves for their own stand against English rule in their country. By 1798 the Irish were ready for rebellion. The French came to help the Irish cause. [[Jean Joseph Amable Humbert|General Humbert]], from France landed in [[Killala]] with over 1,000 officers where they started to march across the county towards [[Battle of Castlebar|Castlebar]] where there was an English garrison. Taking them by surprise Humbert's army was victorious. He established a 'Republic of Connacht' with one of the Moore family from [[Moore Hall, County Mayo|Moore Hall]] near Partry. Humbert's army marched on towards Sligo, Leitrim and Longford where they were suddenly faced with a massive English army and were forced to surrender in less than half an hour. The French soldiers were treated honourably, but for the Irish the surrender meant slaughter. Many died on the scaffold in towns like Castlebar and Claremorris, where the high sheriff for County Mayo, the Honourable Denis Browne, M.P., brother of Lord Altamont, wreaked a terrible vengeance \u2013 thus earning for himself the nickname which has survived in folk memory to the present day, 'Donnchadh an R\u00f3pa' (Denis of the Rope).\n\nIn the 18th century and early 19th century, sectarian tensions arose as evangelical Protestant missionaries sought to 'redeem the Irish poor from the errors of Popery'. One of the best known was the Rev. Edward Nangle's mission at Dugort in [[Achill Island|Achill]].<ref>http://www.mayococo.ie/en/Services/Environment/LeisureAmenities/Beaches/Doogort/</ref> These too were the years of the campaign for Catholic Emancipation and, later, for the abolition of the tithes, which a predominately Catholic population was forced to pay for the upkeep of the clergy of the Established (Protestant) Church.\n\n===19th and 20th centuries===\nDuring the early years of the 19th century, famine was a common occurrence, particularly where population pressure was a problem. The population of Ireland grew to over eight million people prior to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Famine]] (or Great Famine) of 1845&ndash;47. The Irish people depended on the potato crop for their sustenance. Disaster struck in August 1845, when a killer fungus (later diagnosed as Phytophthora infestans) started to destroy the potato crop. When widespread famine struck, about a million people died and a further million left the country. People died in the fields from starvation and disease. The catastrophe was particularly bad in County Mayo, where nearly ninety per cent of the population depended on the potato as their staple food. By 1848, Mayo was a county of total misery and despair, with any attempts at alleviating measures in complete disarray.<ref>http://www.libraryireland.com/articles/FamineBelmulletFriends/index.php</ref>\n\n[[File:Michael davitt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Michael Davitt]]]]\nThere are numerous reminders of the Great Famine to be seen on the Mayo landscape: workhouse sites, famine graves, sites of soup kitchens, deserted homes and villages and even traces of undug 'lazy-beds' in fields on the sides of hills. Many roads and lanes were built as famine relief measures. There were nine workhouses in the county: Ballina, Ballinrobe, Belmullet, Castlebar, Claremorris, Killala, Newport, Swinford and Westport.<ref>http://www.mayohistory.com/H18to19.htm</ref>\n\n[[File:Irishin1871.jpg|thumb|upright|The distribution of the [[Irish language]] in 1871. Mayo's relative remoteness meant that Irish was still widely spoken decades after the Great Famine and is still spoken today in the north-west of the county]]\n\nA small poverty-stricken place called [[Knock Shrine|Knock]], County Mayo, made headlines when it was announced that an apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. Joseph and St. John had taken place there on 21 August 1879, witnessed by fifteen local people.<ref>http://www.knock-shrine.ie/witnesses-accounts</ref>\n\nA national movement was initiated in County Mayo during 1879 by [[Michael Davitt]], [[James Daly (Irish Land League)|James Daly]], and others, which brought about the greatest social change ever witnessed in Ireland. Michael Davitt, a labourer whose family had moved to England joined forces with Charles Stewart Parnell to win back the land for the people from the landlords and stop evictions for non payment of rents.<ref>http://www.irishidentity.com/stories/parnelldav.htm</ref>\n\nA new word came into the English language through an incident that occurred in Mayo. An English landlord called Captain Charles Cunningham [[Boycott]] could get no workers to do anything for him, so unpleasant as he was to them, so he brought in Protestant workers from elsewhere. He spent so much on security and protection for them that his harvest cost him a fortune and also nobody in the area would serve him in shops, or deal with him. This ostracisation became known as \"boycotting\" and Captain Boycott was left with no option but to leave Mayo and take his family with him to England.<ref>http://www.askaboutireland.ie/learning-zone/primary-students/looking-at-places/mayo/michael-davitt/captain-boycott/</ref>\n\nThe \"Land Question\" was gradually resolved by a scheme of state-aided land purchase schemes.<ref>http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-IrishLan.html</ref> The tenants became the owners of their lands under the newly set-up [[Irish Land Commission|Land Commission]].\n\nA Mayo nun, Mother Agnes Morrogh-Bernard (1842\u20131932), set up the Foxford Woollen Mill in 1892. She made Foxford synonymous throughout the world with high quality tweeds, rugs and blankets.<ref>http://www.discoverireland.com/us/ireland-things-to-see-and-do/listings/product/?fid=FI_444</ref><ref>http://www.museumsofmayo.com/foxford1.htm</ref>\nMayo has remained an essentially rural community to the present day.\n\n===Mayo in the [[Annals of Lough C\u00e9]]===\n* ''1458.

From 388,887 in 1841, the population fell to 199,166 in 1901. The population reached a low of 109,525 in 1971 as emigration continued. Emigration slowed down as the Irish economy began to expand in the 1990s and early 2000s. Consequently, the population of Mayo increased from 110,713 in 1991 to 130,638 in 2011.\n\n===Religion===\nAccording to figures in the 2006 National Census the religious demographic breakdown for County Mayo was 114,215 Roman Catholics, 2,476 Church of Ireland, 733 Muslims, 409 other Christians, 280 Presbyterians, 250 Orthodox Christians, 204 Methodists, 853 other stated religions, 3,267 no religion and 1,152 no stated religion.\n\n===Irish language===\n9% of the population of County Mayo live in the [[Gaeltacht]]. The Gaeltacht Irish-speaking region in County Mayo is the third largest in Ireland with 10,886 inhabitants. [[Tourmakeady]] is the largest village in this area. All schools in the area use Irish as the language of instruction. Mayo has four gaelscoileanna in its four major towns, providing primary education to students through Irish.<ref>http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/category/schools/primary/mayo/?lang=en</ref>\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Mayo border sign.jpg|thumb|right|County border sign on the N60 road|280px]]\n\n===Rail===\nMayo is well served by rail travel.

Unusually for an area of Northern Ireland, there are few Presbyterians in Fermanagh.  Most of the Protestants are members of the Church of Ireland and there is also a Methodist community.<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/ni/religion.htm</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Cuilcagh Stairway.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Cuilcagh]] range, on the Cavan/Fermanagh border.]]\n[[File:Lower Lough Erne - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|Lower [[Lough Erne]]]]\nFermanagh is by far the smallest of Northern's Ireland's six counties in terms of population, with just over one-third of the population of Northern Ireland's next smallest county, [[County Armagh|Armagh]]. It is the second smallest county in Northern Ireland by area and is ranked 25th in Ireland by size. Fermanagh borders [[County Tyrone]] to the north-east, [[County Monaghan]] to the south-east, [[County Cavan]] to the south-west, [[County Leitrim]] to the west and [[County Donegal]] to the north-west. The county town, Enniskillen, is the largest settlement in Fermanagh, situated in the middle of the county.\n\nIt is mainly rural, with a population density of 36.1 people per km2, and is situated largely in the basin of the [[River Erne]]. It is dominated by two connected lakes: Upper and Lower [[Lough Erne]], and, including water, spans an area of 1,851&nbsp;km\u00b2 (715&nbsp;sq;&nbsp;mi).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/County+Fermanagh |title=County Fermanagh - definition of County Fermanagh by The Free Dictionary |website=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}</ref> It is approximately {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Belfast]] and {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Dublin]].\n\nUnder [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Fermanagh experiences a maritime [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate]] with cold winters, mild humid summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. Fermanagh accounts for 13.2% of the land mass of Northern Ireland and 30% of Fermanagh is covered with lakes and waterways. With 24,000 hectares of forest cover, or approximately 14% of total land area, Fermanagh is well above both the UK and Irish national averages. Due to its expansive lakelands and scenic rural countryside, much of the county is set to be designated an [[Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].\n\n===Geology===\nThe county is situated over a sequence of prominent faults, primarily the [[Killadeas \u2013 Seskinore Fault]], the [[Tempo \u2013 Sixmilecross Fault]], the [[Belcoo Fault]] and the [[Clogher Valley Fault]] which cross-cuts Lough Erne. To the north of Lough Erne, the oldest rocks in the county are found. These are [[red beds]] that were formed approximately 550 million years ago. In eastern Fermanagh there are extensive [[sandstones]] that were laid down during the Devonian, 400 million years ago. Much of the rest of the county's bedrock geology dates from the [[Carboniferous]], 354 to 298 million years ago. These rocks are primarily marine muds, shales and [[limestones]], which have produced extensive cave systems such as the [[Shannon Cave]], the [[Marble Arch Caves]] and the [[Caves of the Tullybrack and Belmore hills]]. These carboniferous shales aggregate across several counties in the northwest of Ireland - known colloquially as the [[Lough Allen]] basin - and are estimated to contain 9.4 trillion cubic metres of [[natural gas]], equivalent to 1.5 billion [[Barrel (unit)|barrels of oil]] (approximately $115 billion at 2018 prices).<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/what-s-your-fracking-problem-1.594199 The Irish Times, 2011 - \"What's your fracking problem?\"]</ref>\n\nThe county has three prominent upland areas, the expansive [[Knockmore|West Fermanagh Scarplands]] to the southwest of Lough Erne, which rise to some 350m, the [[Sliabh Beagh]] hills to the east on the Monaghan border, and the [[Breifne Mountains|Breifne mountain range]] along Fermanagh's southern border, which contain [[Cuilcagh]], the county's highest point, at 665m.\n\n==History==\nThe Menapii are the only known Celtic tribe specifically named on [[Ptolemy]]\u2019s 150 AD map of [[Ireland]], where they located their first colony- Menapia \u2013 on the [[Leinster]] coast circa 216 BC. They later settled around [[Lough Erne]], becoming known as the Fir Manach, and giving their name to [[Fermanagh]] and [[Monaghan]]. [[Mong\u00e1n mac Fiachnai]], a 7th-century King of [[Ulster]], is the protagonist of several legends linking him with [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir]]. They spread across [[Ireland]], evolving into historic Irish (also Scottish and Manx) clans.\n\nThe [[Annals of Ulster]] which cover medieval Ireland between AD 431 to AD 1540 were written at Belle Isle on [[Lough Erne]] near [[Lisbellaw]].\n\nFermanagh was a stronghold of the [[Maguire of Fermanagh|Maguire clan]] and Donn Carrach Maguire (died 1302) was the first of the chiefs of the Maguire dynasty. However, on the confiscation of lands relating to [[Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh)|Hugh Maguire]], Fermanagh was divided in similar manner to the other five escheated counties among Scottish and English undertakers and native Irish. The baronies of [[Knockninny]] and [[Magheraboy]] were allotted to Scottish undertakers, those of [[Clankelly]], [[Magherastephana]] and [[Lurg]] to English undertakers and those of [[Clanawley]], [[Coole (barony)|Coole]], and [[Tirkennedy|Tyrkennedy]], to servitors and natives. The chief families to benefit under the new settlement were the families of Cole, Blennerhasset, Butler, Hume, and Dunbar.\n\nFermanagh was made into a county by statute of Elizabeth I, but it was not until the time of the [[Plantation of Ulster]] that it was finally brought under civil government.\n\nThe closure of all the lines of [[Great Northern Railway (Ireland)]] within County Fermanagh in 1957 left the county as the first non-island county in the UK without a railway service.\n\n==Administration==\n{{Historical populations\n|state=collapsed\n|1653|5498\n|1659|7102\n|1821|130997\n|1831|149763\n|1841|156481\n|1851|116047\n|1861|105768\n|1871|92794\n|1881|84879\n|1891|74170\n|1901|65430\n|1911|61836\n|1926|57984\n|1937|54569\n|1951|53044\n|1961|51531\n|1966|49886\n|1971|50255\n|1981|51594\n|1991|54033\n|2001|57527\n|2011|61170\n||footnote=<ref>For 1653 and 1659 figures from Civil Survey Census of those years, Paper of Mr Hardinge to Royal Irish Academy 14 March 1865.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/census|title=Central Statistics Office: 2011 Census|publisher=Cso.ie|accessdate=20 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.histpop.org|title=Histpop \u2013 The Online Historical Population Reports Website|publisher=Histpop.org|accessdate=20 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507023856/http://www.histpop.org/|archivedate=7 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |title=NISRA \u2013 Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency |publisher=Nisranew.nisra.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=20 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217095720/http://www.nisranew.nisra.gov.uk/census |archivedate=17 February 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Lee\n|first=JJ\n|editor-last=Goldstrom\n|editor-first=J.

After the re-organisation of local government in 2015, Fermanagh was still the only county wholly within one council area, namely [[Fermanagh and Omagh District Council]], albeit that it constituted only a part of that entity.\n\nFor the purposes of elections to the UK Parliament, the territory of Fermanagh is part of the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone Parliamentary Constituency]]. This constituency is renowned for high levels of voting{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} and for electing [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] [[hunger strike|hunger-striker]] [[Bobby Sands]] as a member of parliament in the [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, April 1981]], shortly before his death.\n\n==Industry and tourism==\nAgriculture and tourism are two of the most important industries in Fermanagh. The main types of farming in the area are beef, dairy, sheep, pigs and some poultry. Most of the agricultural land is used as grassland for grazing and silage or hay rather than for other crops.\n\nThe waterways are extensively used by cabin cruisers, other small pleasure craft and anglers. The main town of Fermanagh is [[Enniskillen]] ({{lang|ga|Inis Ceithleann}}, 'Ceithleann's island').

The southern and eastern portions of the country are mostly sparsely inhabited tropical rainforest, and inland tropical plains containing large estates or large livestock farms, oil and gas production facilities, small farming communities and indigenous tribes.\n\n==Main ==\n\nColombia usually classifies its geography into five [[natural regions]], from the [[Andes|Andes mountain range]], a region shared with [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]]; the [[Pacific Ocean]] [[Pacific Coast|coastal]] region shared with [[Panama]] and [[Ecuador]]; the [[Caribbean Sea]] coastal region, shared with Venezuela and Panama; the ''[[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]'' (plains), shared with Venezuela; to the [[Amazon Rainforest]] region shared with Venezuela, [[Brazil]], [[Peru]] and Ecuador. Colombia is the only South American country which borders both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.\n\nDespite this ''[[The World Factbook]]'' makes no difference between [[Amazon River|Amazon]] region of Colombia (predominantly jungle) and the Orinoquia region of Colombia (predominantly plains). ''The World Factbook'' considers most appropriate to divide the country into four geographic regions: the Andean highlands, consisting of the three Andean ranges and intervening valley lowlands; the Caribbean lowlands coastal region; the Pacific lowlands coastal region, separated from the Caribbean lowlands by swamps at the base of the Isthmus of Panama; and eastern Colombia, the great plain that lies to the east of the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]].\n\nThe chief western mountain range, the [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|Cordillera Occidental]], is a moderately high range with peaks reaching up to about {{convert|15000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} (4,670 m).<ref name=\"andesmap\">{{cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=\n  | title=Travel map of the Andes\n  | work = \n  | publisher = Nelles Map\n  | date = \n  | url=http://andes.zoom-maps.com/\n  | accessdate=2011-01-10}}\n</ref> The [[Cauca River Valley]], an important agricultural region with several large cities on its borders, separates the Cordillera Occidental from the massive [[Cordillera Central, Colombia|Cordillera Central]]. Several snow-clad volcanoes in the Cordillera Central have summits that rise above {{convert|17000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The valley of the slow-flowing and muddy [[Magdalena River]], a major transportation artery, separates the Cordillera Central from the main eastern range, the Cordillera Oriental. The peaks of the Cordillera Oriental are moderately high. This range differs from Colombia's other mountain ranges in that it contains several large basins. In the east, the sparsely populated, flat to gently rolling eastern lowlands called ''[[plain|llanos]]'' cover almost 60 percent of the country's total land area.\n\nThis cross section of the republic does not include two of Colombia's regions: the Caribbean coastal lowlands and the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], both in the northern part of the country. The lowlands in the west are mostly swampy; the reed-filled marshes of the area are called ''ci\u00e9nagas'' by the people of Colombia. The [[Guajira Peninsula]] in the east is semiarid. The [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] is a spectacular triangular snowcapped block of rock that towers over the eastern part of this lowland. Here can be found the highest peak of the country named [[Pico Cristobal Colon]] (5775 m).<ref name=\"andesmap\" />\n\n===Andean region===\n{{Main|Andean Region of Colombia}}\n\n[[Image:Rabanal.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[P\u00e1ramo of Rabanal]], [[Boyac\u00e1 Department|Boyac\u00e1]].]]\n[[Image:Usgs-glaciers-colombia.png|thumb|right|250px|Glaciers in Colombia.]]\n\nNear the Ecuadorian frontier, the Andes Mountains divide into three distinct, roughly parallel chains, called cordilleras, that extend northeastward almost to the [[Caribbean Sea]]. Altitudes reach more than {{convert|18700|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and mountain peaks are permanently covered with snow. The elevated basins and plateaus of these ranges have a moderate climate that provides pleasant living conditions and in many places enables farmers to harvest twice a year. Torrential rivers on the slopes of the mountains produce a large [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]] potential and add their volume to the navigable rivers in the valleys. In the late 1980s, approximately 78 percent of the country's population lived in the Andean highlands.\n\nThe Cordillera Occidental in the west, the Cordillera Central in the center, and the Cordillera Oriental in the east have different characteristics. Geologically, the Cordillera Occidental and the Cordillera Central form the western and eastern sides of a massive crystalline arch that extends from the Caribbean lowlands to the southern border of Ecuador. The Cordillera Oriental, however, is composed of folded stratified rocks overlying a crystalline core.\n\nThe Cordillera Occidental is relatively low and is the least populated of the three cordilleras. Summits are only about {{convert|9840|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level and do not have permanent snows. Few passes exist, although one that is about {{convert|4985|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level provides the major city of [[Santiago de Cali|Cali]] with an outlet to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The relatively low elevation of the cordillera permits dense vegetation, which on the western slopes is truly tropical.\n\nThe Cordillera Occidental is separated from the Cordillera Central by the deep rift of the Cauca Valley. The R\u00edo Cauca rises within {{convert|124|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} of the border with [[Ecuador]] and flows through some of the best farmland in the country. After the two cordilleras converge, the Cauca Valley becomes a deep gorge all the way to the Caribbean lowlands.\n\nThe Cordillera Central is the loftiest of the mountain systems. Its crystalline rocks form a towering wall dotted with snow-covered volcanoes that is {{convert|500|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} long. There are no plateaus in this range and no passes under {{convert|10825|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. The highest peak in this range, the [[Nevado del Huila]], reaches {{convert|17602|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level. The second highest peak is a volcano, [[Nevado del Ruiz]], which erupted violently on November 13, 1985. Toward its northern end, this cordillera separates into several branches that descend toward the Caribbean coast.\n\nBetween the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Oriental flows the [[Magdalena River]]. This {{convert|1600|km|mi|0|adj=on|sp=us}}-long river rises near a point some {{convert|180|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of the border with Ecuador, where the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Central diverge. Its spacious drainage area is fed by numerous mountain torrents originating high in the snowfields. The Magdalena River is generally navigable from the Caribbean Sea as far as the town of [[Neiva, Huila|Neiva]], deep in the interior, but is interrupted midway by rapids. The valley floor is very deep; nearly {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the river's mouth the elevation is no more than about {{convert|300|m|ft|0|sp=us}}.\n\nIn the Cordillera Oriental at elevations between {{convert|2500|and|2700|m|ft|0|sp=us}}, three large fertile basins and a number of small ones provide suitable areas for settlement and intensive economic production. In the basin of [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]], where the Spanish found the Chibcha Indians, the European invaders established the town of Santa Fe de Bogot\u00e1 (present-day [[Bogot\u00e1]]) at an elevation of {{convert|2650|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level.\n\nTo the north of Bogot\u00e1, in the densely populated basins of [[Chiquinquir\u00e1]] and [[Boyac\u00e1 Department|Boyac\u00e1]], are fertile fields, rich mines, and large industrial establishments that produce much of the national wealth. Still farther north, where the Cordillera Oriental makes an abrupt turn to the northwest near the border with [[Venezuela]], the highest point of this range, the Sierra Nevada de Cocuy, rises to {{convert|5493|m|ft|0|sp=us}} above sea level. In the [[Santander Department|department of Santander]], the valleys on the western slopes are more spacious, and agriculture is intensive in the area around [[Bucaramanga]]. The northernmost region of the range around [[C\u00facuta]] is so rugged that historically it has been easier to maintain communications and transportation with Venezuela than with the adjacent parts of Colombia.\n\n===Caribbean region===\n{{Main|Caribbean Region of Colombia|Caribbean Natural Region, Colombia}}\n[[Image:Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta desde el espacio.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], the highest standing mountain by the sea.]]\n\nThe Caribbean lowlands consist of all of Colombia north of an imaginary line extending northeastward from the [[Gulf of Urab\u00e1|Golfo de Urab\u00e1]] to the Venezuelan frontier at the northern extremity of the Cordillera Oriental. The semiarid [[Guajira Peninsula]] and [[Guajira-Barranquilla xeric scrub]], in the extreme north, bear little resemblance to the rest of the region. In the southern part rises the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], an isolated mountain system with peaks reaching heights over {{convert|5700|m|ft|0|sp=us}} and slopes generally too steep for cultivation.\n\nThe Caribbean lowlands region is in roughly the shape of a triangle, the longest side of which is the coastline. Most of the country's commerce moves through Cartagena, Barranquilla, Santa Marta, and the other ports located along this important coast. Inland from these cities are swamps, hidden streams, and shallow lakes that support banana and cotton plantations, countless small farms, and, in higher places, cattle ranches.\n\nThe city of Cartagena is a petrochemical, seaport(#1 in the country) and tourist city(#1 in the country). Santa Marta is also a seaport and tourist city but is a smaller-scale city by comparison. Barranquilla is located some {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} from the Caribbean coastline but it is a more  developed city with a greater number of industries and commercial places, widely known for its abilities in all forms of metalwork and construction . Its inhabitants have the highest education level of the region and the city is famous for  being the starting point and focus of the region and the country's development as the first city in the country with the use of phones, public lighting, air mail, planes and industrial works.\n\nThe Caribbean region merges next to and is connected with the Andean highlands through the two great river valleys. After the Andean highlands, it is the second most important region in economic activity. Approximately 17% of the country's population lived in this region in the late 1980s.\n\nThe region also includes the peninsular archipelago of [[San Andres Island]] and the Insular Territories of Colombia, which are disputed in part by Nicaragua. However, the Colombian Navy protects such territories with the use of force when necessary to avoid foreign invasion and the islands are home to 2 important bases for defense and custom controls, formerly used for research of classified projects with civilian assistance as the local universities often research in the area of oceanography and marine biology but also in the fields of biochemistry, genetics, immunology and Colombia is known for its advances in medical fields in experimental surgery, breast implant development or prosthetics and immunology and these facilities serve as containment and secure experimentation labs to complement those in Barranquilla and other undisclosed locations within the coast territories.\n\nThe '''Insular Region''' is considered by some as a [[geopolitical]] region of [[Colombia]] which comprises the areas outside the [[continental territories]] of [[Colombia]] and includes the [[San Andr\u00e9s y Providencia Department]] in the [[Caribbean sea]] and the [[Malpelo Island|Malpelo]] and [[Gorgona, Colombia|Gorgona]] Islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The Insular region subregions include other group of [[island]]s;\n\n* [[Archipi\u00e9lago de San Bernardo]] (in the [[Morrosquillo Gulf]], Caribbean).\n* [[Islas del Rosario]] (Caribbean)\n* [[Isla Fuerte]] (Caribbean)\n* [[Isla Bar\u00fa]] (Caribbean)\n* [[Isla Tortuguilla]] (Caribbean)\n* [[Isla Tierra Bomba]] (Caribbean)\n\n===Pacific region===\n{{Main|Pacific Region of Colombia}}\n\nThe western third of the country is the most geographically complex. Starting at the shore of the Pacific Ocean in the west and moving eastward at a latitude of [[5th parallel north|5 degrees north]], a diverse sequence of features is encountered. In the extreme west are the very narrow and discontinuous Pacific coastal lowlands, which are backed by the [[Baud\u00f3 Mountains|Serran\u00eda de Baud\u00f3]], the lowest and narrowest of Colombia's mountain ranges. Next is the broad region of the [[Atrato River|R\u00edo Atrato]]/[[San Juan River (Colombia)|R\u00edo San Juan]] lowland, which has been proposed as a possible alternate to the [[Panama Canal]] as a human-made route between the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. Colombia occupies most of the Andes mountain range northern extremity sharing a bit with Venezuela which splits into three branches between the Colombia-Ecuador border.\n\nIn the 1980s, only 3% of all Colombians resided in the Pacific lowlands, a region of jungle and swamp with considerable but little-exploited potential in minerals and other resources. Buenaventura is the only port of any size on the coast. On the east, the Pacific lowlands are bounded by the Cordillera Occidental, from which numerous streams run. Most of the streams flow westward to the Pacific, but the largest, the navigable R\u00edo Atrato, flows northward to the Golfo de Urab\u00e1, making the river settlements accessible to the major Atlantic ports and commercially related primarily to the Caribbean lowlands hinterland. To the west of the R\u00edo Atrato rises the [[Baud\u00f3 Mountains|Serran\u00eda de Baud\u00f3]], an isolated chain of low mountains that occupies a large part of the region. Its highest elevation is less than 1,800 meters, and its vegetation resembles that of the surrounding tropical forest.\n\nThe [[Dari\u00e9n Gap|Atrato Swamp]]\u2014in Choc\u00f3 Department adjoining the border with Panama\u2014is a deep muck sixty-five kilometers in width that for years has challenged engineers seeking to complete the [[Pan-American Highway]]. This stretch, near [[Turbo, Colombia|Turbo]], where the highway is interrupted is known as the Tap\u00f3n del Choc\u00f3 (Chocon Plug). A second major transportation project involving Choc\u00f3 Department has been proposed. A second interoceanic canal would be constructed by dredging the R\u00edo Atrato and other streams and digging short access canals. Completion of either of these projects would do much to transform this region, although it could have devastating consequences on the fragile environment.\n\n===Orinoqu\u00eda region===\n{{Main|Orinoqu\u00eda Region of Colombia}}\n\nThe area east of the Andes includes about 699,300 square kilometers or three-fifths of the country's total area, but Colombians view it almost as an alien land. The entire area, known as the eastern plains, was home to only 2% of the country's population in the late 1980s. The Spanish term for [[plain]]s (''llanos'') can be applied only to the open plains in the northern part, particularly the Piedmont areas near the Cordillera Oriental, where extensive cattle raising is practiced.\n\nThe region is unbroken by highlands except in [[Meta Department]], where the [[Serran\u00eda de la Macarena]], an outlier of the Andes has unique vegetation and wildlife believed to be reminiscent of those that once existed throughout the Andes.\n\n===Amazon region===\n{{Main|Amazon Region of Colombia}}\n\nMany of the numerous large rivers of eastern Colombia are navigable. The [[R\u00edo Guaviare]] and the streams to its north flow eastward and drain into the basin of the [[R\u00edo Orinoco]], a river that crosses into Venezuela and flows into the Atlantic Ocean. Those south of the R\u00edo Guaviare flows into the [[Amazon Basin]]. The R\u00edo Guaviare divides eastern Colombia into the llanos subregion in the north and the tropical rainforest, or selva, subregion in the south.\n\n==Climate==\n{{main|Climate of Colombia}}\n[[File:Colombia K\u00f6ppen.svg|thumb|300px|Colombia map of [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]].]]\n[[Image:Colombia.A2004117.1535.250m.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Flooding in Colombia, April 2004]]\n\nThe striking variety in temperature and precipitation results principally from differences in elevation. Temperatures range from very hot at sea level to relatively cold at higher elevations but vary little with the season. At Bogot\u00e1, for example, the average annual temperature is {{convert|15|\u00b0C}}, and the difference between the average of the coldest and the warmest months is less than 1&nbsp;\u00b0C (1.8&nbsp;\u00b0F). More significant, however, is the daily variation in temperature, from {{convert|5|\u00b0C}} at night to {{convert|17|\u00b0C|1}} during the day.\n\nColombians customarily describe their country in terms of the climatic zones: the area under {{convert|900|m|ft|0|sp=us}} in elevation is called the hot zone (tierra caliente), elevations between {{convert|900|and|1980|m|ft|0|sp=us}} are the temperate zone (tierra templada), and elevations from {{convert|1980|m|ft|0|sp=us}} to about {{convert|3500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} constitute the cold zone (tierra fr\u00eda). The upper limit of the cold zone marks the tree line and the approximate limit of human habitation. The treeless regions adjacent to the cold zone and extending to approximately {{convert|4500|m|ft|0|sp=us}} are high, bleak areas (usually referred to as the p\u00e1ramos), above which begins the area of permanent snow (nevado).\n\nAbout 86% of the country's total area lies in the hot zone. Included in the hot zone and interrupting the temperate area of the Andean highlands are the long and narrow extension of the Magdalena Valley and a small extension in the Cauca Valley. Temperatures, depending on elevation, vary between {{convert|24|and|38|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, and there are alternating dry and wet seasons corresponding to summer and winter, respectively. Breezes on the Caribbean coast, however, reduce both heat and precipitation.\n\nRainfall in the hot zone is heaviest in the Pacific lowlands and in parts of eastern Colombia, where rain is almost a daily occurrence and rain forests predominate. Precipitation exceeds {{convert|7600|mm|in|1|sp=us}} annually in most of the Pacific lowlands, making this one of the wettest regions in the world. The highest average annual precipitation in the world is estimated to be in Lloro, Colombia, with {{convert|13299|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20020927021958/http://www0.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation]. ''[[National Climatic Data Center]]''.  August 9, 2005.  Last accessed January 18, 2007.</ref> In eastern Colombia, it decreases from {{convert|6350|mm|in|0|sp=us}} in portions of the Andean piedmont to {{convert|2540|mm|in|0|sp=us}} eastward. Extensive areas of the Caribbean interior are permanently flooded, more because of poor drainage than because of the moderately heavy precipitation during the rainy season from May through October.\n\nThe temperate zone covers about 8% of the country. This zone includes the lower slopes of the Cordillera Oriental and the Cordillera Central and most of the intermontane valleys. The important cities of Medell\u00edn ({{convert|1487|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}) and Cali ({{convert|1030|m|ft|0|sp=us|disp=or}}) are located in this zone, where rainfall is moderate and the mean annual temperature varies between {{convert|19|and|24|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, depending on the elevation. In the higher elevations of this zone, farmers benefit from two wet and two dry seasons each year; January through March and July through September are the dry seasons.\n\n[[Image:Rio Atrato.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Atrato River]].]]\n\nThe cold or cool zone constitutes about 6% of the total area, including some of the most densely populated plateaus and terraces of the Colombian Andes; this zone supports about onefourth of the country's total population. The mean temperature ranges between {{convert|10|and|19|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, and the wet seasons occur in April and May and from September to December, as in the high elevations of the temperate zone.\n\nPrecipitation is moderate to heavy in most parts of the country; the heavier rainfall occurs in the low-lying hot zone. Considerable variations occur because of local conditions that affect wind currents, however, and areas on the leeward side of the Guajira Peninsula receive generally light rainfall; the annual rainfall of {{convert|350|mm|in|1|sp=us}} recorded at the Uribia station there is the lowest in Colombia. Considerable year-to-year variations have been recorded, and Colombia sometimes experiences droughts.\n\nColombia's geographic and climatic variations have combined to produce relatively well-defined \"ethnocultural\" groups among different regions of the country: the Coste\u00f1o from the Caribbean coast; the Caucano in the Cauca region and the Pacific coast; the Antioque\u00f1o in Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, and Valle del Cauca departments; the Tolimense in Tolima and Huila departments; the Cundiboyacense in the interior departments of Cundinamarca and Boyac\u00e1 in the Cordillera Oriental; the Santandereano in Norte de Santander and Santander departments; and the Llanero in the eastern plains. Each group has distinctive characteristics, accents, customs, social patterns, and forms of cultural adaptation to climate and topography that differentiates it from other groups. Even with rapid urbanization and modernization, regionalism and regional identification continued to be important reference points, although they were somewhat less prominent in the 1980s than in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.\n\nColombia's proximity to the equator influences its climates. The lowland areas are continuously hot. Altitude affects temperature greatly. Temperatures decrease about {{convert|3.5|F-change}} for every {{convert|1000|ft|m|0|adj=on}} increase in altitude above sea level. Rainfall varies by location in Colombia, tending to increase as one travels southward. This is especially true in the eastern lowlands. For example, rainfall in parts of the [[Guajira Peninsula]] seldom exceeds {{convert|30|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year. Colombia's rainy southeast, however, is often drenched by more than {{convert|200|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain per year. Rainfall in most of the rest of the country runs between these two extremes.\n\n==Vegetation==\n{{See also|Fauna of Colombia|Flora of Colombia}}\n\nAltitude affects not only temperature, but also vegetation. In fact, altitude is one of the most important influences on vegetation patterns in Colombia. The mountainous parts of the country can be divided into several vegetation zones according to altitude, although the altitude limits of each zone may vary somewhat depending on the latitude.\n\nThe \"tierra caliente\" (hot land), below {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}}, is the zone of tropical crops such as bananas. The tierra templada (temperate land), extending from an altitude of {{convert|1000|to|2000|m|abbr=on}}, is the zone of coffee and maize. Wheat and potatoes dominate in the \"tierra fr\u00eda\" (cold land), at altitudes from {{convert|2000|to|3200|m|abbr=on}}. In the \"zona forestada\" (forested zone), which is located between {{convert|3200|and|4000|m|abbr=on}}, many of the trees have been cut for firewood. Treeless pastures dominate the p\u00e1ramos, or alpine grasslands, at altitudes of {{convert|4000|to|4500|m|abbr=on}}. Above {{convert|4500|m|abbr=on}}, where temperatures are below freezing, is the \"tierra helada\", a zone of permanent snow and ice.\n\nVegetation also responds to rainfall patterns. A scrub woodland of scattered trees and bushes dominates the semiarid northeast. To the south, savannah (tropical grassland) vegetation covers the Colombian portion of the llanos. The rainy areas in the southeast are blanketed by tropical rainforest. In the mountains, the spotty patterns of precipitation in alpine areas complicate vegetation patterns. The rainy side of a mountain may be lush and green, while the other side, in the rain shadow, may be parched.\n\n==Relief==\n[[Image:Mapa de Colombia (relieve).svg|thumb|right|250px|Relief map of Colombia]]\n\nThe Andean range is located in Colombia from the southwest (Ecuador border) toward the northeast (Venezuela border) and is divided in the [[Colombian Massif]] (''Macizo Colombiano'') in three ranges ([[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|East Andes]], [[Cordillera Central (Colombia)|Central Andes]] and [[Cordillera Occidental (Colombia)|West Andes]]) that form two long valleys, [[Magdalena River Valley|Magdalena]] and [[Valle del Cauca|Cauca]] follow by the rivers of the same name.\n\nThe eastern half of Colombia, comprising more than half its territory, is plain and composed by [[savanna]] and [[rainforest]], crossed by rivers belonging to the [[Amazon River|Amazon]] and [[Orinoco]] basins.  The northern part, called \"Los [[Los Llanos, Venezuela|Llanos]]\" is a savanna region, mostly in the Orinoco basin (therefore called also Orinoqu\u00eda).  The southern part is covered by the Amazon rain forest and belongs mostly to the Amazon basin.  It is usually called Amazon\u00eda.\n\nAt the north and west of the Andes range there are some coastal plains.  The Caribbean plains at the north and the Pacific plains at the west.\n\nColombian Pacific Plains are among the most rainy parts in the world, chiefly at the north ([[Department of Choc\u00f3|Choc\u00f3]]).\n\nThe highest mountain in Colombia is not in the Andes but in the Caribbean plain: [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] with its highest points named Pico Cristobal Colon (5775 m) and Pico Simon Bolivar (same elevation).  Other mountains in the Caribbean plain include the [[Montes de Mar\u00eda]] and the [[Serran\u00eda de San Lucas]].\n\nIn the Pacific Plains there are other mountain formations, chiefly the [[Serran\u00eda del Dari\u00e9n]] and the [[Serran\u00eda del Baud\u00f3]].\n\nIn the eastern Region, there is the [[Serran\u00eda de la Macarena]] and there are formations belonging to the [[Guyana Shield]].\n\n==Protected areas==\n{{Main|List of national parks of Colombia}}\n\n[[Image:Mapa de Colombia (parques naturales).svg|thumb|right|250px|National natural parks of Colombia.]]\n\n==Natural resources==\n{{main|Natural resources of Colombia}}\n\nThe natural resources of Colombia are varied and extensive with most of its territory and oceans still unexplored. Colombia has one of the largest  open pit coal mines in the world in the region of [[Cerrejon]] in the [[Guajira Peninsula]]. It also has oil rigs and natural gas extraction in the eastern plains. Colombia is the main producer of [[emerald]]s and an important participant in gold, silver, iron, salt, platinum, petroleum, nickel, copper, hydropower and uranium extraction.<ref name=ENCARTA>[http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564636_2/Colombia.html Encyclopedia Encarta: Natural Resources of Colombia] Encyclopedia Encarta Accessed 24 August 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpi5Euw?url=http://es.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564636_2/Colombia.html |date=2009-11-01 }} 2009-10-31.</ref>\n\n==Environmental issues==\n{{Main|Environmental issues in Colombia}}\n\n[[Image:Colombia land 1970.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Land use map of Colombia, 1970.]]\n[[Image:Colombia econ 1970.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Economic activity map of Colombia, 1970.]]\n\nThe main environmental issues affecting Colombia are deforestation; soil and water quality damage from overuse of pesticides; air pollution, especially in Bogota, from vehicle emissions and other main cities. The collateral damaged produced by attacks against oil pipeline infrastructure by rebel guerrillas in the Colombian armed conflict has produced long term damage to the environment. The armed groups also deforest large areas to cultivate illegal crops and open unauthorized highways in protected areas.\n\n==Extreme points==\n{{Main|Extreme points of Colombia}}\n;Highest points:\n\nSnowfields and glaciers in Colombia are limited to the highest peaks and ranges in the Cordillera Central and Cordillera Oriental and above the 4,700-meter elevation on the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The total area of snowfields and glaciers was estimated to be about 104 square kilometers in the early 1970s.\n\nHistorical, geographical, and pictorial records point toward a consistent and progressive depletion of ice-and-snow masses in the Colombian Andes since the end of the \"Little Ice Age\" in the late 1800s. Many glaciers have disappeared during the 20th century, and others are expected to disappear in the coming decades.<ref name=USGS>[http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386i/colombia/intro.html USGS: Glaciers of Colombia] USGS Accessed 23 August 2007.</ref>\n\n==Facts==\nLand boundaries:   \ntotal: 6,6724&nbsp;km\n\nCoastline:   \n3,208&nbsp;km (Caribbean Sea 1,760&nbsp;km, North Pacific Ocean 1,448&nbsp;km)\n\nClimate:   \ntropical along coast and eastern plains; cooler in highlands\n\nTerrain:   \nflat coastal lowlands, central highlands, high Andes Mountains, eastern lowland plains\n\nElevation extremes:   \nlowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 m \nhighest point: Pico Cristobal Colon 5,975 m \nnote: nearby Pico Simon Bolivar also has the same elevation\n\nNatural resources:   \npetroleum, natural gas, coal, iron ore, nickel, gold, copper, emeralds, hydropower\n\nLand use:   \narable land: 1.43% \npermanent crops: 1.68% \nother: 96.89% (2012)\n\nIrrigated land:   \n10,870&nbsp;km\u00b2 (2011)\n\nTotal renewable water resources:\n2,132&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (2011)\n\nFreshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural):\ntotal: 12.65&nbsp;km<sup>3</sup> (55%/4%/41%)\nper capita: 308 m<sup>3</sup>/yr (2010)\n\nNatural hazards:   \nhighlands subject to volcanic eruptions; occasional earthquakes; periodic droughts\n\nEnvironment - international agreements:   \nparty to: Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, [[Climate Change]], [[Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol]], [[Desertification]], Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, [[Tropical Timber 83]], [[Tropical Timber 94]], Wetlands \nsigned, but not ratified: [[Law of the Sea]]\n\n==Hydrology==\n{{see also|List of rivers in Colombia}}\n\nColombia has four main drainage systems: the Pacific drain, the Caribbean drain, the Orinoco Basin and the Amazon Basin.\n\nThe [[Orinoco]] and [[Amazon River|Amazon]] Rivers mark limits with Colombia to [[Venezuela]] and [[Peru]] respectively.\n\n{|\n|- bgcolor=\"cccccc\"\n!width=\"25%\"|Caribbean Drain\n!width=\"25%\"|Pacifice Drain\n!width=\"25%\"|Orinoco Basin\n!width=\"25%\"|Amazon Basin\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\" align=\"left\"|\n\n===Rivers confined to Colombia===\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Caribe-->\n*[[Atrato River|Atrato]]\n*[[Cauca River|Cauca]]\n*[[Magdalena River|Magdalena]]\n*[[Nech\u00ed River|Nech\u00ed]]\n*[[Sin\u00fa River|Sin\u00fa]]\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Pac\u00edfico-->\n*[[Baud\u00f3]]\n*[[Pat\u00eda River|Pat\u00eda]]\n*[[San Juan River (Colombia)|San Juan]]\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Orinoco-->\n*[[Guaviare River|Guaviare]]\n*[[In\u00edrida River|In\u00edrida]]\n*[[Meta River|Meta]]\n*[[Vichada River|Vichada]]\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Amazonas-->\n*[[Apaporis]]\n*[[Cagu\u00e1n River|Cagu\u00e1n]]\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\" align=\"left\"|\n\n===Rivers originating in Colombia===\n|-\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Caribe-->\n*[[Catatumbo]]\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Pac\u00edfico-->\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Orinoco-->\n*[[Arauca River|Arauca]]\n|valign=\"top\"|<!--Amazonas-->\n*[[Caquet\u00e1 River|Caquet\u00e1]]\n*[[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Guain\u00eda]]\n*[[Putumayo River]]\n*[[Vaup\u00e9s River|Vaup\u00e9s]]\n|}\n\n===Lakes===\n[[File:Rio magdalena mundung.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The mouth of the [[Magdalena River]] and the [[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]].]]\n*[[Ci\u00e9naga Grande de Santa Marta]]\n*[[La Cocha Lagoon]]\n*[[Lake Tota]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Environmental issues in Colombia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*{{loc}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook}}\n* Mellander, Gustavo A.; Nelly Maldonado Mellander (1999).

[[Executive power]] is carried out by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the two chambers of [[Congress of Colombia|congress]], the [[Senate of Colombia|Senate]] and the [[House of Representatives of Colombia]]. The [[Judiciary]] is independent of the executive and the legislature.

The constitution expanded citizens' basic rights, including that of \"tutela,\" under which an immediate court action can be requested by an individual if he or she feels that their constitutional rights are being violated and if there is no other [[legal recourse]].\n\nThe national government has separate executive, legislative, and judicial branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\n{{See also|President of Colombia}}\n[[File:Casa-narino-1-fachada.jpg|thumb|[[Casa de Nari\u00f1o]], seat of the [[executive power]].]]\nThe president is elected for a four-year term and, since 2005, can be re-elected for one consecutive term. The 1991 constitution reestablished the position of [[Vice President of Colombia|vice president]], who is elected on the same ticket as the president. By law, the vice president will succeed in the event of the president's resignation, illness, or death.\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{See also|Congress of Colombia}}\n[[File:CapitolioNacionalDeColombia2004-7.jpg|thumb|[[Congress of Colombia]] in [[Bogot\u00e1]].]]\nColombia's bicameral Congress consists of a 102-member [[Senate of Colombia]] and a 161-member [[Chamber of Representatives of Colombia]]. Senators are elected on the basis of a nationwide ballot, while representatives are elected in multi member districts co-located within the 32 national departments. The country's capital is a separate capital district and elects its own representatives. Members may be re-elected indefinitely, and, in contrast to the previous system, there are no alternate congressmen. Congress meets twice a year, and the president has the power to call it into special session when needed.\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Colombia|Elections in Colombia}}\n{{Colombian presidential election, 2006}}\n{{Colombian Chamber of Representatives election, 2006}}\n{{Colombian Senate election, 2006}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\n\n[[File:PalacioDeJusticia2004-7-9Bogota.jpg|thumb|[[Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia]].]]\nThe civilian judiciary is a separate and independent branch of government. Guidelines and the general structure for Colombia's administration of justice are set out in Law 270 of March 7, 1996. Colombia's legal system has recently begun to incorporate some elements of an oral, accusatorial system. The judicial branch's general structure is composed of four distinct jurisdictions (civilian, administrative, constitutional, and special). Colombia's highest judicial organs include the Supreme Court, the State Council, the Constitutional Court, and the Superior Judicial Council. This sometimes leads to conflicting opinions since there is no one court which clearly has authority over the decisions of the other three.\n\n==International organization participation==\n[[Central American Bank for Economic Integration|BCIE]], [[Andean Community of Nations|CAN]], [[Caribbean Development Bank|CDB]], [[South American Community of Nations|CSN]], [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[G3 Free Trade Agreement|G-3]], [[Group of 24|G-24]], [[Group of 77|G-77]], [[Inter-American Development Bank|IADB]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency|IAEA]], [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development|IBRD]], [[ICAO]], [[International Chamber of Commerce|ICC]], [[International Criminal Court|ICCt]], [[International Trade Union Confederation|ITUC]], [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|ICRM]], [[International Development Association|IDA]], [[IFAD]], [[International Finance Corporation|IFC]], [[IFRCS]], [[IHO]], [[International Labour Organization|ILO]], [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]], [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], [[Interpol (organization)|Interpol]], [[IOC]], [[International Organization for Migration|IOM]], [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], [[ITU]], [[Latin American Economic System|LAES]], [[LAIA]], [[Mercosur]] (associate), [[MIGA]], [[Non-Aligned Movement|NAM]], [[Organization of American States|OAS]], [[OPANAL]], [[OPCW]], [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|PCA]], [[Rio Group|RG]], [[United Nations|UN]], [[Union of South American Nations|UNASUR]], [[UNCTAD]], [[UNESCO]], [[UNHCR]], [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization|UNIDO]], [[UPU]], [[World Customs Organization|WCO]], [[World Federation of Trade Unions|WFTU]], [[WHO]], [[WIPO]], [[WMO]], [[WToO]], [[World Trade Organization|WTO]]{{overly detailed inline|date=December 2014}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20020502010953/http://www.camararep.gov.co/ House of Representatives of Colombia]\n*[http://www.senado.gov.co/ Senate of Colombia]\n*[http://www.presidencia.gov.co/ Presidency of Colombia]\n*[http://www.cortesuprema.gov.co/ Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia]\n\n{{Colombia topics|state=uncollapsed}}\n{{Americas topic|Politics of}}\n{{Colombia conflict}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Politics Of Colombia}}\n[[Category:Politics of Colombia| ]]\n\n[[de:Kolumbien#Politik]]", "sha1": "iycey30pk72emp825trjtvnnmglyhon"}}]
