As a result of the major expansion of the station's power-generating capabilities, more pressurised modules could be accommodated, and the ''[[Harmony (ISS module)|Harmony]]'' node and ''Columbus'' European laboratory were added. These were soon followed by the first two components of ''Kib\u014d''. In March 2009, [[STS-119]] completed the Integrated Truss Structure with the installation of the fourth and final set of solar arrays. The final section of ''Kib\u014d'' was delivered in July 2009 on [[STS-127]], followed by the Russian ''[[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk]]'' module. The third node, ''[[Tranquility (ISS module)|Tranquility]]'', was delivered in February 2010 during [[STS-130]] by the Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'', alongside the [[Cupola (ISS module)|Cupola]], followed in May 2010 by the penultimate Russian module, ''[[Rassvet (ISS module)|Rassvet]]''. ''Rassvet'' was delivered by Space Shuttle ''Atlantis'' on [[STS-132]] in exchange for the Russian Proton delivery of the ''Zarya'' module in 1998 which had been funded by the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_mim1.html |title=Mini-Research Module 1 (MIM1) Rassvet (MRM-1) |publisher=Russianspaceweb.com |accessdate=12 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825094354/http://www.russianspaceweb.com/iss_mim1.html |archivedate=25 August 2011}}</ref> The last pressurised module of the USOS, ''Leonardo'', was brought to the station by ''Discovery'' on her final flight, [[STS-133]], in February 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts133/main/index.html |title=STS-133 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref> The [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] was delivered by ''Endeavour'' on [[STS-134]] the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/shuttlemissions/sts134/main/index.html |title=STS-134 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=1 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2011|06}}, the station consisted of 15 pressurised modules and the [[Integrated Truss Structure]].

The FGB provided electrical power, storage, propulsion, and guidance to the ISS during the initial stage of assembly. With the launch and assembly in orbit of other modules with more specialised functionality, ''Zarya'' is now primarily used for storage, both inside the pressurised section and in the externally mounted fuel tanks. ''Zarya'' is a descendant of the [[TKS (spacecraft)|TKS spacecraft]] designed for the Soviet [[Salyut programme]]. The name ''Zarya'' was given to the FGB because it signified the dawn of a new era of international co-operation in space. Although it was built by a Russian company, it is owned by the [[United States]]. ''Zarya'' weighs {{convert|19300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, is {{convert|12.55|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|4.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, discounting solar arrays.\n\n''Zarya'' was built from December 1994 to January 1998 at the [[Khrunichev State Research and Production Space Center]] (KhSC) in Moscow. The control system was developed by the Ukrainian [[Khartron]] corporation in [[Kharkiv]].\n\n''Zarya'' was launched on 20 November 1998, on a Russian [[Proton-K|Proton rocket]] from [[Baikonur Cosmodrome Site 81]] in [[Kazakhstan]] to a {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} high orbit with a designed lifetime of at least 15 years. After ''Zarya'' reached orbit, STS-88 launched on 4 December 1998, to attach the ''Unity'' module.\n\nAlthough only designed to fly autonomously for six to eight months, ''Zarya'' did so for almost two years because of delays with the Russian Service Module, ''Zvezda'', which finally launched on 12 July 2000, and docked with ''Zarya'' on 26 July using the Russian [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs docking system]].\n\n===''Unity''===\n[[File:ISS Unity module.jpg|thumb|left|''Unity'' as pictured by Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']]\n'''''[[Unity (ISS module)|Unity]]''''', or Node 1, is one of three nodes, or passive connecting modules, in the [[US Orbital Segment]] of the station. It was the first US-built component of the Station to be launched. The module is made of aluminium and cylindrical in shape, with six berthing locations facilitating connections to other modules. Essential space station resources such as fluids, environmental control and life support systems, electrical and data systems are routed through ''Unity'' to supply work and living areas of the station. More than 50,000 mechanical items, 216 lines to carry fluids and gases, and 121 internal and external electrical cables using six miles of wire were installed in the ''Unity'' node. Prior to its launch, conical Pressurized Mating Adapters (PMAs) were attached to the aft and forward berthing mechanisms of ''Unity''. ''Unity'' and the two mating adapters together weighed about {{convert|25600|lb|kg|order=flip|abbr=on}}. The adapters allow the docking systems used by the Space Shuttle and by Russian modules to attach to the node's hatches and berthing mechanisms.\n\n''Unity'' was carried into orbit by {{OV|105}} in 1998 as the primary cargo of [[STS-88]], the first Space Shuttle mission dedicated to assembly of the station. On 6 December 1998, the STS-88 crew mated the aft berthing port of ''Unity'' with the forward hatch of the already orbiting ''Zarya'' module.\n\n===''Zvezda''===\n'''''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]''''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0417\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0301}}, meaning \"star\"), also known as DOS-8, Service Module or SM ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u0421\u041c}}).

''Nauka'' contains an additional set of life support systems and attitude control. Originally it would have routed power from the single Science-and-Power Platform, but that single module design changed over the first ten years of the ISS mission, and the two science modules, which attach to ''Nauka'' via the [[Uzlovoy Module]], or Russian node, each incorporate their own large solar arrays to power Russian science experiments in the ROS.\n\n''Nauka''{{'s}} mission has changed over time. During the mid-1990s, it was intended as a backup for the FGB, and later as a universal docking module (UDM); its docking ports will be able to support automatic docking of both spacecraft, additional modules and fuel transfer. ''Nauka'' has its own engines. Like ''Zvezda'' and ''Zarya'', ''Nauka'' will be launched by a Proton rocket, while smaller Russian modules such as ''Pirs'' and ''Poisk'' were delivered by modified [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] spacecraft.

UM is due to be launched in late 2018. It will be integrated with a special version of the Progress cargo ship and launched by a standard Soyuz rocket. Progress would use its own propulsion and flight control system to deliver and dock the Node Module to the nadir (Earth-facing) docking port of the ''Nauka'' MLM/FGB-2 module. One port is equipped with an active hybrid docking port, which enables docking with the MLM module. The remaining five ports are passive hybrids, enabling docking of Soyuz and Progress vehicles, as well as heavier modules and future spacecraft with modified docking systems. The node module was conceived to serve as the only permanent element of the future Russian successor to the ISS, [[Orbital Piloted Assembly and Experiment Complex|OPSEK]]. Equipped with six docking ports, the Node Module would serve as a single permanent core of the future station with all other modules coming and going as their life span and mission required.<ref>[http://www.energia.ru/en/news/news-2011/news_01-13.html S.P.

To keep the internal ambient temperature within comfortable, workable limits, [[ammonia]] is continuously pumped through pipes throughout the station to collect heat, then into external radiators to emit infrared radiation, then back into the station.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast21mar_1/ |title=Staying Cool on the ISS |publisher=NASA |first1=Steve |last1=Price |first2=Tony |last2=Phillips |first3=Gil |last3=Knier |date=21 March 2001 |accessdate=22 July 2016}}</ref> Thus this passive thermal control system (PTCS) is made of external surface materials, insulation such as MLI, and heat pipes.\n\nIf the PTCS cannot keep up with the heat load, an External Active Thermal Control System (EATCS) maintains the temperature. The EATCS consists of an internal, non-toxic, water coolant loop used to cool and dehumidify the atmosphere, which transfers collected heat into an external liquid ammonia loop that can withstand the much lower temperature of space, and is circulated through radiators to remove the heat. The EATCS provides cooling for all the US pressurised modules, including ''Kib\u014d'' and ''Columbus'', as well as the main power distribution electronics of the S0, S1 and P1 trusses. It can reject up to 70&nbsp;kW.

Orbital boost burns would generally be delayed until after the shuttle's departure. This allowed shuttle payloads to be lifted with the station's engines during the routine firings, rather than have the shuttle lift itself and the payload together to a higher orbit. This trade-off allowed heavier loads to be transferred to the station.

Examples of ORUs are pumps, storage tanks, controller boxes, antennas, and battery units. Some units can be replaced using robotic arms. Many are stored outside the station, either on small pallets called [[ExPRESS Logistics Carrier]]s (ELCs) or share larger platforms called [[External Stowage Platform]]s which also hold science experiments. Both kinds of pallets have electricity as many parts which could be damaged by the cold of space require heating. The larger logistics carriers also have computer local area network connections (LAN) and telemetry to connect experiments.

rendezvous and dock to the space station without human intervention using the [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs]] docking system. Radar allows these vehicles to detect and intercept ISS from over 200 kilometres away. The European ATV uses star sensors and GPS to determine its intercept course. When it catches up it uses laser equipment to [[Computer vision|optically]] recognise ''Zvezda'', along with the Kurs system for redundancy. <!--At 4.5&nbsp;km the atv switches from AGPS to RGPS  -p--> Crew supervise these craft, but do not intervene except to send abort commands in emergencies. The Japanese [[H-II Transfer Vehicle]] parks itself in progressively closer orbits to the station, and then awaits 'approach' commands from the crew, until it is close enough for a robotic arm to grapple and berth the vehicle to the USOS.

GNC is set to allow the station to drift in space, rather than fire its thrusters or turn using gyroscopes. The solar panels of the station are turned edge-on to the incoming ships, so residue from its thrusters does not damage the cells. When a NASA [[Space Shuttle]] docked to the station, other ships were grounded, as the Shuttle's [[reinforced carbon-carbon]] wing leading edges, cameras, windows, and instruments were too much at risk from damage or contamination by thruster residue from other ships' movements.\n\nApproximately 30% of NASA shuttle launch delays were caused by poor weather. Occasional priority was given to the Soyuz arrivals at the station where the Soyuz carried crew with time-critical cargoes such as biological experiment materials, also causing shuttle delays. Departure of the NASA shuttle was often delayed or prioritised according to weather over its two landing sites.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2009/may/HQ_09-118_Shuttle_Landing_Delayed.html |title=NASA's Space Shuttle Landing Delayed by Weather |publisher=NASA |first1=Katherine |last1=Trinidad |first2=Candrea |last2=Thomas |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=26 June 2015}}</ref> Whilst the Soyuz is capable of landing anywhere, anytime, its planned landing time and place is chosen to give consideration to helicopter pilots and ground recovery crew, to give acceptable flying weather and lighting conditions.

The crew then eats breakfast and takes part in a daily planning conference with Mission Control before starting work at around 08:10. The first scheduled exercise of the day follows, after which the crew continues work until 13:05. Following a one-hour lunch break, the afternoon consists of more exercise and work before the crew carries out its pre-sleep activities beginning at 19:30, including dinner and a crew conference. The scheduled sleep period begins at 21:30. In general, the crew works ten hours per day on a weekday, and five hours on Saturdays, with the rest of the time their own for relaxation or work catch-up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/287386main_110508_tl.pdf |title=ISS Crew Timeline |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=5 November 2008 |publisher=NASA |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\nThe time zone used aboard the ISS is [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

From an average distance of about {{convert|70,000|km|abbr=on}}, depending on Solar activity, the [[magnetosphere]] begins to deflect [[solar wind]] around Earth and ISS. [[coronal mass ejection|Solar flares]] are still a hazard to the crew, who may receive only a few minutes warning. In 2005, during the initial 'proton storm' of an X-3 class solar flare, the crew of [[Expedition 10]] took shelter in a more heavily shielded part of the [[Russian Orbital Segment|ROS]] designed for this purpose.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solar Flare Hits Earth and Mars |author=Ker Than |publisher=Space.com |date=23 February 2006 |url=http://www.space.com/2080-solar-flare-hits-earth-mars.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new kind of solar storm |publisher=NASA |date=10 June 2005 |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2005/10jun_newstorm/}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Aurora Australis.ogv|thumb|left|Video of the [[Aurora Australis]] taken by the crew of [[Expedition 28]] on an ascending pass from south of [[Madagascar]] to just north of Australia over the Indian Ocean.]]\n\nSubatomic charged particles, primarily [[proton]]s from [[cosmic ray]]s and solar wind, are normally absorbed by Earth's atmosphere. When they interact in sufficient quantity, their effect is visible to the naked eye in a phenomenon called an [[aurora]]. Outside Earth's atmosphere, crews are exposed to about 1 [[millisievert]] each day, which is about a year of natural exposure on Earth. This results in a higher risk of cancer for astronauts. Radiation can penetrate living tissue and damage the [[DNA]] and [[chromosome]]s of [[lymphocytes]]. These cells are central to the [[immune system]], and so any damage to them could contribute to the lower [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] experienced by astronauts. Radiation has also been linked to a higher incidence of [[cataract]]s in astronauts. Protective shielding and drugs may lower risks to an acceptable level.<ref name=\"JCB\"/>\n\nRadiation levels on the ISS are about five times greater than those experienced by airline passengers and crew. Earth's electromagnetic field provides almost the same level of protection against solar and other radiation in low Earth orbit as in the stratosphere. For example, on a 12-hour flight an airline passenger would experience 0.1 millisieverts of radiation, or a rate of 0.2 millisieverts per day; only 1/5 the rate experienced by an astronaut in LEO. Additionally, airline passengers experience this level of radiation for a few hours of flight, while ISS crew are exposed for their whole stay.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov./cariprofile.asp |title=Galactic Radiation Received in Flight |accessdate=20 May 2010 |publisher=FAA Civil Aeromedical Institute |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329130826/http://jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp |archivedate=29 March 2010}}</ref>\n{{See also|Coronal mass ejection|Aurora (astronomy)}}\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Nikolai Budarin in a sleep station in Zvezda.jpg|thumb|Cosmonaut [[Nikolai Budarin]] at work inside ''[[Zvezda (ISS module)|Zvezda]]'' service module crew quarters]]\nThere is considerable evidence that [[psychosocial]] stressors are among the most important impediments to optimal crew morale and performance.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter Suedfeld1 |author2=Kasia E.

Common sources of stress in early American missions included maintaining high performance under public scrutiny and isolation from peers and family. The latter is still often a cause of stress on the ISS, such as when the mother of NASA Astronaut [[Daniel M.

Crew members with a military pilot background and those with an academic science background or teachers and politicians may have problems understanding each other's jargon and worldview.\n\nDue to the lack of gravity, confusion often occurs. Even though there is no up and down in space, some crew members feel like they are oriented upside down. They may also have difficulty measuring distances. This can cause problems like getting lost inside the space station, pulling switches in the wrong direction or misjudging the speed of an approaching vehicle during docking.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141007-why-astronauts-get-space-stupid BBC - Future - Why astronauts get the 'space stupids']</ref>\n\n===Medical===\n[[File:Frank De Winne on treadmill cropped.jpg|thumb|Astronaut [[Frank De Winne]] is attached to the [[Treadmill with Vibration Isolation System|TVIS treadmill]] with bungee cords aboard the International Space Station|alt=Astronaut Frank De Winne is attached to the TVIS treadmill with bungee cords aboard the International Space Station]]\nMedical effects of long-term weightlessness include [[muscle atrophy]], deterioration of the skeleton [[spaceflight osteopenia|(osteopenia)]], fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening of the immune system.

The stories were originally published between 1964 and 1965 in the Italian periodicals ''Il Caff\u00e8'' and [[Il Giorno (newspaper)|''Il Giorno'']]. Each story takes a scientific \"fact\" (though sometimes a falsehood by today's understanding), and builds an imaginative story around it.  An always-extant being called [[Qfwfq]] narrates all of the stories save two, each of which is a memory of an event in the history of the universe. Qfwfq also narrates some stories in Calvino's ''[[t zero]]''.\n\nAll of the stories in ''Cosmicomics'', together with those from ''t zero'' and other sources, are now available in a single volume collection, ''[[The Complete Cosmicomics]]'' (Penguin UK, 2009).\n\nThe first U.S. edition, translated by [[William Weaver]], won the [[National Book Award]] in the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Translation|Translation category]].<ref name=nba1969>\n[http://www.nationalbook.org/nba1969.html \"National Book Awards \u2013 1969\"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-11.<br/>There was a \"Translation\" award from 1967 to 1983.</ref>\n\n==Contents==\n\n*''The Distance of the Moon'', the first and probably the best known story. Calvino takes the fact that the Moon [[Tidal acceleration|used to be much closer]] to the Earth, and builds a story about a love triangle among people who used to jump between the Earth and the Moon, in which lovers drift apart as the Moon recedes.\n*''At Daybreak'' \u2014 Life before matter condenses.\n*''A Sign in Space'' \u2014 The idea that the galaxy slowly revolves becomes a story about a being who is desperate to leave behind some unique sign of his existence.  This story also is a direct illustration of one of the tenets of [[postmodernism|postmodern theory]] \u2014 that the sign is not the thing it signifies, nor can one claim to fully or properly describe a thing or an idea with a word or other symbol.\n*''All at One Point'' \u2014 The fact that all matter and creation used to exist in a single point.  \"Naturally, we were all there\u2014old Qfwfq said\u2014where else could we have been? Nobody knew then that there could be space. Or time either: what use did we have for time, packed in there like sardines?\"\n*''Without Colors'' \u2014 Before there was an atmosphere, everything was the same shade of gray. As the atmosphere appears, so do colors. The novelty scares off Ayl, Qfwfq's love interest.\n*''Games Without End'' \u2014 A galactic game of marbles back before the universe had formed much more than particles.\n*''The Aquatic Uncle'' \u2014 A tale on the fact that at one stage in evolution animals left the sea and came to live on land.  The story is about a family living on land that is a bit ashamed of their old uncle who still lives in the sea, refusing to come ashore like \"civilized\" people.\n*''How Much Shall We Bet'' \u2014 A story about betting on the long term evolution of mankind.\n*''The Dinosaurs'' \u2014 How some dinosaurs lived after most of them had become extinct, and how it felt to be that last existing dinosaur in an age where all the current mammals feared his kind as demons.\n*''The Form of Space'' \u2014 As the unnamed narrator \"falls\" through space, he cannot help but notice that his trajectory is parallel to that of a beautiful woman, Ursula H'x, and that of lieutenant Fenimore, who is also in love with Ursula. The narrator dreams of the shape of space changing, so that he may touch Ursula (or fight with Fenimore).\n*''The Light Years'' \u2014 The unnamed narrator looking at other galaxies, and spotting one with a sign pointed right at him saying \"I saw you.\"  Given that there's a gulf of 100,000,000 light years, he checks his diary to find out what he had been doing that day, and finds out that it was something he wished to hide.  Then he starts to worry.\n*''The Spiral'' \u2014 A story about life as a mollusc, and the nature of love and writing.\n\nAll of the stories feature non-human characters which have been heavily [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book | last=Tuck | first=Donald H. | authorlink=Donald H.

In some other contexts, certain iterations of the IA-32 ISA are sometimes labelled '''i486, i586''' and '''i686,''' referring to the instruction [[Superset|supersets]] offered by the [[Intel 80486|80486]], the [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] and the [[P6 (microarchitecture)|P6 microarchitectures]] respectively. These updates offered numerous additions alongside the base IA-32 set, i.e. [[X87|floating-point capabilities]] and the [[MMX (instruction set)|MMX extensions]].\n\nIntel was historically the largest manufacturer of IA-32 processors, with the second biggest supplier having been [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]. During the 1990s, [[VIA Technologies|VIA]], [[Transmeta]] and other chip manufacturers also produced IA-32 compatible processors (e.g. [[WinChip]]). In the modern era, Intel still produces IA-32 processors under the [[Intel Quark]] [[microcontroller]] platform, however, since the 2000s, the majority of manufacturers (Intel included) moved almost exclusively to implementing CPUs based on the 64-bit variant of x86, [[x86-64]]. x86-64, by specification, offers legacy operating modes that operate on the IA-32 ISA for backwards compatibility. Even given the contemporary prevalence of x86-64, as of 2018, IA-32 protected mode versions of many modern operating systems are still maintained, e.g. [[Microsoft Windows]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#primaryR2|title=Windows 10 System Requirements & Specifications {{!}} Microsoft|website=www.microsoft.com|language=en-us|access-date=August 20, 2018}}</ref> and the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu Linux]] distribution.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ubuntu.com/download/alternative-downloads|title=Alternative downloads {{!}} Ubuntu|last=Canonical|website=www.ubuntu.com|language=en|access-date=August 20, 2018}}</ref> In spite of IA-32's name (and causing some potential confusion), the 64-bit evolution of x86 that originated out of AMD would not be known as \"IA-64\";{{refn|group=nb|Some of the more obscure names for x86-64 include \"IA-64''t''\" and \"IA-32''e''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superuser.com/questions/179919/x86-vs-x64-why-is-32-bit-called-x86#comment181908_179921|title=x86 vs x64 - Why is 32-bit called x86?|website=Super User|access-date=August 20, 2018}}</ref>}} that name instead belonging to [[IA-64|Intel's Itanium architecture]].\n\n== Architectural features ==\nThe primary defining characteristic of IA-32 is the availability of 32-bit general-purpose [[processor register]]s (for example, EAX and EBX), 32-bit [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] arithmetic and logical operations, 32-bit offsets within a segment in [[protected mode]], and the translation of segmented addresses to 32-bit linear addresses. The designers took the opportunity to make other improvements as well. Some of the most significant changes are described below.\n\n; 32-bit integer capability\n: All [[general-purpose register]]s (GPRs) are expanded from 16&nbsp;[[bit]]s to 32&nbsp;bits, and all arithmetic and logical operations, memory-to-register and register-to-memory operations, etc., can operate directly on 32-bit integers. [[Stack (data structure)|Pushes and pops]] on the [[Stack register|stack]] default to 4-byte strides, and non-segmented [[pointer (computer programming)|pointers]] are 4 bytes wide.\n; More general addressing modes\n: Any GPR can be used as a base register, and any GPR other than ESP can be used as an index register, in a memory reference.  The index register value can be multiplied by 1, 2, 4, or 8 before being added to the base register value and displacement.\n; Additional segment registers\n: Two additional segment registers, FS and GS, are provided.\n; Larger virtual address space\n: The IA-32 architecture defines a 48-bit segmented address format, with a 16-bit segment number and a 32-bit offset within the segment.  Segmented addresses are mapped to 32-bit linear addresses.\n; Demand paging\n: 32-bit linear addresses are virtual addresses rather than physical addresses; they are translated to physical addresses through a [[page table]].

These include human motivation, knowledge, justification, meaning, and truth. The distinction arises in many areas of debate with similar but distinct meanings.\n\nInternalism is the thesis that no fact about the world can provide reasons for action independently of desires and beliefs.<ref name=\"D'Oro\">Giuseppina D'Oro, [https://www.academia.edu/241389/Collingwood_Psychologism_and_Internalism \"Collingwood, psychologism and internalism,\"] ''European Journal of Philosophy'' '''12'''(2):163\u2013177 (2004).</ref> Externalism is the thesis that reasons are to be identified with objective features of the world.<ref name=\"D'Oro\" />\n\n== Moral philosophy ==\n\n=== Motivation ===\n\nIn contemporary moral philosophy, '''motivational internalism''' (or '''moral internalism''') is the view that moral convictions (which are not necessarily beliefs, e.g. feelings of moral approval or disapproval) are intrinsically motivating. That is, the motivational internalist believes that there is an internal, necessary connection between one's conviction that X ought to be done and one's motivation to do X. Conversely, the '''motivational externalist''' (or '''moral externalist''') claims that there is no necessary internal connection between moral convictions and moral motives.<ref name=\"Williams\" >Williams, Bernard (1981) \"Internal and External Reasons\", in Williams's ''Moral Luck'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, pp.&nbsp;101\u201313.</ref> That is, there is no necessary connection between the conviction that X is wrong and the motivational drive not to do X. (The use of these terms has roots in W.D. Falk's (1947) paper \"'Ought' and Motivation\"<ref>Falk, W. D. (1947) \"'Ought' and Motivation\", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 48: 492\u2013510</ref>).\n\nThese views in [[moral psychology]] have various implications. In particular, if motivational internalism is true, then an [[amoralist]] is unintelligible (and metaphysically impossible). An amoralist is not simply someone who is immoral, rather it is someone who knows what the moral things to do are, yet is not motivated to do them. Such an agent is unintelligible to the motivational internalist, because moral judgments about the right thing to do have built into them corresponding motivations to do those things that are judged by the agent to be the moral things to do. On the other hand, an amoralist is entirely intelligible to the motivational ''externalist'', because the motivational externalist thinks that moral judgments about the right thing to do not necessitate some motivation to do those things that are judged to be the right thing to do; rather, an independent desire\u2014such as the desire to do the right thing\u2014is required (Brink, 2003<ref>Brink, David (1989) \"Moral Realism and the Foundations of Ethics\", New York: Cambridge University Press, Ch. 3, pp. 37\u201380.</ref>), (Rosati, 2006<ref>Rosati, Connie S. (2006). \"Moral Motivation\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Edward N. Zalta (ed.).</ref>).\n\n=== Reasons ===\nThere is also a distinction in [[ethics]] and [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]], largely made popular by [[Bernard Williams]] (1979, reprinted in 1981),<ref name=\"Williams\" /> concerning internal and external reasons for action.  An ''internal reason'' is, roughly, something that one has in light of one's own \"subjective motivational set\"---one's own commitments, desires (or wants), goals, etc. On the other hand, an ''external reason'' is something that one has independent of one's subjective motivational set.  For example, suppose that Sally is going to drink a glass of poison, because she wants to commit suicide and believes that she can do so by drinking the poison.  Sally has an internal reason to drink the poison, because she wants to commit suicide.  However, one might say that she has an external reason not to drink the poison because, even though she wants to die, one ought not kill oneself no matter what\u2014regardless of whether one wants to die.\n\nSome philosophers embrace the existence of both kinds of reason, while others deny the existence of one or the other. For example, Bernard Williams (1981)<ref name=\"Williams\" /> argues that there are really only internal reasons for action. Such a view is called ''internalism about reasons'' (or ''reasons internalism''). ''Externalism about reasons'' (or ''reasons externalism'') is the denial of reasons internalism.<ref>Finlay, Stephen & Schroeder, Mark (2008). \"Reasons for Action: Internal vs. External\" (\u00a71.1). The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Edward N. Zalta (ed.))</ref> It is the view that there are external reasons for action; that is, there are reasons for action that one can have even if the action is not part of one's subjective motivational set.\n\nConsider the following situation. Suppose that it's against the moral law to steal from the poor, and Sasha knows this. However, Sasha doesn't desire to follow the moral law, and there is currently a poor person next to him. Is it intelligible to say that Sasha has a reason to follow the moral law right now (to not steal from the poor person next to him), even though he doesn't care to do so? The reasons externalist answers in the affirmative (\"Yes, Sasha has a reason not to steal from that poor person.\"), since he believes that one can have reasons for action even if one does not have the relevant desire. Conversely, the reasons internalist answers the question in the negative (\"No, Sasha does not have a reason not to steal from that poor person, though others might.\"). The reasons internalist claims that external reasons are unintelligible; one has a reason for action only if one has the relevant desire (that is, only internal reasons can be reasons for action). The reasons internalist claims the following: the moral facts are a reason ''for Sasha's action'' not to steal from the poor person next to him only if he currently ''wants'' to follow the moral law (or if not stealing from the poor person is a way to satisfy his other current goals\u2014that is, part of what Williams calls his \"subjective motivational set\"). In short, the reasoning behind reasons internalism, according to Williams,<ref name=\"Williams\" /> is that reasons for action must be able to explain one's action; and only internal reasons can do this.\n\n== Epistemology<!--Linked from 'Reliabilism'--> ==\n\n=== Justification ===\n\n==== Internalism ====\nGenerally speaking, internalist conceptions of epistemic justification require that one\u2019s justification for a belief be internal to the believer in some way. Two main varieties of epistemic internalism about justification are access internalism and ontological internalism. Access internalists require that a believer must have internal access to the justifier(s) of her belief ''p'' in order to be justified in believing ''p''. For the access internalist, justification amounts to something like the believer being aware (or capable of being aware) of certain facts that make her belief in ''p'' rational, or her being able to give reasons for her belief in ''p''. At minimum, access internalism requires that the believer have some kind of reflective access or awareness to whatever justifies her belief. Ontological internalism is the view that justification for a belief is established by one\u2019s mental states. Ontological internalism can be distinct from access internalism, but the two are often thought to go together since we are generally considered to be capable of having reflective access to mental states.<ref name=\"Sosa, Ernest 2008\">Sosa, Ernest, Jaegwon Kim, Jeremy Fantl, Matthew McGrath. Introduction to Part V. ''Epistemology.'' By Ernest Sosa, Jaegwon Kim, Jeremy Fantl, Matthew McGrath. Malden: Blackwell, 2008. 305-309. Print.</ref>\n\nOne popular argument for internalism is known as the 'new evil demon problem'. The new evil demon problem indirectly supports internalism by challenging externalist views of justification, particularly [[reliabilism]]. The argument asks us to imagine a subject with beliefs and experiences identical to ours, but the subject is being systematically deceived by a malicious Cartesian demon so that all their beliefs turn out false. In spite of the subject's unfortunate deception, the argument goes, we do not think this subject ceases to be rational in taking things to be as they appear as we do. After all, it is possible that we could be radically deceived in the same way, yet we are still justified in holding most of our beliefs in spite of this possibility. Since reliabilism maintains that one's beliefs are justified via reliable belief-forming processes (where reliable means yielding true beliefs), the subject in the evil demon scenario would not likely have any justified beliefs according to reliabilism because all of their beliefs would be false. Since this result is supposed to clash with our intuitions that the subject is justified in their beliefs in spite of being systematically deceived, some take the new evil demon problem as a reason for rejecting externalist views of justification.<ref>\"The New Evil Demon Problem\" by Clayton Littlejohn, ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', {{ISSN|2161-0002}}, <nowiki>http://www.iep.utm.edu/</nowiki>, today's date</ref>\n\n==== Externalism ====\nExternalist views of justification emerged in epistemology during the late 20th century. Externalist conceptions of justification assert that facts external to the believer can serve as the justification for a belief. According to the externalist, a believer need not have any internal access or cognitive grasp of any reasons or facts which make her belief justified.<ref>BonJour, Laurence. \u201cExternalist Theories of Empirical Knowledge.\u201d ''Epistemology.'' Ed. Ernest Sosa, Jaegwon Kim, Jeremy Fantl, Matthew McGrath. Malden: Blackwell, 2008. 365. Print.</ref> The externalist\u2019s assessment of justification can be contrasted with access internalism, which demands that the believer have internal reflective access to reasons or facts which corroborate their belief in order to be justified in holding it. Externalism, on the other hand, maintains that the justification for someone\u2019s belief can come from facts that are entirely external to the agent\u2019s subjective awareness.<ref name=\"Sosa, Ernest 2008\"/>\n\n[[Alvin Goldman]], one of the most well-known proponents of externalism in epistemology, is known for developing a popular form of externalism called [[reliabilism]]. In his paper, \u201cWhat is Justified Belief?\u201d Goldman characterizes the reliabilist conception of justification as such:\n\n\"If S\u2019s believing ''p'' at ''t'' results from a reliable cognitive belief-forming process (or \tset of processes), then S\u2019s belief in ''p'' at ''t'' is justified.<ref name=\":0\">Goldman, Alvin I. \u201cWhat is Justified Belief?\u201d ''Epistemology.'' Ed. Ernest Sosa, Jaegwon Kim, Jeremy Fantl, Matthew McGrath. Malden: Blackwell, 2008. 333-347. Print</ref>\u201d\n\nGoldman notes that a reliable belief-forming process is one which generally produces true beliefs.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nA unique consequence of reliabilism (and other forms of externalism) is that one can have a justified belief without knowing one is justified (this is not possible under most forms of epistemic internalism). In addition, we do not yet know which cognitive processes are in fact reliable, so anyone who embraces reliabilism must concede that we do not always know whether some of our beliefs are justified (even though there is a fact of the matter).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== As a response to skepticism<!--Linked from 'Semantic externalism'--> ===\nIn responding to [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]], [[Hilary Putnam]] (1982<ref name=\"Putnam, H. 1981\">Putnam, H. (1981): \"Brains in a vat\" in Reason, Truth, and History, Cambridge University Press; reprinted in DeRose and Warfield, editors (1999): Skepticism: A Contemporary Reader, Oxford UP.</ref>) claims that [[semantic externalism]] yields \"an argument we can give that shows we are not [[brain in a vat|brains in a vat]] (BIV).  (See also DeRose, 1999.<ref name=\"DeRose\">DeRose, Keith (1999) \"Responding to Skepticism\", Skepticism: A Contemporary Reader.</ref>) If semantic externalism is true, then the meaning of a word or sentence is not wholly determined by what individuals think those words mean.  For example, semantic externalists maintain that the word \"water\" referred to the substance whose chemical composition is H<sub>2</sub>O even before scientists had discovered that chemical composition.  The fact that the substance out in the world we were calling \"water\" actually had that composition at least partially determined the meaning of the word.  One way to use this in a response to skepticism is to apply the same strategy to the terms used in a skeptical argument in the following way (DeRose, 1999<ref name=\"DeRose\" />):\n\n{{quote|Either I am a BIV, or I am not a BIV.<br/>\nIf I am not a BIV, then when I say \"I am not a BIV\", it is true.<br/>\nIf I am a BIV, then, when I say \"I am not a BIV\", it is true (because \"brain\" and \"vat\" would only pick out the brains and vats being simulated, not real brains and real vats).<br/>\n---<br/>\nMy utterance of \"I am not a BIV\" is true.}}\n\nTo clarify how this argument is supposed to work:  Imagine that there is brain in a vat, and a whole world is being simulated for it.  Call the individual who is being deceived \"Steve.\"  When Steve is given an experience of walking through a park, semantic externalism allows for his thought, \"I am walking through a park\" to be true so long as the [[simulated reality]] is one in which he is walking through a park.  Similarly, what it takes for his thought, \"I am a brain in a vat,\" to be true is for the simulated reality to be one where he is a brain in a vat.  But in the simulated reality, he is not a brain in a vat.\n\nApart from disputes over the success of the argument or the plausibility of the specific type of semantic externalism required for it to work, there is question as to what is gained by defeating the skeptical worry with this strategy.  Skeptics can give new skeptical cases that wouldn't be subject to the same response (e.g., one where the person was very recently turned into a brain in a vat, so that their words \"brain\" and \"vat\" still pick out real brains and vats, rather than simulated ones).  Further, if even brains in vats can correctly believe \"I am not a brain in a vat,\" then the skeptic can still press us on how we know we are not in that situation (though the externalist will point out that it may be difficult for the skeptic to describe that situation).\n\nAnother attempt to use externalism to refute skepticism is done by [[Anthony Brueckner|Brueckner]]<ref>{{citation\n | first = Anthony\n | last = Brueckner\n | title = Semantic Answers to Skepticism\n | booktitle = Skepticism: A Contemporary Reader\n | pages = 43\u201360\n | publisher = Oxford University Press\n | year = 1999\n | location = Oxford\n}}</ref> and [[Ted A. Warfield|Warfield]].<ref>Warfield, Ted A. Skepticism (1999, ed. with Keith DeRose, Oxford, 1999)</ref> It involves the claim that our thoughts are ''[[intentionality|about]]'' things, unlike a BIV's thoughts, which cannot be ''about'' things (DeRose, 1999<ref name=\"DeRose\"/>).\n\n== Semantics ==\n\n[[Semantic externalism]] comes in two varieties, depending on whether meaning is construed cognitively or linguistically. On a cognitive construal, externalism is the thesis that what concepts (or contents) are available to a thinker is determined by their environment, or their relation to their environment. On a linguistic construal, externalism is the thesis that the meaning of a word is environmentally determined. Likewise, one can construe semantic internalism in two ways, as a denial of either of these two theses.\n\nExternalism and internalism in semantics is closely tied to the distinction in [[philosophy of mind]] concerning mental content, since the contents of one's thoughts (specifically, [[intentional mental state]]s) are usually taken to be semantic objects that are truth-evaluable.\n\nSee also:\n*[[Linguistic turn]] and [[cognitive turn]] for more about the two construals of meaning\n*[[Swamp man]] thought experiment\n*[[Twin Earth thought experiment]]\n\n== Philosophy of mind ==\n\nWithin the context of the philosophy of mind, [[externalism]] is the theory that the contents of at least some of one's mental states are dependent in part on their relationship to the external world or one's environment.\n\nThe traditional discussion on externalism was centered around the semantic aspect of mental content. This is by no means the only meaning of externalism now. Externalism is now a broad collection of philosophical views considering all aspects of mental content and activity. There are various forms of externalism that consider either the content or the vehicles of the mind or both. Furthermore, externalism could be limited to cognition, or it could address broader issues of consciousness.\n\nAs to the traditional discussion on semantic externalism (often dubbed ''content externalism''), some mental states, such as believing that water is wet, and fearing that the Queen has been insulted, have contents we can capture using 'that' clauses.  The content externalist often appeal to observations found as early as [[Hilary Putnam]]'s seminal essay, \"The Meaning of 'Meaning',\" (1975).<ref name=\"Putnam, H. 1981\"/> Putnam stated that we can easily imagine pairs of individuals that are microphysical duplicates embedded in different surroundings who use the same words but mean different things when using them.\n\nFor example, suppose that Ike and Tina's mothers are identical twins and that Ike and Tina are raised in isolation from one another in indistinguishable environments.  When Ike says, \"I want my mommy,\" he expresses a want satisfied only if he is brought to his mommy.  If we brought Tina's mommy, Ike might not notice the difference, but he doesn't get what he wants.  It seems that what he wants and what he says when he says, \"I want my mommy,\" will be different from what Tina wants and what she says she wants when she says, \"I want my mommy.\"\n\nExternalists say that if we assume competent speakers know what they think, and say what they think, the difference in what these two speakers mean corresponds to a difference in the thoughts of the two speakers that is not (necessarily) reflected by a difference in the internal make up of the speakers or thinkers.  They urge us to move from externalism about meaning of the sort Putnam defended to externalism about contentful states of mind.  The example pertains to singular terms, but has been extended to cover kind terms as well such as [[natural kind]]s (e.g., 'water') and for kinds of artifacts (e.g., 'espresso maker').  There is no general agreement amongst content externalists as to the scope of the thesis.\n\nPhilosophers now tend to distinguish between ''wide content'' (externalist mental content) and ''narrow content'' (anti-externalist mental content).  Some, then, align themselves as endorsing one view of content exclusively, or both.  For example, [[Jerry Fodor]] (1980<ref>Fodor, Jerry (1980) \"Methodological Solipsism Considered as a Research Strategy in Cognitive Psychology\", Behavioral and Brain Sciences 3:1.</ref>) argues for narrow content (although he comes to reject that view in his 1995), while [[David Chalmers]] (2002)<ref>Chalmers, David (2002) \"The Components of Content\", in Chalmers (ed.) Philosophy of Mind: Classical and Contemporary Readings, Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref> argues for a [[two dimensional semantics]] according to which the contents of mental states can have both wide and narrow content.\n\nCritics of the view have questioned the original thought experiments saying that the lessons that Putnam and later writers such as [[Tyler Burge]] (1979,<ref>Burge, Tyler (1979) \"Individualism and the Mental\", in French, Uehling, and Wettstein (eds.) Midwest Studies in Philosophy IV, Minneapolis: [[University of Minnesota Press]], pp. 73\u2013121.</ref> 1982<ref>Burge, Tyler (1982) \"Other Bodies\", in Woodfield, Andrew, ed., Thought and Object. New York: Oxford.</ref>) have urged us to draw can be resisted.  [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] and [[John Searle]], for example, have defended internalist accounts of thought content according to which the contents of our thoughts are fixed by descriptions that pick out the individuals and kinds that our thoughts intuitively pertain to the sorts of things that we take them to.  In the Ike/Tina example, one might agree that Ike's thoughts pertain to Ike's mother and that Tina's thoughts pertain to Tina's but insist that this is because Ike thinks of that woman as his mother and we can capture this by saying that he thinks of her as 'the mother of the speaker'.  This descriptive phrase will pick out one unique woman.  Externalists claim this is implausible, as we would have to ascribe to Ike knowledge he wouldn't need to successfully think about or refer to his mother.\n\nCritics have also claimed that content externalists are committed to epistemological absurdities. Suppose that a speaker can have the concept of water we do only if the speaker lives in a world that contains H<sub>2</sub>O.  It seems this speaker could know a priori that she thinks that water is wet. This is the thesis of privileged access.  It also seems that she could know on the basis of simple thought experiments that she can only think that water is wet if she lives in a world that contains water. What would prevent her from putting these together and coming to know a priori that the world contains water? If we should say that no one could possibly know whether water exists a priori, it seems either we cannot know content externalism to be true on the basis of thought experiments or we cannot know what we are thinking without first looking into the world to see what it is like.\n\nAs mentioned, content externalism (limited to the semantic aspects) is only one among many other options offered by externalism by and large.\n\nSee also:\n* [[Twin Earth thought experiment]]\n* [[Extended cognition]]\n\n== Historiography of science<!--'Historiographical internalism' and 'Historiographical externalism' redirect here--> ==\n{{also|Rational reconstruction}}\n'''Internalism in the [[historiography of science]]'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> claims that science is completely distinct from [[social influence]]s and pure natural science can exist in any society and at any time given the intellectual capacity.<ref name=Guide>Arne Hessenbruch (ed.), ''Reader's Guide to the History of Science'', Routledge, 2013: \"Internalism versus Externalism\".</ref> [[Imre Lakatos]] is a notable proponent of historiographical internalism.<ref>Kostas Gavroglu, Yorgos Goudaroulis, P.

There may also be a perceived benefit from avoiding international trade agreements or other mutual assistance pacts.<ref>(Sullivan, Michael P., \"Isolationism.\" World Book Deluxe 2001.

His son, [[Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck]], was elected as Druk Gyalpo of Bhutan, which helped forge the [[Bhutanese democracy]].  Subsequently, [[Bhutan]] has transitioned from an [[absolute monarchy]] to a [[multi-party system|multi-party]] [[democracy]]. The development of ''Bhutanese democracy'' has been marked by the active encouragement and participation of reigning [[Druk Gyalpo|Bhutanese monarchs]] since the 1950s, beginning with legal reforms such as the [[slavery in Bhutan|abolition of slavery]], and culminating in the enactment of [[Constitution of Bhutan|Bhutan's Constitution]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/bhutan/ci_15906144 |title=Reporter's Notebook from Bhutan: Crashing the Lost Horizon |first=Matt |last=O'Brien |publisher=Contra Costa Times |date=2010-08-29 |accessdate=2011-09-18}}</ref>\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Haijin}}\nAfter [[Ming treasure voyages|Zheng He's voyages]] in the 15th century, the foreign policy of the [[Ming dynasty]] in [[China]] became increasingly isolationist. The [[Hongwu Emperor]] was the first to propose the policy to ban all maritime shipping in 1371.<ref>Vo Glahn, Richard. [1996] (1996).

[[Wokou]], which literally translates to \"Japanese pirates\" or \"dwarf pirates\", were pirates who raided the coastlines of China, Japan, and Korea, and were one of the key primary concerns, although the maritime ban was not without some control.\n\n===Japan===\n{{Main|Sakoku}}\nFrom 1641 to 1853, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] of [[Japan]] enforced a policy which it called ''kaikin''. The policy prohibited foreign contact with most outside countries. However, the commonly held idea that Japan was entirely closed is misleading. In fact, Japan maintained limited-scale trade and diplomatic relations with [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom|Ryukyu Islands]] <ref>Ronald P.

During this period, Japan developed thriving cities, castle towns, increasing commodification of agriculture and domestic trade,<ref>Thomas C.

His father, Regent [[Heungseon Daewongun]], ruled for him until Gojong reached adulthood. During the mid-1860s he was the main proponent of isolationism and the principal instrument of the persecution of both native and foreign Catholics.\n\nFollowing the [[division of Korea|division]] of the peninsula after independence from [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] in 1945\u201348, [[Kim il-Sung]] inaugurated an isolationist [[Juche|totalitarian regime]] in the [[North Korea|North]], which has been continued by his son and grandson to the present day. North Korea is often referred to as \"The [[Hermit Kingdom]]\".\n\n===Paraguay===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2014}}\nJust after independence was achieved, [[Paraguay]] was governed from 1814 by the [[dictator]] [[Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia]], who closed the country's borders and prohibited trade or any relation with the outside world until his death in 1840. The [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers who had arrived just before independence had to intermarry with either the old colonists or with the native [[Guarani people|Guarani]], in order to create a single Paraguayan people.\n\nFrancia had a particular dislike of foreigners and any who came to Paraguay during his rule (which would have been very difficult) were not allowed to leave for the rest of their lives. An independent character, he hated European influences and the [[Catholic Church]], turning church courtyards into artillery parks and confession boxes into border sentry posts, in an attempt to keep foreigners at bay.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|United States non-interventionism#Non-interventionism before entering World War II}}\nWhile some scholars, such as [[Robert J.

A desire for separateness and unilateral freedom of action merged with national pride and a sense of continental safety to foster the policy of isolation. Although the United States maintained diplomatic relations and economic contacts abroad, it sought to restrict these as narrowly as possible in order to retain its independence. The Department of State continually rejected proposals for joint cooperation, a policy made explicit in the Monroe Doctrine's emphasis on unilateral action. Not until 1863 did an American delegate attend an international conference.<ref>{{cite web|title=Internationalism|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Internationalism.aspx|website=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=15 August 2016}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Autarky]]\n*[[Civil society]]\n*[[Country neutrality (international relations)|Country neutrality]]\n*[[Economic nationalism]]\n*[[Global issue]]\n*[[Globalism]]\n*[[Globalization]]\n*[[Imperium]]\n*[[Interconnectivity]]\n*[[International isolation]]\n*[[Monroe Doctrine]]\n*[[Non-interventionism]]\n*[[Sakoku]]\n*[[Splendid isolation]]\n*[[United States non-interventionism]]\n*[[Unilateralism in the United States]]\n*[[Sovereignty]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Works cited==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Barry, Tom.

This new Colts team, now in the \"big league\" of [[American football|professional American football]] for the first time, although with shaky financing and ownership,  played only in the 1950 season of the reorganized \"third\" NFL, and was later disbanded and moved.\n\nTwo years later, in 1953, a new [[Baltimore]]-based group, heavily supported by the City's municipal government and with a large subscription-base of fan-purchased season tickets, led by local owner [[Carroll Rosenbloom]] won the rights to a new Baltimore NFL franchise.<ref>{{cite web|title=History Highlights|url=http://www.colts.com/team/history.html|publisher=Indianapolis Colts|accessdate=August 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Baltimore Colts History\">{{cite web|title=Baltimore Colts: Historical Moments|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/balticolts/baltcolts.html|publisher=Sports Encyclopedia|accessdate=July 5, 2012}}</ref> Rosenbloom was awarded the remains of the former [[Dallas Texans (NFL)|Dallas Texans]] team, who themselves had a long and winding history starting as the [[Boston Yanks]] in 1944, merging later with the [[Brooklyn Tigers]], and who were previously known as the [[Dayton Triangles]], one of the original old NFL teams established even before the League itself, in 1913. With the organization in 1920 of the original [[American Professional Football Association|\"American Professional Football Conference\" [APFC], (soon renamed the \"American Professional Football Association\"]], [APF.]), then two years later in 1922, renamed a second time, now permanently as the \"[[National Football League]]\".<ref name=\"Baltimore Colts History\"/> That team later became the [[New York Yanks]] in 1950, and many of the players from the [[New York Yankees (AAFC)|New York Yankees]] of the former competing [[All-America Football Conference]] (1946\u201349), were added to the team to begin playing in the newly merged League for the 1950 season. The Yanks then moved to [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] in [[Texas]] after the 1951 season having competed for two seasons, but played their final two \"home\" games of the 1952 season as a so-called \"road team\" at the [[Rubber Bowl]] football stadium in [[Akron, Ohio]].

In 1957 the horseshoes moved to their current location, one on each side of the helmet. The blue jerseys have white shoulder stripes and the white jerseys have blue stripes. The team also wears white pants with blue stripes down the sides.\n\nFrom 1982 through 1986, the Colts wore gray pants with their blue jerseys. The gray pants featured a horseshoe on the top of the sides with the player's number inside the horseshoe. The Colts continued to wear white pants with their white jerseys throughout this period, and in 1987, the gray pants were retired.\n\nThe Colts wore blue pants with their white jerseys for the first three games of the [[1995 NFL season|1995]] season, but then returned to white pants with both the blue and white jerseys. The team made some minor uniform adjustments before the start of the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]], including reverting from blue to the traditional gray face masks, darkening their blue colors from a royal blue to speed blue, as well as adding two white stripes to the socks. In 2006, the stripes were removed from the socks.\n\nIn 2002, the Colts made a minor striping pattern change on their jerseys, having the stripes only on top of the shoulders then stop completely. Previously, the stripes used to go around to underneath the jersey sleeves. This was done because the Colts, like many other football teams, were beginning to manufacture the jerseys to be tighter to reduce holding calls and reduce the size of the sleeves. Although the white jerseys of the [[Minnesota Vikings]] at the time also had a similar striping pattern and continued as such (as well as the [[Throwback uniform|throwbacks]] the [[New England Patriots]] wore in the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving game]] against the [[Detroit Lions]] in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], though the Patriots later wore the same throwbacks in [[2009 NFL season|2009]] with truncated stripes and in [[2010 NFL season|2010]] became their official [[Third jersey|alternate uniform]]), the Colts and most [[college football|college]] teams with this striping pattern did not make this adjustment.\n\n==Lucas Oil Stadium==\n{{Main|Lucas Oil Stadium}}\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | footer = Lucas Oil Stadium, home of the Indianapolis Colts.\n | footer_align = center\n | footer_background =\n | image1 = Lucas Oil Stadium - opening.JPG\n | width1 = 267\n | image2 = LucasOilStadiumTheLuke.jpg\n | width2 = 300\n}}\nAfter 24 years of playing at the RCA Dome, the Colts moved to their new home Lucas Oil Stadium in the fall of 2008.

In a deal estimated at $122 million, Lucas Oil Products won the naming rights to the stadium for 20 years.\n\nLucas Oil Stadium is a seven-level stadium which seats 63,000 for football.

The rivalry is fueled by the quarterback comparison between [[Peyton Manning]] and [[Tom Brady]]. The Patriots owned the beginning of the series, defeating the Colts in six consecutive contests including the 2003 AFC Championship game and a 2004 AFC Divisional game. The Colts won the next three matches, notching two regular season victories and a win in the 2006 AFC Championship game on the way to their win in [[Super Bowl XLI]]. On November 4, 2007 the Patriots defeated the Colts 24\u201320; in the next matchup on November 2, 2008, the Colts won 18\u201315 in a game that was one of the reasons the Patriots failed to make the playoffs; in the 2009 meeting, the Colts staged a spirited comeback to beat the Patriots 35\u201334; in [[2010 New England Patriots season|2010]] the Colts almost staged another comeback, pulling within 31\u201328 after trailing 31\u201314 in the fourth quarter, but fell short due to a Patriots interception of a Manning pass late in the game; it turned out to be Manning's final meeting against the Patriots as a member of the Colts.  After a [[2011 Indianapolis Colts season|dismal 2011 season]] that included a 31\u201324 loss to the Patriots, the Colts drafted [[Andrew Luck]] and in November of [[2012 Indianapolis Colts season|2012]] the two teams met with identical 6\u20133 records; the Patriots erased a 14\u20137 gap to win 59\u201324. The nature of this rivalry is ironic because the Colts and Patriots were division rivals from 1970 to 2001, but it did not become prominent in league circles until after Indianapolis was relocated to the [[AFC South]]. On November 16, 2014, the New England Patriots traveled at 7\u20132 to play the 6\u20133 Colts at Lucas Oil Stadium. After a stellar four touchdown performance by New England running back Jonas Gray, the Patriots defeated the Colts 42\u201320.  The Patriots followed up with a 45\u20137 defeat of the Colts in the 2014 [[AFC Championship Game]].\n\n===Earliest rivalries===\nIn the years 1953\u201366, the Colts played in the [[Eastern and Western Conferences (NFL) 1933\u201369|NFL Western Conference]] (also known as division), but did not have significant rivalries with other franchises in that alignment, as they were the eastern-most team and the rest of the division included the [[Great Lakes]] franchises [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]], [[Detroit Lions]], [[Chicago Bears]], and after 1961, the [[Minnesota Vikings]], along with the league's two West Coast teams in [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]]. The closest team to Baltimore was the [[Washington Redskins]], but they were not in the same division and not very competitive during most years at that time.\n\n===New York Giants===\nIn [[1958 NFL season|1958]], Baltimore played its first NFL Championship Game against the 10\u20133 [[New York Giants]]. The Giants qualified for the championship after a tie-breaking playoff against the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Having already been defeated by the Giants in the regular season, Baltimore was not favored to win, yet proceeded to [[1958 NFL Championship Game|take the title in sudden death overtime]]. The Colts then repeated the feat by posting an identical record and routing the Giants in the [[1959 NFL Championship Game|1959]] final. Up until the Colts' back-to-back titles, the Giants had been the premier club in the NFL, and continued to be post-season stalwarts the next decade, losing three straight finals. The situation was reversed by the end of the decade, with Baltimore winning the [[1968 NFL season|1968 NFL title]] and New York compiling less impressive results. In recent years, the Colts and Giants featured brothers as their starting quarterbacks ([[Peyton Manning|Peyton]] and [[Eli Manning]] respectively), leading to their occasional match-up being referred to as the \"[[Manning Bowl (American football)|Manning Bowl]]\".\n\n===New York Jets===\n[[Super Bowl III]] became the most famous upset in professional sports history as the [[American Football League]]'s [[1968 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] won 16\u20137 over the overwhelmingly favored Colts.  With the merger of the AFL and NFL the Colts and Jets were placed in the new [[AFC East]].  The two teams met twice a year (interrupted in 1982 by a player strike) 1970\u20132001; with the move of the Colts to the [[AFC South]] the two teams' rivalry actually escalated, as they met three times in the playoffs in the South's first nine seasons of existence; the Jets crushed the Colts 41\u20130 in the 2002 Wild Card playoff round; the Colts then defeated the Jets 30\u201317 in the 2009 [[AFC Championship Game]]; but the next year in the Wild Card round the Jets pulled off another playoff upset of the Colts, winning 17\u201316; it was [[Peyton Manning]]'s final game with the Colts.  The Jets defeated the Colts 35\u20139 in [[2012 Indianapolis Colts season|2012]] in [[Andrew Luck]]'s debut season; after two straight losses Luck led a 45\u201310 rout of the Jets in [[2016 Indianapolis Colts season|2016]].\n\n[[Joe Namath]] and [[Johnny Unitas]] were the focal point of the rivalry at its beginning, but they did not meet for a full game until September 24, 1972.  Namath erupted with six touchdowns and 496 passing yards despite only 28 throws and 15 completions.  Unitas threw for 376&nbsp;yards and two scores but was sacked six times as the Jets won 44\u201334; the game was considered one of the top ten passing duels in NFL history.<ref>{{YouTube|jDJdFsnOdNI|NFL Top 10 Quarterback Duels #4, Namath vs. Unitas}}</ref>\n\n===Miami Dolphins===\nBaltimore's post [[NFL-AFL merger]] passage to the AFC saw them thrust into a new environment with little in common with its fellow divisional teams: the [[New York Jets|Jets]], Miami Dolphins, [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Boston Patriots]]. One angle where the two clubs did have something in common, however, lay in new Miami coach [[Don Shula]].  Shula had coached the Colts the previous seven pre-merger seasons (1963\u20139) and was signed by [[Joe Robbie]] after the merger was consummated; because the signing came after the merger the NFL's rules on [[tampering (sport)|tampering]] came into play, and the Dolphins had to give up their first-round pick to the Colts.\n\nPowered by QB [[Earl Morrall]] Baltimore was the first non-AFL franchise to win a division title in the conference, outlasting the Miami Dolphins by one game, and leading the division since Week 3 of [[1970 NFL season|1970]]. The two franchises were denied a playoff confrontation by Miami's first-round defeat to the [[Oakland Raiders]], whereas Baltimore won its first Super Bowl title that year.\n\nYet in 1971, the teams were engaged in a heated race that went down to the final week of the season, where Miami won its first division title with a 10\u20133\u20131 title compared to the 10\u20134 Baltimore record after the Colts won the Week 13 matchup between them at home, but proceeded to lose the last game of the season to Boston. In the playoffs Baltimore advanced to the AFC title game after a 20\u20133 rout of the Cleveland Browns, whereas Miami survived a double-overtime nailbiter against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. This set up a title game that was favored for the defending league champion Colts. Yet Miami won the AFC championship with a 21\u20130 shutout and advanced to lose [[Super Bowl VI]] to Dallas. In 1975 Baltimore and Miami tied with 10\u20134 records, yet the Colts advanced to the playoffs based on a head-to-head sweep of their series. In 1977 Baltimore tied for first for the third straight year (in 1976 they tied with the now-New England Patriots) with Miami, and this time advanced to the playoffs on even slimmer pretenses, with a conference record of 9\u20133 compared to Miami's 8\u20134, as they had split the season series. The rivalry in the following years was virtually negated by very poor play of the Colts; the Colts won just 117 games in the twenty-one seasons (1978\u201398) that bracketed their 1977 playoff loss to the [[1977 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] and the 1999 trade of star running back [[Marshall Faulk]]; this included a 0\u20138\u20131 record during the NFL's strike shortened 1982 season.\n\nIn 1995, now as Indianapolis, the two both posted borderline 9\u20137 records to tie for second against [[1995 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo]], yet the Colts once again reached the post-season having swept the season series. The following season they edged out Miami by posting a 9\u20137 record and winning the ordinarily meaningless 3rd-place position, but qualifying for the wild card.  The two clubs' [[1999 Miami Dolphins season|1999]] [[1999 Indianapolis Colts season|meetings]] were dramatic affairs between [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall Of Fame-bound]] [[Dan Marino]] and up-and-coming star [[Peyton Manning]].  Marino led a 25-point fourth quarter comeback for a 34\u201331 Dolphins win at the [[RCA Dome]], and then in [[Joe Robbie Stadium|Miami]] Marino led another comeback to tie the game 34\u201334 with 36 seconds remaining; Manning, however, drove the Colts in range for a 53-yard field goal as time expired (37\u201334 Colts win).\n\nThe last truly meaningful matchup between the two franchises was in the 2000 season, when Miami edged out Indianapolis with an 11\u20135 record for the division championship. The two then met in the wild-card round where the Dolphins won 23\u201317 before [[2000 Oakland Raiders season|being blown out by Oakland 27\u20130]] (the Colts themselves had suffered a bitter loss to the Raiders in Week 2 of the season when the Raiders erased a 24\u20137 gap to win 38\u201331). In [[2002 Indianapolis Colts season|2002 the Colts]] moved to the newly created [[AFC South]] division; the two clubs met at the [[RCA Dome]] on September 15 where the Dolphins edged the Colts 21\u201313 after stopping a late Colts drive. The rivalry was effectively retired after this; the two clubs did meet in a memorable ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' matchup in 2009 where the Colts, despite having the ball for only 15 minutes, defeated the Dolphins 27\u201323.\n\nThe rivalry saw a rekindling after the [[2012 NFL Draft]] brought new quarterbacks to both teams in [[Ryan Tannehill]] and Luck. The two met during the 2012 season with Luck breaking the rookie record for passing yards in a game in a 23\u201320 win over the Dolphins, but Tannehill and the Dolphins beat the Colts 24\u201320 the next season.  The Dolphins win began a slump for Luck and the Colts against [[AFC East]] teams (eight straight losses by the Colts) that ended in December 2016 against the [[2016 New York Jets season|Jets]], when they defeated them by a score of 41-10.\n\n==Players==\n\n===Current roster===\n{{Indianapolis Colts roster}}\n\n===Retired numbers===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Indianapolis Colts}};\"|'''Indianapolis Colts retired numbers'''\n|-\n! width=40px style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Indianapolis Colts}};\"|No.\n! width=150px style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Indianapolis Colts}};\"|Player\n! width=40px style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Indianapolis Colts}};\"|Position\n! width=100px style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Indianapolis Colts}};\"|Years played\n|-\n| '''18'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jhabvala|first1=Nicki|title=Colts to construct Peyton Manning statue, retire No. 18 jersey \u2013 The Denver Post|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/03/18/colts-to-construct-peyton-manning-statue-retire-no-18-jersey/|website=The Denver Post|accessdate=January 2, 2017|date=March 18, 2016}}</ref> || [[Peyton Manning]] || [[Quarterback|QB]] || 1998\u20132011\n|-\n| '''19''' || [[Johnny Unitas]] || [[Quarterback|QB]]  || 1956\u20131972\n|-\n| '''22''' || [[Buddy Young]] || [[Running back|RB]] || 1953\u20131955\n|-\n| '''24''' || [[Lenny Moore]] || [[Halfback (American football)|HB]] || 1956\u20131967\n|-\n| '''70''' || [[Art Donovan]] || [[Defensive tackle|DT]] || 1953\u20131961\n|-\n| '''77''' || [[Jim Parker (American football)|Jim Parker]] || [[Offensive lineman|OL]] || 1957\u20131967\n|-\n| '''82''' || [[Raymond Berry]] || [[Wide receiver|WR]] || 1955\u20131967\n|-\n| '''89''' || [[Gino Marchetti]] || [[Defensive end|DE]] || 1953\u20131966\n|-\n|}\n\n===Pro Football Hall of Famers===\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Indianapolis Colts}};\"|Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts Hall of Famers\n|-\n! colspan=\"10\" style=\"{{NFLPrimaryStyle|Indianapolis Colts}};\"|Players\n|-\n!

[[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana University's \"Hoosiers\"]] announcer Don Fischer provides play-by-play. ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' broadcasts are usually carried by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WRTV]] (channel 6).\n\nThe team's carriage rights were shaken up in mid-2014 when WTTV's owner [[Tribune Media]] came to terms with [[CBS]] to become the network's Indianapolis affiliate as of January 1, 2015, leaving WISH with the market's affiliation with [[The CW]]. With the deal, both Tribune Media stations, including [[WXIN]] (channel 59) will carry the bulk of the team's regular season games starting with the [[2015 NFL season]] (WXIN will carry a minimum of two home games against NFC opponents under the [[Fox NFL|NFL on Fox]] deal, along with flex-scheduled Sunday games no matter the division matchup), with the team's Wild Card playoff game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] on January 4, 2015 on WTTV rather than new [[The CW|CW]] affiliate WISH. Also as of the 2015 season, WTTV and WXIN became the official Colts stations and air the team's preseason games, along with official team programming and coach's shows, and have a signage presence along the fascia of Lucas Oil Stadium.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/81868/wxinwttv-to-carry-indianapolis-colts|title=WXIN-WTTV To Carry Indianapolis Colts|author=Staff

Each period brought distinct national groups, races and ethnicities to the United States. During the 17th century, approximately 400,000 English people migrated to Colonial America.<ref name=\"virtualjamestown\"/> However, only half stayed permanently. From 1700 to 1775 between 400-500,000 immigrated. Only 45,000 English supposedly immigrated in the period 1701 to 1775 (on Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, p.&nbsp;34-35 {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}), a figure questioned as too low (The Oxford History of the British Empire, The Eighteenth Century, Ed. P. J. Marshall, p.&nbsp;3 {{ISBN|0-19-820563-5}} the number  given is at 80,000 less 29,000 Welsh which seems strange to the author, James Horn; Duncan also regards this as a \"mystery\") not including the 50,000-120,000 convicts transported, most of whom were English: the rest, 400-450,000 were Scots, Scots-Irish from Ulster, Germans and Swiss, French Huguenots, and involuntarily 350,000 Africans (Encyclopedia of the Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1996 p.&nbsp;200-202 {{ISBN|0-306-80687-8}}; Jon Butler, Becoming America, The Revolution before 1776, 2000, pp.&nbsp;16\u201349 {{ISBN|0-674-00091-9}}). Over half of all European immigrants to Colonial America during the 17th and 18th centuries arrived as [[indentured servant]]s.<ref name=\"mertsahinoglu\" /> They numbered 350,000 (Encyclopedia, p.&nbsp;202). The European populations of the Middle Colonies of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware were ethnically very mixed, the English constituting only 30 in Pennsylvania, 40% in New Jersey to 45% in New York (numbered22 thousand or 18% in NY) (Duncan. op. cit. p.&nbsp;10). The mid-19th century saw an influx mainly from northern Europe from the same major ethnic groups as for the Colonial Period but with large numbers of Catholic Irish and Scandinavians added to the mix; the late 19th and early 20th-century immigrants were mainly from Southern and Eastern Europe, but there were also several million immigrants from Canada; post-1965 most came from Latin America and Asia.\n\nHistorians estimate that fewer than 1 million immigrants moved to the United States from Europe between 1600 and 1799.<ref name=\"history\"/> By comparison, in the first federal census, in 1790, the population of the United States was enumerated to be 3,929,214.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/history/www/through_the_decades/fast_facts/1790_fast_facts.html |title=History: 1790 Fast Facts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> The [[Naturalization Act of 1790|1790 Act]] limited naturalization to \"free white persons\"; it was expanded to include blacks in the 1860s and Asians in the 1950s.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: African Americans and Asian Americans\"/> In the early years of the United States, immigration was fewer than 8,000 people a year,<ref name=\"americanheritage\"/> including French refugees from the slave revolt in Haiti. After 1820, immigration gradually increased. From 1836 to 1914, over 30 million Europeans migrated to the United States.<ref name=\"tandfonline\"/> The death rate on these transatlantic voyages was high, during which one in seven travelers died.<ref name=\"Dying and Death in Canada\"/> In 1875, the nation passed its first immigration law, the [[Page Act of 1875]].<ref name=\"The real immigration scare tactics\"/>\n[[File:Ellis island 1902.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Immigrants arriving at [[Ellis Island]], 1902]]\nAfter an initial wave of immigration from China following the [[California Gold Rush]], Congress passed a series of laws culminating in the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, banning virtually all immigration from China until the law's repeal in 1943.

In the most recent decade, the ten million legal immigrants that settled in the U.S. represent an annual growth of only about 0.3% as the U.S. population grew from 249 million to 281 million. By comparison, the highest previous decade was the 1900s, when 8.8 million people arrived, increasing the total U.S. population by one percent every year. Specifically, \"nearly 15% of Americans were foreign-born in 1910, while in 1999, only about 10% were foreign-born.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nBy 1970, immigrants accounted for 4.7 percent of the US population and rising to 6.2 percent in 1980, with an estimated 12.5 percent in 2009.<ref name=\"migrationinformation14\"/> {{As of|2010}}, 25% of US residents under age 18 were first- or second-generation immigrants.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> Eight percent of all babies born in the U.S. in 2008 belonged to illegal immigrant parents, according to a recent analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by the Pew Hispanic Center.<ref name=\"wsj\"/>\n\nLegal immigration to the U.S. increased from 250,000 in the 1930s, to 2.5 million in the 1950s, to 4.5 million in the 1970s, and to 7.3 million in the 1980s, before resting at about 10 million in the 1990s.<ref name=\"findarticles\"/> Since 2000, legal immigrants to the United States number approximately 1,000,000 per year, of whom about 600,000 are ''Change of Status'' who already are in the U.S. Legal immigrants to the United States now are at their highest level ever, at just over 37,000,000 legal immigrants. Illegal immigration may be as high as 1,500,000 per year with a net of at least 700,000 illegal immigrants arriving every year.<ref name=\"csmonitor\"/><ref name=\"pewhispanic\"/> Immigration led to a 57.4% increase in foreign born population from 1990 to 2000.<ref name=\"migrationinformation15\"/>\n\nWhile immigration has increased drastically over the last century, the foreign born share of the population is, at 13.4, only somewhat below what it was at its peak in 1910 at 14.7%. A number of factors may be attributed to the decrease in the representation of foreign born residents in the United States. Most significant has been the change in the composition of immigrants; prior to 1890, 82% of immigrants came from North and Western Europe. From 1891 to 1920, that number dropped to 25%, with a rise in immigrants from East, Central, and South Europe, summing up to 64%. Animosity towards these different and foreign immigrants rose in the United States, resulting in much legislation to limit immigration.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\nContemporary immigrants settle predominantly in seven states, [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Florida]], [[Texas]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Illinois]], comprising about 44% of the U.S. population as a whole. The combined total immigrant population of these seven states was 70% of the total foreign-born population in 2000.\n\n===Origin===\n\n[[File:US foreign-born

Chavez and [[Dolores Huerta]], cofounder and president of the UFW, fought the [[Bracero Program]] that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants.\n\nOn a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to a number of controversial events, which the UFW describes as anti-strikebreaking events, but which have also been interpreted as being anti-immigrant. In 1973, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. Joining him on the march were Reverend [[Ralph Abernathy]] and U.S. Senator [[Walter Mondale]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov:8081/ammem/today/aug22.html|title=Today in History: August

However, children born in foreign countries to United States servicemembers before they have gained citizenship could only gain citizenship through the naturalization process.\n\n===Treatment as civil proceedings===\n\nMost immigration proceedings are [[Civil law (common law)|civil matters]], including deportation proceedings, asylum cases, employment without authorization, and visa overstay. People who evade border enforcement (such as by crossing outside any official border checkpoint), who commit fraud to gain entry, or who commit [[identity theft]] to gain employment, may face criminal charges. People entering illegally were seldom charged with this crime until [[Operation Streamline]] in 2005.

As a result, people generally represent themselves in asylum and deportation cases unless they can afford an [[immigration lawyer]] or receive assistance from a legal charity. In contrast, the [[Due Process Clause]] of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] ''has'' been applied to immigration proceedings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aliens' Right to Counsel in Removal Proceedings: In Brief |url=http://trac.syr.edu/immigration/library/P11612.pdf |publisher=Congressional Research Service |author=Kate M.

Davis]]'' held that immigrants who cannot be deported because no country will accept them cannot be detained indefinitely.\n\n==Immigration in popular culture==\n[[File:Immigrants1888.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A cartoon in [[Puck (magazine)|''Puck'']] from 1888 attacked businessmen for welcoming large numbers of low paid immigrants, leaving the American men unemployed.<ref name=\"amerikastudien\"/>]]\nThe history of immigration to the United States is the history of the country itself, and the journey from beyond the sea is an element found in [[American folklore]], appearing over and over again in everything from ''[[The Godfather]]'' to ''[[Gangs of New York]]'' to \"[[Song of Myself|The Song of Myself]]\" to [[Neil Diamond]]'s \"America\" to the animated feature ''[[An American Tail]]''.<ref name=\"introduction\"/>\n\nFrom the 1880s to the 1910s, vaudeville dominated the popular image of immigrants, with very popular caricature portrayals of ethnic groups. The specific features of these caricatures became widely accepted as accurate portrayals.<ref name=\"amerikastudien54\"/>\n\nIn ''The Melting Pot'' (1908), playwright [[Israel Zangwill]] (1864\u20131926) explored issues that dominated [[Progressive Era]] debates about immigration policies. Zangwill's theme of the positive benefits of the American [[melting pot]] resonated widely in popular culture and literary and academic circles in the 20th century; his cultural symbolism \u2013 in which he situated immigration issues \u2013 likewise informed American cultural imagining of immigrants for decades, as exemplified by Hollywood films.<ref name=\"interdisciplinary55\"/><ref name=\"immigrants\"/>\nThe popular culture's image of ethnic celebrities often includes stereotypes about immigrant groups. For example, Frank Sinatra's public image as a superstar contained important elements of the ''[[American Dream]]'' while simultaneously incorporating stereotypes about Italian Americans that were based in nativist and Progressive responses to immigration.<ref name=\"frontani\"/>\n\nThe process of assimilation has been a common theme of popular culture. For example, \"lace-curtain Irish\" refers to middle-class [[Irish Americans]] desiring assimilation into mainstream society in counterpoint to the older, more raffish \"shanty Irish\". The occasional malapropisms and left-footed social blunders of these upward mobiles were gleefully lampooned in vaudeville, popular song, and the comic strips of the day such as ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'', starring Maggie and Jiggs, which ran in daily newspapers for 87 years (1913 to 2000).<ref name=\"williams\"/><ref name=\"assimilation56\"/> In ''[[The Departed]]'' (2006), Staff Sergeant Dignam regularly points out the dichotomy between the lace curtain Irish lifestyle Billy Costigan enjoyed with his mother, and the shanty Irish lifestyle of Costigan's father. In recent years the popular culture has paid special attention to Mexican immigration<ref name=\"immigration57\"/> and the film ''[[Spanglish (film)|Spanglish]]'' (2004) tells of a friendship of a Mexican housemaid ([[Paz Vega]]) and her boss played by [[Adam Sandler]].\n\n===Immigration in literature===\n[[File:Jiggsslum1740.jpg|right|upright=1.6|thumb|Maggie and Jiggs from ''[[Bringing Up Father]]'' (January 7, 1940).]]\nNovelists and writers have captured much of the color and challenge in their immigrant lives through their writings.<ref>Thomas J.

In the novel, the heroine, Sara Smolinsky, escape from New York City's \"down-town ghetto\" by breaking tradition.

The show is based on the story of Harelik's grandparents, Matleh and Haskell Harelik, who traveled to [[Galveston, Texas]] in 1909.<ref name=\"colonytheatre\"/>\n\n==Documentary films==\n[[File:Immigrant to America.ogv|thumbtime=3:24|thumb|Film about historical immigration to America from ca. 1970]] \nIn their documentary ''[[How Democracy Works Now: Twelve Stories]]'', filmmakers [[Shari Robertson]] and [[Michael Camerini]] examine the American political system through the lens of [[immigration reform]] from 2001 to 2007. Since the debut of the first five films, the series has become an important resource for advocates, policy-makers and educators.<ref name=\"typepad\"/>\n\nThat film series premiered nearly a decade after the filmmakers' landmark documentary film ''[[Well-Founded Fear]]'' which provided a behind-the-scenes look at the [[Asylum in the United States|process for seeking asylum in the United States]]. That film still marks the only time that a film-crew was privy to the private proceedings at the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), where individual asylum officers ponder the often life-or-death fate of immigrants seeking asylum.\n\n==Overall approach to regulation==\nUniversity of North Carolina law professor Hiroshi Motomura has identified three approaches the United States has taken to the legal status of immigrants in his book ''Americans in Waiting: The Lost Story of Immigration and Citizenship in the United States''. The first, dominant in the 19th century, treated immigrants as in transition; in other words, as prospective citizens. As soon as people declared their intention to become citizens, they received multiple low-cost benefits, including the eligibility for free homesteads in the [[Homestead Act]] of 1869, and in many states, the right to vote. The goal was to make the country more attractive, so large numbers of farmers and skilled craftsmen would settle new lands. By the 1880s, a second approach took over, treating newcomers as \"immigrants by contract\". An implicit deal existed where immigrants who were literate and could earn their own living were permitted in restricted numbers. Once in the United States, they would have limited legal rights, but were not allowed to vote until they became citizens, and would not be eligible for the New Deal government benefits available in the 1930s. The third and more recent policy{{When|date=July 2010}} is \"immigration by affiliation\", which Motomura argues is the treatment which depends on how deeply rooted people have become in the country. An immigrant who applies for citizenship as soon as permitted, has a long history of working in the United States, and has significant family ties, is more deeply affiliated and can expect better treatment.<ref name=\"immigration59\"/>\n\n[[File:Statue-de-la-liberte-new-york.jpg|upright=0.7|thumb|right|The [[Statue of Liberty]] was a common sight to many immigrants who entered the United States through [[Ellis Island]]]]\nThe [[American Dream]] is the belief that through hard work and determination, any United States immigrant can achieve a better life, usually in terms of financial prosperity and enhanced personal freedom of choice.<ref name=\"economics\"/> According to historians, the rapid economic and industrial expansion of the U.S. is not simply a function of being a resource rich, hard working, and inventive country, but the belief that anybody could get a share of the country's wealth if he or she was willing to work hard.<ref name=\"pennsylvania\"/> This dream has been a major factor in attracting immigrants to the United States.<ref name=\"american\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Demographics of the United States]]\n* [[Emigration from the United States]]\n*

It is currently supported by a number of application and scanner vendors.\n\n==Functions==\nThe modular design allows the scanner to be accessed both directly or with built-in routines to handle most situations automatically.\n\nA message-based interface with [[Tag (metadata)|tags]] is used so that features, operations, and formats not yet supported by ISIS can be added as desired without waiting for a new version of the specification.\n\nThe standard addresses all of the issues that an application using a scanner needs to be concerned with. Functions include but are not limited to selecting, installing, and configuring a new scanner; setting scanner-specific parameters; scanning, reading and writing files, and fast [[image scaling]], rotating, displaying, and printing. Drivers have been written to dynamically process data for operations such as converting grayscale to binary image data.\n\nAn ISIS interface can run scanners at or above their rated speed by linking drivers together in a pipe so that data flows from a scanner driver to compression driver, to packaging driver, to a file, viewer, or printer in a continuous stream, usually without the need to buffer more than a small portion of the full image. As a result of using the piping method, each driver can be optimised to perform one function well. Drivers are typically small and modular in order to make it simple to add new functionality to an existing application.\n\n==SDKs==\n* [http://www.emc.com/products/detail/software/pixtools.htm EMC Captiva PixTools - imaging SDKs for C++/.NET]\n* [http://www.atalasoft.com/products/dotimage/ Atalasoft DotImage - imaging SDK for .NET]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Scanner Access Now Easy]] (SANE)\n* [[TWAIN]]\n* [[Windows Image Acquisition]] (WIA)\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.emc.com/enterprise-content-management/captiva/captiva.htm EMC Captiva]\n* [https://community.emc.com/community/edn/isis Official portal for ISIS developers]\n\n[[Category:Image scanning]]\n[[Category:Standards]]\n\n{{graphics-software-stub}}", "sha1": "2oghafmws943575zxa2znh333ctk1ht"}}, {"title": "Ivo Caprino", "ns": "0", "id": "15053", "revision": {"id": "853580314", "parentid": "853579421", "timestamp": "2018-08-05T19:27:28Z", "contributor": {"username": "Oceanh", "id": "719157"}, "comment": "citations", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More footnotes|date=May 2007}}\n{{Primary sources|date=June 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox person\n| image = Ivo Caprino.jpg \n| caption = Ivo Caprino in 1970\n| birth_date = {{Birth date|df=yes|1920|2|17}}\n| birth_place = Oslo, Norway\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|df=yes|2001|2|8|1920|2|17}}\n| death_place = Oslo, Norway\n| spouse = Liv Bredal (divorced)\n| occupation = Film director, screenwriter\n| networth =\n| years_active =\n}}\n'''Ivo Caprino''' (17 February 1920&nbsp;\u2013 8 February 2001) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] film director and writer, best known for his [[puppet]] films. His most famous film is ''[[Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix]]'' (\"Pinchcliffe Grand Prix\"), made in 1975.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n==Early career==\n{{unsourced|section|date=August 2017}}\n[[File:Filmmuseet Oslo.jpg|thumb|Original dolls used in Ivo Caprino's films which are exhibited in the Norwegian Film Museum in Oslo.]]\nIn the mid-1940s, Caprino helped his mother design puppets for a puppet theatre, which inspired him to try making a film using his mother's designs. The result of their collaboration was ''Tim og T\u00f8ffe'', an 8-minute film released in 1949. \n\nSeveral films followed in the next couple of years, including two 15-minute shorts that are still shown regularly in Norway today, ''Veslefrikk med Fela'' (Little Freddy and his Fiddle), based on a Norwegian folk tale, and ''Karius og Baktus'', a story by [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner]] of two little trolls, representing [[Dental caries|Caries]] and [[Bacteria|Bacterium]], living in a boy's teeth. Ingeborg Gude made the puppets for these films as well, as she would continue to do up until her death in the mid sixties.\n\nWhen making ''Tim og T\u00f8ffe'', Caprino invented an ingenious method for controlling the puppet's movements in real time. The technique can be described as a primitive, mechanical version of [[Audio-animatronics|animatronics]].\n\nCaprino's films received rave reviews, and he quickly became a celebrity in Norway. In particular, the public were fascinated with the secret technology used to make his films. When he switched to traditional [[stop motion]], Caprino tried to maintain the impression that he was still using some kind of \"magic\" technology to make the puppets move, even though all his later films were made with traditional stop motion techniques.\n\nIn addition to the short films, Caprino produced dozens of advertising films with puppets. In 1959, he directed a live action feature film, ''Ugler i Mosen'', which also contained stop motion sequences. He then embarked on his most ambitious project, a feature film about [[Peter Christen Asbj\u00f8rnsen]], who travelled around Norway in the 19th century collecting traditional folk tales. \n\nThe plan was to use live action for the sequences showing Asbj\u00f8rnsen, and then to realise the folk tales using stop motion. Unfortunately, Caprino was unable to secure funding for the project, so he ended up making the planned folk tale sequences as separate 16-minute puppet films, bookended by live action sequences showing Asbj\u00f8rnsen.\n\n==''The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix''==\n{{unsourced|section|date=February 2017}}\nIn 1970, Caprino and his small team of collaborators, started work on a 25 minutes TV special, which would eventually become ''[[The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix]]''. Based on a series of books by Norwegian cartoonist and author [[Kjell Aukrust]], it featured a group of eccentric characters all living in the small village of Pinchcliffe. The TV special was a collection of sketches based on Aukrust's books, with no real story line. After 1.5 years of work, it was decided that it didn't really work as a whole, so production on the TV special was stopped (with the exception of some very short clips, no material from it has ever been seen by the public), and Caprino and Aukrust instead wrote a screenplay for a feature film using the characters and environments that had already been built.\n\nThe result was ''The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix'', which stars Theodore Rimspoke ([[Norwegian language|No]]. Reodor Felgen) and his two assistants, Sonny Duckworth ([[Norwegian language|No]]. Solan Gundersen), a cheerful and optimistic bird, and Lambert ([[Norwegian language|No]]. Ludvig), a nervous, pessimistic and melancholic hedgehog. Theodore works as a bicycle repairman, though he spends most of his time inventing weird [[Rube Goldberg]]-like contraptions. One day, the trio discover that one of Theodore's former assistants, Rudolph Gore-Slimey ({{lang-no|Rudolf Blodstrupmoen}}), has stolen his design for a race car engine, and has become a world champion [[Formula One]] driver.\n\nSonny secures funding from an Arab oil sheik who happens to be vacationing in Pinchcliffe, and the trio then build a gigantic racing car, ''[[Il Tempo Gigante]]''&nbsp;\u2013 a fabulous construction with two engines, radar and its own blood bank. Theodore then enters a race, and ends up winning, beating Gore-Slimey despite his attempts at sabotage.\n\nThe film was made in 3.5 years by a team of approximately 5 people. Caprino directed and animated, Bjarne Sandemose (Caprino's principal collaborator throughout his career) built the sets and the cars, and was in charge of the technical side, Ingeborg Riiser modeled the puppets and Gerd Alfsen made the costumes and props.\n\nWhen it came out in 1975, The Pinchcliffe Grand Prix was an enormous success in Norway, selling 1 million tickets in its first year of release. It remains the biggest box office hit of all time in Norway (Caprino Studios claim it has sold 5.5 million tickets to date) and was also released in many other countries.\n\nTo help promote the film abroad, Caprino and Sandemose built a full-scale replica of Il Tempo Gigante that is legal for public roads, but is usually exposited at [[Hunderfossen Familiepark]].\n\n==Later career==\n{{unsourced|section|date=February 2017}}\nExcept for some TV work in the late 1970s, Caprino made no more puppet films, focusing instead on creating attractions for the ''[[Hunderfossen Familiepark|Hunderfossen]]'' theme park outside [[Lillehammer]] based on his folk tale movies, and making tourist films using a custom built multi camera setup of his own design that shoots 280 degrees panorama movies.\n\n== Personal life ==\nCaprino was the son of Italian  furniture designer Mario Caprino and the artist Ingeborg Gude,<ref name=nbl>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Ivo Caprino |encyclopedia=[[Norsk biografisk leksikon]]|first=Per  |last=Haddal |authorlink= |editor=[[Knut Helle|Helle, Knut]]|publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo |url=https://nbl.snl.no/Ivo_Caprino | language=Norwegian |accessdate=5 August 2018}}</ref> who was a granddaughter of the painter [[Hans Gude]].<ref name=nbl/> He was born and died in [[Oslo]], but lived all of his life at [[Snar\u00f8ya]] in [[B\u00e6rum]].<ref name=nbl/> He died in 2001 after having lived several years with a cancer diagnosis.<ref>[http://www.vg.no/rampelys/artikkel.php?artid=2277245 Mistet min beste venn] [[Verdens Gang]], retrieved 9 January 2013</ref> Since Caprino's death, his son Remo has had great success developing a computer game based on ''[[Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix]]''.\n\n== Filmography ==\n[[File:Il Tempo Gigante.jpg|thumb|''[[Fl\u00e5klypa Grand Prix]]'', a Norwegian stop motion-animated feature film from 1975, was Ivo Caprino's most successful film.

[[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] and [[Harris Corporation|Harris]] later produced 16&nbsp;MHz, 20&nbsp;MHz and 25&nbsp;MHz parts, respectively. [[Intersil]] and [[Fujitsu]] also designed fully static [[CMOS]] versions of Intel's original [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-load nMOS]] implementation, largely aimed at battery-powered devices.\n\nOn average, the 80286 was reportedly measured to have a speed of about 0.21 [[Instructions per cycle|instructions per clock]] on \"typical\" programs,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.intel80386.com|title=Intel Architecure &#91;sic&#93; Programming and Information| publisher=Intel80386.com|date=January 13, 2004|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}</ref> although it could be significantly faster on optimized code and in tight loops, as many instructions could execute in [[Clock cycles per instruction|2 clock cycles]] each.

It had 134,000 [[transistor]]s and consisted of four independent units: address unit, bus unit, instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a [[loosely coupled]] (buffered) [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] just as in the 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the [[multiplexing|non-multiplexed]] address and [[Bus (computing)|data buses]], more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier.<ref name=Bahadure2010>{{cite book |last=Bahadure |first=Nilesh B. |title=Microprocessors: 8086/8088, 80186/80286, 80386/80486 and the Pentium Family |publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

This was a large increase, fully comparable to the speed improvements around a decade later when the [[Intel 80486|i486]] (1989) or the original [[Pentium]] (1993) were introduced. This was partly due to the non-multiplexed address and data buses, but mainly to the fact that address calculations (such as [[Addressing mode#Base plus index|base+index]]) were less expensive. They were performed by a dedicated unit in the 80286, while the older 8086 had to do effective address computation using its general [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]], consuming several extra clock cycles in many cases. Also, the 80286 was more efficient in the prefetch of instructions, buffering, execution of jumps, and in complex [[microcode]]d numerical operations such as [[multiplication|MUL]]/[[division (mathematics)|DIV]] than its predecessor.<ref name=Bahadure2010/>\n\nThe 80286 included, in addition to all of the 8086 instructions, all of the new instructions of the 80186: ENTER, LEAVE, BOUND, INS, OUTS, PUSHA, POPA, PUSH immediate, IMUL immediate, and immediate shifts and rotates.  The 80286 also added new instructions for protected mode: ARPL, CLTS, LAR, LGDT, LIDT, LLDT, LMSW, LSL, LTR, SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, SMSW, STR, VERR, and VERW.  Some of the instructions for protected mode can (or must) be used in real mode to set up and switch to protected mode, and a few (such as SMSW and LMSW) are useful for real mode itself.\n\nThe Intel 80286 had a 24-bit address bus and was able to address up to 16&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], compared to the 1&nbsp;MB addressability of its predecessor. However, memory cost and the initial rarity of software using the memory above 1&nbsp;MB meant that 80286 computers were rarely shipped with more than one megabyte of RAM.<ref name=Bahadure2010/> Additionally, there was a performance penalty involved in accessing extended memory from real mode (in which DOS, the dominant PC operating system until the mid-1990s, ran), as noted below.\n\n==Features==\n[[Image:80286-processor-made-in-austria.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Siemens 80286 (10 MHz version)]]\n[[Image:KL IBM 80286.jpg|thumb|150px|right|IBM 80286 (8 MHz version)]]\n\n===Protected mode===\nThe 286 was the first of the x86 CPU family to support ''protected virtual-address mode'', commonly called \"[[protected mode]]\". In addition, it was the first commercially available microprocessor with on-chip [[Memory management unit|MMU]] capabilities (systems using the contemporaneous [[Motorola 68010]] and [[NS320xx]] could be equipped with an optional MMU controller).  This would allow IBM compatibles to have advanced multitasking OSes for the first time and compete in the [[Unix]]-dominated [[network server|server]]/[[workstation]] market.\n\nSeveral additional instructions were introduced in protected mode of 80286, which are helpful for multitasking operating systems.\n\nAnother important feature of 80286 is prevention of unauthorized access. This is achieved by:\n* Forming different segments for data, code, and stack, and preventing their overlapping.\n* Assigning privilege levels to each segment. Segment with lower privilege level cannot access the segment with higher privilege level.\n\nIn 80286 (and in its co-processor [[Intel 80287]]), arithmetic operations can be performed on the following different types of numbers:\n* unsigned [[packed decimal]],\n* unsigned binary,\n* unsigned unpacked decimal,\n* signed binary,\n* [[floating-point number]]s (only with an [[80287]]).\n\nBy design, the 286 could not revert from protected mode to the basic 8086-compatible ''real address mode'' (\"[[real mode]]\") without a hardware-initiated reset. In the PC/AT introduced in 1984, IBM added external circuitry, as well as specialized code in the [[ROM BIOS]] and the [[8042]] peripheral microcontroller to enable software to cause the reset, allowing real-mode reentry while retaining active memory and returning control to the program that initiated the reset. (The BIOS is necessarily involved because it obtains control directly whenever the CPU resets.) Though it worked correctly, the method imposed a huge performance penalty.\n\nIn theory, real-mode applications could be [[Protected mode#Real mode application compatibility|directly executed in 16-bit protected mode]] if certain rules (newly proposed with the introduction of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the [[32-bit]] [[Intel 80386]], which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and then switch to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.\n\nTo support protected mode, new instructions have been added: ARPL, VERR, VERW, LAR, LSL, SMSW, SGDT, SIDT, SLDT, STR, LMSW, LGDT, LIDT, LLDT, LTR, CLTS.  There are also new exceptions (internal interrupts): invalid opcode, coprocessor not available, double fault, coprocessor segment overrun, stack fault, segment overrun/general protection fault, and others only for protected mode.\n\n===OS support===\nThe protected mode of the 80286 was not utilized until many years after its release, in part because of the high cost of adding extended memory to a PC, but also because of the need for software to support the large user base of 8086 PCs. For example, in 1986 the only program that made use of it was VDISK, a [[RAM disk]] driver included with [[PC DOS]] 3.0 and 3.1. A [[DOS]] could utilize the additional RAM available in protected mode ([[extended memory]]) either via a [[BIOS]] call (INT 15h, AH=87h), as a [[RAM disk]], or as [[Emulator|emulation]] of [[expanded memory]].<ref name=Bahadure2010/> The difficulty lay in the incompatibility of older [[real-mode]] DOS programs with protected mode. They simply could not natively run in this new mode without significant modification. In protected mode, memory management and interrupt handling were done differently than in real mode. In addition, DOS programs typically would directly access data and code segments that did not belong to them, as real mode allowed them to do without restriction; in contrast, the design intent of protected mode was to prevent programs from accessing any segments other than their own unless special access was explicitly allowed. While it was possible to set up a protected-mode environment that allowed all programs access to all segments (by putting all segment descriptors into the GDT and assigning them all the same privilege level), this undermined nearly all of the advantages of protected mode except the extended (24-bit) address space. The choice that OS developers faced was either to start from scratch and create an OS that would not run the vast majority of the old programs, or to come up with a version of DOS that was slow and ugly (i.e., ugly from an internal technical viewpoint) but would still run a majority of the old programs. Protected mode also did not provide a significant enough performance advantage over the 8086-compatible real mode to justify supporting its capabilities; actually, except for task switches when multitasking, it actually yielded only a performance disadvantage, by slowing down many instructions through a litany of added privilege checks. In protected mode, registers were still 16-bit, and the programmer was still forced to use a memory map composed of 64&nbsp;kB segments, just like in real mode.<ref name=PCMAG1986>{{cite journal|author-last=Petzold |author-first=Charles|author-link=Charles Petzold |title=Obstacles to a grown up operating system|journal=PC Magazine|volume=5|issue=11|pages=170\u201374|year=1986|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pDGnxFyejN4C&pg=PA170}}</ref>\n\nIn January 1985, [[Digital Research]] previewed the [[Concurrent DOS 286]] 1.0 operating system developed in cooperation with [[Intel]].

Intel said that the approach Digital Research wished to take in emulating 8086 software in protected mode differed from the original specifications.

It was arguably responsible for the split between [[Microsoft]] and IBM, since IBM insisted that [[OS/2]], originally a joint venture between IBM and Microsoft, would run on a 286 (and in text mode).\n\nOther operating systems that used the protected mode of the 286 were Microsoft [[Xenix]] (around 1984),<ref>http://www.tenox.net/docs/microsoft_xenix_30_286_press_release.pdf.</ref> [[Coherent (operating system)|Coherent]],<ref>http://textfiles.com/internet/FAQ/coherent.faq.</ref> and [[Minix]].<ref>http://minix.net/minix/minix.html.</ref> These were less hindered by the limitations of the 80286 protected mode because they did not aim to run MS-DOS applications or other real-mode programs.

At the time it was written it represented a shift by Scott away from fairly realistic novels set in Scotland in the comparatively recent past, to a somewhat fanciful depiction of medieval England.  It has proved to be one of the best known and most influential of Scott's novels.\n\n''Ivanhoe'' is set in 12th-century [[Kingdom of England|England]], with colourful descriptions of a tournament, outlaws, a witch trial and divisions between Jews and Christians.  It has been credited for increasing interest in [[chivalric romance|romance]] and [[medievalism]]; [[John Henry Newman]] claimed Scott \"had first turned men's minds in the direction of the Middle Ages\", while [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] and [[John Ruskin|Ruskin]] made similar assertions of Scott's overwhelming influence over the revival, based primarily on the publication of this novel.<ref>Alice Chandler, \"Sir Walter Scott and the Medieval Revival\", ''Nineteenth-Century Fiction'' 19.4 (March 1965): 315\u2013332.</ref> It has also had an important influence on popular perceptions of  [[Richard the Lionheart]], [[John, King of England|King John]], and [[Robin Hood]].\n\nThere have been several adaptations for stage, film and television.\n\n==Plot introduction==\n''Ivanhoe'' is the story of one of the remaining [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] noble families at a time when the nobility in England was overwhelmingly [[Normans|Norman]]. It follows the Saxon protagonist, Sir Wilfred of Ivanhoe, who is out of favour with his father for his allegiance to the Norman king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]]. The story is set in 1194, after the failure of the [[Third Crusade]], when many of the Crusaders were still returning to their homes in Europe. King Richard, who had been captured by [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold of Austria]] on his return journey to England, was believed to still be in captivity.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Opening===\nProtagonist Wilfred of Ivanhoe is disinherited by his father Cedric of Rotherwood for supporting the Norman King Richard and for falling in love with the Lady Rowena, a ward of Cedric's and descendant of the Saxon Kings of England. Cedric planned to marry Rowena to the powerful Lord Athelstane, a [[pretender]] to the Crown of England by his descent from the last Saxon King, [[Harold Godwinson]]. Ivanhoe accompanies King Richard on the [[Crusades]], where he is said to have played a notable role in the [[Siege of Acre (1189\u20131191)|Siege of Acre]]; and tends to Louis of Thuringia, who suffers from malaria.\n\nThe book opens with a scene of Norman knights and prelates seeking the hospitality of Cedric. They are guided there by a [[pilgrim]], known at that time as a [[Palmer (pilgrim)|palmer]]. Also returning from the [[Holy Land]] that same night, Isaac of [[York]], a Jewish moneylender, seeks refuge at Rotherwood. Following the night's meal, the palmer observes one of the Normans, the [[Templar]] Brian de Bois-Guilbert, issue orders to his [[Saracen]] soldiers to capture Isaac.\n\nThe palmer then assists in Isaac's escape from Rotherwood, with the additional aid of the [[swineherd]] Gurth.\n\nIsaac of York offers to repay his debt to the palmer with a suit of armour and a [[destrier|war horse]] to participate in the [[tournament]] at [[Ashby-de-la-Zouch]] Castle, on his inference that the palmer was secretly a knight. The palmer is taken by surprise, but accepts the offer.\n\n===The tournament===\nThe tournament is presided over by [[John, King of England|Prince John]]. Other characters in attendance are Cedric, Athelstane, Lady Rowena, Isaac of York, his daughter Rebecca, [[Robin Hood|Robin of Locksley]] and his men, Prince John's advisor Waldemar Fitzurse, and numerous Norman [[knight]]s.\n\nOn the first day of the tournament, a bout of individual [[joust]]ing, a mysterious knight, identifying himself only as \"Desdichado\" (described in the book as Spanish, taken by the Saxons to mean Disinherited), defeats some of the best Norman competitors, including Bois-Guilbert, Maurice de Bracy (a leader of a group of \"[[Free company|Free Companions]]\"), and the baron Reginald Front-de-Boeuf. The masked knight declines to reveal himself despite Prince John's request, but is nevertheless declared the champion of the day and is permitted to choose the Queen of the Tournament. He bestows this honour upon the Lady Rowena.\n\nOn the second day, at a [[Tournament (medieval)#Melee|melee]], Desdichado is the leader of one party, opposed by his former adversaries. Desdichado's side is soon hard pressed and he himself beset by multiple foes until rescued by a knight nicknamed 'Le Noir Faineant' (\"the Black Sluggard\"), who thereafter departs in secret. When forced to unmask himself to receive his coronet (the sign of championship), Desdichado is identified as Wilfred of Ivanhoe, returned from the Crusades. This causes much consternation to Prince John and his court who now fear the imminent return of King Richard.\n\nIvanhoe is severely wounded in the competition yet his father does not move quickly to tend to him. Instead, Rebecca, a skilled [[healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] tends to him while they are lodged near the tournament and then convinces her father to take Ivanhoe with them to their home in York, when he is fit for that trip. The conclusion of the tournament includes feats of archery by Locksley, such as splitting a willow reed with his arrow. Prince John\u2019s dinner for the local Saxons ends in insults.\n\n===Capture and rescue===\nIn the forests between Ashby and York, Isaac, Rebecca and the wounded Ivanhoe are abandoned by their guards, who fear bandits and take all Isaac\u2019s horses. Cedric, Athelstane and the Lady Rowena meet them and agree to travel together.  The party is captured by de Bracy and his companions and taken to Torquilstone, the castle of Front-de-Boeuf. The swineherd Gurth and Wamba the jester manage to escape, and then encounter Locksley, who plans a rescue.\n\n[[File:J. Cooper, Sr. - Sir Walter Scott - Le Noir Faineant in the Hermit's Cell - Ivanhoe.jpg|thumb|''Le Noir Faineant in the Hermit's Cell'' by J. Cooper, Sr. From an 1886 edition of Walter Scott's works]]\n\nThe Black Knight, having taken refuge for the night in the hut of a [[Friar Tuck|local friar]], the Holy Clerk of Copmanhurst, volunteers his assistance on learning about the captives from Robin of Locksley. They then besiege the Castle of Torquilstone with Robin's own men, including the friar and assorted Saxon yeomen. Inside Torquilstone, de Bracy expresses his love for the Lady Rowena but is refused. Brian de Bois-Guilbert tries to seduce Rebecca and is rebuffed. Front-de-Boeuf tries to wring a hefty ransom from Isaac of York, but Isaac refuses to pay unless his daughter is freed.\n\nWhen the besiegers deliver a note to yield up the captives, their Norman captors demand a priest to administer the [[Final Sacrament]] to Cedric; whereupon Cedric's [[jester]] Wamba slips in disguised as a priest, and takes the place of Cedric, who escapes and brings important information to the besiegers on the strength of the garrison and its layout. The besiegers storm the castle. The castle is set aflame during the assault by Ulrica, the daughter of the original lord of the castle, Lord Torquilstone, as revenge for her father's death. Front-de-Boeuf is killed in the fire while de Bracy surrenders to the Black Knight, who identifies himself as King Richard and releases de Bracy. Bois-Guilbert escapes with Rebecca while Isaac is rescued by the Clerk of Copmanhurst. The Lady Rowena is saved by Cedric, while the still-wounded Ivanhoe is rescued from the burning castle by King Richard. In the fighting, Athelstane is wounded and presumed dead while attempting to rescue Rebecca, whom he mistakes for Rowena.\n\n===Rebecca's trial and Ivanhoe's reconciliation===\nFollowing the battle, Locksley plays host to King Richard. Word is also conveyed by de Bracy to Prince John of the King's return and the fall of Torquilstone. In the meantime, Bois-Guilbert rushes with his captive to the nearest Templar Preceptory, where Lucas de Beaumanoir, the [[Grand Masters of the Knights Templar|Grand-Master of the Templars]], takes umbrage at Bois-Guilbert's infatuation and subjects Rebecca to a trial for witchcraft. At Bois-Guilbert's secret request, she claims the right to [[trial by combat]]; and Bois-Guilbert, who had hoped for the position, is devastated when the Grand-Master orders him to fight against Rebecca's champion. Rebecca then writes to her father to procure a champion for her. Cedric organises Athelstane's funeral at [[Conisbrough|Coningsburgh]], in the midst of which the Black Knight arrives with a companion. Cedric, who had not been present at Locksley's carousal, is ill-disposed towards the knight upon learning his true identity; but Richard calms Cedric and reconciles him with his son. During this conversation, Athelstane emerges \u2013 not dead, but laid in his coffin alive by monks desirous of the funeral money. Over Cedric's renewed protests, Athelstane pledges his homage to the Norman King Richard and urges Cedric to marry Rowena to Ivanhoe; to which Cedric finally agrees.\n\nSoon after this reconciliation, Ivanhoe receives word from Isaac beseeching him to fight on Rebecca's behalf. Ivanhoe, riding by day and night, arrives in time for the trial by combat, but horse and man are exhausted, with little chance of victory. The two knights make one charge at each other with lances, Bois-Guilbert appearing to have the advantage. However, Bois-Guilbert, a man trying to have it all without offering to marry Rebecca, dies in the saddle before the combat can continue, dead of natural causes.\n\nFearing further persecution, Rebecca and her father plan to leave England for [[Granada]]. Before leaving, Rebecca comes to bid Rowena a fond farewell on her wedding day. Ivanhoe and Rowena marry and live a long and happy life together. Ivanhoe's military service ended with the death of King Richard.\n\n==Characters==\n* ''Wilfred of Ivanhoe'' - the eponymous character, is a knight and son of Cedric the Saxon.

In the latter novels, industrial society becomes the centre of this conflict as the backward Scottish nationalists and the \"advanced\" English have to arise from chaos to create unity. Similarly, the Normans in ''Ivanhoe'', who represent a more sophisticated culture, and the Saxons, who are poor, disenfranchised, and resentful of Norman rule, band together and begin to mould themselves into one people. The conflict between the Saxons and Normans focuses on the losses both groups must experience before they can be reconciled and thus forge a united England. The particular loss is in the extremes of their own cultural values, which must be disavowed in order for the society to function. For the Saxons, this value is the final admission of the hopelessness of the Saxon cause. The Normans must learn to overcome the materialism and violence in their own codes of chivalry. Ivanhoe and Richard represent the hope of reconciliation for a unified future.<ref name = Duncan/>\n\nIvanhoe, though of a more noble lineage than some of the other characters, represents a middling individual in the medieval class system who is not exceptionally outstanding in his abilities, as is expected of other quasi-historical fictional characters, such as the [[Greek hero]]es. Critic [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] points to middling main characters like Ivanhoe in Sir Walter Scott's other novels as one of the primary reasons Scott's historical novels depart from previous historical works, and better explore social and cultural history.<ref name= \"Lukas31\u201338\">{{cite book |title=The Historical Novel |first=Georg |last=Lukacs |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1969 |pages=31-39}}</ref>\n\n==Allusions to real history and geography==\nThe location of the novel is centred upon southern [[Yorkshire]] and northern [[Nottinghamshire]] in England. Castles mentioned within the story include [[Ashby de la Zouch Castle]] (now a ruin in the care of [[English Heritage]]), York (though the mention of [[Clifford's Tower]], likewise an extant English Heritage property, is [[anachronistic]], it not having been called that until later after various rebuilds) and 'Coningsburgh', which is based upon [[Conisbrough Castle]], in the ancient town of [[Conisbrough]] near [[Doncaster]] (the castle also being a popular English Heritage site). Reference is made within the story to [[York Minster]], where the climactic wedding takes place, and to the Bishop of Sheffield, although the [[Diocese of Sheffield]] did not exist at either the time of the novel or the time Scott wrote the novel and was not founded until 1914. Such references suggest that Robin Hood lived or travelled in the region.\n\nConisbrough is so dedicated to the story of ''Ivanhoe'' that many of its streets, schools, and public buildings are named after characters from the book.\n\n===Lasting influence on the Robin Hood legend===\nThe modern conception of Robin Hood as a cheerful, decent, patriotic rebel owes much to ''Ivanhoe''.\n\n\"Locksley\" becomes Robin Hood's title in the Scott novel, and it has been used ever since to refer to the legendary [[outlaw]]. Scott appears to have taken the name from an anonymous [[manuscript]] \u2013 written in 1600 \u2013 that employs \"Locksley\" as an epithet for Robin Hood. Owing to Scott's decision to make use of the manuscript, Robin Hood from Locksley has been transformed for all time into \"'''Robin of Locksley'''\", alias Robin Hood. (There is, incidentally, a village called [[Loxley, South Yorkshire|Loxley]] in Yorkshire.)\n\nScott makes the 12th-century's Saxon-Norman conflict a major theme in his novel. Recent re-tellings of the story retain his emphasis. Scott also shunned the late 16th-century depiction of Robin as a dispossessed nobleman (the Earl of Huntingdon). This, however, has not prevented Scott from making an important contribution to the noble-hero strand of the legend, too, because some subsequent motion picture treatments of Robin Hood's adventures give Robin traits that are characteristic of Ivanhoe as well. The most notable Robin Hood films are the lavish [[Douglas Fairbanks]] [[Robin Hood (1922 film)|1922 silent film]], the 1938 triple Academy Award-winning [[The Adventures of Robin Hood (film)|''Adventures of Robin Hood'']] with Errol Flynn as Robin (which contemporary reviewer Frank Nugent links specifically with ''Ivanhoe''<ref>{{cite news |last=Nugent |first=Frank S. |title=The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) |department=Reviews |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 May 1939 |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173FB72CA0494CC5B67994886896 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715171815/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173FB72CA0494CC5B67994886896 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 July 2012 }}</ref>), and the 1991 box-office success ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'' with Kevin Costner). There is also the [[Mel Brooks]] spoof, [[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]. In most versions of Robin Hood, both Ivanhoe and Robin, for instance, are returning Crusaders. They have quarrelled with their respective fathers, they are proud to be Saxons, they display a highly evolved sense of justice, they support the rightful king even though he is of Norman-French ancestry, they are adept with weapons, and they each fall in love with a \"fair maid\" (Rowena and Marian, respectively).\n\nThis particular time-frame was popularised by Scott. He borrowed it from the writings of the 16th-century chronicler [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]] or a 17th-century [[ballad]] presumably to make the plot of his novel more gripping. Medieval balladeers had generally placed Robin about two centuries later in the reign of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], [[Edward II of England|II]] or [[Edward III of England|III]].\n\nRobin's familiar feat of splitting his competitor's arrow in an archery contest appears for the first time in ''Ivanhoe''.\n\n===Historical accuracy===\nThe general political events depicted in the novel are relatively accurate; the novel tells of the period just after King Richard's imprisonment in Austria following the Crusade and of his return to England after a ransom is paid. Yet the story is also heavily fictionalised. Scott himself acknowledged that he had taken liberties with history in his \"Dedicatory Epistle\" to ''Ivanhoe''. Modern readers are cautioned{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} to understand that Scott's aim was to create a compelling novel set in a historical period, not to provide a book of history.\n\nThere has been criticism of Scott's portrayal of the bitter extent of the \"enmity of Saxon and Norman, represented as persisting in the days of Richard\" as \"unsupported by the evidence of contemporary records that forms the basis of the story.\"<ref>\"Ivanhoe\", page 499. ''The Oxford Companion to English Literature'', 1989</ref> However, Scott may have intended to suggest parallels between the [[Norman conquest of England]], about 130 years previously, and the prevailing situation in Scott's native Scotland ([[Acts of Union 1707|Scotland's union with England in 1707]] \u2013 about the same length of time had elapsed before Scott's writing and the resurgence in his time of Scottish nationalism evidenced by the cult of [[Robert Burns]], the famous poet who deliberately chose to work in Scots vernacular though he was an educated man and spoke modern English eloquently).<ref>{{cite news |last=Linklater |first=Andro |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/3275251/freedom-and-houghmagandie.thtml |title=Freedom and Haughmagandie |department=Book Review |newspaper=The Spectator |date=24 January 2009 |accessdate=18 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203125513/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/3275251/freedom-and-houghmagandie.thtml |archive-date=3 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Indeed, some experts suggest that Scott deliberately used ''Ivanhoe'' to illustrate his own combination of Scottish patriotism and pro-British Unionism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/16/walter-scott-edinburgh-book-festival |title=Scotland's image-maker Sir Walter Scott 'invented English legends' |last=Higgins |first=Charlotte |newspaper=The Guardian |date=16 August 2010 |accessdate=18 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Stuart |title=Scott-land: The Man who Invented a Nation |year=2010 |publisher=Polygon |isbn=978-1846971792 }}</ref>\n\nThe novel generated a new name in English \u2013 [[Cedric]]. The original Saxon name had been ''[[Cerdic]]'' but Sir Walter misspelled it \u2013 an example of [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]]. \"It is not a name but a misspelling\" said satirist [[H. H. Munro]].\n\nIn England in 1194, it would have been unlikely for Rebecca to face the threat of being [[burned at the stake]] on charges of [[witchcraft]]. It is thought that it was shortly afterwards, from the 1250s, that the Church began to undertake [[witch hunt|the finding and punishment of witches]] and death did not become the usual penalty until the 15th century. Even then, the form of execution used for witches in England was hanging, burning being reserved for those also convicted of [[treason]]. There are various minor errors, e.g. the description of the tournament at Ashby owes more to the 14th century, most of the coins mentioned by Scott are exotic, [[William II of England|William Rufus]] is said to have been John Lackland's grandfather, but he was actually his great-great-uncle, and Wamba (disguised as a monk) says \"I am a poor brother of the Order of St Francis\", but [[St. Francis of Assisi]] only began his preaching ten years after the death of Richard I.\n\n\"For a writer whose early novels were prized for their historical accuracy, Scott was remarkably loose with the facts when he wrote Ivanhoe... But it is crucial to remember that Ivanhoe, unlike the Waverly books, is entirely a romance. It is meant to please, not to instruct, and is more an act of imagination than one of research. Despite this fancifulness, however, Ivanhoe does make some prescient historical points. The novel is occasionally quite critical of King Richard, who seems to love adventure more than he loves the well-being of his subjects. This criticism did not match the typical idealised, romantic view of Richard the Lion-Hearted that was popular when Scott wrote the book, and yet it accurately echoes the way King Richard is often judged by historians today.\"<ref>{{cite web |publisher=SparkNotes |date= |url=http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ivanhoe/section11.rhtml |title=Analytical overview: Ivanhoe |accessdate=18 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nRebecca may be based on [[Rebecca Gratz]],<ref name=\"baumgold19710322\">{{Cite magazine |last=Baumgold |first=Julie |date=22 March 1971 |title=The Persistence of the Jewish American Princess |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRSTXb3fuRgC&lpg=PA25&pg=PA25#v=onepage&f=true |magazine=New York |pages=25\u201331}}</ref> a Philadelphia teacher and philanthropist and the first Jewish female college student in America.

The net charge on the molecule is affected by pH of its surrounding environment and can become more positively or negatively charged due to the gain or loss, respectively, of [[protons#In Physics and biochemistry|protons]] (H<sup>+</sup>).\n\nSurfaces naturally charge to form a [[double layer (interfacial)|double layer]]. In the common case when the surface charge-determining ions are H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>\u2212</sup>, the net surface charge is affected by the pH of the liquid in which the solid is submerged.\n\nThe pI value can affect the solubility of a molecule at a given pH. Such molecules have minimum [[solubility]] in water or salt solutions at the pH that corresponds to their '''pI''' and often [[precipitate]] out of [[solution]].  Biological amphoteric molecules such as [[protein]]s contain both acidic and basic [[functional groups]]. Amino acids that make up proteins may be positive, negative, neutral, or polar in nature, and together give a protein its overall charge. At a [[pH]] below their pI, proteins carry a net positive charge; above their pI they carry a net negative charge. Proteins can, thus, be separated by net charge in a [[polyacrylamide gel]] using either [[QPNC-PAGE|preparative gel electrophoresis]], which uses a constant pH to separate proteins or [[isoelectric focusing]], which uses a pH gradient to separate proteins. Isoelectric focusing is also the first step in [[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis|2-D gel polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]].\n\nIn biomolecules, proteins can be separated by [[Ion chromatography|ion exchange chromatography]]. Biological proteins are made up of [[zwitterion]]ic amino acid compounds; the net charge of these proteins can be positive or negative depending on the pH of the environment. The specific pI of the target protein can be used to model the process around and the compound can then be purified from the rest of the mixture. Buffers of various pH can be used for this purification process to change the pH of the environment. When a mixture containing a target protein is loaded into an ion exchanger, the stationary matrix can be either positively-charged (for mobile anions) or negatively-charged (for mobile cations). At low pH values, the net charge of most proteins in the mixture is positive - in cation exchangers, these positively-charged proteins bind to the negatively-charged matrix. At high pH values, the net charge of most proteins is negative, where they bind to the positively-charged matrix in anion exchangers. When the environment is at a pH value equal to the protein's pI, the net charge is zero, and the protein is not bound to any exchanger, and therefore, can be eluted out.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dayton|first=W.

If the [[pH]] of the buffer is above the pI of the protein being run, the [[protein]] will migrate to the positive pole (negative charge is attracted to a positive pole).  If the [[pH]] of the buffer is below the pI of the [[protein]] being run, the [[protein]] will migrate to the negative pole of the gel (positive charge is attracted to the negative pole).  If the [[protein]] is run with a buffer pH that is equal to the pI, it will not migrate at all. This is also true for individual amino acids.\n\n=== Examples ===\n{|style=\"float: right; border: 1px solid #BBB; margin: .46em 0 0 .2em;\"\n|-\n|[[File:Glycine pI.png|250px]]\n\n|[[File:AMP pI.png|250px]]\n|-\n|align=center|glycine pK = 2.72, 9.60\n|align=center|adenosine monophosphate pK = 0.9, 3.8, 6.1\n|}\nIn the two examples (on the right) the isoelectric point is shown by the green vertical line.

The surface charge of the mixed oxides was correlated with acidity. Greater titania content led to increased Lewis acidity, whereas zirconia-rich oxides displayed Br::onsted acidity. The different types of acidities produced differences in ion adsorption rates and capacities.\n\n== Isoelectric point versus point of zero charge ==\nThe terms isoelectric point (IEP) and [[point of zero charge]] (PZC) are often used interchangeably, although under certain circumstances, it may be productive to make the distinction.\n\nIn systems in which H<sup>+</sup>/OH<sup>&minus;</sup> are the interface potential-determining ions, the point of zero charge is given in terms of pH. The pH at which the surface exhibits a neutral net electrical charge is the point of zero charge at the surface. [[Electrokinetic phenomena]] generally measure [[zeta potential]], and a zero zeta potential is interpreted as the point of zero net charge at the [[Electrical double layer|shear plane]]. This is termed the isoelectric point.<ref>A.W. Adamson, A.P. Gast, \"Physical Chemistry of Surfaces\", John Wiley and Sons, 1997.</ref> Thus, the isoelectric point is the value of pH at which the colloidal particle remains stationary in an electrical field. The isoelectric point is expected to be somewhat different than the point of zero charge at the particle surface, but this difference is often ignored in practice for so-called pristine surfaces, i.e., surfaces with no [[adsorption|specifically adsorbed]] positive or negative charges.<ref name=\"ref2pineapple\" /> In this context, specific adsorption is understood as adsorption occurring in a [[Double layer (interfacial)|Stern layer]] or [[chemisorption]]. Thus, point of zero charge at the surface is taken as equal to isoelectric point in the absence of specific adsorption on that surface.\n\nAccording to Jolivet,<ref name=\"Jolivet\">Jolivet J.P., ''Metal Oxide Chemistry and Synthesis. From Solution to Solid State'', John Wiley & Sons Ltd. 2000, {{ISBN|0-471-97056-5}}  (English translation of the original French text, ''De la Solution \u00e0 l'Oxyde'', InterEditions et CNRS Editions, Paris, 1994).</ref> in the absence of positive or negative charges, the surface is best described by the point of zero charge. If positive and negative charges are both present in equal amounts, then this is the isoelectric point. Thus, the PZC refers to the absence of any type of surface charge, while the IEP refers to a state of neutral net surface charge. The difference between the two, therefore, is the quantity of charged sites at the point of net zero charge. Jolivet uses the intrinsic surface equilibrium constants, p''K''<sup>&minus;</sup> and p''K''<sup>+</sup> to define the two conditions in terms of the relative number of charged sites:\n\n:<math> \\mathrm{p}K^- - \\mathrm{p}K^+ = \\Delta \\mathrm{p}K = \\log {\\frac{\\left[\\mathrm{MOH}\\right]^2}{\\left[\\mathrm{MOH}{_2^+}\\right]\\left[\\mathrm{MO}^-\\right]}} </math>\n\nFor large \u0394p''K'' (>4 according to Jolivet), the predominant species is MOH while there are relatively few charged species - so the PZC is relevant.  For small values of \u0394p''K'', there are many charged species in approximately equal numbers, so one speaks of the IEP.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Henderson-Hasselbalch equation]]\n* [[Isoelectric focusing]]\n* [[Isoionic point]]\n* [[PKa|pK acid dissociation constant]]\n* [[QPNC-PAGE]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* Nelson DL, Cox MM (2004).

Therefore, some foreign issue reply coupons that are tendered for redemption may bear the name of the issuing country (generally in French) rather than the optional control stamp or postmark.\n\nThe Nairobi Model was an international reply coupon printed by the Universal Postal Union which is approximately 3.75 inches by 6 inches and had an expiration date of December 31, 2013. This model was designed by Rob Van Goor, a graphic artist from the Luxembourg Post. It was selected from among 10 designs presented by Universal Postal Union member countries. Van Goor interpreted the theme of the contest \u2013 \"The Postage Stamp: A Vehicle for Exchange\" \u2013 by depicting the world being cradled by a hand and the perforated outline of a postage stamp.\n\nThe Doha Model is named for the 25th UPU congress held in Doha, Qatar, in 2012. The Doha model, designed by Czech artist and graphic designer Michal Sindelar, shows cupped hands catching a stream of water, to celebrate the theme of Water for Life. It expires after December 31, 2017.\n\nThe Istanbul Model was designed by graphic artist Nguyen Du's and features a pair of hands and a dove against an Arctic backdrop to represent sustainable development in the postal sector. Ten countries participated in the competition which was held Oct. 7, 2016, during the UPU congress in Istanbul, Turkey. It expires after December 31, 2021.\n\nThe United States Postal Service stopped selling international reply coupons on January 27, 2013.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Heys Collection]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|International reply coupons}}\n* [http://www.upu.int/en/activities/international-reply-coupons/about-irc.html UPU IRC info]\n* [http://www.upu.int/en/activities/international-reply-coupons/countries-selling-ircs.html UPU list of countries selling IRCs]\n* [http://www.n6hb.org/s-a/irc.htm IRC info]\n* [http://www.ad1c.us/upu_rules_irc.htm Some IRC illustrations and exchange guidelines]\n* [http://www.dxzone.com/catalog/DX_Resources/QSLing/International_reply_coupons/ International Reply Coupons and Ham Radio]\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:International Reply Coupon}}\n[[Category:Universal Postal Union]]\n[[Category:Postal stationery]]\n[[Category:Philatelic terminology]]", "sha1": "7h9f80qdtt1nxi1yymdlll0kldcmcy7"}}, {"title": "Isaac Bonewits", "ns": "0", "id": "15059", "revision": {"id": "864830278", "parentid": "852643949", "timestamp": "2018-10-19T19:09:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "GetMeOuttaHere", "id": "34933729"}, "comment": "Added information that has come to light in a book entitled \"The Last Closet: The Dark Side of Avalon\" that is very unsavory but that people should know", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "\n{{expert needed|Neopaganism|date=December 2009}}\n\n\n{{Infobox person\n| name=Phillip Emmons Isaac Bonewits\n| image=Isaac Bonewits 2004.png\n| image_size=250\n| caption=Isaac Bonewits in 2004\n| birth_date={{birth date|1949|10|1}}\n| birth_place= Royal Oak, MI\n| death_date={{Death date and age|2010|08|12|1949|10|1}}\n| death_place= Valley Cottage, NY\n| occupation=\n| main interests=\n| spouse= Phaedra Bonewits (m. 2007)\n| children= Arthur Shaffrey Lipp-Bonewits\n| salary=\n| website=http://www.neopagan.net\n}}\n\n'''Phillip Emmons Isaac Bonewits''' (October 1, 1949 &ndash; August 12, 2010<ref name=WVObit>{{cite web|url=http://www.witchvox.com/wren/wn_detail.html?id=22549|title=Isaac Bonewits (1949 - 2010) : A Tribute|accessdate=January 19, 2012|first=Peg|last=Aloi|work=Witchvox|date=August 12, 2010}}</ref>) was an American [[Neo-druidry|Druid]] who published a number of books on the subject of [[Neopaganism]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].

His fourth wife was author [[Deborah Lipp]], from 1988 to 1998. On July 23, 2004, he was married in a [[Handfasting (Neopaganism)|handfasting]] ceremony to a former vice-president of the Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans, Phaedra Heyman Bonewits. At the time of the handfasting, the marriage was not yet legal because he had not yet been legally divorced from Lipp, although they had been separated for several years.

Bonewits was ordained as a [[Neo-druidism|Neo-druid]] [[priest]] in 1969. During this period, the 18-year-old Bonewits was recruited by the [[Church of Satan]],<ref name=Guiley/> but left due to political and philosophical conflicts with [[Anton LaVey]]. During his stint in the Church of Satan, Bonewits appeared in some scenes of the 1970 documentary ''[[Satanis|Satanis: The Devil's Mass]]''.<ref name=\"imdb\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063550/|work=Internet Movie Database|title=Satanis|accessdate=Jan 19, 2012}}</ref> Bonewits, in his article \"My Satanic Adventure\", asserts that the rituals in ''Satanis'' were staged for the movie at the behest of the filmmakers and were not authentic ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bonewits|first=Isaac|url=http://www.neopagan.net/SatanicAdventure.html|title=My Satanic Adventure|accessdate=Jan 19, 2012|year=2005}}</ref>\n\n===Author and Druid===\nHis first book, ''Real Magic'', was published in 1972. Between 1973 and 1975 Bonewits was employed as editor of ''Gnostica'' magazine in Minnesota (published by [[Llewellyn Publications]]), established an offshoot group of the RDNA called the Schismatic Druids of North America, and helped create a group called the Hasidic Druids of North America (despite his lifelong status as a \"[[gentile]]\"). He also founded the short-lived Aquarian Anti-Defamation League (AADL), an early Pagan civil rights group.<ref name=\"Guiley\" />\n\nIn 1976, Bonewits moved back to Berkeley and rejoined his original grove there, now part of the New Reformed Druids of North America (NRDNA). He was later elected Archdruid of the Berkeley Grove.<ref name=\"Guiley\" />\n\n===Founder of \u00c1r nDra\u00edocht F\u00e9in===\n\nOver the years Bonewits also had varying degrees of involvement with mystical organizations such as  [[Ordo Templi Orientis]], [[Gardnerian Wicca]], and the [[New Reformed Orthodox Order of the Golden Dawn]] (a [[Wicca]]n organization not to be confused with the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) as well as others.<ref name=\"A Brief Biography of Isaac Bonewits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.neopagan.net/IB_Bio.html|title=Isaac Bonewits' Biography|first=Isaac|last=Bonewits|website=www.neopagan.net}}</ref><!-- This ref needs to be carefully vetted.

He promoted his book 'Authentic Thaumaturgy' to gamers as a way of organizing [[Dungeons and Dragons]] games and to give a background to games of [[Magic: the Gathering]].\n\nIn 1983, Bonewits founded [[\u00c1r nDra\u00edocht F\u00e9in]] (also known as \"A Druid Fellowship\" or ADF), which was incorporated in 1990 in the state of [[Delaware]] as a U.S. 501(c)3 non-profit organization. He made the organization's first public announcement in 1984, and began the membership sign-up at the first [[Association for Consciousness Exploration|WinterStar Symposium]] in 1984. Since that time, ADF has developed into one of the world's largest forms of contemporary Druidism practiced as a religion.\n\nAlthough illness curtailed many of his activities and travels for a time, he remained Archdruid of ADF until 1996. In that year, he resigned from the position of Archdruid but retained the lifelong title of ADF Archdruid Emeritus.\n\n===Musician and activist===\nA songwriter, singer, and recording artist, he produced two CDs of pagan music and numerous recorded lectures and panel discussions, produced and distributed by the [[Association for Consciousness Exploration]]. He lived in [[Rockland County, New York]], and was a member of the [[Covenant of Unitarian Universalist Pagans]] (CUUPS).\n\nBonewits encouraged charity programs to help Neopagan seniors,<ref name=\"fn_1\">{{cite web|last=Bonewits|first=Isaac|url=http://www.neopagan.net/Adopt-an-Elder.html|title=Adopt an Elder|accessdate=January 19, 2012|year=2009}}</ref> and in January 2006 was the keynote speaker at the Conference On Current Pagan Studies at the [[Claremont Graduate University]] in [[Claremont, California|Claremont, CA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://paganconference.com/past-keynote-speakers/|title=Conference on Current Pagan Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Illness and death==\nIn 1990, Bonewits was diagnosed with [[Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome]].

He died at home, on August 12, 2010, surrounded by his family.<ref name=WVObit/>\n\n==Contributions to Neopaganism==\nIn his book ''Real Magic'' (1971), Bonewits proposed his \"Laws of Magic.\" These \"laws\" are synthesized from a multitude of [[belief system]]s from around the world to explain and categorize magical beliefs within a cohesive framework. Many interrelationships exist, and some belief systems are [[subset]]s of others. This work was chosen by [[Dennis Wheatley]] in the 1970s to be part of his publishing project 'Library of the Occult'.\n\nBonewits also coined much of the modern terminology used to articulate the themes and issues that affect the North American Neopagan community.\n* Pioneered the modern usage of the terms \"[[thealogy]],\" \"[[Paleo-Paganism]],\" \"[[Meso-Paganism]],\" and numerous other [[retronym]]s.\n* Possibly coined the term \"[[Polytheistic reconstructionism|Pagan Reconstructionism]],\" though the communities in question would later diverge from his initial meaning.<ref name=\"recon\">{{cite book | first =Isaac | last =Bonewits | authorlink = | year =2006 | title =Bonewits's Essential Guide to Druidism  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | pages =131 | publisher =Kensington/Citadel | location =New York| isbn =0-8065-2710-2 }} Author is unsure whether he \"got this use of the term from one or more of the other culturally focused Neopagan movements of the time, or if [he] just applied it in a novel fashion.\"</ref><ref name=\"McColman\">McColman (2003) p.51: \"Such reconstructionists are attempting, through both spiritual and scholarly means, to create as purely Celtic a spirituality as possible.\"</ref>\n* Founded [[Ar nDraiocht Fein]], which was incorporated in 1990 in the state of Delaware as a U.S. 501(c)3 non-profit organization.\n* Developed the ''Advanced Bonewits Cult Danger Evaluation Frame'' (ABCDEF).\n* Coined the phrase \"Never Again the Burning.\"<ref name=\"natb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.neopagan.net/AquarianManifesto.html|title=The Aquarian Manifesto with Historical Notes|first=Isaac|last=Bonewits|website=www.neopagan.net}}</ref>\n* Critiqued the [[Witch-cult hypothesis|Burning Times / Old Religion Murray thesis]] (in ''Bonewits's Essential Guide to Witchcraft and Wicca'').\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn 2017, Moira Greyland published a book entitled \"The Last Closet:  The Dark Side of Avalon\".  In it she recounts a harrowing tale of a childhood with two parents who sexually abused both her and her brother.

The initial specified clock frequency limit was 2&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]], and with common instructions using 4, 5, 7, 10, or 11 cycles this meant that it operated at a typical speed of a few hundred thousand [[instructions per second]]. A faster variant 8080A-1 became available later with clock frequency limit up to 3.125&nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]].\n\nThe 8080 requires two support chips to function in most applications, the i8224 clock generator/driver and the i8228 bus controller, and it is implemented in [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] using non-saturated [[Depletion and enhancement modes|enhancement mode]] transistors as loads <ref>similar to ''[[pull-up resistor]]s''</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Tohya|first1=Hirokazu|title=Switching Mode Circuit Analysis and Design: Innovative Methodology by Novel Solitary Electromagnetic Wave Theory|date=2013|publisher=Bentham Science Publishers|isbn=9781608054497|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ILceDgAAQBAJ&pg=PA4&dq=8080+non-saturated+enhancement|language=en}}</ref> therefore demanding a +12&nbsp;[[Volt|V]] and a \u22125&nbsp;V voltage in addition to the main [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]]-compatible +5&nbsp;V.\n\nAlthough earlier microprocessors were used for [[calculator]]s, [[cash register]]s, [[computer terminal]]s, [[industrial robot]]s,<ref>The [[Intel 8008|8008]] (1972) was used for interpolation and control in ASEA's (now ABB) first line of general industrial robots, introduced October 1973.</ref> and other applications, the 8080 became one of the first really widespread microprocessors. Several factors contributed to its popularity: its 40-pin package made it easier to interface than the 18-pin 8008, and also made its data bus more efficient; its NMOS implementation gave it faster transistors than those of the [[PMOS logic|PMOS]] 8008, while also simplifying interfacing by making it [[transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL-compatible]]; a wider variety of support chips was available; its instruction set was enhanced over the 8008;<ref>The enhancements were largely based on customer feedback and Federico Faggin and others listening to minicomputer-oriented professionals about certain problems and lack of features in the 8008 architecture. (Source: 8008 and 8080 oral histories.)</ref> and its full 16-bit address bus (versus the 14-bit one of the 8008) enabled it to access 64&nbsp;KB of memory, four times more than the 8008's range of 16&nbsp;KB. It became the engine of the [[Altair 8800]], and subsequent [[S-100 bus]] personal computers, until it was replaced by the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] in this role, and was the original target CPU for [[CP/M]] operating systems developed by [[Gary Kildall]].\n\nThe 8080 was successful enough that compatibility at the [[assembly language]] level became a design requirement for the [[Intel 8086|8086]] when design for it was started in 1976. This also means that the 8080 directly influenced the ubiquitous 32-bit and 64-bit [[x86]] architectures of today.\n\n==Description==\n\n===Programming model===\n[[Image:Intel 8080 arch.svg|right|thumb|i8080 microarchitecture]]\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:smaller\"\n|+ Intel 8080 registers\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>1</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>9</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>8</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>7</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>6</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>5</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>4</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>3</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>2</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>1</sub>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| <sup>0</sup><sub>0</sub>\n| ''(bit position)''\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Main registers''' <br/>\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| A\n| style=\"text-align:center;background:#DDD\" colspan=\"8\"| Flags\n| style=\"width:auto; background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''S'''tatus '''W'''ord\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| B\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| C\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''B'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| D\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| E\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''D'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| H\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"| L\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''H''' (indirect address)\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Index registers''' <br/>\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"16\"| SP\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''S'''tack '''P'''ointer\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Program counter''' <br/>\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"16\"| PC\n| style=\"background:white; color:black;\"| '''P'''rogram '''C'''ounter\n|- \n|colspan=\"17\" | '''Status register'''\n|- style=\"background:silver;color:black\"\n| style=\"text-align:center; background:white\" colspan=\"8\" | &nbsp;\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Sign flag|S]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Zero flag|Z]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Half-carry flag|AC]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Parity flag|P]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| -\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Carry flag|C]]\n| style=\"background:white; color:black\" | Flags\n|}\n\nThe Intel 8080 is the successor to the [[Intel 8008|8008]]. It uses the same basic [[instruction set]] and [[Processor register|register]] model as the 8008 (developed by [[Computer Terminal Corporation]]), even though it is not [[Source-code compatibility|source-code compatible]] nor [[binary-code compatibility|binary-compatible]] with its predecessor. Every instruction in the 8008 has an equivalent instruction in the 8080 (even though the actual opcodes differ between the two CPUs). The 8080 also adds a few 16-bit operations in its instruction set as well. Whereas the 8008 required the use of the HL register pair to indirectly access its 14-bit memory space, the 8080 added addressing modes to allow direct access to its full 16-bit memory space. In addition, the internal 7-level push-down [[call stack]] of the 8008 was replaced by a dedicated 16-bit stack-pointer (SP) register. The 8080's large 40-pin [[dual in-line package|DIP packaging]] permits it to provide a 16-bit [[address bus]] and an 8-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]], allowing easy access to 64&nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KB]] of memory.\n\n====Registers====\nThe processor has seven 8-bit [[processor register|registers]] (A, B, C, D, E, H, and L), where A is the primary 8-bit accumulator, and the other six registers can be used as either individual 8-bit registers or as three 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, and HL, referred to as B, D and H in Intel documents) depending on the particular instruction. Some instructions also enable the HL register pair to be used as a (limited) 16-bit accumulator, and a pseudo-register M can be used almost anywhere that any other register can be used, referring to the memory address pointed to by the HL pair. It also has a 16-bit [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack pointer]] to memory (replacing the 8008's internal [[stack (data structure)|stack]]), and a 16-bit [[program counter]].\n\n====Flags====\nThe processor maintains internal [[flag word|flag bits]] (a [[status register]]), which indicate the results of arithmetic and logical instructions. The flags are:\n* [[Sign flag|Sign]] (S), set if the result is negative.\n* [[Zero flag|Zero]] (Z), set if the result is zero.\n* [[Parity flag|Parity]] (P), set if the number of 1 bits in the result is even.\n* [[Carry flag|Carry]] (C), set if the last addition operation resulted in a carry or if the last subtraction operation required a borrow\n* [[Half-carry flag|Auxiliary carry]] (AC or H), used for [[binary-coded decimal]] arithmetic (BCD).\n\nThe carry bit can be set or complemented by specific instructions. Conditional-branch instructions test the various flag status bits. The flags can be copied as a group to the accumulator. The A accumulator and the flags together are called the PSW register, or program status word.\n\n====Commands/instructions====\nAs with many other 8-bit processors, all instructions are encoded in a single byte (including register numbers, but excluding immediate data), for simplicity. Some of them are followed by one or two bytes of data, which can be an immediate operand, a memory address, or a port number. Like larger processors, it has automatic CALL and RET instructions for multi-level procedure calls and returns (which can even be conditionally executed, like jumps) and instructions to save and restore any 16-bit register pair on the machine stack. There are also eight one-byte call instructions ({{code|RST}}) for subroutines located at the fixed addresses 00h, 08h, 10h, ..., 38h. These were intended to be supplied by external hardware in order to invoke a corresponding [[interrupt service routine]], but were also often employed as fast [[system call]]s. The most sophisticated command is {{code|XTHL}}, which is used for exchanging the register pair HL with the value stored at the address indicated by the stack pointer.\n\n=====8-bit instructions=====\nMost 8-bit operations can only be performed on the 8-bit [[Accumulator (computing)|accumulator]] (the A register). For 8-bit operations with two operands, the other operand can be either an immediate value, another 8-bit register, or a memory byte addressed by the 16-bit register pair HL. Direct copying is supported between any two 8-bit registers and between any 8-bit register and an HL-addressed memory byte. Due to the regular encoding of the {{code|MOV}} instruction (using a quarter of available opcode space), there are redundant codes to copy a register into itself ({{code|MOV B,B}}, for instance), which were of little use, except for delays. However, what would have been a copy from the HL-addressed cell into itself (i.e., {{code|MOV M,M}}) is instead used to encode the halt ([[HLT (x86 instruction)|{{code|HLT}}]]) instruction, halting execution until an external reset or interrupt occurs.\n\n=====16-bit operations=====\nAlthough the 8080 is generally an 8-bit processor, it also has limited abilities to perform 16-bit operations: Any of the three 16-bit register pairs (BC, DE, or HL, referred to as B, D, H in Intel documents) or SP can be loaded with an immediate 16-bit value (using {{code|LXI}}), incremented or decremented (using {{code|INX}} and {{code|DCX}}), or added to HL (using {{code|DAD}}). The {{code|XCHG}}<ref>[http://www.classiccmp.org/dunfield/r/8080.txt 8080 instruction encoding]. ClassicCMP.org. Retrieved on October 23, 2011.</ref> instruction exchanges the values of the HL and DE register pairs. By adding HL to itself, it is possible to achieve the same result as a 16-bit arithmetical left shift with one instruction. The only 16-bit instructions that affect any flag are {{code|DAD H/D/B}}, which set the CY (carry) flag in order to allow for programmed 24-bit or 32-bit [[arithmetic]] (or larger), needed to implement [[floating-point arithmetic]]s, for instance.\n\n===Input/output scheme===\n\n====Input output port space====\nThe 8080 supports up to 256<ref>Note: Some Intel datasheets from the 1970s advertise 512 I/O ports, because they count input and output ports separately.</ref> [[input/output]] (I/O) ports, accessed via dedicated I/O instructions taking port addresses as operands. This I/O mapping scheme was regarded as an advantage, as it freed up the processor's limited address space. Many CPU architectures instead use so-called [[memory-mapped I/O]], in which a common address space is used for both RAM and peripheral chips. This removes the need for dedicated I/O instructions, although a drawback in such designs may be that special hardware must be used to insert wait states, as peripherals are often slower than memory. However, in some simple 8080 computers, I/O was indeed addressed as if they were memory cells, \"memory-mapped\", leaving the I/O commands unused. I/O addressing could also sometimes employ the fact that the processor would output the same 8-bit port address to both the lower and the higher address byte (i.e. {{code|IN 05h}} would put the address 0505h on the 16-bit address bus). Similar I/O-port schemes were used in the backward-compatible Zilog Z80 and Intel 8085, as well as the closely related x86 families of microprocessors.\n\n====Separate stack space====\nOne of the bits in the processor state word (see below) indicates that the processor is accessing data from the stack. Using this signal, it is possible to implement a separate stack memory space. However, this feature was seldom used.\n\n===The internal state word===\nFor more advanced systems, during one phase of its working loop, the processor set its \"internal state byte\" on the data bus. This byte contains flags that determine whether the memory or I/O port is accessed and whether it is necessary to handle an interrupt.\n\nThe interrupt system state (enabled or disabled) is also output on a separate pin. For simple systems, where the interrupts are not used, it is possible to find cases where this pin is used as an additional single-bit output port (the popular [[Radio-86RK]] computer made in the [[Soviet Union]], for instance).\n\n===Example code===\nThe following 8080/8085 [[assembly language|assembler]] source code is for a subroutine named <code>memcpy</code> that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations.\n\n<!--NOTE: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU-->\n<!--NOTE: But it should be correct.-->\n{|\n|\n<pre>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1000\n1000\n1000  78\n1001  B1\n1002  C8\n1003  1A\n1004  77\n1005  13\n1006  23\n1007  0B\n1008  78\n1009  B1\n100A  C2 03 10\n100D  C9\n</pre>\n|\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; memcpy --\n; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n;\n; Entry registers\n;       BC - Number of bytes to copy\n;       DE - Address of source data block\n;       HL - Address of target data block\n;\n; Return registers\n;       BC - Zero\n\n            org     1000h       ;Origin at 1000h\nmemcpy      public\n            mov     a,b         ;Test BC,\n            ora     c           ;If BC = 0,\n            rz                  ;Return\nloop:       ldax    d           ;Load A from (DE)\n            mov     m,a         ;Store A into (HL)\n            inx     d           ;Increment DE\n            inx     h           ;Increment HL\n            dcx     b           ;Decrement BC (does not affect Flags)\n            mov     a,b         ;Test for done\n            ora     c           ;B | C = 0 and done\n            jnz     loop        ;Repeat loop until BC = 0\n            ret\n</source>\n|}\n\n===Pin usage===\nThe address bus has its own 16 pins, and the data bus has 8 pins that are usable without any multiplexing. Using the two additional pins (read and write signals), it is possible to assemble simple microprocessor devices very easily. Only the separate IO space, interrupts and DMA require additional chips to decode the processor pin signals. However, the processor load capacity is limited, and even simple computers frequently contained bus amplifiers.\n\nThe processor requires three power sources (\u22125, +5 and +12&nbsp;V) and two non-overlapping high-amplitude synchronization signals. However, at least the late Soviet version \u041a\u0420580\u0412\u041c80\u0410 was able to work with a single +5&nbsp;V power source, the +12&nbsp;V pin being connected to +5&nbsp;V and the \u22125&nbsp;V pin to ground. The processor consumes about 1.3&nbsp;[[Watt|W]] of power.\n\nThe pin-out table, from the chip's accompanying documentation, describes the pins as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n ! Pin number\n ! Signal\n ! Type\n ! Comment\n |-\n | 1 || A10\n | Output || Address bus 10\n |-\n | 2 || GND\n | \u2014 || Ground\n |-\n | 3 || D4\n | rowspan=\"8\" | Bidirectional\n | rowspan=\"8\" | Bidirectional data bus. The processor also transiently sets here the \"processor state\", providing information about what the processor is currently doing:\n*D0 reading interrupt command. In response to the interrupt signal, the processor is reading and executing a single arbitrary command with this flag raised. Normally the supporting chips provide the subroutine call command (CALL or RST), transferring control to the interrupt handling code.\n*D1 reading (low level means writing)\n*D2 accessing stack (probably a separate stack memory space was initially planned)\n*D3 doing nothing, has been halted by the [[HLT (x86 instruction)|HLT]] instruction\n*D4 writing data to an output port\n*D5 reading the first byte of an executable instruction\n*D6 reading data from an input port\n*D7 reading data from memory\n |-\n | 4 || D5\n |-\n | 5 || D6\n |-\n | 6 || D7\n |-\n | 7 || D3\n |-\n | 8 || D2\n |-\n | 9 || D1\n |-\n | 10 || D0\n |-\n | 11 || \u22125 V\n | \u2014 || The \u22125 V power supply.

The various bits of this state word provide additional information for supporting the separate address and memory spaces, interrupts, and direct memory access. This signal is required to pass through additional logic before it can be used to write the processor state word from the data bus into some external register, e.g. [http://www.datasheets360.com/pdf/-4828066515233335508 8238]-System Controller and Bus Driver.\n |-\n | 20 || +5 V || \u2014 || The + 5&nbsp;V power supply\n |-\n | 21 || HLDA\n | Output || Direct memory access confirmation.

It was manufactured in a [[silicon gate]] process using a minimal feature size of 6&nbsp;\u00b5m. A single layer of metal is used to [[Electrical connection|interconnect]] the approximately 6,000 [[transistor]]s<ref>[http://museum.reichel-orbital.de/index.php?page=cpus Reichel-Orbital museum \u2013 CPU Collection].

Retrieved on October 23, 2011.</ref> in the design, but the higher [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] [[Polycrystalline silicon|polysilicon]] layer, which required higher voltage for some interconnects, is implemented with transistor gates. The [[Die preparation|die]] size was approximately 20&nbsp;mm<sup>2</sup>.\n\n==The industrial impact==\n\n===Applications and successors===\n{{anchor|8080_CPU_family}}\nThe 8080 is used in many early microcomputers, such as the [[Altair 8800|MITS Altair 8800]] Computer, [[Processor Technology]] [[SOL-20]] Terminal Computer and [[IMSAI 8080]] Microcomputer, forming the basis for machines running the [[CP/M]] operating system (the later, almost fully compatible and more capable, [[Zilog Z80]] processor would capitalize on this, with Z80 & CP/M becoming the dominant CPU & OS combination of the period circa 1976 to 1983 much as did the [[x86]] & [[MS-DOS]] for the PC a decade later).\n\nEven in 1979 after introduction of the Z80 and 8085 processors, five manufacturers of the 8080 were selling an estimated 500,000 units per month at a price around $3 to $4 per unit.<ref>{{cite news |author=Sol Libes |title=BYTE News |periodical=BYTE Magazine |ISSN=0360-5280 |volume=4 |series=11 |date=November 1979 |page=82}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[single-board computer|single-board microcomputer]]s, such as [[MYCRO-1]] and the ''dyna-micro'' were based on the Intel 8080. One of the early uses of the 8080 was made in the late 1970s by Cubic-Western Data of San Diego, CA in its Automated Fare Collection Systems custom designed for mass transit systems around the world. An early industrial use of the 8080 is as the \"brain\" of the DatagraphiX Auto-COM (Computer Output Microfiche) line of products which takes large amounts of user data from reel-to-reel tape and images it onto microfiche. The Auto-COM instruments also include an entire automated film cutting, processing, washing, and drying sub-system \u2013 quite a feat, both then and in the 21st century, to all be accomplished successfully with only an 8-bit microprocessor running at a clock speed of less than 1&nbsp;MHz with a 64&nbsp;KB memory limit. In addition, several early [[Arcade game|arcade]] video games were built around the 8080 microprocessor, including ''[[Space Invaders]]'', one of the most popular arcade games ever made.\n\nShortly after the launch of the 8080, the [[Motorola 6800]] competing design was introduced, and after that, the [[MOS Technology 6502]] derivative of the 6800.\n\n[[Zilog]] introduced the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]], which has a compatible machine-language instruction set and initially used the same assembly language as the 8080, but for legal reasons, Zilog developed a syntactically-different (but code compatible) alternative assembly language for the Z80. At Intel, the 8080 was followed by the compatible and electrically more elegant [[Intel 8085|8085]].\n\nLater Intel issued the assembly-language compatible (but not binary-compatible) 16-bit [[Intel 8086|8086]] and then the 8/16-bit [[Intel 8088|8088]], which was selected by [[IBM]] for its new [[IBM PC|PC]] to be launched in 1981. Later [[NEC]] made the [[NEC V20]] (an 8088 clone with [[Intel 80186]] instruction set compatibility) which also supports an 8080 emulation mode. This is also supported by NEC's [[NEC V30|V30]] (a similarly enhanced 8086 clone). Thus, the 8080, via its [[instruction set architecture|ISA]], made a lasting impact on computer history.\n\nA number of processors compatible with the Intel 8080A were manufactured in the [[Eastern Bloc]]: the [[KR580VM80A]] (initially marked as KP580\u0418K80) in the [[Soviet Union]], the MCY7880<ref>[http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8080/Poland-MCY7880.html MCY7880\u2014a Polish-made clone of 8080].

When the 8080 was introduced, computer systems were usually created by computer manufacturers such as [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[Hewlett Packard]], or [[IBM]]. A manufacturer would produce  the entire computer, including processor, terminals, and system software such as compilers and operating system. The 8080 was actually designed for just about any application ''except'' a complete computer system. Hewlett Packard developed the [[HP 2640]] series of smart terminals around the 8080. The [[HP 2647]] is a terminal which runs [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]] on the 8080. [[Microsoft]] would market as its founding product the first popular programming language for the 8080, and would later acquire [[DOS]] for the [[IBM Personal Computer|IBM PC]].\n\nThe 8080 and [[Intel 8085|8085]] gave rise to the 8086, which was designed as a [[Source-code compatibility|source compatible]] (although not [[Binary-code compatibility|binary compatible]]) extension of the 8085. This design, in turn, later spawned the [[x86]] family of chips, the basis for most CPUs in use today. Many of the 8080's core machine instructions and concepts, for example, registers named ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'', as well as many of the flags used to control conditional jumps, are still in use in the widespread x86 platform. 8080 Assembler code can still be directly translated into x86 instructions; all of its core elements are still present.\n\nPCs based upon the 8086 design and its successors evolved into workstations and servers of 16, 32 and 64 bits, with advanced memory protection, segmentation, and multiprocessing features, blurring the difference between small and large computers {{OR|date=August 2017}} (the [[Intel 80286|80286]] and [[Intel 80386|80386]]'s [[protected mode]] were important in doing so). The size of chips has grown so that the size and power of large x86 chips is not much different from high end architecture chips{{OR|date=August 2017}}, and a common strategy to produce a very large computer is to network many x86 processors.\n\n==History==\n[[Federico Faggin]], the originator of the 8080 architecture in early 1972, proposed it to Intel's management and pushed for its implementation. He finally got the permission to develop it six months later. [[Federico Faggin|Faggin]] hired [[Masatoshi Shima]] from Japan, who did the detailed design under his direction, using the design methodology for random logic with silicon gate that Faggin had created for the 4000 family. [[Stanley Mazor]] contributed a couple of instructions to the instruction set.\n\n===Patent===\n* {{US patent reference|number=4010449|issue-date=March 1, 1977|inventor=[[Federico Faggin]], [[Masatoshi Shima]], Stanley Mazor|title=MOS computer employing a plurality of separate chips}}\n\n==Cultural impact==\n* [[Asteroid]] [[8080 Intel]] is named as a pun and praise on the name of Intel 8080.<ref>[http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/MPNames.html CFA-harvard.edu].

The device needed several additional [[Integrated circuit|IC]]s to produce a functional computer, in part due to it being packaged in a small 18-pin \"memory package\", which ruled out the use of a separate address bus (Intel was primarily a [[DRAM]] manufacturer at the time).\n\nTwo years later, Intel launched the [[Intel 8080|8080]],<ref group=\"note\">Using non-saturated enhancement-load [[NMOS logic]] (demanding a higher gate voltage for the load-transistor gates).</ref> employing the new 40-pin [[Dual in-line package|DIL package]]s originally developed for [[calculator]] ICs to enable a separate address bus. It has an extended instruction set that is [[source-compatible]] (not [[binary compatible]]) with the 8008<ref >{{Cite web\n  |website=CPU World\n  |title=8080 family\n  |url=http://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/8080/\n}}</ref> and also includes some [[16-bit]] instructions to make programming easier. The 8080 device, was eventually replaced by the [[Depletion-load NMOS logic|depletion-load]]-based [[Intel 8085|8085]] (1977), which sufficed with a single +5&nbsp;V power supply instead of the three different operating voltages of earlier chips.<ref group=\"note\">Made possible with depletion-load nMOS logic (the 8085 was later made using HMOS processing, just like the 8086).</ref> Other well known 8-bit microprocessors that emerged during these years are [[Motorola 6800]] (1974), [[PIC microcontroller|General Instrument PIC16X]] (1975), [[MOS Technology 6502]] (1975), [[Zilog Z80]] (1976), and [[Motorola 6809]] (1978).\n\n===The first x86 design===\n[[File:Intel 8086 CPU Die.JPG|thumb|Intel 8086 CPU die image]]\nThe 8086 project started in May 1976 and was originally intended as a temporary substitute for the ambitious and delayed [[iAPX 432]] project. It was an attempt to draw attention from the less-delayed 16- and 32-bit processors of other manufacturers (such as [[Motorola]], [[Zilog]], and [[National Semiconductor]]) and at the same time to counter the threat from the [[Zilog Z80]] (designed by former Intel employees), which became very successful. Both the architecture and the physical chip were therefore developed rather quickly by a small group of people, and using the same basic [[microarchitecture]] elements and physical implementation techniques as employed for the slightly older [[Intel 8085|8085]] (and for which the 8086 also would function as a continuation).\n\nMarketed as [[Source code compatibility|source compatible]], the 8086 was designed to allow [[assembly language]] for the 8008, 8080, or 8085 to be automatically converted into equivalent (suboptimal) 8086 source code, with little or no hand-editing. The programming model and instruction set is (loosely) based on the 8080 in order to make this possible. However, the 8086 design was expanded to support full 16-bit processing, instead of the fairly limited 16-bit capabilities of the 8080 and 8085.\n\nNew kinds of instructions were added as well; full support for signed integers, base+offset addressing, and self-repeating operations were akin to the [[Z80]] design<ref>[http://www.pcworld.com/article/146957/birth_of_a_standard_the_intel_8086_microprocessor.html Birth of a Standard: The Intel 8086 Microprocessor. Thirty years ago, Intel released the 8086 processor, introducing the x86 architecture that underlies every PC \u2014 Windows, Mac, or Linux \u2014 produced today], PC World, June 17, 2008</ref> but were all made slightly more general in the 8086. Instructions directly supporting [[nested function|nested]] [[ALGOL]]-family languages such as [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] and [[PL/M]] were also added. According to principal architect [[Stephen P. Morse]], this was a result of a more software-centric approach than in the design of earlier Intel processors (the designers had experience working with compiler implementations). Other enhancements included [[microcode]]d multiply and divide instructions and a bus structure better adapted to future coprocessors (such as [[Intel 8087|8087]] and [[Intel 8089|8089]]) and multiprocessor systems.\n\nThe first revision of the instruction set and high level architecture was ready after about three months,<ref group=\"note\" >Rev.0 of the instruction set and architecture was ready in about three months, according to Morse.</ref> and as almost no CAD tools were used, four engineers and 12&nbsp;layout people were simultaneously working on the chip.<ref group=\"note\" >Using [[rubylith]], light boards, rulers, electric erasers, and a [[digitizer]] (according to Jenny Hernandez, member of the 8086 design team, in a statement made on Intel's webpage for its 25th birthday).</ref> The 8086 took a little more than two years from idea to working product, which was considered rather fast for a complex design in 1976\u20131978.\n\nThe 8086 was sequenced<ref group=\"note\" >8086 used less microcode than many competitors' designs, such as the MC68000 and others</ref> using a mixture of [[random logic]]<ref>Randall L. Geiger, Phillip E. Allen, Noel R.

It was soon moved to a new refined nMOS manufacturing process called [[HMOS]] (for High performance MOS) that Intel originally developed for manufacturing of fast [[static RAM]] products.<ref group=\"note\" >Fast static RAMs in MOS technology (as fast as bipolar RAMs) was an important product for Intel during this period.</ref> This was followed by HMOS-II, HMOS-III versions, and, eventually, a fully static [[CMOS]] version for battery powered devices, manufactured using Intel's [[CHMOS]] processes.<ref group=\"note\" >CHMOS is Intel's name for CMOS circuits manufactured using processing steps very similar to [[HMOS]].</ref> The original chip measured 33&nbsp;mm\u00b2 and minimum feature size was 3.2&nbsp;\u03bcm.\n\nThe architecture was defined by [[Stephen P. Morse]] with some help and assistance by Bruce Ravenel (the architect of the 8087) in refining the final revisions. Logic designer Jim McKevitt and John Bayliss were the lead engineers of the hardware-level development team<ref group=\"note\" >Other members of the design team were Peter A.Stoll and Jenny Hernandez.</ref> and Bill Pohlman the manager for the project. The legacy of the 8086 is enduring in the basic instruction set of today's personal computers and servers; the 8086 also lent its last two digits to later extended versions of the design, such as the [[Intel 286]] and the [[Intel 386]], all of which eventually became known as the [[x86]] family. (Another reference is that the [[PCI Configuration Space|PCI Vendor ID]] for Intel devices is 8086<sub>h</sub>.)\n\n==Details==\n[[File:Intel 8086 pinout.svg|thumb|300px|The 8086 pin assignments in min and max mode]]\n\n===Buses and operation===\nAll internal registers, as well as internal and external data buses, are 16&nbsp;bits wide, which firmly established the \"16-bit microprocessor\" identity of the 8086. A 20-bit external address bus provides a 1&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] physical address space (2<sup>20</sup> = 1,048,576). This address space is addressed by means of internal memory \"segmentation\". The data bus is [[multiplexed]] with the address bus in order to fit all of the control lines into a standard 40-pin [[dual in-line package]]. It provides a 16-bit I/O address bus, supporting 64&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] of separate I/O space. The maximum linear address space is limited to 64&nbsp;KB, simply because internal address/index registers are only 16&nbsp;bits wide. Programming over 64&nbsp;KB memory boundaries involves adjusting the segment registers (see below); this difficulty existed until the [[80386]] architecture introduced wider (32-bit) registers (the memory management hardware in the [[80286]] did not help in this regard, as its registers are still only 16 bits wide).\n\n===Hardware modes===\nSome of the control pins, which carry essential signals for all external operations, have more than one function depending upon whether the device is operated in ''min'' or ''max'' mode. The former mode is intended for small single-processor systems, while the latter is for medium or large systems using more than one processor (a kind of multiprocessor mode). Maximum mode is required when using a 8087 or 8089 coprocessor. The voltage on pin 33 (MN/{{overline|MX}}) determine the mode. Changing the state of pin 33 changes the function of certain other pins, most of which have to do with how the CPU handles the (local) bus. <ref group=\"note\" >The IBM PC and PC/XT use an Intel 8088 running in maximum mode, which allows the CPU to work with an optional 8087 coprocessor installed in the math coprocessor socket on the PC or PC/XT mainboard. (The PC and PC/XT may require maximum mode for other reasons, such as perhaps to support the DMA controller.)</ref> The mode is usually hardwired into the circuit and therefore cannot be changed by software. The workings of these modes are described in terms of timing diagrams in Intel datasheets and manuals. In minimum mode, all control signals are generated by the 8086 itself.\n\n===Registers and instructions===\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"font-size:75%;\"\n|-\n|align=\"center\" |''Intel 8086 registers''\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"font-size:88%;\"\n|-\n| style=\"width:10px;

color:black\" | Flags\n|}\n|}\nThe 8086 has eight more or less general 16-bit [[processor register|registers]] (including the [[Stack-based memory allocation|stack pointer]] but excluding the instruction pointer, flag register and segment registers). Four of them, AX, BX, CX, DX, can also be accessed as twice as many 8-bit registers (see figure) while the other four, SI, DI, BP, SP, are 16-bit only.\n\nDue to a compact encoding inspired by 8-bit processors, most instructions are one-address or two-address operations, which means that the result is stored in one of the operands. At most one of the operands can be in memory, but this memory operand can also be the ''destination'', while the other operand, the ''source'', can be either ''register'' or ''immediate''. A single memory location can also often be used as both ''source'' and ''destination'' which, among other factors, further contributes to a [[code density]] comparable to (and often better than) most eight-bit machines at the time.\n\nThe degree of generality of most registers are much greater than in the 8080 or 8085. However, 8086 registers were more specialized than in most contemporary [[minicomputer]]s and are also used implicitly by some instructions. While perfectly sensible for the assembly programmer, this makes register allocation for compilers more complicated compared to more orthogonal 16-bit and 32-bit processors of the time such as the [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[68000]], [[32016]] etc. On the other hand, being more regular than the rather minimalistic but ubiquitous 8-bit microprocessors such as the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], [[Motorola 6800|6800]], [[6809]], [[Intel 8085|8085]], [[MCS-48]], [[Intel 8051|8051]], and other contemporary accumulator based machines, it is significantly easier to construct an efficient [[code generator]] for the 8086 architecture.\n\nAnother factor for this is that the 8086 also introduced some new instructions (not present in the 8080 and 8085) to better support stack-based high-level programming languages such as Pascal and [[PL/M]]; some of the more useful instructions are '''push''' ''mem-op'', and '''ret''' ''size'', supporting the \"Pascal [[calling convention]]\" directly. (Several others, such as '''push'''&nbsp;''immed'' and '''enter''', were added in the subsequent 80186, 80286, and 80386 processors.)\n\nA 64&nbsp;KB (one segment) [[Stack (data structure)|stack]] growing towards lower addresses is supported in [[computer hardware|hardware]]; 16-bit words are pushed onto the stack, and the top of the stack is pointed to by SS:SP. There are 256&nbsp;[[interrupt]]s, which can be invoked by both hardware and software. The interrupts can cascade, using the stack to store the [[return address]]es.\n\nThe 8086 has 64&nbsp;K of 8-bit (or alternatively 32&nbsp;K of 16-bit word) [[I/O port]] space.\n\n===Flags===\n8086 has a 16-bit [[status register|flags register]]. Nine of these condition code flags are active, and indicate the current state of the processor: [[Carry flag]] (CF), [[Parity flag]] (PF), [[Auxiliary flag|Auxiliary carry flag]] (AF), [[Zero flag]] (ZF), [[Sign flag]] (SF), [[Trap flag]] (TF), [[IF (x86 flag)|Interrupt flag]] (IF), [[Direction flag]] (DF), and [[Overflow flag]] (OF).\nAlso referred to as the status word, the layout of the flags register is as follows:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11091251|title=IAPX 86, 88, 186, and 188 user's manual : programmer's reference|others=Intel Corporation.|isbn=978-0835930352|location=Santa Clara, CA|oclc=11091251}}</ref>{{Rp|3-5}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Rather than concatenating the segment register with the address register, as in most processors whose address space exceeds their register size, the 8086 shifts the 16-bit segment only four bits left before adding it to the 16-bit offset (16\u00d7segment + offset), therefore producing a 20-bit external (or effective or physical) address from the 32-bit segment:offset pair. As a result, each external address can be referred to by 2<sup>12</sup> = 4096 different segment:offset pairs.\n\n{| style=\"margin-left:5em\"\n|-\n| <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#DED\">0110 1000 1000 0111</tt><tt>&nbsp;0000</tt>\n| '''Segment''',\n| 16 bits, shifted 4 bits left (or multiplied by 0x10)\n|-\n| <tt>+ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#DDF\">0011 0100 1010 1001</tt>\n| '''Offset''',\n| 16 bits\n|- style=\"text-decoration:line-through\"\n| <tt>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</tt>\n|\n|-\n| <tt>&nbsp; </tt><tt style=\"background:#FDF\">0110 1011 1101 0001 1001</tt>\n| '''Address''',\n| 20 bits\n|}\n\nAlthough considered complicated and cumbersome by many programmers, this scheme also has advantages; a small program (less than 64&nbsp;KB) can be loaded starting at a fixed offset (such as 0000) in its own segment, avoiding the need for [[Relocation (computing)|relocation]], with at most 15&nbsp;bytes of alignment waste.\n\nCompilers for the 8086 family commonly support two types of [[pointer (computer programming)|pointer]], ''near'' and ''far''. Near pointers are 16-bit offsets implicitly associated with the program's code or data segment and so can be used only within parts of a program small enough to fit in one segment. Far pointers are 32-bit segment:offset pairs resolving to 20-bit external addresses. Some compilers also support ''huge'' pointers, which are like far pointers except that [[pointer arithmetic]] on a huge pointer treats it as a linear 20-bit pointer, while pointer arithmetic on a far pointer [[integer overflow|wraps around]] within its 16-bit offset without touching the segment part of the address.\n\nTo avoid the need to specify ''near'' and ''far'' on numerous pointers, data structures, and functions, compilers also support \"memory models\" which specify default pointer sizes. The ''tiny'' (max 64K), ''small'' (max 128K), ''compact'' (data > 64K), ''medium'' (code > 64K), ''large'' (code,data > 64K), and ''huge'' (individual arrays > 64K) models cover practical combinations of near, far, and huge pointers for code and data. The ''tiny'' model means that code and data are shared in a single segment, just as in most 8-bit based processors, and can be used to build ''[[COM file|.com]]'' files for instance. Precompiled libraries often come in several versions compiled for different memory models.\n\nAccording to Morse et al.,.<ref name=\"File\">[http://stevemorse.org/8086history/8086history.doc Intel Microprocessors : 8008 to 8086 by Stephen P. Morse et al.]</ref> the designers actually contemplated using an 8-bit shift (instead of 4-bit), in order to create a 16&nbsp;MB physical address space. However, as this would have forced segments to begin on 256-byte boundaries, and 1&nbsp;MB was considered very large for a microprocessor around 1976, the idea was dismissed. Also, there were not enough pins available on a low cost 40-pin package for the additional four address bus pins\n\nIn principle, the address space of the x86 series ''could'' have been extended in later processors by increasing the shift value, as long as applications obtained their segments from the operating system and did not make assumptions about the equivalence of different segment:offset pairs.<ref group=\"note\" >Some 80186 clones did change the shift value, but were never commonly used in desktop computers.</ref> In practice the use of \"huge\" pointers and similar mechanisms was widespread and the flat 32-bit addressing made possible with the 32-bit offset registers in the 80386 eventually extended the limited addressing range in a more general way (see below).\n\nIntel could have decided to implement memory in 16 bit words (which would have eliminated the {{overline|BHE}} signal along with much of the address bus complexities already described).  This would mean that all instruction object codes and data would have to be accessed in 16-bit units.  Users of the [[8080]] long ago realized, in hindsight, that the processor makes very efficient use of its memory.  By having a large number of 8-bit object codes, the 8080 produces object code as compact as some of the most powerful minicomputers on the market at the time.<ref name=\"Osborne\">Osborne 16 bit Processor Handbook (Adam Osborne & Gerry Kane) {{ISBN|0-931988-43-8}}</ref>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\nIf the 8086 is to retain 8-bit object codes and hence the efficient memory use of the 8080, then it cannot guarantee that (16-bit) opcodes and data will lie on an even-odd byte address boundary.  The first 8-bit opcode will shift the next 8-bit instruction to an odd byte or a 16-bit instruction to an odd-even byte boundary.  By implementing the {{overline|BHE}} signal and the extra logic needed, the 8086 allows instructions to exist as 1-byte, 3-byte or any other odd byte object codes.<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\nSimply put: this is a trade off.  If memory addressing is simplified so that memory is only accessed in 16-bit units, memory will be used less efficiently.  Intel decided to make the logic more complicated, but memory use more efficient.  This was at a time when memory size was considerably smaller, and at a premium, than that which users are used to today.<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5\u201326}}\n\n====Porting older software====\nSmall programs could ignore the segmentation and just use plain 16-bit addressing. This allows [[8-bit]] software to be quite easily ported to the 8086. The authors of MS-DOS took advantage of this by providing an [[Application Programming Interface]] very similar to [[CP/M]] as well as including the simple ''.com'' executable file format, identical to CP/M. This was important when the 8086 and MS-DOS were new, because it allowed many existing CP/M (and other) applications to be quickly made available, greatly easing acceptance of the new platform.\n\n===Example code===\nThe following 8086/8088 [[assembly language|assembler]] source code is for a subroutine named <code>_memcpy</code> that copies a block of data bytes of a given size from one location to another. The data block is copied one byte at a time, and the data movement and looping logic utilizes 16-bit operations.\n\n<!--NOTE: This is not intended to be optimized code, but to illustrate the variety of instructions available on the CPU-->\n<!--NOTE: The hex codes were assembled by hand, so there may be errors-->\n{|\n|\n<!--NOTE: DO NOT REMOVE BLANK LINES--><pre>\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0000:1000\n \n0000:1000\n0000:1000 55\n0000:1001 89 E5\n0000:1003 06\n0000:1004 8B 4E 06\n0000:1007 E3 11\n0000:1009 8B 76 04\n0000:100C 8B 7E 02\n0000:100F 1E\n0000:1010 07\n \n0000:1011 8A 04\n0000:1013 88 05\n0000:1015 46\n0000:1016 47\n0000:1017 49\n0000:1018 75 F7\n \n0000:101A 07\n0000:101B 5D\n0000:101C 29 C0\n0000:101E C3\n0000:101F\n</pre>\n|\n<source lang=\"nasm\">\n; _memcpy(dst, src, len)\n; Copy a block of memory from one location to another.\n;\n; Entry stack parameters\n;      [BP+6] = len, Number of bytes to copy\n;      [BP+4] = src, Address of source data block\n;      [BP+2] = dst, Address of target data block\n;\n; Return registers\n;      AX = Zero\n\n            org     1000h       ; Start at 0000:1000h\n\n_memcpy     proc\n            push    bp          ; Set up the call frame\n            mov     bp,sp\n            push    es          ; Save ES\n            mov     cx,[bp+6]   ; Set CX = len\n            jcxz    done        ; If len = 0, return\n            mov     si,[bp+4]   ; Set SI = src\n            mov     di,[bp+2]   ; Set DI = dst\n            push    ds          ; Set ES = DS\n            pop     es\n\nloop        mov     al,[si]     ; Load AL from [src]\n            mov     [di],al     ; Store AL to [dst]\n            inc     si          ; Increment src\n            inc     di          ; Increment dst\n            dec     cx          ; Decrement len\n            jnz     loop        ; Repeat the loop\n\ndone        pop     es          ; Restore ES\n            pop     bp          ; Restore previous call frame\n            sub     ax,ax       ; Set AX = 0\n            ret                 ; Return\n            end proc\n</source>\n|}\n\nThe code above uses the BP (base pointer) register to establish a [[call frame]], an area on the stack that contains all of the parameters and local variables for the execution of the subroutine. This kind of [[calling convention]] supports [[reentrancy (computing)|reentrant]] and [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] code, and has been used by most ALGOL-like languages since the late 1950s.\n\nThe above routine is a rather cumbersome way to copy blocks of data. The 8086 provides dedicated instructions for copying strings of bytes. These instructions assume that the source data is stored at DS:SI, the destination data is stored at ES:DI, and that the number of elements to copy is stored in CX. The above routine requires the source and the destination block to be in the same segment, therefore DS is copied to ES. The loop section of the above can be replaced by:\n{|\n|\n<pre>\n0000:1011 FC\n0000:1012 F2\n0000:1013 A4\n</pre>\n|\n<source lang=nasm>\n            cld                  ; Copy towards higher addresses\nloop        repnz                ; Repeat until CX = 0\n            movsb                ; Move the data block\n</source>\n|}\nThis copies the block of data one byte at a time.  The <code>REPNZ</code> instruction causes the following <code>MOVSB</code> to repeat until CX is zero, automatically incrementing SI and DI and decrementing CX as it repeats.  Alternatively the <code>MOVSW</code> instruction can be used to copy 16-bit words (double bytes) at a time (in which case CX counts the number of words copied instead of the number of bytes).  Most assemblers will properly recognize the <code>REPNZ</code> instruction if used as an in-line prefix to the <code>MOVSB</code> instruction, as in <code>REPNZ MOVSB</code>.\n\nThis routine will operate correctly if interrupted, because the program counter will continue to point to the <code>REP</code> instruction until the block copy is completed.  The copy will therefore continue from where it left off when the interrupt service routine returns control.\n\n===Performance===\n[[File:Intel 8086 block scheme.svg|thumb|405px|''Simplified block diagram over Intel 8088 (a variant of 8086); 1=main registers; 2=segment registers and IP; 3=address adder; 4=internal address bus; 5=instruction queue; 6=control unit (very simplified!); 7=bus interface; 8=internal databus; 9=ALU; 10/11/12=external address/data/control bus.'']]\n\nAlthough partly shadowed by other design choices in this particular chip, the [[multiplexed]] address and [[Bus (computing)|data buses]] limit performance slightly; transfers of 16-bit or 8-bit quantities are done in a four-clock memory access cycle, which is faster on 16-bit, although slower on 8-bit quantities, compared to many contemporary 8-bit based CPUs. As instructions vary from one to six bytes, fetch and execution are made [[Concurrency (computer science)|concurrent]] and decoupled into separate units (as it remains in today's x86 processors): The ''bus interface unit'' feeds the instruction stream to the ''execution unit'' through a 6-byte prefetch queue (a form of loosely coupled [[pipelining]]), speeding up operations on [[Processor register|register]]s and [[Operand|immediate]]s, while memory operations became slower (four years later, this performance problem was fixed with the [[80186]] and [[80286]]). However, the full (instead of partial) 16-bit architecture with a full width [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]] meant that 16-bit arithmetic instructions could now be performed with a single ALU cycle (instead of two, via internal carry, as in the 8080 and 8085), speeding up such instructions considerably. Combined with [[orthogonalization]]s of operations versus [[operand]] types and [[addressing mode]]s, as well as other enhancements, this made the performance gain over the 8080 or 8085 fairly significant, despite cases where the older chips may be faster (see below).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; width: 100px; height: 50px;\"\n|+ Execution times for typical instructions (in clock cycles)<ref>{{cite book|title=Microsoft Macro Assembler 5.0 Reference Manual|year=1987|publisher=Microsoft Corporation| quote=Timings and encodings in this manual are used with permission of Intel and come from the following publications: Intel Corporation. iAPX 86, 88, 186 and 188 User's Manual, Programmer's Reference, Santa Clara, Calif. 1986.|title-link=MASM}} (Similarly for iAPX 286, 80386, 80387.)</ref>\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:bottom; border-bottom:3px double #999;\"\n!align=left | instruction\n!align=left | register-register\n!align=left | register immediate\n!align=left | register-memory\n!align=left | memory-register\n!align=left | memory-immediate\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|mov || 2 || 4|| 8+EA || 9+EA || 10+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|ALU || 3 ||4|| 9+EA, || 16+EA,|| 17+EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|jump || colspan=\"5\" | ''register'' => 11 ; ''label'' => 15 ; ''condition,label'' => 16\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer multiply || colspan=\"5\" | 70~160 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|-  style=\"vertical-align:top; border-bottom:1px solid #999;\"\n|integer divide || colspan=\"5\" | 80~190 (depending on operand ''data'' as well as size) ''including'' any EA\n|}\n* EA = time to compute effective address, ranging from 5 to 12 cycles.\n* Timings are best case, depending on prefetch status, instruction alignment, and other factors.\n\nAs can be seen from these tables, operations on registers and immediates were fast (between 2 and 4 cycles), while memory-operand instructions and jumps were quite slow; jumps took more cycles than on the simple [[Intel 8080|8080]] and [[Intel 8085|8085]], and the 8088 (used in the IBM PC) was additionally hampered by its narrower bus. The reasons why most memory related instructions were slow were threefold:\n* Loosely coupled fetch and execution units are efficient for instruction prefetch, but not for jumps and random data access (without special measures).\n* No dedicated address calculation adder was afforded; the microcode routines had to use the main ALU for this (although there was a dedicated ''segment'' + ''offset'' adder).\n* The address and data buses were [[multiplexing|multiplex]]ed, forcing a slightly longer (33~50%) bus cycle than in typical contemporary 8-bit processors.\n\nHowever, memory access performance was drastically enhanced with Intel's next generation of 8086 family CPUs. The [[Intel 80186|80186]] and [[Intel 80286|80286]] both had dedicated address calculation hardware, saving many cycles, and the 80286 also had separate (non-multiplexed) address and data buses.\n\n===Floating point===\nThe 8086/8088 could be connected to a mathematical coprocessor to add hardware/microcode-based [[floating-point]] performance. The [[Intel 8087]] was the standard math coprocessor for the 8086 and 8088, operating on 80-bit numbers. Manufacturers like [[Cyrix]] (8087-compatible) and [[Weitek]] (''not'' 8087-compatible) eventually came up with high-performance floating-point coprocessors that competed with the 8087, as well as with the subsequent, higher-performing [[Intel 80387]].\n\n==Chip versions==\nThe clock frequency was originally limited to 5&nbsp;MHz,<ref group=\"note\" >(IBM PC used 4.77&nbsp;MHz, 4/3 the standard NTSC [[color burst]] frequency)</ref> but the last versions in [[HMOS]] were specified for 10&nbsp;MHz. HMOS-III and [[CMOS]] versions were manufactured for a long time (at least a while into the 1990s) for [[embedded system]]s, although its successor, the [[Intel 80186|80186]]/[[Intel 80188|80188]] (which includes some on-chip peripherals), has been more popular for embedded use.\n\nThe 80C86, the CMOS version of the 8086, was used in the [[GRiDPad]], [[Toshiba T1200]], [[HP 110]], and finally the 1998\u20131999 [[Lunar Prospector]].\n\nFor the packaging, the Intel 8086 was available both in ceramic and plastic DIP packages.\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n| [[Image:Intel_D8086_CS.jpg|thumb|A ceramic D8086 variant]]\n| [[Image:Intel_P8086.jpg|thumb|A plastic P8086 variant]]\n|}\n\n===List of Intel 8086===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Such relatively simple and low-power 8086-compatible processors in CMOS are still used in embedded systems.\n\nThe electronics industry of the [[Soviet Union]] was able to replicate the 8086 through {{citation needed-span|both [[industrial espionage]] and reverse engineering|date=October 2013}}.

Introduced on July 1, 1979, the 8088 had an eight-bit external [[Bus (computing)|data bus]] instead of the [[16-bit]] bus of the 8086. The 16-bit registers and the one [[megabyte]] address range were unchanged, however. In fact, according to the Intel documentation, the 8086 and 8088 have the same [[execution unit]] (EU)&mdash;only the [[Bus (computing)|bus interface unit]] (BIU) is different.  The original [[IBM PC]] was based on the 8088.\n\n==History and description==\n[[File:AMD_8088_die.JPG|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of AMD 8088]]\nThe 8088 was designed at Intel's laboratory in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]], as were a large number of Intel's processors.<ref>''The Israel Test'', Encounter Books, 10 Oct 2013, George F. Gilder, page 100.</ref>  The 8088 was targeted at economical systems by allowing the use of an eight-bit data path and eight-bit support and peripheral chips; complex circuit boards were still fairly cumbersome and expensive when it was released. The [[prefetch input queue|prefetch]] queue of the 8088 was shortened to four bytes, from the 8086's six bytes, and the prefetch algorithm was slightly modified to adapt to the narrower bus.{{efn|Specifically, the most obvious change is that the 8088 bus unit will prefetch a byte when it can if at least one byte of the queue is empty; the 8086 bus unit will not prefetch unless at least two of the six queue bytes are empty, so that it can prefetch a whole aligned 16-bit word, which it does in one bus cycle.  The 8088, having an 8-bit external data bus, can only fetch one byte per bus cycle, so waiting to prefetch a whole word would have no benefit and would only delay, reducing the chance that the next instruction byte is already in the prefetch queue when it is needed.}} These modifications of the basic 8086 design were one of the first jobs assigned to Intel's then-new design office and laboratory in Haifa.\n\n[[Image:KL Intel 80C88.jpg|left|thumb|180px|The Intel 80C88]]\nVariants of the 8088 with more than 5&nbsp;MHz maximal clock frequency include the 8088-2, which was [[Semiconductor fabrication|fabricated]] using Intel's new enhanced [[NMOS logic|nMOS]] process called [[HMOS]] and specified for a maximal frequency of 8&nbsp;MHz. Later followed the 80C88, a [[static core|fully static]] [[CHMOS]] design, which could operate with clock speeds from 0 to 8&nbsp;MHz. There were also several other, more or less similar, variants from other manufacturers. For instance, the [[NEC V20]] was a [[pin-compatible]] and slightly faster (at the same clock frequency) variant of the 8088, designed and manufactured by [[NEC]]. Successive NEC 8088 compatible processors would run at up to 16&nbsp;MHz. In 1984, [[Commodore International]] signed a deal to manufacture the 8088 for use in a licensed [[Hyperion (computer)|Dynalogic Hyperion]] clone, in a move that was regarded as signaling a major new direction for the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h9RnfyXzV6sC&pg=PA52|title=Commodore Adds Hyperion, Chips}}</ref>\n\nWhen announced, the list price of the 8088 was US$124.80.<ref name=CW79>{{cite web |title=Intel Brings Out 8-Bit MPU featuring 16-Bit Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouiYCe_Xw20C&pg=PA71&dq=Intel+8088++architecture&hl=en&ei=uSHMTuujM4rIhAfulK3bDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=Intel%208088%20%20architecture&f=false |work=Computerworld |date=14 May 1979 |page=71 |accessdate=21 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Differences from the 8086===\n\nThe 8088 is architecturally very similar to the 8086.  The main difference is that there are only eight data lines instead of the 8086's 16 lines.  All of the other pins of the device perform the same function as they do with the 8086 with two exceptions.  First, pin 34 is no longer {{overline|BHE}} (this is the high-order byte select on the 8086\u2014the 8088 does not have a high-order byte on its eight-bit data bus).<ref name=\"Osborne\">Osborne 16 bit Processor Handbook (Adam Osborne & Gerry Kane) {{ISBN|0-931988-43-8}}.</ref>{{rp|5\u201397}}  Instead it outputs a maximum mode status, {{overline|SSO}}.  Combined with the IO/{{overline|M}} and DT/{{overline|R}} signals, the bus cycles can be decoded (it generally indicates when a write operation or an interrupt is in progress).  The second change is the pin that signals whether a memory access or input/output access is being made has had it sense reversed.  The pin on the 8088 is IO/{{overline|M}}.  On the 8086 part it is {{overline|IO}}/M.  The reason for the reversal is that it makes the 8088 compatible with the [[Intel 8085|8085]].<ref name=\"Osborne\"/>{{rp|5\u201398}}\n\n===Performance===\n[[File:Intel 8088 chip, top.jpg|right|thumb|Top]]\n[[File:Intel 8088 chip, bottom.jpg|right|thumb|bottom]]\nDepending on the [[clock frequency]], the number of memory [[wait state]]s, as well as on the characteristics of the particular application program, the ''average'' performance for the Intel 8088 ranged approximately from 0.33 to 1&nbsp;million [[instructions per second]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympusmicro.com/micd/galleries/chips/intel8088a.html|title=Olympus MIC-D: Integrated Circuit Gallery - Intel 8088 Microprocessor|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519154800/http://www.olympusmicro.com/micd/galleries/chips/intel8088a.html|archive-date=May 19, 2009}}</ref> Meanwhile, the <code>mov ''reg,reg''</code> and <code>[[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]{{efn|ALU stands for one of the instructions ADD, ADC, SUB, SBC, CMP, AND, OR, XOR, TEST.}} ''reg,reg''</code> instructions, taking two and three cycles respectively, yielded an ''absolute peak'' performance of between {{frac|1|3}} and {{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;MIPS per MHz, that is, somewhere in the range 3\u20135&nbsp;MIPS at 10&nbsp;MHz.\n\nThe speed of the execution unit (EU) and the bus of the 8086 CPU was well balanced; with a typical instruction mix, an 8086 could execute instructions out of the prefetch queue a good bit of the time.  Cutting down the bus to eight bits made it a serious bottleneck in the 8088.  With the speed of instruction fetch reduced by 50% in the 8088 as compared to the 8086, a sequence of fast instructions can quickly drain the four-byte prefetch queue.  When the queue is empty, instructions take as long to complete as they take to fetch.  Both the 8086 and 8088 take four clock cycles to complete a bus cycle; whereas for the 8086 this means four clocks to transfer two bytes, on the 8088 it is four clocks per byte.  Therefore, for example, a two-byte shift or rotate instruction, which takes the EU only two clock cycles to execute, actually takes eight clock cycles to complete if it is not in the prefetch queue.  A sequence of such fast instructions prevents the queue from being filled as fast as it is drained, and \nin general, because so many basic instructions execute in fewer than four clocks per instruction byte&mdash;including almost all the ALU and data-movement instructions on register operands and some of these on memory operands&mdash;it is practically impossible to avoid idling the EU in the 8088 at least &frac14; of the time while executing useful real-world programs, and it is not hard to idle it half the time.  In short, an 8088 typically runs about half as fast as 8086 clocked at the same rate, because of the bus bottleneck (the only major difference).\n\nA side effect of the 8088 design, with the slow bus and the small prefetch queue, is that the speed of code execution can be very dependent on instruction order.  When programming the 8088, for CPU efficiency, it is vital to interleave long-running instructions with short ones whenever possible.  For example, a repeated string operation or a shift by three or more will take long enough to allow time for the 4-byte prefetch queue to completely fill.  If short instructions (i.e. ones totaling few bytes) are placed between slower instructions like these, the short ones can execute at full speed out of the queue.  If, on the other hand, the slow instructions are executed sequentially, back to back, then after the first of them the bus unit will be forced to idle because the queue will already be full, with the consequence that later more of the faster instructions will suffer fetch delays that might have been avoidable.  As some instructions, such as single-bit-position shifts and rotates, take literally 4 times as long to fetch as to execute,{{efn|On the 8088, a shift instruction with an implied shift count of 1, which can execute in two clock cycles, is two bytes long and so takes eight clock cycles to fetch.}} the overall effect can be a slowdown by a factor of two or more.  If those code segments are the bodies of loops, the difference in execution time may be very noticeable on the human timescale.\n\nThe 8088 is also (like the 8086) slow at accessing memory.  The same ALU that is used to execute arithmetic and logic instructions is also used to calculate effective addresses.  There is a separate adder for adding a shifted segment register to the offset address, but the offset EA itself is always calculated entirely in the main ALU.  Furthermore, the loose coupling of the EU and BIU (bus unit) inserts communication overhead between the units, and the four-clock period bus transfer cycle is not particularly streamlined.  Contrast this with the two-clock period bus cycle of the 6502 CPU and the 80286's three-clock period bus cycle with pipelining down to two cycles for most transfers.  Most 8088 instructions that can operate on either registers or memory, including common ALU and data-movement operations, are at least four times slower for memory operands than for only register operands.  Therefore, efficient 8088 (and 8086) programs avoid repeated access of memory operands when possible, loading operands from memory into registers to work with them there and storing back only the finished results.  The relatively large general register set of the 8088 compared to its contemporaries assists this strategy.  When there are not enough registers for all variables that are needed at once, saving registers by pushing them onto the stack and popping them back to restore them is the fastest way to use memory to augment the registers, as the stack PUSH and POP instructions are the fastest memory operations.  The same is probably not true on the 80286 and later; they have dedicated address ALUs and perform memory accesses much faster than the 8088 and 8086.\n\nFinally, because calls, jumps, and interrupts reset the prefetch queue, and because loading the IP register requires communication between the EU and the BIU (since the IP register is in the BIU, not in the EU, where the general registers are), these operations are costly.  All jumps and calls take at least 15 clock cycles.  Any conditional jump requires four clock cycles if not taken, but if taken, it requires 16 cycles in addition to resetting the prefetch queue; therefore, conditional jumps should be arranged to be not taken most of the time, especially inside loops.  In some cases, a sequence of logic and movement operations is faster than a conditional jump that skips over one or two instructions to achieve the same result.\n\nIntel datasheets for the 8086 and 8088 advertised the dedicated multiply and divide instructions (MUL, IMUL, DIV, and IDIV), but they are very slow, on the order of 100\u2013200 clock cycles each.  Many simple multiplications by small constants (besides powers of 2, for which shifts can be used) can be done much faster using dedicated short subroutines.  The 80286 and 80386 each greatly increased the execution speed of these multiply and divide instructions.  {{efn|Most of the technical information in this section is sourced from the Intel iAPX 86,88 User's Manual, August 1981 (Order Number: 210201-001) by Intel Corporation.}}\n\n===Selection for use in the IBM PC===\nThe original [[IBM PC]] was the most influential microcomputer to use the 8088. It used a [[clock frequency]] of 4.77&nbsp;MHz (4/3 the [[NTSC]] [[colorburst]] frequency). Some of IBM's engineers and other employees wanted to use the [[IBM 801]] processor, some would have preferred the new [[Motorola 68000]],{{efn|Later used for the IBM Instruments [[IBM System 9000|Laboratory Computer]].}} while others argued for a small and simple microprocessor, such as the [[MOS Technology 6502]] or [[Zilog Z80]], which had been used in earlier personal computers. However, IBM already had a history of using Intel chips in its products and had also acquired the rights to manufacture the [[Intel 8086|8086]] family.{{efn|In exchange for giving Intel the rights to its [[bubble memory]] designs. However, due to fierce competition from Japanese manufacturers, who were able to undercut by cost, Intel soon left this market and changed focus to microprocessors.}}\n\nIBM chose the 8088 over the 8086 because Intel offered a better price for the former and could supply more units.<ref name=\"freiberger19820823\">{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VDAEAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA19&pg=PA22#v=onepage&q&f=true | title=Bill Gates, Microsoft and the IBM Personal Computer | work=InfoWorld | date=1982-08-23 | accessdate=29 January 2015 | author=Freiberger, Paul | pages=22}}</ref> Another factor was that the 8088 allowed the computer to be based on a modified [[Intel 8085|8085]] design, as it could easily interface with most nMOS chips with 8-bit databuses, i.e. existing and mature, and therefore economical, components.

This contrasts with other materials, [[semiconductor]]s and [[electrical conductor|conductors]], which conduct electric current more easily. The property that distinguishes an insulator is its [[resistivity]]; insulators have higher resistivity than semiconductors or conductors.\n\nA perfect insulator does not exist, because even insulators contain small numbers of mobile charges ([[charge carrier]]s) which can carry current.  In addition, all insulators become [[electrically conductive]] when a sufficiently large voltage is applied that the electric field tears [[electron]]s away from the atoms.   This is known as the [[breakdown voltage]] of an insulator.    Some materials such as [[glass]], [[Electrical insulation paper|paper]] and [[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], which have high [[resistivity]], are very good electrical insulators.  A much larger class of materials, even though they may have lower bulk resistivity, are still good enough to prevent significant current from flowing at normally used voltages,  and thus are employed as insulation for [[Wiring|electrical wiring]] and [[Electrical cable|cables]].  Examples include rubber-like [[polymer]]s and most [[plastic]]s which can be [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] or [[thermoplastic]] in nature.\n\nInsulators are used in electrical equipment to support and separate electrical [[Electrical conductor|conductors]] without allowing current through themselves.  An insulating material used in bulk to wrap electrical cables or other equipment is called ''insulation''. The term ''insulator'' is also used more specifically to refer to insulating supports used to attach [[electric power distribution]] or [[Electric power transmission|transmission]] lines to [[utility pole]]s and [[transmission tower]]s.  They support the weight of the suspended wires without allowing the current to flow through the tower to ground.\n\n==Physics of conduction in solids==\nElectrical insulation is the absence of [[electrical conduction]]. Electronic [[Electronic band structure|band theory]] (a branch of physics) says that a charge flows if states are available into which electrons can be excited. This allows electrons to gain energy and thereby move through a conductor such as a [[metal]]. If no such states are available, the material is an insulator.\n\nMost (though not all, see [[Mott insulator]]) insulators have a large [[band gap]]. This occurs because the \"valence\" band containing the highest energy electrons is full, and a large energy gap separates this band from the next band above it. There is always some voltage (called the [[breakdown voltage]]) that gives electrons enough energy to be excited into this band. Once this voltage is exceeded the material ceases being an insulator, and charge begins to pass through it. However, it is usually accompanied by physical or chemical changes that permanently degrade the material's insulating properties.\n\nMaterials that lack electron conduction are insulators if they lack other mobile charges as well. For example, if a liquid or gas contains ions, then the ions can be made to flow as an electric current, and the material is a conductor. [[Electrolyte]]s and [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]] contain ions and act as conductors whether or not electron flow is involved.\n\n===Breakdown===\nWhen subjected to a high enough voltage, insulators suffer from the phenomenon of [[electrical breakdown]]. When the electric field applied across an insulating substance exceeds in any location the threshold breakdown field for that substance,  the insulator suddenly becomes a conductor, causing a large increase in current, an [[electric arc]] through the substance.  Electrical breakdown occurs when the [[electric field]] in the material is strong enough to accelerate free [[charge carrier]]s (electrons and ions, which are always present at low concentrations) to a high enough velocity to knock electrons from atoms when they strike them, [[ion]]izing the atoms. These freed electrons and ions are in turn accelerated and strike other atoms, creating more charge carriers, in a [[chain reaction]]. Rapidly the insulator becomes filled with mobile charge carriers, and its [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistance]] drops to a low level.  In a solid, the breakdown voltage is proportional to the [[band gap]] energy. When [[corona discharge]] occurs, the air in a region around a high-voltage conductor can break down and ionise without a catastrophic increase in current. However, if the region of air breakdown extends to another conductor at a different voltage it creates a conductive path between them, and a large current flows through the air, creating an ''[[electric arc]]''. Even a vacuum can suffer a sort of breakdown, but in this case the breakdown or [[vacuum arc]] involves charges ejected from the surface of metal electrodes rather than produced by the vacuum itself.\n\nIn addition, all insulators become conductors at very high temperatures as the thermal energy of the valence electrons is sufficient to put them in the conduction band.<ref name=\"Kakani2005\">{{cite book|author=S.

Wires sometimes don't use an insulating coating, just air, since a solid (e.g. plastic) coating may be impractical.  However, wires that touch each other produce cross connections, [[short circuit]]s, and fire hazards. In [[coaxial cable]] the center conductor must be supported exactly in the middle of the hollow shield to prevent EM wave reflections. Finally, wires that expose voltages higher than 60 V{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} can cause human shock and [[electric shock|electrocution]] hazards. Insulating coatings help to prevent all of these problems.\n\nSome wires have a mechanical covering with no voltage rating{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\u2014e.g.: service-drop, welding, doorbell, thermostat wire. An insulated wire or cable has a voltage rating and a maximum conductor temperature rating. It may not have an [[ampacity]] (current-carrying capacity) rating, since this is dependent upon the surrounding environment (e.g. ambient temperature).\n\nIn electronic systems, [[printed circuit board]]s are made from epoxy plastic and fibreglass. The nonconductive boards support layers of copper foil conductors. In electronic devices, the tiny and delicate active components are embedded within nonconductive [[epoxy]] or [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]] plastics, or within baked glass or ceramic coatings.\n\nIn [[semiconductor device|microelectronic components]] such as [[transistor]]s and [[integrated circuit|ICs]], the silicon material is normally a conductor because of doping, but it can easily be selectively transformed into a good insulator by the application of heat and oxygen. Oxidised silicon is [[quartz]], i.e. [[silicon dioxide]], the primary component of glass.\n\nIn [[high voltage]] systems containing [[transformer]]s and [[capacitors]], liquid insulator oil is the typical method used for preventing arcs. The oil replaces air in spaces that must support significant voltage without [[electrical breakdown]]. Other high voltage system insulation materials include ceramic or glass wire holders, gas, vacuum, and simply placing wires far enough apart to use air as insulation.\n\n==Telegraph and power transmission insulators==\n[[File:Power line with ceramic insulators.jpg|thumb|Power lines with ceramic insulators in [[California]], USA]]\n\nOverhead conductors for high-voltage [[electric power transmission]] are bare, and are insulated by the surrounding air. Conductors for lower voltages in [[Electric power distribution|distribution]] may have some insulation but are often bare as well. Insulating supports called ''insulators'' are required at the points where they are supported by [[utility pole]]s or [[transmission tower]]s. Insulators are also required where the wire enters buildings or electrical devices, such as [[transformer]]s or [[circuit breaker]]s, to insulate the wire from the case. These hollow insulators with a conductor inside them are called [[bushing (electrical)|bushing]]s.\n\n[[File:Ceramic electric insulator.jpg|thumb|upright|left|10 kV ceramic insulator, showing sheds]]\n\n===Material===\nInsulators used for high-voltage power transmission are made from [[glass]], [[porcelain]] or [[composite material|composite polymer materials]]. Porcelain insulators are made from [[clay]], [[quartz]] or [[alumina]] and [[feldspar]], and are covered with a smooth glaze to shed water. Insulators made from porcelain rich in alumina are used where high mechanical strength is a criterion.

Walker's Insulator Information] page</ref>    Some insulator manufacturers stopped making glass insulators in the late 1960s, switching to ceramic materials.\n\nRecently, some electric utilities have begun converting to polymer [[Composite material|composite]] materials for some types of insulators. These are typically composed of a central rod made of [[fibre reinforced plastic]] and an outer weathershed made of [[Silicone|silicone rubber]] or ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber ([[EPDM rubber|EPDM]]). Composite insulators are less costly, lighter in weight, and have excellent [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] capability. This combination makes them ideal for service in polluted areas. However, these materials do not yet have the long-term proven service life of glass and porcelain.\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Fotothek df n-15 0000283 Facharbeiter f\u00fcr Sintererzeugnisse.jpg|thumb|250px|High voltage ceramic bushing during manufacture, before [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]]. ]]\n\nThe electrical [[Breakdown voltage|breakdown]] of an insulator due to excessive voltage can occur in one of two ways:\n* A ''puncture arc'' is a breakdown and conduction of the material of the insulator, causing an [[electric arc]] through the interior of the insulator. The heat resulting from the arc usually damages the insulator irreparably.  ''Puncture voltage'' is the voltage across the insulator (when installed in its normal manner) that causes a puncture arc.\n* A ''flashover arc'' is a breakdown and conduction of the air around or along the surface of the insulator, causing an arc along the outside of the insulator. Insulators are usually designed to withstand [[flashover]] without damage.  ''Flashover voltage'' is the voltage that causes a flash-over arc. \nMost high voltage insulators are designed with a lower flashover voltage than puncture voltage, so they flash over before they puncture, to avoid damage.\n\nDirt, pollution, salt, and particularly water on the surface of a high voltage insulator can create a conductive path across it, causing leakage currents and flashovers. The flashover voltage can be reduced by more than 50% when the insulator is wet. High voltage insulators for outdoor use are shaped to maximise the length of the leakage path along the surface from one end to the other, called the creepage length, to minimise these leakage currents.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = Holtzhausen\n  | first = J.P.\n  | authorlink =\n  | title = High Voltage Insulators\n  | work =\n  | publisher = IDC Technologies\n  | url = http://www.idc-online.com/technical_references/pdfs/electrical_engineering/highvoltage.pdf\n  | format =\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate = 2008-10-17}}</ref> To accomplish this the surface is moulded into a series of corrugations or concentric disc shapes. These usually include one or more ''sheds''; downward facing cup-shaped surfaces that act as umbrellas to ensure that the part of the surface leakage path under the 'cup' stays dry in wet weather. Minimum creepage distances are 20\u201325&nbsp;mm/kV, but must be increased in high pollution or airborne sea-salt areas.\n\n[[File:pylon.detail.arp.750pix.jpg|thumb|250px|Suspension insulator string (the vertical string of discs) on a 275 kV suspension pylon.]]\n[[File:LIC U70.jpg|thumb|Suspended glass disc insulator unit used in suspension insulator strings for high voltage transmission lines]]\n\n===Types of insulators===\nThese are the common classes of insulator:{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n*''[[Pin insulator|Pin type insulator]]'' - As the name suggests, the pin type insulator is mounted on a pin on the cross-arm on the pole. There is a groove on the upper end of the insulator. The conductor passes through this groove and is tied to the insulator with annealed wire of the same material as the conductor. Pin type insulators are used for transmission and distribution of communications, and electric power at voltages up to 33 kV. Insulators made for operating voltages between 33kV and 69kV tend to be very bulky and have become uneconomical in recent years.\n*''Post insulator'' - A type of insulator in the 1930s that is more compact than traditional pin-type insulators and which has rapidly replaced many pin-type insulators on lines up to 69kV and in some configurations, can be made for operation at up to 115kV.\n*''Suspension insulator'' - For voltages greater than 33 kV, it is a usual practice to use suspension type insulators, consisting of a number of glass or porcelain discs connected in series by metal links in the form of a string. The conductor is suspended at the bottom end of this string while the top end is secured to the cross-arm of the tower. The number of disc units used depends on the voltage.\n*''[[Strain insulator]]'' - A ''dead end'' or ''anchor'' pole or tower is used where a straight section of line ends, or angles off in another direction.  These poles must withstand the lateral (horizontal) tension of the long straight section of wire. To support this lateral load, strain insulators are used. For low voltage lines (less than 11 kV), shackle insulators are used as strain insulators. However, for high voltage transmission lines, strings of cap-and-pin (suspension) insulators are used, attached to the crossarm in a horizontal direction. When the tension load in lines is exceedingly high, such as at long river spans, two or more strings are used in parallel.\n*''Shackle insulator'' - In early days, the shackle insulators were used as strain insulators. But nowaday, they are frequently used for low voltage distribution lines. Such insulators can be used either in a horizontal position or in a vertical position. They can be directly fixed to the pole with a bolt or to the cross arm.\n*''[[Bushing (electrical)|Bushing]]'' - enables one or several conductors to pass through a partition such as a wall or a tank, and insulates the conductors from it.<ref>IEC 60137:2003. 'Insulated bushings for alternating voltages\nabove 1,000 V.' IEC, 2003.</ref>\n*''Line post insulator''\n*''Station post insulator''\n*''Cut-out''\n\n===Suspension insulators ===\n\nPin-type insulators are unsuitable for voltages greater than about 69 kV line-to-line. Higher transmission voltages use suspension insulator strings, which can be made for any practical transmission voltage by adding insulator elements to the string.<ref name=STDHBK>Donald G. Fink, H. Wayne Beaty (ed).,''Standard Handbook for Electrical Engineers, 11th Edition'',McGraw-Hill, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-020974-X}}, pages 14-153, 14-154</ref>\n\nHigher voltage [[transmission line]]s usually use modular suspension insulator designs. The wires are suspended from a 'string' of identical disc-shaped insulators that attach to each other with metal [[clevis pin]] or ball and socket links. The advantage of this design is that insulator strings with different [[breakdown voltage]]s, for use with different line voltages, can be constructed by using different numbers of the basic units. Also, if one of the insulator units in the string breaks, it can be replaced without discarding the entire string.\n\nEach unit is constructed of a ceramic or glass disc with a metal cap and pin cemented to opposite sides. To make defective units obvious, glass units are designed so that an overvoltage causes a puncture arc through the glass instead of a flashover. The glass is heat-treated so it shatters, making the damaged unit visible. However the mechanical strength of the unit is unchanged, so the insulator string stays together.\n\nStandard suspension disc insulator units are {{convert|25|cm|in}} in diameter and {{convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, can support a load of 80-120 k[[Newton (unit)|N]] (18-27 k[[Pound (force)|lbf]]), have a dry flashover voltage of about 72 kV, and are rated at an operating voltage of 10-12 kV.<ref name=\"Grigsby\">{{cite book| last = Grigsby| first = Leonard L.| title = The Electric Power Engineering Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/?id=wiv1tuMDbTEC&pg=PA1346| year = 2001| publisher = [[CRC Press]]| location = USA| isbn = 0-8493-8578-4 }}</ref> However, the flashover voltage of a string is less than the sum of its component discs, because the electric field is not distributed evenly across the string but is strongest at the disc nearest to the conductor, which flashes over first. Metal ''[[grading ring]]s'' are sometimes added around the disc at the high voltage end, to reduce the electric field across that disc and improve flashover voltage.\n\nIn very high voltage lines the insulator may be surrounded by [[corona ring]]s.<ref>{{cite book| last = Bakshi| first = M| title = Electrical Power Transmission and Distribution| url = https://books.google.com/?id=REww2ZF2RwwC| year = 2007| publisher = Technical Publications| isbn = 978-81-8431-271-3 }}</ref>   These typically consist of [[torus]]es of aluminium (most commonly) or copper tubing attached to the line.

[[Quidenham]], [[Norfolk]], [[United Kingdom]].]]\n\n===History===\nThe first electrical systems to make use of insulators were [[telegraph]] lines; direct attachment of wires to wooden poles was found to give very poor results, especially during damp weather.\n\nThe first glass insulators used in large quantities had an unthreaded pinhole. These pieces of glass were positioned on a tapered wooden pin, vertically extending upwards from the pole's crossarm (commonly only two insulators to a pole and maybe one on top of the pole itself). Natural contraction and expansion of the wires tied to these \"threadless insulators\" resulted in insulators unseating from their pins, requiring manual reseating.\n\nAmongst the first to produce ceramic insulators were companies in the United Kingdom, with Stiff and [[Royal Doulton|Doulton]] using [[stoneware]] from the mid-1840s, Joseph Bourne (later renamed [[Denby Pottery Company|Denby]]) producing them from around 1860 and Bullers from 1868. [[patent|Utility patent]] number [http://reference.insulators.info/patents/detail/?patent=48906&type=U 48,906] was granted to Louis A. Cauvet on 25 July 1865 for a process to produce insulators with a threaded pinhole: pin-type insulators still have threaded pinholes.\n\nThe invention of suspension-type insulators made high-voltage power transmission possible. As transmission line voltages reached and passed 60,000 volts, the insulators required become very large and heavy, with insulators made for a safety margin of 88,000 volts being about the practical limit for manufacturing and installation. Suspension insulators, on the other hand, can be connected into strings as long as required for the line's voltage.\n\nA large variety of telephone, telegraph and power insulators have been made; some people collect them, both for their historic interest and for the aesthetic quality of many insulator designs and finishes. One collectors organisation is the US National Insulator Association, which has over 9,000 members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nia.org/|title=Insulators : National Insulator Association Home Page|website=www.nia.org|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==Insulation of antennas==\n[[File:Tamagaishi.jpg|thumb|250px|Egg shaped strain insulator]]\nOften a [[broadcasting]] [[radio antenna]] is built as a [[mast radiator]], which means that the entire mast structure is energised with high voltage and must be insulated from the ground. [[Steatite]] mountings are used. They have to withstand not only the voltage of the mast radiator to ground, which can reach values up to 400 kV at some antennas, but also the weight of the mast construction and dynamic forces. [[Arcing horns]] and [[lightning arrester]]s are necessary because lightning strikes to the mast are common.\n\n[[Guy wire]]s supporting antenna masts usually have [[strain insulator]]s inserted in the cable run, to keep the high voltages on the antenna from short circuiting to ground or creating a shock hazard. Often guy cables have several insulators, placed to break up the cable into lengths unwanted electrical [[resonance]]s in the guy. These insulators are usually ceramic and cylindrical or egg-shaped (see picture). This construction has the advantage that the ceramic is under compression rather than tension, so it can withstand greater load, and that if the insulator breaks, the cable ends are still linked.\n\nThese insulators also have to be equipped with overvoltage protection equipment. For the dimensions of the guy insulation, static charges on guys have to be considered. At high masts these can be much higher than the voltage caused by the transmitter, requiring guys divided by insulators in multiple sections on the highest masts. In this case, guys which are grounded at the anchor basements via a coil - or if possible, directly - are the better choice.\n\n[[Feedline]]s attaching antennas to radio equipment, particularly [[twin lead]] type, often must be kept at a distance from metal structures. The insulated supports used for this purpose are called ''standoff insulators''.\n\n==Insulation in electrical apparatus==\nThe most important insulation material is air. A variety of solid, liquid, and [[dielectric gas|gaseous]] insulators are also used in electrical apparatus. In smaller [[transformer]]s, [[electrical generator|generators]], and [[electric motor]]s, insulation on the wire coils consists of up to four thin layers of polymer varnish film. Film insulated '''magnet wire''' permits a manufacturer to obtain the maximum number of turns within the available space. Windings that use thicker conductors are often wrapped with supplemental fiberglass [[insulating tape]]. Windings may also be impregnated with insulating varnishes to prevent [[corona discharge|electrical corona]] and reduce magnetically induced wire vibration. Large power transformer windings are still mostly insulated with [[Electrical insulation paper|paper]], wood, varnish, and [[mineral oil]]; although these materials have been used for more than 100 years, they still provide a good balance of economy and adequate performance. [[Busbar]]s and [[circuit breaker]]s in [[switchgear]] may be insulated with glass-reinforced plastic insulation, treated to have low flame spread and to prevent tracking of current across the material.\n\nIn older apparatus made up to the early 1970s, boards made of compressed [[asbestos]] may be found; while this is an adequate insulator at power frequencies, handling or repairs to asbestos material can release dangerous fibers into the air and must be carried cautiously. Wire insulated with felted asbestos was used in high-temperature and rugged applications from the 1920s. Wire of this type was sold by [[General Electric]] under the trade name \"Deltabeston.\"<ref>{{cite book| author = Bernhard, Frank|author2=Frank H.

Some high voltage equipment is designed to operate within a high pressure [[insulating gas]] such as [[sulfur hexafluoride]]. Insulation materials that perform well at power and low frequencies may be unsatisfactory at [[radio frequency]], due to heating from excessive dielectric dissipation.\n\nElectrical wires may be insulated with [[polyethylene]], crosslinked polyethylene (either through [[electron beam processing]] or chemical crosslinking), [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[Kapton]], rubber-like polymers, oil impregnated paper, [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]], silicone, or modified ethylene tetrafluoroethylene ([[ETFE]]). Larger [[power cable]]s may use [[mineral-insulated copper-clad cable|compressed inorganic powder]], depending on the application.\n\nFlexible insulating materials such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC (polyvinyl chloride)]] are used to insulate the circuit and prevent human contact with a 'live' wire \u2013 one having voltage of 600 volts or less. Alternative materials are likely to become increasingly used due to EU safety and environmental legislation making PVC less economic.\n\n===Class 1 and Class 2 insulation===\n{{Main|Appliance classes}}\nAll portable or hand-held electrical devices are insulated to protect their user from harmful shock.\n\nClass 1 insulation requires that the metal body and other exposed metal parts of the device be connected to earth via a ''grounding wire'' that is [[earth (electricity)|earth]]ed at the main service panel\u2014but only needs basic insulation on the conductors. This equipment needs an extra pin on the [[power plug]] for the grounding connection.\n\nClass 2 insulation means that the device is ''double insulated''. This is used on some appliances such as electric shavers, hair dryers and portable power tools. Double insulation requires that the devices have both basic and supplementary insulation, each of which is sufficient to prevent [[electric shock]]. All internal electrically energized components are totally enclosed within an insulated body that prevents any contact with \"live\" parts. In the [[European Union|EU]], double insulated appliances all are marked with a symbol of two squares, one inside the other.<ref>{{cite news|title= Understanding IEC Appliance Insulation Classes: I, II and III |url= http://www.fiduspower.com/news/understanding-iec-appliance-insulation-classes-i-ii-and-iii|work=Fidus Power |date=6 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Dielectric material]]\n* [[Electrical conductivity]]\n* [[Electrical substation]]\n* [[Michael Faraday]]\n* [[Henry Clay Fry]]\n* [[Grounding kit]]\n* [[Kondo insulator]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book| author = Sue Taylor| title = Bullers of Milton| date = May 2003| isbn = 978-1-897949-96-2 }}\n*[http://lhotser.com/upfile/201503/Influence_of_Installation_Position_of_500kV_Grading_Ring_for_Composite_Insulator_towards_Ice_Flashover_Process.pdf  Function of Grading rings to Composite Insulator]\n\n{{Commons category|Electric insulators}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Insulator (Electrical)}}\n[[Category:Materials]]\n[[Category:Electrical resistance and conductance]]\n\n[[fr:Isolant \u00e9lectrique]]", "sha1": "0ozwkwj88k1wxxcjv17o1ac0afnfjvn"}}, {"title": "Internetworking", "ns": "0", "id": "15067", "revision": {"id": "858272208", "parentid": "858271855", "timestamp": "2018-09-06T01:28:48Z", "contributor": {"username": "Hrodvarsson", "id": "31083192"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contribs/2409:4062:200B:440D:212C:C75A:CFF7:DD4F|2409:4062:200B:440D:212C:C75A:CFF7:DD4F]] ([[User talk:2409:4062:200B:440D:212C:C75A:CFF7:DD4F|talk]]) to last version by JensLechtenboerger", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{unreferenced|date=February 2017}}\n{{refimprove|date=October 2016}}\n'''Internetworking''' is \"the concept of interconnecting different types of [[computer network|network]]s to build a large, global network\"<ref name=PD2012>{{cite book |last1=Peterson |first1=Larry L. |last2=Davie |first2=Bruce S.|date=2012 |title=Computer Networks: a systems approach |publisher=Elsevier, Inc. |isbn=978-0-12-385059-1}}</ref>{{rp|169}} such that any pair of connected [[Host_(network)|host]]s can exchange [[Packet (information technology)|packet]]s.

Internetworking is a combination of the words ''inter'' (\"between\") and networking; not ''internet-working'' or ''international-network''.\n\nThe most notable example of internetworking is the [[Internet]], a network of networks based on many underlying hardware technologies. For the Internet, the [[Internet Protocol]] defines a unified, global address format and provides rules for format and handling of packets, and [[Router (computing)|router]]s are the components that interconnect participating networks.{{r|CDKB2012|p=103}}\n\nThe smallest amount of effort to create an internet (an internetwork, not ''the'' Internet), is to have two [[Local Area Network|LAN]]s of computers connected to each other via a router. Simply using either a [[switch (network)|switch]] or a hub to connect two local area networks together doesn't imply internetworking; it just expands the original LAN.\n\n==Interconnection of networks==\nInternetworking started as a way to connect disparate types of networking technology, but it became widespread through the developing need to connect two or more [[local area network]]s via some sort of [[wide area network]]. The original term for an internetwork was [[catenet]].\n\nThe definition of an internetwork today includes the connection of other types of computer networks such as [[personal area network]]s.\nThe network elements used to connect individual networks in the [[ARPANET]], the predecessor of the Internet, were originally called [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]], but the term has been deprecated in this context, because of possible confusion with functionally different devices. Today the interconnecting gateways are called [[Router (computing)|router]]s.\n\nAnother type of interconnection of networks often occurs within enterprises at the [[Link Layer]] of the networking model, i.e. at the hardware-centric layer below the level of the TCP/IP logical interfaces. Such interconnection is accomplished with [[network bridge]]s and [[network switch]]es. This is sometimes incorrectly termed internetworking, but the resulting system is simply a larger, single [[subnetwork]], and no internetworking [[Communications protocol|protocol]], such as [[Internet Protocol]], is required to traverse these devices. However, a single computer network may be converted into an internetwork by dividing the network into segments and logically dividing the segment traffic with routers.\nThe Internet Protocol is designed to provide an unreliable (not guaranteed) [[Packet (information technology)|packet]] service across the network. The architecture avoids intermediate network elements maintaining any state of the network. Instead, this function is assigned to the endpoints of each communication session. To transfer data reliably, applications must utilize an appropriate [[Transport Layer]] protocol, such as [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP), which provides a [[reliable stream]]. Some applications use a simpler, connection-less transport protocol, [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP), for tasks which do not require reliable delivery of data or that require real-time service, such as [[video streaming]] <ref name=\"Teare\">\n{{cite book\n |last=Teare \n |first=Diane \n |authorlink= \n |coauthors= \n |title='Designing Cisco Networks' \n |publisher=Cisco Press \n |date=July 1999 \n |location=Indianapolis \n |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk1330/tsd_technology_support_technical_reference_chapter09186a0080759781.html \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207144013/http://cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk1330/tsd_technology_support_technical_reference_chapter09186a0080759781.html \n |dead-url=yes \n |archive-date=2007-02-07 \n |doi= \n |id= \n |df= \n}}</ref> or voice chat.\n\n==Networking models==\nTwo architectural models are commonly used to describe the protocols and methods used in internetworking.\n\nThe [[Open System Interconnection]] (OSI) reference model was developed under the auspices of the [[International Organization for Standardization ]] (ISO) and provides a rigorous description for layering protocol functions from the underlying hardware to the software interface concepts in user applications. Internetworking is implemented in the [[Network Layer]] (Layer 3) of the model.\n\nThe [[Internet Protocol Suite]], also called the [[TCP/IP]] model of the Internet was not designed to conform to the OSI model and does not refer to it in any of the normative specifications in [[Requests for Comment]] and [[Internet standard]]s. Despite similar appearance as a layered model, it uses a much less rigorous, loosely defined architecture that concerns itself only with the aspects of logical networking. It does not discuss hardware-specific low-level interfaces, and assumes availability of a [[Link Layer]] interface to the local network link to which the host is connected. Internetworking is facilitated by the protocols of its [[Internet Layer]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of the Internet]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Network architecture]]", "sha1": "cph1zpfv8d72tt9ld8ru3dthr4ezwuv"}}, {"title": "Infantry", "ns": "0", "id": "15068", "revision": {"id": "862512886", "parentid": "862512087", "timestamp": "2018-10-04T21:28:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Dl2000", "id": "917223"}, "comment": "reflist auto", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect| Foot soldier|other uses of \"foot soldier\"|Foot soldier (disambiguation)|the computer game|Infantry (computer game)}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Marine-assault-okinawa-1945.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Infantrymen of the US [[6th Marine Division]] search the ruins of [[Naha]], [[Battle of Okinawa|Okinawa]] for Japanese snipers, Spring 1945]]\n[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Infantry of the [[Royal Ulster Rifles|Royal Irish Rifles]] at the [[Battle of the Somme]] (July\u2013November 1916) during the [[First World War]]]]\n\n'''Infantry''' is the branch of an [[army]] that engages in [[military combat]] on foot, distinguished from [[cavalry]], [[artillery]], and [[tank]] forces. Also known as '''foot soldiers''', infantry traditionally relies on moving by foot between combats as well, but may also use [[Riding animal|mounts]], [[military vehicle]]s, or other transport. Infantry make up a large portion of all [[armed forces]] in most nations, and typically bear the largest brunt in [[warfare]], as measured by [[Casualty (person)#Military usage|casualties]], deprivation, or [[Stress (biology)|physical]] and [[psychological stress]].\n\n{{History of war}}\n\nThe first military forces in history were infantry. In [[Ancient history|antiquity]], infantry were armed with an early [[melee weapon]] such as a [[spear]], [[Battle axe|axe]] or [[sword]], or an early [[ranged weapon]] like a [[javelin]], [[Sling (weapon)|sling]], or [[Bow and arrow|bow]], with a few infantrymen having both a melee and a ranged weapon. With the [[History of gunpowder|development of gunpowder]], infantry began converting to primarily [[firearm]]s. By the time of [[Napoleonic warfare]], infantry, cavalry, and artillery formed a basic triad of ground forces, though infantry usually remained the most numerous. With [[armoured warfare]], [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s have replaced the horses of cavalry, and [[airpower]] has added a new dimension to ground combat, but infantry remains pivotal to all modern [[combined arms]] operations.\n\nInfantry have much greater local [[situational awareness]] than other military forces, due to their inherent intimate contact with the battlefield (\"boots on the ground\"); this is vital for taking or holding ground (any [[Tactical objective|military objectives]]), securing battlefield victories, maintaining military area control and security both at and behind the [[front line]]s, for capturing ordnance or materiel, taking prisoners, and [[military occupation]]. Infantry can more easily recognise, adapt and respond to local conditions, weather, and changing enemy weapons or tactics. They can operate in a wide range of terrain inaccessible to [[military vehicle]]s, and can operate with a lower [[Military logistics|logistical]] burden. Infantry are most easily deliverable forces to ground combat areas, by simple and reliable [[marching]], or by trucks, sea or air transport; they can also be inserted directly into combat by [[amphibious landing]], or for [[air assault]] by [[parachute]] or [[helicopter]] (\"airmobile\" or \"airborne\" infantry). They can be augmented with a variety of [[crew-served weapon]]s and [[armoured personnel carrier]]s.\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n[[File:Tafel Io.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Various infantry of the 17th through 18th century ([[halberdier]], [[arquebus]]ier, [[pikeman]], and mix of [[musketeer]]s and [[grenadier]]s) of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg]]]]\n[[File:M2 loading.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Infantry of the US [[3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment]] enter their [[M2 Bradley]] [[IFV]] during a combat patrol, [[Tall Afar]], Iraq, 2006]]\nIn English, use of the term ''infantry'' began about the 1570s, describing [[soldier]]s who march and fight on foot. The word derives from [[Middle French]] ''infanterie'', from older [[Italian language|Italian]] (also Spanish) ''infanteria'' (foot soldiers too inexperienced for cavalry), from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:infans|\u012bnf\u0101ns]]'' (without speech, newborn, foolish), from which English also gets ''[[wikt:infant|infant]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infantry|url=http://www.etymonline.com/word/infantry|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> The individual-soldier term '''infantryman''' was not coined until 1837.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infantryman|url=http://www.etymonline.com/word/infantryman|website=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> In modern usage, foot soldiers of any era are now considered infantry and infantrymen.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infantry|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/infantry|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-18th century until 1881 the [[British Army]] named its infantry as numbered regiments \"of Foot\" to distinguish them from [[cavalry]] and [[dragoon]] regiments (see [[List of Regiments of Foot]]).\n\nInfantry equipped with special weapons were often named after that weapon, such as [[grenadier]]s for their [[grenade]]s, or [[fusilier]]s for their ''fusils''.<ref group=note>A fusil was early [[flintlock]] firearm that was safer to use around the gunpowder stores of [[cannon]]s than [[matchlock]]s.</ref> These names can persist long after the weapon speciality; examples of infantry units that retained such names are the [[Royal Irish Fusiliers]] and the [[Grenadier Guards]].\n\nMore commonly in modern times, infantry with [[special forces|special tactics]] are named for their roles, such as [[commando]]s, [[United States Army Rangers|rangers]], [[sniper]]s, [[marines]], (who all have additional training) and [[militia]] (who have reduced training); they are still infantry due to their expectation to fight as infantry when they enter combat.\n\n[[Dragoon]]s were created as [[mounted infantry]], with horses for travel between battles; they were still considered infantry since they dismounted before combat. However, if [[light cavalry]] was lacking in an army, any available dragoons might be assigned their duties; this practise increased over time, and dragoons eventually received all the weapons and training as both infantry and cavalry, and could be classified as both. Conversely, starting about the mid-19th century, regular cavalry have been forced to spend more of their time dismounted in combat due to the ever-increasing effectiveness of enemy infantry firearms. Thus most cavalry transitioned to mounted infantry. As with grenadiers, the ''dragoon'' and ''cavalry'' designations can be retained long after their horses, such as in the [[Royal Dragoon Guards]], [[Royal Lancers]], and [[King's Royal Hussars]].\n\nSimilarly, [[motorised infantry]] have trucks and other unarmed vehicles for non-combat movement, but are still infantry since they leave their vehicles for any combat. Most modern infantry have vehicle transport, to the point where infantry being motorised is generally assumed, and the few exceptions might be identified as modern ''light infantry'', or \"leg infantry\" colloquially. [[Mechanised infantry]] go beyond motorised, having transport vehicles with combat abilities, [[armoured personnel carrier]]s (APCs), providing at least some options for combat without leaving their vehicles. In modern infantry, some APCs have evolved to be [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s (IFVs), which are transport vehicles with more substantial combat abilities, approaching those of [[light tank]]s. Some well-equipped mechanised infantry can be designated as ''armoured infantry''.  Given that infantry forces typically also have some tanks, and given that most armoured forces have more mechanised infantry units than tank units in their organisation, the distinction between mechanised infantry and armour forces has blurred.\n\nThe terms \"infantry\", \"armour\", and \"cavalry\" used in the official names for [[military unit]]s like [[Division (military)|divisions]], [[brigade]]s, or [[regiment]]s might be better understood as a description of their expected balance of defensive, offensive, and mobility roles, rather than just use of vehicles. Some modern mechanised infantry units are termed ''cavalry'' or ''[[armoured cavalry]]'', even though they never had horses, to emphasise their combat mobility.\n\nIn the modern [[US Army]], about 15% of soldiers are officially ''Infantry''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Molinaro|first1=Kristin|title=Infantry leaders sharpen training tactics to meet battlefield demands|url=https://www.army.mil/article/45200/infantry_leaders_sharpen_training_tactics_to_meet_battlefield_demands|website=The Bayonet|publisher=US Army|date=15 September 2010|accessdate=28 October 2017}}</ref> The [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]] for all new US Army soldiers includes use of infantry weapons and tactics, even for tank crews, artillery crews, and base and logistical personnel.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Greek soldiers of Greco\u2013Persian Wars.png|thumb|right|Ancient Greek infantry of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013449 BC): [[light infantry]] (left, [[Sling (weapon)|slinger]]), and the [[heavy infantry]] (middle and right, [[hoplite]]s)]]\n[[File:Rocroi, el \u00faltimo tercio, por Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau.jpg|thumb|''Rocroi, el \u00faltimo tercio'' (\"Roicroi, the last tercio\") by [[Augusto Ferrer-Dalmau]], portraying infantry of a battered Spanish [[tercio]] at the 1643 [[Battle of Rocroi]]]]\n[[File:French bayonet charge.jpg|thumb|French infantry line performing a bayonet charge in the early stages of [[World War I]]]]\n\n{{Main article|History of infantry}}\n\nThe first warriors, adopting [[hunting weapon#History|hunting weapons]] or improvised [[melee weapon]]s,<ref name=\"Kelly\">{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Raymond|date=October 2005|title=The evolution of lethal intergroup violence|journal=PNAS|volume=102|pages=24\u201329|doi=10.1073/pnas.0505955102|pmc=1266108|pmid=16129826}}</ref> before the existence of any organised military, likely started essentially as loose groups without any organisation or formation.

Even after, with a few exceptions like the [[Mongol Empire]], infantry has been the largest component of most armies in history.\n\nIn the [[Western world]], from [[Classical Antiquity]] through the [[Middle Ages]] ({{circa}} 8th century BC to 15th century AD), infantry are categorised as either [[heavy infantry]] or [[light infantry]]. Heavy infantry, such as Greek [[hoplite]]s, Macedonian [[phalangites]], and Roman [[legionaries]], specialised in [[Close order formation|dense, solid formations]] driving into the main enemy lines, using weight of numbers to achieve a [[decisive victory]], and were usually equipped with heavier [[weapon]]s and [[body armor|armour]] to fit their role. Light infantry, such as Greek [[peltasts]], Balearic [[Sling (weapon)|slingers]], and Roman [[velites]], using open formations and greater manoeuvrability, took on most other combat roles: [[Reconnaissance|scouting]], screening the army on the march, [[skirmishing]] to delay, disrupt, or weaken the enemy to prepare for the main forces' battlefield attack, protecting them from [[flanking maneuver|flanking manoeuvers]], and then afterwards either pursuing the fleeing enemy or covering their army's retreat.\n\nAfter the fall of Rome, the quality of heavy infantry declined, and warfare was dominated by [[heavy cavalry]],<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kagay|first1=Donald J.|last2=Villalon|first2=L. J. Andrew|title=The Circle of War in the Middle Ages|date=1999|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=9780851156453|page=53}}</ref> such as [[knight]]s, forming small elite units for decisive [[shock combat]], supported by peasant infantry [[militia]]s and assorted light infantry from the lower classes. Towards the end of Middle Ages, this began to change, where more professional and better trained light infantry could be effective against knights, such as the [[English longbow]]men in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. By the start of the [[Renaissance]], the infantry began to [[Infantry revolution|return to dominance]], with [[Swiss pikemen]] and German [[Landsknechts]] filling the role of heavy infantry again, using [[pike square|dense formations of pikes]] to drive off any cavalry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=Brian Todd|title=Warfare in the Medieval World|date=2006|publisher=Pen & Sword Military|location=London|isbn=9781848847415|page=chapter 6}}</ref>\n\nDense formations are vulnerable to ranged weapons. Technological developments allowed the raising of large numbers of light infantry units armed with ranged weapons, without the years of training expected for traditional high-skilled archers and slingers. This started slowly, first with [[crossbow]]men, then [[hand cannon]]eers and [[arquebus]]iers, each with increasing effectiveness, marking the beginning of [[early modern warfare]], when [[firearm]]s rendered the use of heavy infantry obsolete. The introduction of [[musketeer]]s using [[bayonet]]s in the mid 17th century began replacement of the pike with the [[infantry square]] replacing the pike square.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Archer|first1=Christon I.|title=World History of Warfare|date=1 January 2002|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803219410|page=291}}</ref>\n\nTo maximise their firepower, musketeer infantry were trained to fight in wide lines facing the enemy, creating [[line infantry]]. These fulfilled the central battlefield role of earlier heavy infantry, using ranged weapons instead of melee weapons. To support these lines, smaller infantry formations using dispersed [[skirmish line]]s were created, called light infantry, fulfilling the same multiple roles as earlier light infantry. Their arms were no lighter than line infantry; they were distinguished by their skirmish formation and flexible tactics.\n\nThe modern [[rifleman]] infantry became the primary force for taking and holding ground on battlefields worldwide, a vital element of [[combined arms]] combat. As firepower continued to increase, use of infantry lines diminished, until all infantry became light infantry in practice.\n\nModern classifications of infantry have expanded to reflect modern equipment and tactics, such as [[motorised infantry]], [[Mechanised infantry|mechanised or armoured infantry]], [[mountain infantry]], [[marine infantry]], and [[airborne infantry]].\n\n== Equipment ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:Feldk\u00fcche im Hof der Sekundarschule Spitalacker - CH-BAR - 3241487.tif|thumb|upright=1.2|Swiss infantry kits arrayed in front of a [[field kitchen]] in Spitalacker, [[Bern]] during a workers' strike, {{circa|1918}}]]\n[[File:Alice equipaggiamento3.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|US Army infantryman {{circa|1973}}]]\n[[File:Alice01a.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|right|US [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment|ALICE]] {{circa|1973}}]]\nAn infantryman's equipment is of vital concern both for the man and the military. The needs of the infantryman to maintain fitness and effectiveness must be constantly balanced against being overburdened. While soldiers in other military branches can use their mount or vehicle for carrying equipment, and tend to operate together as crews serving their vehicle or ordnance, infantrymen must operate more independently; each infantryman usually having much more personal equipment to use and carry. This encourages searching for ingenious combinations of effective, rugged, serviceable and adaptable, yet light, compact, and handy infantry equipment.\n\nBeyond their main arms and armour, each infantryman's \"military kit\" includes [[combat boot]]s, [[battledress]] or combat [[Military uniform|uniform]], [[camping gear]], heavy weather gear, [[Survival kit#Military kits|survival gear]], secondary weapons and [[ammunition]], weapon service and repair kits, health and hygiene items, [[Mess kit#Military mess kit|mess kit]], [[Field ration|rations]], filled [[Canteen (bottle)|water canteen]], and all other consumables each infantryman needs for the expected duration of time operating away from their unit's base, plus any special mission-specific equipment. One of the most valuable pieces of gear is the [[entrenching tool]]\u2014basically a folding [[spade]]\u2014which can be employed not only to dig important defences, but also in a variety of other daily tasks, and even sometimes as a weapon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Military kit through the ages: from the Battle of Hastings to Helmand|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-one/11011316/Military-kit-through-the-ages-from-the-Battle-of-Hastings-to-Helmand.html|website=The Telegraph|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> Infantry typically have shared equipment on top of this, like tents or heavy weapons, where the carrying burden is spread across several infantrymen.

Better infantry equipment to support their health, energy, and protect from environmental factors greatly reduces these rates of loss, and increase their level of effective action. Health, energy, and morale are greatly influenced by how the soldier is fed, so militaries often standardised field rations, starting from [[hardtack]], to US [[K-ration]]s, to modern [[MRE]]s.\n\nCommunications gear has become a necessity, as it allows effective command of infantry units over greater distances, and communication with artillery and other support units. Modern infantry can have [[GPS]], encrypted individual communications equipment, surveillance and night vision equipment, advanced intelligence and other high-tech mission-unique aids.\n\nArmies have sought to improve and standardise infantry gear to reduce fatigue for extended carrying, increase freedom of movement, accessibility, and compatibility with other carried gear, such as the US [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment]] (ALICE).\n\n=== Weapons ===\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n[[File:\u0420\u0438\u0441\u0443\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u043a \u0441\u0442\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0435 \u00ab\u0414\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043d\u0435-\u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435\u00bb. \u0412\u043a\u043b\u0435\u0439\u043a\u0430 \u2116 1. \u0412\u043e\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u044d\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043a\u043b\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0434\u0438\u044f \u0421\u044b\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430 (\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442-\u041f\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0431\u0443\u0440\u0433, 1911-1915).jpg|thumb|Russian weapons from the 13th to 17th centuries]]\nInfantrymen are defined by their primary arms \u2013 the [[personal weapons]] and [[body armour]] for their own individual use.

Such weapons are used when the primary weapon is no longer effective, such it becoming damaged, running out of ammunition, malfunction, or in a change of tactical situation where another weapon is preferred, such as going from ranged to close combat. Infantry with ranged or pole weapons often carried a sword or dagger for possible hand-to-hand combat.<ref name=\"Germany at War\" /> The ''[[pilum]]'' was a javelin of the Roman legionaries threw just before drawing their primary weapon, the ''[[gladius]]'' (short sword), and closing with the enemy line.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zhmodikov |first1=Alexander |title=Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte |chapter=Roman Republican Heavy Infantrymen in Battle (IV-II Centuries B.C.) |volume= 49 no. 1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |date=2000 |isbn=978-1598849806 |page=640 }}</ref>\n\nModern infantrymen now treat the bayonet as a backup weapon, but may also have [[handgun]]s or [[pistol]]s. They may also deploy anti-personnel mines, booby traps, incendiary or explosive devices defensively before combat.\n\nSome non-weapon equipment are designed for close combat shock effects, to get and psychological edge before melee, such as [[War flag|battle flag]]s, [[war drum]]s, brilliant [[Military uniform|uniforms]], fierce [[body paint]] or [[tattoo]]s, and even [[battle cry|battle cries]]. These have become mostly only ceremonial since the decline of close combat military tactics.\n\n=== Protection ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nInfantry have employed many different methods of protection from enemy attacks, including various kinds of armour and other gear, and tactical procedures.\n\nThe most basic is [[personal armour]]. This includes [[shield]]s, [[military helmet|helmets]] and many types of armour \u2013 [[Gambeson|padded linen]], leather, [[Lamellar armour|lamellar]], [[mail (armor)|mail]], [[plate armor|plate]], and [[kevlar]]. Initially, armour was used to defend both from ranged and close combat; even a fairly light shield could help defend against most slings and javelins, though high-strength bows and crossbows could penetrate most armour at very close range. Infantry armour had to compromises between protection and coverage, as a full suit of attack-proof armour would be too heavy to wear in combat.\n\nAs firearms improved, armour for ranged defence had to be thicker and stronger. With the introduction of the heavy arquebus to piece standard steel armour, it was proved easier to make heavier firearms than heavier armour; armour transitioned to be only for close combat purposes. Pikemen armour tended to be just steel helmets and breastplates, and gunners little or no armour. By the time of the musket, the dominance of firepower shifted militaries away from any close combat, and use of armour decreased, until infantry typically went without any armour.\n\nHelmets were added back during World War I as artillery began to dominate the battlefield, to protect against their [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] and other blast effects beyond a direct hit. Modern developments in bullet-proof composite materials like kevlar have started a return to body armour for infantry, though the extra weight is a notable burden.\n\nIn modern times, infantrymen must also often carry protective measures against [[chemical warfare|chemical]] and [[biological warfare|biological]] attack, including [[gas mask]]s, counter-agents, and protective suits. All of these protective measures add to the weight an infantryman must carry, and may decrease combat efficiency. Modern militaries are struggling to balance the value of personal body protection versus the weight burden and ability to move under such weight.\n\n=== Infantry-served weapons ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n\nEarly crew-served weapons were [[siege weapon]]s, like the [[ballista]], [[trebuchet]], and [[battering ram]]. Modern versions include [[machine guns]], [[anti-tank missiles]], and infantry [[mortar (weapon)|mortars]].\n\n== Formations ==\n[[File:Stele of Vultures detail 01a.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Ancient depiction of infantry formations, from the [[Stele of the Vultures]], [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)]], {{circa|2500 BC}}]]\n\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Tactical formation}}\n\nBeginning with the development the first regular military forces, close-combat regular infantry fought less as unorganised groups of individuals and more in coordinated units, maintaining a defined [[tactical formation]] during combat, for increased battlefield effectiveness; such infantry formations and the arms they used developed together, starting with the spear and the shield.\n\nA spear has decent attack abilities with the additional advantage keeping opponents at distance; this advantage can be increased by using longer spears, but this could allow the opponent to side-step the point of the spear and close for [[hand-to-hand combat]] where the longer spear is near useless. This can be avoided when each spearman stays side-by-side with the others in close formation, each covering the ones next to him, presenting a solid wall of spears to the enemy that they cannot get around.\n\nSimilarly, a shield has decent defence abilities, but is literally hit-or-miss; an attack from an unexpected angle can bypass it completely. Larger shields can cover more, but are also heavier and less manoeuvrable, making unexpected attacks even more of a problem. This can be avoided by having shield-armed soldiers stand close together, side-by-side, each protecting both themselves and their immediate comrades, presenting a solid [[shield wall]] to the enemy.\n\nThe opponents for these first formations, the close-combat infantry of more [[Tribal society|tribal societies]], or any military without regular infantry (so called \"[[barbarian]]s\") used arms that focused on the individual \u2013 weapons using personal strength and force, such as larger swinging swords, axes, and clubs. These take more room and individual freedom to swing and wield, necessitating a more loose organisation. While this may allow for a fierce running attack (an initial shock advantage) the tighter formation of the heavy spear and shield infantry gave them a local manpower advantage where several might be able to fight each opponent.\n\nThus tight formations heightened advantages of heavy arms, and gave greater local numbers in melee. To also increase their staying power, multiple rows of heavy infantrymen were added. This also increased their shock combat effect; individual opponents saw themselves literally lined-up against several heavy infantryman each, with seemingly no chance of defeating all of them. ''Heavy infantry'' developed into huge solid block formations, up to a hundred meters wide and a dozen rows deep.\n\nMaintaining the advantages of heavy infantry meant maintaining formation; this became even more important when two forces with heavy infantry met in battle; the solidity of the formation became the deciding factor. Intense discipline and training became paramount. Empires formed around their military.\n\n== Organization ==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}\n{{Main|Military organization}}\n\nThe organization of military forces into regular military units is first noted in Egyptian records of the [[Battle of Kadesh]] ({{circa|1274 BC}}). Soldiers were grouped into units of 50, which were in turn grouped into larger units of 250, then 1,000, and finally into units of up to 5,000 \u2013 the largest independent command. Several of these Egyptian \"divisions\" made up an army, but operated independently, both on the march and tactically, demonstrating sufficient military [[command and control]] organisation for basic battlefield manoeuvres. Similar hierarchical organizations have been noted in other ancient armies, typically with approximately 10 to 100 to 1,000 ratios (even where [[base 10]] was not common), similar to modern [[Section (military unit)|sections (squads)]], [[Company (military unit)|companies]], and [[regiment]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Centeno |first1=Miguel A. |last2=Enriquez |first2=Elaine |title=War and Society |date=31 March 2016 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-313-22348-8 |pages=81\u201384 |chapter=Origins of Battle}}</ref>\n\n== Training ==\n{{unreferenced section |date=October 2017}}\n\nThe training of the infantry has differed drastically over time and from place to place. The cost of maintaining an army in fighting order and the seasonal nature of warfare precluded large permanent armies.\n\nThe antiquity saw everything from the well-trained and motivated citizen armies of Greek and Rome, the tribal host assembled from farmers and hunters with only passing acquaintance with warfare and masses of lightly armed and ill-trained militia put up as a last ditch effort.\n\nIn medieval times the foot soldiers varied from peasant levies to semi-permanent companies of mercenaries, foremost among them the Swiss, English, [[Aragon]]ese and German, to men-at-arms who went into battle as well-armoured as knights, the latter of which at times also fought on foot.\n\nThe creation of [[standing army|standing armies]]\u2014permanently assembled for war or defence\u2014saw increase in training and experience. The increased use of firearms and the need for drill to handle them efficiently.\n\nThe introduction of national and mass armies saw an establishment of minimum requirements and the introduction of special troops (first of them the engineers going back to medieval times, but also different kinds of infantry adopted to specific terrain, bicycle, motorcycle, motorised and mechanised troops) culminating with the introduction of highly trained special forces during the first and second World War.\n\n== Combat role ==\nAs a branch of the [[armed forces]], the role of the infantry in warfare is to engage, fight, and kill the enemy at close range\u2014using either a firearm ([[rifle]], [[pistol]], [[machine gun]]), an edged-weapon ([[Fairbairn\u2013Sykes fighting knife|knife]], [[bayonet]]), or bare hands ([[Hand-to-hand combat|close quarters combat]])\u2014as required by the mission to hand; thus\n\n[[File:9 Div Tobruk(AWM 020779).jpg|thumb|right|20th-century infantry: Australian infantry at Tobruk, Libya, in 1941, during the [[Second World War]] (1939\u201345)]]\n* in the [[Australian Army]] and [[New Zealand Army]] the role of the infantry is \"to seek out and close with the enemy, to kill or capture him, to seize and hold ground, to repel attack, by day or night, regardless of season, weather or terrain\".<ref>[http://www.army.gov.au/stayarmy/RAINF.asp Royal Australian Corps of Infantry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110917153930/http://www.army.gov.au/stayarmy/RAINF.asp |date=17 September 2011 }} at www.army.gov.au</ref>\n* in the [[Canadian Army]], the role of the infantry is \"to close with, and destroy the enemy\".<ref>Canadian Forces Publication B-GL-392-001/FP-001 ''The Infantry Battalion in Battle'', Volume 1</ref><ref>Canadian Forces Publication B-GL-301-002/FP-001 The battle Group in Operations, Change 2, 1992-02-03.</ref>\n* in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], the \"infantry closes with the enemy, by means of fire and manoeuvre, in order to destroy or capture him, or to repel his assault by fire, close combat, and counterattack\".<ref>FM7-8, Infantry Rifle Platoon and Squad</ref>\n* in the [[U.S. Marine Corps]], the role of the infantry is to \"locate, close with, and destroy the enemy with fire and manoeuvre, and to repel the enemy assault by fire and close combat\".<ref>[[MOS 0311]]</ref>\n\nBeginning with the [[Napoleonic Wars]] of the early 19th century, artillery has become an increasingly dominant force on the battlefield. Since [[World War I]], combat aircraft and armoured vehicles have also become dominant. However, the most effective method for locating all enemy forces on a battlefield is still the infantry patrol, and it is the presence or absence of infantry that ultimately determines whether a particular piece of ground has been captured or held. In 20th and 21st century warfare, infantry functions most effectively as part of a [[combined arms]] team including artillery, armour, and combat aircraft. Studies have shown that of all casualties, 50% or more were caused by artillery; about 10% were caused by machine guns; 2\u20135% by rifle fire; and 1% or less by hand grenades, bayonets, knives, and unarmed combat combined.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Several infantry divisions both Allied and Axis in the European theatre of WWII suffered higher than 100% combat and non combat casualties and some above 200%, meaning that the number of service personnel that became casualties was greater than the sum of the divisions' available service positions at full strength.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\n== Operations ==\n{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n\n[[File:Calgary Highlanders Exercise Black Bear 2004.jpg|thumb|right|[[Primary Reserve|Canadian army reserve]] infantrymen train in urban operations]]\n\n===Attack operations===\nAttack operations are the most basic role of the infantry, and along with defence, form the main stances of the infantry on the battlefield. Traditionally, in an open battle, or [[meeting engagement]], two armies would manoeuvre to contact, at which point they would form up their infantry and other units opposite each other. Then one or both would advance and attempt to defeat the enemy force. The goal of an attack remains the same: to advance into an enemy-held ''objective,'' most frequently a hill, river crossing, city or other dominant terrain feature, and dislodge the enemy, thereby establishing control of the objective.\n\nAttacks are often feared by the infantry conducting them because of the high number of casualties suffered while advancing to close with and destroy the enemy while under enemy fire. In [[mechanised infantry]] the armoured personnel carrier (APC) is considered the assaulting position. These APCs can deliver infantrymen through the front lines to the battle and\u2014in the case of [[infantry fighting vehicle]]s\u2014contribute supporting firepower to engage the enemy. Successful attacks rely on sufficient force, preparative [[reconnaissance]] and battlefield preparation with bomb assets. Retention of discipline and cohesion throughout the attack is paramount to success. A subcategory of attacks is the [[ambush]], where infantrymen lie in wait for enemy forces before attacking at a vulnerable moment. This gives the ambushing infantrymen the combat advantage of surprise, concealment and superior firing positions, and causes confusion. The ambushed unit does not know what it is up against, or where they are attacking from.\n\n====Patrol operations====\n[[File:YON 642.jpg|thumb|[[Indonesian Army]] [[Indonesian Army Infantry Battalions|Infantry]] soldiers from the 642nd Infantry Battalion line up before deployment to the international Border of Indonesia and [[Papua New Guinea]] in 2013 for border patrol operations in dense forests and mountainous terrain]]\nPatrolling is the most common infantry mission. Full-scale attacks and defensive efforts are occasional, but patrols are constant. Patrols consist of small groups of infantry moving about in areas of possible enemy activity to locate the enemy and destroy them when found. Patrols are used not only on the front-lines, but in rear areas where enemy infiltration or insurgencies are possible.\n\n====Pursuit operations====\nPursuit is a role that the infantry often assumes. The objective of pursuit operations is the destruction of withdrawing enemy forces which are not capable of effectively engaging friendly units, before they can build their strength to the point where they are effective. Infantry traditionally have been the main force to overrun these units in the past, and in modern combat are used to pursue enemy forces in constricted terrain (urban areas in particular), where faster forces, such as armoured vehicles are incapable of going or would be exposed to ambush.\n\n===Defence operations===\nDefence operations are the natural counter to attacks, in which the mission is to hold an objective and defeat enemy forces attempting to dislodge the defender. Defensive posture offers many advantages to the infantry, including the ability to use terrain and constructed fortifications to advantage; these reduce exposure to enemy fire compared with advancing forces. Effective defence relies on minimising losses to enemy fire, breaking the enemy's cohesion before their advance is completed, and preventing enemy penetration of defensive positions.\n\n====Escort operations====\nEscorting consists of protecting support units from ambush, particularly from hostile infantry forces. Combat support units (a majority of the military) are not as well armed or trained as infantry units and have a different mission. Therefore, they need the protection of the infantry, particularly when on the move. This is one of the most important roles for the modern infantry, particularly when operating alongside armoured vehicles. In this capacity, infantry essentially conducts patrol on the move, scouring terrain which may hide enemy infantry waiting to ambush friendly vehicles, and identifying enemy strong points for attack by the heavier units.\n\n[[File:VanDoos Urban Warfare training.JPG|thumb|right|Canadian soldiers of the [[Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|Royal 22<sup>e</sup> R\u00e9giment]]]]\n\n====Base defence====\nInfantry units are tasked to protect certain areas like command posts or airbases. Units assigned to this job usually have a large number of military police attached to them for control of checkpoints and prisons.\n\n===Manoeuvring operations===\nManeouvering consumes much of an infantry unit's time. Infantry, like all combat arms units, are often manoeuvred to meet battlefield needs, and often must do so under enemy attack. The infantry must maintain their cohesion and readiness during the move to ensure their usefulness when they reach their objective. Traditionally, infantry have relied on their own legs for mobility, but mechanised or armoured infantry often uses trucks and armoured vehicles for transport. These units can quickly disembark and transition to light infantry, without vehicles, to access terrain which armoured vehicles can't effectively access.\n\n===Reconnaissance/intelligence gathering===\nSurveillance operations are often carried out with the employment of small recon units or sniper teams which gather information about the enemy, reporting on characteristics such as size, activity, location, unit and equipment. These infantry units typically are known for their stealth and ability to operate for periods of time within close proximity of the enemy without being detected. They may engage high-profile targets, or be employed to hunt down terrorist cells and insurgents within a given area. These units may also entice the enemy to engage a located recon unit, thus disclosing their location to be destroyed by more powerful friendly forces.\n\n===Military reserve force===\nSome assignments for infantry units involve deployment behind the front, although patrol and security operations are usually maintained in case of enemy infiltration. This is usually the best time for infantry units to integrate replacements into units and to maintain equipment. Additionally, soldiers can be rested and general readiness should improve. However, the unit must be ready for deployment at any point.\n\n===Construction/engineering===\n{{see also|Pioneer (military)}}\n\nThis can be undertaken either in reserve or on the front, but consists of using infantry troops as labor for construction of field positions, roads, bridges, airfields, and all other manner of structures. The infantry is often given this assignment because of the physical quantity of strong men within the unit, although it can lessen a unit's morale and limit the unit's ability to maintain readiness and perform other missions. More often, such jobs are given to specialist engineering corps.\n\n===Raids/hostage rescue===\nInfantry units are trained to quickly mobilise, infiltrate, enter and neutralise threat forces when appropriate combat intelligence indicates to secure a location, rescue or capture high-profile targets.\n\n===Urban combat===\nUrban combat poses unique challenges to the combat forces. It is one of the most complicated type of operations an infantry unit will undertake. With many places for the enemy to hide and ambush from, infantry units must be trained in how to enter a city, and systematically clear the buildings, which most likely will be booby trapped, in order to kill or capture enemy personnel within the city. Care must be taken to differentiate innocent civilians who often hide and support the enemy from the non-uniformed armed enemy forces. Civilian and military casualties both are usually very high.<ref>[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA326510 ''The United States Army's Preparedness to Conduct Urban Combat: A Strategic Priority'', pp. 2\u20133]</ref>\n\n== Day to day service ==\n[[File:Alarmposten1.jpg|thumb|left|[[German Army]] mechanised infantry ([[Panzergrenadier]]s) on an alert post during an exercise in 2006]]\n\nBecause of an infantryman's duties with firearms, explosives, physical and [[Combat stress reaction|emotional stress]], and physical violence, casualties and deaths are not uncommon in both war and in peacetime training or operations. It is a highly dangerous and demanding combat service; in World War II, military doctors concluded that even physically unwounded soldiers were psychologically worn out after about 200 days of combat.\n\nThe physical, mental, and environmental operating demands of the infantryman are high. All of the combat necessities such as ammunition, weapon systems, food, water, clothing, and shelter are carried on the backs of the infantrymen, at least in light role as opposed to mounted/mechanised. Combat loads of over 36&nbsp;kg (80&nbsp;lbs) are standard, and greater loads in excess of 45&nbsp;kg (100&nbsp;lbs) are very common.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htinf/articles/20120311.aspx|title=Infantry: The Weight Won't Go Away|work=strategypage.com|accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"medical dept\">{{cite web|url=http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/other_pub/LoadCarriagePDF.pdf|title=U.S. Army Medical Department Center & School Portal|work=army.mil|accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref> These heavy loads, combined with long foot patrols of over {{convert|40|km|miles|abbr=on}} a day, in any climate from {{convert|43|to|-29|C|F|abbr=on}} in temperature, require the infantryman to be in good physical and mental condition. Infantrymen live, fight and die outdoors in all types of brutal climates, often with no physical shelter. Poor climate conditions adds misery to this already demanding existence. Disease epidemics, frostbite, heat stroke, trench foot, insect and wild animal bites are common along with stress disorders and these have sometimes caused more casualties than enemy action.<ref name=\"medical dept\"/>\n\nInfantrymen are expected to continue with their combat missions despite the death and injury of friends, fear, despair, fatigue, and bodily injury.\n\n[[File:Rangervietnam1969.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army Rangers, Vietnam, 1969]]\n\nSome infantry units are considered [[Special Forces]]. The earliest Special Forces commando units were more highly trained infantrymen, with special weapons, equipment, and missions. Special Forces units recruit heavily from regular infantry units to fill their ranks.\n\nForeign and domestic militaries typically have a slang term for their infantrymen. In the U.S. military, the slang term among both Marine and Army infantrymen for themselves is \"grunt.\" In the British Army, they are the \"squaddies.\" The infantry is a small close-knit community, and the slang names are terms of endearment that convey mutual respect and shared experiences.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n== Air force and naval infantry ==\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 110501-F-XXXXX-214 - U.S. Air Force airmen survey the area during a routine patrol outside Bagram Airfield Afghanistan on May 1 2011.

The predecessor of the 80386 was the [[Intel 80286]], a [[16-bit]] processor with a [[memory segment|segment]]-based memory management and protection system. The 80386 added a [[32-bit]] architecture and a [[paging]] translation unit, which made it much easier to implement operating systems that used [[virtual memory]]. It also offered support for [[X86 debug register|register debugging]].\n\nThe 80386 featured three operating modes: real mode, protected mode and virtual mode. The [[protected mode]], which debuted in the 286, was extended to allow the 386 to address up to 4 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of memory. The all new [[virtual 8086 mode]] (or ''VM86'') made it possible to run one or more [[real mode]] programs in a protected environment, although some programs were not compatible.\n\nThe ability for a 386 to be set up to act like it had a [[flat memory model]] in protected mode despite the fact that it uses a segmented memory model in all modes would arguably be the most important feature change for the x86 processor family until [[AMD]] released [[x86-64]] in 2003.\n\nSeveral new instructions have been added to 386: BSF, BSR, BT, BTS, BTR, BTC, CDQ, CWDE, LFS, LGS, LSS, MOVSX, MOVZX, SETcc, SHLD, SHRD.\n\nTwo new segment registers have been added (FS and GS) for general-purpose programs, single Machine Status Word of 286 grew into eight [[Control register|control registers]] CR0\u2013CR7. [[X86 debug register|Debug registers]] DR0\u2013DR7 were added for hardware breakpoints. New forms of MOV instruction are used to access them.\n\nChief architect in the development of the 80386 was [[John H. Crawford]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/kits/bios/crawford.htm |title=Intel Fellow\u2014John H.

This kind of [[calling convention]] supports [[reentrancy (computing)|reentrant]] and [[recursion (computer science)|recursive]] code and has been used by Algol-like languages since the late 1950s. A flat memory model is assumed, specifically, that the DS and ES segments address the same region of memory.\n\n==Chip variants==\n\n===The 80386SX variant===\n[[File:i386SX.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A surface-mount version of Intel 80386SX processor in a [[Compaq]] Deskpro computer. It is non-upgradable.]]\n[[File:Intel 80386 SX die.JPG|200px|right|thumb|[[Die (integrated circuit)|Die]] of Intel 80386SX]]\n[[File:80386SL processor from 1990.jpg|200px|right|thumb|80386SL from 1990]]\n\nIn 1988, Intel introduced the '''80386SX''', most often referred to as the '''386SX''', a cut-down version of the 80386 with a 16-bit data bus mainly intended for lower-cost PCs aimed at the home, educational, and small-business markets, while the 386DX would remain the high-end variant used in workstations, servers, and other demanding tasks. The CPU remained fully 32-bit internally, but the 16-bit bus was intended to simplify circuit-board layout and reduce total cost.<ref>This was a similar approach to that used by Intel with the [[Intel 8088|8088]], a derivative of the Intel 8086, that was used in the original IBM PC.</ref> The 16-bit bus simplified designs but hampered performance. Only 24 pins were connected to the address bus, therefore limiting addressing to 16&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]],<ref>The 16 MB limit was similar to that of the [[Motorola 68000|68000]], a comparable processor.</ref> but this was not a critical constraint at the time. Performance differences were due not only to differing data-bus widths, but also due to performance-enhancing [[cache memory|cache memories]] often employed on boards using the original chip.\n\nThe original 80386 was subsequently renamed 80386DX to avoid confusion. However, Intel subsequently used the \"DX\" suffix to refer to the [[floating-point]] capability of the 80486DX. The 80387SX was an 80387 part that was compatible with the 386SX (i.e. with a 16-bit databus). The 386SX was packaged in a surface-mount [[Quad Flat Package|QFP]] and sometimes offered in a socket to allow for an upgrade.\n\n===The i386SL variant===\nThe '''i386SL''' was introduced as a power-efficient version for [[laptop computer]]s. The processor offered several power-management options (e.g. [[System Management Mode|SMM]]), as well as different \"sleep\" modes to conserve [[battery (electricity)|battery]] power. It also contained support for an external [[CPU cache|cache]] of 16 to 64 [[Kilobyte|kB]]. The extra functions and circuit implementation techniques caused this variant to have over 3 times as many [[transistor]]s as the i386DX. The i386SL was first available at 20&nbsp;MHz clock speed,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/micropro/proc1990.htm |title=Chronology of Microprocessors (1990-1992) |publisher=Islandnet.com |date= |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref> with the 25&nbsp;MHz model later added.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mueller |first=Scott |url=http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=130978&seqNum=27 |title=Microprocessor Types and Specifications > P3 (386) Third-Generation Processors |publisher=InformIT |date= |accessdate=September 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Business importance==\nThe first company to design and manufacture a PC based on the Intel 80386 was [[Compaq]]. By extending the 16/24-bit [[IBM PC/AT]] standard into a natively 32-bit computing environment, Compaq became the first third party to implement a major technical hardware advance on the PC platform. IBM was offered use of the 80386, but had manufacturing rights for the earlier [[80286]]. IBM therefore chose to rely on that processor for a couple more years. The early success of the Compaq 386 PC played an important role in legitimizing the PC \"clone\" industry and in de-emphasizing IBM's role within it.\n\nPrior to the 386, the difficulty of manufacturing microchips and the uncertainty of reliable supply made it desirable that any mass-market semiconductor be multi-sourced, that is, made by two or more manufacturers, the second and subsequent companies manufacturing under license from the originating company. The 386 was for ''a time'' (4.7 years) only available from Intel, since [[Andrew Grove|Andy Grove]], Intel's CEO at the time, made the decision not to encourage other manufacturers to produce the processor as [[second source]]s. This decision was ultimately crucial to Intel's success in the market.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} The 386 was the first significant microprocessor to be [[Single-source publishing|single-sourced]]. Single-sourcing the 386 allowed Intel greater control over its development and substantially greater profits in later years.\n\n[[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]] introduced its compatible [[Am386]] processor in March 1991 after overcoming legal obstacles, thus ending Intel's 4.7-year monopoly on 386-compatible processors. From 1991 IBM also manufactured 386 chips under license for use only in IBM PCs and boards.\n\n==Compatibles==\n[[File:KL IBM 80386DX.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Intel i386 packaged by IBM]]\n* The [[AMD]] [[Am386]]SX and Am386DX were almost exact clones of the 80386SX and 80386DX. Legal disputes caused production delays for several years, but AMD's 40&nbsp;MHz part eventually became very popular with computer enthusiasts as a low-cost and low-power alternative to the 25&nbsp;MHz 486SX. The power draw was further reduced in the \"notebook models\" (Am386 DXL/SXL/DXLV/SXLV), which could operate with 3.3&nbsp;V and were implemented in fully static [[CMOS]] circuitry.\n* [[Chips and Technologies]] Super386 38600SX and 38600DX were developed using [[reverse engineering]]. They sold poorly, due to some technical errors and incompatibilities, as well as their late appearance on the market. They were therefore short-lived products.\n* [[Cyrix]] [[486SLC|Cx486SLC]]/[[486DLC|Cx486DLC]] could be (simplistically) described as a kind of 386/486 hybrid chip that included a small amount of on-chip cache. It was popular among computer enthusiasts but did poorly with [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]s. The Cyrix Cx486SLC and Cyrix Cx486DLC processors were pin-compatible with 80386SX and 80386DX respectively. These processors were also manufactured and sold by [[Texas Instruments]].\n* [[IBM]] [[386SLC]] and [[486SLC]]/DLC were variants of Intel's design which contained a large amount of on-chip cache (8 kB, and later 16 kB). The agreement with Intel limited their use to IBM's own line of computers and upgrade boards only, so they were not available on the open market.\n\n==Early problems==\nIntel originally intended for the 80386 to debut at 16&nbsp;MHz. However, due to poor yields, it was instead introduced at 12&nbsp;MHz.\n\nEarly in production, Intel discovered a marginal circuit that could cause a system to return incorrect results from 32-bit multiply operations.  Not all of the processors already manufactured were affected, so Intel tested its inventory. Processors that were found to be bug-free were marked with a double [[sigma]] (\u03a3\u03a3), and affected processors were marked \"16 BIT S/W ONLY\". These latter processors were sold as good parts, since at the time 32-bit capability was not relevant for most users.  Such chips are now extremely rare and became collectible.\n\nThe [[X87#80387|i387]] math coprocessor was not ready in time for the introduction of the 80386, and so many of the early 80386 motherboards instead provided a socket and [[hardware logic]] to make use of an [[X87#80287|80287]]. In this configuration the FPU would operate asynchronously to the CPU, usually with a clock rate of 10&nbsp;MHz. The original Compaq Deskpro 386 is an example of such design. However, this was an annoyance to those who depended on floating-point performance, as the performance advantages of the 80387 over the 80287 were significant.\n\n<gallery>\nImage:Intel A80386-12.jpg | A very early 80386 at 12&nbsp;MHz (A80386-12), before the 32-bit multiply bug was found\nImage:Intel A80386-16 16 bit SW Only.jpg | An A80386-16 marked \"16 BIT S/W ONLY\" with the multiply bug\nImage:Intel A80386-16 \u03a3\u03a3.jpg | A bug-free A80386-16 marked \"\u03a3\u03a3\"\n</gallery>\n\n==Pin-compatible upgrades==\n[[File:KL Upgrade 386.jpg|150px|right|thumb|Typical 386 upgrade CPUs from Cyrix and Texas Instruments]]\nIntel later offered a modified version of its 80486DX in 80386 packaging, branded as the Intel [[RapidCAD]]. This provided an upgrade path for users with 80386-compatible hardware.  The upgrade was a pair of chips that replaced both the 80386 and 80387. Since the 80486DX design contained an [[Floating-point unit|FPU]], the chip that replaced the 80386 contained the floating-point functionality, and the chip that replaced the 80387 served very little purpose. However, the latter chip was necessary in order to provide the FERR signal to the mainboard and appear to function as a normal floating-point unit.\n\nThird parties offered a wide range of upgrades, for both SX and DX systems. The most popular ones were based on the Cyrix 486DLC/SLC core, which typically offered a substantial speed improvement due to its more efficient instruction pipeline and internal [[CPU cache#Multi-level caches|L1]] SRAM cache. The cache was usually 1 kB, or sometimes 8 kB in the TI variant. Some of these upgrade chips (such as the 486DRx2/SRx2) were marketed by Cyrix themselves, but they were more commonly found in kits offered by upgrade specialists such as Kingston, Evergreen and Improve-It Technologies. Some of the fastest CPU upgrade modules featured the IBM SLC/DLC family (notable for its 16 kB L1 cache), or even the Intel 486 itself. Many 386 upgrade kits were advertised as being simple drop-in replacements, but often required complicated software to control the cache or clock doubling. Part of the problem was that on most 386 motherboards, the [[A20 line]] was controlled entirely by the motherboard with the CPU being unaware, which caused problems on CPUs with internal caches. \n\nOverall, it was very difficult to configure upgrades to produce the results advertised on the packaging, and upgrades were often not very stable or not fully compatible.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Models and variants ==\n\n===Early 5 V models===\n\n==== 80386DX ====\n[[File:Intel i386DX 25.jpg|thumb|Intel 80386DX, 25 MHz]]\nOriginal version, released in October 1985.\n* Capable of working with 16- or 32-bit external busses\n* Cache: depends on mainboard\n* Package: [[Pin Grid Array|PGA]]-132 or PQFP-132\n* Process: First types [[CHMOS]] III, 1.5&nbsp;\u00b5m, later CHMOS IV, 1&nbsp;\u00b5m\n* Die size: 104&nbsp;mm\u00b2 (ca. 10&nbsp;mm \u00d7 10&nbsp;mm) in CHMOS III and 39&nbsp;mm\u00b2 (6&nbsp;mm \u00d7 6.5&nbsp;mm) in CHMOS IV.\n* Transistor count: 275,000<ref name=fpgafeat/>\n* Specified max clock: 12&nbsp;MHz (early models), later 16, 20, 25 and 33&nbsp;MHz\n\n[[File:Intel386sx a 50 Kc.jpg|right|thumb|80386SX 16 MHz]]\n\n==== RapidCAD ====\n{{Main|RapidCAD}}\nA specially packaged [[Intel 486]]DX and a dummy [[floating point unit]] (FPU) designed as pin-compatible replacements for an Intel 80386 processor and [[Intel 80387|80387]] FPU.\n\n=== Versions for embedded systems ===\n\n==== 80376 ====\n{{Main|Intel 80376}}\nThis was an embedded version of the 80386SX which did not support real mode and paging in the MMU.\n\n==== i386EX, i386EXTB and i386EXTC ====\n{{Main|Intel 80386EX}}\n[[File:KL Intel i386EX.jpg|thumb|Intel i386EXTC, 25 MHz]]\nSystem and power management and built in peripheral and support functions: Two 82C59A interrupt controllers; Timer, Counter (3 channels); Asynchronous [[Serial Input Output|SIO]] (2 channels); Synchronous [[Serial Input Output|SIO]] (1 channel); Watchdog timer (Hardware/Software); [[Parallel Input Output|PIO]].

Lyon]], two [[Princeton University]] students, in 1972. It satirizes aspects of the various programming languages at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.techworld.com.au/article/251892/-z_programming_languages_intercal?pp=1&fp=2&fpid=-1 |title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: INTERCAL |publisher=Techworld |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> as well as the proliferation of proposed language constructs and notations in the 1960s.\n\nThere are two currently maintained versions of INTERCAL: C-INTERCAL, maintained by [[Eric S. Raymond]],<ref name=\"esr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ |title=The INTERCAL Resources Page |publisher=Catb.org |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> and CLC-INTERCAL, maintained by Claudio Calvelli.<ref name=\"clc\">{{cite web |url=http://clc.intercal.org.uk/ |title=Clc-Intercal |publisher=Clc-Intercal |date=2010-04-01 |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121224003625/http://clc.intercal.org.uk/ |archivedate=2012-12-24 |df= }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nAccording to the original manual by the authors,<ref name=\"manual72\">{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716084816/http://oops.se/~urban/pit/intercal.ps | title = INTERCAL reference manual | url = http://oops.se/~urban/pit/intercal.ps | archivedate = 2011-07-16 | accessdate = 2012-03-10 }}</ref>\n\n{{quote|The full name of the compiler is \"Compiler Language With No Pronounceable Acronym,\" which is, for obvious reasons, abbreviated \"INTERCAL.\"}}\n\nThe original Princeton implementation used [[punched card]]s and the [[EBCDIC]] character set. To allow INTERCAL to run on computers using [[ASCII]], substitutions for two characters had to be made: $ substituted for \u00a2 as the ''mingle'' operator, \"represent[ing] the increasing cost of software in relation to hardware\", and ? was substituted for \u22bb as the unary [[exclusive-or]] operator to \"correctly express the average person's reaction on first encountering exclusive-or\".<ref name=\"manual72\"/> In recent versions of C-INTERCAL, the older operators are supported as alternatives; INTERCAL programs may now be encoded in [[ASCII]], [[Latin-1]], or [[UTF-8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://c.intercal.org.uk/manual/atvm81sp.htm|title=Princeton and Atari Syntax \u2013 C-INTERCAL 0.27 Revamped Instruction Manual|accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref>\n\n== Details ==\n\nINTERCAL was intended to be completely different from all other computer languages. Common operations in other languages have cryptic and redundant syntax in INTERCAL. From the INTERCAL Reference Manual:<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\n{{quote| It is a well-known and oft-demonstrated fact that a person whose work is incomprehensible is held in high esteem. For example, if one were to state that the simplest way to store a value of 65536 in a 32-bit INTERCAL variable is:\n\n<source lang=\"fortran\">\nDO :1 <- #0\u00a2#256\n</source>\n\nany sensible programmer would say that that was absurd. Since this is indeed the simplest method, the programmer would be made to look foolish in front of his boss, who would of course happen to turn up, as bosses are wont to do. The effect would be no less devastating for the programmer having been correct. }}\n\nINTERCAL has many other features designed to make it even more aesthetically unpleasing to the programmer: it uses statements such as \"READ OUT\", \"IGNORE\", \"FORGET\", and modifiers such as \"PLEASE\". This last keyword provides two reasons for the program's rejection by the compiler: if \"PLEASE\" does not appear often enough, the program is considered insufficiently polite, and the error message says this; if too often, the program could be rejected as excessively polite. Although this feature existed in the original INTERCAL compiler, it was undocumented.<ref name=\"manualick\"/>\n\nDespite the language's intentionally obtuse and wordy syntax, INTERCAL is nevertheless [[Turing-complete]]: given enough memory, INTERCAL can solve any problem that a [[Universal Turing machine]] can solve. Most implementations of INTERCAL do this very slowly, however. A [[Sieve of Eratosthenes]] benchmark, computing all prime numbers less than 65536, was tested on a [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARCstation 1]]. In C, it took less than half a second; the same program in INTERCAL took over seventeen hours.<ref name=\"stross\">{{cite news|title=Intercal -- the Language From Hell|url=http://catb.org/~esr/intercal/stross.html|first=Charles|last=Stross|authorlink=Charles Stross|date=September 1992|work=[[Computer Shopper (UK magazine)|Computer Shopper (UK)]]}}</ref>\n\n== Documentation ==\n[[File:INTERCAL Circuitous Diagram.svg|thumb|The \"circuitous diagram\" from the INTERCAL Reference Manual, purportedly to explain the operation of the \"select\" operator]]\n\nThe INTERCAL Reference Manual contains many paradoxical, nonsensical, or otherwise humorous instructions:\n\n{{quote| Caution! Under no circumstances confuse the mesh with the interleave operator, except under confusing circumstances! }}\n\nThe manual also contains a \"[[tonsil]]\", as explained in this footnote: \"4) Since all other reference manuals have [[appendix (organ)|Appendices]], it was decided that the INTERCAL manual should contain some other type of removable organ.\"<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\nThe INTERCAL manual gives unusual names to all non-alphanumeric [[ASCII]] characters: single and double quotes are \"sparks\" and \"rabbit ears\" respectively. (The exception is the [[ampersand]]: as the [[Jargon File]] states, \"what could be sillier?\") The assignment operator, represented as an equals sign (INTERCAL's \"half mesh\") in many other programming languages, is in INTERCAL a left-arrow, <code><-</code>, made up of an \"angle\" and a \"worm\", obviously read as \"gets\".\n\n== Syntax ==\n\nInput (using the <code>WRITE IN</code> instruction) and output (using the <code>READ OUT</code> instruction) do not use the usual formats; in INTERCAL-72, WRITE IN inputs a number written out as digits in English (such as SIX FIVE FIVE THREE FIVE), and READ OUT outputs it in \"butchered\" [[Roman numerals]].<ref name=\"manual72\"/> More recent versions have their own I/O systems.<ref name=\"clc\"/><ref name=\"manualick\"/>\n\nComments can be achieved by using the inverted statement identifiers involving NOT or N'T; these cause lines to be initially ABSTAINed so that they have no effect.<ref name=\"manual72\"/> (A line can be ABSTAINed from even if it doesn't have valid syntax; syntax errors happen at runtime, and only then when the line is un-ABSTAINed.)<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\n=== Data structures ===\n\nINTERCAL-72 (the original version of INTERCAL) had only four [[data type]]s: the 16-[[bit]] [[integer]] (represented with a <code>.</code>, called a \"spot\"), the 32-bit integer (<code>:</code>, a \"twospot\"), the [[Array data type|array]] of 16-bit integers (<code>,</code>, a \"tail\"), and the array of 32-bit integers (<code>;</code>, a \"hybrid\"). There are 65535 available variables of each type, numbered from <code>.1</code> to <code>.65535</code> for 16-bit integers, for instance. However, each of these variables has its own [[stack (data structure)|stack]] on which it can be pushed and popped (STASHed and RETRIEVEd, in INTERCAL terminology), increasing the possible complexity of data structures.<ref name=\"manual72\"/> More modern versions of INTERCAL have by and large kept the same data structures, with appropriate modifications; TriINTERCAL, which modifies the [[radix]] with which numbers are represented, can use a 10-[[trit (computing)|trit]] type rather than a 16-bit type,<ref name=\"manualick\"/> and CLC-INTERCAL implements many of its own data structures, such as \"classes and lectures\", by making the basic data types store more information rather than adding new types.<ref name=\"clc\"/> Arrays are dimensioned by assigning to them as if they were a [[scalar (computing)|scalar]] variable. Constants can also be used, and are represented by a <code>#</code> (\"mesh\") followed by the constant itself, written as a [[decimal]] number; only integer constants from 0 to 65535 are supported.<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\n=== Operators ===\n\nThere are only five operators in INTERCAL-72. Implementations vary in which characters represent which operation, and many accept more than one character, so more than one possibility is given for many of the operators.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ INTERCAL operators<ref name=\"clc\"/><ref name=\"manual72\"/><ref name=\"manualick\"/>\n|-\n! Operator\n! INTERCAL-72 characters\n! C-INTERCAL characters\n!

The operator is placed between the punctuation mark specifying a variable name or constant and the number that specifies which variable it is, or just inside grouping marks (i.e. one character later than it would be in programming languages like [[C (programming language)|C]].) SELECT and INTERLEAVE (which is also known as MINGLE) are infix binary operators; SELECT takes the bits of its first operand that correspond to \"1\" bits of its second operand and removes the bits that correspond to \"0\" bits, shifting towards the least significant bit and padding with zeroes (so 51 (1'''1'''0'''0'''1'''1''' in binary) SELECT 21 (10101 in binary) is 5 ('''101''' in binary)); MINGLE alternates bits from its first and second operands (in such a way that the least significant bit of its second operand is the least significant bit of the result). There is no operator precedence; grouping marks must be used to disambiguate the precedence where it would otherwise be ambiguous (the grouping marks available are <code>'</code> (\"spark\"), which matches another spark, and <code>\"</code> (\"rabbit ears\"), which matches another rabbit ears; the programmer is responsible for using these in such a way that they make the expression unambiguous).<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\n=== Control structures ===\n\nINTERCAL statements all start with a \"statement identifier\"; in INTERCAL-72, this can be <code>DO</code>, <code>PLEASE</code>, or <code>PLEASE DO</code>, all of which mean the same to the program (but using one of these too heavily causes the program to be rejected, an [[undocumented feature]] in INTERCAL-72 that was mentioned in the C-INTERCAL manual),<ref name=\"manualick\"/> or an inverted form (with <code>NOT</code> or <code>N'T</code> appended to the identifier).<ref name=\"manual72\"/> Backtracking INTERCAL, a modern variant, also allows variants using <code>MAYBE</code> (possibly combined with PLEASE or DO) as a statement identifier, which introduces a choice-point.<ref name=\"backtrack\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~malcolmr/intercal/backtracking.html |title=Backtracking in Intercal |publisher=Cse.unsw.edu.au |date=2006-04-11 |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> Before the identifier, an optional line number (an integer enclosed in parentheses) can be given; after the identifier, a percent chance of the line executing can be given in the format <code>%50</code>, which defaults to 100%.<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\nIn INTERCAL-72, the main control structures are NEXT, RESUME, and FORGET. <code>DO (''line'') NEXT</code> branches to the line specified, remembering the next line that would be executed if it weren't for the NEXT on a call stack (other identifiers than DO can be used on any statement, DO is given as an example); <code>DO FORGET ''expression''</code> removes ''expression'' entries from the top of the call stack (this is useful to avoid the error that otherwise happens when there are more than 80 entries), and <code>DO RESUME ''expression''</code> removes ''expression'' entries from the call stack and jumps to the last line remembered.<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\nC-INTERCAL also provides the [[COME FROM]] instruction, written <code>DO COME FROM (''line'')</code>; CLC-INTERCAL and the most recent C-INTERCAL versions also provide computed COME FROM (<code>DO COME FROM ''expression'')</code> and NEXT FROM, which is like COME FROM but also saves a return address on the NEXT STACK.<ref name=\"clc\"/>\n\nAlternative ways to affect program flow, originally available in INTERCAL-72, are to use the IGNORE and REMEMBER instructions on variables (which cause writes to the variable to be silently ignored and to take effect again, so that instructions can be disabled by causing them to have no effect), and the ABSTAIN and REINSTATE instructions on lines or on types of statement, causing the lines to have no effect or to have an effect again respectively.<ref name=\"manual72\"/>\n\n=== Hello, world ===\n\nThe traditional [[Hello world program|\"Hello, world!\" program]] demonstrates how different INTERCAL is from standard programming languages.

The algorithm was intended as a replacement for the [[Data Encryption Standard]] (DES). IDEA is a minor revision of an earlier [[cipher]] Proposed Encryption Standard (PES).\n\nThe cipher was designed under a research contract with the Hasler Foundation, which became part of Ascom-Tech AG. The cipher was patented in a number of countries but was freely available for non-commercial use. The name \"IDEA\" is also a [[trademark]]. The last [[patent]]s expired in 2012, and IDEA is now patent-free and thus completely free for all uses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?locale=de_EP&CC=EP&NR=0482154 |title=Espacenet - Bibliografische Daten |language=de |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?locale=de_EP&CC=US&NR=5214703 |title=Espacenet - Bibliografische Daten |language=de |publisher=Worldwide.espacenet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref>\n\nIDEA was used in [[Pretty Good Privacy]] (PGP) v2.0 and was incorporated after the original cipher used in v1.0, [[BassOmatic]], was found to be insecure.<ref>{{Citation | last = Garfinkel | first = Simson | authorlink = Simson Garfinkel | title = PGP: Pretty Good Privacy | publisher = [[O'Reilly Media]] | date = December 1, 1994 | location = | pages = 101&ndash;102 | isbn = 978-1-56592-098-9 | postscript = .}}</ref> IDEA is an optional algorithm in the [[OpenPGP]] standard.\n\n==Operation==\nIDEA operates on 64-bit [[block size (cryptography)|blocks]] using a 128-bit [[key (cryptography)|key]] and consists of a series of 8 identical transformations (a ''round'', see the illustration) and an output transformation (the ''half-round''). The processes for encryption and decryption are similar. IDEA derives much of its security by interleaving operations from different [[group (mathematics)|groups]] &mdash; [[modular arithmetic|modular]] addition and multiplication, and bitwise [[XOR|eXclusive OR (XOR)]] &mdash; which are algebraically \"incompatible\" in some sense. In more detail, these operators, which all deal with 16-bit quantities, are:\n* Bitwise [[XOR]] (exclusive OR) (denoted with a blue circled plus <big><big>{{fontcolor|blue|\u2295}}</big></big>).\n* Addition modulo 2<sup>16</sup> (denoted with a green boxed plus <big><big>{{fontcolor|#0F0|\u229e}}</big></big>).\n* Multiplication modulo 2<sup>16</sup> + 1, where the all-zero word (0x0000) in inputs is interpreted as 2<sup>16</sup>, and 2<sup>16</sup> in output is interpreted as the all-zero word (0x0000) (denoted by a red circled dot <big><big>{{fontcolor|red|\u2299}}</big></big>).\n\nAfter the 8 rounds comes a final \u201chalf-round\u201d, the output transformation illustrated below (the swap of the middle two values cancels out the swap at the end of the last round, so that there is no net swap):\n:[[Image:International Data Encryption Algorithm InfoBox Diagram Output Trans.png|300px]]\n\n===Structure===\nThe overall structure of IDEA follows the [[Lai\u2013Massey scheme]]. XOR is used for both subtraction and addition. IDEA uses a key-dependent half-round function. To work with 16-bit words (meaning 4 inputs instead of 2 for the 64-bit block size), IDEA uses the Lai\u2013Massey scheme twice in parallel, with the two parallel round functions being interwoven with each other. To ensure sufficient diffusion, two of the sub-blocks are swapped after each round.\n\n===Key schedule===\nEach round uses 6 16-bit sub-keys, while the half-round uses 4, a total of 52 for 8.5 rounds.  The first 8 sub-keys are extracted directly from the key, with K1 from the first round being the lower 16 bits; further groups of 8 keys are created by rotating the main key left 25 bits between each group of 8. This means that it is rotated less than once per round, on average, for a total of 6 rotations.\n\n===Decryption===\nDecryption works like encryption, but the order of the round keys is inverted, and the subkeys for the odd rounds are inversed. For instance, the values of subkeys K1\u2013K4 are replaced by the inverse of K49\u2013K52 for the respective group operation, K5 and K6 of each group should be replaced by K47 and K48 for decryption.\n\n==Security==\nThe designers analysed IDEA to measure its strength against [[differential cryptanalysis]] and concluded that it is immune under certain assumptions. No successful [[linear cryptanalysis|linear]] or algebraic weaknesses have been reported.  {{As of|2007}}, the best attack applied to all keys could break IDEA reduced to 6 rounds (the full IDEA cipher uses 8.5 rounds).<ref name=\"idea-cryptanalysis\">\n{{cite news\n| author = Biham, E.\n| authorlink = Eli Biham\n| author2 = Dunkelman, O.\n| author3 = Keller, N.\n| title = A New Attack on 6-Round IDEA\n| url = http://www.cosic.esat.kuleuven.be/publications/article-920.ps\n| booktitle = Proceedings of Fast Software Encryption, 2007, Lecture Notes in Computer Science\n| publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]\n}}</ref>  Note that a \"break\" is any attack that requires less than 2<sup>128</sup> operations; the 6-round attack requires 2<sup>64</sup> known plaintexts and 2<sup>126.8</sup> operations.\n\n[[Bruce Schneier]] thought highly of IDEA in 1996, writing: \"In my opinion, it is the best and most secure block algorithm available to the public at this time.\" (''Applied Cryptography'', 2nd ed.)

Indoor rowing has become established as a sport in its own right. The term also refers to a participant in this sport.\n\nModern indoor rowers are often known as '''ergometer'''s (colloquially '''erg''' or '''ergo'''), an ergometer being a device which measures the amount of [[mechanical work|work]] performed. The indoor rower is calibrated to measure the amount of energy the rower is using through their use of the equipment.\n\n==History==\n \n[[Chabrias]], an Athenian admiral of the 4th century BC, introduced the first rowing machines as supplemental military training devices. \"To train inexperienced oarsmen, Chabrias built wooden rowing frames on shore where beginners could learn technique and timing before they went on board ship.\" <ref>John R. Hale, ''\"Lords of the Sea: The Epic Story of the Athenian Navy and the Birth of Democracy\"''</ref>\n\nEarly rowing machines are known to have existed from the mid-1800s, a US patent being issued to W.B. Curtis in 1872 for a particular hydraulic based damper design. Machines using linear pneumatic resistance were common around 1900\u2014one of the most popular was the Narragansett hydraulic rower, manufactured in Rhode Island from around 1900\u20131960.<ref name=rowingnews>{{citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=M0sEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = The Independent Rowing News | date = 22 February 2002 | accessdate = 3 February 2012 }}</ref> However they did not simulate actual rowing very accurately nor measure power output.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, coaches in many countries began using specially made rowing machines for training and improved [[Power (physics)|power]] measurement. One original design incorporated a large, heavy, solid iron flywheel with a mechanical friction [[brake]], developed by John Harrison of Leichhardt Rowing Club in Sydney, later to become a professor of mechanical engineering at the University of New South Wales. Harrison, a dual Australian champion beach sprinter who went on to row in the [[coxless four]] at the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Olympics]], had been introduced to rowing after a chance meeting with one of the fathers of modern athletic physiological training and testing, and the coach of the Leichhardt ''Guinea Pigs'', Professor [[Frank Cotton]]. Professor Cotton had produced a rudimentary friction-based machine for evaluating potential rowers by exhausting them, without any pretence of accurately measuring power output. Harrison realised the importance of using a small braking area with a non-absorbent braking material, combined with a large flywheel. The advantage of this design (produced by Ted Curtain Engineering, Curtain being a fellow Guinea Pig) was the virtual elimination of factors able to interfere with accurate results\u2014for instance ambient humidity or temperature. The Harrison-Cotton machine represents the very first piece of equipment able to accurately quantify human power output; power calculation within an accuracy range as achieved by his machine of less than 1% remains an impressive result today. The friction brake was adjusted according to a rower's weight to give an accurate appraisal of boat-moving ability (drag on a boat is proportional to weight). Inferior copies of Harrison's machine were produced in several countries utilising a smaller flywheel and leather straps\u2014unfortunately the leather straps were sensitive to humidity, and the relatively large braking area made results far less accurate than Harrison's machine. The weight correction factor tended to make them unpopular among rowers of the time. Harrison, arguably the father of modern athletic power evaluation, died in February 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=44|title=The Official World Rowing Web Site - Rowing / Ergometer/Indoor|first=WebSide Associates|last=SA|website=wayback.archive.org|accessdate=15 May 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110031520/http://www.worldrowing.com/index.php?pageid=44|archivedate=10 November 2006|df=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gjessing rowing ergometer.jpg|thumb|left|Gjessing-Nilson rowing ergometer, showing helical pulley and flywheel]]\nIn the 1970s, the Gjessing-Nilson ergometer from [[Norway]] used a friction brake mechanism with industrial strapping applied over the broad rim of the flywheel. Weights hanging from the strap ensured that an adjustable and predictable friction could be calculated. The cord from the handle mechanism ran over a helical pulley with varying radius, thereby adjusting the gearing and speed of the handle in a similar way to the changing mechanical gearing of the oar through the stroke, derived from changes in oar angle and other factors. This machine was for many years the internationally accepted standard for measurement.\n\nThe first [[air resistance]] ergometers were introduced around 1980 by [[Repco]].\n\nIn 1981, Peter and Richard Dreissigacker, and Jonathan Williams, filed for U.S. patent protection, as joint inventors of a \"Stationary Rowing Unit\". The patent was granted in 1983 (US4396188A). The first commercial embodiment of the [[Concept2]] \"rowing ergometer\" (as it came to be known) was the Model A, a fixed-frame sliding-seat design using a bicycle wheel with fins attached for air resistance. The Model B, introduced in 1986, introduced a solid cast flywheel (now enclosed by a cage) and the first digital performance monitor, which proved revolutionary. This machine's capability of accurate calibration combined with easy transportability spawned the sport of competitive indoor rowing, and revolutionised training and selection procedures for watercraft rowing. Later models were the C (1993) and D (2003). <ref name=rowingnews/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rowinghistory.net/Equipment.htm|title=RowHist-Equipment|website=www.rowinghistory.net|accessdate=15 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Casper Rekers, a Dutch engineer, was granted a U.S. patent for a \"Dynamically Balanced Rowing Simulator\" (US5382210A). This device differed from the prior art in that the flywheel and footrests are fixed to a carriage, the carriage being free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame. The seat is also free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the frame. From the patent Abstract: \"During exercise, the independent seat and energy dissipating unit move apart and then together in a co-ordinated manner as a function of the stroke cycle of the oarsman.\".  \"RowPerfect\" and \"Oartec\" are two companies which currently manufacture commercial embodiments of the Rekers device.\n\n==Design summary==\n\nAll rowing-machine designs consist of an energy damper or braking mechanism connected to a chain, strap, belt and/or handle. Footrests are attached to the same mounting as the energy damper. Most include a rail which either the seat or the mechanism slide upon. Different machines have a variety of layouts and damping mechanisms, each of which have certain advantages and disadvantages.\n\nCurrently available ergometer (flywheel-type) rowing machines use a spring or elastic cord to take up the pull chain/strap and return the handle. Advances in elastic cord and spring technology have contributed to the longevity and reliability of this strategy, but it still has disadvantages. With time and usage, an elastic element loses its strength and elasticity. Occasionally it will require adjustment, and eventually it will no longer take up the chain with sufficient vigour, and will need to be replaced. The resilience of an elastic cord is also directly proportional to temperature. In an unheated space in a cold climate, an elastic cord equipped rowing ergometer is unusable because the chain take-up is too sluggish. Thus, as the result of several factors, the force required to stretch the elastic cord is a variable, not a constant. This is of little consequence if the exercise device is used for general fitness, but it is an unacknowledged problem, the \"dirty little secret\", of indoor rowing competitions. The electronic monitor only measures the user input to the flywheel. It does not measure the energy expenditure to stretch the elastic cord. A claim of a \"level playing field\" cannot be made when a resistance variable exists (that of the elastic cord) which is not measured or monitored in any way (see more on this in \"Competitions\" section).\n\nIn the patent record, means are disclosed whereby the chain/cable take-up and handle return are accomplished without the use of a spring or elastic cord, thereby avoiding the stated disadvantages and defects of this broadly used method. One example is the Gjessing-Nilson device described above. Partially discernable in the thumbnail photo, it utilizes a cable wrapped around a helical pulley on the flywheel shaft, the ends of this cable being connected to opposite ends of a long pole to which a handle is fixed. The obvious disadvantage of this system is the forward space requirement to accommodate the extension of the handle pole at the \"catch\" portion of the stroke. The advantage is that, except for small transmission losses, all of the user's energy output is imparted to the flywheel, where it can be accurately measured, not split between the flywheel and an elastic cord of variable, unmeasured resistance. If a similar system were installed on all rowing ergometers used in indoor rowing competitions, consistency between machines would be guaranteed because the variability factor of elastic cord resistance would be eliminated, and this would therefore ensure that the monitor displayed actual user energy input. \n\nIn a 1988 US patent (US4772013A), Elliot Tarlow discloses another non-elastic chain/cable take-up and handle return strategy. Described and depicted is a continuous chain/cable loop that passes around the flywheel sprocket and around and between fixed pulleys and sprockets positioned fore and aft on the device. The handle is secured in the middle of the exposed upper horizontal section of the chain/cable loop. Although somewhat lacking in aesthetics, the Tarlow device does eliminate the stated disadvantages and defects of the ubiquitous elastic cord handle return. Tarlow further argues that the disclosed method provides an improved replication of rowing because in actual rowing the rower is not assisted by the contraction of a spring or elastic cord during the \"recovery\" portion of the stroke. The rower must push the oar handle forward against wind and oarlock resistance in preparation for the next stroke. Tarlow asserts that the invention replicates that resistance.\n\nA third non-elastic handle return strategy is disclosed in US patent, \"Gravity Return Rowing Exercise Device\" (US9878200 B2, 2018) granted to Robert Edmondson. As stated in the patent document, the utilization of gravity (ie: a weight) to take up the chain and return the handle eliminates the inevitable variability of handle return force associated with an elastic cord system and thereby ensures consistency between machines.\n\nMachines with a digital display calculate the user's power by measuring the speed of the flywheel during the stroke and then recording the rate at which it decelerates during the recovery. Using this and the known [[moment of inertia]] of the flywheel, the computer is able to calculate speed, power, distance and energy usage. Some ergometers can be connected to a personal computer using software, and data on individual exercise sessions can be collected and analysed. In addition, some software packages allows users to connect multiple ergometers either directly or over the internet for virtual races and workouts.\n\n===Motion type===\n\nAt the current state of the art, indoor rowers which utilize flywheel resistance can be categorized into two motion types. In both types, the rowing movement of the user causes the footrests and the seat to move further and closer apart in co-ordination with the user's stroke. The difference between the two types is in the movement, or absence of movement, of the footrests relative to ground.\n\nThe first type is characterized by the Dreissigacker/Williams device (referenced above). With this type the flywheel and footrests are fixed to a stationary frame, and the seat is free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the stationary frame. Therefore, during use, the seat moves relative to the footrests and also relative to ground, while the flywheel and footrests remain stationary relative to ground. This type is sometimes referred to as a \"stationary\" or \"fixed head\" rowing ergometer.\n\nThe second type is characterized by the Rekers device (referenced above). With this type, both the seat and the footrests are free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to a stationary frame. Therefore, during use, the seat and the footrests move relative to each other, and both also move relative to ground. This type is often referred to as a \"dynamic\" rowing ergometer, although \"dynamically balanced\" would be a more accurate description. A static indoor rower of the Dreissigacker/Williams type, if mounted on wheels or slides to enable forward and rearward movement of the unit, is by definition \"dynamically balanced\". The accessory slide tracks correspond to the referenced stationary frame of the Rekers device. Casper Rekers is nevertheless credited as the first to utilize this motion type in a rowing ergometer. The effect, for the user, is a more realistic \"on the water\" sensation than that provided by a \"stationary\" rowing ergometer because the \"dynamically balanced\" type more closely replicates actual rowing wherein the seat and the boat move relative to each other, and both move relative to the water.\n\nIncluded within the \"dynamically balanced\" category are indoor rowers in which the footrests and flywheel are fixed to a moveable carriage, and also those in which the footrests alone are fixed to the moveable carriage, the carriage in both cases being free to slide fore and aft on a rail or rails integral to the stationary frame. The described device in which the flywheel is fixed to and moves with the carriage and footrests (the Rekers design) is sometimes referred to as a \"floating head\" rowing ergometer.\n\nIndoor rowers which utilize a pivoting handle or handles to simulate a sweep or sculling stroke (thus referred to as \"rowing simulators\"), can be of the above described \"stationary\" or \"dynamically balanced\" type of rowing ergometer. The Coffey rowing machine, designed by Olympic silver medalist rower, Calvin Coffey, can be configured to enable a sweep or a sculling stroke, in either a \"stationary\" or \"dynamically balanced\" mode. The flywheel is positioned horizontally at the rear of the device, under the seat rails (US patents: US4743011A 1988; US7862484B1; Inventor: Calvin Coffey). \n\nThe Rekers rowing ergometer (referenced above) is described in the title of the patent document as \"dynamically balanced\", rather than simply \"dynamic\", as is common among users. \"Dynamically balanced\" is the accurate description, for the following reason:  During the drive portion of the stroke, since the sliding carriage to which the footrests are attached, and the sliding seat, can both move independently fore and aft on a rail or rails, therefore the straightening of the user's legs causes the footrests to slide forward, and simultaneously causes the seat to slide rearward. However, since the combined mass of the seat and user is considerably greater than the combined mass of the footrests and sliding carriage (and flywheel, if it is part of the sliding footrests assembly), therefore the rearward movement of the seat and user, relative to ground, is much less than the forward movement of the footrests and carriage assembly, relative to ground. During the recovery portion of the stroke, this difference in mass has the same effect. The sliding footrests carriage, and the sliding seat carrying the user move proportionately the same distances relative to ground as during the drive as they return to their starting positions. Thus, during use, the combined mass of the footrest and sliding carriage, and the combined mass of the user and sliding seat, move towards and away from each other, as they oscillate about their common centre of gravity. To ensure the linked movement of these two masses remain centred on the device, the rail or rails upon which they slide are sloped upward slightly at their front and rear ends. Alternatively, elastic cords or springs attached to the seat and footrests can ensure such centering. \n\nIn addition to the aforementioned improved \"on the water\" sensation experienced by the user of a \"dynamically balanced\" rowing ergometer, there are also bio-mechanical and power delivery advantages. Bio-mechanically, throughout all phases of the stroke, the user's mass moves only a small distance relative to ground, therefore the user is not subject to the inertial stresses associated with the abrupt fore and aft directional changes experienced on a \"stationary\" rowing ergometer. With respect to power delivery: Casper Rekers, inventor of the \"dynamically balanced\" rowing ergometer, \"performed tests comparing the indicated power output of a \"stationary\" versus a \"dynamic\" rowing ergometer - the subject gained 10-20% power output in the second case, representing additional power that could be applied to the flywheel instead of accelerating the bodyweight\" of the user on the seat rail.<ref>\"The Physics of Ergometers\" Anu Dudhia, Dept. of Physics, University of Oxford</ref>\n\n===Damper type===\n\n'''Piston resistance''' comes from hydraulic cylinders that are attached to the handles of the rowing machine.<ref name= \"guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rowingmachine-guide.com/types.html|title=Rowing Machine Resistance Types|website=Rowing Machine Reviews 2017|accessdate=7 August 2017}}</ref> The length of the rower handles on this class of rower is typically adjustable, however, during the row the handle length is fixed which in turn fixes the trajectory that the hands must take on the stroke and return, thus making the stroke less accurate than is possible on the other types of resistance models where it is possible to emulate the difference in hand height on the stroke and return. Furthermore, many models in this class have a fixed seat position that eliminates the leg drive which is the foundation of competitive on water rowing technique. Because of the compact size of the pistons and mechanical simplicity of design, these models are typically not as large or as expensive as the others types.\n\n'''Braked flywheel resistance''' models comprise magnetic, air and water resistance rowers. These machines are mechanically similar since all three types use a handle connected to a flywheel by rope, chain, or strap to provide resistance to the user&nbsp;\u2013 the types differ only in braking mechanism. Because the handle is attached to the resistance source by rope or similarly flexible media, the trajectory of the hands in the vertical plane is free making it possible for the rower to emulate the hand height difference between the stroke and the return. Most of these models have the characteristic sliding seat typical of competitive on-the-water boats.\n\n:'''Magnetic resistance''' models control resistance by means of permanent magnets or electromagnets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestrong.com/article/321644-air-vs-magnetic-rowing-machine/|title=Air Vs. Magnetic Rowing Machine|first=Heather M. J.|last=Emerson|publisher=|accessdate=7 August 2017}}</ref><ref name= \"guide\"/> A rotary plate, made of non-magnetic, electrical conducting material such as aluminum or copper, and either integral with, or independent of the flywheel, cuts through the magnetic field of the permanent magnet or the electromagnet, resulting in induced eddy currents which generate a retarding force that opposes the motion of the rotary plate. Resistance is adjusted with the permanent magnet system by changing the position of the permanent magnet relative to the rotary plate. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US6328677B1/en|title=Simulated-kayak, upper-body aerobic exercise machine </ref> <ref> 1991 US Patent 5076573A \"Magnetic Resistance Type Stationary Rowing Unit\" </ref> Resistance is adjusted with the electromagnetic system by varying the strength of the electromagnetic field through which the rotary plate moves. <ref> 1995 US Patent 5656001A \"Eddy Current Trainer...\" </ref> The magnetic braking system is quieter than the other braked flywheel types and energy can be accurately measured on this type of rower. The drawback of this type of resistance mechanism is that the resistance is constant for any given setting. Rowers using air or water resistance more accurately simulate actual rowing, where the resistance increases the harder the handle is pulled. Some rowing machines incorporate both air and magnetic resistance.\n\n:'''Air resistance''' models use vanes on the flywheel to provide the flywheel braking needed to generate resistance.<ref name= \"guide\"/> As the flywheel is spun faster, the air resistance increases. An adjustable vent can be used to control the volume of air moved by the vanes of the rotating flywheel, therefore a larger vent opening results in a higher resistance, and a smaller vent opening results in a lower resistance. The energy dissipated can be accurately calculated given the known [[moment of inertia]] of the flywheel and a tachometer to measure the deceleration of the flywheel. Air resistance rowing machines are most often used by sport rowers (particularly during the off season and inclement weather) and competitive indoor rowers. RowPerfect, Oartec, and Concept 2, are three manufacturers of this type of rowing machine.\n\n:'''Water resistance''' models consist of a paddle revolving in an enclosed tank of water.<ref name= \"guide\"/> The mass and drag of the moving water creates the resistance. Proponents claim that this approach results in a more realistic action than possible with air or magnetic type machines. \"WaterRower\" was the first company to manufacturer this type of rowing machine. The company was formed in the 1980's by John Duke, a US National Team rower, and inventor of the device (1989 US Patent US4884800A). At that time, in the patent record, there were a few prior art fluid resistance rowing machines, but they lacked the simplicity and elegance of the Duke design. From the 1989 patent Abstract: \"... rowing machine features a hollow container that holds a supply of water. Pulling on a drive cord during a pulling segment of a stroke rotates a paddle or like mechanism within the container to provide a momentum effect.\"\n\n:'''Rheological fluid resistance''': In the patent record various exercise devices, including rowing machines, are depicted and described utilizing flywheels in which rotational resistance is controlled by varying the viscosity of a magnetically or electrically reactive fluid (magnetorheological or electrorheological fluid). It seems probable therefore that at some time commercially available rowing machines will include those with flywheels containing variable viscosity fluid.\n\nRowing machines with monitors calculate performance using an algorithm unique to the individual manufacturer; it will be affected by the type of resistance used and other factors.\n\n==Exercise==\n\nIndoor rowing primarily works the cardiovascular systems with typical workouts consisting of steady pieces of 20\u201340 minutes, although the standard trial distance for record attempts is 2000 m, which can take from five and a half minutes (best elite rowers) to nine minutes or more. Like other forms of cardio focused exercise, [[interval training]] is also commonly used in indoor rowing. While cardio-focused, rowing also stresses many muscle groups throughout the body anaerobically, thus rowing is often referred to as a [[strength training|strength-endurance sport]].\n\nUnlike high impact exercises, which can damage knees and the connective tissues of the lower body, rowing's most common injury site is the lower back. Proper technique is a necessity for staying injury free, with a focus on both mechanics and breathing, as correct rhythm, exhaling on the drive and inhaling on the recovery, is a stabilizing force for the upper body. Non-rowers commonly overemphasize the muscles of the upper body, while correct technique uses the large muscle of the thighs to drive much of the stroke. Also, good technique requires that the angle of the upper body is never too far forward, nor too far back, both of which jeopardize the lower back and compression injuries on the knees and hip flexor muscles. Proper technique however, can only be achieved if the design of the exercise equipment enables proper technique. The ubiquitous rigid, single-piece handle does not follow the natural movement of a user's hands, wrists, and forearms as the stroke progresses. It does not ensure or enable the bio-mechanically correct alignment of the hands, wrists, and forearms with the direction of the applied force. Typically, the user finishes the stroke with the wrists in an angulated position. It is incorrect to criticize this as \"bad technique\", when the equipment itself is the cause. Through no fault of their own, regular users of indoor rowers equipped with the standard single-piece handle, are prone to repetitive strain injury and chronic wrist pain (see more on this in \"Rowing Technique\" section, below).\n\nIn addition to the high levels of fitness attained, rowing is an intense calorie-burning exercise. The late Dr. Fritz Hagerman, Professor of biomedical science and a leading researcher in rowing physiology, determined that \"...you burn more calories in rowing than any other activity. Cross-country skiing comes closest. At standard submaximal levels of exercise, rowing will burn calories at a rate 10-12% higher than running, and 15-20% higher than cycling.\" <ref>Interview in Concept 2 newsletter, Fall 2001</ref> Although rowers with less ability and training will burn fewer calories, the ergometer is an excellent tool for use in a weight-loss program.\n\nThe standard measurement of speed on an ergometer is generally known as the \"split\", or the amount of time in minutes and seconds required to travel {{convert|500|m}} at the current pace&nbsp;\u2014 a split of 2:00 represents a speed of two minutes per 500 metres, or about {{convert|4.17|m/s|km/h|abbr=on}}. The split does not necessarily correspond to how many strokes the rower takes (the \"rating\") since strokes can vary in power.\n\n==Ergometer testing==\nErgometer tests are used by rowing coaches to evaluate rowers and is part of athlete selection for many senior and junior national rowing teams. During a test, rowers will row a set distance and try to clock the fastest time possible, or a set time and try to row the longest distance possible. The most common distances for erg tests are 1000, 2000, 5000, 6000 or 10000 metres. The most common times for erg tests are 3 min, 5 min, 20 min, 30 min, and 1 hour.\n\n==Rowing technique==\nRowing technique on the erg broadly follows the same pattern as that of a [[Anatomy of a rowing stroke|normal rowing stroke]] on water, but with minor modifications: it is not necessary to \"tap down\" at the finish, since there are no blades to extract from water; but many who also row on water do this anyway. Also, the rigid, single-piece handle enables neither a sweep nor a sculling stroke. The oar handle during a sweep stroke follows a long arc, while the oar handles during a sculling stroke follow two arcs. The standard handle does neither. But regardless of this, to reduce the chance of injury, an exercise machine should enable a bio-mechanically correct movement of the user. The handle is the interface between the human and the machine, and should adapt to the natural movement of the user, not the user to the machine, as is now the case. During competitions an exaggerated finish is often used, whereby the hands are pulled further up the chest than would be possible on the water, resulting in a steep angulation of the wrists - but even with a normal stroke, stop-action images show wrist angulation at the finish, evidence that the standard rigid, single-piece handle does not allow the user to maintain a bio-mechanically correct alignment of hands, wrists, and forearms in the direction of applied force. On the Concept 2 website \"Forum\", many regular users of the indoor rower have complained of chronic wrist pain. Some have rigged handgrips with flexible straps to enable their hands, wrists, and forearms to maintain proper alignment, and thereby reduce the possibility of repetitive strain injury. Rowing machine manufacturers have ignored this problem.\n\nRowing on an ergometer requires four basics phases to complete one stroke; the catch, the drive, the finish and the recovery. The catch is the initial part of the stroke. The drive is where the power from the rower is generated while the finish is the final part of the stroke. Then, the recovery is the initial phase to begin taking a new stroke. The phases repeat until a time duration or a distance is completed.\n\n===Catch===\nKnees are bent with the shins in a vertical position. The back should be roughly parallel to the thigh without hyperflexion (leaning forward too far). The arms and shoulders should be extended forward and relaxed. The arms should be level.\n\n===Drive===\nThe drive is initiated by the extension of the legs; the body remains in the catch posture at this point of the drive. As the legs continue to full extension, the rower engages the [[core (anatomy)|core]] to begin the motion of the body levering backward, adding to the work of the legs. When the legs are flat, the rower begins to pull the handle toward the chest with their arms while keeping their arms straight and parallel to the floor.\n\n===Finish (or release)===\nThe legs are at full extension and flat. The shoulders are slightly behind the pelvis, and the arms are in full contraction with the elbows bent and hands against the chest below the nipples. The back of the rower is still maintained in an upright posture and wrists should be flat.\n\n===Recovery===\nThe recovery is a slow slide back to the initial part of the stroke, it gives the rower time to recover from the previous stroke. During the recovery the actions are in reverse order of the drive. The arms are fully extended so that they are straight. The torso is engaged to move forward back over the pelvis. Weight transfers from the back of the seat to the front of the seat at this time. When the hands come over the knees, the legs contract back towards the foot stretcher. Slowly the back becomes more parallel to the thighs until the recovery becomes the catch.\n\n==Competitions==\n{{refimprove section|date=October 2018}}\nThe first indoor rowing competition \"was held in Cambridge, MA in February 1982 with participation of 96 on-water rowers\" who called themselves the \"Charles River Association of Sculling Has-Beens\" <ref>Concept 2 promotional booklet, year 2000</ref>. Thus the acronym, \"CRASH-B\". A large number of indoor rowing competitions are now held worldwide, including the indoor rowing world championships (still known as [[CRASH-B Sprints]]) held in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States in February and the [[British Indoor Rowing Championships]] held in [[Birmingham]], England in November, or in more recent years the [[Lee Valley VeloPark]] London in December; both are rowed on Concept2s. The core event for most competitions is the individual 2000-m; less common are the mile (e.g., Evesham), the 2500-m (e.g., Basingstoke\u2014also the original distance of the CRASH-B Sprints). Many competitions also include a sprint event (100m-500m) and sometimes team relay events. \n\nMost competitions are organized into categories based on sex, age, and weight class. While the fastest times are generally achieved by rowers between 20 and 40 years old, teenagers and rowers over 90 are common at competitions. There is a nexus between performance on-water and performance on the ergometer, with open events at the World Championships often being dominated by elite on-water rowers. Former men's Olympic single scull champions [[Pertti Karppinen]] and [[Rob Waddell]] and five-time Gold Medalist [[Steve Redgrave|Sir Steven Redgrave]] have all won world championships or set world records in indoor rowing.\n\nIn addition to live venue competitions, many erg racers compete by internet, either offline by posting scores to challenges, or live online races facilitated by computer connection. Online Challenges sponsored by [[Concept2]] include the annual ultra-rowing challenge, the [[Virtual Team Challenge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://log.concept2.com/log_challenges.asp|title = Online Challenges|date = |accessdate = February 6, 2015|website = Concept2|publisher = Concept2|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nRegarding comparability of results between machines: As stated, the above indoor rowing competitions use the Concept 2 rowing ergometer, currently the Model D, which like previous models, is equipped with an electronic performance monitor that compensates for differences in resistance adjustment (1989 US Patent US4875674A; Assignee: Concept 2). Therefore it is widely accepted that a result on one machine can be fairly compared with a result on another machine regardless of their respective resistance settings. The assumed consistency between machines would be correct if another, unmeasured resistance variable did not exist. This is the variability of the resistance of the elastic cord used to take up the chain and return the handle. The electronic performance monitor only measures the energy expended to spin the flywheel. It does this via small magnets embedded in the face of the flywheel which pass a sensor connected to the performance monitor (see patent US4875674A referenced above). The monitor does not measure the energy required to stretch the elastic cord, therefore unless the force required to stretch the elastic cord is a guaranteed constant, there is no guarantee that the performance monitor will display the actual total energy expended by the user.\n\nFactors which affect the force required to stretch the elastic cord are: the tension of the cord, the amount of usage of the machine, ambient temperature. Typically, the elastic cord is factory adjusted to approximately seven pounds of return force. On the Concept 2 website \"Forum\" much anecdotal evidence has been posted of new machines feeling \"heavier\" than used machines, that more effort is required to achieve the same monitored result on a new machine than on one that has been worn-in. This is understandable. Any elastic element loses elastic strength with time and usage.\n\nVariability between machines is of small importance if one machine is used consistently for fitness and training, such as in a home gym. It will still provide a sufficiently reliable measure of one's progress. In a competition setting however, equivalence between machines is essential. An example will clarify: Consider the entirely reasonable possibility that the elastic cord of one machine requires 7 pounds of force to stretch, and the elastic cord of another machine requires 6 1/2 pounds of force to stretch. Now suppose that two competitors, one on each of these machines, complete a 2000M race in 8 minutes at an average stroke rate of 30 strokes per minute. The competitor on the machine with the elastic cord tensioned to 7 pounds will need to pull with 1/2 pound more force for the duration of each stroke than the other competitor in order to obtain the same monitored results (since, as explained, only the energy expended to spin the flywheel is measured, not the energy to stretch the elastic cord). If each stroke averages 5 feet in length, and it takes 240 strokes (8X30) to complete the race, the extra work done by the one competitor is equivalent to lifting a 1/2 pound weight through a vertical distance of 1200 feet (5X240), or put another way, the extra work required by this competitor is equivalent to lifting a 10 pound weight through a vertical distance of 60 feet. However, in this example, despite the difference in energy output by the competitors, the monitor displays are the same.\n\nWhile true that indoor rowing competitions use only new machines in an effort to ensure all elastic cord tensions are identical, this cannot be confirmed because tensions are never measured or adjusted at these competitions. Further, since ambient temperature affects cord elasticity, the results of races in different locations with different ambient temperatures are not comparable. Fairness is particularly problematic with on-line racing in which new machines and worn-in machines with elastic cords of differing strengths and tension can be used by competitors.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Rowbike]]\n*[[Rowing (sport)|Rowing]]\n*[[Rowing tank]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Rowing (sport)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Indoor Rower}}\n[[Category:Indoor rowing| ]]\n[[Category:Exercise equipment]]\n[[Category:Rowing]]", "sha1": "6wgkhvqqz3jhtv3n5yma9ifuls18v33"}}, {"title": "Internetwork Packet Exchange", "ns": "0", "id": "15078", "revision": {"id": "857703217", "parentid": "857703153", "timestamp": "2018-09-02T13:16:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Matthiaspaul", "id": "13467261"}, "comment": "improved links", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|IPX}}\n'''Internetwork Packet Exchange''' ('''IPX''') is the [[network layer]] [[Protocol (computing)|protocol]] in the [[IPX/SPX]] [[protocol stack|protocol suite]].

Field\n|-\n| 2 || Checksum (always 0xFFFF - no checksum)\n|-\n| 2 || Packet Length (including the IPX header)\n|-\n| 1 || Transport Control (hop count)\n|-\n| 1 || Packet Type\n|-\n| 12 || Destination address\n|-\n| 12 || Source address\n|}\n\nThe Packet Type values:\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! Value !! Meaning/Protocol\n|-\n| 0 || Unknown\n|-\n| 1 || RIP ([[Routing Information Protocol]]) (RFC 1582, RFC 2091)\n|-\n| 2 || Echo Packet\n|-\n| 3 || Error Packet\n|-\n| 4 || PEP ([[Packet Exchange Protocol]]), used for SAP ([[Service Advertising Protocol]])\n|-\n| 5 || SPX ([[Sequenced Packet Exchange]])\n|-\n| 17 || NCP ([[NetWare Core Protocol]])\n|}\n\n==IPX addressing==\n\nAn IPX address has the following structure:\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! Octets !! Field\n|-\n| 4 || Network number\n|-\n| 6 || Node number\n|-\n| 2 || Socket number\n|}\n\n===Network number===\n\nThe network number allows to address (and communicate with) the IPX nodes which do not belong to the same network or ''cabling system''. The '''cabling system''' is a network in which a [[data link layer]] protocol can be used for communication. To allow communication between different networks, they must be connected with IPX [[Router (computing)|routers]]. A set of interconnected networks is called an '''internetwork'''. Any [[Novell NetWare]] server may serve as an IPX router. Novell also supplied stand-alone routers. Multiprotocol routers of other vendors often support IPX routing. Using different [[#Frame Formats|frame formats]] in one cabling system is possible, but it works similarly as if separate cabling systems were used (i.e. different network numbers must be used for different frame formats even in the same cabling system and a router must be to allow communication between nodes using different frame formats in the same cabling system).\n\n* Logical networks are assigned a unique 32-bit address in the range 0x1 to 0xFFFFFFFE ([[hexadecimal]]).\n* Hosts have a 48-bit node address which is by default set to the last 4 bytes of the network interface card [[MAC address]].  The node address is appended to the network number to create a unique [[network address]] for the host on the network.\n* Network number 00:00:00:00 means current network\n* Broadcast network number is FF:FF:FF:FF\n\n===Node number===\n\nThe node number is used to address an individual computer (or more exactly, a network interface) in the network. Client stations use its network interface card [[MAC address]] as the node number.\n\nThe value FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF may be used as a node number in a destination address to [[Broadcast address|broadcast]] a packet to \"all nodes in the current network\".\n\n===Socket number===\n\nThe socket number serves to select a process or application in the destination node.\nThe presence of a socket number in the IPX address allows the IPX to act as a [[transport layer]] protocol, comparable with the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) in the [[Internet protocol suite]].\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n!

The difference is that the boundary between network and node part of address in IP is variable, while in IPX it is fixed. As the node address is usually identical to the MAC address of the network adapter, the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] is not needed in IPX.\n\nFor [[routing]], the entries in the IPX [[routing table]] are similar to IP routing tables; routing is done by network address, and for each network address a network:node of the next router is specified in a similar fashion an IP address/netmask is specified in IP routing tables.\n\nThere are 3 routing protocols available for IPX networks: In early IPX networks a version of [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP) was the only available protocol to exchange routing information. Unlike RIP for [[Internet Protocol|IP]], it uses delay time as the main metric, retaining the hop count as a secondary metric. Since NetWare 3, the [[NetWare Link Services Protocol]] (NSLP) based on [[IS-IS]] is available which is more suitable for larger networks. [[Cisco]] routers implement an IPX version of [[Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol|EIGRP]] protocol as well.<ref>{{Cite book | title = Troubleshooting Campus Networks: Practical Analysis of Cisco and LAN Protocols | first1 = Priscilla |last1 = Oppenheimer | first2 = Joseph | last2 = Bardwell |date = August 2002 | isbn = 978-0-471-21013-9 | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | pages = 421\u2013440}}</ref>\n\n==Frame formats==\nIPX can be transmitted over Ethernet using one of the following 4 frame formats or encapsulation types:\n\n* [[Ethernet frame#Novell raw IEEE 802.3|802.3 (raw)]] encapsulation comprises an IEEE 802.3 frame header (destination MAC, source MAC, length) immediately followed by IPX data. It is used in legacy systems, and can be distinguished by the first two bytes of the IPX header always containing a value of 0xFFFF, which cannot be interpreted as valid LLC Destination and Source [[Service Access Point]]s in this location of the frame.\n* [[Ethernet frame#IEEE 802.2 LLC|802.2 (LLC or Novell)]] comprises an IEEE 802.3 frame header (destination MAC, source MAC, length) followed by an [[Logical Link Control|LLC]] header ([[Service Access Point|DSAP]] 0xE0, [[Service Access Point|SSAP]] 0xE0, control 0x03) followed by IPX data. The 0xE0 fields of the LLC header indicate \"NetWare\".\n* [[802.2]] ([[Subnetwork Access Protocol|SNAP]]) comprises an IEEE 802.3 frame header, an LLC header (DSAP 0xAA, SSAP 0xAA, control 0x03), a SNAP header ([[Organizationally Unique Identifier|OUI]] 0x000000, type 0x8137), and IPX data. The 0xAA fields of the LLC header indicate \"SNAP\", and the OUI 0x000000 in the SNAP header indicates an encapsulated [[EtherType]].\n* [[Ethernet frame#Ethernet II|Ethernet II]] encapsulation comprises an Ethernet II frame header (destination MAC, source MAC, [[EtherType]] 0x8137) followed by IPX data.\n\nIn non-Ethernet networks only 802.2 and SNAP frame types are available.\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1132 RFC 1132 - A Standard for the Transmission of 802.2 Packets over IPX Networks]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20150418013816/http://www.ee.siue.edu/~bnoble/comp/networks/frametypes.html Ethernet Frame Types: Don Provan's Definitive Answer]\n\n[[Category:Novell NetWare]]\n[[Category:Network layer protocols]]", "sha1": "stzhlcoyz7d134r8z3yylp3fxi6e8ni"}}, {"title": "International human rights instruments", "ns": "0", "id": "15079", "revision": {"id": "847103752", "parentid": "847103712", "timestamp": "2018-06-22T23:45:21Z", "contributor": {"ip": "2601:188:180:11F0:65F5:930C:B0B2:CD63"}, "comment": "Undid revision 847103712 by [[Special:Contributions/24.67.164.137|24.67.164.137]] ([[User talk:24.67.164.137|talk]])", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}\n\n'''International human rights instruments''' are [[treaties]] and other international documents relevant to [[international human rights law]] and the protection of [[human rights]] in general.<ref>[http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CoreInstruments.aspx OHCHR The Core International Human Rights Instruments and their monitoring bodies]</ref> They can be classified into two categories: ''declarations'', adopted by bodies such as the [[United Nations General Assembly]], which are not legally binding although they may be politically so as [[soft law]];<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Druzin|first=Bryan|year=2016|title=Why does Soft Law have any Power anyway?|url=https://works.bepress.com/bryan_druzin/22/download/|journal=Asian Journal of International Law.|volume=|page=1}}</ref> and ''conventions'', which are legally binding instruments concluded under [[international law]]. International treaties and even declarations can, over time, obtain the status of [[customary international law]].\n\nInternational [[human rights]] instruments can be divided further into ''global instruments'', to which any state in the world can be a party, and ''regional instruments'', which are restricted to states in a particular region of the world.\n\nMost conventions establish mechanisms to oversee their implementation. In some cases these mechanisms have relatively little power, and are often ignored by member states; in other cases these mechanisms have great political and legal authority, and their decisions are almost always implemented. Examples of the first case include the UN treaty committees, while the best exemplar of the second case is the [[European Court of Human Rights]].\n\nMechanisms also vary as to the degree of individual access to them. Under some conventions &ndash; e.g. the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] &ndash; individuals or states are permitted, subject to certain conditions, to take individual cases to the enforcement mechanisms; under most, however (e.g. the UN conventions), individual access is contingent on the acceptance of that right by the relevant state party, either by a declaration at the time of ratification or accession, or through ratification of or accession to an optional [[Treaty#Protocols|protocol]] to the convention. This is part of the evolution of international law over the last several decades. It has moved from a body of laws governing states to recognizing the importance of individuals and their rights within the international legal framework.\n\nThe [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]], and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] are sometimes referred to as the ''international bill of rights''.\n\n== Declarations ==\n=== Global ===\n*[[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]] 1923\n*[[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] ([[United Nations|UN]], 1948)\n*[[Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons]] ([[United Nations|UN]], 1975)\n*[[Declaration on the Right to Development]] ([[United Nations|UN]], 1986)\n*[[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] ([[World Conference on Human Rights]], 1993)\n*[[Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities]] ([[UNESCO]], 1998)\n*[[Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity]] ([[UNESCO]], 2001)\n*[[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]] ([[United Nations|UN]], 2007)\n*[[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]] ([[United Nations|UN]], 2008)\n\n=== Regional: Americas ===\n* [[American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man]] ([[Organization of American States|OAS]], 1948)\n\n=== Regional: Asia ===\n* [[ASEAN Human Rights Declaration]] ([[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]], 2009)\n\n=== Regional: Middle East ===\n* [[Cairo Declaration of Human Rights in Islam]] ([[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|OIC]],1990)\n\n==Conventions==\n\n=== Global ===\nAccording to OHCHR, there are 9 ''core'' international human rights instruments and several optional protocols.

It was founded as the '''Ecology Party of Ireland''' in 1981 by [[Dublin]] teacher [[Christopher Fettes]]. The party became the '''Green Alliance''' in 1983; it adopted its current English name in 1987, while the Irish name was kept unchanged. Its leader is [[Eamon Ryan]], its deputy leader is [[Catherine Martin (politician)|Catherine Martin]] and its chairman is [[Roderic O'Gorman]]. Green Party candidates have been elected to most levels of representation: [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local]] (in the Republic), [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[European Parliament]].\n\nThe Green Party first entered the D\u00e1il in 1989. It has served in the [[Government of Ireland|Irish government]] once, from 2007 to 2011 as junior partner in a coalition with [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. The party suffered a wipeout in the [[Irish general election, 2011|February 2011 election]], losing all six of its TDs. In the [[Irish general election, 2016|February 2016 election]], it returned to the D\u00e1il with two seats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/eamon-ryan-elected-green-party-2630819-Feb2016/|title=Green Party back as Eamon Ryan joins his deputy in D\u00e1il|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=28 February 2016|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> Following this, [[Grace O'Sullivan]] was elected to the [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Seanad]] on 26 April that year.\n\nThe party gained its first representation in the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2007, the [[Green Party in Northern Ireland]] having become a regional branch of the party the previous year. It currently has two representatives in the Assembly.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nThe party's first electoral outing was at the [[Irish general election, November 1982|November 1982 general election]] when seven candidates contested under the ''Ecology Party'' banner, winning 0.2% of the vote. Following a name change, it contested the [[European Parliament election, 1984 (Ireland)|1984 European elections]], with party founder [[Roger Garland]] winning 1.9% in the Dublin constituency. The following year, it won its first election when Marcus Counihan was elected to [[Killarney|Killarney Urban District Council]] at the [[Irish local elections, 1985|1985 local elections]]. The party nationally ran 34 candidates and won 0.6% of the vote.\n\nThe party continued to struggle until the [[Irish general election, 1989|1989 general election]] when the Green Party (as it was now named) won its first [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann|D\u00e1il]] seat, when Roger Garland was elected in [[Dublin South (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin South]]. Garland lost his seat at the [[Irish general election, 1992|1992 general election]], while [[Trevor Sargent]] gained a seat in [[Dublin North (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North]]. In the [[European Parliament election, 1994 (Ireland)|1994 European election]], [[Patricia McKenna]] topped the poll in the Dublin constituency and [[Nuala Ahern]] won a seat in Leinster. They retained their [[European Parliament]] seats in the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (Ireland)|1999 European election]], although the party lost five councillors in local elections held that year despite an increase in its vote. At the [[Irish general election, 1997|1997 general election]], the party gained a seat when [[John Gormley]] won a D\u00e1il seat in [[Dublin South-East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin South-East]].\n\nAt the [[Irish general election, 2002|2002 general election]] the party made a breakthrough, getting six [[Teachta D\u00e1la|Teachta\u00ed D\u00e1la]] (TDs) elected to the D\u00e1il with 4% of the national vote. However, in the [[European Parliament election, 2004 (Ireland)|2004 European election]], the party lost both of its European Parliament seats. In the [[Irish local elections, 2004|2004 local elections]], it increased its number of councillors at county level from 8 to 18 (out of 883) and at town council level from 5 to 14 (out of 744).\n\n===Term in government===\n{{main article|Government of the 30th D\u00e1il}}\nThe Green Party entered government for the first time after the [[Irish general election, 2007|2007 general election]], held on 24 May. Although its share of first preference votes increased at the election, the party failed to increase the number of TDs returned. [[Mary White (Green Party politician)|Mary White]] won a seat for the first time in [[Carlow\u2013Kilkenny (D\u00e1il constituency)|Carlow\u2013Kilkenny]]; however, [[Dan Boyle (politician)|Dan Boyle]] lost his seat in [[Cork South-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork South-Central]].\n\nThe party had approached the 2007 general election on an independent platform, ruling out no coalition partners while expressing its preference for an alternative to the outgoing coalition of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] and the [[Progressive Democrats]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0225/weekinpolitics.html |title=Poll shows loss of support for FF |date=25 February 2007 |author=[[RT\u00c9]] |accessdate=17 January 2009 |work=RT\u00c9 News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303165613/http://www.rte.ie/news/2007/0225/weekinpolitics.html |archivedate=3 March 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johngormley.com/wp/2007/02/24/speech-to-green-party-convention-2007/ |title=Speech to Green Party Convention 2007 |date=24 February 2007 |author=[[John Gormley]] |work=John Gormley's blog |accessdate=14 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010130807/http://www.johngormley.com/wp/2007/02/24/speech-to-green-party-convention-2007/ |archivedate=10 October 2007 }}</ref> Neither the outgoing government nor an alternative of [[Fine Gael]], [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] and the Green Party had sufficient seats to form a majority.

People who engage in or support iconoclasm are called ''iconoclasts'', a term that has come to be applied figuratively to any individual who challenges \"cherished beliefs or venerated institutions on the grounds that they are erroneous or pernicious\".<ref>[[OED]], \"Iconoclast, 2\", see also \"Iconoclasm\" and \"Iconoclastic\".</ref> \n\nConversely, one who reveres or venerates religious images is called (by iconoclasts) an ''iconolater''; in a [[Byzantine]] context, such a person is called an ''[[iconodule]]'' or ''iconophile''.\n\nThe term does not generally encompass the specific destruction of images of a ruler after his death or overthrow (''[[damnatio memoriae]]'').\n\nIconoclasm may be carried out by people of a different religion, but is often the result of sectarian disputes between factions of the same religion. Within Christianity, iconoclasm has generally been motivated by those who adopt a literal interpretation of the [[Ten Commandments]], which forbid the making and worshipping of \"graven images or any likeness of anything\".<ref>\"You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them&nbsp;...\" (Exodus 20:4\u20135a, ESV.)</ref> The later [[Church Fathers]] identified [[Jews]], fundamental iconoclasts, with [[heresy]] and saw deviations from orthodox Christianity and opposition to the veneration of images as heresies that were essentially \"Jewish in spirit\".<ref name=RobertM1>{{cite book|last1=Michael|first1=Robert|title=A history of Catholic antisemitism : the dark side of the church|date=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-11131-8|pages=28\u201330|edition=1st Palgrave Macmillan pbk.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZnFAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=anti-semitism+jews+jewish+heretics+heresy&source=bl&ots=Wc7_FQaTAj&sig=CzUEubnkVNbs8SedIKEa3US63yg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=l7_YVMjmKYX5yQO_m4LIBw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=heretic&f=false|accessdate=9 February 2015}}</ref> The degree of iconoclasm among Christian branches greatly varies.

He sent royal officials to chisel out and destroy every reference to Amun and the names of other deities on tombs, temple walls, and cartouches to instill in the people that the [[Aten]] was the one true god.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Akhenaten.aspx |title=Akhenaten |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |accessdate=2015-12-31}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nPublic references to Akhenaten were destroyed soon after his death.\n\nComparing the [[ancient Egypt]]ians with the [[Israelites]], Jan Assmann writes:\n\n<blockquote>For Egypt, the greatest horror was the destruction or abduction of the cult images.  In the eyes of the [[Israelites]], the erection of images meant the destruction of [[divine presence]]; in the eyes of the Egyptians, this same effect was attained by the destruction of images.  In Egypt, iconoclasm was the most terrible religious crime; in Israel, the most terrible religious crime was [[idolatry]].  In this respect Osarseph alias Akhenaten, the iconoclast, and the [[Golden Calf]], the paragon of idolatry, correspond to each other inversely, and it is strange that [[Aaron]] could so easily avoid the role of the religious criminal.  It is more than probable that these traditions evolved under mutual influence.  In this respect, [[Moses]] and Akhenaten became, after all, closely related.<ref>Jan Assmann, ''From Akhenaten to Moses: Ancient Egypt and Religious Change'', pg. 76, 2014, [[The American University in Cairo Press]], {{ISBN|977-416-631-0}}.</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Byzantine era===\n{{Main|Byzantine Iconoclasm}}\n[[File:Clasm Chludov detail 9th century.jpg|thumb|[[Byzantine Iconoclasm]], [[Chludov Psalter]], 9th century<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320Hist&Civ/slides/14islam/iconoclasm.JPG |title=Byzantine iconoclasm |accessdate=2013-04-30}}</ref>]]\n\nAlthough [[Christian art|widespread use of Christian iconography]] only began as Christianity increasingly spread among gentiles after the legalization of Christianity by [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] (c. 312 AD), scattered expressions of opposition to the use of images were reported (e.g. Spanish [[Synod of Elvira]]). The period after the reign of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian]] (527\u2013565) evidently saw a huge increase in the use of images, both in volume and quality, and a gathering aniconic reaction.\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire]], government-led iconoclasm began with [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo&nbsp;III]], following what seems to have been a long period of rising [[Aniconism in Christianity|opposition to the use or misuse of images]].  The religious conflict created political and economic divisions in Byzantine society.  It was generally supported by the Eastern, poorer, non-Greek peoples of the Empire<ref>Cyril Mango, ''The Oxford History of Byzantium,'' 2002.</ref> who had to deal frequently with raids from the new Muslim Empire.  On the other hand, the wealthier Greeks of [[Constantinople]], and also the peoples of the Balkan and Italian provinces, strongly opposed iconoclasm.<ref>Mango, 2002.</ref>\n\nWithin the Byzantine Empire the government had probably been adopting Christian images more frequently. One notable change came in 695, when [[Justinian II]]'s government added a full-face image of Christ on the [[obverse]] of imperial gold coins. The change caused the [[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] to stop his earlier adoption of Byzantine coin types. He started a purely Islamic coinage with lettering only.<ref name=\"RC\">Robin Cormack, ''Writing in Gold, Byzantine Society and its Icons'', 1985, George Philip, London, {{ISBN|0-540-01085-5}}.</ref>  A letter by the Patriarch Germanus written before 726 to two Iconoclast bishops says that \"now whole towns and multitudes of people are in considerable agitation over this matter\" but there is little written evidence of the debate.<ref>C Mango, \"Historical Introduction\", in Bryer & Herrin, eds., ''Iconoclasm'', pp. 2\u20133., 1977, Centre for Byzantine Studies, [[University of Birmingham]], {{ISBN|0-7044-0226-2}}.</ref>\n<!-- this should come out since there is a main article on the subject - it just needs to be introduced here\n===The first iconoclastic period: 730\u2013787===\nSometime between 726 and 730, the Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] began the iconoclast campaign.<ref>Cf.

She decided that an ecumenical council needed to be held to address the issue of iconoclasm and directed this request to [[Pope Adrian I]] (772\u2013795) in Rome.  He announced his agreement and called the convention on 1 August 786 in the presence of the Emperor and Empress.  The initial proceedings were interrupted by the violent entry of iconoclast soldiers faithful to the memory of the prior Emperor Constantine&nbsp;V.  This caused the council to be adjourned until a reliable army could be assembled to protect any proceedings. The council was reassembled at [[Nicaea]] 24 September 787.  During those proceedings the following was adopted:\n\n{{quote|... we declare that we defend free from any innovations all the written and unwritten ecclesiastical traditions that have been entrusted to us. One of these is the production of representational art; this is quite in harmony with the history of the spread of the gospel, as it provides confirmation that the becoming man of the Word of God was real and not just imaginary, and as it brings us a similar benefit.  For, things that mutually illustrate one another undoubtedly possess one another's message.\n\n ... we decree with full precision and care that, like the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, the revered and holy images, whether painted or made of mosaic or of other suitable material, are to be exposed in the holy churches of God, on sacred instruments and vestments, on walls and panels, in houses and by public ways; these are the images of our Lord, God and saviour, Jesus Christ, and of our Lady without blemish, the holy God-bearer, and of the revered angels and of any of the saintly holy men.  The more frequently they are seen in representational art, the more are those who see them drawn to remember and long for those who serve as models, and to pay these images the tribute of salutation and respectful veneration. Certainly this is not the full adoration in accordance with our faith, which is properly paid only to the divine nature, but it resembles that given to the figure of the honoured and life-giving cross, and also to the holy books of the gospels and to other sacred cult objects.<ref name=\"Tanner, Norman P. p. 132\u2013136\">Tanner, Norman P., Alberigo, G., Dossetti, J.

To understand iconoclastic arguments, one must note the main points:\n# Iconoclasm condemned the making of any lifeless image (e.g.,&nbsp;painting or statue) that was intended to represent Jesus or one of the saints. The \"Epitome of the Definition of the Iconoclastic Conciliabulum\" ([[Synod of Hiereia]]) held in 754 declared:<ref name=\"hieria1\"/> \n\n{{quote|Supported by [[the Holy Scriptures]] and the Fathers, we declare unanimously, in the name of the Holy Trinity, that there shall be rejected and removed and cursed one of the [[Christian Church]] every likeness which is made out of any material and colour whatever by the evil art of painters&nbsp;... If anyone ventures to represent the divine image (\u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1, ''charakt\u0113r'') of the Word after the Incarnation with material colours, let him be anathema!&nbsp;... If anyone shall endeavour to represent the forms of the Saints in lifeless pictures with material colours which are of no value (for this notion is vain and introduced by the devil), and does not rather represent their virtues as living images in himself, let him be anathema!}}\n\n#  For iconoclasts, the only real religious image must be an exact likeness of the prototype\u2014of the same substance\u2014which they considered impossible, seeing wood and paint as empty of spirit and life.  Thus for iconoclasts the only true (and permitted) \"icon\" of Jesus was the [[Eucharist]], which was believed to be his body and blood.\n#  Any true image of Jesus must be able to represent both his divine nature (which is impossible because it cannot be seen nor encompassed) as well his human nature.  But by making an icon of Jesus, one is separating his human and divine natures, since only the human can be depicted (separating the natures was considered [[nestorianism]]), or else confusing the human and divine natures, considering them one (union of the human and divine natures was considered [[monophysitism]]).\n#  Icon use for religious purposes was viewed as an innovation in the Church, a Satanic misleading of Christians to return to pagan practice. \n\n<blockquote>Satan misled men, so that they worshipped the creature instead of the Creator. The Law of Moses and the Prophets cooperated to remove this ruin.&nbsp;... But the previously mentioned demiurge of evil&nbsp;... gradually brought back idolatry under the appearance of Christianity.<ref name=\"hieria1\">{{citation |title=Epitome of the Iconoclast Council at Hieria, 754 AD |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/icono-cncl754.html |publisher=[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html Internet Medieval Sourcebook] |postscript=,}} also available from [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xvi.x.html Christian Classics Ethereal Library]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt was also seen as a departure from ancient church tradition, of which there was a written record opposing religious images.\n[[File:Triumph of Orthodoxy.jpg|thumb|288px|Triumph of Orthodoxy]]\nThe chief theological opponents of iconoclasm were the monks Mansur ([[John of Damascus]]), who, living in Muslim territory as advisor to the Caliph of Damascus, was far enough away from the Byzantine emperor to evade retribution, and [[Theodore the Studite]], abbot of the [[Stoudios]] monastery in Constantinople.  John declared that he did not venerate matter, \"but rather the creator of matter\".  However he also declared, \"But I also venerate the matter through which salvation came to me, as if filled with divine energy and grace\". He includes in this latter category the ink in which the gospels were written as well as the paint of images, the wood of the Cross, and the Body and Blood of Jesus.\n\nThe iconodule response to iconoclasm included:\n#  Assertion that the biblical commandment forbidding images of God had been superseded by the incarnation of Jesus, who, being the Second Person of the Trinity, is God incarnate in visible matter. Therefore, they were not depicting the invisible God, but God as He appeared in the flesh. This became an attempt to shift the issue of the incarnation in their favor, whereas the iconoclasts had used the issue of the incarnation against them.\n#  Further, in their view idols depicted persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was \"all religious images not of our faith are idols; all images of our faith are icons to be venerated\". This was considered comparable to [[Old Testament|the Old Testament]] practice of offering burnt sacrifices only to God, and not to any other gods.\n#  Moses had been instructed by God according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|25:18\u201322|NKJV}} to make golden statues of [[cherubim]] angels on the lid of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], and according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:31|NKJV}} God instructed Moses to embroider the curtain which separated the [[Holy of Holies]] in the [[Tabernacle]] with cherubim. Moses had also been told by God to embroider the tent walls of the Tabernacle with cherubim angels according to {{bibleverse||Exodus|26:1|NKJV}} and {{bibleverse||Exodus|36:8|NKJV}}.\n#  Regarding the written tradition opposing the making and veneration of images, they asserted that icons were part of unrecorded oral tradition (''par\u00e1dosis'', sanctioned in Christianity as authoritative in doctrine by reference to {{bibleverse|2|Thessalonians|2:15|NKJV}}, [[Basil the Great]], etc.).\n#  Arguments were drawn from the miraculous [[Acheiropoieta]], the supposed icon of the Virgin painted with her approval by St.&nbsp;Luke, and other miraculous occurrences around icons, that demonstrated divine approval of Iconodule practices.\n#  Iconodules further argued that decisions such as whether icons ought to be venerated were properly made by the church assembled in council, not imposed on the church by an emperor. Thus the argument also involved the issue of the proper relationship between church and state. Related to this was the observation that it was foolish to deny to God the same honor that was freely given to the human emperor.\n -->\n\n===Reformation era===\n{{further|Beeldenstorm}}\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Calvinist Iconoclasm during the Reformation\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:2008-09 Nijmegen st stevens beeldenstorm.JPG|16th-century iconoclasm in the [[Protestant Reformation]].

It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. Joseph Leo Koerner has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. \"An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments\" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: \"You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return\" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.}}</ref><ref name=\"Felix2015\"/> the [[Reformed]] (Calvinist) leaders, in particular [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]], encouraged the removal of religious images by invoking the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue's]] prohibition of idolatry and the manufacture of graven (sculpted) images of God.<ref name=\"Felix2015\">{{cite book|last=Felix|first=Steven|title=Pentecostal Aesthetics: Theological Reflections in a Pentecostal Philosophy of Art and Aesthetics.|date=30 January 2015|publisher=[[Brill Academic Publishers]]|language=English|isbn=9789004291621|page=22|quote=Luther's view was that biblical images could be used as teaching aids,and thus had didactic value.

This may also be known as ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', the ancient Roman practice of official obliteration of the memory of a specific individual. Stricter definitions of \"iconoclasm\" exclude both types of action, reserving the term for religious or more widely cultural destruction. In many cases, such as [[Revolutionary Russia]] or [[Ancient Egypt]], this distinction can be hard to make.\n\nAmong Roman emperors and other political figures subject to decrees of ''damnatio memoriae'' were [[Sejanus]], [[Publius Septimius Geta]], and [[Domitian]]. Several Emperors, such as [[Domitian]] and [[Commodus]] had during their reigns erected numerous statues of themselves, which were pulled down and destroyed when they were overthrown.\n\n===Iconoclasm in the French Revolution===\n<!-- this should be broken out into a separate article -->\nThroughout the radical phase of the [[French Revolution]], iconoclasm was supported by members of the government as well as the citizenry.  Numerous monuments, religious works, and other historically significant pieces were destroyed in an attempt to eradicate any memory of the [[Old Regime]].  At the same time, the republican government felt responsible to preserve these works for their historical, aesthetic, and cultural value.  One way the republican government succeeded in their paradoxical mission of preserving and destroying symbols of the Old Regime was through the development of museums.\n\nDuring the Revolution, a statue of [[King Louis XV]] in the Paris square which until then bore his name, was pulled down and destroyed. This was a prelude to the [[guillotine|guillotining]] of his successor [[Louis XVI]] in the same site, renamed \"Place de la R\u00e9volution\" (at present [[Place de la Concorde]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Idzerda|first=Stanley J.|year=1954|title=\"Iconoclasm during the French Revolution\"|url=|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=60/1|pages=13\u201326|via=|doi=10.2307/1842743}}</ref>\n\nThe statue of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] on the column at [[Place Vend\u00f4me]], Paris was also the target of iconoclasm several times: destroyed after the [[Bourbon Restoration]], restored by [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis-Philippe]], destroyed during the [[Paris Commune]] and restored by [[Adolphe Thiers]].\n<!-- \n===Roland and the Monuments Commission===\nThe Monuments Commission had a responsibility of preserving art despite its problematic political symbolism. Jean Roland was installed as the Minister of Interior in 1792 and was faced with pressure from the National Convention to destroy symbols of the Old Regime. Roland, given the responsibility of simultaneously preserving and destroying art, found his solution in the form of public museums. The museum served as a representation of France's rich artistic heritage. Roland had an idealistic vision for the opening of the Louvre as a means of showcasing the glory and power of the Revolution.<ref>Bette W. Oliver.

Its collection was almost entirely composed of art from the monarchy's collection in Versailles. Although the radical government's official purpose of installing this art was to \"avoid favoritism among artists,\" the paintings were \"secretly held in high regard.\"<ref>Emmet, Kennedy. A Cultural History of the French Revolution. (New Haven: Yale UP, 1989): pp. 221, 223</ref> Many critics believed that the art from the royalist era was superior to the work of contemporary artists and therefore believed that the works served a greater historical and aesthetic purpose.<ref>Emmet 1989, p. 225</ref> These artistic symbols of \"royalty, feudalism, and superstition\" lost their significance in the passive and detached environment of the Louvre.<ref>Stanley J. Idzerda, \"Iconoclasm during the French Revolution.\" In The American Historical Review, Vol. 60, No. 1 (Oct., 1954), p. 25.</ref> The Louvre, along with other French museums, was a compromise between the political push to preserve and destroy art. Consequently, the museum represented one form of iconoclasm, as it destroyed the essence and meaning of artistic images while preserving its physical form. French museums stripped art of its culturally specific meaning, separating the great artworks from their potentially counterrevolutionary context. Subsequently, politically controversial works were allowed to be preserved.<ref>Foucault, Michel. \"Of Other Spaces.\" Diacritics. (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986): 4.</ref> Thus, the museum freed images from their intended symbolic meaning and allowed French citizens to appreciate the art merely for its aesthetic and technical characteristics.<ref>Deleuze, Gilles, and Felix Guattari.

It eventually became one of the most popular museums in Europe. Its curator, Alexandre Lenoir, preserved religious sculptures and tombs for his museum. He was able to preserve relics of the feudal system by convincing revolutionary leaders of their stylistic merit, and minimizing reverence toward the societies the works portrayed.<ref>Greene, Christopher M., \"Alexandre Lenoir and the Mus\u00e9e des monuments fran\u00e7ais during the French Revolution,\" French Historical Studies 12, no. 2 (1981): p. 200\u2013222.</ref> \"Revolutionary museums did not so much eliminate meanings as provide new ones.\" <ref>Greene 1981, p. 207.</ref>\n-->\n\n===Destruction of Hindu temples===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| align    = left\n| title = Iconoclasm during the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent]]\n| image1 = Somnath temple ruins (1869).jpg|caption1=The [[Somnath Temple]] in Gujarat was repeatedly destroyed by Islamic armies and rebuilt by Hindus.

A notable incident was the destruction of the [[Ramna Kali Mandir]] in former [[East Pakistan]]. The temple was bulldozed by the Pakistani Army on March 27, 1971. The [[Dhakeshwari Temple]] was severely damaged during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], and over half of the temple's buildings were destroyed. In a major disrespect of the religion, the main worship hall was taken over by the [[Pakistan]] Army and used as an ammunitions storage area. Several of the temple custodians were tortured and killed by the Army though most, including the Head Priest, fled first to their ancestral villages and then to India and therefore escaped death.\n\nIn 2006 the last Hindu temple in [[Lahore]] was destroyed to pave the way for construction of a multi-story commercial building. The temple was demolished after officials of the Evacuee Property Trust Board concealed facts from the board chairman about the nature of the building.

Between 2001 and April 2005, one hundred cases of temple attacks have been registered with the police. The alarming increase of temple destruction has spread fear and intimidation among the Hindu minorities and has hastened immigration to neighboring Australia and New Zealand.

The Cultural Revolution included widespread destruction of historic artworks in public places and private collections, whether religious or secular. Objects in state museums were mostly left intact.\n\n===Iconoclasm in Eastern Europe===\n[[File:Christ saviour explosion.jpg|thumb|Demolition of the [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Moscow]], 5 December 1931]]\nDuring and after the [[October Revolution]], widespread destruction of religious and secular imagery took place, as well as the destruction of imagery related to [[House of Romanov|the Imperial family]]. The Revolution was accompanied by destruction of monuments of past [[tsar]]s, as well as the destruction of [[Coat of arms of Russia|imperial eagles]] at various locations throughout [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. According to Christopher Wharton, \"In front of a Moscow cathedral, crowds cheered as the enormous statue of Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] was bound with ropes and gradually beaten to the ground.

Brigid was said to visit one's home at Imbolc. To receive her blessings, people would make a bed for Brigid and leave her food and drink, while items of clothing would be left outside for her to bless. Brigid was also invoked to protect homes and livestock. Special feasts were had, [[holy well]]s were visited and it was also a time for [[divination]].\n\nAlthough many of its customs died out in the 20th century, it is still observed and in some places it has been revived as a cultural event.

It was one of four Gaelic seasonal festivals: [[Samhain]] (~1 November), Imbolc (~1 February), [[Beltane]] (~1 May) and [[Lughnasadh]] (~1 August).\n\nFrom the 18th century to the mid 20th century, many accounts of Imbolc or St Brigid's Day were recorded by [[folkloristics|folklorists]] and other writers.

Visitors to holy wells would pray for health while walking '[[sunwise]]' around the well. They would then leave offerings; typically coins or [[clootie]]s (see [[clootie well]]).

This typically included food such as [[colcannon]], [[sowans]], [[dumpling]]s, [[barmbrack]] and/or [[bannock (food)|bannocks]].<ref name=\"danaher15\"/> Often, some of the food and drink would be set aside for Brigid.<ref name=\"stations\"/>\n\nBrigid would be symbolically invited into the house and a bed would often be made for her. In the north of Ireland a family member, representing Brigid, would circle the home three times carrying rushes. They would then knock the door three times, asking to be let in. On the third attempt they are welcomed in, the meal is had, and the rushes are then made into a bed or crosses.<ref>Danaher, ''The Year in Ireland'', pp. 20\u201321, 97\u201398</ref> In 18th century Mann, the custom was to stand at the door with a bundle of rushes and say \"Brede, Brede, come to my house tonight. Open the door for Brede and let Brede come in\". The rushes were then strewn on the floor as a carpet or bed for Brigid. In the 19th century, some old Manx women would make a bed for Brigid in the barn with food, ale, and a candle on a table.<ref name=\"stations\"/> In the Hebrides in the late 18th century, a bed of hay would be made for Brigid and someone would then call out three times: \"''{{lang|gd|a Bhr\u00edd, a Bhr\u00edd, thig a stigh as gabh do leabaidh}}''\" (\"{{lang|gd|Br\u00edd Br\u00edd}}, come in; thy bed is ready\").<ref name=stations/> A white wand, usually made of birch, would be set by the bed. It represented the wand that Brigid was said to use to make the vegetation start growing again.<ref>Carmichael, ''Carmina Gadelica'', p. 582</ref> In the 19th century, women in the Hebrides would dance while holding a large cloth and calling out \"''{{lang|gd|Bridean, Bridean, thig an nall 's dean do leabaidh}}''\" (\"{{lang|gd|Br\u00edd Br\u00edd}}, come over and make your bed\"). However, by this time the bed itself was rarely made.<ref name=stations/>\n\nBefore going to bed, people would leave items of clothing or strips of cloth outside for Brigid to bless.<ref name=\"stations\"/> Ashes from the fire would be raked smooth and, in the morning, they would look for some kind of mark on the ashes as a sign that Brigid had visited.<ref name=\"stations\"/><ref name=\"monaghan256\">Monaghan, Patricia.

Sometimes the representative was a girl, but usually it was a doll-like figure known as a ''{{lang|ga|Br\u00edde\u00f3g}}'' (also called a 'Breedhoge' or 'Biddy'). It would be made from [[Juncus|rushes]] or [[reed (plant)|reeds]] and clad in bits of cloth, shells and/or flowers.<ref name=\"stations\"/><ref name=\"monaghan256\"/> In the Hebrides of Scotland, a bright shell or crystal called the ''{{lang|gd|reul-iuil Br\u00edde}}'' (guiding star of Brigid) was set on its chest. The girls would carry it in procession while singing a hymn to Brigid. All wore white with their hair unbound as a symbol of purity and youth. They visited every house in the area, where they received either food or more decoration for the {{lang|gd|Br\u00edde\u00f3g}}. Afterwards, they feasted in a house with the {{lang|gd|Br\u00edde\u00f3g}} set in a place of honour, and put it to bed with lullabies. When the meal was done, the local young men humbly asked for admission, made obeisance to the {{lang|gd|Br\u00edde\u00f3g}}, and joined the girls in dancing and merrymaking.<ref name=\"stations\"/> In many parts, only unwed girls could carry the {{lang|gd|Br\u00edde\u00f3g}}, but in some places both boys and girls carried it.<ref>Monaghan, p. 58.</ref> In the late 17th century, Catholic families in the Hebrides would make a bed for the {{lang|gd|Br\u00edde\u00f3g}} out of a basket.<ref name=\"stations\"/> Up until the mid-20th century, children in Ireland still went house-to-house asking for pennies for \"poor Biddy\", or money for the poor. In [[County Kerry]], men in white robes went from house to house singing.<ref>Monaghan, p. 44.</ref>\n\nIn Ireland, [[Brigid's cross]]es (''pictured on the right'') were made at Imbolc. A Brigid's cross usually consists of rushes woven into a square or equilateral cross, although three-armed crosses have also been recorded.<ref>{{cite book|last1=\u00d3 Duinn,|first1=Se\u00e1n|title=The Rites of Brigid: Goddess and Saint|date=2005|publisher=Columba Press|location=Dublin|isbn=978-1856074834|page=121}}</ref><ref>[[Emyr Estyn Evans|Evans, Emyr Estyn]].

Young boys would carry it around the village, inviting people to step through it and so be blessed.<ref name=stations/>\n\nToday, some people still make Brigid's crosses and {{lang|ga|Br\u00edde\u00f3g}}s or visit holy wells dedicated to St Brigid on 1 February.<ref>Monaghan, p. 60.</ref>\n\n=== Biddy's Day Festival, Killorglin ===\n\nThe Biddy is an ancient tradition associated with Mid Kerry, Ireland. A Biddy group consists of masked men and women dressed in white and wearing elaborate straw hats. Biddy groups visit rural and public houses. They carry a Br\u00edde\u00f3g (effigy/doll of brigid as a child) with them to ensure evil spirits are kept away from humans and animals alike for the coming year. In each establishment, they will play music and put on displays of dancing and singing. The Biddy\u2019s heritage is a mixture of Christianity (St Bridgid) and ancient Celtic traditions (Imbolc).\n\nTraditionally, a visit from the Biddy guaranteed good luck, fertility, prosperity and to not receive a visit was considered a terrible sleight. A unique festival to celebrate the Biddy tradition is held annually in [[Killorglin]].

The traditional view is that all 66 chapters of the book of Isaiah were written by one man, Isaiah, possibly in two periods between 740 BCE and c. 686 BCE, separated by approximately 15 years, and includes dramatic prophetic declarations of [[Cyrus the Great in the Bible]], acting to restore the nation of Israel from [[Babylonian captivity]]. Another widely-held view is that parts of the first half of the book (chapters 1\u201339) originated with the historical prophet, interspersed with prose commentaries written in the time of King [[Josiah]] a hundred years later, and that the remainder of the book dates from immediately before and immediately after the end of the [[Babylonian captivity|exile in Babylon]], almost two centuries after the time of the historic prophet.{{efn|See the article \"[[Book of Isaiah]]\" for an extended overview of theories of its composition.}}\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Isaiah.jpg|thumb|left|[[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] [[icon]] of the Prophet Isaiah, 18th century ([[iconostasis]] of [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]] Church, [[Kizhi]] monastery, [[Karelia]], [[Russia]]).]]\n[[File:Antonio Balestra - Prophet Isaiah.jpg|thumb|Painting of Isaiah by [[Antonio Balestra]]]]\nThe first verse of the Book of Isaiah states that Isaiah prophesied during the reigns of [[Uzziah]] (or Azariah), [[Jotham of Judah|Jotham]], [[Ahaz]], and [[Hezekiah]], the kings of [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|1:1|HE}}). Uzziah's reign was 52 years in the middle of the 8th century BCE, and Isaiah must have begun his ministry a few years before Uzziah's death, probably in the [[740s BCE]]. Isaiah lived until the fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign (who died [[690s BCE|698 BCE]]). He may have been contemporary for some years with [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]]. Thus Isaiah may have prophesied for as long as 64 years.<ref name=\"Easton1897\">{{eastons|Isaiah|inline=yes}}</ref>\n\nAccording to some modern interpretations, Isaiah's wife was called \"the prophetess\" ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|8:3|HE}}), either because she was endowed with the prophetic gift, like [[Deborah]] ({{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|HE}}) and [[Huldah]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14\u201320|HE}}), or simply because she was the \"wife of the prophet\".<ref name=\"Easton1897\"/><ref>Coogan, Michael D.

A stained glass window at [[St. Matthew's German Evangelical Lutheran Church]] in Charleston, South Carolina]]\nSoon after this, [[Shalmaneser V]] determined to subdue the kingdom of Israel, taking over and destroying [[Samaria]] ([[720s BCE|722 BCE]]). So long as Ahaz reigned, the kingdom of Judah was untouched by the Assyrian power. But when Hezekiah gained the throne, he was encouraged to rebel \"against the king of Assyria\" ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:7|HE}}), and entered into an alliance with the king of [[Egypt]] ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|30:2\u20134|HE}}). The king of Assyria threatened the king of Judah, and at length invaded the land. [[Sennacherib]] ([[709\u2013700 BC|701 BC]]) led a powerful army into Judah. Hezekiah was reduced to despair, and submitted to the Assyrians ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:14\u201316|HE}}). But after a brief interval, war broke out again. Again Sennacherib led an army into Judah, one detachment of which threatened Jerusalem ({{bibleverse||Isaiah|36:2\u201322|HE}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:8|HE}}). Isaiah on that occasion encouraged Hezekiah to resist the Assyrians ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:1\u20137|HE}}), whereupon Sennacherib sent a threatening letter to Hezekiah, which he \"spread before the LORD\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:14|HE}}).<ref name=\"Easton1897\"/>\n\n{{quote|Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying: \"Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel: Whereas thou hast prayed to Me against Sennacherib king of Assyria,\n\nthis is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him: The virgin daughter of Zion hath despised thee and laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken her head at thee.\n\nWhom hast thou taunted and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? Yea, thou hast lifted up thine eyes on high, even against the Holy One of Israel!\" ({{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|37:21\u201323|HE}})}}\n\nAccording to the account in 2 Kings 19 (and its derivative account in 2 Chronicles 32) an angel of God fell on the Assyrian army and 185,000 of its men were killed in one night. \"Like [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] in Greece, Sennacherib never recovered from the shock of the disaster in Judah.

The [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more [[subroutines]], and then into another language (often [[machine code]]).\n\nThe terms ''interpreted language'' and ''[[compiled language]]'' are not well defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation, it is increasingly popular for a platform to provide both options.\n\nInterpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages. Functionally, both execution and interpretation mean the same thing \u2014 fetching the next instruction/statement from the program and executing it. Although interpreted [[byte code]] is additionally identical to machine code in form and has an [[assembly language|assembler]] representation, the term \"interpreted\" is practically reserved for \"software processed\" languages (by [[virtual machine]] or [[emulator]]) on top of the native (i.e. [[computer hardware|hardware]]) processor.\n\nIn principle, programs in many languages may be compiled or interpreted, emulated or executed natively, so this designation is applied solely based on common implementation practice, rather than representing an essential property of a language.\n\nMany languages have been implemented using both compilers and interpreters, including [[BASIC]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] are compiled into [[bytecode]], the [[interpreted language#Languages usually compiled to a bytecode|virtual-machine-friendly interpreted language]]. [[List of Lisp-family programming languages|Lisp implementations]] can freely mix interpreted and compiled code.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the early days of computing, language design was heavily influenced by the decision to use compiling or interpreting as a mode of execution. For example, [[Smalltalk]] (1980), which was designed to be interpreted at run-time, allows generic objects to dynamically interact with each other.\n\nInitially, interpreted languages were compiled line-by-line; that is, each line was compiled as it was about to be executed, and if a loop or subroutine caused certain lines to be executed multiple times, they would be recompiled every time. This has become much less common. Most so-called interpreted languages use an [[intermediate representation]], which combines compiling and interpreting.\n\nExamples include: \n* [[JavaScript]]\n* [[Python (programming language)|Python]]\n* BASIC\n* [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]\n\nThe intermediate representation can be compiled once and for all (as in Java), each time before execution (as in Perl or Ruby), or each time a change in the source is detected before execution (as in Python).\n\n==Advantages==\nInterpreting a language gives implementations some additional flexibility over compiled implementations.  Features that are often easier to implement in interpreters than in compilers include:\n* [[platform independent|platform independence]] (Java's byte code, for example)\n* [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]] and reflective use of the evaluator (e.g. a first-order [[eval]] function)\n* [[dynamic typing]]\n* smaller executable program size (since implementations have flexibility to choose the instruction code)\n* [[scope (programming)#Dynamic scoping|dynamic scoping]]\n\nFurthermore, source code can be read and copied, giving users more freedom.\n\n==Disadvantages==\nDisadvantages of interpreted languages are:\n* Without [[static type-checking]], which is usually performed by a compiler, programs can be less reliable, because type checking eliminates a class of programming errors (though type-checking of the code can be done by using additional stand-alone tools. See [[TypeScript]] for instance)\n* Interpreters can be susceptible to [[Code injection]] attacks.\n* Slower execution compared to direct native [[machine code]] execution on the host [[CPU]]. A technique used to improve performance is [[just-in-time compilation]] which converts frequently executed sequences of interpreted instruction to host machine code. JIT is most often combined with compilation to byte-code as in [[Java (programming language)|Java]].\n* Source code can be read and copied (e.g. [[JavaScript]] in web pages), or more easily reverse engineered through [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]] in applications where intellectual property has a commercial advantage. In some cases, [[obfuscation (software)|obfuscation]] is used as a partial defense against this.\n\n==List of frequently used interpreted languages==\n*[[APL (programming language)|APL]] A vector oriented language using an unusual character set\n**[[J (programming language)|J]] An APL variant in which tacit definition provides some of the benefits of compiling\n*[[BASIC]] (although the original version, Dartmouth BASIC, was compiled, as are many modern BASICs)\n**[[thinBasic]]\n*Equation manipulation and solving systems\n**[[GNU Octave]]\n**[[IDL (programming language)|Interactive Data Language]] (IDL)\n**[[TK Solver]]\n**[[Mathematica]]\n**[[MATLAB]]\n*[[Euphoria (programming language)|Euphoria]] Interpreted or compiled.\n*[[GameMaker Studio|GameMaker Language]]\n*[[JavaScript]]\n*[[Forth (programming language)|Forth]]\n*[[Lava (programming language)|Lava]]\n*[[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]\n**[[Logo (programming language)|Logo]]\n**[[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]]\n*Madness Script\n*[[MUMPS]]\n*[[Perl]]\n*[[PHP]]\n*[[PostScript]]\n*[[PowerShell]]\n*[[REXX]]\n*[[Seed7]]\n*[[Smalltalk]]\n**[[Bistro (programming language)|Bistro]]\n**[[Dolphin Smalltalk]]\n**[[F-Script (programming language)|F-Script]]\n**[[Little Smalltalk]]\n**[[Squeak]]\n**[[VisualAge]]\n**[[VisualWorks]]\n*[[Spreadsheet]]s\n**[[Microsoft Excel|Excel]]\n*[[S (programming language)|S]]\n**[[R (programming language)|R]]\n*[[Tcl]]\n**[[XOTcl]]\n*[[VBScript]]\n*XMLmosaic \u2013 an xml contained C# like programming language interpreted by a console application written in Visual Basic .NET<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xmlmosaic.codeplex.com|title=CodePlex Archive|author=|date=|website=CodePlex Archive|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Languages usually compiled to a bytecode===\nMany languages are first compiled to [[bytecode]]. \u0405ometimes, bytecode can also be compiled to a native binary using an [[AOT compiler]] or executed natively, by hardware processor.\n*[[AppleScript]]\n*[[Erlang (programming language)|Erlang]] (compiled into Erlang bytecode and interpreted by the BEAM VM)\n** [[Elixir (programming language)|Elixir]] (runs on the Erlang VM)\n*[[Java (programming language)|Java]] (is compiled into Java bytecode to be interpreted by [[JVM]])\n**[[Clojure]]\n**[[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]]\n**[[Kotlin (programming language)|Kotlin]]\n**[[ColdFusion]]\n**[[Scala (programming language)|Scala]]\n*[[.NET Framework]] languages (translated to bytecode, called [[Common Intermediate Language|CIL]]). \n**[[C++/CLI]]\n**[[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]]\n**[[Visual Basic .NET]]\n**[[F Sharp (programming language)|F#]]\n*[[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]\n*[[Lua (programming language)|Lua]]\n*[[Pike (programming language)|Pike]]\n*[[Python (programming language)|Python]] (compiled into Python bytecode and interpreted by [[CPython]])\n*[[Squeak Smalltalk]]\n*[[Visual FoxPro]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of interpreted languages]]\n* [[Compiled language]]\n* [[Executable]]\n* [[Managed code]]\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book |last=Brown |first=P.J. |date=1979 |title=Writing Interactive Compilers and Interpreters |location= |publisher=John Wiley |isbn=0-471-27609-X }}\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Programming language classification]]", "sha1": "r2fg70g7a9xe1icmeoruoexbwyd0365"}}, {"title": "Id", "ns": "0", "id": "15092", "redirect": {"title": "ID"}, "revision": {"id": "771884440", "parentid": "730369960", "timestamp": "2017-03-24T01:51:55Z", "contributor": {"username": "MRD2014", "id": "21640150"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Convert to {{Rcat shell}}", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[ID]]\n\n{{Rcat shell|\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n{{R from ambiguous page}}\n}}", "sha1": "77ed51wjgm1jng8hq86qlwrlssr0sfg"}}, {"title": "Intifada", "ns": "0", "id": "15095", "revision": {"id": "792185623", "parentid": "789733414", "timestamp": "2017-07-25T00:26:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ceosad", "id": "21006524"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* List of events named Intifada */ dashes", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-30-500|small=yes}}\n{{distinguish|Infitah}}\n'''Intifada''' ({{lang|ar|\u0627\u0646\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0636\u0629}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|intif\u0101\u1e0dah}}'') is an [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]] word literally meaning, as a noun, \"tremor\", \"shivering\", \"shuddering\".<ref name=\"Roberson\">Mary K.Roberson, 'Birth, Transformation, and Death of Refugee Identity: Women and Girls of the Intifada,' in Ellen Cole,Esther D Rothblum,Oliva M Espin (eds.)

Sixty years later, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] received the first trans-Atlantic radio signal on December 12, 1901, in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]] (now in [[Canada]]) using a {{convert|152.4|m|ft|abbr=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception. The transmitting station in [[Poldhu]], Cornwall, used a spark-gap [[transmitter]] to produce a signal with a [[frequency]] of approximately 500&nbsp;[[Kilohertz|kHz]] and a power of 100 times more than any radio signal previously produced. The message received was three dits, the [[Morse code]] for the letter '''S'''. To reach Newfoundland the signal would have to bounce off the ionosphere twice. Dr. [[Jack Belrose]] has contested this, however, based on theoretical and experimental work.<ref>John S.

Heaviside's proposal included means by which radio signals are transmitted around the Earth's curvature. Heaviside's proposal, coupled with Planck's law of black body radiation, may have hampered the growth of radio astronomy for the detection of electromagnetic waves from celestial bodies until 1932 (and the development of high-frequency radio transceivers). Also in 1902, [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly]] discovered some of the ionosphere's radio-electrical properties.\n\nIn 1912, the [[U.S. Congress]] imposed the [[Radio Act of 1912]] on [[amateur radio operators]], limiting their operations to frequencies above 1.5&nbsp;MHz (wavelength 200 meters or smaller). The government thought those frequencies were useless. This led to the discovery of HF radio propagation via the ionosphere in 1923.\n\nIn 1926, Scottish physicist [[Robert Watson-Watt]] introduced the term ''ionosphere'' in a letter published only in 1969 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'':\n\n{{Quotation|We have in quite recent years seen the universal adoption of the term 'stratosphere'..and..the companion term 'troposphere'... The term 'ionosphere', for the region in which the main characteristic is large scale ionisation with considerable mean free paths, appears appropriate as an addition to this series.}}\n\nIn the early 1930s, test transmissions of [[Radio Luxembourg]] inadvertently provided evidence of the first radio modification of the ionosphere; [[HAARP]] ran a series of experiments in 2017 using the eponymous Luxembourg Effect.<ref name=\"Gakona HAARPoon 2017\">{{Cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/gakonahaarpoon/operations-news |title=Gakona HAARPoon 2017 |date=2017-02-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220175950/https://sites.google.com/alaska.edu/gakonahaarpoon/operations-news |archivedate=2017-02-20 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[Edward V. Appleton]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1947 for his confirmation in 1927 of the existence of the ionosphere. [[Lloyd Berkner]] first measured the height and density of the ionosphere. This permitted the first complete theory of short-wave radio propagation. [[Maurice V. Wilkes]] and [[J. A. Ratcliffe]] researched the topic of radio propagation of very long radio waves in the ionosphere. [[Vitaly Ginzburg]] has developed a theory of electromagnetic wave propagation in plasmas such as the ionosphere.\n\nIn 1962, the [[Canada|Canadian]] satellite [[Alouette 1]] was launched to study the ionosphere. Following its success were [[Alouette 2]] in 1965 and the two [[ISIS (satellite)|ISIS]] satellites in 1969 and 1971, further AEROS-A  and -B in 1972 and 1975, all for measuring the ionosphere.\n\nOn July 26, 1963 the first operational geosynchronous satellite Syncom 2 was launched.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harveycohen.net/crcss/history.html|title=Firsts in the Space Race.

Australian geophysicist Elizabeth Essex-Cohen from 1969 onwards was using this technique to monitor the atmosphere above Australia and Antarctica.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harveycohen.net/essex|title=Elizabeth  A.

It exists primarily due to [[ultraviolet]] radiation from the [[Sun]].\n\nThe lowest part of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], the [[troposphere]] extends from the surface to about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Above that is the [[stratosphere]], followed by the [[mesosphere]]. In the stratosphere incoming solar radiation creates the [[ozone layer]]. At heights of above {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in the [[thermosphere]], the atmosphere is so thin that free electrons can exist for short periods of time before they are captured by a nearby positive [[ion]]. The number of these free electrons is sufficient to affect [[radio propagation]]. This portion of the atmosphere is partially ''ionized'' and contains a [[Plasma physics|plasma]] which is referred to as the ionosphere.\n\n[[Ultraviolet]] (UV), [[X-ray]] and shorter [[wavelength]]s of [[solar radiation]] are ''ionizing,'' since [[photon]]s at these frequencies contain sufficient energy to dislodge an [[electron]] from a neutral gas [[atom]] or [[molecule]] upon absorption. In this process the light electron obtains a high velocity so that the [[temperature]] of the created electronic gas is much higher (of the order of thousand K) than the one of ions and neutrals. The reverse process to [[ionization]] is [[Recombination (chemistry)|recombination]], in which a free electron is \"captured\" by a positive ion. Recombination occurs spontaneously, and causes the emission of a photon carrying away the energy produced upon recombination. As gas density increases at lower altitudes, the recombination process prevails, since the gas molecules and ions are closer together. The balance between these two processes determines the quantity of ionization present.\n\nIonization depends primarily on the [[Sun]] and its [[solar variation|activity]]. The amount of ionization in the ionosphere varies greatly with the amount of radiation received from the Sun. Thus there is a [[Day|diurnal]] (time of day) effect and a seasonal effect. The local winter [[Earth|hemisphere]] is tipped away from the Sun, thus there is less received solar radiation. The activity of the Sun is associated with the [[sunspot cycle]], with more radiation occurring with more sunspots. Radiation received also varies with geographical location (polar, [[auroral]] zones, [[mid-latitudes]], and equatorial regions). There are also mechanisms that disturb the ionosphere and decrease the ionization. There are disturbances such as [[solar flare]]s and the associated release of charged particles into the [[solar wind]] which reaches the Earth and interacts with its [[geomagnetic]] field.\n\n==The ionospheric layers==\n[[File:Ionosphere Layers en.svg|thumb|400px|Ionospheric layers....]]\n\nAt night the F layer is the only layer of significant ionization present, while the ionization in the E and D layers is extremely low. During the day, the D and E layers become much more heavily ionized, as does the F layer, which develops an additional, weaker region of ionisation known as the F<sub>1</sub> layer. The F<sub>2</sub> layer persists by day and night and is the main region responsible for the refraction and reflection of radio waves.\n\n===D layer===\nThe D layer is the innermost layer, {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface of the Earth. Ionization here is due to [[Lyman series]]-alpha hydrogen radiation at a [[wavelength]] of 121.6 [[nanometre]] (nm) ionizing [[nitric oxide]] (NO). In addition, high [[space weather|solar activity]] can generate hard X-rays (wavelength {{nowrap|< 1 nm}}) that ionize N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>. Recombination rates are high in the D layer, so there are many more neutral air molecules than ions.\n\nMedium frequency (MF) and lower high frequency (HF) [[radio wave]]s are significantly attenuated within the D layer, as the passing radio waves cause electrons to move, which then collide with the neutral molecules, giving up their energy. Lower frequencies experience greater absorption because they move the electrons farther, leading to greater chance of collisions. This is the main reason for [[Ionospheric absorption|absorption of HF radio waves]], particularly at 10&nbsp;MHz and below, with progressively less absorption at higher frequencies. This effect peaks around noon and is reduced at night due to a decrease in the D layer's thickness; only a small part remains due to [[cosmic rays]]. A common example of the D layer in action is the disappearance of distant AM [[broadcast band]] stations in the daytime.\n\nDuring [[solar proton event]]s, ionization can reach unusually high levels in the D-region over high and polar latitudes. Such very rare events are known as Polar Cap Absorption (or PCA) events, because the increased ionization significantly enhances the absorption of radio signals passing through the region.<ref name=\"Rose1962\">{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=D.C.|last2=Ziauddin|first2=Syed|title=The polar cap absorption effect|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=June 1962|volume=1|issue=1|pages=115|doi=10.1007/BF00174638|accessdate=|bibcode=1962SSRv....1..115R}}</ref> In fact, absorption levels can increase by many tens of dB during intense events, which is enough to absorb most (if not all) transpolar HF radio signal transmissions. Such events typically last less than 24 to 48 hours.\n\n===E layer===\nThe [[Kennelly\u2013Heaviside layer|E layer]] is the middle layer, {{convert|90|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface of the Earth. Ionization is due to soft X-ray (1\u201310&nbsp;nm) and far ultraviolet (UV) solar radiation ionization of molecular [[oxygen]] (O<sub>2</sub>). Normally, at oblique incidence, this layer can only reflect radio waves having frequencies lower than about 10&nbsp;MHz and may contribute a bit to absorption on frequencies above. However, during intense [[sporadic E]] events, the E<sub>s</sub> layer can reflect frequencies up to 50&nbsp;MHz and higher. The vertical structure of the E layer is primarily determined by the competing effects of ionization and recombination. At night the E layer weakens because the primary source of ionization is no longer present. After sunset an increase in the height of the E layer maximum increases the range to which radio waves can travel by reflection from the layer.\n\nThis region is also known as the [[Kennelly\u2013Heaviside layer]] or simply the Heaviside layer. Its existence was predicted in 1902 independently and almost simultaneously by the American electrical engineer [[Arthur Edwin Kennelly]] (1861\u20131939) and the British physicist [[Oliver Heaviside]] (1850\u20131925). However, it was not until 1924 that its existence was detected by [[Edward V. Appleton]] and [[Miles Aylmer Fulton Barnett|Miles Barnett]].\n\n===E<sub>s</sub>===\nThe E<sub>s</sub> layer ([[wikt:sporadic#Adjective|sporadic]] E-layer) is characterized by small, thin clouds of intense ionization, which can support reflection of radio waves, rarely up to 225&nbsp;MHz. Sporadic-E events may last for just a few minutes to several hours. [[Sporadic E propagation]] makes VHF-operating [[Amateur radio high bands|radio amateurs]] very excited, as propagation paths that are generally unreachable can open up. There are multiple causes of sporadic-E that are still being pursued by researchers. This propagation occurs most frequently during the summer months when high signal levels may be reached. The skip distances are generally around {{convert|1640|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Distances for one hop propagation can be anywhere from {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2500|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Double-hop reception over {{convert|3500|km|mi|abbr=on}} is possible.\n\n===F layer===\n{{main|F region}}\n\nThe [[F region|F layer]] or region, also known as the Appleton\u2013Barnett layer, extends from about {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} above the surface of Earth. It is the layer with the highest electron density, which implies signals penetrating this layer will escape into space. Electron production is dominated by [[extreme ultraviolet]] (UV, 10\u2013100&nbsp;nm) radiation ionizing atomic oxygen. The F layer consists of one layer (F<sub>2</sub>) at night, but during the day, a secondary peak (labelled F<sub>1</sub>) often forms in the electron density profile. Because the F<sub>2</sub> layer remains by day and night, it is responsible for most [[skywave]] propagation of [[radio]] waves and long distances [[high frequency]] (HF, or [[shortwave]]) radio communications.\n\nAbove the F layer, the number of [[oxygen]] ions decreases and lighter ions such as hydrogen and helium become dominant. This region above the F layer peak and below the [[plasmasphere]] is called the topside ionosphere.\n\nFrom 1972 to 1975 [[NASA]] launched the [[AEROS (satellite)|AEROS and AEROS B]] satellites to study the F region.<ref name=\"Yenne\">{{cite book|author=Yenne, Bill|title=''The Encyclopedia of US Spacecraft''|publisher=Exeter Books (A Bison Book), New York|date=1985|isbn=978-0-671-07580-4}} p. 12 '''AEROS'''</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Ionospheric model}}Ionospheric model==\nAn '''ionospheric model''' is a mathematical description of the ionosphere as a function of location, altitude, day of year, phase of the sunspot cycle and geomagnetic activity. Geophysically, the state of the ionospheric [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] may be described by four parameters: ''electron density, electron and ion [[temperature]]'' and, since several species of ions are present, ''ionic composition''. [[Radio propagation]] depends uniquely on electron density.\n\nModels are usually expressed as computer programs.  The model may be based on basic physics of the interactions of the ions and electrons with the neutral atmosphere and sunlight, or it may be a statistical description based on a large number of observations or a combination of physics and observations. One of the most widely used models is the [[International Reference Ionosphere]] (IRI),<ref>Bilitza, 2001</ref> which is based on data and specifies the four parameters just mentioned. The IRI is an international project sponsored by the [[Committee on Space Research]] (COSPAR) and the [[International Union of Radio Science]] (URSI).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/ionos/iri.html |title=International Reference Ionosphere |publisher=Ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223151912/http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/ionos/iri.html |archivedate=2011-02-23 |df= }}</ref> The major data sources are the worldwide network of [[ionosonde]]s, the powerful [[incoherent scatter]] radars (Jicamarca, [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]], Millstone Hill, Malvern, St Santin), the ISIS and Alouette topside sounders, and in situ instruments on several satellites and rockets. IRI is updated yearly. IRI is more accurate in describing the variation of the electron density from bottom of the ionosphere to the altitude of maximum density than in describing the [[total electron content]] (TEC). Since 1999 this model is \"International Standard\" for the terrestrial ionosphere (standard TS16457).\n\n==Persistent anomalies to the idealized model==\n[[Ionogram]]s allow deducing, via computation, the true shape of the different layers. Nonhomogeneous structure of the [[electron]]/[[ion]]-[[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] produces rough echo traces, seen predominantly at night and at higher latitudes, and during disturbed conditions.\n\n===Winter anomaly===\nAt mid-latitudes, the F<sub>2</sub> layer daytime ion production is higher in the summer, as expected, since the Sun shines more directly on the Earth. However, there are seasonal changes in the molecular-to-atomic ratio of the neutral atmosphere that cause the summer ion loss rate to be even higher. The result is that the increase in the summertime loss overwhelms the increase in summertime production, and total F<sub>2</sub> ionization is actually lower in the local summer months. This effect is known as the winter anomaly. The anomaly is always present in the northern hemisphere, but is usually absent in the southern hemisphere during periods of low solar activity.\n\n===Equatorial anomaly===\n[[Image:Diurnal ionospheric current.jpg|frame|right|Electric currents created in sunward ionosphere.]]\nWithin approximately \u00b1 20 degrees of the ''magnetic equator'', is the ''[[equator]]ial anomaly''. It is the occurrence of a trough in the ionization in the F<sub>2</sub> layer at the equator and crests at about 17 degrees in magnetic latitude. The Earth's [[magnetic field]] lines are horizontal at the magnetic equator. Solar heating and [[tidal]] oscillations in the lower ionosphere move plasma up and across the magnetic field lines. This sets up a sheet of electric current in the E region which, with the [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]] magnetic field, forces ionization up into the F layer, concentrating at \u00b1 20 degrees from the magnetic equator. This phenomenon is known as the ''equatorial fountain''.\n\n===Equatorial electrojet===\nThe worldwide solar-driven wind results in the so-called Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere ([[ionospheric dynamo region]]) ({{convert|100\u2013130|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude). Resulting from this current is an electrostatic field directed west\u2013east (dawn\u2013dusk) in the equatorial day side of the ionosphere. At the magnetic dip equator, where the geomagnetic field is horizontal, this electric field results in an enhanced eastward current flow within \u00b1 3 degrees of the magnetic equator, known as the [[equatorial electrojet]].\n\n==Ephemeral ionospheric perturbations==\n===X-rays: sudden ionospheric disturbances (SID)===\nWhen the Sun is active, strong [[solar flare]]s can occur that will hit the sunlit side of Earth with hard X-rays. The X-rays will penetrate to the D-region, releasing electrons that will rapidly increase absorption, causing a high frequency (3\u201330&nbsp;MHz) radio blackout. During this time very low frequency (3\u201330&nbsp;kHz) signals will be reflected by the D layer instead of the E layer, where the increased atmospheric density will usually increase the absorption of the wave and thus dampen it. As soon as the X-rays end, the [[sudden ionospheric disturbance]] (SID) or radio black-out ends as the electrons in the D-region recombine rapidly and signal strengths return to normal.\n\n===Protons: polar cap absorption (PCA)===\nAssociated with solar flares is a release of high-energy protons. These particles can hit the Earth within 15 minutes to 2 hours of the solar flare. The protons spiral around and down the magnetic field lines of the Earth and penetrate into the atmosphere near the magnetic poles increasing the ionization of the D and E layers. PCA's typically last anywhere from about an hour to several days, with an average of around 24 to 36 hours. [[Coronal mass ejection]]s can also release energetic protons that enhance D-region absorption in the polar regions.\n\n===Geomagnetic storms===\nA [[geomagnetic storm]] is a temporary intense disturbance of the Earth's [[magnetosphere]].\n* During a geomagnetic storm the F\u2082 layer will become unstable, fragment, and may even disappear completely.\n* In the Northern and Southern pole regions of the Earth [[polar aurora|aurora]]e will be observable in the sky.\n\n===Lightning===\n[[Lightning]] can cause ionospheric perturbations in the D-region in one of two ways. The first is through VLF (very low frequency) radio waves launched into the [[magnetosphere]]. These so-called \"whistler\" mode waves can interact with radiation belt particles and cause them to precipitate onto the ionosphere, adding ionization to the D-region. These disturbances are called \"lightning-induced [[electron precipitation]]\" (LEP) events.\n\nAdditional ionization can also occur from direct heating/ionization as a result of huge motions of charge in lightning strikes. These events are called early/fast.\n\nIn 1925, C. T. R. Wilson proposed a mechanism by which electrical discharge from lightning storms could propagate upwards from clouds to the ionosphere. Around the same time, Robert Watson-Watt, working at the Radio Research Station in Slough, UK, suggested that the ionospheric sporadic E layer (E<sub>s</sub>) appeared to be enhanced as a result of lightning but that more work was needed. In 2005, C. Davis and C. Johnson, working at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, UK, demonstrated that the E<sub>s</sub> layer was indeed enhanced as a result of lightning activity. Their subsequent research has focused on the mechanism by which this process can occur.\n\n==Applications==\n===Radio communication{{anchor|Radio application}}===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Triple J]] -->\nDue to the ability of ionized atmospheric gases to [[refract]] high frequency (HF, or [[shortwave]]) radio waves, the ionosphere can reflect radio waves directed into the sky back toward the Earth.  Radio waves directed at an angle into the sky can return to Earth beyond the horizon.  This technique, called \"skip\" or \"[[skywave]]\" propagation, has been used since the 1920s to communicate at international or intercontinental distances.  The returning radio waves can reflect off the Earth's surface into the sky again, allowing greater ranges to be achieved with multiple [[Hop (telecommunications)|hop]]s. This communication method is variable and unreliable, with reception over a given path depending on time of day or night, the seasons, weather, and the 11-year [[sunspot cycle]].  During the first half of the 20th century it was widely used for transoceanic telephone and telegraph service, and business and diplomatic communication. Due to its relative unreliability, shortwave radio communication has been mostly abandoned by the telecommunications industry, though it remains important for high-latitude communication where satellite-based radio communication is not possible. Some broadcasting stations and automated services still use [[shortwave radio]] frequencies, as do [[radio amateur]] hobbyists for private recreational contacts.\n\n====Mechanism of refraction====\nWhen a radio wave reaches the ionosphere, the [[electric field]] in the wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into [[oscillation]] at the same frequency as the radio wave. Some of the radio-frequency energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either be lost to recombination or will re-radiate the original wave energy. Total refraction can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere is less than the radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.\n\nA qualitative understanding of how an electromagnetic wave propagates through the ionosphere can be obtained by recalling [[geometric optics]].  Since the ionosphere is a plasma, it can be shown that the [[refractive index]] is less than unity.  Hence, the electromagnetic \"ray\" is bent away from the normal rather than toward the normal as would be indicated when the refractive index is greater than unity.  It can also be shown that the refractive index of a plasma, and hence the ionosphere, is frequency-dependent, see [[Dispersion (optics)]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lied|first1=Finn|title=High Frequency Radio Communications with Emphasis on Polar Problems|date=1967|publisher=Advisory Group for Aerospace Research and Development|pages=1\u20136}}</ref>\n\nThe [[critical frequency]] is the limiting frequency at or below which a radio wave is reflected by an ionospheric layer at vertical [[angle of incidence (optics)|incidence]]. If the transmitted frequency is higher than the [[plasma frequency]] of the ionosphere, then the electrons cannot respond fast enough, and they are not able to re-radiate the signal. It is calculated as shown below:\n\n: <math>f_{\\text{critical}} = 9 \\times\\sqrt{N}</math>\n\nwhere N = electron density per m<sup>3</sup> and f<sub>critical</sub> is in Hz.\n\nThe Maximum Usable Frequency (MUF) is defined as the upper frequency limit that can be used for transmission between two points at a specified time.\n\n: <math>f_\\text{muf} = \\frac{f_\\text{critical}}{ \\sin \\alpha} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> = [[angle of attack]], the angle of the wave relative to the [[horizon]], and sin is the [[sine]] function.\n\nThe [[cutoff frequency]] is the frequency below which a radio wave fails to penetrate a layer of the ionosphere at the incidence angle required for transmission between two specified points by refraction from the layer.\n\n===Other applications===\nThe [[open system (systems theory)|open system]] [[electrodynamic tether]], which uses the ionosphere, is being researched. The [[space tether]] uses plasma contactors and the ionosphere as parts of a circuit to extract energy from the Earth's magnetic field by [[electromagnetic induction]].\n\n==Measurements==\n===Overview===\nScientists explore the structure of the ionosphere by a wide variety of methods. They include:\n* passive observations of optical and radio emissions generated in the ionosphere\n* bouncing radio waves of different frequencies from it\n* [[incoherent scatter]] radars such as the [[EISCAT]], Sondre Stromfjord, [[Millstone Hill Observatory|Millstone Hill]], [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]], and [[Jicamarca Radio Observatory|Jicamarca]] radars\n* coherent scatter radars such as the [[Super Dual Auroral Radar Network|Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN)]] radars,\n* special receivers to detect how the reflected waves have changed from the transmitted waves.\n\nA variety of experiments, such as HAARP ([[High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program]]), involve high power radio transmitters to modify the properties of the ionosphere. These investigations focus on studying the properties and behavior of ionospheric plasma, with particular emphasis on being able to understand and use it to enhance communications and surveillance systems for both civilian and military purposes. HAARP was started in 1993 as a proposed twenty-year experiment, and is currently active near Gakona, Alaska.\n\nThe SuperDARN radar project researches the high- and mid-latitudes using coherent backscatter of radio waves in the 8 to 20&nbsp;MHz range. Coherent backscatter is similar to Bragg scattering in crystals and involves the constructive interference of scattering from ionospheric density irregularities. The project involves more than 11 different countries and multiple radars in both hemispheres.\n\nScientists are also examining the ionosphere by the changes to radio waves, from satellites and stars, passing through it. The [[Arecibo radio telescope]] located in [[Puerto Rico]], was originally intended to study Earth's ionosphere.\n\n===Ionograms===\n{{main|Ionogram}}\nIonograms show the virtual heights and '''critical frequencies''' of the ionospheric layers and which are measured by an [[ionosonde]]. An ionosonde sweeps a range of frequencies, usually from 0.1 to 30&nbsp;MHz, transmitting at vertical incidence to the ionosphere. As the frequency increases, each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer, and so each penetrates further before it is reflected. Eventually, a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected. For ordinary mode waves, this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma, or critical, frequency of the layer. Tracings of the reflected high frequency radio pulses are known as ionograms. Reduction rules are given in: \"URSI Handbook of Ionogram Interpretation and Reduction\", edited by [[William Roy Piggott]] and [[Karl Rawer]], Elsevier Amsterdam, 1961 (translations into Chinese, French, Japanese and Russian are available).\n\n===Incoherent scatter radars===\n[[Incoherent scatter]] radars operate above the critical frequencies. Therefore, the technique allows probing the ionosphere, unlike ionosondes, also above the electron density peaks. The thermal fluctuations of the electron density scattering the transmitted signals lack [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]], which gave the technique its name. Their power spectrum contains information not only on the density, but also on the ion and electron temperatures, ion masses and drift velocities.\n\n=== GNSS radio occultation ===\n[[Radio occultation]] is a remote sensing technique where a GNSS signal tangentially scrapes the Earth, passing through the atmosphere, and is received by a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. As the signal passes through the atmosphere, it is refracted, curved and delayed. An LEO satellite samples the total electron content and bending angle of many such signal paths as it watches the GNSS satellite rise or set behind the Earth. Using an Inverse [[Abel transform|Abel's transform]], a radial profile of refractivity at that tangent point on earth can be reconstructed.\n\nMajor GNSS radio occultation missions include the [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment|GRACE]], [[CHAMP (satellite)|CHAMP]], and [[Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate|COSMIC]].\n\n== Indices of the ionosphere ==\nIn empirical models of the ionosphere such as Nequick, the following indices are used as indirect indicators of the state of the ionosphere.\n\n===Solar intensity===\nF10.7 and R12 are two indices commonly used in ionospheric modelling. Both are valuable for their long historical records covering multiple solar cycles. F10.7 is a measurement of the intensity of solar radio emissions at a frequency of 2800&nbsp;MHz made using a ground [[radio telescope]]. R12 is a 12 months average of daily sunspot numbers.  Both indices have been shown to be correlated to each other.\n\nHowever, both indices are only indirect indicators of solar ultraviolet and X-ray emissions, which are primarily responsible for causing ionization in the Earth's upper atmosphere. We now have data from the [[GOES]] spacecraft that measures the background '''X-ray flux''' from the Sun, a parameter more closely related to the ionization levels in the ionosphere.\n\n=== Geomagnetic disturbances ===\n* The ''[[A-index|A]]''- and ''[[K-index|K]]''-indices are a measurement of the behavior of the horizontal component of the '''geomagnetic field'''. The ''K''-index uses a scale from 0 to 9 to measure the change in the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. A new ''K''-index is determined at the [[Boulder Geomagnetic Observatory]].\n* The geomagnetic activity levels of the Earth are measured by the fluctuation of the Earth's magnetic field in [[SI]] units called [[tesla (unit)|tesla]]s (or in non-SI [[gauss (unit)|gauss]], especially in older literature). The Earth's magnetic field is measured around the planet by many observatories. The data retrieved is processed and turned into measurement indices. Daily measurements for the entire planet are made available through an estimate of the ''A''<sub>p</sub>-index, called the ''planetary A-index'' (PAI).\n\n==GPS/GNSS ionospheric correction==\n{{stub section|date=October 2013}}\n{{see also|Total electron content}}\nThere are a number of models used to understand the effects of the ionosphere global navigation satellite systems.

Interlingua was developed to combine a simple, mostly regular grammar<ref>See Gopsill, F. P. ''Interlingua: A course for beginners.'' Part 1. Sheffield, England: British Interlingua Society, 1987. Gopsill, here and elsewhere, characterizes Interlingua as having a simple grammar and no irregularities.</ref><ref>The [[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]] suggests that Interlingua has a small number of irregularities.

These [[morpheme]]s are identical in Interlingua. Thus, \"Interlingua\" would mean \"between language\".\n\n== Rationale ==\nThe expansive movements of science, technology, trade, diplomacy, and the arts, combined with the historical dominance of the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] languages have resulted in a large common vocabulary among European languages. With Interlingua, an objective procedure is used to extract and standardize the most widespread word or words for a concept found in a set of ''control languages'': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], with [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] as secondary references. Words from any language are eligible for inclusion, so long as their internationality is shown by their presence in these control languages. Hence, Interlingua includes such diverse word forms as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''geisha'' and ''samurai'', [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''califa'', [[Guugu Yimithirr language|Guugu Yimithirr]] ''gangurru'' (Interlingua: kanguru), and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''sauna''.<ref name=\"iala1971\"/>\n\nInterlingua combines this pre-existing vocabulary with a minimal grammar based on the control languages. People with a good knowledge of a Romance language, or a smattering of a Romance language plus a good knowledge of the ''[[international scientific vocabulary]]'' can frequently understand it immediately on reading or hearing it. The immediate comprehension of Interlingua, in turn, makes it unusually easy to learn. Speakers of [[language|other languages]] can also learn to speak and write Interlingua in a short time, thanks to its simple grammar and regular word formation using a small number of [[root (linguistics)|roots]] and [[affix]]es.<ref name=\"many-represented\">[[Alice Vanderbilt Morris|Morris, Alice Vanderbilt]], ''[http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#manyrepresented General Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040702192153/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2004-07-02 }}'', New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.</ref>\n\nOnce learned, Interlingua can be used to learn other related languages quickly and easily, and in some studies, even to understand them immediately. Research with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one 1974 study, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text that students who had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/> Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp the mechanisms of language quickly.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/><ref name=\"many-represented\"/>\n\nWords in Interlingua retain their original form from the source language; they are altered as little as possible to fit Interlingua's [[phonotactics]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  Each word retains its original spelling, pronunciation, and meanings. For this reason, Interlingua is frequently termed a ''naturalistic'' IAL.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nWhen compared to natural languages, Interlingua most resembles [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{according to whom|date=April 2017}}\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Interlingua}}\n\n<!--[[Image:Interlinguadeiala-tenue&latin.jpg|thumb|One of the many unofficial logo designs created for Interlingua, displaying the main logo with a \"control language\" flag montage below.{{Deletable image-caption|Monday, 30 August 2010|date=May 2012}}]]-->\nThe American heiress [[Alice Vanderbilt Morris]] (1874\u20131950) became interested in [[linguistics]] and the [[international auxiliary language]] movement in the early 1920s, and in 1924, Morris and her husband, [[Dave Hennen Morris]], established the non-profit International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA) in [[New York City]]. Their aim was to place the study of IALs on a scientific basis. Morris developed the research program of IALA in consultation with [[Edward Sapir]], [[William Edward Collinson]], and [[Otto Jespersen]].<ref>Falk, Julia S. \"Words without grammar: Linguists and the international language movement in the United States, ''Language and Communication'', 15(3): pp. 241\u2013259. Pergamon, 1995.</ref>\n\n=== International Auxiliary Language Association ===\nThe IALA became a major supporter of mainstream American linguistics, funding, for example, numerous studies by Sapir, Collinson, and [[Morris Swadesh]] in the 1930s and 1940s. Alice Morris edited several of these studies and provided much of IALA's financial support.<ref name=\"iala1971_foreword\">Bray, Mary Connell [1951] (1971), \"Foreword\", [https://web.archive.org/web/20071006090121/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-foreword.html ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international Language''], Second Edition, New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Company. {{ISBN|0-8044-0188-8}}. {{OCLC|162319}}. Retrieved on 2010-04-18.</ref> IALA also received support from such prestigious groups as the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Ford Foundation]], the [[Research Corporation]], and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].<ref name=\"gopsill-historia\">Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-1.htm \"Le historia antenatal de interlingua\"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.</ref>\n\nIn its early years, IALA concerned itself with three tasks: finding other organizations around the world with similar goals; building a library of books about [[language]]s and [[interlinguistics]]; and comparing extant IALs, including [[Esperanto]], [[Esperanto II]], [[Ido (language)|Ido]], [[Latino sine flexione|Peano\u2019s Interlingua]] (Latino sine flexione), [[Novial]], and [[Occidental language|Interlingue]] (Occidental). In pursuit of the last goal, it conducted parallel studies of these languages, with comparative studies of national languages, under the direction of scholars at American and European universities.<ref name=\"iala1971_foreword\"/> It also arranged conferences with proponents of these IALs, who debated features and goals of their respective languages. With a \"concession rule\" that required participants to make a certain number of concessions, early debates at IALA sometimes grew from heated to explosive.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/>\n\nAt the Second International Interlanguage Congress, held in [[Geneva]] in 1931, IALA began to break new ground; 27 recognized linguists signed a testimonial of support for IALA's research program. An additional eight added their signatures at the third congress, convened in [[Rome]] in 1933.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/> That same year, [[Herbert N. Shenton]] and [[Edward L. Thorndike]] became influential in IALA's work by authoring key studies in the interlinguistic field.<ref name=\"iala1971_foreword\"/>\n\nThe first steps towards the finalization of Interlingua were taken in 1937, when a committee of 24 eminent linguists from 19 universities published ''Some Criteria for an International Language and Commentary''. However, the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939 cut short the intended biannual meetings of the committee.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/>\n\n===Development of a new language===\nOriginally, the association had not set out to create its own language. Its goal was to identify which auxiliary language already available was best suited for international communication, and how to promote it most effectively. However, after ten years of research, more and more members of IALA concluded that none of the existing [[interlanguage]]s were up to the task. By 1937, the members had made the decision to create a new language, to the surprise of the world's interlanguage community.<ref name=\"gopsill-historia2\">Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-2.htm \"Profunde recerca duce a un lingua\"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.</ref>\n\nTo that point, much of the debate had been equivocal on the decision to use naturalistic (e.g., [[Latino sine flexione|Peano\u2019s Interlingua]], [[Novial]] and [[Occidental language|Occidental]]) or systematic (e.g., [[Esperanto]] and [[Ido (language)|Ido]]) words. During the war years, proponents of a naturalistic interlanguage won out. The first support was Thorndike's paper; the second was a concession by proponents of the systematic languages that thousands of words were already present in many, or even a majority, of the European languages. Their argument was that systematic derivation of words was a [[Procrustes|Procrustean bed]], forcing the learner to unlearn and re-memorize a new derivation scheme when a usable vocabulary was already available. This finally convinced supporters of the systematic languages, and IALA from that point assumed the position that a naturalistic language would be best.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/>\n\nAt the outbreak of [[World War II]], IALA's research activities were moved from Liverpool to New York, where [[Ezra Clark Stillman|E. Clark Stillman]] established a new research staff.<ref name=\"iala1971_foreword\"/> Stillman, with the assistance of [[Alexander Gode]], developed a ''prototyping'' technique \u2013 an objective methodology for selecting and standardizing vocabulary based on a comparison of ''control languages''.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/>\n\nIn 1943 Stillman left for war work and Gode became Acting Director of Research.<ref name=\"iala1971_foreword\"/> IALA began to develop models of the proposed language, the first of which were presented in Morris's ''General Report'' in 1945.<ref name=\"gopsill-historia2\"/>\n\nFrom 1946 to 1948, French linguist [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]] was Director of Research. During this period IALA continued to develop models and conducted polling to determine the optimal form of the final language. In 1946, IALA sent an extensive survey to more than 3,000 language teachers and related professionals on three continents.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/><ref name=\"gopsill-historia3\">Gopsill, F. P., and Sexton, Brian, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/diverse/historia-3.htm \"Le natura, si \u2013 un schema, no\"], ''Historia de interlingua'', 2001, revised 2006.</ref>\n\nFour models were canvassed:<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/>\n\n{| border=0\n|- valign=top\n| &nbsp; || Model&nbsp;P || &nbsp; || highly&nbsp;naturalistic, with word forms unchanged from the prototypes\n|- valign=top\n| &nbsp; || Model&nbsp;M || &nbsp; || moderately&nbsp;naturalistic, similar to Occidental\n|- valign=top\n| &nbsp; || Model&nbsp;C || &nbsp; || slightly&nbsp;schematic, along the lines of Novial\n|- valign=top\n| &nbsp; || Model&nbsp;K || &nbsp; || moderately&nbsp;schematic, similar to Ido (less schematic than Esperanto)\n|}\n\nThe results of the survey were striking. The two more schematic models were rejected \u2013 K overwhelmingly. Of the two naturalistic models, M received somewhat more support than P. IALA decided on a compromise between P and M, with certain elements of C.<ref name=\"gopsill-historia3\"/>\n\nMartinet took up a position at [[Columbia University]] in 1948, and Gode took on the last phase of Interlingua's development.<ref name=\"iala1971_foreword\"/> The vocabulary and grammar of Interlingua were first presented in 1951, when IALA published the finalized ''[[Interlingua: A Grammar of the International Language|Interlingua Grammar]]'' and the 27,000-word ''[[Interlingua-English Dictionary|Interlingua\u2013English Dictionary]]'' (IED). In 1954, IALA  published an introductory manual entitled ''[[Interlingua a Prime Vista]]'' (\"Interlingua at First Sight\").\n\nInterlingua as presented by the IALA is very close to [[Latino sine flexione|Peano\u2019s Interlingua]] (Latino sine flexione), both in its grammar and especially in its vocabulary. Accordingly, the very name \"Interlingua\" was kept, yet a distinct abbreviation was adopted: IA instead of IL.\n\n===Success, decline, and resurgence===\nAn early practical application of Interlingua was the scientific newsletter ''Spectroscopia Molecular'', published from 1952 to 1980.<ref>Breinstrup, Thomas, [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/spectroscopia.htm \"Un revolution in le mundo scientific\" (A revolution in the scientific world).] Accessed January 16, 2007.</ref> In 1954, Interlingua was used at the Second World Cardiological Congress in [[Washington, D.C.]] for both written summaries and oral interpretation. Within a few years, it found similar use at nine further medical congresses. Between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, some thirty scientific and especially medical journals provided article summaries in Interlingua. [[Society for Science and the Public|Science Service]], the publisher of ''Science Newsletter'' at the time, published a monthly column in Interlingua from the early 1950s until Gode's death in 1970. In 1967, the [[International Organization for Standardization]], which normalizes terminology, voted almost unanimously to adopt Interlingua as the basis for its dictionaries.<ref name=\"gopsill1990\"/>\n\nThe [[International Auxiliary Language Association|IALA]] closed its doors in 1953 but was not formally dissolved until 1956 or later.<ref name = \"esterhill2000\"/> Its role in promoting Interlingua was largely taken on by Science Service,<ref name=\"gopsill-historia3\"/> which hired Gode as head of its newly formed [[Interlingua Division of Science Service|Interlingua Division]].<ref>[http://www.interlingua.com/historia/biographias/gode.htm Biographias: Alexander Gottfried Friedrich Gode-von Aesch].

The new institute supported the work of other linguistic organizations, made considerable scholarly contributions and produced Interlingua summaries for scholarly and medical publications.

P., ''Interlingua today: A course for beginners'', Sheffield, UK: British Interlingua Society, 1994.</ref> although {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/oi/}} are rare.\n\n=== Stress ===\nThe ''general rule'' is that stress falls on the vowel before the last consonant (e.g., ''l'''i'''ngua'', 'language', ''ess'''e'''r'', 'to be', ''requirim'''e'''nto'',  'requirement'), and where that is not possible, on the first vowel (''v'''i'''a'', 'way', '''''i'''o cr'''e'''a'', 'I create'). There are a few exceptions, and the following rules account for most of them:\n* Adjectives and nouns ending in a vowel followed by ''-le, -ne,'' or ''-re'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''fr'''a'''gile, m'''a'''rgine, '''a'''ltere'' 'other', but ''illa imp'''o'''ne'' 'she imposes').\n* Words ending in ''-ica/-ico, -ide/-ido'' and ''-ula/-ulo,'' are stressed on the third-last syllable (''pol'''i'''tica, scient'''i'''fico, r'''a'''pide, st'''u'''pido, cap'''i'''tula, s'''e'''culo'' 'century').\n* Words ending in ''-ic'' are stressed on the second-last syllable (''c'''u'''bic'').\n\nSpeakers may pronounce all words according to the general rule mentioned above. For example, ''kilom'''e'''tro'' is acceptable, although ''kil'''o'''metro'' is more common.<ref name=\"gode1955\">{{cite book|last=Gode|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Gode|author2=[[Hugh E.

However, the prototyping procedure for determining Interlingua words, which strives for internationality, should in general lead naturally to words that are easy for most learners to pronounce. In the process of forming new words, an ending cannot always be added without a modification of some kind in between. A good example is the plural ''-s'', which is always preceded by a vowel to prevent the occurrence of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end. If the singular does not end in a vowel, the final ''-s'' becomes ''-es.''{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n=== Loanwords ===\nUnassimilated foreign [[loanword]]s, or borrowed words, are pronounced as in their language of origin.<ref name=\"iala1971\"/>\n\n== Vocabulary ==\n{{See also|Free word-building in Interlingua}}\n\nWords in Interlingua may be taken from any language,<ref>Morris, Alice Vanderbilt, [http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm#factsreasoning \"IALA's system: Underlying facts and reasoning\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040702192153/http://www.interlingua.fi/ialagr45.htm |date=2004-07-02 }}, ''General report'', New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1945.</ref> as long as their internationality is verified by their presence in seven ''control'' languages: [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[French language|French]], and [[English language|English]], with [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] acting as secondary controls. These are the most widely spoken [[Romance language|Romance]], [[Germanic language|Germanic]], and [[Slavic language]]s, respectively. Because of their close relationship, Spanish and Portuguese are treated as one unit. The largest number of Interlingua words are of [[Latin language|Latin]] origin, with the [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Germanic language|Germanic]] languages providing the second and third largest number. The remainder of the vocabulary originates in [[Slavic language|Slavic]] and non-[[Indo-European languages]].<ref name=\"iala1971\"/>\n\n=== Eligibility ===\n{{Main|Interlingua and eligibility of international words}}\n\nA word, that is a form with meaning, is eligible for the Interlingua vocabulary if it is verified by at least three of the four primary control languages. Either secondary control language can substitute for a primary language. Any word of Indo-European origin found in a control language can contribute to the eligibility of an international word.<ref name=\"interlinguistic-standardization\">Stillman, E. Clark, and Gode, Alexander, ''Interlinguistic standardization'', New York: International Auxiliary Language Association, 1943. [http://www.interlingua.com/historia/publicationes/standardisation.htm Articles 82\u2013100] translated by [[Stanley A. Mulaik]]. Revised 2006.</ref> In some cases, the archaic or ''potential'' presence of a word can contribute to its eligibility.\n\nA word can be potentially present in a language when a [[Morphological derivation|derivative]] is present, but the word itself is not. English ''proximity'', for example, gives support to Interlingua ''proxime'', meaning 'near, close'. This counts as long as one or more control languages actually have this basic root word, which the Romance languages all do. Potentiality also occurs when a concept is represented as a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] or derivative in a control language, the [[morpheme]]s that make it up are themselves international, and the combination adequately conveys the meaning of the larger word. An example is Italian ''fiammifero'' (lit. flamebearer), meaning \"match, lucifer\", which leads to Interlingua ''flammifero'', or \"match\". This word is thus said to be potentially present in the other languages although they may represent the meaning with a single morpheme.<ref name=\"iala1971\"/>\n\nWords do not enter the Interlingua vocabulary solely because [[cognate]]s exist in a sufficient number of languages. If [[semantic change|their meanings have become different over time]], they are considered different words for the purpose of Interlingua eligibility. If they still have one or more meanings in common, however, the word can enter Interlingua with this smaller set of meanings.<ref name=\"interlinguistic-standardization\"/>\n\nIf this procedure did not produce an international word, the word for a concept was originally taken from Latin (see below). This only occurred with a few [[grammatical particle]]s.\n\n=== Form ===\nThe form of an Interlingua word is considered an ''international prototype'' with respect to the other words. On the one hand, it should be neutral, free from characteristics peculiar to one language. On the other hand, it should maximally capture the characteristics common to all contributing languages. As a result, it can be transformed into any of the contributing variants using only these language-specific characteristics. If the word has any derivatives that occur in the source languages with appropriate parallel meanings, then their [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] connection must remain intact; for example, the Interlingua word for 'time' is spelled ''tempore'' and not ''*tempus'' or ''*tempo'' in order to match it with its derived adjectives, such as ''temporal''.<ref>Gode, Alexander, \"Introduction\", ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language'', Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20071227020831/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-intro2.html#series#series \"Forms of international words in derivational series\"].</ref>\n\nThe language-specific characteristics are closely related to the [[sound law]]s of the individual languages; the resulting words are often close or even identical to the most recent form common to the contributing words. This sometimes corresponds with that of [[Vulgar Latin]]. At other times, it is much more recent or even contemporary. It is never older than the classical period.<ref name=\"interlinguistic-standardization\"/>\n\n=== An illustration ===\nThe French ''\u0153il'', Italian ''occhio'', Spanish ''ojo'', and Portuguese ''olho'' appear quite different, but they descend from a historical form ''oculus''. German ''Auge'', Dutch ''oog'' and English ''eye'' (cf. Czech and Polish ''oko'', Ukrainian ''\u043e\u043a\u043e'' ''(\u00f3ko)'') are related to this form in that all three descend from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ok\u02b7''. In addition, international derivatives like ''ocular'' and ''oculista'' occur in all of Interlingua's control languages.<ref name=\"blandino1989\"/> Each of these forms contributes to the eligibility of the Interlingua word.<ref name=\"interlinguistic-standardization\"/> German and English base words do not influence the form of the Interlingua word, because their Indo-European connection is considered too remote.<ref>Gode, Alexander, \"Introduction\", ''Interlingua-English: A dictionary of the international language'', Revised Edition, New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 1971. See [https://web.archive.org/web/20071227020831/http://www.bowks.net/worldlang/aux/b_IED-intro2.html#method#method \"Methods and techniques: Non-Latin examples\"].</ref> Instead, the remaining base words and especially the derivatives determine the form ''oculo'' found in Interlingua.<ref name=\"blandino1989\"/>\n\n=== Notes on Interlingua vocabulary ===\nNew words can be derived internally \u2013 that is, from existing Interlingua words \u2013 or extracted from the control languages in the manner of the original vocabulary. Internal word-building, though freer than in the control languages, is more limited than in schematic languages.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nOriginally, a word was taken from Latin if the usual procedure did not produce a sufficiently international word. More recently, modern alternatives have become generally accepted. For example, the southern Romance ''comprar'', meaning 'to buy', has replaced ''emer'', because the latter occurs only in derivatives in the control languages. Similarly, the modern form ''troppo'', 'too' or 'too much', has replaced ''nimis'', and ''ma'' 'but' has largely replaced ''sed''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n== Grammar ==\n{{Main|Interlingua grammar}}\n\nInterlingua has been developed to omit any grammatical feature that is absent from any one primary control language. Thus, Interlingua has no [[agreement (linguistics)|noun\u2013adjective agreement]] by gender, case, or number (cf. Spanish and Portuguese ''gatas negras'' or Italian ''gatte nere'', 'black female cats'), because this is absent from English, and it has no progressive verb tenses (English ''I am reading''), because they are absent from French. Conversely, Interlingua [[grammatical number|distinguishes singular nouns from plural nouns]] because all the control languages do.<ref name=\"gode1955\"/>  With respect to the secondary control languages, Interlingua has articles, unlike Russian.\n\nThe definite article ''le'' is invariable, as in English. Nouns have no [[grammatical gender]].<ref name=\"gode1955\"/><ref name=\"wilgenhof1995\">Wilgenhof, Karel. ''Grammatica de Interlingua''. Union Mundial pro Interlingua, Beekbergen, Netherlands, 1995.</ref> Plurals are formed by adding ''-s'', or ''-es'' after a final consonant.<ref name=\"gode1955\"/> [[Personal pronouns]] take one form for the subject and one for the direct object and reflexive. In the third person, the reflexive is always ''se''.<ref name=\"gode1955\"/><ref name=\"wilgenhof1995\"/> Most [[adverb]]s are derived regularly from [[adjective]]s by adding ''-mente'', or ''-amente'' after a ''-c''. An adverb can be formed from any adjective in this way.<ref>Brauers, Karl. ''Grammatica synoptic de Interlingua''. Morges, Switzerland: Editiones Interlingua, 1975.</ref>\n\nVerbs take the same form for all persons (''io vive, tu vive, illa vive'', 'I live', 'you live', 'she lives'). The [[indicative]] (''pare'', 'appear', 'appears') is the same as the [[Imperative mood|imperative]] (''pare!'' 'appear!'), and there is no [[subjunctive]].<ref name=\"gode1955\"/> Three common verbs usually take short forms in the present tense: ''es'' for 'is', 'am', 'are;' ''ha'' for 'has', 'have;' and ''va'' for 'go', 'goes'.<ref name=\"wilgenhof1995\"/> A few irregular verb forms are available, but rarely used.<ref>These are optional short forms for ''esser'', 'to be'. They are found in Wilgenhof, who stops short of calling them irregular verb forms. Two such forms appear in Gode and Blair, and one is labeled irregular; none are in Brauers.</ref>\n\nThere are four simple tenses (present, past, future, and conditional), three compound tenses (past, future, and conditional), and the passive voice. The compound structures employ an auxiliary plus the infinitive or the past participle (e.g., ''Ille ha arrivate'', 'He has arrived').<ref name=\"gode1955\"/> Simple and compound tenses can be combined in various ways to express more complex tenses (e.g., ''Nos haberea morite'', 'We would have died').<ref>See for example Gode (1955), [http://members.optus.net/~ado_hall/interlingua/gi/parts_of_speech/verb.html#115 \u00a7115, \"Table of Conjugation\"], pp. 38\u201340.</ref>\n\nWord order is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]], except that a direct object pronoun or reflexive pronoun comes before the verb (''Io les vide'', 'I see them').<ref name=\"gode1955\"/><ref name=\"wilgenhof1995\"/> Adjectives may precede or follow the nouns they modify, but they most often follow it.<ref name=\"gode1955\"/> The position of adverbs is flexible, though constrained by common sense.<ref name=\"wilgenhof1995\"/>\n\nThe grammar of Interlingua has been described as similar to that of the Romance languages, but greatly simplified, primarily under the influence of English.<ref name=\"gode1955\"/> More recently, Interlingua's grammar has been likened to the simple grammars of Japanese and particularly Chinese.<ref>Yeager, Leland B., \"Artificialitate, ethnocentrismo, e le linguas oriental: Le caso de Interlingua\", ''Interlinguistica e Interlingua: Discursos public per Ingvar Stenstrom e Leland B.

Others contend that Interlingua has spelling irregularities that, while internationally recognizable in written form, increase the time needed to fully learn the language, especially for those unfamiliar with Indo-European languages. A related point of criticism is that Interlingua's credential as being [[Standard Average European]] is too weak outside the Romance languages. Some opponents see the [[Germanic language|Germanic]], [[Slavic language|Slavic]], and [[Celtic language]]s, in particular, as having little influence.\n\nProponents{{Who|date=January 2010}} argue that Interlingua's source languages include not only Romance languages but English, German, and Russian as well. Moreover, the source languages are widely spoken internationally, and large numbers of their words also appear in other languages \u2013 still more when derivative forms and [[loan translation]]s are included. Tests had shown that if a larger number of source languages were used, the results would be about the same.<ref name=\"iala1971\"/> So, IALA selected a much simpler extraction procedure for Interlingua with little adverse effect on its internationality.\n\n== Samples ==\nFrom an essay by Alexander Gode:\n\n:''Interlingua se ha distachate ab le movimento pro le disveloppamento e le introduction de un lingua universal pro tote le humanitate. Si o non on crede que un lingua pro tote le humanitate es possibile, si o non on crede que interlingua va devenir un tal lingua es totalmente indifferente ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme. Le sol facto que importa (ab le puncto de vista de interlingua mesme) es que interlingua, gratias a su ambition de reflecter le homogeneitate cultural e ergo linguistic del occidente, es capace de render servicios tangibile a iste precise momento del historia del mundo. Il es per su contributiones actual e non per le promissas de su adherentes que interlingua vole esser judicate.''<ref>''Novas de Interlingua'', May/June 1958.</ref>\n\n:Interlingua has detached itself from the movement for the development and introduction of a universal language for all humanity. Whether or not one believes that a language for all humanity is possible, whether or not one believes that Interlingua will become such a language is totally irrelevant from the point of view of Interlingua itself. The only fact that matters (from the point of view of Interlingua itself) is that Interlingua, thanks to its ambition of reflecting the cultural and thus linguistic homogeneity of the West, is capable of rendering tangible services at this precise moment in the history of the world. It is by its present contributions and not by the promises of its adherents that Interlingua wishes to be judged.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ The [[Lord's Prayer]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | Interlingua\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[Lingua Franca Nova]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[Latino sine flexione]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[Esperanto]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[Ido (language)|Ido]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[Latin]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[Spanish language|Spanish]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[Italian language|Italian]]\n| style=\"width:10%\" | [[English language|English]] (traditional)\n|-\n|\nPatre nostre, qui es in le celos,<br />\nque tu nomine sia sanctificate;<br />\nque tu regno veni;<br />\nque tu voluntate sia facite<br />\ncomo in le celo, etiam super le terra.<br />\n|\nNos Padre, ci es en sielo,<br />\nsante es tua nome;<br />\ntua renia va veni;<br />\ntua vole va es fada<br />\nen tera como en sielo.<br />\n|\nPatre nostro, qui es in celos,<br />\nque tuo nomine fi sanctificato;<br />\nque tuo regno adveni;<br />\nque tuo voluntate es facto<br />\nsicut in celo et in terra.<br />\n|\nPatro nia, Kiu estas en la \u0109ielo,<br />\nsanktigata estu Via nomo.<br />\nVenu Via regno,<br />\nfari\u011du Via volo,<br />\nkiel en la \u0109ielo tiel anka\u016d sur la tero.<br />\n|\nPatro nia, qua esas en la cielo,<br />\ntua nomo santigesez;<br />\ntua regno advenez;<br />\ntua volo facesez quale en la cielo<br />\ntale anke sur la tero.<br />\n|\nPater noster, qui es in caelis,<br />\nsanctificetur nomen tuum.<br />\nAdveniat regnum tuum.<br />\nFiat voluntas tua,<br />\nsicut in caelo, et in terra.<br />\n|\nPadre nuestro, que est\u00e1s en los cielos,<br />\nsantificado sea tu Nombre;<br />\nvenga a nosotros tu Reino;<br />\nh\u00e1gase tu Voluntad<br />\nas\u00ed en la tierra como en el cielo.<br />\n|\nPadre nostro che sei nei cieli, <br />\nsia santificato il tuo Nome, <br />\nvenga il tuo Regno, <br />\nsia fatta la tua Volont\u00e0 <br />\ncome in cielo cos\u00ec in terra. <br />\n|\nOur Father, who art in heaven,<br />\nhallowed be thy name;<br />\nthy kingdom come,<br />\nthy will be done.<br />\non earth, as it is in heaven.<br />\n|-\n|\nDa nos hodie nostre pan quotidian,<br />\ne pardona a nos nostre debitas<br />\ncomo etiam nos los pardona a nostre debitores.<br />\nE non induce nos in tentation,<br />\nsed libera nos del mal.<br />\nAmen.\n|\nDona nosa pan dial a nos,<br />\npardona nosa pecas,<br />\ncomo nos pardona los ci peca a nos.<br />\nNo condui nos a tentia,<br />\nma proteje nos de mal.<br />\nAmen.\n|\nDa hodie ad nos nostro pane quotidiano,<br />\net remitte ad nos nostro debitos,<br />\nsicut et nos remitte ad nostro debitores.<br />\nEt non induce nos in tentatione,<br />\nsed libera nos ab malo.<br />\nAmen.\n|\nNian panon \u0109iutagan donu al ni hodia\u016d<br />\nkaj pardonu al ni niajn \u015duldojn,<br />\nkiel anka\u016d ni pardonas al niaj \u015duldantoj.<br />\nKaj ne konduku nin en tenton,<br />\nsed liberigu nin de la malbono.<br />\nAmen\n|\nDonez a ni cadie la omnadiala pano,<br />\ne pardonez a ni nia ofensi,<br />\nquale anke ni pardonas a nia ofensanti,<br />\ne ne duktez ni aden la tento,<br />\nma liberigez ni del malajo.<br />\nAmen\n|\nPanem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie,<br />\net dimitte nobis debita nostra,<br />\nsicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.<br />\nEt ne nos inducas in tentationem,<br />\nsed libera nos a malo.<br />\nAmen.\n|\nDanos hoy nuestro pan de cada d\u00eda;<br />\nperdona nuestras ofensas,<br />\nas\u00ed como nosotros perdonamos a quienes nos ofenden;<br />\ny no nos dejes caer en la tentaci\u00f3n,<br />\nmas l\u00edbranos del mal.<br />\nAmen.\n|\nDacci oggi il nostro pane quotidiano, <br />\ne rimetti a noi i nostri debiti <br />\ncome noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori, <br />\ne non ci indurre in tentazione, <br />\nma liberaci dal male. <br />\nAmen.\n|\nGive us this day our daily bread;<br />\nand forgive us our debts<br />\nas we have forgiven our debtors.<br />\nAnd lead us not into temptation,<br />\nbut deliver us from evil.<br />\nAmen.\n|}\n\n==Flags and symbols==\n[[File:Flag of Interlingua.svg|thumb|upright|Flag of Interlingua by [[Karel Podrazil]]]]\n[[File:Interlingua2.png|thumb|upright|Another flag of Interlingua]]\n\nAs with Esperanto, there have been proposals for a flag of Interlingua;<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140416192338/http://fotw.net/flags/qy-ia.html Flags of Interlingua (IALA)] from fotw.net (archived URL)</ref> the proposal by Czech translator Karel Podrazil is recognized by multilingual sites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airbagjacket.eu/jachetta_airbag.html |title=Toto super le airbag jachetta e gilet / jachetta e gilet con airbag (invento hungaro) -

From the Anglo-Saxon period Latin ''Vecta'', Old English ''Wiht'' and Old Welsh forms ''Gueid'' and ''Guith'' are recorded. In [[Domesday Book]] it is ''Wit''; the modern Welsh name is ''Ynys Wyth'' (''ynys'' = island). These are all variant forms of the same name, possibly Celtic in origin. It may mean \"place of the division\", because the island divides the two arms of the Solent.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names'', 4th ed.

Slightly more than half, mainly in the west, is designated as the [[Isle of Wight AONB|Isle of Wight Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty]].  The island has {{convert|258|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of farmland, {{convert|52|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of developed areas, and {{convert|57|mi}} of coastline. Its landscapes are diverse, leading to its oft-quoted description as \"England in miniature\".\n\nWest Wight is predominantly rural, with dramatic coastlines dominated by the [[chalk]] [[downland]] ridge, running across the whole island and ending in [[the Needles]] stacks.  The southwestern quarter is commonly referred to as the [[Back of the Wight]], and has a unique character. The highest point on the island is [[St Boniface Down]] in the south east, which at {{convert|241|m|ft|order=flip}} is a [[Marilyn (hill)|marilyn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=9547|title=St Boniface Down, England |author=Staff writer(s); no by-line| date=1987\u20132012| publisher=Peakbagger.com |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> The most notable habitats on the rest of the island are probably the soft cliffs and sea ledges, which are scenic features, important for wildlife, and internationally protected.\n\nThe island has three principal rivers. The [[River Medina]] flows north into the [[Solent]], the [[Eastern Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Eastern Yar]] flows roughly northeast to [[Bembridge]] Harbour, and the [[Western Yar (river), Isle of Wight|Western Yar]] flows the short distance from [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater Bay]] to a relatively large estuary at [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight|Yarmouth]].  Without human intervention the sea might well have split the island into three: at the west end where a bank of pebbles separates [[Freshwater, Isle of Wight|Freshwater Bay]] from the [[marsh]]y backwaters of the Western Yar east of Freshwater, and at the east end where a thin strip of land separates Sandown Bay from the marshy Eastern Yar basin.\n\nThe [[Undercliff]] between St Catherine's Point and [[Bonchurch]] is the largest area of landslip morphology in western Europe.\n\nThe north coast is unusual in having four high tides each day, with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours.  This arises because the western Solent is narrower than the eastern; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around the south of the island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water.<ref>{{cite book | title=Isle of Wight: A Miscellany | author=Julia Skinner | publisher=www.francisfrith.com | date=2012 |isbn=978-1-84589-683-6}}</ref>\n\n==Geology==\n{{main article|Geology of the Isle of Wight}}\n\nThe Isle of Wight is made up of a variety of rock types dating from early [[Cretaceous]] (around 127&nbsp;million years ago) to the middle of the [[Palaeogene]] (around 30&nbsp;million years ago). The geological structure is dominated by a large [[monocline]] which causes a marked change in age of strata from the northern younger [[Tertiary]] beds to the older Cretaceous beds of the south. This gives rise to a [[Strike and dip|dip]] of almost 90 degrees in the chalk beds, seen best at [[the Needles]].\n\nThe northern half of the island is mainly composed of [[clay]]s, with the southern half formed of the [[chalk]] of the central east\u2013west downs, as well as Upper and Lower [[Greensand]]s and [[Wealden]] strata.<ref name=\"Hopson\">{{cite journal | url=http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/15996/1/Hopson_IoW_Geo_History_PGEOLA-D-11-00048R1.pdf | title=The geological history of the Isle of Wight: an overview of the 'diamond in Britain's geological crown' | author=Hopson P. | journal=Proceedings of the Geologists' Association | year=2011 | volume=122 | issue=5 | pages=745\u2013763 | doi=10.1016/j.pgeola.2011.09.007}}</ref> These strata continue west from the island across the [[Solent]] into [[Dorset]], forming the basin of [[Poole Harbour]] (Tertiary) and the [[Isle of Purbeck]] (Cretaceous) respectively. The chalky ridges of Wight and Purbeck were a single formation before they were breached by waters from the [[River Frome, Dorset|River Frome]] during the [[last glacial period|last ice age]], forming the Solent and turning Wight into an island. [[The Needles]], along with [[Old Harry Rocks]] on Purbeck, represent the edges of this breach.\n\nAll the rocks found on the island are [[sedimentary]], such as [[limestone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and [[sandstone]]s. They are rich in fossils; many can be seen exposed on beaches as the cliffs erode. [[Lignite|Lignitic coal]] is present in small quantities within seams, and can be seen on the cliffs and shore at [[Whitecliff Bay]]. Fossilised [[mollusc]]s have been found there, and also on the northern coast along with [[fossil]]ised [[crocodile]]s, [[turtle]]s and [[mammal]] bones; the youngest date back to around 30&nbsp;million years ago.\n\nThe island is one of the most important areas in Europe for [[dinosaur]] [[fossil]]s. The [[Erosion|eroding]] cliffs often reveal previously hidden remains, particularly along the [[Back of the Wight]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redfunnel.co.uk/island-guide/isle-of-wight-activities/fossil-and-dinosaur-hunting/ |title=Fossil and Dinosaur Hunting|publisher=redfunnel.co.uk |accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref> [[Dinosaur]] bones and [[ichnite|fossilised footprints]] can be seen in and on the rocks exposed around the island's beaches, especially at [[Yaverland]] and [[Compton Bay]]. As a result, the island has been nicknamed \"Dinosaur Island\" and [[Dinosaur Isle]] was established in 2001.\n\nThe area was affected by sea level changes during the repeated [[Quaternary]] glaciations.

The island has a warmer climate and a longer growing season than much of the United Kingdom. [[Garlic]] has been successfully grown in [[Newchurch, Isle of Wight|Newchurch]] for many years, and is even exported to France.

It is used by [[network device]]s, including [[Router (computing)|routers]], to send error messages and operational information indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a [[host (network)|host]] or router could not be reached.<ref name=\"Forouzan\">{{cite book | author=Forouzan, Behrouz A. | title=Data Communications And Networking | edition=Fourth | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=Boston | year=2007 |pages=621\u2013630 | isbn=0-07-296775-7 }}</ref> ICMP differs from [[transport protocol]]s such as [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] in that it is not typically used to exchange data between systems, nor is it regularly employed by end-user network applications (with the exception of some diagnostic tools like [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] and [[traceroute]]).\n\nICMP for [[IPv4]] is defined in RFC 792.\n\n{{IPstack}}\n\n== Technical details ==\nICMP is part of the Internet protocol suite as defined in RFC 792. ICMP messages are typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in [[Internet Protocol|IP]] operations (as specified in RFC 1122). ICMP errors are directed to the source IP address of the originating packet.<ref name=\"Forouzan\" /> \n\nFor example, every device (such as an intermediate [[Router (computing)|router]]) forwarding an IP [[datagram]] first decrements the [[time to live]] (TTL) field in the IP header by one. If the resulting TTL is 0, the packet is discarded and an ICMP [[#Time exceeded|time exceeded in transit]] message is sent to the datagram's source address.\n\nMany commonly used network utilities are based on ICMP messages. The [[traceroute]] command can be implemented by transmitting IP datagrams with specially set IP TTL header fields, and looking for ICMP time exceeded in transit and [[#Destination unreachable|Destination unreachable]] messages generated in response. The related [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]] utility is implemented using the ICMP ''echo request'' and ''echo reply'' messages.\n\nICMP uses the basic support of IP as if it were a higher level protocol, however, ICMP is actually an integral part of IP. Although ICMP messages are contained within standard IP packets, ICMP messages are usually processed as a special case, distinguished from normal IP processing. In many cases, it is necessary to inspect the contents of the ICMP message and deliver the appropriate error message to the application responsible for transmission of the IP packet that prompted the sending of the ICMP message.\n\nICMP is a [[network layer]] protocol. There is no TCP or UDP port number associated with ICMP packets as these numbers are associated with the [[transport layer]] above.<ref>{{Cite web | title = The OSI Model's Seven Layers Defined and Functions Explained | work = Microsoft Support | accessdate = 2014-12-28 | url = https://support.microsoft.com/kb/103884}}</ref>\n\n==Datagram structure==\nThe ICMP packet is encapsulated in an IPv4 packet.<ref name=\"Forouzan\" /> The packet consists of header and data sections.\n\n===Header===\nThe ICMP header starts after the [[IPv4#Header|IPv4 header]] and is identified by [[List of IP protocol numbers|IP protocol number]] '1'.<ref>{{cite web|title=Protocol Numbers|url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xml|publisher=Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref> All ICMP packets have an 8-byte header and variable-sized data section.

messages sent to a router or host. This message may be generated if a router or host does not have sufficient buffer space to process the request, or may occur if the router or host buffer is approaching its limit.\n\nData is sent at a very high speed from a host or from several hosts at the same time to a particular router on a network. Although a router has buffering capabilities, the buffering is limited to within a specified range. The router cannot queue any more data than the capacity of the limited buffering space. Thus if the queue gets filled up, incoming data is discarded until the queue is no longer full. But as no acknowledgement mechanism is present in the network layer, the client does not know whether the data has reached the destination successfully. Hence some remedial measures should be taken by the network layer to avoid these kind of situations. These measures are referred to as source quench. In a source quench mechanism, the router sees that the incoming data rate is much faster than the outgoing data rate, and sends an ICMP message to the clients, informing them that they should slow down their data transfer speeds or wait for a certain amount of time before attempting to send more data. When a client receives this message, it will automatically slow down the outgoing data rate or wait for a sufficient amount of time, which enables the router to empty the queue. Thus the source quench ICMP message acts as flow control in the network layer.\n\nSince research suggested that \"ICMP Source Quench [was] an ineffective (and unfair) antidote for congestion\",<ref>{{IETF RFC|6633}}</ref> routers' creation of source quench messages was deprecated in 1995 by RFC 1812. Furthermore, forwarding of and any kind of reaction to (flow control actions) source quench messages was deprecated from 2012 by RFC 6633.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Source quench message<ref name=rfc792/>{{rp|9}}\n! 00 || 01 || 02 || 03 || 04 || 05 || 06 || 07\n! 08 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15\n! 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 || 21 || 22 || 23\n! 24 || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 || 30 || 31\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| colspan=\"8\"| Type = 4\n| colspan=\"8\"| Code = 0\n| colspan=\"16\"| Header checksum\n|-\n| colspan=\"32\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| unused\n|-\n| colspan=\"32\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| IP header and first 8 bytes of original datagram's data\n|}\n\nWhere:\n:'''Type''' must be set to 4\n:'''Code''' must be set to 0\n:'''IP header''' and additional data is used by the sender to match the reply with the associated request\n\n===Redirect===\n''Redirect'' requests data packets be sent on an alternative route. ICMP Redirect is a mechanism for routers to convey routing information to hosts. The message informs a host to update its routing information (to send packets on an alternative route). If a host tries to send data through a [[Router (computing)|router]] (R1) and R1 sends the data on another router (R2) and a direct path from the host to R2 is available (that is, the host and R2 are on the same Ethernet segment), then R1 will send a redirect message to inform the host that the best route for the destination is via R2. The host should then send packets for the destination directly to R2. The router will still send the original [[datagram]] to the intended destination.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/tech/tk365/technologies_tech_note09186a0080094702.shtml |title=When Are ICMP Redirects Sent? |publisher=[[Cisco Systems]] |date=2008-06-28 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}</ref> However, if the datagram contains routing information, this message will not be sent even if a better route is available.

Let (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub> be a [[indexed family|family]] of groups and suppose we have a family of homomorphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>: ''A''<sub>''j''</sub> \u2192 ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> for all ''i'' \u2264 ''j'' (note the order), called bonding maps, with the following properties:\n# ''f''<sub>''ii''</sub> is the identity on ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>,\n# ''f''<sub>''ik''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> <small>o</small> ''f''<sub>''jk''</sub> for all ''i'' \u2264 ''j'' \u2264 ''k''.\nThen the pair ((''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub>, (''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>''i''\u2264 ''j''\u2208''I''</sub>) is called an inverse system of groups and morphisms over ''I'', and the morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> are called the transition morphisms of the system.\n\nWe define the '''inverse limit''' of the inverse system ((''A''<sub>''i''</sub>)<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub>, (''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>''i''\u2264 ''j''\u2208''I''</sub>) as a particular [[subgroup]] of the [[direct product]] of the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>'s:\n\n:<math>A = \\varprojlim_{i\\in I}{A_i} = \\left\\{\\left.\\vec a \\in \\prod_{i\\in I}A_i \\;\\right|\\; a_i = f_{ij}(a_j) \\text{ for all } i \\leq j \\text{ in } I\\right\\}.</math>\n\nThe inverse limit ''A'' comes equipped with ''natural projections'' \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub>: ''A'' \u2192 ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> which pick out the ''i''th component of the direct product for each ''i'' in ''I''. The inverse limit and the natural projections satisfy a [[universal property]] described in the next section.\n\nThis same construction may be carried out if the ''A''<sub>''i''</sub>'s are [[Set (mathematics)|sets]],<ref name=\"same-construction\">John Rhodes & Benjamin Steinberg. The q-theory of Finite Semigroups. p. 133. {{ISBN|978-0-387-09780-0}}.</ref> semigroups,<ref name=\"same-construction\"/> topological spaces,<ref name=\"same-construction\"/> [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[module (mathematics)|modules]] (over a fixed ring), [[algebra over a field|algebras]] (over a fixed ring), etc., and the [[homomorphism]]s are morphisms in the corresponding [[category theory|category]]. The inverse limit will also belong to that category.\n\n=== General definition ===\n\nThe inverse limit can be defined abstractly in an arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|category]] by means of a [[universal property]]. Let (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) be an inverse system of objects and [[morphism]]s  in a category ''C'' (same definition as above). The '''inverse limit''' of this system is an object ''X'' in ''C'' together with morphisms \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub>: ''X'' \u2192 ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> (called ''projections'') satisfying \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> <small>o</small> \u03c0<sub>''j''</sub> for all ''i'' \u2264 ''j''. The pair (''X'', \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub>)  must be universal in the sense that for any other such pair (''Y'', \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>)  (i.e. \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub>: ''Y'' \u2192 ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> with \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> = ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> <small>o</small> \u03c8<sub>''j''</sub> for all ''i'' \u2264 ''j'') there exists a unique morphism ''u'': ''Y'' \u2192 ''X'' such that the diagram\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">[[Image:InverseLimit-01.png]]</div>\n\n[[commutative diagram|commutes]] for all ''i'' \u2264 ''j'', for which it suffices to show that \u03c8<sub>''i''</sub> = \u03c0<sub>''i''</sub> <small>o</small> ''u'' for all ''i''. The inverse limit is often denoted\n:<math>X = \\varprojlim X_i</math>\nwith the inverse system (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) being understood.\n\nIn some categories, the inverse limit does not exist. If it does, however, it is unique in a strong sense: given any other inverse limit ''X''&prime; there exists a ''unique'' [[isomorphism]] ''X''&prime; \u2192 ''X'' commuting with the projection maps.\n\nWe note that an inverse system in a category ''C'' admits an alternative description in terms of [[functor]]s. Any partially ordered set ''I'' can be considered as a [[small category]] where the morphisms consist of arrows ''i'' \u2192 ''j'' [[if and only if]] ''i'' \u2264 ''j''. An inverse system is then just a [[contravariant functor]] ''I'' \u2192 ''C'', and the inverse limit functor\n<math>\\varprojlim:C^{I^{op}}\\rightarrow C</math> is a [[covariant functor]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* The ring of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic integers]] is the inverse limit of the rings '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''n''</sup>'''Z''' (see [[modular arithmetic]]) with the index set being the [[natural number]]s with the usual order, and the morphisms being \"take remainder\". That is, one considers sequences of integers <math>(n_0, n_1, \\cdots)</math> such that each element of the sequence \"projects\" down to the previous ones, namely, that <math>n_i\\equiv n_j \\mbox{ mod } p^{i+1}</math> whenever <math>i<j.</math> The natural topology on the ''p''-adic integers is the one implied here, namely the [[product topology]] with [[cylinder set]]s as the open sets.\n* The ring <math>\\textstyle R[[t]]</math> of [[formal power series]] over a commutative ring ''R'' can be thought of as the inverse limit of the rings <math>\\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]</math>, indexed by the natural numbers as usually ordered, with the morphisms from <math>\\textstyle R[t]/t^{n+j}R[t]</math> to <math>\\textstyle R[t]/t^nR[t]</math> given by the natural projection.\n* [[Pro-finite group]]s are defined as inverse limits of (discrete) finite groups.\n* Let the index set ''I'' of an inverse system (''X''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) have a [[greatest element]] ''m''. Then the natural projection \u03c0<sub>''m''</sub>: ''X'' \u2192 ''X''<sub>''m''</sub> is an isomorphism.\n* Inverse limits in the [[category of topological spaces]] are given by placing the [[initial topology]] on the underlying set-theoretic inverse limit.  This is known as the '''limit topology'''.\n** The set of infinite [[String (computer science)|strings]] is the inverse limit of the set of finite strings, and is thus endowed with the limit topology. As the original spaces are [[discrete topology|discrete]], the limit space is [[totally disconnected]]. This is one way of realizing the [[p-adic|''p''-adic numbers]] and the [[Cantor set]] (as infinite strings).\n* Let (''I'', =) be the trivial order (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is just the [[product (category theory)|product]].\n* Let ''I'' consist of three elements ''i'', ''j'', and ''k'' with ''i'' \u2264 ''j'' and ''i'' \u2264 ''k'' (not directed). The inverse limit of any corresponding inverse system is the [[pullback (category theory)|pullback]].\n\n==Derived functors of the inverse limit==\n\nFor an [[abelian category]] ''C'', the inverse limit functor\n:<math>\\varprojlim:C^I\\rightarrow C</math>\nis [[Exact functor|left exact]]. If ''I'' is ordered (not simply partially ordered) and [[countable]], and ''C'' is the category '''Ab''' of abelian groups, the Mittag-Leffler condition is a condition on the transition morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> that ensures the exactness of <math>\\varprojlim</math>. Specifically, [[Samuel Eilenberg|Eilenberg]] constructed a functor\n:<math>\\varprojlim{}^1:\\operatorname{Ab}^I\\rightarrow\\operatorname{Ab}</math>\n(pronounced \"lim one\") such that if (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>), (''B''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''g''<sub>''ij''</sub>), and (''C''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''h''<sub>''ij''</sub>) are three projective systems of abelian groups, and\n:<math>0\\rightarrow A_i\\rightarrow B_i\\rightarrow C_i\\rightarrow0</math>\nis a [[short exact sequence]] of inverse systems, then\n:<math>0\\rightarrow\\varprojlim A_i\\rightarrow\\varprojlim B_i\\rightarrow\\varprojlim C_i\\rightarrow\\varprojlim{}^1A_i</math>\nis an exact sequence in '''Ab'''.\n\n===Mittag-Leffler condition===\n\nIf the ranges of the morphisms of an inverse system of abelian groups (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) are ''stationary'', that is, for every ''k'' there exists ''j'' \u2265 ''k'' such that for all ''i'' \u2265 ''j'' :<math> f_{kj}(A_j)=f_{ki}(A_i)</math> one says that the system satisfies the '''Mittag-Leffler condition'''.\n\nThe name \"Mittag-Leffler\" for this condition was given by Bourbaki in their chapter on uniform structures for a similar result about inverse limits of complete Hausdorff uniform spaces. Mittag-Leffler used a similar argument in the proof of [[Mittag-Leffler's theorem]].\n\nThe following situations are examples where the Mittag-Leffler condition is satisfied: \n* a system in which the morphisms ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub> are surjective\n* a system of finite-dimensional vector spaces or finite abelian groups or modules of finite length or Artinian modules.\n\nAn example where <math>\\varprojlim{}^1</math> is non-zero is obtained by taking ''I'' to be the non-negative [[integer]]s, letting ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''p''<sup>''i''</sup>'''Z''', ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> = '''Z''', and ''C''<sub>''i''</sub> = ''B''<sub>''i''</sub> / ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = '''Z'''/''p''<sup>''i''</sup>'''Z'''. Then\n:<math>\\varprojlim{}^1A_i=\\mathbf{Z}_p/\\mathbf{Z}</math>\nwhere '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub> denotes the [[p-adic integers]].\n\n===Further results===\n\nMore generally, if ''C'' is an arbitrary abelian category that has [[Injective object#Enough injectives|enough injectives]], then so does ''C''<sup>''I''</sup>, and the right [[derived functors]] of the inverse limit functor can thus be defined. The ''n''th right derived functor is denoted\n:<math>R^n\\varprojlim:C^I\\rightarrow C.</math>\nIn the case where ''C'' satisfies [[Grothendieck]]'s axiom [[Abelian category#Grothendieck's axioms|(AB4*)]], [[Jan-Erik Roos]] generalized the functor lim<sup>1</sup> on '''Ab'''<sup>''I''</sup> to series of functors lim<sup>n</sup> such that\n:<math>\\varprojlim{}^n\\cong R^n\\varprojlim.</math>\nIt was thought for almost 40 years that Roos had proved (in ''Sur les foncteurs d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de lim. Applications. '') that lim<sup>1</sup> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 for (''A''<sub>''i''</sub>, ''f''<sub>''ij''</sub>) an inverse system with surjective transition morphisms and ''I'' the set of non-negative integers (such inverse systems are often called \"[[Mittag-Leffler]] sequences\"). However, in 2002, [[Amnon Neeman]] and [[Pierre Deligne]] constructed an example of such a system in a category satisfying (AB4) (in addition to (AB4*)) with lim<sup>1</sup> ''A''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2260 0. Roos has since shown (in \"Derived functors of inverse limits revisited\") that his result is correct if ''C'' has a set of generators (in addition to satisfying (AB3) and (AB4*)).\n\n[[Barry Mitchell (mathematician)|Barry Mitchell]] has shown (in \"The cohomological dimension of a directed set\") that if ''I'' has [[cardinality]] <math>\\aleph_d</math> (the ''d''th [[Aleph number|infinite cardinal]]), then ''R''<sup>''n''</sup>lim is zero for all ''n'' \u2265 ''d'' + 2. This applies to the ''I''-indexed diagrams in the category of ''R''-modules, with ''R'' a commutative ring; it is not necessarily true in an arbitrary abelian category (see Roos' \"Derived functors of inverse limits revisited\" for examples of abelian categories in which lim<sup>''n''</sup>, on diagrams indexed by a countable set, is nonzero for&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1).\n\n== Related concepts and generalizations ==\n\nThe [[dual (category theory)|categorical dual]] of an inverse limit is a [[direct limit]] (or inductive limit). More general concepts are the [[limit (category theory)|limits and colimits]] of category theory. The terminology is somewhat confusing: inverse limits are limits, while direct limits are colimits.\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Direct limit|Direct, or inductive limit]]\n* [[Protorus]]\n\n== Notes ==\n<references />\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first=Nicolas|last=Bourbaki|authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=Algebra I|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=978-3-540-64243-5|oclc=40551484}}\n*{{citation|first=Nicolas|last=Bourbaki|authorlink=Nicolas Bourbaki|title=General topology: Chapters 1-4|publisher=Springer|year=1989|isbn=978-3-540-64241-1|oclc=40551485}}\n*{{citation|first=Saunders |last=Mac Lane |authorlink=Saunders Mac Lane|title=[[Categories for the Working Mathematician]] | edition=2nd |date=September 1998 |publisher=Springer|isbn=0-387-98403-8}}\n*{{Citation | last=Mitchell | first=Barry | author-link=Barry Mitchell (mathematician) | title=Rings with several objects | journal=[[Advances in Mathematics]] | mr=0294454  | year=1972 | volume=8 | pages=1\u2013161 | doi=10.1016/0001-8708(72)90002-3}}\n*{{Citation | last=Neeman | first=Amnon | author-link=Amnon Neeman | title=A counterexample to a 1961 \"theorem\" in homological algebra (with appendix by Pierre Deligne) | journal=[[Inventiones Mathematicae]] | mr=1906154  | year=2002 | volume=148 | issue=2 | pages=397\u2013420 | doi=10.1007/s002220100197}}\n*{{Citation | last=Roos | first=Jan-Erik | author-link=Jan-Erik Roos | title=Sur les foncteurs d\u00e9riv\u00e9s de lim.

The most distant spacecraft, [[Voyager 1]], has left the Solar System, while [[Pioneer 10]], [[Pioneer 11]], [[Voyager 2]] and [[New Horizons]] are on course to leave it.<ref>{{cite web|title=NASA Spacecraft Embarks on Historic Journey Into Interstellar Space|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-277|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn general, planetary orbiters and landers return much more detailed and comprehensive information than fly-by missions.  Space probes have been placed into orbit around all the five planets known to the ancients:  first [[Mars]] ([[Mariner 9]], 1971), then [[Venus]] ([[Venera 9]], 1975; but landings on Venus and atmospheric probes were performed even earlier), [[Jupiter]] ([[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]], 1995), [[Saturn]] ([[Cassini/Huygens]], 2004), and most recently [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] ([[MESSENGER]], March 2011), and have returned data about these bodies and their [[natural satellite]]s.\n\nThe [[NEAR Shoemaker]] mission in 2000 orbited the large near-Earth asteroid [[433 Eros]], and was even successfully landed there, though it had not been designed with this maneuver in mind.  The Japanese [[ion drive|ion-drive]] spacecraft [[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]] in 2005 also orbited the small [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[25143 Itokawa]], landing on it briefly and returning grains of its surface material to Earth.  Another powerful ion-drive mission, [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], has orbited the large asteroid [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (July 2011 \u2013 September 2012) and later moved on to the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], arriving in March 2015.\n\nRemotely controlled landers such as [[Viking program|Viking]], [[Mars Pathfinder|Pathfinder]] and the two [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s have landed on the surface of Mars and several [[Venera]] and [[Vega program|Vega]] spacecraft have landed on the surface of Venus. The [[Huygens probe]] successfully landed on Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]].\n\nNo manned missions have been sent to any planet of the Solar System. [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]], however, landed twelve people on the [[Moon]] and returned them to [[Earth]].  The American [[Vision for Space Exploration]], originally introduced by President [[George W. Bush]] and put into practice through the [[Constellation program]], had as a long-term goal to eventually send human astronauts to Mars. However, on February 1, 2010, President Barack Obama proposed cancelling the program in Fiscal Year 2011.  An earlier project which received some significant planning by NASA included a manned fly-by of Venus in the [[Manned Venus Flyby]] mission, but was cancelled when the [[Apollo Applications Program]] was terminated due to NASA budget cuts in the late 1960s.\n\n==Reasons for interplanetary travel==\n[[File:Spacecolony3.jpeg|thumb|Space colony]]\nThe costs and risk of interplanetary travel receive a lot of publicity \u2014 spectacular examples include the malfunctions or complete failures of unmanned probes such as [[Mars 96]], [[Deep Space 2]] and [[Beagle 2]] (the article [[List of Solar System probes]] gives a full list).\n\nMany astronomers, geologists and biologists believe that exploration of the Solar System provides knowledge that could not be gained by observations from Earth's surface or from orbit around Earth. But they disagree about whether manned missions make a useful scientific contribution \u2014 some think robotic probes are cheaper and safer, while others argue that either astronauts advised by Earth-based scientists, or spacefaring scientists advised by Earth-based scientists, can respond more flexibly and intelligently to new or unexpected features of the region they are exploring.<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/~iac/spaceflight.html | title=The Scientific Case for Human Spaceflight | last=Crawford | first=I.A. | date=1998 | journal=Astronomy and Geophysics | pages=14\u201317 }}</ref>\n\nThose who pay for such missions (primarily in the public sector) are more likely to be interested in benefits for themselves or for the human race as a whole. So far the only benefits of this type have been \"spin-off\" technologies which were developed for space missions and then were found to be at least as useful in other activities ([http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/ NASA] publicizes spin-offs from its activities).\n\nOther practical motivations for interplanetary travel are more speculative, because our current technologies are not yet advanced enough to support test projects. But [[science fiction]] writers have a fairly good track record in predicting future technologies \u2014 for example [[Geosynchronous orbit|geosynchronous communications satellites]] ([[Arthur C. Clarke]]) and many aspects of computer technology ([[Mack Reynolds]]).\n\nMany science fiction stories (notably [[Ben Bova]]'s [[Grand Tour (novel series)|Grand Tour]] stories) feature detailed descriptions of how people could extract minerals from [[asteroid]]s and energy from sources including orbital [[Photovoltaic module|solar panel]]s (unhampered by clouds) and the very strong [[magnetic field]] of Jupiter. Some point out that such techniques may be the only way to provide rising standards of living without being stopped by pollution or by depletion of Earth's resources (for example [[peak oil]]).\n\nFinally, colonizing other parts of the Solar System would prevent the whole human species from being exterminated by any one of a number of possible events (see [[Human extinction]]).  One of these possible events is an [[asteroid impact]] like the one which may have resulted in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event]]. Although various [[Spaceguard]] projects monitor the Solar System for objects that might come dangerously close to Earth, current [[asteroid deflection strategies]] are crude and untested. To make the task more difficult, [[carbonaceous chondrite]]s are rather sooty and therefore very hard to detect. Although carbonaceous chondrites are thought to be rare, some are very large and the suspected \"[[Chicxulub Crater|dinosaur-killer]]\" may have been a carbonaceous chondrite.\n\nSome scientists, including members of the [[Space Studies Institute]], argue that the vast majority of mankind eventually will live in space and will benefit from doing this.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ssi.org/?page_id=2 | title=A Space Roadmap: Mine the Sky, Defend the Earth, Settle the Universe | last=Valentine | first=L | date=2002 | publisher=Space Studies Institute, Princeton | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223030553/http://ssi.org/?page_id=2 | archivedate=2007-02-23 | df= }}</ref>\n\n==Economical travel techniques==\nOne of the main challenges in interplanetary travel is producing the very large velocity changes necessary to travel from one body to another in the Solar System.\n\nDue to the Sun's gravitational pull, a spacecraft moving farther from the Sun will slow down, while a spacecraft moving closer will speed up. Also, since any two planets are at different distances from the Sun, the planet from which the spacecraft starts is moving around the Sun at a different speed than the planet to which the spacecraft is travelling (in accordance with [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's Third Law]]). Because of these facts, a spacecraft desiring to transfer to a planet closer to the Sun must decrease its speed with respect to the Sun by a large amount in order to intercept it, while a spacecraft traveling to a planet farther out from the Sun must increase its speed substantially.<ref name=curtisbook>{{cite book |last=Curtis |first=Howard |date=2005 |title=[[Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students]] |edition=1st |publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=0750661690 |page=257}}</ref> Then, if additionally the spacecraft wishes to enter into orbit around the destination planet (instead of just flying by it), it must match the planet's orbital speed around the Sun, usually requiring another large velocity change.\n\nSimply doing this by brute force \u2013 accelerating in the shortest route to the destination and then matching the planet's speed \u2013 would require an extremely large amount of fuel. And the fuel required for producing these velocity changes has to be launched along with the payload, and therefore even more fuel is needed to put both the spacecraft and the fuel required for its interplanetary journey into orbit. Thus, several techniques have been devised to reduce the fuel requirements of interplanetary travel.\n\nAs an example of the velocity changes involved, a spacecraft travelling from low Earth orbit to Mars using a simple trajectory must first undergo a change in speed (also known as a [[delta-v]]), in this case an increase, of about 3.8&nbsp;km/s. Then, after intercepting Mars, it must change its speed by another 2.3&nbsp;km/s in order to match Mars' orbital speed around the Sun and enter an orbit around it.<ref name=marsdeltavs>{{cite web|title=Rockets and Space Transportation |url=http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |accessdate=June 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701211813/http://www.pma.caltech.edu/~chirata/deltav.html |archivedate=July 1, 2007 }}</ref> For comparison, launching a spacecraft into low Earth orbit requires a change in speed of about 9.5&nbsp;km/s.\n\n===Hohmann transfers===\n[[File:Hohmann transfer orbit2.svg|frame|right|Hohmann Transfer Orbit: a spaceship leaves from point 2 in Earth's orbit and arrives at point 3 in Mars' (not to scale)]]\nFor many years economical interplanetary travel meant using the [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]. Hohmann demonstrated that the lowest energy route between any two orbits is an [[ellipse|elliptical]] \"orbit\" which forms a [[tangent]] to the starting and destination orbits. Once the spacecraft arrives, a second application of thrust will re-circularize the orbit at the new location. In the case of planetary transfers this means directing the spacecraft, originally in an orbit almost identical to Earth's, so that the [[aphelion]] of the transfer orbit is on the far side of the Sun near the orbit of the other planet. A spacecraft traveling from Earth to Mars via this method will arrive near Mars orbit in approximately 8.5 months, but because the orbital velocity is greater when closer to the center of mass (i.e. the Sun) and slower when farther from the center, the spacecraft will be traveling quite slowly and a small application of thrust is all that is needed to put it into a circular orbit around Mars. If the manoeuver is timed properly, Mars will be \"arriving\" under the spacecraft when this happens.\n\nThe Hohmann transfer applies to any two orbits, not just those with planets involved. For instance it is the most common way to transfer satellites into [[geostationary orbit]], after first being \"parked\" in [[low Earth orbit]]. However, the Hohmann transfer takes an amount of time similar to \u00bd of the orbital period of the outer orbit, so in the case of the outer planets this is many years \u2013 too long to wait. It is also based on the assumption that the points at both ends are massless, as in the case when transferring between two orbits around Earth for instance. With a planet at the destination end of the transfer, calculations become considerably more difficult.\n\n===Gravitational slingshot===\n{{main|gravitational slingshot}}\n[[File:Gravitational slingshot.svg|thumb|200px|left|Simplified example of a gravitational slingshot: the spacecraft's velocity changes by up to twice the planet's velocity]]\n[[File:Voyager 2 velocity vs distance from sun.svg|thumb|right|Plot of Voyager 2's heliocentric velocity against its distance from the Sun, illustrating the use of gravity assist to accelerate the spacecraft by Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.

The Environment of Space |publisher=.jpl.nasa.gov |date=2004-09-15 |accessdate=2016-06-26}}</ref>]]\nThe gravitational slingshot technique uses the [[gravity]] of planets and moons to change the speed and direction of a spacecraft without using fuel. In typical example, a spacecraft is sent to a distant planet on a path that is much faster than what the Hohmann transfer would call for. This would typically mean that it would arrive at the planet's orbit and continue past it. However, if there is a planet between the departure point and the target, it can be used to bend the path toward the target, and in many cases the overall travel time is greatly reduced. A prime example of this are the two crafts of the [[Voyager program]], which used slingshot effects to change trajectories several times in the outer Solar System. It is difficult to use this method for journeys in the inner part of the Solar System, although it is possible to use other nearby planets such as Venus or even the [[Moon]] as slingshots in journeys to the outer planets.\n\nThis maneuver can only change an object's velocity relative to a third, uninvolved object, \u2013 possibly the \u201ccentre of mass\u201d or the Sun. There is no change in the velocities of the two objects involved in the maneuver relative to each other.  The Sun cannot be used in a gravitational slingshot because it is stationary compared to rest of the Solar System, which orbits the Sun.  It may be used to send a spaceship or probe into the galaxy because the Sun revolves around the center of the Milky Way.\n\n===Powered slingshot===\n{{main|oberth effect}}\nA powered slingshot is the use of a rocket engine at or around closest approach to a body ([[periapsis]]). The use at this point multiplies up the effect of the delta-v, and gives a bigger effect than at other times.\n\n===Fuzzy orbits===\nComputers did not exist when [[Hohmann transfer orbit]]s were first proposed (1925) and were slow, expensive and unreliable when [[gravitational slingshot]]s were developed (1959). Recent advances in [[computing]] have made it possible to exploit many more features of the gravity fields of astronomical bodies and thus calculate even [[Low energy transfer|lower-cost trajectories]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://discovermagazine.com/1994/sep/gravitysrim419/article_view?b_start:int=1&-C= | title= Gravity's Rim | publisher=discovermagazine.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Belbruno |first=E. |date=2004 |url=http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7687.html |title=Capture Dynamics and Chaotic Motions in Celestial Mechanics: With the Construction of Low Energy Transfers |publisher=Princeton University Press |location= |isbn=9780691094809 }}</ref> Paths have been calculated which link the [[Lagrange points]] of the various planets into the so-called [[Interplanetary Transport Network]]. Such \"fuzzy orbits\" use significantly less energy than Hohmann transfers but are much, much slower. They aren't practical for manned missions because they generally take years or decades, but may be useful for high-volume transport of low-value [[commodity|commodities]] if humanity develops a space-based economy.\n\n===Aerobraking===\n[[File:Apollo cm.jpg|thumb|Apollo Command Module flying at a high [[angle of attack]] to aerobrake by skimming the atmosphere (artistic rendition)]]\n[[Aerobraking]] uses the [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmosphere]] of the target planet to slow down. It was first used on the [[Apollo program]] where the returning spacecraft did not enter Earth orbit\nbut instead used a S-shaped vertical descent profile (starting with an initially steep descent, followed by a leveling out, followed by a slight climb, followed by a return to a positive rate of descent continuing to splash-down in the ocean) through Earth's atmosphere to reduce its speed until the parachute system could be deployed enabling a safe landing. Aerobraking does not require a thick atmosphere \u2013 for example most Mars landers use the technique, and [[Mars#Atmosphere|Mars' atmosphere]] is only about 1% as thick as Earth's.\n\nAerobraking converts the spacecraft's [[kinetic energy]] into heat, so it requires a [[heatshield]] to prevent the craft from burning up. As a result, aerobraking is only helpful in cases where the fuel needed to transport the heatshield to the planet is less than the fuel that would be required to brake an unshielded craft by firing its engines. This can be addressed by creating heatshields from material available near the target<ref>https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/744615main_2011-Hogue-Final-Report.pdf</ref>\n\n==Improved technologies and methodologies==\nSeveral technologies have been proposed which both save fuel and provide significantly faster travel than the traditional methodology of using [[#Hohmann transfers|Hohmann transfers]]. Some are still just theoretical, but over time, several of the theoretical approaches have been tested on spaceflight missions.  For example, the [[Deep Space 1]] mission was a successful test of an [[ion drive]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/deep-space-1-ds1/|title=Deep Space 1|website=www.jpl.nasa.gov|access-date=2018-09-12}}</ref> These improved technologies typically focus on one or more of:\n* [[Space propulsion]] systems with much better fuel economy. Such systems would make it possible to travel much faster while keeping the fuel cost within acceptable limits.\n* Using solar energy and [[in-situ resource utilization]] to avoid or minimize the expensive task of shipping components and fuel up from the Earth's surface, against the Earth's gravity (see \"Using non-terrestrial resources\", below).\n* Novel methodologies of using energy at different locations or in different ways that can shorten transport time or reduce [[cost]] per unit mass of [[space transport]]\n\nBesides making travel faster or cost less, such improvements could also allow greater design \"safety margins\" by reducing the imperative to make spacecraft lighter.\n\n===Improved rocket concepts===\n{{main|Spacecraft propulsion}}\nAll rocket concepts are limited by the [[rocket equation]], which sets the characteristic velocity available as a function of exhaust velocity and mass ratio, of initial (''M''<sub>0</sub>, including fuel) to final (''M''<sub>1</sub>, fuel depleted) mass.  The main consequence is that mission velocities of more than a few times the velocity of the rocket motor exhaust (with respect to the vehicle) rapidly become impractical.\n\n====Nuclear thermal and solar thermal rockets====\n[[File:Nuclear thermal rocket en.png|thumb|250px|Sketch of nuclear thermal rocket]]\nIn a [[nuclear thermal rocket]] or [[solar thermal rocket]] a working fluid, usually [[hydrogen]], is heated to a high temperature, and then expands through a [[nozzle|rocket nozzle]] to create [[thrust]]. The energy replaces the chemical energy of the reactive chemicals in a traditional [[rocket engine]]. Due to the low molecular mass and hence high thermal velocity of hydrogen these engines are at least twice as fuel efficient as chemical engines, even after including the weight of the reactor.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nThe US [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] and NASA tested a few designs from 1959 to 1968. The NASA designs were conceived as replacements for the upper stages of the [[Saturn V]] launch vehicle, but the tests revealed reliability problems, mainly caused by the vibration and heating involved in running the engines at such high thrust levels. Political and environmental considerations make it unlikely such an engine will be used in the foreseeable future, since nuclear thermal rockets would be most useful at or near the Earth's surface and the consequences of a malfunction could be disastrous. Fission-based thermal rocket concepts produce lower exhaust velocities than the electric and plasma concepts described below, and are therefore less attractive solutions. For applications requiring high thrust-to-weight ratio, such as planetary escape, nuclear thermal is potentially more attractive.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n====Electric propulsion====\n[[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|Electric propulsion]] systems use an external source such as a [[nuclear reactor]] or [[solar cell]]s to generate [[electricity]], which is then used to accelerate a chemically inert propellant to speeds far higher than achieved in a chemical rocket. Such drives produce feeble thrust, and are therefore unsuitable for quick maneuvers or for launching from the surface of a planet. But they are so economical in their use of\n[[reaction mass]] that they can keep firing continuously for days or weeks, while chemical rockets use up reaction mass so quickly that they can only fire for seconds or minutes. Even a trip to the Moon is long enough for an electric propulsion system to outrun a chemical rocket \u2013 the [[Apollo program|Apollo]] missions took 3 days in each direction.\n\nNASA's [[Deep Space 1|Deep Space One]] was a very successful test of a prototype [[ion drive]], which fired for a total of 678 days and enabled the probe to run down Comet Borrelly, a feat which would have been impossible for a chemical rocket. [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn]], the first NASA operational (i.e., non-technology demonstration) mission to use an ion drive for its primary propulsion, is currently on track to explore and orbit the large [[main-belt asteroid]]s [[1 Ceres]] and [[4 Vesta]].  A more ambitious, nuclear-powered version was intended for an unmanned Jupiter mission, the [[Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter]] (JIMO), originally planned for launch sometime in the next decade. Due to a shift in priorities at NASA that favored manned space missions, the project lost funding in 2005.  A similar mission is currently under discussion as the US component of a joint NASA/ESA program for the exploration of [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]].\n\nA NASA multi-center Technology Applications Assessment Team led from the [[Johnson Spaceflight Center]], has as of January 2011 described \"Nautilus-X\", a concept study for a multi-mission space exploration vehicle useful for missions beyond [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO), of up to 24 months duration for a crew of up to six.<ref>[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=36068 Nautilus-X] \u2013 NASA's Multi-mission Space Exploration Vehicle Concept</ref><ref>[http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Holderman-Henderson_1-26-11/Holderman_1-26-11.pdf NAUTILUS-X] NASA/JSC Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle, Jan. 26, 2011.</ref>  Although [[Nautilus-X]] is adaptable to a variety of mission-specific propulsion units of various low-thrust, high [[specific impulse]] (I<sub>sp</sub>) designs, nuclear ion-electric drive is shown for illustrative purposes.  It is intended for integration and checkout at the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), and would be suitable for deep-space missions from the ISS to and beyond the Moon, including [[Lagrangian point|Earth/Moon L1]], [[Lagrangian point|Sun/Earth L2]], [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroidal]], and Mars orbital destinations.  It incorporates a reduced-g centrifuge providing artificial gravity for crew health to ameliorate the effects of long-term 0g exposure, and the capability to mitigate the space radiation environment.<ref>[http://moonandback.com/2011/02/21/nasa-team-produces-nautilus-x-a-fascinating-spacecraft/  \"NASA Team Produces NAUTILUS-X, A Fascinating Spacecraft\"] February 21, 2011</ref>\n\n====Fission powered rockets====\nThe electric propulsion missions already flown, or currently scheduled, have used [[solar electric]] power, limiting their capability to operate far from the Sun, and also limiting their peak acceleration due to the mass of the electric power source.  Nuclear-electric or plasma engines, operating for long periods at low thrust and powered by fission reactors, can reach speeds much greater than chemically powered vehicles.\n\n====Fusion rockets====\n[[Fusion rocket]]s,  powered by [[nuclear fusion]] reactions, would \"burn\" such light element fuels as deuterium, tritium, or <sup>3</sup>He.  Because fusion yields about 1% of the mass of the nuclear fuel as released energy, it is energetically more favorable than fission, which releases only about 0.1% of the fuel's mass-energy. However, either fission or fusion technologies can in principle achieve velocities far higher than needed for Solar System exploration, and fusion energy still awaits practical demonstration on Earth.\n\nOne proposal using a fusion rocket was [[Project Daedalus]].  Another fairly detailed vehicle system, designed and optimized for crewed Solar System exploration, \"Discovery II\",<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110610051632/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-213559.pdf PDF] C. R. Williams et al., 'Realizing \"2001: A Space Odyssey\": Piloted Spherical Torus Nuclear Fusion Propulsion', 2001, 52 pages, NASA Glenn Research Center</ref> based on the D<sup>3</sup>He reaction but using hydrogen as reaction mass, has been described by a team from NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]].  It achieves characteristic velocities of >300&nbsp;km/s with an acceleration of ~1.7\u202210<sup>\u22123</sup> ''g'', with a ship initial mass of ~1700 metric tons, and payload fraction above 10%.\n\n====Exotic propulsion====\nSee the [[spacecraft propulsion]] article for a discussion of a number of other technologies that could, in the medium to longer term, be the basis of interplanetary missions. Unlike the situation with [[interstellar travel]], the barriers to fast interplanetary travel involve engineering and economics rather than any basic physics.\n\n===Solar sails===\n{{main|Solar sail}}\n[[File:Solarsail msfc.jpg|left|thumb|NASA illustration of a solar-sail propelled spacecraft]]\nSolar sails rely on the fact that light reflected from a surface exerts pressure on the surface. The [[radiation pressure]] is small and decreases by the square of the distance from the Sun, but unlike rockets, solar sails require no fuel. Although the thrust is small, it continues as long as the Sun shines and the sail is deployed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~diedrich/cgi/search.cgi?solar+sail | title=Abstracts of NASA articles on solar sails | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311000832/http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~diedrich/cgi/search.cgi?solar+sail | archivedate=2008-03-11 | df= }}</ref>\n\nThe original concept relied only on radiation from the Sun \u2013 for example in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1965 story \"[[Sunjammer]]\". More recent light sail designs propose to boost the thrust by aiming ground-based [[laser]]s or [[maser]]s at the sail. Ground-based [[laser]]s or [[maser]]s can also help a light-sail spacecraft to ''decelerate'': the sail splits into an outer and inner section, the outer section is pushed forward and its shape is changed mechanically to focus reflected radiation on the inner portion, and the radiation focused on the inner section acts as a brake.\n\nAlthough most articles about light sails focus on [[interstellar travel]], there have been several proposals for their use within the Solar System.\n\nCurrently, the only spacecraft to use a solar sail as the main method of propulsion is [[IKAROS]] which was launched by [[JAXA]] on May 21, 2010. It has since been successfully deployed, and shown to be producing acceleration as expected.  Many ordinary spacecraft and satellites also use solar collectors, temperature-control panels and Sun shades as light sails, to make minor corrections to their attitude and orbit without using fuel. A few have even had small purpose-built solar sails for this use (for example Eurostar E3000 [[geostationary]] communications satellites built by [[EADS Astrium]]).\n\n===Cyclers===\nIt is possible to put stations or spacecraft on orbits that cycle between different planets, for example a [[Mars cycler]] would synchronously cycle between Mars and Earth, with very little propellant usage to maintain the trajectory. Cyclers are conceptually a good idea, because massive radiation shields, life support and other equipment only need to be put onto the cycler trajectory once. A cycler could combine several roles: habitat (for example it could spin to produce an \"artificial gravity\" effect); mothership (providing life support for the crews of smaller spacecraft which hitch a ride on it).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/2076326.html?page=1 | title=Buzz Aldrin's Roadmap To Mars | date=2005 | last=Aldrin | first=B | last2=Noland | first2=D | publisher=Popular Mechanics | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211195430/http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/air_space/2076326.html?page=1 | archivedate=2006-12-11 | df= }}</ref> Cyclers could also possibly make excellent cargo ships for resupply of a colony.\n\n===Space elevator===\n{{main|Space elevator}}\nA space elevator is a theoretical structure that would transport material from a planet's surface into orbit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/space_elevator_020327-1.html |title=The Space Elevator Comes Closer to Reality |last=David |first=D |publisher=space.com |date=2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104104658/http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/space_elevator_020327-1.html |archivedate=2010-11-04 |df= }}</ref> The idea is that, once the expensive job of building the elevator is complete, an indefinite number of loads can be transported into orbit at minimal cost. Even the simplest designs avoid the [[vicious circle]] of rocket launches from the surface, wherein the fuel needed to travel the last 10% of the distance into orbit must be lifted all the way from the surface, requiring even more fuel, and so on. More sophisticated space elevator designs reduce the energy cost per trip by using [[counterweight]]s, and the most ambitious schemes aim to balance loads going up and down and thus make the energy cost close to zero. Space elevators have also sometimes been referred to as \"[[Space elevator|beanstalks]]\", \"space bridges\", \"space lifts\", \"space ladders\" and \"orbital towers\".\n\nA terrestrial space elevator is beyond our current technology, although a [[lunar space elevator]] could theoretically be built using existing materials.\n\n===Skyhook===\n{{main|Skyhook (structure)}}\n[[File:Mature non-rotating Skyhook.png|thumb|[https://skyhooksandspaceelevators.wordpress.com Non-rotating skyhook] first proposed by E.

One alternative to transport more mass on interplanetary trajectories is to use up nearly all of the [[upper stage]] propellant on launch, and then refill propellants in Earth orbit before firing the rocket to [[escape velocity]] for a [[heliocentric orbit|heliocentric]] trajectory.  These propellants could be stored on orbit at a [[propellant depot]], or carried to orbit in a [[propellant tanker]] to be directly transferred to the interplanetary spacecraft.  For returning mass to Earth, a related option is to mine raw materials from a solar system celestial object, refine, process, and store the reaction products (propellant) on the Solar System body until such time as a vehicle needs to be loaded for launch.\n\n[[File:ITS Tanker (cropped).jpg|thumb|Rendering of an ''[[ITS tanker]]'' (top) transferring propellant to an ''[[Interplanetary Spaceship]]'' (bottom) in Earth orbit.]]\n\n====On-orbit tanker transfers====\nSpaceX is currently developing a system in which a reusable first stage vehicle would transport a manned interplanetary spacecraft to earth orbit, detach, return to its launch pad where a tanker spacecraft would be mounted atop it, then both fueled, then launched again to rendezvous with the waiting manned spacecraft.

At least two fundamental non-terrestrial energy sources have been proposed: solar-powered energy generation (unhampered by clouds), either directly by [[solar cell]]s or indirectly by focusing solar radiation on boilers which produce steam to drive generators; and [[electrodynamic tether]]s which generate electricity from the powerful magnetic fields of some planets (Jupiter has a very powerful magnetic field).\n\nWater ice would be very useful and is widespread on the moons of Jupiter and Saturn:\n* The low gravity of these moons would make them a cheaper source of water for space stations and planetary bases than lifting it up from Earth's surface.\n* Non-terrestrial power supplies could be used to [[electrolysis|electrolyse]] water ice into oxygen and hydrogen for use in [[bipropellant rocket]] engines.\n* [[Nuclear thermal rocket]]s or [[Solar thermal rocket]]s could use it as [[reaction mass]].

Non-terrestrial oxygen would be valuable as a source of water ice only if an adequate source of [[hydrogen]] can be found.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}<!-- if ice is found, then both O2 and H2 would be available, given the energy to melt and then electrolyze it -->  Possible uses include:\n\n* In the [[life support system]]s of space ships, space stations and planetary bases.\n* In rocket engines. Even if the other propellant has to be lifted from Earth, using non-terrestrial oxygen could reduce propellant launch costs by up to 2/3 for hydrocarbon fuel, or 85% for hydrogen. The savings are so high because oxygen accounts for the majority of the mass in most [[rocket propellant]] combinations.\n\nUnfortunately hydrogen, along with other volatiles like carbon and nitrogen, are much less abundant than oxygen in the inner Solar System.\n\nScientists expect to find a vast range of [[organic compound]]s in some of the planets, moons and comets of the [[outer Solar System]], and the range of possible uses is even wider. For example, [[methane]] can be used as a fuel (burned with non-terrestrial oxygen), or as a feedstock for [[petrochemical]] processes such as making [[plastic]]s. And [[ammonia]] could be a valuable feedstock for producing [[fertilizer]]s to be used in the vegetable gardens of orbital and planetary bases, reducing the need to lift food to them from Earth.\n\nEven unprocessed rock may be useful as rocket propellant if [[mass drivers]] are employed.\n\n==Design requirements for manned interplanetary travel==\n[[File:Nasa mars artificial gravity 1989.jpg|thumb|In the artistic vision, the spacecraft provides [[artificial gravity]] by spinning (1989)]]\n[[File:Deep Space Transport.jpg|thumb|Deep Space Transport and Gateway]]\n<!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:VenusFlybyCutaway.jpg|thumb|upright|Apollo era interplanetary spacecraft design]] -->\n\n===Life support===\n[[Life support system]]s must be capable of supporting human life for weeks, months or even years.

When [[in phase]], the two lower waves create [[constructive interference]] (left), resulting in a wave of greater amplitude. When 180\u00b0 [[out of phase]], they create [[destructive interference]] (right).]]\n\nIn [[physics]], '''interference''' is a phenomenon in which two [[wave]]s [[Superposition principle|superpose]] to form a resultant wave of greater, lower, or the same [[amplitude]]. Interference usually refers to the interaction of waves that are correlated or [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] with each other, either because they come from the same source or because they have the same or nearly the same [[frequency]]. Interference effects can be observed with all types of waves, for example, [[Light wave|light]], [[Radio wave|radio]], [[sound wave|acoustic]], [[surface wave|surface water wave]]s or [[matter wave]]s.\n\n== Mechanisms ==\n[[File:Waventerference.gif|thumb|Interference of left traveling (green) and right traveling (blue) waves in one dimension, resulting in final (red) wave]]\n[[Image:Two sources interference.gif|right|frame|Interference of waves from two point sources.]]\n[[File:3D Interference of Laser Light Through 2 Pinholes Animation.webm|thumb|thumbtime=3|Cropped tomography scan animation of laser light interference passing through two pinholes (side edges).]]\n\nThe [[superposition principle#Wave interference|principle of superposition of waves]] states that when two or more propagating waves of same type are incident on the same point, the resultant [[amplitude]] at that point is equal to the [[Euclidean vector#Addition and subtraction|vector sum]] of the amplitudes of the individual waves.<ref>Ockenga, Wymke. [http://www.leica-microsystems.com/science-lab/phase-contrast/ Phase Contrast]. Leika Science Lab, 09 June 2011. \"If two waves interfere, the amplitude of the resulting light wave will be equal to the vector sum of the amplitudes of the two interfering waves.\"</ref> If a [[Crest (physics)|crest]] of a wave meets a crest of another wave of the same frequency at the same point, then the amplitude is the sum of the individual amplitudes\u2014this is constructive interference. If a crest of one wave meets a trough of another wave, then the amplitude is equal to the difference in the individual amplitudes\u2014this is known as destructive interference.\n\n[[File:Interference colours in soap film 1.jpg|thumb|A magnified image of a coloured interference pattern in a soap film. The \"black holes\" are areas of almost total destructive interference (antiphase).]]\n\nConstructive interference occurs when the [[Phase (waves)|phase]] difference between the waves is an '''even multiple''' of \u03c0 (180\u00b0) , whereas destructive interference occurs when the difference is an '''odd multiple''' of \u03c0. If the difference between the phases is intermediate between these two extremes, then the magnitude of the displacement of the summed waves lies between the minimum and maximum values.\n\nConsider, for example, what happens when two identical stones are dropped into a still pool of water at different locations. Each stone generates a circular wave propagating outwards from the point where the stone was dropped. When the two waves overlap, the net displacement at a particular point is the sum of the displacements of the individual waves. At some points, these will be in phase, and will produce a maximum displacement. In other places, the waves will be in anti-phase, and there will be no net displacement at these points. Thus, parts of the surface will be stationary\u2014these are seen in the figure above and to the right as stationary blue-green lines radiating from the centre.\n\nInterference of light is a common phenomenon that can be explained classically by the superposition of waves, however a deeper understanding of light interference requires knowledge of    [[wave-particle duality]] of light which is due to [[quantum mechanics]].  Prime examples of light interference are the famous [[double-slit experiment]], [[laser speckle]], [[anti-reflective coating]]s and [[interferometer]]s.    Traditionally the classical wave model is taught as a basis for understanding optical interference, based the [[Huygens\u2013Fresnel principle]].\n\n===Derivation===\nThe above can be demonstrated in one dimension by deriving the formula for the sum of two waves.  The equation for the amplitude of a [[sinusoid]]al wave traveling to the right along the x-axis is\n:<math>W_1(x,t) = A\\cos(kx - \\omega t)\\,</math>\nwhere <math>A\\,</math> is the peak amplitude, <math>k = 2\\pi/\\lambda\\,</math> is the [[wavenumber]] and <math>\\omega = 2\\pi f\\,</math> is the [[angular frequency]] of the wave.  Suppose a second wave of the same frequency and amplitude but with a different phase is also traveling to the right    \n:<math>W_2(x,t) = A\\cos(kx - \\omega t + \\phi)\\,</math>\nwhere <math>\\phi\\,</math> is the phase difference between the waves in [[radian]]s.  The two waves will [[Superposition principle|superpose]] and add: the sum of the two waves is\n:<math>W_1 + W_2 = A[\\cos(kx - \\omega t) + \\cos(kx - \\omega t + \\phi)]\\,</math>\nUsing the [[trigonometric identity]] for the sum of two cosines: <math>\\cos a + \\cos b = 2\\cos\\Bigl({a-b \\over 2}\\Bigr)\\cos\\Bigl({a+b \\over 2}\\Bigr)\\,</math>, this can be written\n:<math>W_1 + W_2 = 2A\\cos\\Bigl({\\phi \\over 2}\\Bigr)\\cos\\Bigl(kx - \\omega t + {\\phi \\over 2}\\Bigr)\\,</math>\nThis represents a wave at the original frequency, traveling to the right like the components, whose amplitude is proportional to the cosine of <math>\\phi/2</math>. \n*''Constructive interference'': If the phase difference is an even multiple of pi: <math>\\phi = ...-4\\pi, -2\\pi, 0, 2\\pi, 4\\pi,...</math> then <math>|\\cos(\\phi/2)| = 1\\,</math>, so the sum of the two waves is a wave with twice the amplitude\n::<math>W_1 + W_2 = 2A\\cos(kx - \\omega t)</math>\n*''Destructive interference'': If the phase difference is an odd multiple of pi: <math>\\phi = ...-3\\pi,\\, -\\pi,\\, \\pi,\\, 3\\pi,\\, 5\\pi,...</math> then <math>\\cos(\\phi/2) = 0\\,</math>, so the sum of the two waves is zero\n::<math>W_1 + W_2 = 0\\,</math>\n\n===Between two plane waves===\n[[Image:interference of plane waves 3.svg|right|thumb|250px|Geometrical arrangement for two plane wave interference]][[Image:Interferences plane waves.jpg|right|thumb|Interference fringes in overlapping plane waves]]\nA simple form of interference pattern is obtained if two [[plane wave]]s of the same frequency intersect at an angle. \nInterference is essentially an energy redistribution process. The energy which is lost at the destructive interference is regained at the constructive interference.\nOne wave is travelling horizontally, and the other is travelling downwards at an angle \u03b8 to the first wave.  Assuming that the two waves are in phase at the point '''B''', then the relative phase changes along the ''x''-axis. The phase difference at the point '''A''' is given by\n\n:<math> \\Delta \\varphi = \\frac {2 \\pi d} {\\lambda} = \\frac {2 \\pi x \\sin \\theta} {\\lambda}</math>\n\nIt can be seen that the two waves are in phase when\n\n:<math> \\frac {x \\sin \\theta} {\\lambda} = 0, \\pm 1, \\pm 2, ...</math>,\n\nand are half a cycle out of phase when\n\n:<math> \\frac {x \\sin \\theta} {\\lambda} = \\pm \\frac {1}{2}, \\pm \\frac {3}{2}, ...</math>\n\nConstructive interference occurs when the waves are in phase, and destructive interference when they are half a cycle out of phase.  Thus, an interference fringe pattern is produced, where the separation of the maxima is\n\n:<math> d_f = \\frac {\\lambda} {\\sin \\theta}</math>\n\nand {{math|''d<sub>f''</sub>}} is known as the fringe spacing.  The fringe spacing increases with increase in [[wavelength]], and with decreasing angle {{math|\u03b8}}.\n\nThe fringes are observed wherever the two waves overlap and the fringe spacing is uniform throughout.\n\n=== Between two spherical waves ===\n[[Image:wavepanel.png|right|thumb|Optical interference between two point sources that have different wavelengths and separations of sources.]]\n\nA [[point source]] produces a spherical wave.  If the light from two point sources overlaps, the interference pattern maps out the way in which the phase difference between the two waves varies in space. This depends on the wavelength and on the separation of the point sources.  The figure to the right shows interference between two spherical waves.  The wavelength increases from top to bottom, and the distance between the sources increases from left to right.\n\nWhen the plane of observation is far enough away, the fringe pattern will be a series of almost straight lines, since the waves will then be almost planar.\n\n===Multiple beams===\nInterference occurs when several waves are added together provided that the phase differences between them remain constant over the observation time.\n\nIt is sometimes desirable for several waves of the same frequency and amplitude to sum to zero (that is, interfere destructively, cancel). This is the principle behind, for example, [[three-phase electric power|3-phase power]] and the [[diffraction grating]].  In both of these cases, the result is achieved by uniform spacing of the phases.\n\nIt is easy to see that a set of waves will cancel if they have the same amplitude and their phases are spaced equally in angle.  Using [[phasor]]s, each wave can be represented as <math>A e^{i \\varphi_n}</math> for <math>N</math> waves from <math>n=0</math> to <math>n = N-1</math>, where\n:<math>\\varphi_n - \\varphi_{n-1} = \\frac{2\\pi}{N}</math>.\n\nTo show that\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} A e^{i \\varphi_n} = 0</math>\n\none merely assumes the converse, then multiplies both sides by <math> e^{i \\frac{2\\pi}{N}}</math>\n\nThe [[Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot interferometer]] uses interference between multiple reflections.\n\nA [[diffraction grating]] can be considered to be a multiple-beam interferometer; since the peaks which it produces are generated by interference between the light transmitted by each of the elements in the grating; see [[interference vs. diffraction]] for further discussion.\n\n== Optical interference ==\n[[Image:Optical flat interference.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Creation of interference fringes by an [[optical flat]] on a reflective surface.  Light rays from a monochromatic source pass through the glass and reflect off both the bottom surface of the flat and the supporting surface.   The tiny gap between the surfaces means the two reflected rays have different path lengths. In addition the ray reflected from the bottom plate undergoes a 180\u00b0 phase reversal.  As a result, at locations '''''(a)''''' where the path difference is an odd multiple of \u03bb/2, the waves reinforce.   At locations '''''(b)''''' where the path difference is an even multiple of \u03bb/2 the waves cancel.  Since the gap between the surfaces varies slightly in width at different points, a series of alternating bright and dark bands, ''interference fringes'', are seen.  ]]\n\nBecause the frequency of light waves (~10<sup>14</sup> Hz) is too high to be detected by currently available detectors, it is possible to observe only the [[intensity (physics)|intensity]] of an optical interference pattern. The intensity of the light at a given point is proportional to the square of the average amplitude of the wave.  This can be expressed mathematically as follows. The displacement of the two waves at a point {{math|'''r'''}} is:\n\n:<math>U_1 (\\mathbf r,t) = A_1(\\mathbf r) e^{i [\\varphi_1 (\\mathbf r) - \\omega t]}</math>\n:<math>U_2 (\\mathbf r,t) = A_2(\\mathbf r) e^{i [\\varphi_2 (\\mathbf r) - \\omega t]}</math>\n\nwhere {{math|A}} represents the magnitude of the displacement, {{math|\u03c6}} represents the phase and {{math|\u03c9}} represents the [[angular frequency]].\n\nThe displacement of the summed waves is\n\n:<math>U (\\mathbf r,t) = A_1(\\mathbf r) e^{i [\\varphi_1 (\\mathbf r) - \\omega t]}+A_2(\\mathbf r) e^{i [\\varphi_2 (\\mathbf r) - \\omega t]}</math>\n\nThe intensity of the light at {{math|'''r'''}} is given by\n\n:<math> I(\\mathbf r) = \\int U (\\mathbf r,t) U^* (\\mathbf r,t) dt \\propto A_1^2 (\\mathbf r)+ A_2^2 (\\mathbf r) + 2 A_1 (\\mathbf r) A_2 (\\mathbf r) \\cos {[\\varphi_1 (\\mathbf r)-\\varphi_2 (\\mathbf r)]}</math>\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of the intensities of the individual waves as\n\n:<math> I(\\mathbf r) =  I_1 (\\mathbf r)+ I_2 (\\mathbf r) + 2 \\sqrt{ I_1 (\\mathbf r) I_2 (\\mathbf r)} \\cos {[\\varphi_1 (\\mathbf r)-\\varphi_2 (\\mathbf r)]}</math>\n\nThus, the interference pattern maps out the difference in phase between the two waves, with maxima occurring when the phase difference is a multiple of 2\u03c0. If the two beams are of equal intensity, the maxima are four times as bright as the individual beams, and the minima have zero intensity.\n\nThe two waves must have the same [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] to give rise to interference fringes since it is not possible for waves of different polarizations to cancel one another out or add together. Instead, when waves of different polarization are added together, they give rise to a wave of a different [[polarization (waves)#Polarization state|polarization state]].\n\n=== Light source requirements ===\nThe discussion above assumes that the waves which interfere with one another are monochromatic, i.e. have a single frequency\u2014this requires that they are infinite in time.  This is not, however, either practical or necessary. Two identical waves of finite duration whose frequency is fixed over that period will give rise to an interference pattern while they overlap.  Two identical waves which consist of a narrow spectrum of frequency waves of finite duration, will give a series of fringe patterns of slightly differing spacings, and provided the spread of spacings is significantly less than the average fringe spacing, a fringe pattern will again be observed during the time when the two waves overlap.\n\nConventional light sources emit waves of differing frequencies and at different times from different points in the source. If the light is split into two waves and then re-combined, each individual light wave may generate an interference pattern with its other half, but the individual fringe patterns generated will have different phases and spacings, and normally no overall fringe pattern will be observable.  However, single-element light sources, such as [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-]] or [[mercury-vapor lamp]]s have emission lines with quite narrow frequency spectra.  When these are spatially and colour filtered, and then split into two waves, they can be superimposed to generate interference fringes.<ref>WH  Steel, ''Interferometry'', 1986, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge</ref> All interferometry prior to the invention of the laser was done using such sources and had a wide range of successful applications.\n\nA [[laser beam]] generally approximates much more closely to a monochromatic source, and it is much more straightforward to generate interference fringes using a laser. The ease with which interference fringes can be observed with a laser beam can sometimes cause problems in that stray reflections may give spurious interference fringes which can result in errors.\n\nNormally, a single laser beam is used in interferometry, though interference has been observed using two independent lasers whose frequencies were sufficiently matched  to satisfy the phase requirements.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Pfleegor | first1 = R.

The [[iridescence]] is due to [[thin-film interference]].]]\nIt is also possible to observe interference fringes using white light.  A white light fringe pattern can be considered to be made up of a 'spectrum' of fringe patterns each of slightly different spacing. If all the fringe patterns are in phase in the centre, then the fringes will increase in size as the wavelength decreases and the summed intensity will show three to four fringes of varying colour.  Young describes this very elegantly in his discussion of two slit interference. Since white light fringes are obtained only when the two waves have travelled equal distances from the light source, they can be very useful in interferometry, as they allow the zero path difference fringe to be identified.<ref name = \"Born and Wolf\">[[Max Born]] and Emil Wolf, 1999, ''Principles of Optics'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.</ref>\n\n=== Optical arrangements ===\nTo generate interference fringes, light from the source has to be divided into two waves which have then to be re-combined. Traditionally, interferometers have been classified as either amplitude-division or wavefront-division systems.\n\nIn an amplitude-division system, a [[beam splitter]] is used to divide the light into two beams travelling in different directions, which are then superimposed to produce the interference pattern. The [[Michelson interferometer]] and the [[Mach-Zehnder interferometer]] are examples of amplitude-division systems.\n\nIn wavefront-division systems, the wave is divided in space\u2014examples are [[Young's double slit experiment|Young's double slit interferometer]] and [[Lloyd's mirror]].\n\nInterference can also be seen in everyday phenomena such as [[iridescence]] and [[structural coloration]].  For example, the colours seen in a soap bubble arise from interference of light reflecting off the front and back surfaces of the thin soap film.  Depending on the thickness of the film, different colours interfere constructively and destructively.\n\n== Applications ==\n{{Main|Interferometry}}\n\n=== Optical interferometry ===\n{{Main|Optical interferometry}}\nInterferometry has played an important role in the advancement of physics, and also has a wide range of applications in physical and engineering measurement.\n\n[[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]]'s double slit interferometer in 1803 demonstrated interference fringes when two small holes were illuminated by light from another small hole which was illuminated by sunlight.  Young was able to estimate the wavelength of different colours in the spectrum from the spacing of the fringes.  The experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.<ref name = \"Born and Wolf\"/> \nIn quantum mechanics, this experiment is considered to demonstrate the inseparability of the wave and particle natures of light and other quantum particles ([[wave\u2013particle duality]]). [[Richard Feynman]] was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can be gleaned from carefully thinking through the implications of this single experiment.<ref name=\"Greene_1999\">{{cite book|last =Greene|first =Brian|authorlink =Brian Greene|title =[[The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory]] |publisher =W.W.

When the metre was defined as the distance between two marks on a platinum-iridium bar, [[Albert Abraham Michelson|Michelson]] and Beno\u00eet used interferometry to measure the wavelength of the red [[cadmium]] line in the new standard, and also showed that it could be used as a length standard. Sixty years later, in 1960, the metre in the new [[SI]] system was defined to be equal to 1,650,763.73 wavelengths of the orange-red emission line in the electromagnetic spectrum of the krypton-86 atom in a vacuum.  This definition was replaced in 1983 by defining the metre as the distance travelled by light in vacuum during a specific time interval. Interferometry is still fundamental in establishing the [[calibration]] chain in length measurement.\n\nInterferometry is used in the calibration of [[Gauge block|slip gauges]] (called gauge blocks in the US) and in [[coordinate-measuring machine]]s. It is also used in the testing of optical components.<ref>RS Longhurst,  ''Geometrical and Physical Optics'', 1968, Longmans, London.</ref>\n\n===Radio interferometry===\n{{main|Astronomical interferometer}}\n\n[[Image:USA.NM.VeryLargeArray.02.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Very Large Array]], an [[interferometer|interferometric array]] formed from many smaller [[telescope]]s, like many larger [[radio telescope]]s.]]\nIn 1946, a technique called [[Astronomical interferometer|astronomical interferometry]] was developed. Astronomical radio interferometers usually consist either of arrays of parabolic dishes or two-dimensional arrays of omni-directional antennas. All of the telescopes in the array are widely separated and are usually connected together using [[coaxial cable]], [[waveguide]], [[optical fiber]], or other type of [[transmission line]]. Interferometry increases the total signal collected, but its primary purpose is to vastly increase the resolution through a process called [[Aperture synthesis]]. This technique works by superposing (interfering) the signal waves from the different telescopes on the principle that waves that coincide with the same phase will add to each other while two waves that have opposite phases will cancel each other out. This creates a combined telescope that is equivalent in resolution (though not in sensitivity) to a single antenna whose diameter is equal to the spacing of the antennas furthest apart in the array.\n\n===Acoustic interferometry===\nAn [[acoustic interferometer]] is an instrument for measuring the physical characteristics of sound wave in a [[gas]] or liquid. It may be used to measure [[velocity]], wavelength, [[absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. A vibrating [[crystal]] creates the ultrasonic waves that are radiated into the medium. The waves strike a reflector placed  parallel to the crystal. The waves are then reflected back to the source and measured.\n\n== Quantum interference ==\n{{See also|Double-slit_experiment#Quantum_version_of_experiment|l1=Quantum version of double-slit experiment}}\n{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Fundamental concepts}}\n\nIf a system is in state <math>\\psi</math>, its [[wavefunction]] is described in Dirac or [[bra\u2013ket notation]] as:\n:<math>\n|\\psi \\rang = \\sum_i |i\\rangle \\langle i| \\psi \\rangle= \\sum_i |i\\rang \\psi_i\n</math>\n\nwhere the <math> |i\\rang</math>s specify the different quantum \"alternatives\" available (technically, they form an [[eigenvector]] [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]) and the <math>\\psi_i</math> are the [[probability amplitude]] coefficients, which are [[complex numbers]].\n\nThe probability of observing the system making a [[Atomic electron transition|transition]] or [[Quantum state|quantum leap]] from state <math>\\psi</math> to a new state <math>\\varphi</math> is the square of the modulus of the [[scalar product|scalar]] or [[inner product]] of the two states:\n:<math>\\operatorname{prob}(\\psi \\Rightarrow \\varphi) = |\\lang \\psi |\\varphi \\rang|^2 = |\\sum_i\\psi^*_i \\varphi_i |^2\n</math>\n:<math>\n= \\sum_{ij} \\psi^*_i \\psi_j \\varphi^*_j\\varphi_i= \\sum_{i} |\\psi_i|^2|\\varphi_i|^2 + \\sum_{ij;i \\ne j} \\psi^*_i \\psi_j \\varphi^*_j\\varphi_i\n</math>\n\nwhere <math> \\psi_i = \\lang i|\\psi \\rang </math> (as defined above) and similarly <math> \\varphi_i = \\lang i|\\varphi \\rang </math> are the coefficients of the final state of the system. * is the [[complex conjugate]] so that <math> \\psi_i^* = \\lang \\psi|i \\rang </math>, etc.\n\nNow let's consider the situation classically and imagine that the system transited from <math>|\\psi \\rang</math> to <math>|\\varphi \\rang</math> via an intermediate state <math>|i\\rang</math>.  Then we would ''classically'' expect the probability of the two-step transition to be the sum of all the possible intermediate steps.

These are consequently known as the ''quantum interference terms'', or ''cross terms''. This is a purely [[quantum effect]] and is a consequence of the non-additivity of the probabilities of quantum alternatives.\n\nThe interference terms vanish, via the mechanism of [[quantum decoherence]], if the intermediate state <math> |i\\rang</math> is measured or coupled with its environment{{clarify|date=October 2018}}. <ref name=\"zurek91\">[[Wojciech H.

In the [[United States]], a crime of similar severity and rules is called a [[felony]], which also requires an indictment.\n\n==England and Wales==\nIn relation to [[England and Wales]], the expression ''indictable offence'' means an offence which, if committed by an adult, is triable on [[indictment]], whether it is exclusively so triable or [[triable either way]]; and the term ''indictable'', in its application to offences, is to be construed accordingly. In this definition, references to the way or ways in which an offence is triable are to be construed without regard to the effect, if any, of section 22 of the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]] on the mode of trial in a particular case.<ref>The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 5 and Schedule 1 (in the heading [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1978/30/schedule/1/crossheading/construction-of-certain-expressions-relating-to-offences \"construction of certain expressions relating to offences\"]), as amended by section 154 of, and paragraph 169 of Schedule 7 to, the [[Magistrates' Courts Act 1980]].</ref>\n\nAn either-way offence allows the defendant to elect between trial by jury on indictment in the [[Crown Court]] and summary trial in a [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]]. However, the election may be overruled by the magistrates' court if the facts suggest that the [[sentence (law)|sentencing]] powers of a magistrates' court would be inadequate to reflect the seriousness of the offence.  \n\nIn relation to some indictable offences, for example criminal damage, only summary trial is available unless the damage caused exceeds \u00a35,000. \n\nA youth court has jurisdiction to try all indictable offences with the exception of homicide and certain firearms offences, and will normally do so provided that the available sentencing power of two years' detention is adequate to punish the offender if found guilty.\n\n===History===\nSee section 64 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]]. \n\nGrand juries were abolished in 1933.\n\n===Offences triable only on indictment===\nSome offences such as [[murder]] and [[rape]] are considered so serious that they can only be tried on indictment at the [[Crown Court]] where the widest range of sentencing powers is available to the [[judge]].\n\nThe expression ''indictable-only offence'' was defined by [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/section/51 section 51] of the [[Crime and Disorder Act 1998]], as originally enacted, as an offence triable only on indictment. Sections 51 and 52 of, and Schedule 3 to, that Act abolished committal proceedings for such offences and made other provisions in relation to them.\n\nWhen the accused is charged with an indictable-only offence, he or she will be tried in the Crown Court. The rules are different in England and Wales in respect of those under 18 years of age.\n\nSee also section 14(a) of the [[Criminal Law Act 1977]].\n\n==New Zealand==\nSimilarly in New Zealand, a rape or murder charge will be tried at the High Court, while less serious offences such as theft, will be tried at the District Court. However, the District Court can hold both jury and summary trials.\n\n==Canada==\nFor differences between indictable offences and summary offences see [[summary offence#Canada|summary offences]].\n\n==United States==\nIn United States penal law, other than a felony, court findings of, or an act of [[gross negligence]] can be counted as an indictable offence.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Federal crime]]\n*[[Felony]]\n*[[Indictment]]\n*[[Summary offence]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{English criminal law navbox}}\n\n[[Category:Common law]]\n[[Category:Crimes]]\n[[Category:Criminal law]]", "sha1": "8kn85lo03b2fpu8pbzm9pb27zlkna3p"}}, {"title": "Inter Milan", "ns": "0", "id": "15116", "revision": {"id": "866387516", "parentid": "865873139", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T01:14:10Z", "contributor": {"username": "Alexchen4836", "id": "9324631"}, "comment": "link", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Redirect-multi|4|FC Internazionale|Internazionale|Internazionale Milano|Internazionale Milan|other uses|Internazionale (disambiguation)}}\n{{pp-semi-indef}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{EngvarB|date=May 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2017}}\n{{Infobox football club\n| clubname = Internazionale\n| fullname = Football Club Internazionale Milano [[Societ\u00e0 per azioni|S.p.A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/stream/e617f5c3-8b3e-44f8-b528-54896002132c|title=FC Internazionale Milano SpA|website=Financial Times|language=en|access-date=13 June 2018}}</ref>\n| image = Inter Milan.svg\n| image_size = 205px\n| current = {{Italian football updater|Internazionale4}}\n| nickname = {{unbulleted list|''I Nerazzurri'' (The Black and Blues)|''La Beneamata'' (The Cherished One)|''Il [[Biscione]]'' (The Big Grass Snake)}}\n| founded = {{Start date and age|df=yes|1908|3|9}}\n| ground = [[San Siro|Giuseppe Meazza]]\n| capacity = {{Formatnum:80018}}\n| owner    = {{unbulleted list|{{nowrap|[[Suning Holdings Group]]}} (68.55%)<ref name=\"Suning\">{{cite web |url=http://www.inter.it/en/news/53171 |title=SUNING HOLDINGS GROUP ACQUIRES MAJORITY STAKE OF F.C.

The captain and coach of the first championship winning team was [[Virgilio Fossati]], who was later killed in battle while serving in the Italian army during [[World War I]].\n\nIn 1922, Inter remained in the top league after winning two play-offs. Six years later, during the Fascist era, the club was forced to merge with the ''Unione Sportiva Milanese'' and was renamed ''Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Ambrosiana''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/en/societa/storia.html|publisher=FC Internazionale Milano|title=Storia|accessdate=6 September 2007}}</ref> The team wore white [[Jersey (clothing)|jerseys]] during this time with a red cross emblazoned on it. The jersey's design was inspired by the flag and coat of arms of the city of Milan. In 1929, club chairman Oreste Simonotti changed the club's name to ''Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana'', however supporters continued to call the team ''Inter'', and in 1931 new chairman Pozzani caved in to shareholder pressure and changed the name to ''Associazione Sportiva Ambrosiana-Inter''.\n\n[[File:Giuseppe Meazza 1935.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Giuseppe Meazza]] still holds the record for the most goals scored in a debut season in Serie A, with 31 goals in his first season (1929\u201330)]]\nTheir first [[Coppa Italia]] (Italian Cup) was won in 1938\u201339, led by the iconic [[Giuseppe Meazza]], after whom the [[San Siro]] stadium is officially named.

After the end of [[World War II]] the club regained its original name, winning its sixth championship in 1953 and its seventh in 1954.\n\n===''Grande Inter''===\n[[File:Sandro mazzola inter.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sandro Mazzola]] played for the highly successful Inter team remembered by the name of \"La Grande Inter\", during the 60s]]\nIn 1960, manager [[Helenio Herrera]] joined Inter from [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], bringing with him his midfield general [[Luis Su\u00e1rez (footballer, born 1935)|Luis Su\u00e1rez]], who won the [[European Footballer of the Year]] in the same year for his role in Barcelona's [[La Liga]]/[[Inter-Cities Fairs Cup|Fairs Cup]] double. He would transform Inter into one of the greatest teams in Europe. He modified a 5\u20133\u20132 tactic known as the \"''Verrou''\" (\"door bolt\") which created greater flexibility for counterattacks. The ''[[catenaccio]]'' system was invented by an Austrian coach, [[Karl Rappan]]. Rappan's original system was implemented with four fixed defenders, playing a strict man-to-man marking system, plus a [[playmaker]] in the middle of the field who plays the ball together with two midfield [[Midfielder#Winger|wings]]. Herrera would modify it by adding a fifth defender, the [[Sweeper (association football)|sweeper or libero]] behind the two [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre back]]s. The [[Sweeper (football)|sweeper]] or [[Libero (football)|libero]] who acted as the free man would deal with any attackers who went through the two [[centre back]]s. Inter finished third in the Serie A in his first season, second the next year and first in his third season. Then followed a back-to-back [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] victory in 1964 and 1965, earning him the title \"''il Mago''\" (\"the Wizard\"). The core of Herrera's team were the attacking [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|fullbacks]] [[Tarcisio Burgnich]] and [[Giacinto Facchetti]], [[Armando Picchi]] the sweeper, Su\u00e1rez the playmaker, [[Jair da Costa|Jair]] the winger, [[Mario Corso]] the left midfielder, and [[Sandro Mazzola]], who played on the inside-right.<ref name=\"Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-tournaments/players-coaches/people=61622/profile.html|title=Helenio Herrera: More than just catenaccio|website=www.fifa.com|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/707/431/index.html|title=Mazzola: Inter is my second family|publisher=FIFA.com|accessdate=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=leggenda>{{cite web|url=http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html |title=La leggenda della Grande Inter|trans-title=The legend of the Grande Inter|publisher=Inter.it|language=Italian|accessdate=10 September 2014 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019213304/http://www.inter.it/it/societa/storia2005-2.html|archivedate=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref name=sempreinter>{{cite web|url=http://www.sempreinter.com/2012/10/15/la-grande-inter-helenio-herrera-1910-1997-il-mago/|title=La Grande Inter: Helenio Herrera (1910\u20131997) \u2013 \"Il Mago\"|publisher=Sempre Inter|language=Italian|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1606149-great-team-tactics-breaking-down-helenio-herreras-la-grande-inter|title=Great Team Tactics: Breaking Down Helenio Herrera's 'La Grande Inter'|publisher=Bleacher Report|accessdate=10 September 2014}}</ref><ref name=Obituary>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obitaury-helenio-herrera-1293412.html |title=Obituary: Helenio Herrera \u2013 Obituaries, News |work=The Independent |location=UK |first=Norman |last=Fox |date= 11 November 1997|accessdate=22 April 2011 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, Inter reached the [[1964 European Cup Final|European Cup Final]] by beating [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the semi-final and [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] in the quarter-final. In the final, they met [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], a team that had reached seven out of the nine finals to date. Mazzola scored two goals in a 3\u20131 victory, and then the team won the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] against [[Independiente de Avellaneda|Independiente]]. A year later, Inter repeated the feat by beating two-time winner [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] in the [[1965 European Cup Final|final]] held at home, from a Jair goal, and then again beat Independiente in the Intercontinental Cup.\n\nIn 1967, with Jair gone and Su\u00e1rez injured, Inter lost the European Cup Final 2\u20131 to [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. During that year the club changed its name to ''Football Club Internazionale Milano''.\n{{clear|both}}\n\n===After Helenio Herrera era===\nFollowing the golden era of the 1960s, Inter managed to win their eleventh league title in 1971 and their twelfth in 1980. Inter were defeated for the second time in five years in the final of the European Cup, going down 0\u20132 to [[Johan Cruyff]]'s [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 1972. During the 1970s and the 1980s, Inter also added two to its Coppa Italia tally, in 1977\u201378 and 1981\u201382.\n\nLed by the German duo of [[Andreas Brehme]] and [[Lothar Matth\u00e4us]], and Argentine [[Ram\u00f3n D\u00edaz]], Inter captured the 1989 Serie A championship. Inter were unable to defend their title despite adding fellow German [[J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann]] to the squad and winning their first [[1989 Supercoppa Italiana|Supercoppa Italiana]] at the start of the season.\n\n===Mixed fortunes===\n[[File:Festeggiamenti Coppa UEFA Inter-Salisburgo 1993-1994.jpg|thumb|Inter celebrating their [[1993\u201394 UEFA Cup]] win against [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Austria Salzburg]]]]\nThe 1990s was a period of disappointment. While their great rivals Milan and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] were achieving success both domestically and in Europe, Inter were left behind, with repeated mediocre results in the domestic league standings, their worst coming in [[1993\u201394 Serie A|1993\u201394]] when they finished just one point out of the relegation zone. Nevertheless, they achieved some European success with three [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] victories in 1991, 1994 and 1998.\n\nWith [[Massimo Moratti]]'s takeover from Ernesto Pellegrini in 1995, Inter twice broke the [[World football transfer record|world record transfer fee]] in this period ([[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]19.5&nbsp;million for [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] from Barcelona in 1997 and \u00a331&nbsp;million for [[Christian Vieri]] from [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] two years later).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Smyth|first1=Rob|title=Ronaldo at 40: Il Fenomeno\u2019s legacy as greatest ever No 9, despite dodgy knees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/sep/17/ronaldo-40-birthday-brazil-greatest-ever-striker|publisher=''The Guardian''|date=17 September 2016|access-date=7 September 2018}}</ref> However, the 1990s remained the only decade in Inter's history in which they did not win a single Serie A championship. For Inter fans, it was difficult to find who in particular was to blame for the troubled times and this led to some icy relations between them and the chairman, the managers and even some individual players.\n[[File:Jerseys of Ronaldo, Zanetti, Zamorano & Figo.jpg|thumb|left|Jerseys of [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] (number 10), [[Iv\u00e1n Zamorano|Zamorano]] (one plus eight) and [[Lu\u00eds Figo|Figo]] (seven) in the San Siro museum]]\nMoratti later became a target of the fans, especially when he sacked the much-loved coach [[Luigi Simoni]] after only a few games into the 1998\u201399 season, having just received the Italian manager of the year award for 1998 the day before being dismissed. That season, Inter failed to qualify for any European competition for the first time in almost ten years, finishing in eighth place.\n\nThe following season, Moratti appointed former Juventus manager [[Marcello Lippi]], and signed players such as [[Angelo Peruzzi]] and [[Laurent Blanc]] together with other former Juventus players Vieri and [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]]. The team came close to their first domestic success since 1989 when they reached the [[Coppa Italia]] final only to be defeated by Lazio.\n\nInter's misfortunes continued the following season, losing the [[2000 Supercoppa Italiana]] match against Lazio 4\u20133 after initially taking the lead through new signing [[Robbie Keane]]. They were also eliminated in the preliminary round of the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] by Swedish club [[Helsingborgs IF]], with [[\u00c1lvaro Recoba]] missing a crucial late penalty. Lippi was sacked after only a single game of the new season following Inter's first ever Serie A defeat to [[Reggina Calcio|Reggina]]. [[Marco Tardelli]], chosen to replace Lippi, failed to improve results, and is remembered by Inter fans as the manager that lost 6\u20130 in the city derby against Milan. Other members of the Inter \"family\" during this period that suffered were the likes of Vieri and [[Fabio Cannavaro]], both of whom had their restaurants in Milan vandalised after defeats to the ''Rossoneri''.\n\nIn 2002, not only did Inter manage to make it to the UEFA Cup semi-finals, but were also only 45 minutes away from capturing the ''Scudetto'' when they needed to maintain their one-goal advantage away to Lazio. Inter were 2\u20131 up after only 24 minutes. Lazio equalised during first half injury time and then scored two more goals in the second half to clinch victory that eventually saw Juventus win the championship. The next season, Inter finished as league runners-up and also managed to make it to the [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|2002\u201303 Champions League]] semi-finals against Milan, losing on the [[away goals rule]].\n\n===Comeback and unprecedented treble===\n[[File:Consegna Coppa Italia. Inter-Roma 11 05 2006.jpg|thumb|Inter won the [[2004-05 Coppa Italia]], beating [[A.S. Roma]]]]\nOn 8 July 2004, Inter appointed former Lazio coach [[Roberto Mancini]] as its new head coach. In his first season, the team collected 72 points from 18 wins, 18 draws and only two losses, as well as winning the Coppa Italia and later the Supercoppa Italiana. On 11 May 2006, Inter retained their Coppa Italia title once again after defeating [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] with a 4\u20131 aggregate victory (a 1\u20131 scoreline in Rome and a 3\u20131 win at the San Siro).\n\nInter were awarded the [[2005\u201306 Serie A]] championship retrospectively after points were stripped from Juventus and Milan due to the [[2006 Serie A scandal|match fixing scandal that year]]. During the following season, Inter went on a record-breaking run of 17 consecutive victories in Serie A, starting on 25 September 2006 with a 4\u20131 home victory over [[A.S. Livorno Calcio|Livorno]], and ending on 28 February 2007, after a 1\u20131 draw at home to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]]. On 22 April 2007, Inter won their second consecutive ''Scudetto''\u2014and first on the field since 1989\u2014when they defeated [[S.S. Robur Siena|Siena]] 2\u20131 at [[Stadio Artemio Franchi (Siena)|Stadio Artemio Franchi]].

The team started well in the league, topping the table from the first round of matches, and also managed to qualify for the Champions League knockout stage. However, a late collapse, leading to a 2\u20130 defeat with ten men away to [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] on 19 February in the Champions League, threw into question manager Roberto Mancini's future at Inter while domestic form took a sharp turn of fortune with the team failing to win in the three following Serie A games. After being eliminated by Liverpool in the Champions League, Mancini announced his intention to leave his job immediately only to change his mind the following day. On the final day of the [[2007\u201308 Serie A]] season, Inter played [[Parma Calcio 1913|Parma]] away, and two goals from [[Zlatan Ibrahimovi\u0107]] sealed their third consecutive championship.

In 1928, Inter's name and philosophy made the ruling Fascist Party uneasy. As a result, during the same year the 20-year-old club was merged with ''Unione Sportiva Milanese''. The new club was named ''Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Ambrosiana'' after the patron saint of Milan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://emeroteca.coni.it/?q=node/6&f=822&p=1 |title=Emeroteca Coni |publisher=Emeroteca.coni.it |date= |accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref> The [[flag of Milan]] (the red cross on white background) replaced the traditional black and blue.<ref name=\"ambrosianacolours\">{{cite news|url=http://www.toffs.com/icat/ambrosiana|publisher=Toffs.com|title=Ambrosiana S.S 1928|date=24 June 2007}}</ref> After World War II, when the Fascists had fallen from power, the club reverted to their original name and colours. In 2008, Inter celebrated their centenary with a red cross on their away shirt. The cross is reminiscent of the flag of their city, and they continue to use the pattern on their third kit. In 2014, the club adopted a predominantly black home kit with thin blue pinstripes before returning to a more traditional design the following season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2686128/Mauro-Icardi-models-Inter-Milans-new-pinstripe-2014-15-home-kit.html|publisher=Daily Mail|title=Mauro Icardi models Inter Milan's new pinstripe 2014\u201315 home kit|date=9 July 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnimals are often used to represent football clubs in Italy \u2013 the [[grass snake]], called ''[[Biscione]]'' or ''Serpente'', represents Inter. The snake is an important symbol for the city of Milan, appearing often in Milanese [[heraldry]] as a coiled viper with a man in its jaws. The symbol is famous for its presence on the coat of arms of the [[House of Sforza]] (which ruled over Italy from Milan during the [[Renaissance]] period), the city of Milan, the historical [[Duchy of Milan]] (a 400-year state of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]) and [[Insubria]] (a historical region the city of Milan falls within). For the [[2010\u201311 Serie A|2010\u201311 season]], Inter's away kit featured the serpent.\n\n==Stadium==\n{{main|San Siro}}\n{{See also|Arena Civica}}\n[[File:Scudo2009.jpg|thumb|300px|San Siro during an Inter match]]\n\nThe team's stadium is the 80,018 seat [[San Siro]], officially known as the ''Stadio Giuseppe Meazza'' after the former player who represented both Milan and Inter. The more commonly used name, ''San Siro'', is the name of [[San Siro (district)|the district where it is located]]. San Siro has been the home of Milan since 1926, when it was privately built by funding from Milan's chairman at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13 and a half months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city council in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Inter, when they were accepted as joint tenant.\n\nThe first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Inter beat Milan 6\u20133 in a friendly match. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1\u20132 to [[Sampierdarenese]]. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008, its capacity was reduced to 80,018 to meet the new standards set by [[UEFA]].\n\nBased on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches owing to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of [[flare]]s by supporters contributes to the atmosphere, but the practice has occasionally also caused problems.\n\n==Supporters and rivalries==\n{{main article|Derby della Madonnina|Derby d'Italia}}\n[[File:Serie A 1979-80 - AC Milan v Inter Milan - Giuseppe and Franco Baresi.jpg|thumb|left|Brothers [[Giuseppe Baresi|Giuseppe]] (left) and [[Franco Baresi|Franco]] (right) Baresi face each other in the [[1979\u201380 Serie A|1979\u201380]] [[Derby della Madonnina|Milan derby]]]]\nInter is one of the most supported clubs in Italy, according to an August 2007 research by Italian newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]''.<ref name=research>{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/08/sezioni/sport/calcio/tifo-contro/tifo-contro/tifo-contro.html|publisher=La Repubblica official website|title=Research: Supporters of football clubs in Italy|date=August 2007|language=Italian}}</ref> Historically, the largest section of Inter fans from the city of Milan were the [[middle class|middle-class]] [[bourgeoisie]] Milanese, while Milan fans were typically [[working class|working-class]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe traditional [[ultras]] group of Inter is ''Boys San''; they hold a significant place in the history of the ultras scene in general due to the fact that they are one of the oldest, being founded in 1969. Politically, the ultras of Inter are usually considered right-wing and they have good relationships with the Lazio ultras. As well as the main group of ''Boys San'', there are four more significant groups: ''Viking'', ''Irriducibili'', ''Ultras'', and ''Brianza Alcoolica''.\n\nInter's most vocal fans are known to gather in the Curva Nord, or north curve of the San Siro. This longstanding tradition has led to the Curva Nord being synonymous with the club's most die-hard supporters, who unfurl banners and wave flags in support of their team.\n\n[[File:Inter vs Milan - 1915 - Coppa Gazzetta dello Sport.jpg|thumb|300px|Scene of a Derby della Madonnina in 1915]]\nInter have several rivalries, two of which are highly significant in [[Italian football]]; firstly, they participate in the intra city ''[[Derby della Madonnina]]'' with [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]; the rivalry has existed ever since Inter splintered off from Milan in 1908.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /> The name of the derby refers to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]], whose statue atop the [[Milan Cathedral]] is one of the city's main attractions. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the match. [[Flare]]s are commonly present, but they also led to the abandonment of the second leg of the [[2004\u201305 UEFA Champions League|2004\u201305 Champions League]] quarter-final matchup between Milan and Inter on 12 April after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan keeper [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]] on the shoulder.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/4432047.stm|publisher=BBC |title=Milan game ended by crowd trouble|date=25 July 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe other most significant rivalry is with Juventus; the two participate in the ''[[Derby d'Italia]]''. Up until the [[2006 Italian football scandal]], which saw Juventus relegated, the two were the only Italian clubs to have never played below Serie A. In recent years, post-''Calciopoli'', Inter have developed a rivalry with [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], having finished runners-up to Inter in all but one of Inter's five ''Scudetto''-winning seasons between 2005 and 2010. The two sides have also contested in five Coppa Italia finals and four Supercoppa Italiana finals since 2006. Other clubs, like [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], are also considered amongst their rivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rangers.it/avversari/inter.html |title=INTER: gli Ultras avversari&nbsp;\u2013 Rangers 1976 Empoli Ultras |publisher=Rangers.it |date= |accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\nTheir supporters collectively go by ''Interisti,'' or ''Nerazzurri.''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.inter.it/en/interisti_new|title=INTERISTI|accessdate=22 September 2015|publisher=F.C.

Administration of Type I IFN has been shown experimentally to inhibit tumor growth in animals, but the beneficial action in human tumors has not been widely documented. \nA virus-infected cell releases viral particles that can infect nearby cells. However, the infected cell can prepare neighboring cells against a potential infection of the virus by releasing interferons.  In response to interferon, cells produce large amounts of an [[enzyme]] known as [[protein kinase R]] (PKR). This enzyme [[phosphorylation|phosphorylates]] a protein known as [[eIF-2]] in response to new viral infections; the phosphorylated eIF-2 forms an inactive complex with another protein, called [[eIF2B]], to reduce protein synthesis within the cell. Another cellular enzyme, [[RNAse L]]\u2014also induced by interferon action\u2014destroys RNA within the cells to further reduce protein synthesis of both viral and host genes.  Inhibited protein synthesis destroys both the virus and infected host cells. In addition, interferons induce production of hundreds of other proteins\u2014known collectively as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs)\u2014that have roles in combating viruses and other actions produced by interferon.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fensterl V, Sen GC | title = Interferons and viral infections | journal = BioFactors | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 14\u201320 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19319841 | doi = 10.1002/biof.6 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = de Veer MJ, Holko M, Frevel M, Walker E, Der S, Paranjape JM, Silverman RH, Williams BR | title = Functional classification of interferon-stimulated genes identified using microarrays | journal = Journal of Leukocyte Biology | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 912\u201320 | date = June 2001 | pmid = 11404376 }}</ref>\nThey also limit viral spread by increasing [[p53]] activity, which kills virus-infected cells by promoting [[apoptosis]].<ref name=\"Takaoka\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Takaoka A, Hayakawa S, Yanai H, Stoiber D, Negishi H, Kikuchi H, Sasaki S, Imai K, Shibue T, Honda K, Taniguchi T | title = Integration of interferon-alpha/beta signalling to p53 responses in tumour suppression and antiviral defence | journal = Nature | volume = 424 | issue = 6948 | pages = 516\u201323 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12872134 | doi = 10.1038/nature01850 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v424/n6948/pdf/nature01850.pdf | bibcode = 2003Natur.424..516T }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Moiseeva O, Mallette FA, Mukhopadhyay UK, Moores A, Ferbeyre G | title =  DNA Damage Signaling and p53-dependent Senescence after Prolonged \u03b2-Interferon Stimulation | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 1583\u201392 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16436515 | pmc = 1415317 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.E05-09-0858 }}</ref>  The effect of IFN on p53 is also linked to its protective role against certain cancers.<ref name=\"Takaoka\" />\n\nAnother function of interferons is to upregulate major histocompatibility complex molecules, [[MHC I]] and [[MHC II]], and increase  [[immunoproteasome]] activity.  Higher MHC I expression increases presentation of viral peptides to [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, while the immunoproteasome processes viral peptides for loading onto the MHC I molecule, thereby increasing the recognition and killing of infected cells.  Higher MHC II expression increases presentation of viral peptides to [[helper T cell]]s; these cells release cytokines (such as more interferons and [[interleukins]], among others) that signal to and co-ordinate the activity of other immune cells.\n\nInterferons, such as [[interferon gamma]], directly activate other immune cells, such as [[macrophage]]s and [[natural killer cell]]s.\n\n==Induction of interferons==\nProduction of interferons occurs mainly in response to microbes, such as viruses and bacteria, and their products.

Being cut off by Jewish settlements the minority population will find it difficult to form a territorial and political continuity.\"''<br /><br />\n\n''\"There mustn't be even the shadow of a doubt about our intention to keep the territories of Judea and Samaria for good.

"text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Irrealism''' is a term that has been used by various writers in the fields of philosophy, literature, and art to denote specific modes of unreality and/or the problems in concretely defining reality.  While in philosophy the term specifically refers to a position put forward by the American philosopher [[Nelson Goodman]], in literature and art it refers to a variety of writers and movements.  If the term has nonetheless retained a certain consistency in its use across these fields and would-be movements, it perhaps reflects the word\u2019s position in general English usage: though the standard dictionary definition of ''irreal'' gives it the same meaning as ''unreal'', ''irreal'' is very rarely used in comparison with ''unreal''.  Thus, it has generally been used to describe something which, while unreal, is so in a very specific or unusual fashion, usually one emphasizing not just the \"not real,\" but some form of estrangement from our generally accepted sense of reality.\n\n==Irrealism in Literature==\n\nIn literature, the term irrealism was first used extensively in the United States in the 1970s to describe the post-realist \"new fiction\" of writers such as [[Donald Barthelme]] or [[John Barth]].  More generally, it described the notion that all forms of writing could only \"offer particular versions of reality rather than actual descriptions of it,\" and that a story need not offer a clear resolution at its end.  [[John Gardner (novelist)|John Gardner]], in ''The Art of Fiction'', cites in this context the work of Barthelme and its \"seemingly limitless ability to manipulate [literary] techniques as modes of apprehension [which] apprehend nothing.\"<ref>(Gardner 1984)</ref>   Though Barth, in a 1974 interview, stated, \"irrealism\u2014not antirealism or unrealism, but irrealism\u2014is all that I would confidently predict is likely to characterize the prose fiction of the 1970s,\" <ref>(Bellamy 1974)</ref> this did not prove to be the case.  Instead writing in the United States quickly returned to its realist orthodoxy and the term irrealism fell into disuse.\n\nIn recent years, however, the term has been revived in an attempt to describe and categorize, in literary and philosophical terms, how it is that the work of an irrealist writer differs from the work of writers in other, non-realistic genres (e.g., the fantasy of [[J.R.R. Tolkien]], the magical realism of [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]) and what the significance of this difference is.  This can be seen in Dean Swinford's essay ''Defining irrealism: scientific development and allegorical possibility''.[http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review1a.htm]  Approaching the issue from a structuralist and narratological point of view, he has defined irrealism as a \"peculiar mode of postmodern allegory\" that has resulted from modernity\u2019s fragmentation and dismantling of the well-ordered and coherent medieval system of symbol and allegory.  Thus a lion, when presented in a given context in medieval literature, could only be interpreted in a single, approved way.  Contemporary literary theory, however, denies the attribution of such fixed meanings.  According to Swinford, this change can be attributed in part to the fact that \"science and technical culture have changed perceptions of the natural world, have significantly changed the natural world itself, thereby altering the vocabulary of symbols applicable to [[epistemological]] and allegorical attempts to understand it.\"  Thus irreal works such as [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''Cosmicomics'' and [[Jorge Luis Borges]]' ''Ficciones'' can be seen as an attempt to find a new allegorical language to explain our changed perceptions of the world that have been brought about by our scientific and technical culture, especially concepts such as quantum physics or the theory of relativity.  \"The Irrealist work, then, operates within a given system,\" writes Swinford, \"and attests to its plausibility, despite the fact that this system, and the world it represents, is often a mutation, an aberration.\"\n\nThe online journal ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'' [http://www.cafeirreal.com/], on the other hand, has defined irrealism as being a type of existentialist literature in which the means are continually and absurdly rebelling against the ends that we have determined for them.<ref>Evans, G.S. and Alice Whittenburg, \"After Kafka: Kafka Criticism and Scholarship as a Resource in an Attempt to Promulgate a New Literary Genre,\" ''Journal of the Kafka Society of America'', 31/32(1+2):18-26.</ref> An example of this would be [[Franz Kafka]]'s story ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'', in which the salesman [[Gregor Samsa]]'s plans for supporting his family and rising up in rank by hard work and determination are suddenly thrown topsy-turvy by his sudden and inexplicable transformation into a man-sized insect.  Such fiction is said to emphasize the fact that human consciousness, being finite in nature, can never make complete sense of, or successfully order, a universe that is infinite in its aspects and possibilities.  Which is to say: as much as we might try to order our world with a certain set of norms and goals (which we consider our real world), the paradox of a finite consciousness in an infinite universe creates a zone of irreality (\"that which is beyond the real\") that offsets, opposes, or threatens the real world of the human subject.  Irrealist writing often highlights this irreality, and our strange fascination with it, by combining the unease we feel because the real world doesn't conform to our desires with the narrative quality of the dream state (where reality is constantly and inexplicably being undermined); it is thus said to communicate directly, \"by feeling rather than articulation, the uncertainties inherent in human existence or, to put it another way... the irreconcilability between human aspiration and human reality.\" [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/what_is_irr.htm]  If the irreal story can be considered an allegory, then, it would be an allegory that is \"so many pointers to an unknown meaning,\" in which the meaning is felt more than it is articulated or systematically analyzed.\n\n==Irrealism in Art==\n\nVarious writers have addressed the question of Irrealism in Art.  Many salient observations on Irrealism in Art are found in Nelson Goodman's ''Languages of Art''.  Goodman himself produced some multimedia shows, one of which inspired by hockey and is entitled ''Hockey Seen: A Nightmare in Three Periods and Sudden Death''.\n\nGarret [[Rowlan]], writing in ''[[The Cafe Irreal]]'', writes that the malaise present in the work of the Italian artist [[Giorgio de Chirico]], \"which recalls Kafka, has to do with the sense of another world lurking, hovering like the long shadows that dominate de Chirico's paintings, which frequently depict a landscape at twilight's uncertain hour. Malaise and mystery are all by-products of the interaction of the real and the unreal, the rub and contact of two worlds caught on irrealism's shimmering surface.\" [http://cafeirreal.alicewhittenburg.com/review4a.htm]\n\nThe writer Dean Swinford, whose concept of irrealism was described at length in the section \"Irrealism in Literature\", wrote that the artist Remedios Varos, in her painting ''The Juggler'', \"creates a personal allegorical system which relies on the predetermined symbols of Christian and classical iconography. But these are quickly refigured into a personal system informed by the scientific and organized like a machine...in the Irreal work, allegory operates according to an altered, but constant and orderly iconographic system.\"\n\nArtist Tristan Tondino has made a number of claims about Irrealism.  Most of his claims are found in his paintings, many of which are [[Lettrist]] Abstractions. \"There is no specific style to Irrealist Art.  It is the result of awareness that every human act is the result of the limitations of the world of the actor.\" <ref>Tondino 2003, ''Zot - Giving a Painter Crap...''</ref>\n\nIn Australia, the art journal ''the art life'' has recently detected the presence of a \"New Irrealism\" among the painters of that country, which is described as being an \"approach to painting that is decidedly low key, deploying its effects without histrionic showmanship, while creating an eerie other world of ghostly images and abstract washes.\" What exactly constituted the \"old\" irrealism, they do not say.\n\n== Irrealist Art, Film and Music Edition ==\n\nIrrealist Art Edition is a publishing company created in the 90s by contemporary plastic artist [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Iriarte]]. Together with the Estonian poet, writer and art critic [[Ilmar Laaban]], they developed their concept of Irrealism through several essays, exhibitions, projects, manifest and a book, \"Irr\u00e9alisation\".

Satirising the satire, he appended this comment to capitalism: \"...Then put both of them in your wife's name and declare bankruptcy.\" This material was later used as an element of his satirical US presidential campaign in 1968, and was included on his 1968 comedy album ''Pat Paulsen for President''.<ref>{{cite web\n  |url = http://www.livedailystore.com/B000069Z0Y/Pat_Paulsen_for_President.html\n  |title = \"Pat Paulsen for President\" - album info and review\n  |accessdate = 2007-12-18\n  |publisher = LiveDaily Store\n  |quote = ...included in this collection: \"Two Cows,\" where the various systems of government are explained with the useful illustration of two cows...\n}}</ref>\n\nRichard M Steers and Luciara Nardon in their book about global economy use the \"two cows\" metaphor to illustrate the concept of cultural differences.

IEC standards cover a vast range of technologies from power generation, transmission and distribution to home appliances and office equipment, semiconductors, fibre optics, batteries, [[solar energy]], [[nanotechnology]] and marine energy as well as many others. The IEC also manages three global conformity assessment systems that certify whether equipment, system or components conform to its International Standards.\n\nThe IEC charter embraces all electrotechnologies including energy production and distribution, electronics, magnetics and [[electromagnetics]], [[electroacoustics]], [[multimedia]], [[telecommunication]] and [[medical technology]], as well as associated general disciplines such as terminology and symbols, electromagnetic compatibility (by its Advisory Committee on [[Electromagnetic Compatibility]], ACEC), measurement and performance, dependability, design and development, safety and the environment.\n\n==History==\nThe first  [[International Electrical Congress]] took place in 1881 at the  [[International Exposition of Electricity]], held in Paris. At that time the [[International System of Electrical and Magnetic Units]] was agreed to. \n\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission held its inaugural meeting on 26 June 1906, following discussions among the British [[Institution of Electrical Engineers]], the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], and others, which began at the 1900 Paris International Electrical Congress,{{cn|date=April 2018}} and continued with [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] [[R. E. B. Crompton]] playing a key role. In 1906, [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Lord Kelvin]] was elected as the first President of the International Electrotechnical Commission <ref> The Life of William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs by Silvanus Phillips Thompson, CUP 2011, {{ISBN|1108027180}}, 9781108027182</ref>. \n[[File:International Electrotechnical Commission - Central Office - Geneva.jpg|thumb|250px|left|International Electrotechnical Commission - Central Office - Geneva]]\nThe IEC was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement, particularly the [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]], [[hertz]], and [[Weber (unit)|weber]]. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Electrical Engineering for Non-Electrical Engineers|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=1482228831|location=|pages=}}</ref> It also first proposed a system of standards, the [[Giovanni Giorgi|Giorgi System]], which ultimately became the [[SI]], or Syst\u00e8me International d\u2019unit\u00e9s (in English, the International System of Units).\n\nIn 1938, it published a multilingual international vocabulary to unify terminology relating to electrical, electronic and related technologies. This effort continues, and the [[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary]] (the on-line version of which is known as the ''Electropedia'') remains an important work in the electrical and electronic industries.\n\nThe [[CISPR]] (''[[Comit\u00e9 International Sp\u00e9cial des Perturbations Radio\u00e9lectriques]]'') \u2013 in English, the International Special Committee on Radio Interference \u2013 is one of the groups founded by the IEC.\n\nCurrently, 82 countries are members while another 82 participate in the Affiliate Country Programme, which is not a form of membership but is designed to help industrializing countries get involved with the IEC. Originally located in [[London]], the commission moved to its current headquarters in [[Geneva]] in 1948.\n\nIt has regional centres in Asia-Pacific ([[Singapore]]), Latin America ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (city)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], Brazil) and North America ([[Boston]], United States).\n\nToday, the IEC is the world's leading international organization in its field, and its standards are adopted as national standards by its members. The work is done by some 10,000 electrical and electronics experts from industry, government, academia, test labs and others with an interest in the subject.\n\n==IEC standards==\n{{see also|List of IEC standards}}\n\nIEC standards have numbers in the range 60000\u201379999 and their titles take a form such as ''IEC 60417: Graphical symbols for use on equipment''. Following the Dresden Agreement with [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization|CENELEC]] the numbers of older IEC standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000, for example IEC 27 became IEC 60027. Standards of the 60000 series are also found preceded by EN to indicate that the IEC standard is also adopted by CENELEC as a European standard; for example IEC 60034 is also available as EN 60034.\n\nThe IEC cooperates closely with the [[International Organization for Standardization|International Organization for Standardization (ISO)]] and the [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunication Union (ITU)]]. In addition, it works with several major standards development organizations, including the [[IEEE]] with which it signed a cooperation agreement in 2002, which was amended in 2008 to include joint development work.\n\nStandards developed jointly with ISO such as ISO/IEC 26300 (''Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) v1.0''), ISO/IEC 27001 (''Information technology, Security techniques, Information security management systems, Requirements''), and CASCO ISO/IEC 17000 series, carry the acronym of both organizations. The use of the ISO/IEC prefix covers publications from [[ISO/IEC JTC 1|ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 - Information Technology]], as well as conformity assessment standards developed by ISO CASCO and IEC CAB (Conformity Assessment Board). Other standards developed in cooperation between IEC and ISO are assigned numbers in the 80000 series, such as IEC 82045-1.\n\nIEC standards are also being adopted by other certifying bodies such as [[BSI Group|BSI]] (United Kingdom), [[Canadian Standards Association|CSA]] (Canada), [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] & [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]]/[[InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards|INCITS]] (United States), [[South African Bureau of Standards|SABS]] (South Africa), [[SAI Global|SAI]] (Australia), [[Standards Press for China|SPC]]/[[Guobiao standards|GB]] (China) and [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung|DIN]] (Germany). IEC standards adopted by other certifying bodies may have some noted differences from the original IEC standard.<ref>[http://webstore.iec.ch IEC Webstore | Welcome].

This includes manufacturers, providers, distributors and vendors, consumers and users, all levels of governmental agencies, professional societies and trade associations as well as standards developers from national standards bodies. National committees are constituted in different ways. Some NCs are public sector only, some are a combination of public and private sector, and some are private sector only.

To facilitate cross platform compatibility, it defined a minimal set of common file attributes (directory or ordinary file and time of recording) and name attributes (name, extension, and version), and used a separate system use area where future optional extensions for each file may be specified.\n\nHigh Sierra was adopted in December 1986 (with changes) as an international standard by [[Ecma International]] as ECMA-119<ref>{{cite web \n| url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-119.htm\n| title=Volume and File Structure of CDROM for Information Interchange \n| publisher=Ecma International\n|date=December 1987}}</ref> and submitted for fast tracking to the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], where it was eventually accepted as ISO 9660:1988.<ref name=ISO9660>{{cite book|title=Volume and file structure of CD-ROM for information interchange|date=1988-09-01|publisher=International Organisation for Standardization (ISO)|location=Geneva|edition=corrected}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, ISO published Amendment 1 to the ISO 9660 standard, introducing new data structures and relaxed file name rules intended to \"bring harmonization between ISO 9660 and widely used '[[Joliet (file system)|Joliet]] Specification'.\"<ref>ISO 9660, Amendment 1 (ISO 9660:1988/Amd.1:2013(E))</ref> In December 2017, a 3rd Edition of ECMA-119 was published that is technically identical with ISO 9660, Amendment 1.<ref>{{cite web |title=Standard ECMA-119 |url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-119.pdf |website=Ecma International |publisher=Ecma |accessdate=16 August 2018 |location=https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-119.htm |page=vii}}</ref>\n\n==Specifications==\n\n===Overall structure===\nThe following is the rough overall structure of the ISO 9660 file system:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | ISO 9660 File System\n|-\n| System Area (32,768 B)\n| ''Unused by ISO 9660''\n|-\n| rowspan=3 | Data Area\n|-\n| Volume Descriptor Set\n|-\n| Path tables, Directories and Files\n|}\n\nThe System Area, the first 32,768 data bytes of the disc (16 sectors of 2,048 bytes each), is unused by ISO 9660 and therefore available for other uses. For example, a CD-ROM may contain an alternative file system descriptor in this area, as it is often used by [[hybrid CD]]s to offer [[classic Mac OS]]-specific and [[macOS]]-specific content.\n\nAll multi-byte values are stored twice, in [[little-endian]] and [[big-endian]] format, either one-after-another in what the specification calls \"both-byte orders\", or in duplicated data structures such as the path table. As the structures have been designed with unaligned members, this \"both endian\" encoding does however not help implementors as the data structures need to be read byte-wise to convert them to properly aligned data.\n\n=== Volume descriptor set ===\nThe data area begins with a set of one or more ''volume descriptors'', terminated with a ''volume descriptor set terminator''. Collectively the ''volume descriptor set'' acts as a [[Header (computing)|header]] for the data area, describing its content (similar to the [[BIOS parameter block]] used by [[File Allocation Table|FAT]], [[High Performance File System|HPFS]] and [[NTFS]] formatted disks).\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Volume Descriptor Set\n|-\n| Volume Descriptor #1\n|-\n| ...\n|-\n| Volume Descriptor #N\n|-\n| Volume Descriptor Set Terminator\n|}\n\nThe ''volume descriptor set terminator'' is simply a particular type of ''volume descriptor'' with the purpose of marking the end of this set of structures.\n\n====Volume descriptor====\nEach volume descriptor is 2048 bytes in size, fitting perfectly into a single Mode 1 or Mode 2 Form 1 sector. They have the following structure:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! \n! colspan=4 | \u2190 2,048 bytes  \u2192\n|-\n! Parts\n| Type\n| Identifier (always 'CD001')\n| Version (always 0x01)\n| Data\n|-\n! Sizes\n| 1 byte\n| 5 bytes\n| 1 byte\n| 2,041 bytes\n|}\n\nThe data field of a volume descriptor may be subdivided into several fields, with the exact content depending on the type.\n\nStandard volume descriptor types are the following:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! colspan=2 | Basic Volume Descriptor Types\n|-\n! Type field value\n! Type\n|-\n| 0\n| Boot Record Volume Descriptor\n|-\n| 1\n| Primary Volume Descriptor\n|-\n| 2\n| Supplementary Volume Descriptor, or\nEnhanced Volume Descriptor\n|-\n| 3\n| Volume Partition Descriptor\n|-\n| 255\n| Volume Descriptor Set Terminator\n|}\n\nAn ISO 9660 compliant disc contains at least one ''Primary Volume Descriptor'' describing the  file system and a ''Volume Descriptor Set Terminator'' for indicating the end of the descriptor sequence.\n\nThe Primary Volume Descriptor provides information about the volume, characteristics and metadata, including a root directory record that indicates in which sector the root directory is located. Other fields contain the description or name of the volume, and information about who created it and with which application. The size of the logical blocks which the file system uses to segment the volume is also stored in a field inside the primary volume descriptor, as well as the amount of space occupied by the volume (measured in number of logical blocks).\n\nIn addition to the Primary Volume Descriptor(s), ''Supplementary Volume Descriptors'' or ''Enhanced Volume Descriptors'' may be present.\n\nSupplementary Volume Descriptors describe the same volume as the Primary Volume Descriptor does, and are normally used for providing additional code page support when the standard code tables are insufficient. The standard specifies that ISO 2022 is used for managing code sets that are wider than 8 bytes, and that ISO 2375 escape sequences are used to identify each particular code page used. Consequently, ISO 9660 supports international single-byte and multi-byte character sets, provided they fit into the framework of the referenced standards. However, ISO 9660 does not specify any code pages that are guaranteed to be supported: all use of code tables other than those defined in the standard itself are subject to agreement between the originator and the recipient of the volume.\n\nEnhanced Volume Descriptors were introduced in ISO 9660, Amendment 1.  They relax some of the requirements of the other volume descriptors and the directory records referenced by them: for example, the directory depth can exceed eight, file identifiers need not contain '.' or file version number, the length of a file and directory identifier is maximized to 207.\n\nRedundant copies of each volume descriptor can also be included in case the first copy of the descriptor becomes corrupt.\n\n===Directories and files===\n[[File:iso9660directoryTree.png|thumb|Overview of the ISO 9660 directory structure]]\n\nDirectory entries are stored following the location of the root directory entry, where evaluation of filenames is begun. Both directories and files are stored as [[Extent (file systems)|extents]], which are sequential series of sectors.\n\nFiles and directories are differentiated only by a file attribute that indicates its nature (similar to [[Unix]]). The attributes of a file are stored in the directory entry that describes the file, and optionally in the extended attribute record.\n\nTo locate a file, the directory names in the file's path can be checked sequentially, going to the location of each directory to obtain the location of the subsequent subdirectory. However, a file can also be located through the path table provided by the file system. This path table stores information about each directory, its parent, and its location on disc. Since the path table is stored in a contiguous region, it can be searched much faster than jumping to the particular locations of each directory in the file's path, thus reducing seek time.\n\nThe standard specifies three nested levels of interchange (paraphrased from section 10):\n* Level 1: File names are limited to eight characters with a three-character extension. Directory names are limited to eight characters. Files may contain one single file section.\n* Level 2: Files may contain one single file section.\n* Level 3: No additional restrictions than those stipulated in the main body of the standard. That is, directory identifiers may not exceed 31 characters in length, and file name + '.' + file name extension may not exceed 30 characters in length (sections 7.5 and 7.6). Files are also allowed to consist of multiple non-contiguous sections (with some restrictions as to order).\n\nAdditional restrictions in the body of the standard: The depth of the directory hierarchy must not exceed 8 (root directory being at level 1), and the path length of any file must not exceed 255. (section 6.8.2.1).\n\nThe standard also specifies the following name restrictions (sections 7.5 and 7.6):<ref name=\"ISO9660\" />\n* All levels restrict file names in the mandatory file hierarchy to upper case letters, digits, underscores (\"_\"), and a dot. (see also section 7.4.4 and Annex A), \n* If no characters are specified for the File Name then the File Name Extension shall consist of at least one character.  \n* If no characters are specified for the File Name Extension then the File Name shall consist of at least one character.\n* File names shall not have more than one dot. \n* Directory names shall not use dots at all.\n\n===Path tables===\nPath tables summarize the directory structure of the relevant directory hierarchy, providing only the directory identifier, the location of the extent in which the directory is recorded, the length of any extended attributes associated with the directory, and the index of its parent directory path table entry.\n\n==Limitations==\n\n===Directory depth limit===\nThe restrictions on filename length (8 characters plus 3 character extension for interchange level 1) and directory depth (8 levels, including the root directory<ref>ISO 9660, section 6.8.2.1</ref>) are a more serious limitation of the ISO 9660 file system.\n\nThe Rock Ridge extension works around the eight-directory depth limit by folding paths. In practice, however, few drivers and OSes care about the directory depth, so this rule is often ignored.\n\nIn addition to the restrictions mentioned above, a CD-ROM producer may choose one of the lower Levels of Interchange specified in chapter 10 of the standard, and further restrict file name length from 30 characters to only 8+3 in file identifiers, and 8 in directory identifiers in order to promote interchangeability with implementations that do not implement the full standard. (This is sometimes mistakenly interpreted as a restriction in the ISO 9660 standard itself.)\n\n===The 2/4 GiB file size limit===\nAll numbers in ISO 9660 file systems except the single byte value used for the GMT offset are unsigned numbers. As the length of a file's [[extent (file systems)|extent]] on disc is stored in a 32 bit value,<ref>ISO 9660 section 9.1.4</ref> it allows for a maximum length of just over 4.2 [[gigabyte|GB]] (more precisely, one byte less than 4 [[GiB]]). (Note: Some older operating systems may handle such values incorrectly (i.e. signed instead of unsigned), which would make it impossible to access files larger than 2 GB in size. The latter holds true also for operating systems without [[large file support]].)\n\nBased on this, it is often assumed that a file on an ISO 9660 formatted disc cannot be larger than 2<sup>32</sup>-1 in size, as the file's size is stored in an unsigned 32 bit value, for which 2<sup>32</sup>-1 is the maximum.\n\nIt is, however, possible to circumvent this limitation by using the multi-extent (fragmentation) feature of ISO 9660 Level 3 to create ISO 9660 file systems and single files up to 8 TiB. With this, files larger than 4 GiB can be split up into multiple extents (sequential series of sectors), each not exceeding the 4 GiB limit. For example, the free software such as [[InfraRecorder]], [[ImgBurn]] and [[mkisofs]] as well as [[Roxio Toast]] are able to create ISO 9660 file systems that use multi-extent files to store files larger than 4 GiB on appropriate media such as recordable DVDs.\n\nEmpirical tests with a 4.2 GB fragmented file on a DVD media have shown that Microsoft Windows XP supports this, while Mac OS X (as of 10.4.8) does not handle this case properly. In the case of Mac OS X, the driver appears not to support file fragmentation at all (i.e. it only supports ISO 9660 Level 2 but not Level 3). [[Linux]] supports multiple extents.<ref>[http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-bugs/2006-April/017786.html kern/95222: File sections on ISO9660 <nowiki>{{sic}}</nowiki> level 3 CDs ignored]</ref>\n\n===Limit on number of directories===\nAnother limitation is the number of directories. The ISO image has a structure called \"path table\". For each directory in the image, the path table provides the number of its parent directory entry. The problem is that the parent directory number is a 16-bit number, limiting its range from 1 to 65,535.<ref>ISO9660 sections 6.9 and 9.4.4</ref> The content of each directory is written also in a different place, making the path table redundant, and suitable only for fast searching.\n\nSome operating systems (e.g. Windows) use the path table, while others (e.g. Linux) do not. If an ISO image or disc consists of more than 65,535 directories, it will be readable in Linux, while in early Windows versions all files from the additional directories will be visible, but show up as empty (zero length).{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nSome software tools can have problems managing the path table if the directory limit is exceeded. A popular application using ISO format, ''[[mkisofs]]'', aborts if there is a path table overflow. [[Nero Burning ROM]] (for Windows) and Pinnacle Instant CD/DVD do not check whether the problem occurs, and will produce an invalid ISO file or disc without warning.\n\n==Extensions and improvements==\nThere are several extensions to ISO 9660 that relax some of its limitations. \n* [[Rock Ridge]] supports the preservation of POSIX (Unix-style) permissions and longer names.\n* [[Joliet (file system)|Joliet]] supports [[Unicode]] names stored in [[UCS-2]], thus allowing almost any character to be used, even from non-[[Latin script]]s.\n* [[El Torito (CD-ROM standard)|El Torito]] enables CDs to be bootable on [[IBM PC|PCs]].\n* [[Apple ISO 9660 Extensions]] adds support for [[classic Mac OS]]-specific and [[macOS]]-specific file characteristics such as [[resource fork]]s, file backup date and more.\n\nFor operating systems which do not support any extensions, a name translation file [[TRANS.TBL]] must be used. It should be located in every directory, including the root directory. This is now obsolete, since few such operating systems are in use today.\n\nThe [[ISO 13490]] standard is an extension to the ISO 9660 format that adds support for multiple [[Session (CD)|sessions]] on a disc. Since ISO 9660 is by design a read-only, pre-mastered file system, all the data has to be written in one go or \"session\" to the medium. Once written, there is no provision for altering the stored content. ISO 13490 was created to allow adding more files to a writeable disc such as [[CD-R]] in multiple sessions.\n\nThe ISO 13346/ECMA-167<ref>[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-167.pdf ECMA-167 - Volume and File Structure for Write-Once and Rewritable Media using Non-Sequential Recording for Information Interchange]</ref> standard was designed in conjunction to the ISO 13490 standard to address most of the shortcomings of ISO 9660,<ref>[http://www.standards.com/StandardsDownloads/birth.html Birth Announcement: ISO/IEC 13346 and ISO/IEC 13490]</ref> and a subset of it evolved into the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] format, which was  adopted for [[DVD]]s.\n\nJIS X 0606:1998, also known as ISO 9660:1999, is a Japanese Industrial Standard draft created by the Japanese National Body (JTC1 N4222) in order to make some improvements and remove some limitations from the original ISO 9660 standard.<ref>[http://www.pismotechnic.com/cfs/iso9660-1999.html JIS X 0606:1998 / ISO 9660:1999 Draft Specification]</ref> This draft was submitted in 1998, but it has not been ratified as an ISO standard yet. Some of its changes includes the removal of some restrictions imposed by the original standard by extending the maximum file name length to 207 characters, removing the eight-level maximum directory nesting limit, and removing the special meaning of the dot character in filenames. Some operating systems allow these relaxations as well when reading optical discs. Several disc authoring tools (such as [[Nero Burning ROM]], [[mkisofs]] and [[ImgBurn]]) support a so-called \"ISO 9660:1999\" mode (sometimes called \"ISO 9660 v2\" or \"ISO 9660 Level 4\" mode) that removes restrictions following the guidelines in the ISO 9660:1999 draft.\n\n==Disc images==\n{{Main|ISO image|Optical disc image}}\n\nISO 9660 file system images ([[ISO image]]s) are a common way to electronically transfer the contents of CD-ROMs. They often have the [[filename extension]] <code>.iso</code> (<code>.iso9660</code> is less common, but also in use) and are commonly referred to as \"ISOs\".\n\n==Operating system support==\nMost operating systems support reading of ISO 9660 formatted discs, and most new versions support the extensions such as [[Rock Ridge]] and [[Joliet (file system)|Joliet]]. Operating systems that do not support the extensions usually show the basic (non-extended) features of a plain ISO 9660 disc.\n\nOperating systems that support ISO 9660 and its extensions include the following:\n* [[DOS]]: access with extensions, such as [[MSCDEX|MSCDEX.EXE]] (Microsoft CDROM Extension), [[NWCDEX|NWCDEX.EXE]] or CORELCDX.EXE\n* Microsoft [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]], [[Windows ME]]: can read ISO 9660 Level 1, 2, 3, and [[Joliet (file system)|Joliet]]\n* Microsoft [[Windows NT 4.0]], [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows XP]], and newer Windows versions, can read ISO 9660 Level 1, 2, 3, [[Joliet (file system)|Joliet]], and ISO 9660:1999.

This can be done for a variety of reasons, including exercise, leisure, traveling, and various sports. Ice skating occurs both on specially prepared ice surfaces (arenas, tracks, parks), both [[Ice rink|indoors]] and outdoors, as well as on naturally occurring bodies of [[frozen water]], such as ponds, lakes and rivers.\n\n==History==\n===Early history of ice skating===\n[[File:SCENEONICE.jpg|left|thumb|''Skating fun'' by 17th century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]]]]\n\nResearch suggests that the earliest ice skating happened in southern [[Finland]] more than 4,000 years ago. This was done to save energy during winter journeys.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18447880 | title=The History and Science of Ice Skating }}</ref> Originally, skates were merely sharpened, flattened bone strapped to the bottom of the foot. Skaters did not actually skate on the ice, but rather glided on top of it.<ref name=formenti/>\n\nTrue skating emerged when a steel blade with sharpened edges was used. Skates now cut into the ice instead of gliding on top of it. Adding edges to [[ice skates]] was invented by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the 13th or 14th century. These ice skates were made of steel, with sharpened edges on the bottom to aid movement. \n \nThe construction of modern ice skates has stayed largely the same since then. In the [[Netherlands]], ice skating was considered proper for all classes of people, as shown in many pictures by the [[Old Master]]s.\n\nIce skating was also practiced in China during the [[Song dynasty]], and became popular among the ruling family of the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref name=pdo130220/>\n\n===Rising popularity and first clubs===\n[[File:The Skating Minister.jpg|thumb|''[[The Skating Minister]]'' by [[Henry Raeburn]], depicting a member of the [[Edinburgh Skating Club]] in the 1790s]]\nIce skating was brought to Britain from the Netherlands, where [[James II of England|James II]] was briefly exiled in the 17th century. When he returned to England, this 'new' sport was introduced to the British aristocracy, and was soon enjoyed by people from all walks of life.\n\nThe first organised [[figure skating club|skating club]] was the [[Edinburgh Skating Club]], formed in the 1740s, (some claim the club was established as early as 1642).<ref name=\"skating\">\"In The Beginning...\", ''Skating'' magazine, Jun 1970</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iceskating.org.uk/about/history |title=NISA History |publisher=Iceskating.org |accessdate=28 October 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922170520/http://www.iceskating.org.uk/about/history |archivedate=22 September 2008 |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0002794]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607152829/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=a1ARTA0002794 |date=June 7, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nAn early contemporary reference to the club appeared in the second edition (1783) of the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]:\n\n:The metropolis of Scotland has produced more instances of elegant skaters than perhaps any country whatever: and the institution of a skating club about 40 years ago has contributed not a little to the improvement of this elegant amusement.<ref name=\"skating\"/>\n\nFrom this description and others, it is apparent that the form of skating practiced by club members was indeed an early form of [[figure skating]] rather than [[speed skating]]. For admission to the club, candidates had to pass a skating test where they performed a complete circle on either foot (e.g., a [[compulsory figures|figure eight]]), and then jumped over first one hat, then two and three, placed over each other on the ice.<ref name=\"skating\"/>\n\nOn the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], participation in ice skating was limited to members of the upper classes. Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] enjoyed ice skating so much, he had a large ice carnival constructed in his court in order to popularise the sport. King [[Louis XVI]] of France brought ice skating to [[Paris]] during his reign. [[Madame de Pompadour]], [[Napoleon I]], [[Napoleon III]] and the [[House of Stuart]] were, among others, royal and upper class fans of ice skating.\n\n[[File:Glaciarium Ice Rink.jpg|thumb|230x230px|left|Interior of the ''[[Glaciarium]]'' in 1876]]\nThe next skating club to be established was in [[London]] and was not founded until 1830.<ref name=\"skating\"/> By the mid-19th century, ice skating was a popular pastime among the British upper and middle classes, ([[Queen Victoria]] got to know her future husband, [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], through a series of ice skating trips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.followthebrownsigns.com/ice-skating/|title=Ice Skating|publisher=Followthebrownsigns.com|accessdate=28 October 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028155237/http://www.followthebrownsigns.com/ice-skating/|archivedate=28 October 2014|df=}}</ref>) and early attempts at the construction of artificial ice rinks were made during the 'rink mania' of 1841-44. As the technology for the maintenance of natural ice did not exist, these early rinks used a substitute consisting of a mixture of hog's [[lard]] and various salts. An item in the 8 May 1844 issue of Littell's 'Living Age' headed the '[[Glaciarium]]' reported that \"This establishment, which has been removed to Grafton street East' [[Tottenham Court Road]], was opened on Monday afternoon. The area of artificial ice is extremely convenient for such as may be desirous of engaging in the graceful and manly pastime of skating\".\n\n===Emergence as a sport===\n[[File:Fenskaters ronden ton.jpg|thumb|right|19th century [[fen skating]]]]\nSkating became popular as a recreation, a means of transport and spectator sport in [[fen skating|The Fens]] in England for people from all walks of life.

The championship matches took the form of a Welsh main or \"last man standing\" contest. The competitors, 16 or sometimes 32, were paired off in heats and the winner of each heat went through to the next round. A course of 660 yards was measured out on the ice, and a barrel with a flag on it placed at either end. For a one-and-a-half mile race the skaters completed two rounds of the course, with three barrel turns.<ref name=\"Cycling, 19 January 1895, p 19\"/>\n\n[[File:Fen Runners.jpg|thumb|left|Fen runners]]\nIn the Fens skates were called [[Patten (shoe)#Other uses of the term|pattens]], fen runners, or [[Whittlesey]] runners. The footstock was made of [[beechwood]]. A screw at the back was screwed into the heel of the boot, and three small spikes at the front kept the skate steady. There were holes in the footstock for leather straps to fasten it to the foot. The metal blades were slightly higher at the back than the front. In the 1890s fen skaters started to race in Norwegian style skates.\n\nOn Saturday 1 February 1879, a number of professional ice skaters from [[Cambridgeshire]] and [[Huntingdonshire]] met in the Guildhall, Cambridge, to set up the [[National Ice Skating Association|National Skating Association]], the first national ice skating body in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iceskating.org.uk/node/6297|title=The History of Long Track Speed Skating|publisher=[[National Ice Skating Association|NISA]]|accessdate=28 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028175114/http://www.iceskating.org.uk/node/6297|archivedate=28 October 2014|df=}}</ref> The founding committee consisted of several landowners, a vicar, a fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], a magistrate, two Members of Parliament, the mayor of [[Cambridge]], the Lord Lieutenant of Cambridge, journalist James Drake Digby, the president of [[Cambridge University]] Skating Club, and Neville Goodman, a graduate of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]] (and son of [[Potto Brown]]'s milling partner, Joseph Goodman).<ref name=\"Bird\">DL Bird 1979 ''Our Skating Heritage''.

The book, written by a British artillery lieutenant, Robert Jones, describes basic [[figure skating]] forms such as circles and figure eights. The book was written solely for men, as women did not normally ice skate in the late 18th century. It was with the publication of this manual that ice skating split into its two main disciplines, speed skating and figure skating.\n\nThe founder of modern figure skating as it is known today was [[Jackson Haines]], an American. He was the first skater to incorporate ballet and dance movements into his skating, as opposed to focusing on tracing patterns on the ice. Haines also invented the [[sit spin]] and developed a shorter, curved blade for figure skating that allowed for easier turns. He was also the first to wear blades that were permanently attached to the boot.\n\n[[File:NSAPINY9 EXTR.jpg|thumb|230px|left|''[[Central Park]], Winter \u2013 The Skating Pond'', 1862 lithograph by [[Currier and Ives]]]]\n\nFor a time, the stiff and rigid British figure skating forms dominated in America, trumping Haines's more artistic way of skating. Haines instead attempted to spread his innovations in ice skating style in Europe, gaining success in such countries as Sweden and Austria. His style was still opposed by both his American colleagues as well as skaters from [[Victorian era|Victorian England]], who continued to advocate a stiffer and more restrained style of skating. Haines continued to add new dance elements to his routines, and astounded a crowd in [[Vienna]] in the winter of 1868. Many in the audience expressed wonder at how a normal man could move over the ice in such a manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Haines's performance led to the establishment of the Vienna School, which continued to develop Haines's artistic style.\n\nThe [[International Skating Union]] was founded in 1892 as the first international ice skating organization in [[Scheveningen]], in the Netherlands. The Union created the first codified set of figure skating rules and governed international competition in speed and figure skating. The first Championship, known as the Championship of the Internationale Eislauf-Vereingung, was held in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1896. The event had four competitors and was won by [[Gilbert Fuchs]].<ref>Hines, p.75</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Physics}} Physical mechanics of skating==\n\nA skate can glide over ice because there is a layer of ice molecules at the surface that are not as tightly bound as the molecules of the mass of ice beneath.  These molecules are in a semiliquid state, providing lubrication. The molecules in this \"quasi-fluid\" or \"water-like\" layer are less mobile than liquid water, but are much more mobile than the molecules deeper in the ice. At about {{convert|-250|F}} the slippery layer is one molecule thick; as the temperature increases the slippery layer becomes thicker.<ref name=nyt060221/><ref name=SS97/><ref name=PPG121223/><ref name=explorat/><ref name=SN9612/>\n\nIt had long been believed that ice is slippery because the pressure of an object in contact with it causes a thin layer to melt. The hypothesis was that the blade of an ice skate, exerting pressure on the ice, melts a thin layer, providing lubrication between the ice and the blade. This explanation, called \"pressure melting\", originated in the 19th century. This, however, did not account for skating on ice temperatures lower than \u22123.5&nbsp;\u00b0C, whereas skaters often skate on lower-temperature ice. In the 20th century, an alternative explanation, called \"friction heating\", was proposed, whereby friction of the material was causing the ice layer melting. However, this theory also failed to explain skating at low temperature. In fact, neither explanation explained why ice is slippery when standing still even at below-zero temperatures.<ref name=PT0512/>\n\n==Safety==\n[[File:Ice Skating (12).jpg|thumb|250px|Adult and child ice skating]]\n\nSkating depends on the roughness of the ice, the design of the ice skate, and the skill and experience of the skater. While serious injury is rare, a number of [[Short track speed skating|short track]] skaters have been [[paralysis|paralysed]] after a fall when they hit the boarding. Falling can be fatal if a [[helmet]] is not worn to protect against serious [[head trauma]]. Accidents are rare but most common with collisions, hockey games, or [[pair skating]].\n\nThe second, and more serious, danger is falling through the ice into the freezing water underneath when skating outdoors on a frozen body of water. Death can occur due to [[Cold shock response|shock]], [[hypothermia]] or [[drowning]]. It is often difficult or impossible for skaters to climb out of the water back onto the ice due to the ice repeatedly breaking, the skater being weighed down by skates and thick winter clothing, or the skater becoming disoriented under water. The skater may even not be able to find the hole through which they fell. This may result in drowning or hypothermia, but the rapid cooling can also create a state in which someone can be revived up to hours after having fallen in the water.\n\n==Communal games on ice==\nA number of recreational skating games are played on ice.\n\n* [[Ice hockey]]\n* [[Speed skating]]\n* [[Figure skating]]\n* [[Bandy]]\n* [[Rink bandy]]\n* [[Ringette]]\n* [[Tour skating]]\n* [[Ice cross downhill]]\n* [[Barrel jumping]]<ref>{{cite web|title=World Barrel Jumping Championships 1958|url=http://www.britishpathe.com/video/world-barrel-jumping-championships|publisher=British Path\u00e9|accessdate=7 December 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202211/http://www.britishpathe.com/video/world-barrel-jumping-championships|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Pictures==\n<gallery>\nImage:Bandy game 1.jpg|[[Bandy]]\nImage:Kim 2010 Olympic FS.jpg|[[Figure skating]]\nImage:Stephen Weiss.jpg|[[Ice hockey]]\nImage:RingettePlayer.jpg|[[Ringette]]\nImage:Saguenay 500m.jpg|[[Short track speed skating|Short track]]\nImage:Langfardsskridskoakning.jpg|[[Tour skating]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Videos==\n<gallery>\nFile:Eislaufen 01.ogg|Ice skater on [[Lake Neusiedl]].\nFile:Skating in Central Park Frank-S.-Armitage-American-Mutoscope-And-Biograph-1900.ogv|thumbtime=0:11|''Skating in Central Park'' (1900), one minute silent film by Frank S.

More recent research has shown, though, that this property isn't why skaters can slide on the ice... It turns out that at the very surface of the ice, water molecules exist in a state somewhere between a pure liquid and a pure solid. ''It's not exactly water -- but it's like water. The atoms in this layer are 100,000 times more mobile than the atoms [deeper] in the ice, but they're still 25 times less mobile than atoms in water.

Created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]] and [[Demetrios Vikelas]] in 1894, it is the authority responsible for organising the modern [[Olympic Games]].<ref>Roger Bartlett, Chris Gratton, Christer G. Rolf ''Encyclopedia of International Sports Studies''. Routledge, 2012, p. 678</ref>\n\nThe IOC is the controlling body for the [[National Olympic Committee]]s (NOCs), which are the national constituents of the worldwide Olympic Movement. As of 2016, there are 206 NOCs officially recognised by the IOC.\n\n==History==\nThe IOC was created by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], on 23 June 1894 with [[Demetrios Vikelas]] as its first president. As of June 2017, its membership consists of 95 active members, 41 honorary members, an honorary president ([[Jacques Rogge]]) and one honour member ([[Henry Kissinger]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=IOC Members List|url=https://www.olympic.org/ioc-members-list|accessdate=15 June 2017}}</ref> The IOC is the supreme authority of the worldwide modern Olympic movement.\n\nThe IOC organises the modern [[Olympic Games]] and [[Youth Olympic Games]], held in summer and winter, every four years. The first [[Summer Olympics]] organised by the IOC was held in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]]; the first [[Winter Olympics]] was in [[Chamonix]], [[France]], in [[1924 Winter Olympics|1924]]. Until 1992, both Summer and Winter Olympics were held in the same year. After that year, however, the IOC shifted the Winter Olympics to the even years between Summer Games, to help space the planning of the two events from one another, and improve the financial balance of the IOC, which receives greater income on Olympic years. The first Summer Youth Olympics were in [[Singapore]] in [[2010 Summer Youth Olympics|2010]] and the first Winter Youth Olympics were held in [[Innsbruck]] in [[2012 Winter Youth Olympics|2012]].\n\nIn 2009, the [[UN General Assembly]] granted the IOC Permanent Observer status. This decision enables the IOC to be directly involved in the UN Agenda and to attend UN General Assembly meetings where it can take the floor. This has provided the possibility to promote sport at a new level. In addition, in 1993, the UN General Assembly approved a Resolution that further solidified IOC\u2013UN cooperation with the decision to revive the [[Olympic Truce]], by adopting a Resolution entitled \"Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal,\" which calls upon [[Member States]] to observe the Olympic Truce before every iteration of the Olympic Games, and to cooperate with the IOC and the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) in their efforts to use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and reconciliation in areas of conflict during and beyond the period of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympic.org/cooperation-with-the-un|title=Cooperation With The UN|date=21 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDuring each proclamation at the Olympics, announcers speak in different languages, French is always spoken first followed by an English translation and the dominant language of the host nation.\n\n==Mission and roles==\n{{Further information|Olympic Charter}}\n\nThe stated mission of the IOC is to promote the [[Olympic Games|Olympics]] throughout the world and to lead the Olympic Movement.<ref name=Charter>{{cite web | url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/olympic_charter_en.pdf | title=Chapter 2: Mission and Role of the IOC | publisher=IOC | work=Olympic Charter | date=8 July 2011 | accessdate=29 July 2012 | pages=14\u201315}}</ref>\n\n* To encourage and support the organisation, development and coordination of sport and sports competitions;\n* To ensure the regular celebration of the Olympic Games;\n* To cooperate with the competent public or private organisations and authorities in the endeavour to place sport at the service of humanity and thereby to promote peace;\n* To act against any form of discrimination affecting the Olympic Movement;\n* To encourage and support the promotion of women in sport at all levels and in all structures with a view to implementing the principle of equality of men and women;\n\n==IOC Executive Board==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The IOC distributes TOP programme revenue to each of the NOCs throughout the world. The IOC also contributes Olympic broadcast revenue to Olympic Solidarity, an IOC organisation that provides financial support to NOCs with the greatest need.\n\nThe continued success of the TOP programme and Olympic broadcast agreements has enabled the IOC to provide increased support for the NOCs with each Olympic quadrennium. The IOC provided approximately US$318.5&nbsp;million to NOCs for the 2001\u20132004 quadrennium.\n\n===International Olympic Sports Federations===\nThe IOC is now the largest single revenue source for the majority of [[List of international sports federations|IFs]], with its contributions of Olympic broadcast revenue that assist the IFs in the development of their respective sports worldwide. The IOC provides financial support from Olympic broadcast revenue to the 28 IFs of Olympic summer sports and the seven IFs of Olympic winter sports after the completion of the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics, respectively.\n\nThe continually increasing value of Olympic broadcast partnership has enabled the IOC to deliver substantially increased financial support to the IFs with each successive Games. The seven winter sports IFs shared US$85.8&nbsp;million, \u20ac75 million in Salt Lake 2002 broadcast revenue. The contribution to the 28 summer sports IFs from Athens 2004 broadcast revenue has not yet been determined, but the contribution is expected to mark a significant increase over the US$190&nbsp;million, \u20ac150 million that the IOC provided to the summer IFs following Sydney 2000.\n\n===Other organisations===\nThe IOC contributes Olympic marketing revenue to the programmes of various recognised international sports organisations, including the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC), and the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] (WADA).\n\n==The Olympic Partner programme==\nThe Olympic Partner (TOP) sponsorship programme includes the following commercial sponsors of the Olympic Games.\n* [[Coca-Cola]]\n* [[Allianz]]\n* [[Alibaba Group]]\n* [[Atos]]\n* [[Bridgestone]]\n* [[Dow Chemical Company]]\n* [[General Electric]]\n* [[Intel]]\n* [[Omega SA]] (previously [[The Swatch Group]], its parent company)\n* [[Panasonic]]\n* [[Procter & Gamble]]\n* [[Samsung]]\n* [[Toyota]]\n* [[Visa Inc.]]\n\n==Environmental concerns==\nThe IOC recognizes that the Olympic Games demand substantial environmental resources, activities, and construction projects that could be detrimental to a host city's environment.<ref name=Jin2008{{>Jin Y, Zhang JJ, Ma X, Connaughton DP.

First, the IOC Sustainability and Legacy Commission focuses on how the IOC can improve the strategies and policies associated with environmental health throughout the process of cities hosting the Olympic Games.<ref>https://www.olympic.org/sustainability-and-legacy-commission</ref> Secondly, every candidate city must provide information to the IOC on environmental health issues like air quality and environmental impact assessments. Thirdly, every host city is given the option to declare \"pledges\" to address specific or general environmental health concerns of hosting the Olympic Game. Fourthly, the IOC has every host city collaborate with the United Nations to work towards addressing environmental health objectives.<ref>http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44575.pdf</ref> Ultimately, the IOC uses these four major approaches in an attempt to minimize the negative environmental health concerns of a host city.\n\n===Venue construction effects on air===\nCities hosting the Olympic Games have two primary concerns: traffic congestion and air pollution, both of which can result in compromised air quality during and after Olympic venue construction.<ref name=\"Qiao Q 2011\">Qiao Q, Zhang C, Huang B, Piper JDA.

Black Carbon is released into the air from incomplete combustion of carbonaceous fluids contributing to global climate change and human health effects. The black carbon concentrations are highly impacted by the truck traffic due to the traffic congestion during the massive construction. Additionally, secondary pollutants like [[Carbon monoxide|CO]], [[NOx]], [[Sulfur dioxide|SO2]], [[benzene]], [[toluene]], [[ethylbenzene]], and [[xylenes]] (BTEX) are also released during the venue construction, resulting in harmful effects to the environment.<ref>Wang T et. al. (2010). Air quality during the 2008 Beijing Olympics: secondary pollutants and regional impact. Atmos. Chem. Phys. Vol. 10; 7603\u20137615.</ref>\n\n====Methods to measure particulates in the air====\nEnvironmental magnetic methods have been established as a successful way of measuring the degree of pollution in air, water and soil. Environmental magnetism is sensitive to particle size, and has proven effective even at low detection levels. For these reasons, it is becoming more widely used.\n\n====Measures taken to improve air quality====\nVarious [[air quality]] measures are undertaken before and after the Olympic Games. Research studies demonstrate that the primary method to reduce concentrations of air pollutants is traffic control, including barring heavy vehicles from the roads. For the Beijing Olympics, vehicles not meeting the Euro 1 emission standards were also banned from the roads, and the odd-even rule was implemented in the Beijing administrative area. Additional air quality improvement measures include replacing coal with natural gas, suspending construction and/or imposing strict dust control on construction sites, closing or relocating the polluting industrial plants, building long subway lines, using cleaner fluid in power plants, and reducing the activity by some of the polluting factories. These were several air quality improvement measures implemented by the Beijing government. There, levels of primary and secondary pollutants were reduced, and good air quality was recorded during the Beijing Olympics on most of the days.\n\n===Venue construction effects on soil===\n[[Soil contamination]] can occur during the process of constructing the Olympic venues. In the case of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, negative environmental impacts were observed, including impacts on soil. Before the Games, researchers studied four areas which the Games would likely affect: a floodplain, a highway, the motorway connecting the city to Lyon, France, and a landfill. They performed an extensive analysis in the types of chemicals found in the soils in these areas both before and after the Games. Their findings revealed an increase in the number of metals in the topsoils post-Games, and indicated that soil was capable, as part of an ecosystem, of negating, or \"buffering,\" the effects of many heavy metals. However, their findings also revealed that this was not the case for all metals, and that mercury, lead, and arsenic may have been transferred into the food chain on a massive scale.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Soil Heavy Metals Patterns in the Torino Olympic Winter Games Venue (E.U.)|url=https://zenodo.org/record/848903|journal=Soil and Sediment Contamination|pages=205\u2013220|volume=17|issue=3|doi=10.1080/15320380802006905}}</ref>\nOne of the promises made to Londoners when they won the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games was that the Olympic Park would be a \"blueprint for sustainable living.\" However, residents of the allotments of Manor Road were relocated, due to the building of the Olympic stadium, and would later disagree that the Olympics had had any positive effect on their lives. Allotments, originally, were intended to provide low-income residents with a plot of land on which to grow their own food, thus receiving the dual health benefits of a supply of fresh food and outdoor work. Many of these sites were lost as a result of the Olympic venue construction, most notably the Manor Road site. Residents were promised that the allotments would be returned, and they eventually were. However, the soil quality would never be the same. Crops tended by allotment residents were the result of years of careful cultivation, and thus, those years of care and attention were destroyed by a bulldozer. Further, allotment residents were exposed to radioactive waste for five months prior to moving, during the excavation of the site for the Games. Other local residents, construction workers, and onsite archeologists faced similar exposures and risks.<ref>Sadd D. (2012). Not all Olympic 'events' are good for the health just ask the previous occupants of the Manor Road. Allotments Perspectives in Public Health. Vol. 132; 2, 62\u201363.[SIC]</ref>\nIn contrast, the Sydney Olympic Games of 2000 provided an opportunity to improve a highly contaminated area known as the Homebush Bay site. A study commissioned by the New South Wales Government Olympic Coordination Authority, which was responsible for the Games' site preparation, looked at soil contamination prior to the Games. The work assessed soils that had been previously impacted by waste and identified areas that could pose a risk to the environment. Soil metal concentrations were found to be high enough to potentially contaminate groundwater. After risk areas were identified, a remediation strategy was developed. Contaminated soil was consolidated into four containment areas within the site, which left the remaining areas available for recreational use. Also, the contained waste materials no longer posed a threat to surrounding aquifers. Sydney's winning Olympic bid provided a catalyst to undertake the \"greenest\" single urban remediation ever attempted in Australia.<ref>Suh J-Y, Birch G. F., Hughes K., Matthai C. (2004) Spatial distribution and source of heavy metals in reclaimed lands of Homebush Bay: the venue of the 2000 Olympic Games, Sydney, New South Wales. Australian Journal of Earth Sciences. Vol. 51: 53\u201366.</ref>\n\n===Venue construction effects on water===\nThe Olympic Games can affect water quality in the surrounding region in several ways, including water runoff and the transfer of polluting substances from the air to water sources through rainfall. Harmful particulates come from both natural substances (such as plant matter crushed by higher volumes of pedestrian and vehicle traffic) and man-made substances (such as exhaust from vehicles or industry). Contaminants from these two categories lead to elevated amounts of toxins in street dust. Street dust then reaches water sources through runoff, facilitating the transfer of toxins to environments and communities that rely on these water sources.<ref name=\"Qiao Q 2011\"/> For example, one method of measuring the runoff contamination of water sources involves magnetism. Magnetism measurement systems allow specialists to measure the differences in mineral magnetic parameters in samples of water, air, and vegetation. Unlike traditional methods of measuring pollutants, magnetism is relatively inexpensive, and can identify smaller particle sizes.<ref>Qiao, 1223.</ref>\nAnother method used to assess the amount and effects of water pollutants is to measure the amount of PM2.5 in rainfall. Measuring PM2.5 (the amount of aerodynamic diameter of particle\u22642.5 \u03bcm in a given amount of air) is a common metric for assessing air quality. Comparing PM2.5 levels between air and rainfall samples allows scientists to determine the amount of air pollution being transferred to water sources. Pollutants in rainfall quickly and directly affect pollution in groundwater sources.<ref>Ouyang W et. al. The washing effect of precipitation on particulate matter and the pollution dynamics of rainwater in downtown Beijing. Science of the Total Environment. Vol. 505; 306\u2013314. 1 February 2015.</ref> In 2013, researchers in Beijing found a significant relationship between the amount of PM2.5 concentrations in the air and in rainfall. Studies showed that rainfall had a significant \"washing\" effect on PM2.5 in the air, transferring a large portion of these pollutants from the air to water sources.<ref>Ouyang W. 313.</ref> In this way, Beijing's notorious air pollution has a direct and significant impact on rainfall, and therefore, on water resources throughout the region.\n\n==Controversies==\n{{Olympic Games infobox}}\n\n===Amateurism and professionalism===\n{{main article|Olympic Games#Amateurism and professionalism}}\n\n[[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the IOC, was influenced by the ethos of the aristocracy as exemplified in the [[Independent school (UK)|English public schools]].<ref name=OIdeology>{{cite book |last=Eassom |first=Simon |title=Critical Reflections on Olympic Ideology |year=1994 |location=Ontario |publisher=The Centre for Olympic Studies |pages=120\u2013123 |isbn=0-7714-1697-0}}</ref> The public schools subscribed to the belief that sport formed an important part of education and there was a prevailing concept of fairness in which practicing or training was considered cheating.<ref name=OIdeology/> As class structure evolved through the 20th century, the definition of the amateur athlete as an aristocratic gentleman became outdated.<ref name=OIdeology/> The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage.

[[Avery Brundage]], president of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, was opposed to the idea of amateur and professional players competing together.

The integration of large numbers of tiny [[transistor]]s into a small chip results in circuits that are orders of magnitude smaller, cheaper, and faster than those constructed of discrete [[electronic component]]s. The IC's [[mass production]] capability, reliability and building-block approach to [[Integrated circuit design|circuit design]] has ensured the rapid adoption of standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors.  ICs are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have revolutionized the world of [[electronics]]. [[Computer]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, and other digital [[home appliance]]s are now inextricable parts of the structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and low cost of ICs.\n\nIntegrated circuits were made practical by mid-20th-century technology advancements in [[semiconductor device fabrication]].  Since their origins in the 1960s, the size, speed, and capacity of chips have progressed enormously, driven by technical advances that fit more and more transistors on chips of the same size\u2014a modern chip may have many billions of [[transistor]]s in an area the size of a human fingernail.  These advances, roughly following [[Moore's law]], make computer chips of today possess millions of times the capacity and thousands of times the speed of the computer chips of the early 1970s.\n\nICs have two main advantages over [[discrete circuit]]s: cost and performance. Cost is low because the chips, with all their components, are printed as a unit by [[photolithography]] rather than being constructed one transistor at a time. Furthermore, packaged ICs use much less material than discrete circuits. Performance is high because the IC's components switch quickly and consume comparatively little power because of their small size and close proximity.  The main disadvantage of ICs is the high cost to [[Integrated circuit design|design]] them and [[Semiconductor device fabrication|fabricate]] the required [[photomask]]s.  This high initial cost means ICs are only practical when [[Economies of scale|high production volumes]] are anticipated.\n\n== Terminology ==\nAn ''integrated circuit'' is defined as:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jedec.org/standards-documents/dictionary/terms/integrated-circuit-ic |title=Integrated circuit (IC) |publisher=[[JEDEC]]}}</ref> <blockquote>A circuit in which all or some of the circuit elements are inseparably associated and electrically interconnected so that it is considered to be indivisible for the purposes of construction and commerce.</blockquote>  Circuits meeting this definition can be constructed using many different technologies, including [[thin-film transistor]]s, [[Thick-film technology|thick-film technologies]], or [[hybrid integrated circuit]]s. However, in general usage ''integrated circuit'' has come to refer to the single-piece circuit construction originally known as a ''monolithic integrated circuit''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The first monolithic integrated circuits |url=http://homepages.nildram.co.uk/~wylie/ICs/monolith.htm |quote=Nowadays when people say 'integrated circuit' they usually mean a monolithic IC, where the entire circuit is constructed in a single piece of silicon. |author=Andrew Wylie |year=2009 |accessdate=14 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last1 = Horowitz| first1 = Paul| authorlink1 = Paul Horowitz| last2 = Hill| first2 = Winfield| authorlink2 = Winfield Hill| title = The Art of Electronics| edition = 2nd| year = 1989| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 0-521-37095-7| page = 61| quote = Integrated circuits, which have largely replaced circuits constructed from discrete transistors, are themselves merely arrays of transistors and other components built from a single chip of semiconductor material. }}</ref>\n\nArguably, the first examples of integrated circuits would include the [[Loewe 3NF]].<ref>https://www.radiomuseum.org/tubes/tube_3nf.html</ref> Although far from a monolithic construction, it certainly meets the definition given above.\n\n== Invention ==\n{{Main|Invention of the integrated circuit}}\nEarly developments of the integrated circuit go back to 1949, when German engineer [http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/who-invented-the-ic/ Werner Jacobi] ([[Siemens AG|Siemens&nbsp;AG]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://integratedcircuithelp.com/invention.htm |title=Integrated circuits help Invention |publisher=Integratedcircuithelp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}</ref> filed a patent for an integrated-circuit-like semiconductor amplifying device<ref name=\"jacobi1949\">{{patent|DE|833366|W.

Jacobi disclosed small and cheap [[hearing aid]]s as typical industrial applications of his patent. An immediate commercial use of his patent has not been reported.\n\nThe idea of the integrated circuit was conceived by [[Geoffrey Dummer]] (1909\u20132002), a radar scientist working for the [[Royal Radar Establishment]] of the British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. Dummer presented the idea to the public at the Symposium on Progress in Quality Electronic Components in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington,&nbsp;D.C.]] on 7 May 1952.<ref>[http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html \"The Hapless Tale of Geoffrey Dummer\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511181443/http://www.epn-online.com/page/22909/the-hapless-tale-of-geoffrey-dummer-this-is-the-sad-.html |date=11 May 2013 }}, (n.d.), (HTML), ''Electronic Product News'', accessed 8 July 2008.</ref> He gave many symposia publicly to propagate his ideas and unsuccessfully attempted to build such a circuit in 1956.\n\nA precursor idea to the IC was to create small ceramic squares (wafers), each containing a single miniaturized component. Components could then be integrated and wired into a bidimensional or tridimensional compact grid. This idea, which seemed very promising in 1957, was proposed to the US Army by [[Jack Kilby]] and led to the short-lived Micromodule Program (similar to 1951's [[Project Tinkertoy]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/milestones/kilby.html|title=Micromodules: the ultimate package|last=Rostky|first=George|date=|website=EE Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107111717/http://www.eetimes.com/special/special_issues/millennium/milestones/kilby.html|archive-date=2010-01-07|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chipsetc.com/the-rca-micromodule.html|title=The RCA Micromodule|website=Vintage Computer Chip Collectibles, Memorabilia & Jewelry|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdCjBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA394&dq=circuity%20micromodular%20construction&hl=en&pg=PA392#v=onepage&q=micromodule&f=false|title=American Microelectronics Data Annual 1964\u201365|last=Dummer|first=G.

The technology was developed by Italian physicist [[Federico Faggin]] in 1968. In 1970, he joined [[Intel]] in order to develop the first single-chip [[central processing unit]] (CPU) [[microprocessor]], the [[Intel 4004]], for which he received the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]] in 2010. The 4004 was designed by [[Busicom]]'s [[Masatoshi Shima]] and Intel's [[Ted Hoff]] in 1969, but it was Faggin's improved design in 1970 that made it a reality.<ref name=\"ieee\">[[Federico Faggin]], [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4776530 The Making of the First Microprocessor], ''IEEE Solid-State Circuits Magazine'', Winter 2009, [[IEEE Xplore]]</ref>\n\n== Advances ==\nAdvances in IC technology, primarily smaller features and larger chips, have allowed the number of transistors in an integrated circuit to double every two years, a trend known as [[Moore's law]]. This increased capacity has been used to decrease cost and increase functionality.  In general, as the feature size shrinks, almost every aspect of an IC's operation improves.  The cost per transistor and the [[low-power electronics|switching power consumption]] per transistor goes down, while the [[Computer memory|memory capacity]] and [[clock rate|speed]] go up, through the relationships defined by [[Dennard scaling]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Davari, Bijan, Robert H.

The success of ICs has led to the integration of other technologies, in an attempt to obtain the same advantages of small size and low cost. These technologies include mechanical devices, optics, and sensors.\n* [[Charge-coupled device]]s, and the closely related [[active pixel sensor]]s, are chips that are sensitive to light.  They have largely replaced [[photographic film]] in scientific, medical, and consumer applications.  Billions of these devices are now produced each year for applications such as cellphones, tablets, and digital cameras.

The small size of these circuits allows high speed, low power dissipation, and reduced [[manufacturing cost]] compared with board-level integration. These digital ICs, typically [[microprocessor]]s, [[Digital signal processor|DSPs]], and [[microcontroller]]s, work using [[boolean algebra]] to process [[Binary number|\"one\" and \"zero\" signals]].\n\n[[File:Intel 8742 153056995.jpg|right|thumb|The [[die (integrated circuit)|die]] from an Intel [[Intel MCS-48|8742]], an 8-bit [[microcontroller]] that includes a [[CPU]] running at 12&nbsp;MHz, 128 bytes of [[RAM]], 2048 bytes of [[EPROM]], and [[Input/output|I/O]] in the same chip]]\nAmong the most advanced integrated circuits are the [[microprocessor]]s or \"'''[[Processor core|cores]]'''\", which control everything from personal computers and cellular phones to digital [[microwave oven]]s. Digital [[Computer memory|memory chips]] and [[application-specific integrated circuit]]s (ASICs) are examples of other families of integrated circuits that are important to the modern [[information society]].\n\nIn the 1980s, [[programmable logic device]]s were developed. These devices contain circuits whose logical function and connectivity can be programmed by the user, rather than being fixed by the integrated circuit manufacturer. This allows a single chip to be programmed to implement different LSI-type functions such as [[logic gate]]s, [[adder (electronics)|adders]] and [[processor register|registers]]. Current devices called [[field-programmable gate array]]s (FPGAs) can (as of 2016) implement the equivalent of millions of gates [[Parallel computing|in parallel]] and operate at [[Clock rate|frequencies]] up to 1 [[Hertz|GHz]].<ref name=\"Altera\">{{cite news\n|url = https://www.altera.com/en_US/pdfs/literature/hb/stratix-10/s10-overview.pdf\n|title = Stratix 10 Device Overview\n|work = [[Altera]]\n|date = 12 December 2015\n|accessdate = 18 Nov 2016\n}}</ref>\n\nAnalog ICs, such as [[sensor]]s, [[power network design (IC)|power management circuits]], and [[operational amplifier]]s (op-amps), work by processing [[continuous signal]]s.  They perform functions like [[Amplifier|amplification]], [[active filter]]ing, [[demodulation]], and [[Frequency mixer|mixing]].  Analog ICs ease the burden on circuit designers by having expertly designed analog circuits available instead of designing a difficult analog circuit from scratch.\n\nICs can also combine analog and digital circuits on a single chip to create functions such as [[analog-to-digital converter]]s and [[digital-to-analog converter]]s. Such mixed-signal circuits offer smaller size and lower cost, but must carefully account for signal interference.  Prior to the late 1990s, radios could not be fabricated in the same low-cost CMOS processes as microprocessors. But since 1998, a large number of radio chips have been developed using CMOS processes.

It also shows the section for [[FEOL]] (front-end of line), [[BEOL]] (back-end of line) and first parts of back-end process.]]\n\nThe [[semiconductor]]s of the [[periodic table]] of the [[chemical element]]s were identified as the most likely materials for a ''[[Solid-state electronics|solid-state]] [[vacuum tube]]''. Starting with [[copper(I) oxide|copper oxide]], proceeding to [[germanium]], then [[silicon]], the materials were systematically studied in the 1940s and 1950s. Today, [[monocrystalline silicon]] is the main [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]] used for ICs although some III-V compounds of the periodic table such as [[gallium arsenide]] are used for specialized applications like [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]], [[laser]]s, [[solar cell]]s and the highest-speed integrated circuits. It took decades to perfect methods of creating [[crystal]]s without [[Crystal defects|defects]] in semiconducting materials' [[crystal structure]].\n\n[[Semiconductor]] ICs are fabricated in a [[planar process]] which includes three key process steps{{snd}} [[Industrial process imaging|imaging]], [[Chemical vapor deposition|deposition]] and [[Etching (microfabrication)|etching]].  The main process steps are supplemented by doping and cleaning.\n\n[[Monocrystalline silicon|Mono-crystal silicon]] [[wafer (electronics)|wafers]] (or for special applications, [[silicon on sapphire]] or gallium arsenide wafers) are used as the ''substrate''. [[Photolithography]] is used to mark different areas of the substrate to be [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped]] or to have polysilicon, insulators or metal (typically aluminium or copper) tracks deposited on them. [[Dopant]]s are impurities intentionally introduced to a semiconductor to modulate its electromagnetic properties. Doping is the process of adding dopants to a semiconductor material.\n* Integrated circuits are composed of many overlapping layers, each defined by photolithography, and normally shown in different colors. Some layers mark where various dopants are diffused into the substrate (called diffusion layers), some define where additional ions are implanted (implant layers), some define the conductors (polysilicon or metal layers), and some define the connections between the conducting layers (via or contact layers). All components are constructed from a specific combination of these layers.\n* In a self-aligned [[CMOS]] process, a [[transistor]] is formed wherever the gate layer (polysilicon or metal) crosses a diffusion layer.\n* [[capacitor|Capacitive structures]], in form very much like the [[Parallel-plate capacitor|parallel conducting plates]] of a traditional electrical [[capacitor]], are formed according to the area of the \"plates\", with insulating material between the plates. Capacitors of a wide range of sizes are common on ICs.\n* Meandering stripes of varying lengths are sometimes used to form on-chip [[resistor]]s, though most [[logic circuit]]s do not need any resistors. The ratio of the length of the resistive structure to its width, combined with its sheet resistivity, determines the resistance.\n* More rarely, [[inductor|inductive structures]] can be built as tiny on-chip coils, or simulated by [[gyrator]]s.\n\nSince a CMOS device only draws current on the ''[[State transition function|transition]]'' between [[boolean algebra (logic)|logic]] [[State (computer science)|states]], CMOS devices consume much less current than [[bipolar junction transistor]] devices.\n\nA [[random-access memory]] is the most regular type of integrated circuit; the highest density devices are thus memories; but even a [[microprocessor]] will have memory on the chip. (See the regular array structure at the bottom of the first image.{{Which|date=October 2018}}) Although the structures are intricate \u2013 with widths which have been shrinking for decades \u2013 the layers remain much thinner than the device widths. The layers of material are fabricated much like a photographic process, although light [[wave]]s in the [[visible spectrum]] cannot be used to \"expose\" a layer of material, as they would be too large for the features. Thus [[photon]]s of higher frequencies (typically [[ultraviolet]]) are used to create the patterns for each layer. Because each feature is so small, [[electron microscope]]s are essential tools for a [[Industrial processes|process]] engineer who might be [[debugging]] a fabrication process.\n\nEach device is tested before packaging using automated test equipment (ATE), in a process known as [[wafer testing]], or wafer probing. The wafer is then cut into rectangular blocks, each of which is called a ''[[die (integrated circuit)|die]]''. Each good die (plural ''dice'', ''dies'', or ''die'') is then connected into a package using [[aluminium]] (or gold) [[Wire bonding|bond wires]] which are [[Thermosonic bonding|thermosonically bonded]]<ref>Coucoulas, A., http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hot_Work_Ultrasonic_(Thermosonic)_Bonding_549-556.pdf [https://sites.google.com/site/hotworkultrasonicbonding/ \"Hot Work Ultrasonic Bonding \u2013 A Method Of Facilitating Metal Flow By Restoration Processes\"], Proc. 20th IEEE Electronic Components Conf.

[[Thermosonic bonding]] was first introduced by A. Coucoulas which provided a reliable means of forming these vital electrical  connections to the outside world. After packaging, the devices go through final testing on the same or similar ATE used during wafer probing.  [[Industrial CT scanning]] can also be used. Test cost can account for over 25% of the cost of fabrication on lower-cost products, but can be negligible on low-yielding, larger, or higher-cost devices.\n\n{{As of|2016}}, a [[Semiconductor fabrication plant|fabrication facility]] (commonly known as a ''semiconductor fab'') can cost over US$8 billion to construct.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Intel Makes a Chip |date=June 9, 2016 |author1=Max Chafkin  |author2=Ian King |publisher=Bloomburg Businessweek |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-06-09/how-intel-makes-a-chip}}</ref>  The cost of a fabrication facility rises over time because of increased complexity of new products.

Commercial circuit packaging quickly moved to the [[dual in-line package]] (DIP), first in ceramic and later in plastic. In the 1980s pin counts of VLSI circuits exceeded the practical limit for DIP packaging, leading to [[pin grid array]] (PGA) and [[leadless chip carrier]] (LCC) packages. [[Surface-mount technology|Surface mount]] packaging appeared in the early 1980s and became popular in the late 1980s, using finer lead pitch with leads formed as either gull-wing or J-lead, as exemplified by the [[Small Outline Integrated Circuit|small-outline integrated circuit]] (SOIC) package \u2013 a carrier which occupies an area about 30\u201350% less than an equivalent DIP and is typically 70% thinner. This package has \"gull wing\" leads protruding from the two long sides and a lead spacing of 0.050&nbsp;inches.\n\nIn the late 1990s, [[PQFP|plastic quad flat pack]] (PQFP) and [[Thin Small Outline Package|thin small-outline package]] (TSOP) packages became the most common for high pin count devices, though PGA packages are still used for high-end [[microprocessor]]s.\n\n[[Ball grid array]] (BGA) packages have existed since the 1970s. [[Flip chip|Flip-chip Ball Grid Array]] packages, which allow for much higher pin count than other package types, were developed in the 1990s. In an FCBGA package the die is mounted upside-down (flipped) and connects to the package balls via a package substrate that is similar to a printed-circuit board rather than by wires. FCBGA packages allow an array of [[Input/output|input-output]] signals (called Area-I/O) to be distributed over the entire die rather than being confined to the die periphery. BGA devices have the advantage of not needing a dedicated socket, but are much harder to replace in case of device failure.\n\nIntel transitioned away from PGA to [[land grid array]] (LGA) and BGA beginning in 2004, with the last PGA socket released in 2014 for mobile platforms.  {{As of|2018}}, AMD uses PGA packages on mainstream desktop processors,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wccftech.com/amd-am4-socket-zen-bristol-bridge-soc-package-pictured/|title=AMD Zen CPU & AM4 Socket Pictured, Launching February 2017 - PGA Design With 1331 Pins Confirmed|last=Moammer|first=Khalid|date=2016-09-16|work=Wccftech|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en-US}}</ref> BGA packages on mobile processors,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/amd/ryzen_5/2500u|title=Ryzen 5 2500U  - AMD - WikiChip|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref> and high-end desktop and server microprocessors use LGA packages.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/3198924/computers/amds-tr4-threadripper-cpu-socket-is-gigantic.html|title=AMD's 'TR4' Threadripper CPU socket is gigantic|work=PCWorld|access-date=2018-05-20|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTraces{{Clarify|reason=|date=October 2018}} going out of the die, through the package, and into the [[printed circuit board]] have very different electrical properties, compared to on-chip signals.  They require special design techniques and need much more electric power than signals confined to the chip itself.\n\nWhen multiple dies are put in one package, the result is a [[system in package]], abbreviated {{Abbr|SiP|System in Package}}. A [[multi-chip module]] ({{Abbr|MCM|multi-chip module}}), is created by combining multiple dies on a small substrate often made of ceramic. The distinction between a large MCM and a small printed circuit board is sometimes fuzzy.\n\n=== Chip labeling and manufacture date ===\nMost integrated circuits are large enough to include identifying information. Four common sections are the manufacturer's name or logo, the part number, a part production batch number and [[serial number]], and a four-digit date-code to identify when the chip was manufactured. Extremely small [[surface mount technology]] parts often bear only a number used in a manufacturer's [[lookup table]] to find the chip characteristics.\n\nThe manufacturing date is commonly represented as a two-digit year followed by a two-digit week code, such that a part bearing the code 8341 was manufactured in week 41 of 1983, or approximately in October 1983.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\n{{Main|Integrated circuit layout design protection}}\n\nThe possibility of copying by photographing each layer of an integrated circuit and preparing [[photomasks]] for its production on the basis of the photographs obtained is a reason for the introduction of legislation for the protection of layout-designs.

Early digital circuits containing tens of transistors provided a few logic gates, and early linear ICs such as the [[Plessey]] SL201 or the [[Philips]] TAA320 had as few as two transistors. The number of transistors in an integrated circuit has increased dramatically since then. The term \"large scale integration\" (LSI) was first used by [[IBM]] scientist [[Rolf Landauer]] when describing the theoretical concept;{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} that term gave rise to the terms \"small-scale integration\" (SSI), \"medium-scale integration\" (MSI), \"very-large-scale integration\" (VLSI), and \"ultra-large-scale integration\" (ULSI). The early integrated circuits were SSI.\n\nSSI circuits were crucial to early [[aerospace]] projects, and aerospace projects helped inspire development of the technology. Both the [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman missile]] and [[Apollo program]] needed lightweight digital computers for their inertial guidance systems. Although the [[Apollo Guidance Computer|Apollo guidance computer]] led and motivated integrated-circuit technology,<ref>{{cite book |last=Mindell |first=David A. |title=Digital Apollo: Human and Machine in Spaceflight |year=2008 |publisher=The MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-13497-2}}</ref> it was the Minuteman missile that forced it into mass-production. The Minuteman missile program and various other [[United States Navy]] programs accounted for the total $4 million integrated circuit market in 1962, and by 1968, U.S. Government spending on [[Budget of NASA|space]] and [[Military budget of the United States|defense]] still accounted for 37% of the $312 million total production.\n\nThe demand by the U.S. Government supported the nascent integrated circuit market until costs fell enough to allow IC firms to penetrate the [[Industry|industrial]] market and eventually the [[consumer]] market. The average price per integrated circuit dropped from $50.00 in 1962 to $2.33 in 1968.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ginzberg| first = Eli| title = Economic impact of large public programs: the NASA Experience| year = 1976| publisher = Olympus Publishing Company| isbn = 0-913420-68-9| page = 57 }}</ref> Integrated circuits began to appear in [[consumer product]]s by the turn of the 1970s decade.

True LSI circuits, approaching 10,000 transistors, began to be produced around 1974, for computer main memories and second-generation microprocessors.\n\nSome SSI and MSI chips, like [[discrete transistor]]s,  are still mass-produced, both to maintain old equipment and build new devices that require only a few gates. The [[7400-series integrated circuits|7400 series]] of [[Transistor\u2013transistor logic|TTL]] chips, for example, has become a [[de facto standard]] and remains in production.\n\n=== VLSI ===\n{{Main|Very-large-scale integration}}\n[[File:80486DX2 200x.png|right|thumb|Upper interconnect layers on an [[Intel 80486]]DX2 microprocessor die]]\n\nThe final step in the development process, starting in the 1980s and continuing through the present, was \"very-large-scale integration\" ([[VLSI]]). The development started with hundreds of thousands of transistors in the early 1980s, {{As of|2016}}, transistor counts continue to grow beyond ten billion transistors per chip.\n\nMultiple developments were required to achieve this increased density. Manufacturers moved to smaller design rules and [[cleanroom|cleaner fabrication facilities]] so that they could make chips with more transistors and maintain adequate [[Manufacturing yield|yield]]. The path of process improvements was summarized by the [[International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors]] (ITRS), which has since been succeeded by the [[International Roadmap for Devices and Systems]] (IRDS). [[Electronic design automation|Electronic design tools]] improved enough to make it practical to finish these designs in a reasonable time. The more energy-efficient [[CMOS]] replaced [[NMOS logic|NMOS]] and [[PMOS logic|PMOS]], avoiding a prohibitive increase in [[Energy consumption|power consumption]]. Modern VLSI devices contain so many transistors, layers, interconnections, and other features that it is no longer feasible to check the masks or do the original design by hand.  Instead, engineers use {{Abbr|EDA|Electronic design automation}} tools to perform most [[functional verification]] work.<ref>\nC. F.

The name is taken from the term Very-Large-Scale Integration, the current state of the art when WSI was being developed.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shanefield|first1=Daniel|title=Wafer scale integration|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US4866501|website=google.com/patents|accessdate=21 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nA [[System-on-chip|system-on-a-chip]] (SoC or SOC) is an integrated circuit in which all the components needed for a computer or other system are included on a single chip.

The 3270 was the successor to the [[IBM 2260]] display terminal.  Due to the text colour on the original models, these terminals are informally known as ''[[Monochrome monitor|green screen]]'' terminals. Unlike a [[character-oriented terminal]], the 3270 minimizes the number of [[input/output|I/O]] [[interrupt]]s required by transferring large blocks of data known as [[data stream]]s, and uses a high speed proprietary communications interface, using [[coaxial cable]].\n\nAlthough IBM no longer manufactures 3270 terminals, the IBM 3270 protocol is still commonly used via [[terminal emulator|terminal emulation]] to access mainframe-based applications. Accordingly, such applications are sometimes referred to as ''green screen applications''. The use of 3270 is slowly diminishing as more and more mainframe applications acquire [[World Wide Web|Web]] interfaces, although some Web applications merely use the technique of \"[[screen scraping]]\" to capture old screens and transfer the data to modern front-ends.\n<!--  Commented out: [[File:3270ScreenShot.jpg|thumb|[[Clemson University]]'s library catalogue displayed in a 3270 emulation program running on [[Mac OS X]].]] -->\n\n== Principles ==\nThe 3270 series was designed to connect with mainframe computers, often at a remote location, using the technology then available in the early 1970s. The main goal of the system was to maximize the number of terminals that could be used on a single mainframe. To do this, the 3270 was designed to minimize the amount of data transmitted, and minimize the frequency of interrupts to the mainframe. By ensuring the CPU is not interrupted at every keystroke, a 1970s-era [[IBM 303X#IBM 3033|IBM 3033]] mainframe with only 16&nbsp;MB was able to support up to 17,500 3270 terminals under [[CICS]].\n\n[[File:IBM 3270 cluster diagram.jpg|thumb|left|Sample IBM 3270 cluster with one control unit connected to a printer and two displays]] \n3270 devices are ''clustered'', with one or more displays or printers connected to a ''control unit'' (the 3275 and 3276 included an integrated control unit).  Originally devices were connected to the control unit over coaxial cable; later [[token ring]], [[twisted pair]], or [[Ethernet]] connections were available.  A ''local'' control unit attaches directly to the [[Channel I/O|channel]] of a nearby mainframe.  A ''remote'' control unit is connected to a communications line by a [[modem]].  Remote 3270 controllers are frequently ''[[Telecommunications link#Multipoint|multi-dropped]]'', with multiple control units on a line.\n\nIn a data stream, both text and control (or formatting functions) are interspersed allowing an entire screen to be \"painted\" as a single output operation. The concept of formatting in these devices allows the screen to be divided into fields (clusters of contiguous character cells) for which numerous field attributes (colour, highlighting, character set, protection from modification) can be set. A field attribute occupies a physical location on the screen that also determines the beginning and end of a field.\n\nUsing a technique known as \"read modified\", a single transmission back to the mainframe can contain the changes from any number of formatted fields that have been modified, but without sending any unmodified fields or static data.  This technique enhances the terminal throughput of the [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and minimizes the data transmitted. Some users familiar with character interrupt-driven terminal interfaces find this technique unusual. There is also a \"read buffer\" capability that transfers the entire content of the 3270-[[screen buffer]] including field attributes. This is mainly used for debugging purposes to preserve the application program screen contents while replacing it, temporarily, with debugging information.\n\nEarly 3270s offered three types of keyboards.  The ''typewriter keyboard'' came in both a 66 key version, with no [[function key|programmed function (PF) keys]], and a 78 key version with twelve.  Both versions had two ''program attention'' (PA) keys.  The ''data entry keyboard'' had five PF keys and two PA keys. The ''operator console keyboard'' had twelve PF keys and two PA keys.<ref name=CompDesc />{{rp|p.19}}  Later 3270s had twenty-four PF keys and three PA keys. When one of these keys is pressed, it will cause its control unit to generate an I/O [[interrupt]] to the host computer and present a special code identifying which key was pressed. Application program functions such as termination, page-up, page-down, or help can be invoked by a single key press, thereby reducing the load on very busy processors.\n\nA downside to this approach was that [[vi]]-like behaviour, responding to individual keystrokes, was not possible. For the same reason, a porting of [[Lotus 1-2-3]] to mainframes with 3279 screens did not meet with success because its programmers were not able to properly adapt the spreadsheet's user interface to a \"screen at a time\" rather than \"character at a time\" device. But end-user responsiveness was arguably more predictable with 3270, something users appreciated.\n\n==Applications==\nFollowing its introduction the 3270 and compatibles were by far the most commonly used terminals on [[IBM System/370]] and successor systems.<ref name=HOB>{{cite web|last1=Brandstaetter|first1=Klaus|title=3270 -Brief History|url=http://www.hob-techtalk.com/2008/09/12/3270-a-brief-history|website=HOB Techtalk|accessdate=19 August 2015}}</ref>  IBM and third-party software that included an interactive component took for granted the presence of 3270 terminals and provided a set of [[ISPF]] [[Panel (computer software)|panels]] and supporting programs.\n\n[[Conversational Monitor System]] (CMS) in [[VM (operating system)|VM/SP]] has support for the 3270.\n\n[[Time Sharing Option]] (TSO) in [[OS/360 and successors]] has line mode command line support and also has facilities for full screen applications, e.g., [[ISPF]].\n\nDevice independent Display Operator Console Support (DIDOCS) in Multiple Console Support (MCS) for OS/360 and successors.\n\nThe SPF and [[ISPF#ISPF Editor|''Program Development Facility'']] (ISPF/PDF) [[Text editor|editors]] for [[MVS]] and [[VM (operating system)|VM/SP]] (ISPF/PDF was available for VM, but little used) and [[XEDIT]] [[Text editor|editors]] for [[VM (operating system)|VM/SP]] respectively make extensive use of 3270 features. \n\n[[CICS|Customer Information Control System]] (CICS) has support for 3270 panels.\n\nVarious versions of [[ORVYL and WYLBUR|Wylbur]] have support for 3270, including support for full-screen applications.\n \nThe modified data tag is well suited to converting formatted, structured punched card input onto the 3270 display device. With the appropriate programming, any batch program that uses formatted, structured card input can be layered onto a 3270 terminal.\n\nIBM's [[OfficeVision]] office productivity software enjoyed great success with 3270 interaction because of its design understanding. And for many years the [[PROFS]] calendar was the most commonly displayed screen on office terminals around the world.\n\nA version of the [[WordPerfect]] [[word processor]] ported to [[IBM System/370|System/370]] was designed for the 3270 architecture.\n\n3270 and The Web (and [[HyperText Transfer Protocol|HTTP]]) are similar in that both follow a [[thin client]] [[client-server]] architecture whereby they, the clients, are given primary responsibility for managing presentation and user input. This minimizes host interactions while still facilitating server-based information retrieval and processing.\n\nWith the arrival of the web, application development has in many ways returned to the 3270 approach. In the 3270 era, all application functionality was provided centrally. With the advent of the [[personal computer|PC]], the idea was to invoke central systems only when absolutely unavoidable, and to do all application processing with local software on the personal computer. Now in the web era (and with wikis in particular), the application again is strongly centrally controlled, with only technical functionality distributed to the PC.\n\nIn the early 1990s a popular solution to link PCs with the mainframes was the [[Irma board]], an [[expansion card]] that plugged into a PC and connected to the controller through a coaxial cable.  IRMA also allows file transfers between the PC and the mainframe.\n\n== Third parties ==\n\nOne of the first groups to write and provide operating system support for the 3270 and its early predecessors was the University of Michigan, who created the [[Michigan Terminal System]] in order for the hardware to be useful outside of the manufacturer.{{what|date=August 2017}}  MTS was the default OS at Michigan for many years, and was still used at Michigan well into the 1990s.\nMany manufacturers, such as [[GTE]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[Honeywell]]/Incoterm Div, [[Memorex]], [[ITT Corporation|ITT Courier]] and [[Teletype Corporation|Teletype]]/[[AT&T]] created 3270 compatible<ref>Some, such as the GTE IS/7800, were not fully compatible.</ref> terminals, or adapted ASCII terminals such as the [[HP 2640]] series to have a similar block-mode capability that would transmit a screen at a time, with some form validation capability. Modern applications are sometimes built upon legacy 3270 applications, using software utilities to capture ([[Data scraping#Screen scraping|screen scraping]]) screens and transfer the data to web pages or GUI interfaces.\n\n== Models ==\n\nThe IBM 3270 display terminal subsystem consists of displays, printers and controllers.\nOptional features for the 3275 and 3277 are the ''selector-pen'' or [[light pen]], ASCII rather than [[EBCDIC]] character set, an audible alarm, and a keylock for the keyboard.  A ''keyboard numeric lock'' was available and will lock the keyboard if the operator attempts to enter non-numeric data into a field defined as numeric.<ref name=CompDesc>{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM 3270 Information Display System Component Description|year=1972|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/3270/GA27-2749-1_IBM_3270_Information_Display_System_Component_Description_Jun72.pdf}}</ref> Later an ''Operator Identification Card Reader'' was added which could read information encoded on a [[magnetic stripe card]].\n\n===Displays===\n*3277 model 1: 40\u00d712 terminal\n*3277 model 2: 80\u00d724 terminal, the biggest success of all\n*3277 GA: a 3277 with an RS232C I/O, often used to drive a [[Tektronix]] 4013 or 4015 graphic screen (monochrome)\n*3278 models 1\u20135: next-generation, with accented characters and dead keys in countries that needed them\n** model 1: 80x12\n** model 2: 80\u00d724\n** model 3: 80\u00d732 or 80x24 (switchable)\n** model 4: 80\u00d743 or 80x24 (switchable)\n** model 5: 132\u00d727 or 80\u00d724 (switchable)\n*3278 PS: programmable characters; able to display monochrome graphics\n*[[IBM 3279|3279]]: colour terminal, 4-colour (text) or 7-colour (graphics) version\n*3290: a large, amber monochrome [[plasma display]] unit, capable of displaying in various modes, including four independent 3278 model 2 terminals, or a single 160\u00d762 terminal; it also supported partitioning.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.cics.ts31.doc/dfhp3/dfhp32r.htm | title =BMS Partition Support | publisher =IBM | accessdate = 21 May 2009}}</ref>\n*3178: lower cost terminal (1983)\n*3179: low cost colour terminal (1984)\n*3104: low-cost R-loop connected terminal for the [[IBM 8100]] system\n*3472 Infowindow\n\n(Generally, 3277 models allow only upper-case input, except for the mixed EBCDIC/APL or ''text'' keyboards, which have lower case.

The printers were developed by the [[Endicott, New York]], laboratory.  As the subsystem expanded, the 3276 display-controller was developed by the [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]], Japan, laboratory, and later the [[IBM Yamato Facility|Yamato laboratory]]; and the 3279 colour display and 3287 colour printer by the [[IBM Hursley|Hursley]], UK, laboratory.  The subsystem products were manufactured in Kingston (displays and controllers), Endicott (printers), and [[Greenock]], Scotland, UK, (most products) and shipped to users in U.S. and worldwide. 3278 terminals continued to be manufactured in [[Hortol\u00e2ndia]], near [[Campinas]], Brazil as far as late 1980s, having its internals redesigned by a local engineering team using modern CMOS technology, while retaining its external look and feel.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\n== Telnet 3270 ==\n\nTelnet 3270, or '''tn3270''' describes both the process of sending and receiving 3270 data streams using the [[Telnet]] protocol and the software that emulates a 3270 class terminal that communicates using that process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1647|title=TN3270 Enhancements|last=Kelly|first=B.|date=July 1994|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|rfc=1647|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2355|title=TN3270 Enhancements|last=Kelly|first=Bill|date=June 1998|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|rfc=2355|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6270|title=The 'tn3270' URI Scheme|last=Yevstifeyev|first=Mykyta|date=June 2011|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|rfc=6270|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>  tn3270 allows a 3270 [[terminal emulator]] to communicate over a [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] network instead of an [[System network architecture|SNA]] network.

Commands instruct the 3270 control unit to perform some action on a specified device, such a read or write.  Orders are sent as part of the data stream to control the format of the device buffer.\n\nThe following description applies to the 3271, 3272, and 3275 control units.  Later models of 3270 have additional capabilities.\n\n===Commands===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Command !! hexadecimal<br>Code (local) !!

The WCC controls the operation of the device.  Bits may start printer operation and specify a print format.  Other bit settings will sound the audible alarm if installed, unlock the keyboard to allow operator entry, or reset all the Modified Data Tags in the device buffer.\n\n===Orders===\nOrders consist of the order code byte followed by zero to three bytes of variable information.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Orders for 3277{{efn|\nLater models added\n*Start Field Extended (SFE)\n*Modify Field (MF)\n*Set Attribute (SA)\n*Graphic Escape (GE)\n}}\n|-\n! rowspan=2| Order \n! colspan=4| Hexadecimal code (EBCDIC)\n! rowspan=2| Description<ref name=CompDesc />\n|-\n!Byte&nbsp;1 !!

One indicates that only numeric input is accepted, and automatically shifts to numeric for some keyboards.\n* Bit 4 and 5 operate in tandem: \n** '00'B indicate that the field is displayed on the screen and is not ''selector-pen detectable''.\n** '01'B indicates that the field is displayable and selector-pen detectable.\n** '10'B indicates that the field is ''intensified'' (bright), displayable, and selector-pen detectable.\n** '11'B indicates that the field is non-display, non-printable, and not pen detectable. This last can be used in conjunction with the modified data tag to imbed static data on the screen that will be read each time data was read from the device.\n* Bit 7 is the \"Modified Data Tag\", where '0' indicates that the associated field has not been modified by the operator and '1' indicates that it has been modified. As noted above, this bit can be set programmatically to cause the field to be treated as modified.\n\nLater models include ''base colour'' support for four colours. \"In base color mode, the protection and intensity bits are used in combination to select among four colors: normally white, red, blue, and green; the protection bits retain their protection functions as well as determining color.\"<ref name=Attributes>{{cite web|last=IBM Corporation|title=3270 field attributes|url=http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/cicsts/v3r1/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.ibm.cics.ts31.doc%2Fdfhp3%2Fdfhp3at.htm|accessdate=7 July 2012}}</ref> Still later models used ''extended attributes'' to add support for seven colours, blinking, reverse video, underscoring, field outlining, field validation, and programmed symbols.<ref name=Attributes /> In addition, later models added character attributes, which could establish, e.g., color for individual characters without starting a new field or taking up a screen position.\n\n===Buffer addressing===\n3270 displays and printers have a buffer containing one byte for every screen position.  For example, a 3277 model 2 featured a screen size of 24 rows of 80 columns for a buffer size of 1920 bytes.  Bytes are addressed from zero to the screen size minus one, in this example 1919.  \"There is a fixed relationship between each ... buffer storage location and its position on the display screen.\"<ref name=CompDesc />{{rp|p.13}}  Most orders start operation at the \"current\" buffer address, and executing an order or writing data will update this address.  The buffer address can be set directly using the ''Set Buffer Address (SBA)'' order, often followed by ''Start Field''.  For a device with a 1920 character display a twelve bit address is sufficient.  Later 3270s with larger screen sizes use fourteen or sixteen bits.\n\nAddresses are encoded in orders in two bytes.  For twelve bit addresses the high order two bits of each byte are normally set to form valid EBCDIC (or ASCII) characters.  For example, address 0 is coded as X'4040', or space-space, address 1919 is coded as X'5D7F', or '{{not a typo|)\"}}'.<ref name=CompDesc />{{rp|pp.75\u201390}}  Programmers hand coding panels usually keep the table of addresses from the 3270 Component Description or the 3270 Reference Card handy. For fourteen and sixteen bit address, the address uses contiguous bits in two bytes.\n\n===Example===\nThe following data stream writes an attribute in row 24, column 1, writes the (protected) characters '> ' in row 24, columns 2 and 3, and creates an unprotected field on row 24 from columns 5-79.  Because the buffer wraps around an attribute is placed on row 24, column 80 to terminate the input field.  This data stream would normally be written using an Erase/Write command which would set undefined positions on the screen to '00'x.  Values are given in hexadecimal.\n<pre>\n  Data              Description\n  D3                WCC [reset device + restore (unlock) keyboard + reset MDT]\n  11 5C F0          SBA Row 24 Column 1\n  1D F0             SF/Attribute\n                    [protected, alphanumeric, display normal intensity, not pen-detectable, MDT off]\n  6E 40             '> '\n  1D 40             SF/Attribute\n                    [unprotected, alphanumeric, display normal intensity, not pen-detectable, MDT off]\n                    SBA is not required here since this is being written at the current buffer position \n  13                IC - cursor displays at current position: Row 24, column 5\n  11 5D 7F          SBA Row 24 Column 80\n  1D F0             SF/Attribute\n                    [protected, alphanumeric, display normal intensity, not pen-detectable, MDT off]\n</pre>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[3270 emulator]]\n* [[List of IBM products]]\n* [[IBM 5250]] display terminal subsystem for IBM [[AS/400]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n== References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/dpd50/dpd50_chronology4.html Partial IBM history]  noting the unveiling of the 3270 display system in 1971\n* [http://www.elink.ibmlink.ibm.com/publications/servlet/pbi.wss?CTY=US&FNC=SRX&PBL=GA23-0059-07 3270 Information Display System - 3270 Data Stream Programmer's Reference] from IBM\n* [http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/sw_upgrades/interlink/r2_0/custom/cgtelnet.html?dtid=osscdc000283 Introduction to Telnet 3270] from Cisco\n* RFC 1041 - Telnet 3270 regime option\n* RFC 1576 - TN3270 Current Practices\n* RFC 2355 - TN3270 Enhancements\n* [http://www.tommysprinkle.com/mvs/P3270/ 3270 Data Stream Programming]\n* [https://github.com/rbanffy/3270font rbanffy/3270font]: A TTF remake of the font from the 3270\n\n----\n{{FOLDOC}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ibm 3270}}\n[[Category:IBM computer terminals|3270]]\n[[Category:IBM display devices|3270]]\n[[Category:Block-oriented terminal]]\n[[Category:Systems Network Architecture]]\n[[Category:Multimodal interaction]]\n[[Category:History of human\u2013computer interaction]]", "sha1": "68jljf2nmsi8lvezytt82h2wixb80xb"}}, {"title": "I.

Pei''', is a [[Chinese American]] architect.  Born in [[Guangzhou|Kwangchou]] and raised in [[Hong Kong]] and [[Shanghai]], Pei drew inspiration at an early age from the gardens at [[Suzhou|Soochow]]. In 1935, he moved to the United States and enrolled in the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s architecture school, but quickly transferred to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He was unhappy with the focus at both schools on [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and spent his free time researching emerging architects, especially [[Le Corbusier]]. After graduating, he joined the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] (GSD) and became a friend of the [[Bauhaus]] architects [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]]. In 1948, Pei was recruited by [[New York City]] real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]], for whom he worked for seven years before establishing his own independent design firm I. M. Pei & Associates in 1955, which became I. M. Pei & Partners in 1966 and later in 1989 became [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]]. Pei retired from full-time practice in 1990. Since then, he has taken on work as an architectural consultant primarily from his sons' architectural firm [[Pei Partnership Architects]].\n\nPei's first major recognition came with the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] in Colorado (designed in 1961, and completed in 1967). His new stature led to his selection as chief architect for the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] in Massachusetts. He went on to design [[Dallas City Hall]] and the East Building of the [[National Gallery of Art]]. He returned to China for the first time in 1975 to design a hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]], and designed [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong]], a skyscraper in Hong Kong for the [[Bank of China]] fifteen years later. In the early 1980s, Pei was the focus of controversy when he designed [[Louvre Pyramid|a glass-and-steel pyramid]] for the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] in Paris. He later returned to the world of the arts by designing the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in Dallas, the [[Miho Museum]] in Japan, the [[Suzhou Museum]] in Suzhou, [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] in [[Qatar]], and the [[Grand Duke Jean Museum of Modern Art]], abbreviated to Mudam, in [[Luxembourg]].\n\nPei has won a wide variety of prizes and awards in the field of architecture, including the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1979, the first [[Praemium Imperiale]] for Architecture in 1989, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]] in 2003. In 1983, he won the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes called the [[Nobel Prize]] of architecture.\n\n== Childhood ==\n[[File:Shizlinhehuaci.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Men and women stand on curving rock formations overlooking a pond containing flowery plants.|As a child, Pei found the [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]] in [[Suzhou]] to be \"an ideal playground\".<ref name=\"vb18\">Boehm, p. 18.</ref>]]\n\nPei's ancestry traces back to the [[Ming Dynasty]], when his family moved from [[Anhui]] province to Suzhou, but most importantly his family were directors of the Bank of China which later on funded the construction of important projects including the Kips Bay project in New York. They also found wealth in the sale of medicinal herbs, the family stressed the importance of helping the less fortunate.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 29\u201330; Boehm, p. 17.</ref> Ieoh Ming Pei was born on 26 April 1917 to Tsuyee Pei and Lien Kwun, and the family moved to Hong Kong one year later. The family eventually included five children. As a boy, Pei was very close to his mother, a devout Buddhist who was recognized for her skills as a [[flautist]]. She invited him, his brothers, and his sisters to join her on meditation retreats.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 31\u201332; Boehm, p. 25.</ref> His relationship with his father was less intimate. Their interactions were respectful but distant.<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 31\">Wiseman, p. 31.</ref>\n\nPei's ancestors' success meant that the family lived in the upper echelons of society, but Pei said his father was \"not cultivated in the ways of the arts\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 31.</ref> The younger Pei, drawn more to music and other cultural forms than to his father's domain of banking, explored art on his own. \"I have cultivated myself,\" he said later.<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 31\" />\n\nAt the age of ten, Pei moved with his family to Shanghai after his father was promoted. Pei attended Saint Johns Middle School, run by [[Protestantism|Protestant]] missionaries. Academic discipline was rigorous; students were allowed only one half-day each month for leisure. Pei enjoyed playing [[Cue sports|billiards]] and watching Hollywood movies, especially those of [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Charlie Chaplin]]. He also learned rudimentary English skills by reading the [[Bible]] and novels by [[Charles Dickens]].<ref name=\"w3133\">Wiseman, pp. 31\u201333.</ref>\n\n[[File:Shanghai Bund 2006.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Pedestrians walk before a row of trees and a series of tall buildings. A blue sky overhead is obscured slightly by several clouds.|Pei describes the architecture of Shanghai's [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]] waterfront area (seen here in a 2006 photo) as \"very much a colonial past\".<ref>Boehm, p. 22.</ref>]]\n\nShanghai's many international elements gave it the name \"Paris of the East\".<ref>Boehm, p. 21.</ref> The city's global architectural flavors had a profound influence on Pei, from the [[The Bund (Shanghai)|Bund]] waterfront area to the [[Park Hotel Shanghai|Park Hotel]], built in 1934. He was also impressed by the many gardens of Suzhou, where he spent the summers with extended family and regularly visited a nearby ancestral shrine. The [[Lion Grove Garden|Shizilin Garden]], built in the 14th century by a Buddhist monk, was especially influential. Its unusual rock formations, stone bridges, and waterfalls remained etched in Pei's memory for decades. He spoke later of his fondness for the garden's blending of natural and human-built structures.<ref name=\"vb18\" /><ref name=\"w3133\" />\n\nSoon after the move to Shanghai, Pei's mother developed cancer. As a pain reliever, she was prescribed [[opium]], and assigned the task of preparing her pipe to Pei. She died shortly after his thirteenth birthday, and he was profoundly upset.<ref>Boehm, p. 25.</ref> The children were sent to live with extended family; their father became more consumed by his work and more physically distant. Pei said: \"My father began living his own separate life pretty soon after that.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 26.</ref>  His father later married a woman named Aileen, who moved to New York later in her life.<ref>Gonzalez, David. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E5D91339F93BA15752C1A96E958260 About New York; A Chinese Oasis for the Soul on Staten Island]\". ''[[The New York Times]]''. 28 November 1998. Accessed on 17 January 2011.</ref>\n\n== Education and formative years ==\n[[File:Bing Crosby cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|right|alt=A man wearing a grey sweater and a fedora squats near an open box, holding a small canvas bag.|Pei said \"[[Bing Crosby]]'s films in particular had a tremendous influence on my choosing the United States instead of England to pursue my education.\"<ref>Boehm, pp. 33\u201334.</ref>]]\n\nAs Pei, neared the end of his secondary education, he decided to study at a university. He was accepted to a number of schools, but decided to enroll at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> Pei's choice had two roots. While studying in Shanghai, he had closely examined the catalogs for various institutions of higher learning around the world. The architectural program at the University of Pennsylvania stood out to him.<ref>Wiseman, p. 34.</ref> The other major factor was Hollywood. Pei was fascinated by the representations of college life in the films of [[Bing Crosby]], which differed tremendously from the academic atmosphere in China. \"College life in the U.S. seemed to me to be mostly fun and games\", he said in 2000. \"Since I was too young to be serious, I wanted to be part of it&nbsp;... You could get a feeling for it in Bing Crosby's movies. College life in America seemed very exciting to me. It's not real, we know that. Nevertheless, at that time it was very attractive to me. I decided that was the country for me.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 34.</ref>\n\nIn 1935 Pei boarded a boat and sailed to San Francisco, then traveled by train to Philadelphia. What he found, however, differed vastly from his expectations. Professors at the University of Pennsylvania based their teaching in the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts style]], rooted in the classical traditions of Greece and Rome. Pei was more intrigued by [[modern architecture]], and also felt intimidated by the high level of [[Architectural drawing|drafting]] proficiency shown by other students. He decided to abandon architecture and transferred to the engineering program at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Once he arrived, however, the dean of the architecture school commented on his eye for design and convinced Pei to return to his original major.<ref>Wiseman, p. 35.</ref>\n\nMIT's architecture faculty was also focused on the Beaux-Arts school, and Pei found himself uninspired by the work. In the library he found three books by the Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]]. Pei was inspired by the innovative designs of the new [[International Style (architecture)|International style]], characterized by simplified form and the use of glass and steel materials. Le Corbusier visited MIT in {{Nowrap|November 1935}}, an occasion which powerfully affected Pei: \"The two days with Le Corbusier, or 'Corbu' as we used to call him, were probably the most important days in my architectural education.\"<ref name=\"vb36\">Boehm, p. 36.</ref> Pei was also influenced by the work of US architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. In 1938 he drove to [[Spring Green, Wisconsin]], to visit Wright's famous [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] building. After waiting for two hours, however, he left without meeting Wright.<ref name=\"wright\">Boehm, p. 36; Wiseman, p. 36.</ref>\n\n[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A portrait photograph of a middle-aged man with bushy white hair, wearing a dark suit|Pei attempted to meet renowned architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], but gave up after waiting for two hours.<ref name=\"wright\" />]]\n\nAlthough he disliked the Beaux-Arts emphasis at MIT, Pei excelled in his studies. \"I certainly don't regret the time at MIT\", he said later. \"There I learned the science and technique of building, which is just as essential to architecture.\"<ref name=\"vb40\">Boehm, p. 40.</ref> Pei received his [[Bachelor of Architecture|B.Arch.]] degree in 1940.<ref>Boehm, pp. 40\u201341. Pei used the term \"propaganda\", which he believed to be value-neutral; his advisers disapproved.</ref>\n\nWhile visiting New York City in the late '30s, Pei met a [[Wellesley College]] student named Eileen Loo. They began dating and they married in the spring of 1942. She enrolled in the [[landscape architecture]] program at [[Harvard University]], and Pei was thus introduced to members of the faculty at Harvard's [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|Graduate School of Design]] (GSD). He was excited by the lively atmosphere, and joined the GSD in {{Nowrap|December 1942}}.<ref>Wiseman, p. 39; Boehm, pp. 36\u201337.</ref>\n\nLess than a month later, Pei suspended his work at Harvard to join the [[National Defense Research Committee]], which coordinated scientific research into US weapons technology during [[World War&nbsp;II]]. Pei's background in architecture was seen as a considerable asset; one member of the committee told him: \"If you know how to build you should also know how to destroy.\"<ref>Quoted in von Boehm, p. 42; a slightly different wording appears in Wiseman, p. 39: \"If you know how to build a building, you know how to destroy it.\"</ref> The fight against Germany was ending, so he focused on the [[Pacific War]]. The US realized that its bombs used against the stone buildings of Europe would be ineffective against Japanese cities, mostly constructed from wood and paper; Pei was assigned to work on [[incendiary device|incendiary bombs]]. Pei spent two and a half years with the NDRC, but has revealed few details.<ref>Boehm, p. 42.</ref>\n\nIn 1945 Eileen gave birth to a son, T'ing Chung; she withdrew from the landscape architecture program in order to care for him. Pei returned to Harvard in the autumn of 1945, and received a position as assistant professor of design. The GSD was developing into a hub of resistance to the Beaux-Arts orthodoxy. At the center were members of the [[Bauhaus]], a European architectural movement that had advanced the cause of modernist design. The Nazi regime had condemned the Bauhaus school, and its leaders left Germany. Two of these, [[Walter Gropius]] and [[Marcel Breuer]], took positions at the Harvard GSD. Their iconoclastic focus on modern architecture appealed to Pei, and he worked closely with both men.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 41\u201343; Boehm, pp. 37\u201340.</ref>\n\nOne of Pei's design projects at the GSD was a plan for an art museum in Shanghai. He wanted to create a mood of Chinese authenticity in the architecture without using traditional materials or styles.<ref name=\"qw44\">Quoted in Wiseman, p., 44.</ref> The design was based on straight modernist structures, organized around a central courtyard garden, with other similar natural settings arranged nearby. It was very well received; Gropius, in fact, called it \"the best thing done in [my] master class\".<ref name=\"qw44\" /> Pei received his [[Master of Architecture|M.Arch.]] degree in 1946, and taught at Harvard for another two years.<ref name=\"Pei Cobb Freed & Partner\" /><ref>Wiseman, p. 45.</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1948\u201356: Early career with Webb and Knapp ===\n\nIn the spring of 1948 Pei was recruited by New York real estate magnate [[William Zeckendorf]] to join a staff of architects for his firm of [[Webb and Knapp]] to design buildings around the country. Pei found Zeckendorf's personality the opposite of his own; his new boss was known for his loud speech and gruff demeanor. Nevertheless, they became good friends and Pei found the experience personally enriching. Zeckendorf was well connected politically, and Pei enjoyed learning about the social world of New York's city planners.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 48\u201349.</ref>\n\nHis first project for Webb and Knapp was an apartment building with funding from the [[Housing Act of 1949]]. Pei's design was based on a circular tower with concentric rings. The areas closest to the supporting pillar handled utilities and circulation; the apartments themselves were located toward the outer edge. Zeckendorf loved the design and even showed it off to Le Corbusier when they met. The cost of such an unusual design was too high, however, and the building never moved beyond the model stage.<ref>Wiseman, p. 51.</ref>\n\n[[File:131 Ponce de Leon Ave., Atlanta - I.M. Pei building.JPG|thumb|left|Pei's first project (1949)<br /> [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue]], Atlanta]]\n\nPei finally saw his architecture come to life in 1949,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcf-p.com/a/f/fme/imp/p/p.html|title=I. M. Pei|website=www.pcf-p.com}}</ref> when he designed a two-story [[131 Ponce de Leon Avenue|corporate building for Gulf Oil]] in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained as part of an apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior [[curtain wall (architecture)|curtain wall]] brought praise from the journal ''Architectural Forum''.<ref>Wiseman, p. 52.</ref> Pei's designs echoed the work of [[Mies van der Rohe]] in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including [[Henry N. Cobb]] and [[Ulrich Franzen]]. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the [[Roosevelt Field (Shopping Mall)|Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall]]. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with [[teak]] walls and a glass [[clerestory]]. They also installed a control panel into the desk that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 53\u201354.</ref>\n\n[[File:L'Enfant Plaza - IMG 1926.JPG|thumb|right|Pei wanted the open spaces and buildings of [[L'Enfant Plaza]] to be \"functionally and visually related\" to one another.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 61.</ref>]]\n\nIn 1952 Pei and his team began work on a series of projects in Denver, Colorado. The first of these was the Mile High Center, which compressed the core building into less than twenty-five percent of the total site; the rest is adorned with an exhibition hall and fountain-dotted plazas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 57\u201358.</ref> One block away, Pei's team also redesigned Denver's Courthouse Square, which combined office spaces, commercial venues, and hotels. These projects helped Pei conceptualize architecture as part of the larger urban geography. \"I learned the process of development,\" he said later, \"and about the city as a living organism.\"<ref name=\"vb52\">Boehm, p. 52.</ref> These lessons, he said, became essential for later projects.<ref name=\"vb52\" />\n\nPei and his team also designed a united urban area for Washington, D.C., [[L'Enfant Plaza]] (named for French-American architect [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\">Williams, 2005, p. 120; Moeller and Weeks, 2006, p. 59.</ref> Pei's associate [[Araldo Cossutta]] was the lead architect for the plaza's North Building (955 L'Enfant Plaza SW) and South Building (490 L'Enfant Plaza SW).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\" /> [[Vlastimil Koubek]] was the architect for the East Building ([[L'Enfant Plaza Hotel]], located at 480 L'Enfant Plaza SW), and for the Center Building (475 L'Enfant Plaza SW; now the [[United States Postal Service]] headquarters).<ref name=\"PeiLenfant\" /> The team set out with a broad vision that was praised by both ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Washington Star]]'' (which rarely agreed on anything), but funding problems forced revisions and a significant reduction in scale.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 60\u201362.</ref>\n\nIn 1955 Pei's group took a step toward institutional independence from Webb and Knapp by establishing a new firm called I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Associates. (The name changed later to I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners.) They gained the freedom to work with other companies, but continued working primarily with Zeckendorf. The new firm distinguished itself through the use of detailed [[architectural model]]s. They took on the [[Kips Bay]] residential area on the east side of Manhattan, where Pei set up [[Kips Bay Towers]], two large long towers of apartments with recessed windows (to provide shade and privacy) in a neat grid, adorned with rows of trees. Pei involved himself in the construction process at Kips Bay, even inspecting the bags of concrete to check for consistency of color.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 62\u201364.</ref>\n\nThe company continued its urban focus with the [[Society Hill]] project in central [[Philadelphia]]. Pei designed the [[Society Hill Towers]], a three-building residential block injecting cubist design into the 18th-century milieu of the neighborhood. As with previous projects, abundant green spaces were central to Pei's vision, which also added traditional [[townhouse]]s to aid the transition from classical to modern design.<ref>Boehm, p. 51.</ref>\n\nFrom 1958 to 1963 Pei and [[Ray Affleck]] developed a key downtown block of Montreal in a phased process that involved one of Pei's most admired structures in the Commonwealth, the cruciform tower known as the Royal Bank Plaza ([[Place Ville Marie]]). According to the [[Canadian Encyclopedia]] \"its grand plaza and lower office buildings, designed by internationally famous US architect I. M. Pei, helped to set new standards for architecture in Canada in the 1960s ... The tower's smooth aluminum and glass surface and crisp unadorned geometric form demonstrate Pei's adherence to the mainstream of 20th-century modern design.\"<ref>The Canadian Encyclopedia online version</ref>\n\nAlthough these projects were satisfying, Pei wanted to establish an independent name for himself. In 1959 he was approached by MIT to design a building for its [[Earth science]] program. The [[Green Building (MIT)|Green Building]] continued the grid design of Kips Bay and Society Hill. The pedestrian walkway at the ground floor, however, was prone to sudden gusts of wind, which embarrassed Pei. \"Here I was from MIT,\" he said, \"and I didn't know about [[wind-tunnel]] effects.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 67.</ref> At the same time, he designed the [[Luce Memorial Chapel]] in at [[Tunghai University]] in [[Taichung]], [[Taiwan]]. The soaring structure, commissioned by the same organisation that had run his middle school in Shanghai, broke severely from the cubist grid patterns of his urban projects.<ref>Wiseman, p. 67.</ref><ref>Wiseman, pp. 66\u201368.</ref>\n\nThe challenge of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising the plans for them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. \"Design is something you have to put your hand to,\" he said. \"While my people had the luxury of doing one job at a time, I had to keep track of the whole enterprise.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 69.</ref> Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.&nbsp;M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 69\u201371.</ref>\n\n[[File:National Center for Atmospheric Research - Boulder, Colorado.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A series of brown boxlike buildings stand in front of a mountain.|Pei said he wanted the [[Mesa Laboratory]] of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] to look \"as if it were carved out of the mountain\".<ref name=\"vb60\">Boehm, p. 60.</ref>]]\n\n=== NCAR and Related Projects ===\nPei was able to return to hands-on design when he was approached in 1961 by [[Walter Orr Roberts]] to design the new [[Mesa Laboratory]] for the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] outside [[Boulder, Colorado]]. The project differed from Pei's earlier urban work; it would rest in an open area in the foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. He drove with his wife around the region, visiting assorted buildings and surveying the natural environs. He was impressed by the [[United States Air Force Academy]] in Colorado Springs, but felt it was \"detached from nature\".<ref>Boehm, p. 59.</ref>\n\nThe conceptualization stages were important for Pei, presenting a need and an opportunity to break from the Bauhaus tradition. He later recalled the long periods of time he spent in the area: \"I recalled the places I had seen with my mother when I was a little boy\u2014the mountaintop Buddhist retreats. There in the Colorado mountains, I tried to listen to the silence again\u2014just as my mother had taught me. The investigation of the place became a kind of religious experience for me.\"<ref name=\"vb60\" />\nPei also drew inspiration from the [[Mesa Verde National Park|Mesa Verde]] cliff dwellings of the [[Ancient Pueblo Peoples]]; he wanted the buildings to exist in harmony with their natural surroundings.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> To this end, he called for a rock-treatment process that could color the buildings to match the nearby mountains. He also set the complex back on the mesa overlooking the city, and designed the approaching road to be long, winding, and indirect.<ref>Wiseman, p. 80.</ref>\n\nRoberts disliked Pei's initial designs, referring to them as \"just a bunch of towers\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 79.</ref> Roberts intended his comments as typical of scientific experimentation, rather than artistic critique; still, Pei was frustrated. His second attempt, however, fit Roberts' vision perfectly: a spaced-out series of clustered buildings, joined by lower structures and complemented by two underground levels. The complex uses many elements of cubist design, and the walkways are arranged to increase the probability of casual encounters among colleagues.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 73, 86, and 90; Boehm, p. 61.</ref>\n\n[[File:Palm court 1995.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grid of palm trees arranged in a tiled courtyard stands to the right of a dormitory building.|As with NCAR, Pei combined elements of cubism and natural harmony when designing the dormitories at [[New College of Florida]] in the mid-1960s.<ref>Wiseman, p. 94.</ref>]]\n\nOnce the laboratory was built, several problems with its construction became apparent. Leaks in the roof caused difficulties for researchers, and the shifting of clay soil beneath caused cracks in the buildings which were expensive to repair. Still, both architect and project manager were pleased with the final result. Pei refers to the NCAR complex as his \"breakout building\", and he remained a friend of Roberts until the scientist died in {{Nowrap|March 1990}}.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 91 and 74.</ref>\n\nThe success of NCAR brought renewed attention to Pei's design acumen. He was recruited to work on a variety of projects, including the [[S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications]] at [[Syracuse University]], the [[Sundrome]] terminal at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] in New York City, and dormitories at [[New College of Florida]].<ref>[http://www.ncf.edu/about-us/history History]. 2009. New College of Florida. Retrieved on 12 November 2009.</ref>\n\n=== Kennedy Library ===\n\nAfter President [[John F. Kennedy]] was [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassinated]] in {{Nowrap|November 1963}}, his family and friends discussed how to construct a library that would serve as a fitting memorial. A committee was formed to advise Kennedy's widow [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline]], who would make the final decision. The group deliberated for months and considered many famous architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 96\u201398.</ref> Eventually, Kennedy chose Pei to design the library, based on two considerations. First, she appreciated the variety of ideas he had used for earlier projects. \"He didn't seem to have just one way to solve a problem,\" she said. \"He seemed to approach each commission thinking only of it and then develop a way to make something beautiful.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 98.</ref> Ultimately, however, Kennedy made her choice based on her personal connection with Pei. Calling it \"really an emotional decision\", she explained: \"He was so full of promise, like Jack; they were born in the same year. I decided it would be fun to take a great leap with him.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 99.</ref>\n\nThe project was plagued with problems from the outset. The first was scope. President Kennedy had begun considering the structure of his library soon after taking office, and he wanted to include archives from his administration, a museum of personal items, and a political science institute. After the assassination, the list expanded to include a fitting memorial tribute to the slain president. The variety of necessary inclusions complicated the design process and caused significant delays.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 95 and 100.</ref>\n\n[[File:JFK library Stitch Crop.jpg|thumb|250px|left|alt=A white triangular tower rises beside a black glass building, with circular structures on either side.|Pei considers the [[John F. Kennedy Library]] \"the most important commission\" in his life.<ref name=\"vb56\">Boehm, p. 56.</ref>]]\n\nPei's first proposed design included a large glass pyramid that would fill the interior with sunlight, meant to represent the optimism and hope that Kennedy's administration had symbolized for so many in the US. Mrs. Kennedy liked the design, but resistance began in Cambridge, the first proposed site for the building, as soon as the project was announced. Many community members worried that the library would become a tourist attraction, causing particular problems with traffic congestion. Others worried that the design would clash with the architectural feel of nearby [[Harvard Square]]. By the mid-70s, Pei tried proposing a new design, but the library's opponents resisted every effort.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 102\u2013113.</ref> These events pained Pei, who had sent all three of his sons to Harvard, and although he rarely discussed his frustration, it was evident to his wife. \"I could tell how tired he was by the way he opened the door at the end of the day,\" she said. \"His footsteps were dragging. It was very hard for I.&nbsp;M. to see that so many people didn't want the building.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 113.</ref>\n\nFinally the project moved to [[Columbia Point (Boston)|Columbia Point]], near the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]. The new site was less than ideal; it was located on an old landfill, and just over a large sewage pipe. Pei's architectural team added more fill to cover the pipe and developed an elaborate ventilation system to conquer the odor. A new design was unveiled, combining a large square glass-enclosed atrium with a triangular tower and a circular walkway.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 115\u2013116.</ref>\n\nThe [[John F. Kennedy Library|John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum]] was dedicated on 20 October 1979. Critics generally liked the finished building, but the architect himself was unsatisfied. The years of conflict and compromise had changed the nature of the design, and Pei felt that the final result lacked its original passion. \"I wanted to give something very special to the memory of President Kennedy,\" he said in 2000. \"It could and should have been a great project.\"<ref name=\"vb56\" /> Pei's work on the Kennedy project boosted his reputation as an architect of note.<ref>Wiseman, p. 119.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|\"Pei Plan\" in Oklahoma City}}\n\n=== \"Pei Plan\" in Oklahoma City ===\n\n{{Main|Pei Plan (Oklahoma City)}}\n\nThe Pei Plan was an urban redevelopment initiative designed for downtown [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], in the 1960s and 1970s. It is the informal name for two related commissions  by Pei \u2013 namely the Central Business District General Neighborhood Renewal Plan (design completed 1964) and the Central Business District Project I-A Development Plan (design completed 1966). It was formally adopted in 1965, and implemented in various public and private phases throughout the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe plan called for the demolition of hundreds of old downtown structures in favor of renewed parking, office building, and retail developments, in addition to public projects such as the Myriad Convention Center and the Myriad Botanical Gardens. It was the dominant template for downtown development in Oklahoma City from its inception through the 1970s. The plan generated mixed results and opinion, largely succeeding in re-developing office building and parking infrastructure but failing to attract its anticipated retail and residential development. Significant public resentment also developed as a result of the destruction of multiple historic structures. As a result, Oklahoma City's leadership avoided large-scale urban planning for downtown throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, until the passage of the [[Metropolitan Area Projects Plan|Metropolitan Area Projects]] (MAPS) initiative in 1993.<ref>[http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ \"Pei Plan and Pei Model History\".] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109035740/http://www.impeiokc.com/history/pei-model-history/ |date=9 November 2010 }} IM Pei Oklahoma City.

In 1964 the acting mayor, [[J. Erik Jonsson|Erik Jonsson]], began working to change the community's image. Dallas was known and disliked as the city where the president had been killed, but Jonsson began a program designed to initiate a community renewal. One of the goals was a new city hall, which could be a \"symbol of the people\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 123.</ref> Jonsson, a co-founder of Texas Instruments, learned about Pei from his associate Cecil Howard Green, who had recruited the architect for MIT's Earth Sciences building.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 121\u2013123.</ref>\n\nPei's approach to the new [[Dallas City Hall]] mirrored those of other projects; he surveyed the surrounding area and worked to make the building fit. In the case of Dallas, he spent days meeting with residents of the city and was impressed by their civic pride. He also found that the skyscrapers of the downtown business district dominated the skyline, and sought to create a building which could face the tall buildings and represent the importance of the public sector. He spoke of creating \"a public-private dialogue with the commercial high-rises\".<ref>Wiseman, p. 125.</ref>\n\nWorking with his associate Theodore Musho, Pei developed a design centered on a building with a top much wider than the bottom; the facade leans at an angle of 34 degrees. A plaza stretches out before the building, and a series of support columns holds it up. It was influenced by Le Corbusier's [[Government of Chandigarh|High Court building in Chandigarh]], India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 127\u2013135.</ref>\n[[File:Plylwood palace.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two dark buildings rise into the early evening sky. The tower on the right is spotted with plywood on its side.|The disastrous failure of windows on the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] required replacing them with plywood; some called it \"the world's tallest wood building\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 149.</ref>]]\n\nThe city of Dallas received the building well, and a local television news crew found unanimous approval of the new city hall when it officially opened to the public in 1978. Pei himself considered the project a success, even as he worried about the arrangement of its elements. He said: \"It's perhaps stronger than I would have liked; it's got more strength than finesse.\"<ref name=\"w136\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 136.</ref> He felt that his relative lack of experience left him without the necessary design tools to refine his vision, but the community liked the city hall enough to invite him back. Over the years he went on to design five additional buildings in the Dallas area.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\n=== Hancock Tower, Boston ===\n\nWhile Pei and Musho were coordinating the Dallas project, their associate [[Henry N. Cobb|Henry Cobb]] had taken the helm for a commission in Boston. [[John Hancock Insurance]] chairman Robert Slater hired I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners to design a building that could overshadow the [[Prudential Tower]], erected by [[Prudential Insurance|their rival]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 140 and 145.</ref>\n\nAfter the firm's first plan was discarded due to a need for more office space, Cobb developed a new plan around a towering parallelogram, slanted away from the [[Trinity Church (Boston)|Trinity Church]] and accented by a wedge cut into each narrow side. To minimize the visual impact, the building was covered in large reflective glass panels; Cobb said this would make the building a \"background and foil\" to the older structures around it.<ref>Wiseman, p. 147.</ref> When the [[200 Clarendon Street|Hancock Tower]] was finished in 1976, it was the tallest building in [[New England]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 145.</ref>\n[[File:Johnson-museum-of-art-cornell.JPG|thumb|right|alt=Herbert F. Johnson Museum at Cornell University|Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art, Cornell University]]\nSerious issues of execution became evident in the tower almost immediately. Many glass panels fractured in a windstorm during construction in 1973. Some detached and fell to the ground, causing no injuries but sparking concern among Boston residents. In response, the entire tower was reglazed with smaller panels. This significantly increased the cost of the project. Hancock sued the glass manufacturers, Libbey-Owens-Ford, as well as I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners, for submitting plans that were \"not good and workmanlike\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 150.</ref> LOF countersued Hancock for defamation, accusing Pei's firm of poor use of their materials; I.&nbsp;M. Pei & Partners sued LOF in return. All three companies settled out of court in 1981.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref>\n\nThe project became an [[Albatross (metaphor)|albatross]] for Pei's firm. Pei himself refused to discuss it for many years. The pace of new commissions slowed and the firm's architects began looking overseas for opportunities. Cobb worked in [[Australia]] and Pei took on jobs in [[Singapore]], [[Iran]], and [[Kuwait]]. Although it was a difficult time for everyone involved, Pei later reflected with patience on the experience. \"Going through this trial toughened us,\" he said. \"It helped to cement us as partners; we did not give up on each other.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== National Gallery East Building, Washington, DC ===\n\n[[File:National Gallery East Wing by Matthew Bisanz.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A large grey building rises above a stone plaza. Short square towers appear on either side of the building, and an array of irregular glass pyramids are in the middle of the plaza.|''Time'' magazine headlined its review of Pei's design for the East Building \"Masterpiece on the Mall\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 181.</ref>]]\n\nIn the mid-1960s, directors of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C., declared the need for a new building. [[Paul Mellon]], a primary benefactor of the gallery and a member of its building committee, set to work with his assistant [[J. Carter Brown]] (who became gallery director in 1969) to find an architect. The new structure would be located to the east of the original building, and tasked with two functions: offer a large space for public appreciation of various popular collections; and house office space as well as archives for scholarship and research. They likened the scope of the new facility to the [[Library of Alexandria]]. After inspecting Pei's work at the [[Des Moines Art Center]] in Iowa and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art|Johnson Museum]] at [[Cornell University]], they offered him the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 155\u2013161.</ref>\n\nPei took to the project with vigor, and set to work with two young architects he had recently recruited to the firm, William Pedersen and [[Yann Weymouth]]. Their first obstacle was the unusual shape of the building site, a [[trapezoid]] of land at the intersection of [[Constitution Avenue|Constitution]] and [[Pennsylvania Avenue (Washington, D.C.)|Pennsylvania Avenues]]. Inspiration struck Pei in 1968, when he scrawled a rough diagram of two triangles on a scrap of paper. The larger building would be the public gallery; the smaller would house offices and archives. This triangular shape became a singular vision for the architect. As the date for groundbreaking approached, Pedersen suggested to his boss that a slightly different approach would make construction easier. Pei simply smiled and said: \"No compromises.\"<ref>Wiseman, pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\nThe growing popularity of art museums presented unique challenges to the architecture. Mellon and Pei both expected large crowds of people to visit the new building, and they planned accordingly. To this end, he designed a large lobby roofed with enormous skylights. Individual galleries are located along the periphery, allowing visitors to return after viewing each exhibit to the spacious main room. A large [[Mobile (sculpture)|mobile sculpture]] by American artist [[Alexander Calder]] was later added to the lobby.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 179\u2013180.</ref> Pei hoped the lobby would be exciting to the public in the same way as the central room of the [[Solomon R.

The modern museum, he said later, \"must pay greater attention to its educational responsibility, especially to the young\".<ref>Boehm, p. 65.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nga fg04.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A large open cement room contains several people on the ground far below a balcony.

To match the look and texture of the original gallery's marble walls, builders re-opened the quarry in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], from which the first batch of stone had been harvested. The project even found and hired Malcolm Rice, a quarry supervisor who had overseen the original 1941 gallery project. The marble was cut into three-inch-thick panels and arranged over the concrete foundation, with darker blocks at the bottom and lighter blocks on top.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 177\u2013178.</ref>\n\nThe East Building was honored on 30 May 1978, two days before its public unveiling, with a black-tie party attended by celebrities, politicians, benefactors, and artists. When the building opened, popular opinion was enthusiastic. Large crowds visited the new museum, and critics generally voiced their approval. [[Ada Louise Huxtable]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Pei's building was \"a palatial statement of the creative accommodation of contemporary art and architecture\".<ref name=\"w182\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 182.</ref> The sharp angle of the smaller building has been a particular note of praise for the public; over the years it has become stained and worn from the hands of visitors.<ref>Boehm, p. 68.</ref>\n\nSome critics disliked the unusual design, however, and criticized the reliance on triangles throughout the building. Others took issue with the large main lobby, particularly its attempt to lure casual visitors. In his review for ''[[Artforum]]'', critic Richard Hennessy described a \"shocking fun-house atmosphere\" and \"aura of ancient Roman patronage\".<ref name=\"w182\" /> One of the earliest and most vocal critics, however, came to appreciate the new gallery once he saw it in person. Allan Greenberg had scorned the design when it was first unveiled, but wrote later to J. Carter Brown: \"I am forced to admit that you are right and I was wrong! The building is a masterpiece.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 183.</ref>\n\nStarting in 2005, the joints attaching the marble panels to the walls began to show signs of strain, creating a risk of panels falling off the building onto the public below.  In 2008 officials decided that it would be necessary to remove and reinstall ''all'' the panels.  The project is scheduled for completion in 2013.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703558004574581890709007568 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=An Ultramodern Building Shows Signs of Age | first=Catesby | last=Leigh | date=8 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Fragrant Hills, China ===\nAfter US President [[Richard Nixon]] made his famous [[1972 Nixon visit to China|1972 visit to China]], a wave of exchanges took place between the two countries. One of these was a delegation of the [[American Institute of Architects]] in 1974, which Pei joined. It was his first trip back to China since leaving in 1935. He was favorably received, returned the welcome with positive comments, and a series of lectures ensued. Pei noted in one lecture that since the 1950s Chinese architects had been content to imitate Western styles; he urged his audience in one lecture to search China's native traditions for inspiration.<ref>Wiseman, p. 189.</ref>\n[[File:Fragrant Hill Hotel.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A white building with ornamented windows faces a lake ringed with rock structures. Trees appear around the structure.|Pei was surprised by public resistance to his traditional design of the hotel at [[Fragrant Hills]] in China. \"Many people thought I was being reactionary,\" he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 193.</ref>]]\nIn 1978, Pei was asked to initiate a project for his home country. After surveying a number of different locations, Pei fell in love with a valley that had once served as an imperial garden and hunting preserve known as [[Fragrant Hills]]. The site housed a decrepit hotel; Pei was invited to tear it down and build a new one. As usual, he approached the project by carefully considering the context and purpose. Likewise, he considered modernist styles inappropriate for the setting. Thus, he said, it was necessary to find \"a third way\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 192; Wiseman, pp. 189\u201392.</ref>\n\nAfter visiting his ancestral home in Suzhou, Pei created a design based on some simple but nuanced techniques he admired in traditional residential Chinese buildings. Among these were abundant gardens, integration with nature, and consideration of the relationship between enclosure and opening. Pei's design included a large central atrium covered by glass panels that functioned much like the large central space in his East Building of the National Gallery. Openings of various shapes in walls invited guests to view the natural scenery beyond. Younger Chinese who had hoped the building would exhibit some of Cubist flavor for which Pei had become known were disappointed, but the new hotel found more favour with government officials and architects.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 192\u2013193.</ref>\n\nThe hotel, with 325 guest rooms and a four-story central atrium, was designed to fit perfectly into its natural habitat. The trees in the area were of special concern, and particular care was taken to cut down as few as possible. He worked with an expert from Suzhou to preserve and renovate a water maze from the original hotel, one of only five in the country. Pei was also meticulous about the arrangement of items in the garden behind the hotel; he even insisted on transporting {{convert|230|ST|t}} of rocks from a location in southwest China to suit the natural aesthetic. An associate of Pei's said later that he never saw the architect so involved in a project.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 201\u2013203.</ref>\n\nDuring construction, a series of mistakes collided with the nation's lack of technology to strain relations between architects and builders. Whereas 200&nbsp;or so workers might have been used for a similar building in the US, the Fragrant Hill project employed over 3,000&nbsp;workers. This was mostly because the construction company lacked the sophisticated machines used in other parts of the world. The problems continued for months, until Pei had an uncharacteristically emotional moment during a meeting with Chinese officials. He later explained that his actions included \"shouting and pounding the table\" in frustration.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 205.</ref> The design staff noticed a difference in the manner of work among the crew after the meeting. As the opening neared, however, Pei found the hotel still needed work. He began scrubbing floors with his wife and ordered his children to make beds and vacuum floors. The project's difficulties took an emotional and physical strain on the Pei family.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref>\n\n[[File:Javits Center 11av jeh.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A building of dark tinted glass stands over a city street. The corners of the building are smoothed at 45-degree angles.|Pei said of the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]]: \"The complications exceeded even my expectations.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 211.</ref>]]\n\nThe Fragrant Hill Hotel opened on 17 October 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff returned for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 206.</ref> The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered on the work of American [[postmodern architecture|postmodernists]] such as [[Michael Graves]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 206\u2013207.</ref>\n\n=== Javits Convention Center, New York ===\n\nAs the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei began work on the [[Jacob K. Javits Convention Center]] in New York City, for which his associate [[James Ingo Freed|James Freed]] served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in what was then a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate [[space frame]] of interconnected metal rods and spheres.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 211\u2013216.</ref>\n\nThe convention center was plagued from the start by budget problems and construction blunders. City regulations forbid a general contractor having final authority over the project, so architects and program manager Richard Kahan had to coordinate the wide array of builders, plumbers, electricians, and other workers. The forged steel globes to be used in the space frame came to the site with hairline cracks and other defects; 12,000 were rejected. These and other problems led to media comparisons with the disastrous Hancock Tower. One New York City official blamed Kahan for the difficulties, indicating that the building's architectural flourishes were responsible for delays and financial crises.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 222\u2013224.</ref> The Javits Center opened on 3 April 1986, to a generally positive reception. During the inauguration ceremonies, however, neither Freed nor Pei was recognized for their role in the project.\n\n=== [[Louvre|Le Grand Louvre]], Paris ===\n[[File:Paris 75001 Cour Napol\u00e9on Louvre Aile Turgot 02a.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A classical building with ornamental design rises above a small crowd. Rounded archways line the front of the structure.|Pei was acutely aware, as he said, that \"the history of Paris was embedded in the stones of the Louvre.\"<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\">Boehm, p. 84.</ref>]]\n\nWhen [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] was elected President of France in 1981, he laid out an ambitious plan for a variety of construction projects. One of these was the renovation of the Louvre Museum. Mitterrand appointed a civil servant named {{ill|\u00c9mile Biasini|fr}} to oversee it. After visiting museums in Europe and the United States, including the US National Gallery, he asked Pei to join the team. The architect made three secretive trips to Paris, to determine the feasibility of the project; only one museum employee knew why he was there.<ref>Wiseman, p. 233; Boehm, p. 77.</ref> Pei finally agreed that a reconstruction project was not only possible, but necessary for the future of the museum. He thus became the first foreign architect to work on the Louvre.<ref>Wiseman, p. 234.</ref>\n\nThe heart of the new design included not only a renovation of the ''Cour Napol\u00e9on'' in the midst of the buildings, but also a transformation of the interiors. Pei proposed a central entrance, not unlike the lobby of the National Gallery East Building, which would link the three major buildings. Below would be a complex of additional floors for research, storage, and maintenance purposes. At the center of the courtyard he designed a [[Louvre Pyramid|glass and steel pyramid]], first proposed with the Kennedy Library, to serve as entrance and anteroom skylight. It was mirrored by [[La Pyramide Invers\u00e9e|another inverted pyramid]] underneath, to reflect sunlight into the room. These designs were partly an homage to the fastidious geometry of the famous French landscape architect [[Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre]] (1613\u20131700).<ref>Wiseman, pp. 235\u2013236.</ref> Pei also found the pyramid shape best suited for stable transparency, and considered it \"most compatible with the architecture of the Louvre, especially with the faceted planes of its roofs\".<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\" />\n\nBiasini and Mitterrand liked the plans, but the scope of the renovation displeased Louvre director Andr\u00e9 Chabaud. He resigned from his post, complaining that the project was \"unfeasible\" and posed \"architectural risks\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 240.</ref> The public also reacted harshly to the design, mostly because of the proposed pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 249\u2013250.</ref> One critic called it a \"gigantic, ruinous gadget\";<ref name=\"w249\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 249.</ref> another charged Mitterrand with \"despotism\" for inflicting Paris with the \"atrocity\".<ref name=\"w249\" /> Pei estimated that 90&nbsp;percent of Parisians opposed his design. \"I received many angry glances in the streets of Paris,\" he said.<ref>Boehm, p. 80.</ref> Some condemnations carried [[nationalism|nationalistic]] overtones. One opponent wrote: \"I am surprised that one would go looking for a Chinese architect in America to deal with the historic heart of the capital of France.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 250.</ref>\n\n[[File:Louvre Museum Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A grey pyramid sits in the center of a courtyard, surrounded by ancient buildings.|Pei decided that a pyramid was \"most compatible\" with the other structures at the Louvre, complementing their roofs' faceted planes.<ref name=\"Boehm, p. 84\" />]]\nSoon, however, Pei and his team won the support of several key cultural icons, including the conductor [[Pierre Boulez]] and [[Claude Pompidou]], widow of former French President [[Georges Pompidou]], after whom [[Centre Georges Pompidou|another controversial museum]] was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris [[Jacques Chirac]] and placed a full-sized cable model of the pyramid in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000&nbsp;people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale of the pyramid.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 251\u2013252.</ref>\n\nTo minimize the impact of the structure, Pei demanded a method of glass production that resulted in clear panes. The pyramid was constructed at the same time as the subterranean levels below, which caused difficulties during the building stages. As they worked, construction teams came upon an abandoned set of rooms containing 25,000&nbsp;historical items; these were incorporated into the rest of the structure to add a new exhibition zone.<ref>Wiseman, p. 257.</ref>\nThe new Louvre courtyard was opened to the public on 14 October 1988, and the Pyramid entrance was opened the following March. By this time, public opinion had softened on the new installation; a poll found a fifty-six percent approval rating for the pyramid, with twenty-three percent still opposed. The newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' had vehemently criticized Pei's design, but later celebrated the tenth anniversary of its magazine supplement at the pyramid.<ref name=\"w255\">Wiseman, pp. 255\u2013259.</ref> [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] of Britain surveyed the new site with curiosity, and declared it \"marvelous, very exciting\".<ref name=\"w259\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 259.</ref> A writer in ''[[Le Quotidien de Paris]]'' wrote: \"The much-feared pyramid has become adorable.\"<ref name=\"w259\" /> The experience was exhausting for Pei, but also rewarding. \"After the Louvre,\" he said later, \"I thought no project would be too difficult.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 90.</ref> The ''[[Louvre Pyramid]]'' has become Pei's most famous structure.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ching|first=Francis|author2=Jarxombek, Mark|others=Prakash, Vikramaditya|title=A Global History of Architecture|publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc|location=New Jersey|year=2007|page=742|isbn=0-471-26892-5}}</ref>\n\n=== Meyerson Symphony Center, Dallas ===\nThe opening of the Louvre Pyramid coincided with four other projects on which Pei had been working, prompting architecture critic [[Paul Goldberger]] to declare 1989 \"the year of Pei\" in ''The New York Times''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/17/arts/architecture-view-a-year-of-years-for-the-high-priest-of-modernism.html?pagewanted=all|title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW; A Year of Years for the High Priest of Modernism|work=The New York Times |authorlink=Paul Goldberger|first=Paul|last=Goldberger|date=17 September 1989|accessdate=4 January 2010}}</ref> It was also the year in which Pei's firm changed its name to [[Pei Cobb Freed & Partners]], to reflect the increasing stature and prominence of his associates. At the age of seventy-two, Pei had begun thinking about retirement, but continued working long hours to see his designs come to light.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 263\u2013264.</ref>\n\n[[File:Dallas Meyerson Center 02.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A beige cube rises at an angle around a half-cone made of glass and steel. In front, a square archway overlooks a stone courtyard.|Although he usually designed entirely by hand, Pei used a computer to \"confirm the spaces\" for the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]] in [[Dallas]].<ref>Wiseman, p. 272.</ref>]]\nOne of the projects took Pei back to Dallas, Texas, to design the [[Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center]]. The success of city's performing artists, particularly the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] then being led by conductor [[Eduardo Mata]], led to interest by city leaders in creating a modern center for musical arts that could rival the best halls in [[Europe]]. The organizing committee contacted 45&nbsp;architects, but at first Pei did not respond, thinking that his work on the Dallas City Hall had left a negative impression. One of his colleagues from that project, however, insisted that he meet with the committee. He did and, although it would be his first concert hall, the committee voted unanimously to offer him the commission. As one member put it: \"We were convinced that we would get the world's greatest architect putting his best foot forward.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 267.</ref>\n\nThe project presented a variety of specific challenges. Because its main purpose was the presentation of live music, the hall needed a design focused on [[acoustics]] first, then public access and exterior aesthetics. To this end, a professional sound technician was hired to design the interior. He proposed a [[Shoebox style (architecture)|shoebox]] auditorium, used in the acclaimed designs of top European symphony halls such as the [[Concertgebouw|Amsterdam Concertgebouw]] and [[Musikverein|Vienna Musikverein]]. Pei drew inspiration for his adjustments from the designs of the German architect [[Johann Balthasar Neumann]], especially the [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]]. He also sought to incorporate some of the panache of the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Op\u00e9ra]] designed by [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 269\u2013270.</ref>\n\nPei's design placed the rigid shoebox at an angle to the surrounding street grid, connected at the north end to a long rectangular office building, and cut through the middle with an assortment of circles and cones. The design attempted to reproduce with modern features the acoustic and visual functions of traditional elements like [[filigree]]. The project was risky: its goals were ambitious and any unforeseen acoustic flaws would be virtually impossible to remedy after the hall's completion. Pei admitted that he did not completely know how everything would come together. \"I can imagine only 60&nbsp;percent of the space in this building,\" he said during the early stages. \"The rest will be as surprising to me as to everyone else.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 272.</ref> As the project developed, costs rose steadily and some sponsors considered withdrawing their support. Billionaire tycoon [[Ross Perot]] made a donation of US$10&nbsp;million, on the condition that it be named in honor of Morton H. Meyerson, the longtime patron of the arts in Dallas.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 273\u2013274.</ref>\n\nThe building opened and immediately garnered widespread praise, especially for its acoustics. After attending a week of performances in the hall, a music critic for ''The New York Times'' wrote an enthusiastic account of the experience and congratulated the architects. One of Pei's associates told him during a party before the opening that the symphony hall was \"a very mature building\"; he smiled and replied: \"Ah, but did I have to wait this long?\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 286.</ref>\n\n=== Bank of China, Hong Kong ===\n[[File:Bank-of-china clean-img-sma.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A tall tower coated with reflective glass and steel X patterns rises over trees and smaller buildings.|[[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]], one of Pei's most recognized works in the 1990s.]]\nA new offer had arrived for Pei from the Chinese government in 1982. With an eye toward the [[transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong]] from the British in 1997, authorities in China sought Pei's aid on a new tower for the local branch of the [[Bank of China]]. The Chinese government was preparing for a new wave of engagement with the outside world and sought a tower to represent modernity and economic strength. Given the elder Pei's history with the bank before the Communist takeover, government officials visited the 89-year-old man in New York to gain approval for his son's involvement. Pei then spoke with his father at length about the proposal. Although the architect remained pained by his experience with Fragrant Hill, he agreed to accept the commission.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 286\u2013287.</ref>\n\nThe proposed site in Hong Kong's [[Central, Hong Kong|Central District]] was less than ideal; a tangle of highways lined it on three sides. The area had also been home to a headquarters for Japanese military police during World War&nbsp;II, and was notorious for prisoner torture. The small parcel of land made a tall tower necessary, and Pei had usually shied away from such projects; in Hong Kong especially, the skyscrapers lacked any real architectural character. Lacking inspiration and unsure of how to approach the building, Pei took a weekend vacation to the family home in [[Katonah, New York]]. There he found himself experimenting with a bundle of sticks until he happened upon a cascading sequence.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 287\u2013288.</ref>\n\nPei felt that his design for the [[Bank of China Tower, Hong Kong|Bank of China Tower]] needed to reflect \"the aspirations of the Chinese people\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 288.</ref>  The design that he developed for the skyscraper was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance.   The tower was planned around a visible [[truss]] structure, which distributed stress to the four corners of the base. Using the reflective glass that had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of ''[[feng shui]]'' in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 289\u2013291.</ref> \n\nAs the tower neared completion, Pei was shocked to witness the government's massacre of unarmed civilians at the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. He wrote an opinion piece for ''The New York Times'' titled \"China Won't Ever Be the Same\", in which he said that the killings \"tore the heart out of a generation that carries the hope for the future of the country\".<ref name=\"WQ294\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 294.</ref> The massacre deeply disturbed his entire family, and he wrote that \"China is besmirched.\"<ref name=\"WQ294\" />\n\n=== 1990\u2013present: museum projects ===\n[[File:Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A grey tiled building rises over a lake, with a cylinder set on a narrow pole, and a sloping glass wall on one end.|One staff member sympathized with Pei's frustrations with the lack of organization at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], admitting that he was \"operating in a vacuum\".<ref name=\"WQ307\" />]]\n\nAs the 1990s began, Pei transitioned into a role of decreased involvement with his firm. The staff had begun to shrink, and Pei wanted to dedicate himself to smaller projects allowing for more creativity. Before he made this change, however, he set to work on his last major project as active partner: The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in Cleveland, Ohio. Considering his work on such bastions of [[high culture]] as the Louvre and US National Gallery, some critics were surprised by his association with what many considered a tribute to [[low culture]]. The sponsors of the hall, however, sought Pei for specifically this reason; they wanted the building to have an aura of respectability from the beginning. As in the past, Pei accepted the commission in part because of the unique challenge it presented.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 303\u2013306.</ref>\n\nUsing a glass wall for the entrance, similar in appearance to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated the exterior of the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered wraparounds and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide \"a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about\".<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 306.</ref>\n\nThe building opened in 1995, and was received with moderate praise. ''The New York Times'' called it \"a fine building\", but Pei was among those who felt disappointed with the results. The museum's early beginnings in New York combined with an unclear mission created a fuzzy understanding among project leaders for precisely what was needed.<ref name=\"WQ307\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 307.</ref> Although the city of Cleveland benefited greatly from the new tourist attraction, Pei was unhappy with it.<ref name=\"WQ307\" />\n\nAt the same time, Pei designed a new museum for [[Luxembourg]], the ''Mus\u00e9e d'art moderne Grand-Duc Jean'', commonly known as the [[Mudam]]. Drawing from the original shape of the [[Fort Th\u00fcngen]] walls where the museum was located, Pei planned to remove a portion of the original foundation. Public resistance to the historical loss forced a revision of his plan, however, and the project was nearly abandoned. The size of the building was halved, and it was set back from the original wall segments to preserve the foundation. Pei was disappointed with the alterations, but remained involved in the building process even during construction.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 311\u2013313.</ref>\n\nIn 1995, Pei was hired to design an extension to the ''[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]'', or German Historical Museum in Berlin. Returning to the challenge of the East Building of the US National Gallery, Pei worked to combine a modernist approach with a classical main structure. He described the glass cylinder addition as a \"beacon\",<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 315.</ref> and topped it with a glass roof to allow plentiful sunlight inside. Pei had difficulty working with German government officials on the project; their utilitarian approach clashed with his passion for aesthetics. \"They thought I was nothing but trouble\", he said.<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 316.</ref>\n\nPei also worked at this time on two projects for a [[Japanese new religions|new Japanese religious movement]] called ''[[Shinji Shumeikai]]''. He was approached by the movement's spiritual leader, Kaishu Koyama, who impressed the architect with her sincerity and willingness to give him significant artistic freedom. One of the buildings was a bell tower, designed to resemble the ''[[bachi]]'' used when playing traditional instruments like the ''[[shamisen]]''. Pei was unfamiliar with the movement's beliefs, but explored them in order to represent something meaningful in the tower. As he said: \"It was a search for the sort of expression that is not at all technical.\"<ref>Quoted in Wiseman, p. 300.</ref>\n\n[[File:Miho museum02n3872.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A curving circular tunnel opens to reveal a building with a tall sloping roof and a circular window in the front door.|Pei's tunnel through a mountain leading to the [[Miho Museum]] was partly inspired by a story from fourth-century Chinese poet [[Tao Yuanming]].<ref>Boehm, pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>]]\nThe experience was rewarding for Pei, and he agreed immediately to work with the group again. The new project was the [[Miho Museum]], to display Koyama's collection of [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] artifacts. Pei visited the site in [[Shiga Prefecture]], and during their conversations convinced Koyama to expand her collection. She conducted a global search and acquired more than 300&nbsp;items showcasing the history of the [[Silk Road]].<ref>Wiseman, pp. 317\u2013319.</ref>\n\nOne major challenge was the approach to the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, not unlike the approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80&nbsp;percent of the building underground.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 318\u2013320.</ref>\n\nWhen designing the exterior, Pei borrowed from the tradition of Japanese temples, particularly those found in nearby [[Kyoto]]. He created a concise spaceframe wrapped into French limestone and covered with a glass roof. Pei also oversaw specific decorative details, including a bench in the entrance lobby, carved from a 350-year-old ''[[Zelkova serrata|keyaki]]'' tree. Because of Koyama's considerable wealth, money was rarely considered an obstacle; estimates at the time of completion put the cost of the project at US$350&nbsp;million.<ref>Wiseman, pp. 320\u2013322.</ref>\n\nDuring the first decade of the 2000s, Pei designed a variety of buildings, including the [[Suzhou Museum]] near his childhood home.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/09/arts/design/09pei.html |title=I.

Although it was originally planned for the [[corniche]] road along Doha Bay, Pei convinced project coordinators to build a new island to provide the needed space. He then spent six months touring the region and surveying mosques in Spain, Syria, and Tunisia. He was especially impressed with the elegant simplicity of the [[Mosque of Ibn Tulun]] in Cairo.\n\nOnce again, Pei sought to combine new design elements with the classical aesthetic most appropriate for the location of the building. The rectangular boxes rotate evenly to create a subtle movement, with small arched windows at regular intervals into the limestone exterior. The museum's coordinators were pleased with the project; its official website describes its \"true splendour unveiled in the sunlight\", and speaks of \"the shades of colour and the interplay of shadows paying tribute to the essence of Islamic architecture\".<ref name=\"mia\">[http://www.mia.org.qa/en/about/the-museum-building \"The Architect: Introduction\"].

The project to build the science center was conceived in 2001 and construction started in 2006.<ref>[http://www.msc.org.mo/en/process.php Development & Construction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119133300/http://www.msc.org.mo/en/process.php |date=19 November 2011 }}, Macao Science Center.</ref> The center was completed in 2009 and opened by the Chinese President [[Hu Jintao]].<ref name=\"peopledaily\">[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90776/90785/6847062.html President Hu inaugurates Macao Science Center], ''[[People's Daily]]'', 20 December 2009.</ref>\nThe main part of the building is a distinctive conical shape with a spiral walkway and large atrium inside, similar to the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Galleries lead off the walkway, mainly consisting of interactive exhibits aimed at science education.\nThe building is in a prominent position by the sea and is now a landmark of Macau.<ref name=\"peopledaily\" />\n\n== Style and method ==\nPei's style is described as thoroughly [[modern architecture|modernist]], with significant [[cubism|cubist]] themes.<ref>Wiseman, p. 11; Boehm, pp. 45\u201346.</ref> He is known for combining traditional architectural elements with progressive designs based on simple geometric patterns. As one critic writes: \"Pei has been aptly described as combining a classical sense of form with a contemporary mastery of method.\"<ref>Heyer, p. 309.</ref> In 2000, biographer Carter Wiseman called Pei \"the most distinguished member of his Late-Modernist generation still in practice\".<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 323\">Wiseman, p. 323.</ref> At the same time, Pei himself rejects simple dichotomies of architectural trends. He once said: \"The talk about modernism versus [[postmodern architecture|post-modernism]] is unimportant. It's a side issue. An individual building, the style in which it is going to be designed and built, is not that important. The important thing, really, is the community. How does it affect life?\"<ref>Quoted in Diamonstein, p. 145.</ref>\n\nPei's work is celebrated throughout the world of architecture. His colleague [[John Portman]] once told him: \"Just once, I'd like to do something like the East Building.\"<ref name=\"WQ215\" /> But this originality does not always bring large financial reward; as Pei replied to the successful architect: \"Just once, I'd like to make the kind of money you do.\"<ref name=\"WQ215\">Quoted in Wiseman, p. 215.</ref> His concepts, moreover, are too individualized and dependent on context to give rise to a particular school of design. Pei refers to his own \"analytical approach\" when explaining the lack of a \"Pei School\". \"For me,\" he said, \"the important distinction is between a stylistic approach to the design; and an analytical approach giving the process of due consideration to time, place, and purpose&nbsp;... My analytical approach requires a full understanding of the three essential elements&nbsp;... to arrive at an ideal balance among them.\"<ref>Boehm, p. 113.</ref>\n\n== Awards and honors ==\nIn the words of his biographer, Pei has won \"every award of any consequence in his art\",<ref name=\"Wiseman, p. 323\" /> including the Arnold Brunner Award from the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] (1963), the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medals|Gold Medal]] for Architecture from the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] (1979), the [[AIA Gold Medal]] (1979), the first ''[[Praemium Imperiale]]'' for Architecture from the Japan Art Association (1989), the Lifetime Achievement Award from the [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]], the 1998 [[Edward MacDowell Medal]] in the Arts,<ref>The MacDowell Colony</ref> and the 2010 [[Royal Gold Medal]] from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]. In 1983 he was awarded the [[Pritzker Prize]], sometimes called the [[Nobel Prize]] of architecture. In its citation, the jury said: \"Ieoh Ming Pei has given this century some of its most beautiful interior spaces and exterior forms&nbsp;... His versatility and skill in the use of materials approach the level of poetry.\"<ref name=\"pritzker\">[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/1983/jury \"Jury Citation\"]     {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217132323/http://www.pritzkerprize.com/1983/jury |date=17 February 2013 }}.

as the '''i486''' or '''486''', is a higher performance follow-up to the [[Intel 80386]] [[microprocessor]]. The 80486 was introduced in 1989 and was the first tightly{{efn|The 386, 286, and even the 8086 all had overlapping fetch, decode, execution (calculation), and write back; however, '''tightly pipelined''' usually means that all stages perform their respective duties within the same length time slot. In contrast '''loosely pipelined''' implies that some kind of buffering is used to decouple the units and allow them to work more independently. Both the original 8086 and the x86-chips of today are \"loosely pipelined\" in this sense, while the 80486 and the original Pentium worked in a \"tightly pipelined\" manner for typical instructions. This included most \"[[Complex instruction set computing|CISC]]\" type instructions as well as the simple load/store-free \"[[RISC]]-like\" ones, although the most complex also used some dedicated [[microcode]] control.}} [[instruction pipeline|pipelined]] [[x86]] design as well as the first x86 chip to use more than a million transistors, due to a large on-chip cache and an integrated floating-point unit. It represents a fourth generation of [[binary compatible]] CPUs since the original [[Intel 8086|8086]] of 1978.\n\nA 50&nbsp;MHz 80486 executes around 40 million [[instructions per second]] on average and is able to reach 50&nbsp;MIPS peak performance.\n\nThe i486 does not have the usual 80-prefix because of a court ruling that prohibits trademarking numbers (such as 80486). Later, with the introduction of the [[Pentium]] brand, Intel began branding its chips with words rather than numbers.\n\n==Background==\nThe 80486 was announced at Spring [[COMDEX|Comdex]] in April 1989. At the announcement, Intel stated that samples would be available in the third quarter of 1989 and production quantities would ship in the fourth quarter of 1989.<ref>486 32-bit CPU breaks new ground in chip density and operating performance.

It has an on-chip unified instruction and data [[CPU cache|cache]], an on-chip [[floating-point unit]] (FPU) and an enhanced [[computer bus|bus]] interface unit. Due to the tight pipelining, sequences of simple instructions (such as ALU reg,reg and ALU reg,im) could sustain a single clock cycle throughput (one instruction completed every clock). These improvements yielded a rough doubling in integer ALU performance over the 386 at the same [[clock rate]]. A 16-MHz 80486 therefore had a performance similar to a 33-MHz [[Intel 80386|386]], and the older design had to reach 50&nbsp;MHz to be comparable with a 25-MHz 80486 part.{{efn|The \"low-end\" 16 and 25&nbsp;MHz 80486 parts did not use a clock multiplier and are therefore comparable to a 386/286 clock by clock.}}\n\n===Differences between i386 and i486===\n* An 8 [[Kilobyte|KB]] on-chip (level 1) [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] [[CPU cache|cache]] stores the most recently used instructions and data (16&nbsp;KB and/or [[Cache (computing)#Operation|write-back]] on some later models). The [[Intel 80386|386]] had no such internal cache but supported a slower off-chip cache (which was not a [[level 2 cache]] because there was no internal level 1 cache on the 80386).\n* Tightly coupled [[Instruction pipeline|pipelining]] completes a simple instruction like ALU ''reg,reg'' or ALU ''reg,im'' every clock cycle (after a latency of several cycles). The 386 needed two clock cycles to do this.\n* Integrated [[floating point unit|FPU]] (disabled or absent in SX models) with a dedicated [[local bus]]; together with faster algorithms on more extensive hardware than in the i387, this performs floating point calculations faster compared to the [[i386]]+[[Intel 80387|i387]] combination.\n* Improved [[Memory management unit|MMU]] performance.\n* New instructions: XADD, BSWAP, CMPXCHG, INVD, WBINVD, INVLPG.\n\nJust as in the 80386, a simple flat 4&nbsp;GB memory model could be implemented by setting all \"segment selector\" registers to a neutral value in [[protected mode]], or setting (the same) \"segment registers\" to zero in [[real mode]], and using only the 32-bit \"offset registers\" (x86-terminology for general CPU registers used as address registers) as a linear 32-bit virtual address bypassing the segmentation logic. Virtual addresses were then normally mapped onto physical addresses by the paging system except when it was disabled. (''Real'' mode had no ''virtual'' addresses.) Just as with the 80386, circumventing memory segmentation could substantially improve performance in some operating systems and applications.\n\nOn a typical PC [[motherboard]], either four matched 30-pin (8-bit) [[SIMM]]s or one 72-pin (32-bit) SIMM per bank were required to fit the 80486's 32-bit [[Bus (computing)|data bus]]. The [[address bus]] used 30-bits (A31..A2) complemented by four byte-select pins (instead of A0,A1) to allow for any 8/16/32-bit selection. This meant that the limit of directly addressable physical memory was 4&nbsp;[[gigabyte]]s as well (2<sup>30</sup> ''32-bit'' words = 2<sup>32</sup> ''8-bit'' words).\n\n==Models==\nThere are several suffixes and variants. (see Table). Other variants include:\n* ''[[RapidCAD|Intel RapidCAD]]'': a specially packaged Intel 486DX and a dummy [[floating-point unit]] (FPU) designed as pin-compatible replacements for an [[Intel 80386]] processor and [[Intel 80387|80387]] FPU.\n* ''i486SL-NM'': i486SL based on i486SX.\n* ''[[Intel 80487SX|i487SX (P23N)]]'': i486DX with one extra pin sold as an FPU upgrade to i486SX systems; When the i487SX was installed, it ensured that an i486SX was present on the [[motherboard]] but disabled it, taking over all of its functions.\n* ''[[Intel 80486 OverDrive|i486 OverDrive (P23T/P24T)]]'': i486SX, i486SX2, i486DX2 or i486DX4. Marked as upgrade processors, some models had different pinouts or voltage-handling abilities from \"standard\" chips of the same speed stepping. Fitted to a coprocessor or \"OverDrive\" socket on the motherboard, worked the same as the i487SX.\n\nThe specified maximal internal clock frequency (on Intel's versions) ranged from 16 to 100&nbsp;MHz. The 16&nbsp;MHz i486SX model was used by [[Dell Computers]].\n\nOne of the few 80486 models specified for a 50&nbsp;MHz bus (486DX-50) initially had overheating problems and was moved to the 0.8-micrometre fabrication process. However, problems continued when the 486DX-50 was installed in local-bus systems due to the high bus speed, making it rather unpopular with mainstream consumers, as local-bus video was considered a requirement at the time, though it remained popular with users of EISA systems. The 486DX-50 was soon eclipsed by the clock-doubled [[Intel 80486DX2|i486DX2]], which instead ran the CPU logic at twice the external bus speed, actually being slower due to the bus running at only 25 or 33&nbsp;MHz\n\nMore powerful 80486 iterations such as the OverDrive and DX4 were less popular (the latter available as an OEM part only), as they came out after Intel had released the next-generation [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] processor family. Certain steppings of the DX4 also officially supported 50&nbsp;MHz bus operation, but it was a seldom used feature.\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! || Model || CPU/bus<br>clock speed || [[VCore|Voltage]] || [[L1 cache]]* || Introduced \n! width=\"520px\" | Notes\n|-\n| [[File:Intel i486 DX 25MHz SX328.jpg|center|80px]][[File:Intel i486 DX-33.jpg|center|80px]][[File:Intel i486 dx 50mhz 2007 03 27.jpg|center|80px]] || i486DX (P4) || 20, 25&nbsp;MHz<br />33&nbsp;MHz<br />50&nbsp;MHz || 5 V || 8&nbsp;KB WT || April 1989<br />May 1990<br />June 1991 || The original chip without clock multiplier\n|-\n| {{Anchor|486SL}}[[File:KL Intel 486SL.jpg|center|80px]] || i486SL || 20, 25, 33&nbsp;MHz || 5 V or 3.3 V || 8&nbsp;KB WT || November 1992 || Low-power version of the i486DX, reduced VCore, SMM ([[System Management Mode]]), stop clock, and power-saving features \u2014 mainly for use in portable computers\n|-\n| [[File:Intel i486 sx 33mhz 2007 03 27.jpg|center|80px]] || i486SX (P23) || 16, 20, 25&nbsp;MHz<br />33&nbsp;MHz || 5 V || 8&nbsp;KB WT || September 1991<br />September 1992 || An i486DX with the FPU part disabled or missing.

Some were clones (identical at the microarchitectural level), others were [[clean room design|clean room implementations]] of the Intel instruction-set. (IBM's multiple source requirement is one of the reasons behind its x86-manufacturing since the 80286.)  The 80486 was, however, covered by many of Intel's patents covering new R&D as well as that of the prior 80386.  Intel and IBM have broad cross-licenses of these patents, and AMD was granted rights to the relevant patents in the 1995 settlement of a lawsuit between the companies.<ref>{{cite web|title=AMD-Intel Litigation History|url=https://yannalaw.com/services/trials-litigation/litigation-cottage-industry/amd-intel-litigation/|website=yannalaw.com}}</ref>\n\nAMD produced several clones of the 80486 using a 40&nbsp;MHz bus (486DX-40, 486DX/2-80, and 486DX/4-120) which had no equivalent available from Intel, as well as a part specified for 90&nbsp;MHz, using a 30&nbsp;MHz external clock, that was sold only to OEMs. The fastest running 80486 CPU, the [[Am5x86]], ran at 133&nbsp;MHz and was released by AMD in 1995. 150&nbsp;MHz and 160&nbsp;MHz parts were planned but never officially released.\n\nCyrix made a variety of 80486-compatible processors, positioned at the cost-sensitive desktop and low-power (laptop) markets.  Unlike AMD's 80486 clones, the Cyrix processors were the result of clean-room reverse-engineering. Cyrix's early offerings included the 486DLC and 486SLC, two hybrid chips which plugged into 386DX or SX sockets respectively, and offered 1&nbsp;KB of cache (versus 8&nbsp;KB for the then-current Intel/AMD parts). Cyrix also made \"real\" 80486 processors, which plugged into the i486's socket and offered 2 or 8&nbsp;KB of cache. Clock-for-clock, the Cyrix-made chips were generally slower than their Intel/AMD equivalents, though later products with 8&nbsp;KB caches were more competitive, if late to market.\n\nThe [[Motorola 68040]], while not compatible with the 80486, was often positioned as the 80486's equivalent in features and performance. Clock-for-clock basis the [[Motorola 68040]] could significantly outperform the Intel 80486 chip.<ref>{{cite web|title=CISC: The Intel 80486 vs. The Motorola MC68040|url=http://textfiles.meulie.net/computers/486vs040.txt|accessdate=May 20, 2013|date=July 1992}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bbs.ingedigit.com.ve/TechInfo/68040.Microprocessor.html 68040 Microprocessor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216013510/http://www.bbs.ingedigit.com.ve/TechInfo/68040.Microprocessor.html |date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref> However, the 80486 had the ability to be clocked significantly faster without suffering from overheating problems. The [[Motorola 68040]] performance lagged behind the later production 80486 systems.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Motherboards and buses==\n[[File:Byte magazine September 1989 cover.png|thumb|200px|The [[Apricot Computers|first 80486 system from Britain]] on the cover of BYTE, September 1989]]\nEarly 80486 machines were equipped with several [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] slots (using an [[emulated]] PC/AT-bus) and sometimes one or two [[8-bit]]\u2013only slots (compatible with the PC/XT-bus).{{efn|In general, 8-bit ISA slots in these systems were implemented just by leaving off the shorter \"C\"/\"D\" connector of the slot, though the copper traces for a 16-bit slot were still there on the motherboard; the computer could tell no difference between an 8-bit ISA adapter in such a slot and the same adapter in a 16-bit slot, and there were still enough 8-bit adapters in circulation that vendors figured they could save money on a few connectors this way. Also, leaving off the 16-bit extension to the ISA connector allowed use of some early 8-bit ISA cards that otherwise could not be used due to the PCB \"skirt\" hanging down into that 16-bit extension space. IBM was the first to do this in the IBM AT.}} Many [[motherboard]]s enabled overclocking of these up from the default 6 or 8&nbsp;MHz to perhaps 16.7 or 20&nbsp;MHz (half the i486 bus clock) in a number of steps, often from within the [[BIOS]] setup. Especially older peripheral cards normally worked well at such speeds as they often used standard MSI chips instead of slower (at the time) custom VLSI designs. This could give significant performance gains (such as for old video cards moved from a 386 or 286 computer, for example). However, operation beyond 8 or 10&nbsp;MHz could sometimes lead to stability problems, at least in systems equipped with SCSI or sound cards.\n\nSome motherboards came equipped with a 32-bit bus called [[Extended Industry Standard Architecture|EISA]] that was backward compatible with the ISA-standard. EISA offered a number of attractive features such as increased bandwidth, extended addressing, IRQ sharing, and card configuration through software (rather than through jumpers, DIP switches, etc.) However, EISA cards were expensive and therefore mostly employed in servers and workstations. Consumer desktops often used the simpler but faster [[VESA Local Bus]] (VLB), unfortunately somewhat prone to electrical and timing-based instability; typical consumer desktops had ISA slots combined with a single VLB slot for a video card. VLB was gradually replaced by [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] during the final years of the 80486 period. Few [[Pentium class]] motherboards had VLB support as VLB was based directly on the i486 bus; it was no trivial matter adapting it to the quite different P5 Pentium-bus. ISA persisted through the P5 Pentium generation and was not completely displaced by PCI until the Pentium III era.\n\nLate 80486 boards were normally equipped with both PCI and ISA slots, and sometimes a single VLB slot as well. In this configuration VLB or PCI throughput suffered depending on how buses were bridged. Initially, the VLB slot in these systems was usually fully compatible only with video cards (quite fitting as \"VESA\" stands for ''[[VESA|Video Electronics Standards Association]]''); VLB-IDE, multi I/O, or SCSI cards could have problems on motherboards with PCI slots. The VL-Bus operated at the same clock speed as the i486-bus (basically ''being'' a local 80486-bus) while the PCI bus also usually depended on the i486 clock but sometimes had a divider setting available via the BIOS. This could be set to 1/1 or 1/2, sometimes even 2/3 (for 50&nbsp;MHz CPU clocks). Some motherboards limited the PCI clock to the specified maximum of 33&nbsp;MHz and certain network cards depended on this frequency for correct bit-rates. The ISA clock was typically generated by a divider of the CPU/VLB/PCI clock (as implied above).\n\nOne of the earliest complete systems to use the 80486 chip was the Apricot VX FT, produced by United Kingdom hardware manufacturer [[Apricot Computers]]. Even overseas in the United States it was popularised as \"The World's First 80486\" in the September 1989 issue of [[Byte (magazine)|''Byte'' magazine]] (shown right).\n\nLater 80486 boards also supported [[Plug-And-Play]], a specification designed by [[Microsoft]] that began as a part of [[Windows 95]] to make component installation easier for consumers.\n\n==Gaming==\n{{original research|section|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe 486DX2 66&nbsp;MHz processor was popular on home-oriented PCs during the early to mid 1990s, toward the end of the [[MS-DOS]] gaming era. It was often coupled with a [[VESA Local Bus]] video card.\n\nThe introduction of [[3D computer graphics]] spelled the end of the 80486's reign, because 3D graphics make heavy use of [[floating-point]] calculations and require a faster [[CPU cache]] and more [[memory bandwidth]]. Developers began to target the [[P5 (microarchitecture)|P5]] Pentium processor family almost exclusively with [[x86 assembly language]] optimizations (e.g., ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'') which led to the usage of terms like \"[[Pentium-compatible processor]]\" for software requirements. Many of these games required the speed of the P5 Pentium processor family's double-pipelined architecture.\n<!-- This section could generally use citations; I think most of these facts could be verified by reference to trade magazines of the time, such as BYTE, PC Magazine, or PC World. -->\n\n==Obsolescence==\nThe [[AMD Am5x86]], up to 133&nbsp;MHz, and [[Cyrix Cx5x86]], up to 120&nbsp;MHz, were the last 80486 processors that were often used in late generation 80486 motherboards with PCI slots and 72-pin SIMMs that are designed to be able to run Windows 95, and also often used as upgrades for older 80486 motherboards. While the [[Cyrix Cx5x86]] faded quite quickly when the [[Cyrix 6x86]] took over, the [[AMD Am5x86]] was important during the time when the [[AMD K5]] was delayed.\n\nIn the general-purpose desktop computer role, 80486-based machines remained in use into the early 2000s, especially as Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT 4.0 were the latest Microsoft operating systems to officially support installation on a 80486-based system.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/182751 |title = Minimum Hardware Requirements for a Windows 98 Installation |date = January 24, 2001 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20041205061101/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/182751 |archivedate = December 5, 2004 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.winhistory.de/more/nt4.htm |title = Windows NT 4.0 Workstation |publisher = WinHistory.de |language=de}}</ref>  However, as Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4.0 were eventually overtaken by newer operating systems, 80486 systems likewise fell out of use. Still, a number of 80486 machines have remained in use today, mostly for backward compatibility with older programs (most notably games), especially since many of them have problems running on newer operating systems. However, [[DOSBox]] is also available for current operating systems and provides emulation of the 80486 instruction set, as well as full compatibility with most DOS-based programs.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.dosbox.com/wiki/System_Requirements |title = System Requirements |publisher = DOSBox.com }}</ref>\n\nAlthough the 80486 was eventually overtaken by the Pentium for [[personal computer]] applications, Intel had continued production for use in [[embedded systems]].

It was intended as a lower-cost CPU for use in low-end systems. Computer manufacturers that used these processors include [[Packard Bell]], [[Compaq]], [[Zeos|ZEOS]] and [[IBM]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nIn the early 1990s, common applications did not need or benefit from an FPU. Among the rare exceptions were [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] applications, which could often simulate floating point operations in software, but benefited from a hardware floating point unit immensely. AMD had begun manufacturing its 386DX clone which was faster than Intel's. To respond to this new situation Intel wanted to provide a lower cost i486 CPU for system integrators, but without sacrificing the better profit margins of a \"full\" i486. This was accomplished through a debug feature called Disable Floating Point (DFP), by grounding a certain bond wire in the CPU package. The i486SX was introduced in mid-1991, 18 months after the i486DX. Later (late 1992) versions of the i486SX had the FPU entirely removed for cost cutting reasons.<ref name=\"os2museum\">{{cite web|url=http://www.os2museum.com/wp/lies-damn-lies-and-wikipedia/|title=Lies, Damn Lies, and Wikipedia OS/2 Museum|first=Michal|last=Necasek|work=OS/2 Museum|date=December 26, 2015|accessdate=December 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nSome systems allowed the user to upgrade the i486SX to a CPU with the FPU enabled. The upgrade was shipped as the [[Intel 80487|i487]], which was a full blown i486DX chip with an extra pin. The extra pin prevents the chip from being installed incorrectly. The NC# pin, one of the standard 168 pins, was used to shut off the i486SX.<ref name=\"os2museum\" /> Although i486SX devices were not used at all when the i487 was installed, they were hard to remove because the i486SX was typically installed in non-[[Zero insertion force|ZIF]] sockets or in a plastic package that was surface mounted on the motherboard.\n\n==Gallery==\n\n<gallery>\nFile:I486sx.jpg|Pin side of an Intel i486 SX\nFile:KL_Intel_i486SX_PQFP.jpg|Embedded i486SX ([[Quad Flat Package|SQFP]] version).\nFile:Intel i486SX-25.jpg|[[Quad Flat Package|BQFP]] version.\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{FOLDOC}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.cpu-collection.de/?l0=co&l1=Intel&l2=i486%20SX Intel 80486SX images and descriptions at cpu-collection.de]\n'''Intel Datasheets'''\n* [http://datasheets.chipdb.org/Intel/x86/486/datashts/27276902.PDF Embedded i486SX]\n* [http://datasheets.chipdb.org/Intel/x86/486/datashts/27273101.pdf Embedded Ultra-Low Power i486SX]\n\n{{Intel processors|discontinued}}\n\n[[Category:Intel x86 microprocessors|80486Sx]]\n\n[[de:Intel i486#i486SX]]", "sha1": "4705cgo67n6ttj7o8nmqc9g92g5d48t"}}, {"title": "Ivory", "ns": "0", "id": "15165", "revision": {"id": "865433944", "parentid": "865433939", "timestamp": "2018-10-23T22:46:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "ClueBot NG", "id": "13286072"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverting possible vandalism by [[Special:Contribs/210.55.227.159|210.55.227.159]] to version by SamHolt6.

Ivory was often used to form the white of the eyes of statues.\n\nThere is some evidence of either whale or walrus ivory used by the ancient Irish. [[Solinus]], a Roman writer in the 3rd century claimed that the Celtic peoples in Ireland would decorate their sword-hilts with the 'teeth of beasts that swim in the sea'. [[Adomnan of Iona]] wrote a story about [[St Columba]] giving a sword decorated with carved ivory as a gift that a penitent would bring to his master so he could redeem himself from slavery.<ref>Adomnan of Iona.

Early reference to the Chinese export of ivory is recorded after the Chinese [[explorer]] [[Zhang Qian]] ventured to the west to form alliances to enable the eventual free movement of Chinese goods to the west; as early as the first century BC, ivory was moved along the [[Northern Silk Road]] for consumption by western nations.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hogan, C.

Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai</ref>\n\nThe Buddhist cultures of [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]], traditionally harvested ivory from their domesticated elephants. Ivory was prized for containers due to its ability to keep an airtight seal. It was also commonly carved into elaborate seals utilized by officials to \"sign\" documents and decrees by stamping them with their unique official seal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/articles/thai-ivory/index.html|publisher=Asianart.com|author=Daniel Stiles|title=Ivory Carving in Thailand|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref>\n\nIn Southeast Asian countries, where Muslim Malay peoples live, such as [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and the [[Philippines]], ivory was the material of choice for making the handles of [[kris]] daggers. \nIn the Philippines, ivory was also used to craft the faces and hands of Catholic icons and images of saints prevalent in the [[Santo (art)|Santero]] culture.\n\nTooth and tusk ivory can be carved into a vast variety of shapes and objects. Examples of modern carved ivory objects are [[okimono]], [[netsuke]]s, jewelry, flatware handles, furniture inlays, and piano keys. Additionally, [[warthog]] tusks, and teeth from [[sperm whale]]s, [[orca]]s and hippos can also be scrimshawed or superficially carved, thus retaining their morphologically recognizable shapes.\n\nIvory usage in the last thirty years has moved towards mass production of souvenirs and jewelry. In Japan, the increase in wealth sparked consumption of solid ivory ''[[Hanko (stamp)|hanko]]'' \u2013 name seals \u2013 which before this time had been made of wood. These ''hanko'' can be carved out in a matter of seconds using machinery and were partly responsible for massive African elephant decline in the 1980s, when the African elephant population went from 1.3 million to around 600,000 in ten years.<ref name=\"To Save\"/><ref name=\"A System\">EIA (1989).

In the ten years preceding a decision in 1989 by [[CITES]] to ban international trade in African elephant ivory, the population of African elephants declined from 1.3 million to around 600,000. It was found by investigators from the [[Environmental Investigation Agency]] (EIA) that CITES sales of stockpiles from Singapore and Burundi (270 tonnes and 89.5 tonnes respectively) had created a system that increased the value of ivory on the international market, thus rewarding international smugglers and giving them the ability to control the trade and continue smuggling new ivory.<ref name=\"To Save\"/><ref name=\"A System\"/>\n\nSince the ivory ban, some [[Southern Africa]]n countries have claimed their elephant populations are stable or increasing, and argued that ivory sales would support their conservation efforts. Other African countries oppose this position, stating that renewed ivory trading puts their own elephant populations under greater threat from [[poacher]]s reacting to demand. CITES allowed the sale of 49 tonnes of ivory from Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana in 1997 to Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hsi.org/assets/pdfs/Elephant_Related_Trade_Timeline.pdf|format=PDF|title=HSI Ivory trade timeline|publisher=Hsi.org|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref><ref>\"Living Proof\", Dave Currey & Helen Moore, A report by Environmental Investigation Agency Sept 1994</ref>\n\nIn 2007, under pressure from the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]], [[eBay]] banned all international sales of elephant-ivory products. The decision came after several mass slaughters of African elephants, most notably the [[2006 Zakouma elephant slaughter]] in [[Chad]]. The IFAW found that up to 90% of the elephant-ivory transactions on eBay violated their own wildlife policies and could potentially be illegal. In October 2008, eBay expanded the ban, disallowing any sales of ivory on eBay.\n\nA more recent sale in 2008 of 108 tonnes from the three countries and South Africa took place to Japan and China.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Economist |title=Campaigners fear for elephants and their own credibility |date=July 2008 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/11751304}}</ref><ref>CITES summary record of Standing Committee 57 2008</ref> The inclusion of China as an \"approved\" importing country created enormous controversy, despite being supported by CITES, the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Traffic (conservation programme)|Traffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traffic.org/home/2008/10/28/first-ivory-auction-from-southern-africa-takes-place.html|title=Ivory sales|publisher=Traffic|date=2008-10-28|accessdate=2017-11-03}}</ref> They argued that China had controls in place and the sale might depress prices.

wheeled APC, the [[BTR-152]], had been designed as early as the late 1940s.<ref name=Guardia /> Early versions of both these lightly armored vehicles were open-topped and carried only general-purpose machine guns for armament.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> As Soviet strategists became more preoccupied with the possibility of a war involving [[weapons of mass destruction]], they became convinced of the need to deliver mounted troops to a battlefield without exposing them to the radioactive fallout from an atomic weapon.<ref name=Guardia /> The IFV concept was received favorably because it would enable a Soviet infantry squad to fight from inside their vehicles when operating in contaminated environments.<ref name=Guardia /> [[BMP development|Design work on a new tracked IFV]] began in the late 1950s and the first prototype appeared as the ''Obyekt 765'' in 1961.<ref name=Guardia /> After the Soviets had evaluated and rejected a number of other wheeled and tracked prototypes, the ''Obyekt 765'' was accepted for service; it entered serial production as the [[BMP-1]] in 1966.<ref name=Guardia /> In addition to being amphibious and superior in cross-country mobility to its predecessors, the BMP-1 carried a [[2A28 Grom|73mm smoothbore cannon]], a co-axial [[PK machine gun|PKT machine gun]], and a launcher for [[9M14 Malyutka]] anti-tank missiles.<ref name=Guardia /> Its hull was also heavily armored enough to resist .50 caliber armor-piercing ammunition along its frontal arc.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> Eight firing ports and vision blocks allowed the embarked infantry squad to observe and engage targets with rifles or machine guns.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> The BMP-1 was so heavily armed and armored that it was widely regarded as having combined the qualities of a [[light tank]] with those of the traditional APC.<ref name=Russia>{{cite book|last=Rodgers|first=Russell|editor-first=Timothy|editor-last=Dowling|title=Russia at War: From the Mongol Conquest to Afghanistan, Chechnya,

the Western trend of fitting IFVs with automatic cannon, which were more suitable for engaging low-flying aircraft, light armor, and dismounted personnel.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> About 20,000 BMP-1s were produced in the Soviet Union from 1966 to 1983,<ref name=Russia /> at which time it was regarded as the most ubiquitous IFV in the world.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> In Soviet service, the BMP-1 was ultimately superseded by the more sophisticated [[BMP-2]] and the [[BMP-3]].<ref name=Russia /> A similar design known as the [[BMD-1]] was designed to accompany Soviet airborne infantry and for a number of years was the world's only airborne IFV.<ref name=\"USMC\" />\n\nIn 1971 the Bundeswehr adopted the [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]], which became increasingly heavily armored through its successive marks and like the BMP was later fitted as standard with a launcher for anti-tank guided missiles.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> Between 1973 and 1975, the French and Yugoslav armies developed the [[AMX-10P]] and [[BVP M-80]], respectively, which were the first amphibious IFVs to appear outside the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> The Marder, AMX-10P, and M-80 were all armed with similar 20&nbsp;mm

Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4728-1743-3}}</ref> Unlike European IFVs, the Ratel was not designed to allow mounted infantrymen to fight in concert with tanks but rather to operate independently across vast distances.<ref name=Harmse /> South African officials chose a very simple, economical design because it helped reduce the significant logistical commitment necessary to keep heavier combat vehicles operational in undeveloped areas.<ref name=Harmse /> Excessive track wear was also an issue in the region's abrasive, sandy terrain, making the Ratel's wheeled configuration more attractive.<ref name=Harmse /> The Ratel was typically armed with a 20&nbsp;mm autocannon featuring what was then a unique twin-linked ammunition feed, allowing its gunner to rapidly switch between armor-piercing or high-explosive ammunition.<ref name=Harmse /> Other variants were also fitted with mortars, a bank of anti-tank guided missiles, or a 90&nbsp;mm cannon.<ref name=SurviveRide /> Most notably, the Ratel was the first mine-protected IFV; it had a blastproof hull and was built to withstand the explosive force of anti-tank mines favored by local insurgents.<ref name=SurviveRide /> Like the BMP-1, the Ratel proved to be a major watershed in IFV development, albeit for different reasons: until its debut wheeled IFV designs were evaluated unfavorably, since they lacked the weight-carrying capacity and off-road mobility of tracked vehicles, and their wheels were more vulnerable to hostile fire.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> However, during the 1970s improvements in power trains, suspension technology, and tires had increased their potential strategic mobility.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> Reduced production, operation, and maintenance costs also helped make wheeled IFVs attractive to several nations.<ref name=\"USMC\" />\n\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s, the [[US Army]] had gradually abandoned its attempts to utilize the M113 as an IFV and refocused on creating a dedicated IFV design able to match the BMP.<ref name=Guardia /> Although considered reliable, the M113 chassis did not meet the necessary requirements for protection or stealth.<ref name=Guardia /> The US also considered the M113 too heavy and slow to serve as an IFV capable of keeping pace with tanks.<ref name=Guardia /> Its [[MICV-65]] program produced a number of unique prototypes, none of which were accepted for service owing to concerns about speed, armor protection, and weight.<ref name=Guardia /> US Army evaluation staff were sent to Europe to review the AMX-10P and the Marder, both of which were rejected due to high cost, insufficient armor, or lackluster amphibious capabilities.<ref name=Guardia />\n[[File:Pi111804a1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2 Bradley]] in US service.]]\nIn 1973, the [[FMC Corporation]] developed and tested the XM723, which was a 21-ton tracked chassis which could accommodate three crew members and eight passengers.<ref name=Guardia /> It initially carried a single 20&nbsp;mm autocannon in a one-man turret<ref name=Guardia /> but in 1976 a two-man turret was introduced; this carried a 25&nbsp;mm autocannon, a co-axial machine gun, and a [[BGM-71 TOW|TOW]] anti-tank missile launcher.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> The XM723 possessed amphibious capability, nine firing ports, and spaced laminate armor on its hull.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> It was accepted for service with the US Army in 1980 as the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle]].<ref name=\"USMC\" /> Successive variants have been retrofitted with improved missile systems, gas particulate filter systems, Kevlar spall liners, and increased stowage.<ref name=Guardia /> The amount of space taken up by the hull and stowage modifications has reduced the number of passengers to six.<ref name=Guardia />\n\nBy 1982 30,000 IFVs had entered service worldwide, and the IFV concept appeared in the doctrines of 30 national armies.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> The popularity of the IFV was increased by the growing trend on the part of many nations to mechanize armies previously dominated by light infantry.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> However, contrary to expectation the IFV did not render APCs obsolete.<ref name=\"MICV\" /> The US, Russian, French, and German armies have all retained large fleets of IFVs and APCs, finding the APC more suitable for multi-purpose or auxiliary roles.<ref name=\"MICV\" /> The [[British Army]] was one of the few Western armies which had neither recognized a niche for IFVs nor adopted a dedicated IFV design by the late 1970s.<ref name=\"USMC\" /> In 1980, it made the decision to adopt a new tracked armored vehicle, the [[Warrior tracked armoured vehicle|FV510 Warrior]].<ref name=\"USMC\" /> While normally classified as an IFV, the Warrior fills the role of an APC in British service and infantrymen do not remain embarked during combat.<ref name=\"USMC\" />\n\n== Doctrine ==\n\nThe role of the IFV is closely linked to mechanized infantry doctrine.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> While some IFVs are armed with an organic direct fire gun or anti-tank guided missiles for close infantry support, they are not intended to assault armored and mechanized forces with any type of infantry on their own, mounted or not.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> Rather, the IFV's role is to give an infantry unit tactical and strategic mobility during [[combined arms]] operations.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> Most IFVs either complement tanks as part of an armored battalion, brigade, or division; others perform traditional infantry missions supported by tanks.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> Early development of IFVs in a number of Western nations was promoted primarily by armor officers who wanted to integrate tanks with supporting infantry in armored divisions.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> There were a few exceptions to the rule: for example, the Bundeswehr's decision to adopt the SPz 12-13 was largely due to the experiences of [[Wehrmacht]] [[Panzergrenadier|panzergrenadier]]s who had been inappropriately ordered to undertake combat operations better suited for armor.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> Hence, the Bundeswehr concluded that infantry should only fight while mounted in their own armored vehicles, ideally supported by tanks.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> This doctrinal trend was later subsumed into the armies of other Western nations, including the US, leading to the widespread conclusion that IFVs should be confined largely to assisting the forward momentum of tanks.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> The Soviet Army granted more flexibility in this regard to its IFV doctrine, allowing for the mechanized infantry to occupy terrain that compromised an enemy defense, carry out flanking movements, or lure armor into ill-advised counterattacks.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> While they still performed an auxiliary role to tanks, the notion of using IFVs in these types of engagements dictated that they be heavily armed, which was reflected in the BMP-1 and its successors.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> Additionally, Soviet airborne doctrine made use of the BMD series of IFVs to operate in concert with paratroops rather than traditional mechanized or armored formations.<ref name=\"USMC\"/>\n\nIFVs assumed a new significance after the [[Yom Kippur War]].<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> In addition to heralding the combat debut of the BMP-1, that conflict demonstrated the newfound significance of anti-tank guided missiles and the obsolescence of independent armored attacks.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> More emphasis was placed on combined arms offensives, and the importance of mechanized infantry to support tanks reemerged.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> As a result of the Yom Kippur War, the Soviet Union attached more infantry to its armored formations and the US accelerated its long-delayed IFV development program.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> An IFV capable of accompanying tanks for the purpose of suppressing anti-tank weapons and the hostile infantry which operated them was seen as necessary to avoid the devastation wreaked on purely armored Israeli formations.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/>\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:GCV Infantry Fighting Vehicle.jpg|thumb|right|Typical configuration of a tracked Infantry Fighting Vehicle]]\n\nThe US Army defines all vehicles classed as IFVs as having three essential characteristics: they are armed with at least a medium-caliber cannon or automatic grenade launcher, at least sufficiently protected against [[small arms]] fire, and possess off-road mobility.<ref name=\"Arms\">{{cite book | title =

name=\"Arms\"/>\n\n=== Protection ===\n\nAll IFVs possess armored hulls protected against rifle and machine gun fire.<ref name=\"Arms\"/> Most have lighter armor than [[main battle tank]]s to ensure mobility.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> Armies have generally accepted risk in reduced protection to recapitalize on an IFV's mobility, weight and speed.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> Their fully enclosed hulls offer protection from artillery fragments and residual environmental contaminants as well as limit exposure time to the mounted infantry during extended movements over open ground.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> Many IFVs also have sharply angled hulls that offer a relatively high degree of protection for their armor thickness.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> The BMP, [[Boragh]], BVP M-80, and their respective variants all possess steel hulls with a distribution of armor and steep angling that protect them during frontal advances.<ref name=Guardia/> The BMP-1 was vulnerable to heavy machine gun at close range on its flanks or rear, leading to a variety of more heavily armored marks appearing from 1979 onward.<ref name=Guardia/> The Bradley possessed a lightweight aluminum alloy hull, which in most successive marks has been bolstered by the addition of explosive reactive and slat armor, spaced laminate belts, and steel track skirts.<ref name=Guardia/> Throughout its life cycle, an IFV is expected to gain 30% more weight from armor additions.<ref name=\"IFV obesity\">{{cite book|title=Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies|year=2004|publisher=Method

[[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric conflict]]s become more common, an increasing concern with regards to IFV protection has been adequate countermeasures against [[land mine]]s and [[improvised explosive device]]s.<ref name=Guardia/> During the [[Iraq War]], inadequate mine protection in US Bradleys forced their crews to resort to makeshift strategies such as lining the hull floors with sandbags.<ref name=Guardia/> A few IFVs, such as the Ratel, have been specifically engineered to resist mine explosions.<ref name=SurviveRide/>\n\n===Armament===\nIFVs may be armed with 20mm to 57mm automatic cannon, 73mm to 100mm low or medium velocity guns, anti-tank guided missiles, or automatic grenade launchers.<ref name=\"Arms\"/>\n\nWith a few exceptions, such as the BMP-1 and the BMP-3, designs such as the [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] and the [[BMP-2]] have set the trend of arming IFVs with an autocannon suitable for use against lightly armored vehicles, low-flying aircraft, and dismounted infantry.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> This reflected the growing inclination to view IFVs as auxiliaries of armored formations: a small or medium caliber autocannon was perceived as an ideal suppressive weapon to complement large caliber tank fire.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> IFVs armed with miniature tank guns did not prove popular because many of the roles they were expected to perform were better performed by accompanying tanks.<ref name=\"USMC\"/><ref name=\"Coffey\"/> \n\nThe BMP-1, which was the first IFV to carry a relatively large gun, came under criticism during the Yom Kippur War for its mediocre individual accuracy, due in part to the low velocities of its projectiles.<ref name=Guardia/> During the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]], BMP-1 crews also complained that their armament lacked the elevation necessary to engage insurgents in mountainous terrain.<ref name=Guardia/> The effectiveness of large caliber, low-velocity guns like the [[2A28 Grom]] on the BMP-1 and BMD-1 was also much reduced by the appearance of [[Chobham armour|Chobham armor]] on Western tanks.<ref name=Guardia/> The Ratel, which included a variant armed with a 90mm low-velocity gun, was utilized in South African combat operations against [[Angola]]n and [[Cuba]]n armored formations during the [[South African Border War]], with mixed results.<ref name=\"Lessons\">{{cite web|title=The Lessons of the

African commanders to utilize them as light tanks rather than in their intended role of infantry support.<ref name=\"Lessons\"/>\n[[File:Marder1A3.5.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Marder (IFV)|Marder]] fires a [[MILAN]] anti-tank missile.]]\nAnother design feature of the BMP-1 did prove more successful in establishing a precedent for future IFVs: its inclusion of an anti-tank missile system.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> This consisted of a rail-launcher firing 9M14 Malyutka missiles which had to be reloaded manually from outside the BMP's turret.<ref name=Guardia/> Crew members had to expose themselves to enemy fire to reload the missiles, and they could not guide them effectively from inside the confines of the turret space.<ref name=Guardia/> The BMP-2 and later variants of the BMP-1 made use of semiautonomous guided missile systems.<ref name=Guardia/> In 1978, the Bundeswehr became the first Western army to embrace this trend when it retrofitted all its Marders with launchers for [[MILAN]] anti-tank missiles.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> The US Army added a launcher for TOW anti-tank missiles to its fleet of Bradleys, despite the fact that this greatly reduced the interior space available for seating the embarked infantry.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/> This was justified on the basis that the Bradley needed to not only engage and destroy other IFVs, but support tanks in the destruction of other tanks during combined arms operations.<ref name=\"Coffey\"/>\n\n===Mobility===\n\nIFVs are designed to have the strategic and tactical mobility necessary to keep pace with tanks during rapid maneuvers.<ref name=\"Arms\"/> Some, like the BMD series, have airborne and amphibious capabilities.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> IFVs may be either wheeled or tracked; tracked IFVs are usually more heavily armored and possess greater carrying capacity.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> Wheeled IFVs are cheaper and simpler to produce, maintain, and operate.<ref name=\"USMC\"/> From a logistical perspective, they are also ideal for an army without widespread access to transporters or a developed rail network to deploy its armor.<ref name=Harmse/>\n\n==See also==\n{{div

was first developed and popularized by the [[Israel]]i company [[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]] in 1996. The name ICQ derives from the English phrase \"I Seek You\".<ref name=\"Time Warner2001\" /> Ownership of ICQ passed from Mirabilis to [[AOL]] in 1998, and from AOL to [[Mail.Ru|Mail.Ru Group]] in 2010.\n\nThe ICQ client application and service were initially released in November 1996 and the client was freely available to download. Users could register an account and would be assigned a number, like a phone number, for others to be able to contact them (users could also provide handles). ICQ was among the first stand-alone [[instant messenger]] and the first online instant messenger service  \u2014 while real-time chat was not in itself new to the internet ([[IRC]] being the most common platform at the time), the concept of a fully centralized service with individual user accounts focused on one-on-one conversations set the blueprint for later instant messaging services like [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]], and its influence is seen in modern social media applications. Whilst [[Internet Relay Chat]] programs, like [[Pirch]] and [[mIRC]], dominated the market for many years, their popularity began to fall in the face of mobile computing which had begun to take hold with [[PalmPilot]] and the fledgling [[Windows Embedded Compact|Microsoft Windows Compact Edition]].\n\nAt its peak around 2001, ICQ had more than 100 million accounts registered.<ref name=\"Time Warner2001\">[http://www.timewarner.com/newsroom/press-releases/2001/05/09/icq-celebrates-100-million-registered-users ICQ Surpasses 100 Million Registered Users], Time Warner Press Release - May 09, 2001 (accessed 2015-05-12).</ref> At the time of the Mail.Ru acquisition in 2010, there were around 42 million daily users.<ref name=\"bloomberg2014\">{{citation|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-29/icq-messenger-is-growing-for-the-first-time-in-years|title=ICQ Messenger Is Growing for the First Time in Years|first=Ilya|last=Khrennikov|date=29 July 2014|work=Bloomberg Business}}</ref> Since 2013, ICQ has 11 million monthly users.<ref name=\"ICQusers\">{{citation|url=https://corp.mail.ru/en/company/messagers/|title=ICQ 11 million users in the world per month|date=8 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Features==\n*ICQ features include [[offline]] user messaging, multi-user chats, free daily-limited [[Text messaging|SMS]] sending, resumable [[file transfer]]s, greeting cards, [[multiplayer game]]s and a searchable user directory. Users can use [[emoticons]] while chatting with other users.\n*ICQ6 was launched on April 17, 2007, and offered a single communication platform that combines the various user options: [[instant messaging]] services, free [[Text messaging|SMS]] from ICQ to [[Mobile phone|mobile]], voice and [[video]] communication. The software's sounds were created by the Israeli psychedelic trance duo [[Infected Mushroom]]. Among the new additional features in ICQ6 are Quick IM, which allows users to send a short message without opening a conversation window, a \"follow me\" service directly to the user\u2019s mobile, a multi-chat service and support for [[Zlango]], the [[animation|animated]] [[icons]] language.\n\n===Additional products===\nICQ provides all users additional services and content products:\n#ICQ TV\u2014An online video magazine. The magazine broadcasts content for teens 24/7.\n#ICQ [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] Card (together with [[United Mobile]])\u2014A SIM card that enables users traveling across [[Europe]] to use their [[cellular telephone]]s while paying a discount price.\n#ICQ Game Center\u2014A games platform that enables the user to play with and/or against other users. Available by clicking a button in the contact list.\n#ICQ2Go\u2014A web [[instant messaging]] option for users who cannot download the program onto their computers or use it on the networks they are accessing (for various reasons, like security restrictions or [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]).\n#ICQ for Mac<ref>[http://www.icq.com/download/mac/en ICQ for Mac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207140358/http://www.icq.com/download/mac/en |date=2011-02-07 }}</ref> (Beta)\u2014Released in February 2010, a version of the client that was developed using the [[Adobe Integrated Runtime|Adobe AIR platform]], making it usable on additional operating systems which support the AIR runtime, such as [[Linux]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\nAlso, users can choose and select their own avatars for their profile pages. In this way, they can protect their privacy.\n\n==UIN==\nICQ users are identified and distinguished from one another by UIN, or User Identification Numbers, distributed in sequential order. The UIN was invented by [[Mirabilis (company)|Mirabilis]], as the user name assigned to each user upon registration. Issued UINs started at '10,000' (5 digits) and every user receives a UIN when first registering with ICQ. As of ICQ6 users are also able to log in using the specific [[e-mail]] address they associated with their UIN during the initial registration process.\nUnlike other instant messaging software or [[web application]]s, on ICQ the only permanent user info is the UIN, although it is possible to search for other users using their associated e-mail address or any other detail they have made public by updating it in their account's public profile. In addition the user can change all of his or her personal information, including [[User (computing)|screen name]] and e-mail address, without having to re-register. Since 2000 ICQ and [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]] users are able to add each other to their contact list without the need for any external clients. As a response to UIN theft or sale of attractive UINs, ICQ started to store email addresses previously associated with a UIN.<ref>[http://www.icq.com/register/email_attach.php icq.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209025659/http://www.icq.com/register/email_attach.php |date=2006-02-09 }}{{Failed verification|date=November 2015}}</ref> As such UINs that are stolen can sometimes be reclaimed. This applies only if (since 1999 onwards) a valid primary email address was entered into the user profile.\n\n==History==\nThe founding company of ICQ, Mirabilis, was established in June 1996 by five Israelis:  [[Yair Goldfinger]], [[Sefi Vigiser]], [[Amnon Amir]], [[Arik Vardi]], and Arik's father [[Yossi Vardi]].<ref>[http://www.israel21c.org/an-artist-for-the-high-tech-age/ An artist for the high-tech age]</ref> They recognized that many people were accessing the internet through non-[[UNIX]] [[operating system]]s, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], and those users were unfamiliar with established chat technologies, e.g. [[IRC]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nThe technology Mirabilis developed for ICQ was distributed free of charge. The technology's success encouraged [[AOL]] to acquire Mirabilis on June 8, 1998, for $287 million up front and $120 million in additional payments over three years based on performance levels.<ref name=\"nyt mirabilis\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/09/business/america-online-to-buy-internet-chat-service-for-287-million.html |newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=June 9, 1998 |title=America Online to Buy Internet Chat Service for $287 Million }}</ref> At the time this was the highest price ever paid to purchase an Israeli technology company.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 2002 AOL successfully patented the technology.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/2591723.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; Technology &#124; AOL wins instant messaging case |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-03-31 | date=December 19, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite patent |country=US |number=6449344 |title=Communication system |status=patent |assign1=Aol Acquisition Corporation |invent1=Goldfinger, Yair |invent2=Vigiser, Sefi |invent3=Vardi, Arieh |invent4=Amnon, Amir |pubdate= |gdate=2002-09-10 |fdate=1997-01-27 |pridate=1996-10-06}}</ref>\n\nAfter the purchase the product was initially managed by Ariel Yarnitsky and Avi Shechter.

This provided synchronization between multiple computers and enforced obtaining consent before adding UINs to the contact list by preventing clients from modifying the local contact list directly.\n*On December 19, 2002, [[AOL Time Warner]] announced that ICQ had been issued a United States [[patent]] for instant messaging.\n*'''ICQ 2002''' was the last completely advertising-free ICQ version.\n*'''ICQ Pro 2003b''' was the first ICQ version to use the ICQ protocol version 10. However, ''ICQ 5'' and 5.1 use version 9 of the protocol. ''ICQ 2002'' and ''2003a'' used version 8 of the ICQ protocol. Earlier versions (''ICQ 2001b'' and all ICQ clients before it) used ICQ protocol version 7.\n*'''ICQ 4''' and later '''ICQ 5''' (released on Monday, February 7, 2005), were upgrades on ICQ Lite. One addition was Xtraz, which offers games and features intended to appeal to younger users of the Internet. ICQ Lite was originally an idea to offer the lighter users of instant messaging an alternative client which was a smaller download and less resource-hungry for relatively slow computers.\n*'''ICQ 5''' introduced [[Skin (computing)|skins]] support. There are few official [[Skin (computing)|skins]] available for the current ICQ 5.1 at the official website; however, a number of user-generated skins have been made available for download.\n*'''ICQ 6''', released on April 17, 2007, was the first major update since ICQ 4. The [[user interface]] has been redesigned using [[Boxely]], the same rendering engine used in [[AIM Triton]]. This change adds new features such as the ability to send IMs directly from the client's contact list. ICQ has recently started forcing users of v5.1 to upgrade to version 6 (and XP).  Those who do not upgrade will find their older version of ICQ does not start up.  Although the upgrade to version 6 should be seen as a positive thing, some users may find that useful features such as sending multiple files at one time is no longer supported in the new version.  At the beginning of July 2008, a network upgrade forced users to stop using ICQ 5.1 - applications that identified themselves as ICQ 5, such as [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]], were forced to identify themselves as ICQ 6. There seems to be no alternative for users other than using a different IM program or patching ICQ 5.1 with a special application.\n*'''ICQ 7.0''', released on January 18, 2010. This update includes integration with [[Facebook]] and other websites. It also allows custom personal status similar to [[Windows Live Messenger]] ([[MSN Messenger]]). ICQ 7.0 does not support [[traditional Chinese]] on standard installation or with the addition of an official language pack. This has made its adoption difficult with the established user base from Hong Kong and Taiwan where traditional Chinese is the official language.\n*'''ICQ 8''', released on February 5, 2012 - \"Meet the new generation of ICQ, Enjoy free video calls, messages and SMS, social networks support and more.\"\n*'''ICQ 10.0 10242''', released January 18, 2016 - Newest update.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filehorse.com/download-icq/old-versions/|accessdate=January 19, 2016|work=File Horse|title=ICQ}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Privacy and copyright===\nWhen accepting \"ICQ Privacy Policy\" (2011), a user gives all the [[copyright]] in the posted information to ICQ Inc.<ref name=\"icq_privacy_policy\">[https://privacy.icq.com/legal/privacypolicy/en \"ICQ Privacy Policy \u2014 Acceptable Use Policy\"]</ref> This implies that ICQ Inc. may publish, distribute etc. any messages sent through the system despite any privacy intentions of the user:\n\n<blockquote>Please be aware that any information you may have published in a public area (Public Area) may be accessible to ICQ or third parties and used by ICQ or such third parties.

This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]\n'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.\n\nThe Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to [[word coinage|coin]] the term in a [[satire|satirical]] review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.\n\nThe development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s atmospheric work was influential on the birth of Impressionism, here ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' (1839)]]\n\nRadicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.<ref>Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].</ref> The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short \"broken\" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour\u2014not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary\u2014to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.\n\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', 1876, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.<ref>[https://books.google.fr/books?id=AXdOAAAAYAAJ Ingo F. Walther, ''Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day, Part 1''], Centralibros Hispania Edicion y Distribucion, S.A., 1999, {{ISBN|3822870315}}</ref>]]\n\nImpressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the [[Macchiaioli]], and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States, were also exploring ''plein-air'' painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.\n\nThe public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.  By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].\n\n==Beginnings==\nIn the middle of the 19th century\u2014a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] rebuilt Paris and waged war\u2014the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Acad\u00e9mie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Acad\u00e9mie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.<ref>Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14</ref> Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.<ref name=\"The Met\">[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. \"Impressionism: Art and Modernity\". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004)]</ref>\n\nThe Acad\u00e9mie had an annual, juried art show, the [[Salon de Paris]], and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Acad\u00e9mie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-L\u00e9on G\u00e9r\u00f4me]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].\n\nIn the early 1860s, four young painters\u2014[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille]]\u2014met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air, but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 21\u201327.</ref> By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the [[realism (arts)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]]. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Caf\u00e9 Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[\u00c9douard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].<ref>Greenspan, Taube G. \"Armand Guillaumin\", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\n[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[\u00c9douard Manet]], ''[[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]\nDuring the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.<ref>Seiberling, Grace, \"Impressionism\", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.</ref> In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.133.</ref> The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.\n\nAfter Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refus\u00e9s]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refus\u00e9s drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.194.</ref>\n[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''View of the Saint-Martin Canal, Paris'', 1870, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]]]]\nArtists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refus\u00e9s in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Paul C\u00e9zanne|C\u00e9zanne]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Edgar Degas]] and several other artists founded the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme Coop\u00e9rative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' (\"Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers\") to exhibit their artworks independently.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, p. 209.</ref> Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon.<ref>Jensen 1994, p. 90.</ref> The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt ''plein air'' painting years before.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.32.</ref> Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, [[Johan Jongkind]], declined to participate, as did [[\u00c9douard Manet]]. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]].\n\n[[File:Claude Monet - Graystaks I.JPG|thumb|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks, (sunset)]]'', 1890\u20131891, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]\nThe critical response was mixed. Monet and C\u00e9zanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.\n\nHe wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,\n:''Impression\u2014I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.''<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 323.</ref>\n[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'' (Camille and Jean Monet), 1875, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\nThe term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together\u2014albeit with shifting membership\u2014eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.<ref name=\"The Met\" />\n\nMonet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the \"purest\" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.<ref>Gordon; Forge (1988), pp. 11\u201312.</ref> Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. \u00c9douard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,<ref>Distel et al. (1974), p. 127.</ref> never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that \"the Salon is the real field of battle\" where a reputation could be made.<ref>Richardson (1976), p. 3.</ref>\n\n[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]\nAmong the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as C\u00e9zanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.<ref>Denvir (1990), p.105.</ref> Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli]], [[Ludovic-Napol\u00e9on Lepic|Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of \"opening doors to first-come daubers\".<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 603.</ref> The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.\n\nThe individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879.<ref>Distel, Anne, Michel Hoog, and Charles S. Moffett. 1974.

By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.<ref>Rewald (1973), p. 475\u2013476.</ref>\n\n==Impressionist techniques==\n[[File:Cassatt Mary At the Theater 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Lydia Leaning on Her Arms'' (in a theatre box), 1879]]\nFrench painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colourist [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], the leader of the realists [[Gustave Courbet]], and painters of the [[Barbizon school]] such as [[Th\u00e9odore Rousseau]]. The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.\n\nA number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists\u2014and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Turner]]\u2014the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:\n\n* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].\n* Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.\n* Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.\n* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.\n* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.\n* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. \n* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''\u2014the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.\n* In paintings made ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)\n\nNew technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.<ref>Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39\u201341.</ref> Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.<ref>[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105173433/http://phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}.

They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention.

Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography \"produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably\".<ref name = \"impressionism757\"/>\n\nIn spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused \"on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph\u2014by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated\".<ref name = \"impressionism757\"/> The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their \"tacit imperatives of taste and conscience\".<ref name=\"impressionism758\">Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London</ref> Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: \"The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph\".<ref name=\"impressionism757\">Levinson, Paul (1997) ''The Soft Edge; a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York</ref>\n[[File:Claude Monet - Jardin \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse.jpg|thumb|right|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Garden at Sainte-Adresse|Jardin \u00e0 Sainte-Adresse]],'' 1867, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.,<ref>[http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/437133?rpp=20&pg=1&ao=on&ft=Claude+Monet&pos=1 Metropolitan Museum of Art]</ref> a work showing the influence of Japanese prints]]\nAnother major influence was Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] art prints ([[Japonism]]).

[[Eva Gonzal\u00e8s]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.\n\nBy the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean B\u00e9raud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.<ref>Rewald (1973), p.476\u2013477.</ref> Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.\n\nThe influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.\n\n==Beyond France==\n[[File:Serov devochka s persikami.jpg|thumb|''[[Girl with Peaches|The Girl with Peaches]]'' (1887, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) by [[Valentin Serov]]]]\n[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Streeton]]'s 1889 landscape ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], is an example of [[Heidelberg School|Australian impressionism]].]]\n[[File:Hipp hipp hurra!

Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. {{ISBN|9781133954798}}.</ref>\n\n[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.\n\n[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919\u20131929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L\u2019Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.\n\n==Music and literature==\n{{Main|Impressionist music|Impressionism (literature)}}\n[[File:Monet Water Lilies 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Water Lilies]],'' 1916, [[The National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo]]\nMusical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.\n\nThe influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), and [[Manuel De Falla]], and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain).\n\nThe term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9|Mallarm\u00e9]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.\n\n[[File:Camille Pissarro 019.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Children on a Farm'', 1887]]\n\n==Post-Impressionism==\n{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}\nPost-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\" perrow=\"4\">\nFile:A Sunday on La Grande Jatte, Georges Seurat, 1884.png|[[Georges Seurat]], ''[[A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte]]'', 1884\u20131886, [[The Art Institute of Chicago]]\nFile:Vincent Van Gogh 0016.jpg|[[Vincent van Gogh]], ''Cypresses'', 1889, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Paul Gauguin 044.jpg|[[Paul Gauguin]], ''The Midday Nap'', 1894, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]\nFile:Card Players-Paul Cezanne.jpg|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''[[The Card Players]]'', 1894\u20131895, [[Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay]], Paris\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Art periods]]\n* [[Expressionism]] (as a reaction to Impressionism)\n* [[Les XX]]\n* [[Luminism (Impressionism)]]\n* [[Macchiaioli]]\n* [[Cantonese school of painting]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Baumann, Felix Andreas, Marianne Karabelnik-Matta, Jean Sutherland Boggs, and Tobia Bezzola (1994).

An example of Internet slang is \"<code>[[:wikt:LOL#English|LOL]]</code>\" meaning \"laugh out loud\". It is difficult to provide a standardized definition of Internet slang due to the constant changes made to its nature.<ref name=Yin>Yin Yan (2006) World Wide Web and the Formation of the Chinese and English \"Internet Slang Union\". Computer-Assisted Foreign Language Education. Vol. 1. {{ISSN|1001-5795}}</ref> However, it can be understood to be any type of [[slang]] that [[Internet]] users have popularized, and in many cases, have coined. Such terms often originate with the purpose of saving [[keystroke]]s or to compensate for small character limits. Many people use the same [[abbreviation]]s in [[text messaging|texting]] and [[instant messaging]], and [[social networking websites]]. [[Acronym]]s, [[Computer keyboard|keyboard symbols]] and [[abbreviation]]s are common types of Internet slang. New dialects of slang, such as [[leet]] or [[Lolcat|Lolspeak]], develop as [[ingroup]] [[internet meme]]s rather than time savers. Some people only use LOL for fun. Many people use this [[internet slang]] not only on the Internet but also face-to-face.\n\n==Creation and evolution==\n\n===Origins===\nInternet slang originated in the early days of the Internet with some terms predating the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|last=Daw |first=David |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/248526/web_jargon_origins_revealed.html |title=Web Jargon Origins Revealed |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref> Internet slang is used in [[chat room]]s, [[social networking service]]s, [[online game]]s, [[video game]]s and in the [[online community]]. Since 1979, users of communications networks like [[Usenet]] created their own [[shorthand]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Meggyn |url=http://theunderenlightened.com/trolling-for-slang-the-origins-of-internet-werdz/ |title=Trolling For Slang: The Origins of Internet Werdz |publisher=Theunderenlightened.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18}}</ref>\n\n==In pop culture==\nIn Japanese, the term [[moe (slang)|moe]] has come into common use among slang users to mean something extremely cute and appealing.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nAside from the more frequent abbreviations, acronyms, and [[emoticon]]s, Internet slang also uses archaic words or the lesser-known meanings of mainstream terms.<ref name= Yin /> Regular words can also be altered into something with a similar pronunciation but altogether different meaning, or attributed new meanings altogether.<ref name= Yin /> Phonetic transcriptions of foreign words, such as the transformation of \"impossible\" into \"<code>impossibru</code>\" in Japanese and then [the [[transliteration]] of that] back to [the character set used for] English, also occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In places where [[logograph]]ic languages are used, such as China, a visual Internet slang exists, giving characters dual meanings, one direct and one implied.<ref name= Yin />\n\n===Motivations===\nThe primary motivation for using a slang unique to the Internet is to ease [[communication]]. However, while Internet slang shortcuts save time for the writer, they take two times as long for the reader to understand, according to a study by the [[University of Tasmania]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Don't be 404, know the tech slang|date=December 10, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7775013.stm|work=[[BBC]]}}</ref> On the other hand, similar to the use of slang in traditional face-to-face speech or written language, slang on the Internet is often a way of indicating [[social group|group membership]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=1997|title= The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language|edition= Second |location=Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}</ref>\n\nInternet slang provides a channel which facilitates and constrains our ability to communicate in ways that are fundamentally different from those found in other semiotic situations. Many of the expectations and practices which we associate with spoken and written language are no longer applicable. The Internet itself is ideal for new slang to emerge because of the richness of the medium and the availability of information.<ref name=bas /> Slang is also thus motivated for the \u201ccreation and sustenance of online communities\u201d.<ref name=bas /> These communities, in turn, play a role in solidarity or identification<ref name=Yin /><ref name= miao /> or an exclusive or common cause.<ref name=mud />\n\nDavid Crystal distinguishes among five areas of the Internet where slang is used- [[World Wide Web|The Web itself]], [[email]], [[asynchronous communication|asynchronous chat]] (for example, [[mailing list]]s), [[synchronous communication|synchronous chat]] (for example, [[Internet Relay Chat]]), and [[virtual world]]s.<ref name=Davidcrystal>{{cite book|author=Crystal, David |date=2001|title= Language and the Internet|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn= 0-521-80212-1}}</ref> The [[computer|electronic]] character of the channel has a fundamental influence on the language of the medium. Options for communication are constrained by the nature of the hardware needed in order to gain Internet access. Thus, productive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be sent) is determined by the preassigned characters on a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]], and receptive linguistic capacity (the type of information that can be seen) is determined by the size and configuration of the screen. Additionally, both sender and receiver are constrained linguistically by the properties of the internet [[software]], [[computer hardware]], and [[networking hardware]] linking them. Electronic discourse refers to writing that is \"very often reads as if it were being spoken \u2013 that is, as if the sender were writing talking\".<ref>{{cite book|authors=Davis, B.H. & Brewer, J. P. |date=1997 |title=Electronic discourse: linguistic individuals in virtual space|location= Albany, NY|publisher= State University of New York Press}}</ref>\n\n==Types of slang==\n\nInternet slang does not constitute a homogeneous language variety. Rather, it differs according to the user and type of Internet situation.<ref name=hohenhaus>Hohenhaus, Peter (2005). Elements of traditional and \"reverse\" purism in relation to computer-mediated communication. In Langer, Nils and Winifred V. Davies (eds.), Linguistic Purism in the Germanic Languages. Berlin/New York: de Gruyter, 203-220.</ref> However, within the language of Internet slang, there is still an element of [[linguistic prescriptivism|prescriptivism]], as seen in [[style guides]], for example ''Wired Style'',<ref name=hale>[Hale, C. and Scanlon, J (1999). Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age. New York: Broadway Books]</ref> which are specifically aimed at usage on the Internet. Even so, few users consciously heed these prescriptive recommendations on CMC, but rather adapt their styles based on what they encounter online.<ref>Baron, Naomi. (2000). ''Alphabet to Email.'' London: Routledge.</ref> Although it is difficult to produce a clear definition of Internet slang, the following types of slang may be observed. This list is not exhaustive.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Class !! Description\n|-\n| Letter homophones || Included within this group are [[abbreviation]]s and [[acronym]]s. An abbreviation is a shortening of a word, for example \"<code>CU</code>\" or \"<code>CYA</code>\" for \"see you (see ya)\". An acronym, on the other hand, is a subset of abbreviations and are formed from the initial components of a word. Examples of common acronyms include \"<code>LOL</code>\" for \"laugh out loud\", \"<code>BTW</code>\" for \"by the way\" and \"<code>TFW</code>\" for \"that feeling when\". There are also combinations of both, like \"<code>CUL8R</code>\" for \"see you later\".\n|-\n| Punctuation, capitalizations, and other symbols || Such features are commonly used for emphasis. Periods or exclamation marks may be used repeatedly for emphasis, such as \"<code>........</code>\" or \"<code>!!!!!!!!!!</code>\". Question marks and exclamation marks are often used together in strings such as \"<code>?!?!?!?!</code>\" when one is angry while asking a question. Grammatical punctuation rules are also relaxed on the Internet. \"E-mail\" may simply be expressed as \"<code>email</code>\", and apostrophes can be dropped so that \"John's book\" becomes \"<code>johns book</code>\". Examples of capitalizations include \"<code>STOP IT</code>\", which can convey a stronger emotion of annoyance as opposed to \"stop it\". Bold, underline and italics are also used to indicate stress.\n|-\n| Onomatopoeic and/or stylized spellings || [[Onomatopoeia|Onomatopoeic]] spellings have also become popularized on the Internet. One well-known example is \"<code>hahaha</code>\" to indicate laughter. Onomatopoeic spellings are very language specific. For instance, in Spanish, laughter is spelled as \"<code>jajaja</code>\" instead because J is pronounced like H in Spanish. In Thai it's 55555 because 5 in Thai is said Ha. In Korean, it is \"<code>kekeke</code>\".\n|-\n| Keyboard-generated emoticons and smileys || [[Emoticon]]s are generally found in web forums, instant messengers, and online games. They are culture-specific and certain emoticons are only found in some languages but not in others. For example, the Japanese equivalent of emoticons, kaomoji (literally \"face marks\"), focus on the eyes instead of the mouth as in Western emoticons. They are also meant to be read right-side up, as in <code>^_^</code> as opposed to sideways, <code>:3</code>. More recently than face emoticons, other emoticon symbols such as <code><3</code> (which is a sideways heart) have emerged. Compared to emoticons used in Western cultures such as the [[United States]], kaomoji play a very distinct social role in online discourse.<ref>Katsuno, Hirofumi and Christine R. Yano (2002), ''[[Asian Studies Review]]'' 26(2): 205-231</ref>\n|-\n| Direct requests || These are found in chat engines such as [[Internet Relay Chat]] or online games, where personal identities may be concealed. As such, questions such as \"<code>A/S/L?</code>\" which stands for \"age, sex, location?\" are commonly posed.<ref name=Thurlow>Thurlow, C. (2001), Language and the Internet, In R, Mesthrie & R, Asher (Eds), The concise encyclopedia of sociolinguistics, London: Pergamon</ref>\n|-\n| Leet || [[Leet]]speak, or <code>1337</code>,<ref>{{cite web|title=1337 - what is it and how to be 1337|url=http://www.1337.net/|accessdate=30 April 2012}}</ref> is an alternative alphabet for the English language which uses various combinations of ASCII characters to replace Latinate letters. For example, Wikipedia may be expressed as \"<code>\\/\\/1|<1p3[)14</code>\". It originated from computer hacking, but its use has been extended to online gaming as well. Leet is far less common now than in the first decades of the internet.\n|-\n| Novel [[syntax|syntactic]] features || Unusual syntactic structures such as \"[[I Can Has Cheezburger?]]\" and \"You are doing me a frighten\" have been encouraged and spread by highly successful memes. Pluralization of \"the internets\" is another example, which has become common since it was used by [[George W. Bush]] during a televised event.\n|-\n| [[Flaming (Internet)|Flaming]] || Flaming refers to the use of rude or profane language in interactions between Internet users.<ref>Baron, N.S. (2003). Language of the Internet. In A. Farghali (Ed.), The Stanford handbook for language engineers (pp. 59\u2014127). Stanford, California: CSLI</ref> It can be caused by any subject of polarizing nature. For example, there is an ongoing debate among users of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[classic Mac OS]]/[[macOS]] as to which is \"superior\". Historically, the act of flaming has been described as an intrinsic quality of [[email]]s due to an absence of visual and auditory cues in [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC).<ref>Lea, Martin, Tim O\u2019Shea, Pat Fung, and Russel Spears (1992), \u2018Flaming\u2019 in Computer-Mediated Communication.

Selfe (eds). (2002). Global Literacies and the World-Wide Web. London/New York: Routledge</ref> This is illustrated by the widely reported example of a school essay submitted by a Scottish teenager, which contained many abbreviations and acronyms likened to [[SMS language]]. There was great condemnation of this style by the mass media as well as educationists, who expressed that this showed diminishing literacy or linguistic abilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2814235.stm |title=BBC NEWS &#124; UK &#124; Is txt mightier than the word? |publisher=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, [[Linguistic description|descriptivists]] have counter-argued that the Internet allows better expressions of a language.<ref name=www.newjerseynewsroom.com  /> Rather than established linguistic conventions, linguistic choices sometimes reflect personal taste.<ref name=baron>Baron, Naomi S. (2002). Who sets email style: Prescriptivism, coping strategies, and democratizing communication access.

Language and the Internet. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-80212-1}}.</ref> Here, these domains are taken to refer to any domain of interaction where interlocutors need not be geographically proximate to one another, and where the Internet is not primarily used. Internet slang is now prevalent in telephony, mainly through short messages ([[SMS]]) communication. [[Abbreviation]]s and [[interjection]]s, especially, have been popularized in this medium, perhaps due to the limited character space for writing messages on mobile phones. Another possible reason for this spread is the convenience of transferring the existing mappings between expression and meaning into a similar space of interaction.<ref name=new.bbc.co.uk>\"Don't be 404, know the tech slang\". BBC. December 10, 2008.</ref>\n\nAt the same time, Internet slang has also taken a place as part of everyday [[offline]] language, among those with digital access.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The nature and content of [[online]] conversation is brought forward to direct [[offline]] [[communication]] through the [[telephone]] and direct talking, as well as through [[Orthography|written language]], such as in writing notes or letters. In the case of interjections, such as numerically based and abbreviated Internet slang, are not pronounced as they are written physically or replaced by any actual action. Rather, they become [[Lexicalisation|lexicalized]] and spoken like non-slang words in a \u201cstage direction\u201d like fashion, where the actual action is not carried out but substituted with a verbal signal. The notions of flaming and [[troll (Internet)|trolling]] have also extended outside the computer, and are used in the same circumstances of deliberate or unintentional implicatures.<ref name=bas />\n\nThe expansion of Internet slang has been furthered through codification and the promotion of digital literacy. The subsequently existing and growing popularity of such references among those online as well as offline has thus advanced Internet slang [[Digital literacy|literacy]] and globalized it.<ref>Wellman, Barry (2004) The glocal village: Internet and community.

Besides common examples, lesser known slang and slang with a non-English etymology have also found a place in standardized linguistic references. Along with these instances, literature in user-contributed dictionaries such as [[Urban Dictionary]] has also been added to. Codification seems to be qualified through frequency of use, and novel creations are often not accepted by other users of slang.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Brian |url=http://www.noslang.com/rejects/ |title=Rejects |publisher=Noslang.com |accessdate= 28 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Internet slang today===\nAlthough Internet slang began as a means of \"opposition\" to mainstream language, its popularity with today's globalized digitally literate population has shifted it into a part of everyday language, where it also leaves a profound impact.<ref>{{Unbulleted list | {{cite web |last= Eller |first= Lara L. |year= 2005 |work= Thesis |title= Instant Message Communication and its Impact upon Written Language |publisher= [[West Virginia University]] |url=  http://www.wvu.edu/ }}\n{{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= WVU Scholar |url= http://wvuscholar.wvu.edu/ |subscription= yes }}\n | {{cite web |title= Alternate source  |website= University of Hong Kong |url= http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/ER/detail/hkul/3632984 |subscription= yes }} | {{cite web |format= pdf |title= Alternate source |website= Research Gate |url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267419817_Instant_Message_Communication_and_its_Impact_upon_Written_Language }} }}</ref>\n\nFrequently used slang also have become conventionalised into memetic \"unit[s] of cultural information\".<ref name=bas>{{cite web |last=Flamand |first=E |year=2008 |title=The impossible task of dialog analysis in chatboxes |url=http://scholar.googleusercontent.com/scholar?q=cache:D28k7Tswv5wJ:scholar.google.com/+internet+slang+meme&hl=en&as_sdt=0,5}}</ref> These memes in turn are further spread through their use on the Internet, prominently through websites.

This is because Internet slang is prevalent in languages more actively used on the [[Internet]], like [[English language|English]], which is the [[Internet]]\u2019s [[lingua franca]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20332763|title=Learn English online: How the internet is changing language}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/lingua-franca.html|title=English - the universal language on the Internet?|quote=English essentially is the universal language of the Internet}}</ref>\n\n==Around the world==\n[[File:Grass Mud Horse Seal.svg|thumb|Chinese seal carving work.

It is also important to do so because of how other languages are quickly catching up with English on the Internet, following the increase in Internet usage in predominantly non-English speaking countries. In fact, as of May 31, 2011, only approximately 27% of the online population is made up of English speakers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm |title=Internet World Stats |publisher=Internet World Stats |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}</ref>\n\nDifferent cultures tend to have different motivations behind their choice of slang, on top of the difference in language used. For example, in [[Chinese Internet Slang|China]], because of the tough Internet regulations imposed, users tend to use certain slang to talk about issues deemed as sensitive to the government. These include using symbols to separate the characters of a word to avoid detection from manual or automated text pattern scanning and consequential [[censorship]].<ref>Zhou Shuguang (2008). \"Notes On The Net.\" ''Index on Censorship'' Vol 37:2</ref> An outstanding example is the use of the term [[river crab (Internet slang)|<code>river crab</code>]] to denote censorship. River crab (hexie) is pronounced the same as \"harmony\"\u2014the official term used to justify political discipline and censorship. As such Chinese netizens reappropriate the official terms in a sarcastic way.<ref>Nordin, Astrid and Richaud, Lisa (2014), \"Subverting official language and discourse in China?

Significantly, this same style of slang creation is also found in non-alphabetical languages<ref name=Yin /> as, for example, a form of \"<code>e gao</code>\" or alternative political discourse.<ref name=mud>Meng Bingchun (2011) \"From Steamed Bun to Grass Mud Horse: E Gao as alternative political discourse on the Chinese Internet.\" ''Global Media and Communication'' April 2011 vol. 7 no. 1 33\u201351</ref>\n\nThe difference in language often results in miscommunication, as seen in an [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] example, \"<code>555</code>\", which sounds like \"crying\" in Chinese, and \"laughing\" in Thai.<ref name=lovelovechina.com>{{cite web |author=Crystal Tao |date=6 May 2010 |url=http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |title=Why Thai Laugh When Chinese Cry? |publisher=Lovelovechina.com |accessdate=2012-04-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420091421/http://www.lovelovechina.com/entertainment/why-thai-laugh-when-chinese-cry/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df= }}</ref> A similar example is between the English \"<code>haha</code>\" and the Spanish \"<code>jaja</code>\", where both are onomatopoeic expressions of laughter, but the difference in language also meant a different consonant for the same sound to be produced. For more examples of how other languages express \"laughing out loud\", see also: [[LOL]]\n\nIn terms of culture, in Chinese, the numerically based onomatopoeia \"<code>770880</code>\" ({{Zh|c = |s = \u4eb2\u4eb2\u4f60\u62b1\u62b1\u4f60|t = \u89aa\u89aa\u4f60\u62b1\u62b1\u4f60|p = q\u012bn q\u012bn n\u01d0 b\u00e0o b\u00e0o n\u01d0}}), which means to 'kiss and hug you', is used.<ref name=lovelovechina.com /> This is comparable to \"<code>XOXO</code>\", which many Internet users use. In French, \"<code>pkoi</code>\" is used in the place of pourquoi, which means 'why'. This is an example of a combination of onomatopoeia and shortening of the original word for convenience when writing online.\n\nIn conclusion, every different country has their own language background and cultural differences and hence, they tend to have their own rules and motivations for their own Internet slang. However, at present, there is still a lack of studies done by researchers on some differences between the countries.\n\nOn the whole, the popular use of Internet slang has resulted in a unique online and offline community as well as a couple sub-categories of \"special internet slang which is different from other slang spread on the whole internet\u2026 similar to jargon \u2026 usually decided by the sharing community\".<ref name=miao>Wei Miao Miao (2010) \"Internet slang used by online Japanese anime fans.\" ''3PM Journal of Digital Researching and Publishing''.

Its highest development took place under Shaka, initiator of several important organizational, weapons and tactical innovations.<ref>Donald Morris, 'The Washing of the Spears,' Touchstone, 1965.</ref>]]\n'''Impi''' is a [[Zulu language|Zulu]] word for any armed body of men. However, in English it is often used to refer to a Zulu regiment, which is called an ''ibutho'' in Zulu. Its beginnings lie far back in historic tribal warfare customs, when groups of armed men called ''impis'' battled. They were systematised radically by the Zulu king [[Shaka]], who was then only the exiled illegitimate son of king [[Senzangakhona]], but already showing much prowess as a general in the army of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] king [[Dingiswayo]] in the Mthethwa-[[Ndwandwe]] war in the early 1810s.\n\n==Genesis of the impi==\n\nThe Zulu impi is popularly identified with the ascent of [[Shaka Zulu|Shaka]], ruler of the relatively small Zulu tribe before its explosion across the landscape of southern Africa, but its earliest shape as a purposeful instrument of statecraft lies in the innovations of the [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]] chieftain [[Dingiswayo]], according to some historians (Morris 1965).<ref>Donald Morris, The Washing of the Spears. p. 32-67</ref> These innovations in turn drew upon existing tribal customs, such as the ''iNtanga''. This was an age grade tradition common among many of the Bantu peoples of the continent's southern region. Youths were organised into age groups, with each cohort responsible for certain duties and tribal ceremonies. Periodically, the older age grades were summoned to the kraals of sub-chieftains, or ''inDunas'', for consultations, assignments, and an induction ceremony that marked their transition from boys to full-fledged adults and warriors, the ''ukuButbwa''. Kraal or settlement elders generally handled local disputes and issues. Above them were the inDunas, and above the inDunas stood the chief of a particular clan lineage or tribe. The inDunas handled administrative matters for their chiefs \u2013 ranging from settlement of disputes, to the collection of taxes. In time of war, the inDunas supervised the fighting men in their areas, forming leadership of the military forces deployed for combat. The age grade ''iNtangas'', under the guidance of the inDunas, formed the basis for the systematic regimental organisation that would become known worldwide as the impi.<ref name=\"Morris, 32-67\">Morris, 32\u201367</ref>\n\n===Limited nature of early tribal warfare===\nMilitarily warfare was mild among the Bantu prior to the rise of Shaka, though it occurred frequently. Objectives were typically limited to such matters as [[cattle raiding]], avenging some personal insult, or resolving disputes over segments of grazing land. Generally a loose mob, called an ''impi'' participated in these [[melee]]s. There were no campaigns of extermination against the defeated. They simply moved on to other open spaces on the [[veld]]t, and equilibrium was restored. The bow and arrow were known but seldom used. Warfare, like the hunt, depended on skilled spearmen and trackers. The primary weapon was a thin 6-foot throwing spear, the ''[[assegai]]''. Several were carried into combat. Defensive weapons included a small cowhide shield, which was later improved by King Shaka. Many battles were prearranged, with the clan warriors meeting at an assigned place and time, while women and children of the clan watched the festivities from some distance away. Ritualized taunts, single combats and tentative charges were the typical pattern. If the affair did not dissipate before, one side might find enough courage to mount a sustained attack, driving off their enemies. Casualties were usually light. The defeated clan might pay in lands or cattle and have captives to be ransomed, but extermination and mass casualties were rare. Tactics were rudimentary. Outside the ritual battles, the quick raid was the most frequent combat action, marked by burning kraals, seizure of captives, and the driving off of cattle. Pastoral herders and light agriculturalists, the Bantu did not usually build permanent fortifications to fend off enemies. A clan under threat simply packed their meager material possessions, rounded up their cattle and fled until the [[Looting|marauders]] were gone. If the marauders did not stay to permanently dispossess them of grazing areas, the fleeing clan might return to rebuild in a day or two. The genesis of the Zulu impi thus lies in tribal structures existing long before the coming of Europeans or the Shaka era.<ref name=\"Morris, 32-67\"/>\n\n===Rise of Dingiswayo===\n\nIn the early 19th century, a combination of factors began to change the customary pattern. These included rising populations, the growth of white settlement and slaving that dispossessed native peoples both at the Cape and in Portuguese Mozambique, and the rise of ambitious \"new men.\" One such man, a warrior called Dingiswayo (''the Troubled One'') of the Mthethwa rose to prominence. Historians such as Donald Morris hold that his political genius laid the basis for a relatively light hegemony. This was established through a combination of diplomacy and conquest, using not extermination or slavery, but strategic reconciliation and judicious force of arms. This hegemony reduced the frequent feuding and fighting among the small clans in the Mthethwa's orbit, transferring their energies to more centralised forces. Under Dingiswayo the age grades came to be regarded as military drafts, deployed more frequently to maintain the new order. It was from these small clans, including among them the [[eLangeni]] and the Zulu, that Shaka sprung.<ref name=\"Morris, 32-67\"/>\n\n==Ascent and innovations of Shaka==\nShaka proved himself to be one of Dingiswayo's most able warriors after the military call up of his age grade to serve in the Mthethwa forces. He fought with his iziCwe regiment wherever he was assigned during this early period, but from the beginning, Shaka's approach to battle did not fit the traditional mould. He began to implement his own individual methods and style, designing the famous short stabbing spear the ''iKlwa'', a larger, stronger shield, and discarding the oxhide sandals that he felt slowed him down. These methods proved effective on a small scale, but Shaka himself was restrained by his overlord. His conception of warfare was far more extreme that the reconcilitory methods of Dingiswayo. He sought to bring combat to a swift and bloody decision, as opposed to duels of individual champions, scattered raids, or limited skirmishes where casualties were comparatively light. While his mentor and overlord Dingiswayo lived, Shakan methods were reined in, but the removal of this check gave the Zulu chieftain much broader scope. It was under his rule that a much more rigorous mode of tribal warfare came into being. This newer, brutal focus demanded changes in weapons, organisation and tactics.<ref name=\"Morris, 32-67\"/>\n\n===Weapons and shields===\n[[File:Zulu warrior.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Zulu warrior armed with the ''iklwa'' stabbing spear (assegai) and ''iwisa'' club (knobkerrie). His kilt is of [[Genet (animal)|genet]] tails]]\n[[File:The National Archives UK - CO 1069-224-49.jpg|\"Ready for War\"; \"A Zulu\"; \"Zulu Policemen\" - the man pictured to the right wears the head-ring (isicoco) denoting his married status|thumb]]\nShaka is credited with introducing a new variant of the traditional weapon, demoting the long, spindly throwing spear in favour of a heavy-bladed, short-shafted stabbing spear. He is also said to have introduced a larger, heavier cowhide shield (''isihlangu''), and trained his forces to thus close with the enemy in more effective hand-to-hand combat. The throwing spear was not discarded, but standardised like the stabbing implement and carried as a missile weapon, typically discharged at the foe, before close contact. These weapons changes integrated with and facilitated an aggressive mobility and tactical organisation.<ref name=\"Morris, 32-67\"/>\n\nAs weapons, the Zulu warrior carried the ''[[iklwa]]'' stabbing spear (losing one could result in execution) and a [[Club (weapon)|club]] or cudgel fashioned from dense hardwood known in Zulu as the ''iwisa'', usually called the [[knobkerrie]] in English, for beating an enemy in the manner of a [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]]. Zulu officers often carried the Zulu Axe, but this weapon was more of a symbol to show their rank. The iklwa \u2013 so named because of the sucking sound it made when withdrawn from a human body \u2013 with its long (c. 25&nbsp;cm [9.4 in]) and broad blade was an invention of Shaka that superseded the older thrown [[assegai|''ipapa'']] (so named because of the \"pa-pa\" sound it made as it flew through the air). It could theoretically be used both in melee and as a thrown weapon, but warriors were forbidden in Shaka's day from throwing it, which would disarm them and give their opponents something to throw back. Moreover, Shaka felt it discouraged warriors from closing into hand-to-hand combat. Shaka's brother, and successor, [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]] reintroduced greater use of the throwing spear, perhaps as a counter to Boer firearms.\n\nAs early as Shaka's reign small numbers of firearms, often obsolete muskets and rifles, were obtained by the Zulus from Europeans by trade. In the aftermath of the defeat of the British at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] many Martini-Henry rifles were captured by the Zulus together with considerable amounts of ammunition. The advantage of this capture is debatable due to the alleged tendency of Zulu warriors to close their eyes when firing such weapons. The possession of firearms did little to change Zulu tactics, which continued to rely on a swift approach to the enemy to bring him into close combat.\n\nAll warriors carried a shield made of oxhide, which retained the hair, with a central stiffening shaft of wood, the ''mgobo''. Shields were the property of the king; they were stored in specialised structures, raised off the ground for protection from vermin, when not issued to the relevant regiment. The large ''isihlangu'' shield of Shaka's day was about five feet in length and was later partially replaced by the smaller ''umbumbuluzo,'' a shield of identical manufacture but around three and a half feet in length. Close combat relied on co-ordinated use of the ''iklwa'' and shield. The warrior sought to get the edge of his shield behind the edge of his enemy's, so that he could pull the enemy's shield to the side thus opening him to a thrust with the ''iklwa'' deep into the abdomen or chest.\n\n===Logistics===\nThe fast-moving host, like all military formations, needed supplies. These were provided by young boys, who were attached to a force and carried rations, cooking pots, sleeping mats, extra weapons and other material. Cattle were sometimes driven on the hoof as a movable larder. Again, such arrangements in the local context were probably nothing unusual. What was different was the systematisation and organisation, a pattern yielding major benefits when the Zulu were dispatched on raiding missions.\n\n===Age-grade regimental system===\nAge-grade groupings of various sorts were common in the Bantu tribal culture of the day, and indeed are still important in much of Africa. [[Age grade]]s were responsible for a variety of activities, from guarding the camp, to cattle herding, to certain rituals and ceremonies. It was customary in Zulu culture for young men to provide limited service to their local chiefs until they were married and recognised as official householders. Shaka manipulated this system, transferring the customary service period from the regional clan leaders to himself, strengthening his personal hegemony. Such groupings on the basis of age, did not constitute a permanent, paid military in the modern Western sense, nevertheless they did provide a stable basis for sustained armed mobilisation, much more so than ad hoc tribal levies or war parties.\n\nShaka organised the various age grades into [[List of Zulu Regiments|regiments]], and quartered them in special military kraals, with each regiment having its own distinctive names and insignia. Some historians argue that the large military establishment was a drain on the Zulu economy and necessitated continual raiding and expansion. This may be true since large numbers of the society's men were isolated from normal occupations, but whatever the resource impact, the regimental system clearly built on existing tribal cultural elements that could be adapted and shaped to fit an expansionist agenda.\n\nAfter their 20th birthdays, young men would be sorted into formal ''ibutho'' (plural ''amabutho'') or regiments. They would build their ''i=handa'' (often referred to as a 'homestead', as it was basically a stockaded group of huts surrounding a corral for cattle), their gathering place when summoned for active service. Active service continued until a man married, a privilege only the king bestowed. The amabutho were recruited on the basis of age rather than regional or tribal origin. The reason for this was to enhance the centralised power of the Zulu king at the expense of clan and tribal leaders. They swore loyalty to the king of the Zulu nation.\n\n===Mobility, training and insignia===\n[[File:Jong Zoeloekryger 1860.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Zulu warrior in full regimental regalia, carrying the large ''isihlangu'' war shield. c. 1860. The upper body is covered in cow tails, the kilt is of spotted cat, genet or civet skin and the shins are decorated with cowtails. The elaborate headdress consists of a browband and face-framing flaps of leopard skin with another band of otter skin above. There are multiple ostrich feather plumes and a single upright crane's feather.]]\nShaka discarded sandals to enable his warriors to run faster. Initially the move was unpopular, but those who objected were simply killed, a practice that quickly concentrated the minds of remaining personnel. Zulu tradition indicates that Shaka hardened the feet of his troops by having them stamp thorny tree and bush branches flat. Shaka drilled his troops frequently, implementing forced marches covering more than fifty miles a day.<ref>Morris, ''Washing of the Spears'', p. 51.</ref> He also drilled the troops to carry out encirclement tactics (see below). Such mobility gave the Zulu a significant impact in their local region and beyond. Upkeep of the regimental system and training seems to have continued after Shaka's death, although Zulu defeats by the Boers, and growing encroachment by British colonists, sharply curtailed raiding operations prior to the War of 1879. Morris (1965, 1982) records one such mission under King Mpande to give green warriors of the uThulwana regiment experience:  a raid into Swaziland, dubbed ''\"Fund' uThulwana\"'' by the Zulu, or \"Teach the uThulwana\".\n\nImpi warriors were trained as early as age six, joining the army as ''udibi'' porters at first, being enrolled into [[age set|same-age groups]] (''intanga''). Until they were ''buta'''d, Zulu boys accompanied their fathers and brothers on campaign as servants. Eventually, they would go to the nearest ''ikhanda'' to ''kleza'' (literally, \"to drink directly from the udder\"), at which time the boys would become ''inkwebane'', cadets. They would spend their time training until they were formally enlisted by the king. They would challenge each other to stick fights, which had to be accepted on pain of dishonor.\n\nIn Shaka's day, warriors often wore elaborate plumes and cow tail regalia in battle, but by the [[Anglo-Zulu War]] of 1879, many warriors wore only a loin cloth and a minimal form of headdress. The later period Zulu soldier went into battle relatively simply dressed, painting his upper body and face with chalk and red ochre, despite the popular conception of elaborately panoplied warriors. Each ''ibutho'' had a singular arrangement of headdress and other adornments, so that the Zulu army could be said to have had regimental uniforms; latterly the 'full-dress' was only worn on festive occasions. The men of senior regiments would wear, in addition to their other headdress, the head-ring (''isicoco'') denoting their married state. A gradation of shield colour was found, junior regiments having largely dark shields the more senior ones having shields with more light colouring; Shaka's personal regiment ''Fasimba'' (The Haze) having white shields with only a small patch of darker colour. This shield uniformity was facilitated by the custom of separating the king's cattle into herds based on their coat colours.\n\nCertain adornments were awarded to individual warriors for conspicuous courage in action; these included a type of heavy brass arm-ring (''ingxotha'') and an intricate necklace composed of interlocking wooden pegs (''iziqu'').\n\n===Tactics===\n{{main article|Pincer movement}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Zulu battle tactics language-neutral.svg|thumb|The buffalo horns formation of the Zulu army. Parts 1\u20134 above: 1 \"enemy\", 2 \"horns\", 3 \"chest\", 4 \"loins\"]]\nThe Zulu typically took the offensive, deploying in the well-known \"buffalo horns\" formation ({{lang-zu|impondo zenkomo}}). It comprised three elements:\n\n#'''the \"horns\", or flanking right and left wing elements,''' to encircle and pin the enemy. Generally the \"horns\" were made up of younger, greener troops.\n#'''the \"chest\" or central main force''' which delivered the coup de grace. The prime fighters made up the composition of the main force.\n#'''the \"loins\" or reserves''' used to exploit success or reinforce elsewhere. Often these were older veterans. Sometimes these were positioned with their backs to the battle so as not to get unduly excited.\n\n[[Encirclement]] tactics are not unique in warfare, and historians note that attempts to surround an enemy were not unknown even in the ritualised battles. The use of separate manoeuvre elements to support a stronger central group is also well known in pre-mechanised tribal warfare, as is the use of reserve echelons farther back. What was unique about the Zulu was the degree of organisation, consistency with which they used these tactics, and the speed at which they executed them. Developments and refinements may have taken place after Shaka's death, as witnessed by the use of larger groupings of regiments by the Zulu [[Anglo-Zulu War|against the British]] in 1879. Missions, available manpower and enemies varied, but whether facing native spear, or European bullet, the impis generally fought in and adhered to the classical buffalo horns pattern.\n\n===Organisation and leadership of the Zulu forces===\n\n'''Regiments and corps. ''' The Zulu forces were generally grouped into three levels: regiments, corps of several regiments, and \"armies\" or bigger formations, although the Zulu did not use these terms in the modern sense. Although size distinctions were taken account of, any grouping of men on a mission could collectively be called an impi, whether a raiding party of 100 or horde of 10,000. Numbers were not uniform but dependent on a variety of factors, including assignments by the king, or the manpower mustered by various clan chiefs or localities. A regiment might be 400 or 4000 men. These were grouped into corps that took their name from the military kraals where they were mustered, or sometimes the dominant regiment of that locality. There were 4 basic ranks: herdboy assistants, warriors, inDunas and higher ranked supremos for a particular mission.\n\n'''Higher command and unit leadership.''' Leadership was not a complicated affair. An [[inDuna]] guided each regiment, and he in turn answered to senior izinduna who controlled the corps grouping. Overall guidance of the host was furnished by elder izinduna usually with many years of experience. One or more of these elder chiefs might accompany a big force on an important mission, but there was no single \"[[field marshal]]\" in supreme command of all Zulu forces. Regimental izinduna, like the [[non-coms]] of today's army, and yesterday's [[Roman Centurion]]s, were extremely important to morale and discipline. This was shown during the battle of Isandhlwana. Blanketed by a hail of British bullets, rockets and artillery, the advance of the Zulu faltered. Echoing from the mountain, however, were the shouted cadences and fiery exhortations of their regimental izinduna, who reminded the warriors that their king did not send them to run away. Thus encouraged, the encircling regiments remained in place, maintaining continual pressure, until weakened British dispositions enabled the host to make a final surge forward. (See Morris ref below\u2014\"The [[Washing of the Spears]]\").\n\n===Summary of the Shakan reforms===\n\nAs noted above, Shaka was neither the originator of the impi, or the age grade structure, nor the concept of a bigger grouping than the small clan system. His major innovations were to blend these traditional elements in a new way, to systematise the approach to battle, and to standardise organization, methods and weapons, particularly in his adoption of the ''ilkwa'' \u2013 the Zulu thrusting spear, unique long-term regimental units, and the \"buffalo horns\" formation. Dingswayo's approach was of a loose federation of allies under his hegemony, combining to fight, each with their own contingents, under their own leaders. Shaka dispensed with this, insisting instead on a standardised organisation and weapons package that swept away and replaced old clan allegiances with loyalty to himself. This uniform approach also encouraged the loyalty and identification of warriors with their own distinctive military regiments. In time, these warriors, from many conquered tribes and clans came to regard themselves as one nation- the Zulu. The [[Marian reforms]] of Rome in the military sphere are referenced by some writers as similar. While other ancient powers such as the Carthaginians maintained a patchwork of force types, and the legions retained such phalanx-style holdovers like the ''triarii,'' Marius implemented one consistent standardised approach for all the infantry. This enabled more disciplined formations and efficient execution of tactics over time against a variety of enemies. As one military historian notes: \n:''Combined with Shaka's \"buffalo horns\" attack formation for surrounding and annihilating enemy forces, the Zulu combination of iklwa and shield\u2014similar to the Roman legionaries' use of gladius and scutum\u2014was devastating. By the time of Shaka's assassination in 1828, it had made the Zulu kingdom the greatest power in southern Africa and a force to be reckoned with, even against Britain's modern army in 1879.''<ref>Guttman, Jon. ''Military History'', Jun2008, Vol. 24 Issue 4, p. 23-23.</ref>\n\n==The Impi in battle==\nThe impi, in its Shakan form, is best known among Western readers from the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879, particularly the famous Zulu victory at Isandhlwana, but its development was over 60 years in coming before that great clash. To understand the full scope of the impi's performance in battle, military historians of the Zulu typically look to its early operations against internal African enemies, not merely the British interlude.<ref>Knight, Ian (1995) ''Anatomy of the Zulu Army'', pp. 3\u201349.</ref> In terms of numbers, the operations of the impi would change- from the Western equivalent of small company and battalion size forces, to manoeuvres in multi-divisional strength of between 10,000 and 40,000 men. The victory won by Zulu king Cetawasyo at Ndondakusuka, for example, two decades before the British invasion involved a deployment of 30,000 troops.<ref>Morris, pp. 195\u2013196</ref> These were sizeable formations in regional context but represented the bulk of prime Zulu fighting strength. Few impi-style formations were to routinely achieve this level of mobilisation for a single battle. For example, at [[Battle of Cannae|Cannae]], the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] deployed 80,000 men, and generally could put tens of thousands more into smaller combat actions<ref>Davis, Paul K. (2001), ''100 Decisive Battles: From Ancient Times to the Present'', pp. 14\u2013126.</ref>). The popular notion of countless attacking black spearmen is a distorted one. Manpower supplies on the continent were often limited. In the words of one historian: \"The savage hordes of popular lore seldom materialized on African battlefields.\"<ref>Bruce Vandervort, ''Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa: 1830\u20131914'', Indiana University Press: 1998, p. 39.</ref> This limited resource base would hurt the Zulu when they confronted technologically advanced world powers such as Britain. The advent of new weapons like firearms would also have a profound impact on the African battlefield, but as will be seen, the impi-style forces  largely eschewed firearms, or used them in a minor way. Whether facing native spear or European bullet, impis largely fought as they had since the days of Shaka, from Zululand to Zimbabwe, and from Mozambique to Tanzania.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">J.D. Omer-Cooper, ''The Zulu Aftermath''.</ref>\n\n===The starting period: Clash at Gqokli Hill===\n{{main|Battle of Gqokli Hill}}\nUpon his accession to power, Shaka was confronted by two potent threats, the [[Ndwandwe]]s under [[Zwide kaLanga|Zwide]], and the [[Qwabe]]s. Both clans were twice as large as the Zulu. The first key test of the \"new model\" Shakan impis would be against the Ndwandwe, and the battle offers insight into both Shaka as a commander and the performance of his reorganised combat team. The Zulu king deployed his troops in a strong position on top of [[Gqokli Hill]], using a deep depression on the summit to hide a large central reserve, while grouping his other warriors forward in defensive formation. Shaka also made a decoy gambit -- sending the Zulu cattle off with a small escort, luring Zwide into splitting his force. The battle began in the early morning as the Ndwandwe, under Zwide's son Nomahlanjana, made a series of frontal attacks up the steep hill. Slowed by the incline, and armed only with traditional throwing spears, they were badly mauled by Shaka's men in close quarters fighting. By mid-afternoon, the Ndwandwe were exhausted and their force weakened further by small groups of men going off in search of water. Shaka however had cunningly positioned himself so that his troops had access to a small stream nearby. In the late afternoon the Ndwandwe made a final attack. Leaving a part of their army surrounding the bottom of the hill, they pushed a huge column up to the top, hoping to drive the Zulu down into the blocking forces below. Shaka waited until the column was almost at the top, then ordered his fresh reserves to make a flanking \"horn\" attack, sprinting down both sides of the hill to encircle and liquidate the ascending Ndwandwe. The rest of the enemy force, which could not clearly see what was happening on the summit was next attacked in another encircling manoeuvre that sent it fleeing. In its first major battle, the Shakan impi had pulled off a multiple envelopment.<ref name=\"Morris pp. 60-69\">Morris, Washing of the Spears, pp. 60\u201369</ref> On the negative side, the Ndwandwe remnants had been able to withdraw intact, and all the Zulu cattle were captured. Shaka furthermore was forced eventually to recall and pull back the warriors to his kraal at [[kwaBulawayo]]. Nevertheless, the impi had badly mauled an enemy force over twice its size, killing 5 of Zwide's sons in the process and succeeding in its first major test. A period of rebuilding now commenced and new recruits, either by conquest or alliance were incorporated into the growing Shakan force. Among the newcomers was one [[Mzilikazi]], a small-time chieftain of the [[Kumalo]], and a grandson of Zwide whose father had been killed by Zwide. Mzilikazi would eventually fall out with Shaka, and in fleeing, would extend the concept of the impi even further across the landscape of southern and eastern Africa.<ref name=\"Morris pp. 60-69\"/>\n\n===The period of consolidation: the Zulu impi and its variants===\nIn this period Shaka's power grew, defeating several powerful local rivals and creating a vast monolith that was the most powerful nation in its region.\n\nShaka's success was to spawn several offshoots of the impi-style formation. Chief among these was the [[Matebele (people)|Matebele]], under [[Mzilkhazi]], and the [[Shangaan]], under the redoubtable [[Soshangane]].<ref>J.D. Omer-Cooper, ''The Zulu aftermath''.</ref> The greatest expansion of the impi outside the Zululand/Zimbabwe area however was to come in East Africa, where bands of [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] fighting men, conquered large swathes of territory, using the methods first laid down by Shaka.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\n=== The first challenge of Europe:  African impi versus the Boer Commando ===\nThe impi clashed with another tactical system introduced by European settlers:  the horse-gun system of the [[Boer Commando]]. This conflict is often popularly conceived of in terms of the well known battles between Zulu King [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]] and the Boers, most notably at the [[Battle of Blood River]]. As will be seen however, this tells only part of the story. The impi was to clash with the mobile commando on the open fields of the high veldt in a series of epic confrontations, in which each force both suffered defeat and enjoyed victory, and both sides acquitted themselves well.<ref>See J. D. Omer-Cooper: ''The Zulu Aftermath'' and Donald Morris: ''The Washing of the Spears''.</ref>\n\n===The second challenge of Europe: African impi versus the British Empire===\n\n[[File:Zuluorderofbattlebig.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Zulu deployment at ''Isandhlwana'' shows the well-organized tactical system of the ''impi''. The left horn worked with the chest to pin the British down, drawing the bulk of their fire. The right horn meanwhile circled around the mountain to attack the English rear. The reserves struck deeper, cutting off and pursuing fugitives, and eventually attacking Rorke's Drift.<ref>''Isandlwana 1879: The Great Zulu Victory'', by Ian Knight, Osprey: 2002, pp. 49, See also Donald Morris, ''The Washing of The Spears'', Touchstone: 1965, pp. 263-382.</ref>]]\n\nNearly 35,000 strong,<ref>Colenso, 1880, p.318, gives the total strength of the Zulu army at 35,000.</ref> well motivated and supremely confident, the Zulu were a formidable force on their own home ground, despite the almost total lack of modern weaponry. Their greatest assets were their morale, unit leadership, mobility and numbers. Tactically the Zulu acquitted themselves well in at least 3 encounters, [[Battle of Isandlwana|Isandhlwana]], [[Battle of Hlobane|Hlobane]] and the smaller [[Battle of Intombe|Intombi]] action. Their stealthy approach march, camouflage and noise discipline at Isandhlwana, while not perfect, put them within excellent striking distance of their opponents, where they were able to exploit weaknesses in the camp layout. At Hlobane they caught a British column on the move rather than in the usual fortified position, partially cutting off its retreat and forcing it to withdraw.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">D. Morris-Washing of the Spears- 1965, pp. 263-382</ref>\n\nStrategically (and perhaps understandably in their own traditional tribal context) they lacked any clear vision of fighting their most challenging war, aside from smashing the three British columns by the weight and speed of their regiments. Despite the Isandhlwana victory, tactically there were major problems as well. They rigidly and predictably applied their three-pronged \"buffalo horns\" attack, paradoxically their greatest strength, but also their greatest weakness when facing concentrated firepower. The Zulu failed to make use of their superior mobility by attacking the British rear area such as Natal or in interdicting vulnerable British supply lines. However, an important consideration, which King [[Cetshwayo]] appreciated, was that there was a clear difference between defending one's territory, and encroaching on another, regardless of the fact that they are at war with the holder of that land. The King realised that peace would be impossible if a real invasion of Natal was launched, and that it would only provoke a more concerted effort on the part of the British against them. The attack on Rorke's Drift, in Natal, was an opportunist raid, as opposed to a real invasion. When they did, they achieved some success, such as the liquidation of a supply detachment at the [[Intombi River]]. A more expansive mobile strategy might have cut British communications and brought their lumbering advance to a halt, bottling up the redcoats in scattered strongpoints while the impis ran rampant between them. Just such a scenario developed with the No. 1 British column, which was penned up static and immobile in garrison for over two months at [[Eshowe]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe Zulu also allowed their opponents too much time to set up fortified strongpoints, assaulting well defended camps and positions with painful losses. A policy of attacking the redcoats while they were strung out on the move, or crossing difficult obstacles like rivers, might have yielded more satisfactory results. For example, four miles past the [[Ineyzane River]], after the British had comfortably crossed, and after they had spent a day consolidating their advance, the Zulu finally launched a typical \"buffalo horn\" encirclement attack that was seen off with withering fire from not only [[Breech-loading weapon|breech-loading]] [[Martini-Henry]] rifles, but 7-pounder artillery and Gatling guns. In fairness, the Zulu commanders could not conjure regiments out of thin air at the optimum time and place. They too needed time to marshal, supply and position their forces, and sort out final assignments to the three-prongs of attack. Still, the Battle of Hlobane Mountain offers just a glimpse of an alternative mobile scenario, where the manoeuvering Zulu \"horns\" cut off and drove back Buller's column when it was dangerously strung out on the mountain.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n====Command and control====\nCommand and control of the impis was problematic at times. Indeed, the Zulu attacks on the British strongpoints at Rorke's Drift and at Kambula, (both bloody defeats) seemed to have been carried out by over-enthusiastic leaders and warriors despite contrary orders of the Zulu King, Cetshwayo. Popular film re-enactments display a grizzled ''izinduna'' directing the host from a promontory with elegant sweeps of the hand. This might have happened during the initial marshaling of forces from a jump off point, or the deployment of reserves, but once the great encircling sweep of frenzied warriors in the \"horns\" and \"chest\" was in motion, the ''izinduna'' could not generally exercise detailed control.\n\n====Handling of reserve forces====\nAlthough the \"loins\" or reserves were on hand to theoretically correct or adjust an unfavorable situation, a shattered attack could make the reserves irrelevant. Against the Boers at [[Battle of Blood River|Blood River]], massed gunfire broke the back of the Zulu assault, and the Boers were later able to mount a cavalry sweep in counterattack that became a turkey shoot against fleeing Zulu remnants. Perhaps the Zulu threw everything forward and had little left.<!---sounds like [[WP:OR]] speculation even if footnoted---> In similar manner, after exhausting themselves against British firepower at [[Battle of Kambula|Kambula]] and [[Battle of Ulundi|Ulindi]], few of the Zulu reserves were available to do anything constructive, although the tribal warriors still remained dangerous at the guerrilla level when scattered. At Isandhlwana however, the \"classical\" Zulu system struck gold, and after liquidating the British position, it was a relatively fresh reserve force that swept down on Rorke's Drift.<ref>I. Knigh. ''Isandlwana'' , 2002, p. 49; D. Morri, ''Washing of the Spears'', 1965, pp. 263-382.</ref>\n\n====Use of modern arms====\n<!---getting bit afield from Zulus here. Need higher level topic to compare other forces ---->\nThe Zulu had greater numbers than their opponents, but greater numbers massed together in compact arrays simply presented easy targets in the age of modern firearms and artillery. African tribes that fought in smaller guerrilla detachments typically held out against European invaders for a much longer time, as witnessed by the 7-year resistance of the [[Lobi people|Lobi]] against the French in West Africa, or the operations of the Berbers in [[Algeria]] against the French.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n\nWhen the Zulu did acquire firearms, most notably captured stocks after the great victory at Isandhlwana, they lacked training and used them ineffectively, consistently firing high to give the bullets \"strength.\" Southern Africa, including the areas near Natal, was teeming with bands like the [[Griqua people|Griquas]] who had learned to use guns. Indeed, one such group not only mastered the way of the gun, but became proficient horsemen as well, skills that helped build the [[Basotho]] tribe, in what is now the nation of [[Lesotho]]. In addition, numerous European renegades or adventurers (both [[Boer]] and non-Boer) skilled in firearms were known to the Zulu. Some had even led detachments for the Zulu kings on military missions.\n\nThe Zulu thus had clear scope and opportunity to master and adapt the new weaponry. They also had already experienced defeat against the Boers, by concentrated firearms. They had had at least four decades to adjust their tactics to this new threat. A well-drilled corps of gunmen or grenadiers, or a battery of artillery operated by European mercenaries for example, might have provided much needed covering fire as the regiments manoeuvred into position.\n\nNo such adjustments were on hand when they faced the redcoats. Immensely proud of their system, and failing to learn from their earlier defeats, they persisted in \"human wave\" attacks against well defended European positions where massed firepower devastated their ranks. The ministrations of an ''isAngoma'' (plural: ''izAngoma'') Zulu diviner or \"witch doctor\", and the bravery of individual regiments were ultimately of little use against the volleys of modern rifles, [[Gatling gun]]s and artillery at the Ineyzane River, Rorke's Drift, Kambula, Gingingdlovu and finally Ulindi.\n\n====A tough challenge====\n<!---both title and tone sound [[WP:POV]] even if referenced. \"Undoubtedly\"?---->\nUndoubtedly, Cetshwayo and his war leaders faced a tough and extremely daunting task \u2013 overcoming the challenge of concentrated rifled, [[Gatling gun]], and artillery fire on the battlefield. It was one that also taxed European military leaders, as the carnage of the American Civil War and the later Boer War attests. Nevertheless, Shaka's successors could argue that within the context of their experience and knowledge, they had done the best they could, following his classical template, which had advanced the Zulu from a small, obscure tribe to a respectable regional power known for its fierce warriors.\n\n==Demise of the Impi==\nThe demise of the impi finally came about with the success of European colonisation of Africa- first in southern Africa by the British, and finally in [[German East Africa]] as German colonialists defeated the last of the impi-style formations under [[Mkwawa]], chief of the [[Hehe people|Hehe]] of Tanzania. The Boers, another major challenger to the impi, also saw defeat by imperial forces, in the [[Boer War]] of 1902. In its relatively brief history, the impi inspired both scorn (During the [[Anglo-Zulu War]], British commander [[Frederick Augustus Thesiger, 2nd Baron Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]] complained that they did not 'fight fair') and admiration in its opponents, epitomised in Kipling's poem \"Fuzzy Wuzzy\":\n\n:''We took our chanst among the Khyber 'ills,''\n::''The Boers knocked us silly at a mile,''\n:''The Burman give us Irriwady Chills,''\n::''<nowiki>'</nowiki>An' a Zulu Impi dished us up in style.''\n\nToday the impi lives on in popular lore and culture, even in the West. While the term \"impi\" has become synonymous with the Zulu nation in international popular culture, it appears in various video games such as ''[[Civilization III]]'', ''[[Civilization IV: Warlords]]'', ''[[Civilization: Revolution]]'', and ''[[Civilization V: Brave New World]]'', where the Impi is the unique unit for the Zulu faction with Shaka as their leader and also as an appearance as unique unit of the Bantu nation in ''[[Rise of Nations]]'' (Zulus are among many tribes who make up the Bantu people) . 'Impi' is also the title of a very famous South Africa song by [[Johnny Clegg]] and the band [[Juluka]] which has become something of an unofficial national anthem, especially at major international sports events and especially when the opponent is England.\n\nLyrics:\n\n:''Impi! O nans'impi iyeza (Impi! Oh here comes impi)''\n:''Uban'obengathint'amabhubesi? (Who would have touched the lions?)''\n\nBefore stage seven of the 2013 [[Tour de France]], the [[Orica-GreenEDGE]] cycling team played 'Impi' on their team bus in honor of teammate [[Daryl Impey]], the first South African [[Tour de France]] leader.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=darylimpey|author=Daryl Impey|number=353076722595405824|date=5 July 2013|title=Love this team - singing to \"Impi\" on the bus , legendary moments}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Cite book|last=Colenso|first=Frances E.|others=Assisted by Edward Durnford|year=1880|title=History of the Zulu War and Its Origin|location=[[London]]|publisher=[[Chapman & Hall]]|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofzuluwar00colerich}}\n* Knight, Ian.

However, much of it was preserved in [[medieval Irish literature]], though it was shorn of its religious meanings. This literature represents the most extensive and best preserved of all the branches of [[Celtic mythology]]. Although many of the manuscripts have not survived and much more material was probably never committed to writing, there is enough remaining to enable the identification of distinct, if overlapping, cycles: the [[Mythological Cycle]], the [[Ulster Cycle]], the [[Fenian Cycle]] and the [[Historical Cycle]]. There are also a number of extant mythological texts that do not fit into any of the cycles. Additionally, there are a large number of recorded [[Folklore|folk tales]] that, while not strictly mythological, feature personages from one or more of these four cycles.\n\nToday some of the best known tales are of [[T\u00edr na n\u00d3g]], [[Fionn mac Cumhaill|Fionn MacCumhaill]], [[Fianna|Na Fianna]], [[Aos S\u00ed|The Aos S\u00ed / Aes S\u00eddhe]], [[C\u00fa Chulainn|S\u00e9tanta (C\u00faChulainn)]], [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann|The Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann (Gods)]], the [[Children of Lir]], [[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]] & [[Salmon of Knowledge|the Salmon of Knowledge]].\n\n== Divinity In Irish Mythology ==\nDepending on the sources, the importance of gods and goddesses in Irish mythology varies. The geographical tales, [[Dindsenchas|Dindshenchas]], emphasize the importance of female divinities while the historical tradition focuses on the colonizers, inventors, or male warriors with the female characters only intervening in episodes. There are multiple categories of goddesses in Irish Mythology: The Mother Goddess, Seasonal Goddess, and Warrior Goddess are a few.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=T.|first=H.

It is the oldest surviving manuscript written entirely in the Irish language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/819379953|title=Education and Celtic myth : national self-image and schoolbooks in 20th century Ireland|last=P\u00e1draic.|first=Frehan,|date=2012|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042035904|oclc=819379953}}</ref> The stories in this manuscript are a part of the Ulster Cycle of Irish Mythology.\n\nOther important sources include a group of four manuscripts originating in the west of Ireland in the late 14th or early 15th century: ''The [[Yellow Book of Lecan]]'', ''The [[Great Book of Lecan]]'', and ''The [[Book of Ballymote]]''. The first is these is housed in Trinity College as well as three others are in the Royal Academy. The Yellow Book of Lecan is composed of sixteen parts and includes the legends of Fionn Mac Cumhail, selections of legends of Irish Saints, and the earliest known version of the ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]'' (\"The Driving-off of Cattle of Cooley\"). This is one of Europe's oldest epics written in a vernacular language.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/819379953|title=Education and Celtic myth : national self-image and schoolbooks in 20th century Ireland|last=P\u00e1draic.|first=Frehan,|date=2012|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042035904|oclc=819379953}}</ref> Other 15th-century manuscripts, such as ''The Book of Fermoy'' also contain interesting materials, as do such later syncretic works such as [[Geoffrey Keating]]'s ''Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn'' (''The History of Ireland'') (ca. 1640), particularly as these later compilers and writers may have had access to manuscript sources that have since disappeared. \n\nWhen using these sources, it is, as always, important to question the impact of the circumstances in which they were produced. Most of the manuscripts were created by Christian [[monk]]s, who may well have been torn between the desire to record their native culture and their religious hostility to pagan beliefs resulting in some of the gods being [[wiktionary:euhemerize|euhemerised]]. Many of the later sources may also have formed part of a propaganda effort designed to create a history for the people of Ireland that could bear comparison with the mythological descent of their British invaders from the founders of Rome that was promulgated by [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and others.  There was also a tendency to rework Irish genealogies to fit into the known schema of Greek or Biblical genealogy.\n\nIt was once unquestioned that medieval Irish literature preserved truly ancient traditions in a form virtually unchanged through centuries of [[oral tradition]] back to the ancient [[Celts]] of Europe. [[Kenneth H. Jackson|Kenneth Jackson]] famously described the Ulster Cycle as a \"window on the Iron Age\", and Garret Olmsted has attempted to draw parallels between ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge]]'', the Ulster Cycle epic, and the iconography of the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]]. However, this \"nativist\" position has been challenged by \"revisionist\" scholars who believe that much of it was created in Christian times in deliberate imitation of the [[Epic poetry|epic]]s of [[classical literature]] that came with [[Latin]] learning. The revisionists would indicate passages apparently influenced by the [[Iliad]] in ''T\u00e1in B\u00f3 Cuailnge'', and the existence of ''Togail Tro\u00ed'', an Irish adaptation of [[Dares Phrygius]]' ''De excidio Troiae historia'', found in the Book of Leinster, and note that the material culture of the stories is generally closer to the time of the stories' composition than to the distant past. A consensus has emerged which encourages the critical reading of the material.\n\n==Mythological cycle==\n{{main|Mythological Cycle}}\nThe [[Mythological Cycle]], comprising stories of the former gods and origins of the Irish, is the least well preserved of the four cycles. It is about the principle people who invaded and inhabited the island. The people include Cessair and her followers, The Formorians, The Partholinians, The Nemedians, The Firbolgs, the Tuatha De Danann, and the Milesians.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/819379953|title=Education and Celtic myth : national self-image and schoolbooks in 20th century Ireland|last=P\u00e1draic.|first=Frehan,|date=2012|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042035904|oclc=819379953}}</ref> The most important sources are the ''[[Metrical Dindshenchas]]'' or ''Lore of Places'' and the ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'' or ''Book of Invasions''. Other manuscripts preserve such mythological tales as ''[[Bodb Derg|The Dream of Aengus]]'', ''[[The Wooing Of \u00c9tain]]'' and ''[[Cath Maige Tuireadh]]'', ''The (second) Battle of Magh Tuireadh''. One of the best known of all Irish stories, ''Oidheadh Clainne Lir'', or ''[[Children of Lir|The Tragedy of the Children of Lir]]'', is also part of this cycle.\n\n(historical mythological cycle\n\n[[File:Lugh spear Millar.jpg|thumb|Lugh's Magic Spear; illustration by H. R. Millar]]\n''Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn'' is a pseudo-history of Ireland, tracing the ancestry of the Irish back to before [[Noah]]. It tells of a series of invasions or \"takings\" of Ireland by a succession of peoples, the fifth of whom was the people known as the [[Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann]] (\"Peoples of the Goddess Danu\"), who were believed to have inhabited the island before the arrival of the [[Gaels]], or [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]]. They faced opposition from their enemies, the [[Fomorians]], led by [[Balor]] of the Evil Eye. Balor was eventually slain by [[Lugh|Lug L\u00e1mfada]] (Lug of the Long Arm) at the second battle of Magh Tuireadh.  With the arrival of the Gaels, the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann retired underground to become the [[fairy]] people of later myth and legend.\n\nThe ''Metrical Dindshenchas'' is the great [[onomastic|onomastics]] work of early Ireland, giving the naming legends of significant places in a sequence of poems. It includes a lot of important information on Mythological Cycle figures and stories, including the Battle of Tailtiu, in which the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann were defeated by the Milesians.\n\nIt is important to note that by the Middle Ages the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann were not viewed so much as gods as the shape-shifting magician population of an earlier [[Golden Age]] Ireland. Texts such as ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn'' and ''Cath Maige Tuireadh'' present them as kings and heroes of the distant past, complete with death-tales. However, there is considerable evidence, both in the texts and from the wider Celtic world, that they were once considered [[deity|deities]].\n\nEven after they are displaced as the rulers of Ireland, characters such as [[Lugh|Lug]], the [[M\u00f3rr\u00edgan]], [[Aengus]] and [[Manann\u00e1n mac Lir|Manann\u00e1n Mac Lir]] appear in stories set centuries later, betraying their immortality. A poem in the Book of Leinster lists many of the Tuatha D\u00e9, but ends \"Although [the author] enumerates them, he does not worship them\". [[Goibniu]], [[Creidhne]] and [[Luchta]] are referred to as ''Tr\u00ed D\u00e9 D\u00e1na'' (\"three gods of craftsmanship\"), and the [[Dagda]]'s name is interpreted in [[medieval]] texts as \"the good god\". [[Nuada]] is [[cognate]] with the [[Prehistoric Britain|British]] god [[Nodens]]; [[Lugh|Lug]] is a reflex of the pan-[[Celt]]ic deity [[Lugus]], the name of whom may indicate \"Light\"; [[Tuireann]] may be related to the [[Gaulish]] [[Taranis]]; [[Ogma]] to [[Ogmios]]; the [[Badb]] to [[Catubodua]].\n\n==Ulster cycle==\n{{main|Ulster Cycle}}\n[[File:Ferdiad.jpg|thumb|''Cuchulainn Carries Ferdiad Across the River'']]\nThe [[Ulster Cycle]] is traditionally set around the first century CE, and most of the action takes place in the provinces of [[Ulster]] and [[Connacht]]. It consists of a group of heroic tales dealing with the lives of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]], king of Ulster, the great hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], who was the son of Lug ([[Lugh]]), and of their friends, lovers, and enemies. These are the [[Ulaid]], or people of the North-Eastern corner of Ireland and the action of the stories centres round the royal court at [[Emain Macha]] (known in English as Navan Fort), close to the modern town of [[Armagh]]. The Ulaid had close links with the Irish colony in [[Scotland]], and part of C\u00fa Chulainn's training takes place in that colony.\n\nThe cycle consists of stories of the births, early lives and training, wooings, battles, feastings, and deaths of the heroes and reflects a warrior society in which warfare consists mainly of single combats and wealth is measured mainly in cattle. These stories are written mainly in prose. The centrepiece of the Ulster Cycle is the ''[[T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge]]''. Other important Ulster Cycle tales include ''The Tragic Death of Aife's only Son'', ''[[Bricriu]]'s Feast'', and ''[[The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel]]''. ''The Exile of the Sons of Usnach'', better known as the tragedy of [[Deirdre]] and the source of plays by [[John Millington Synge]], [[William Butler Yeats]], and [[Vincent Woods]], is also part of this cycle.\n\nThis cycle is, in some respects, close to the mythological cycle. Some of the characters from the latter reappear, and the same sort of shape-shifting magic is much in evidence, side by side with a grim, almost callous realism. While we may suspect a few characters, such as [[Medb]] or [[C\u00fa Ro\u00ed]], of once being deities, and C\u00fa Chulainn in particular displays superhuman prowess, the characters are mortal and associated with a specific time and place. If the Mythological Cycle represents a Golden Age, the Ulster Cycle is Ireland's [[Heroic Age (literary theory)|Heroic Age]].\n\n==Fenian cycle==\n{{main|Fenian Cycle}}\nLike the Ulster Cycle, the [[Fenian Cycle]], also referred to as the Ossianic Cycle, is concerned with the deeds of Irish heroes. The stories of the Fenian Cycle appear to be set around the 3rd century and mainly in the provinces of [[Leinster]] and [[Munster]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/819379953|title=Education and Celtic myth : national self-image and schoolbooks in 20th century Ireland|last=P\u00e1draic.|first=Frehan,|date=2012|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042035904|oclc=819379953}}</ref> They differ from the other cycles in the strength of their links with the Irish-speaking community in Scotland and there are many extant Fenian texts from that country. They also differ from the Ulster Cycle in that the stories are told mainly in [[Meter (poetry)|verse]] and that in tone they are nearer to the tradition of romance than the tradition of epic. The stories concern the doings of [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] and his band of soldiers, the [[Fianna]].\n\n[[File:Finn Mccool Comes to Aid the Fianna.png|thumb|[[Finn McCool]] Comes to Aid the Fianna]]\nThe single most important source for the Fenian Cycle is the ''[[Acallam na Sen\u00f3rach]]'' (''Colloquy of the Old Men''), which is found in two 15th-century manuscripts, the ''[[Book of Lismore]]'' and Laud 610, as well as a 17th-century manuscript from [[Killiney]], [[County Dublin]]. The text is dated from linguistic evidence to the 12th century. The text records conversations between [[Ca\u00edlte mac R\u00f3n\u00e1in]] and [[Ois\u00edn]], the last surviving members of the Fianna, and [[Saint Patrick]], and consists of about 8,000 lines. The late dates of the manuscripts may reflect a longer oral tradition for the Fenian stories.\n\nThe Fianna of the story are divided into the Clann Baiscne, led by Fionn mac Cumhaill (often rendered as \"Finn MacCool\", Finn Son of Cumhall), and the Clann Morna, led by his enemy, [[Goll mac Morna]]. Goll killed Fionn's father, [[Cumhal]], in battle and the boy Fionn was brought up in secrecy. As a youth, while being trained in the art of poetry, he accidentally burned his thumb while cooking the Salmon of Knowledge, which allowed him to suck or bite his thumb to receive bursts of stupendous wisdom. He took his place as the leader of his band and numerous tales are told of their adventures. Two of the greatest of the Irish tales, ''[[The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gr\u00e1inne|T\u00f3raigheacht Dhiarmada agus Ghr\u00e1inne]]'' (''The Pursuit of [[The Pursuit of Diarmuid and Gr\u00e1inne|Diarmuid]] and [[Gr\u00e1inne]])'' and ''Ois\u00edn in [[T\u00edr na n\u00d3g]]'' form part of the cycle. The Diarmuid and Grainne story, which is one of the few Fenian prose tales, is a probable source of ''[[Tristan and Iseult]]''.\n\nThe world of the Fenian Cycle is one in which professional warriors spend their time hunting, fighting, and engaging in adventures in the spirit world. New entrants into the band are expected to be knowledgeable in poetry as well as undergo a number of physical tests or ordeals.\nMost of the poems are attributed to being composed by Ois\u00edn''.'' This cycle creates a bridge between pre-Christian and Christian times.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/819379953|title=Education and Celtic myth : national self-image and schoolbooks in 20th century Ireland|last=P\u00e1draic.|first=Frehan,|date=2012|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9789042035904|oclc=819379953}}</ref> \n\n==Historical cycle==\n{{main|Cycles of the Kings}}\nIt was part of the duty of the medieval Irish bards, or court [[Irish poetry|poets]], to record the history of the family and the genealogy of the king they served. This they did in poems that blended the mythological and the historical to a greater or lesser degree. The resulting stories form what has come to be known as the [[Historical Cycle]] or Cycles of the Kings, or more correctly Cycles, as there are a number of independent groupings.\n\nThe kings that are included range from the almost entirely mythological [[Labraid Loingsech]], who allegedly became High King of Ireland around 431 BC, to the entirely historical [[Brian Boru]]. However, the greatest glory of the Historical Cycle is the ''[[Buile Shuibhne]]'' (''The Frenzy of Sweeney''), a 12th-century tale told in verse and prose. Suibhne, king of [[D\u00e1l nAraidi]], was cursed by St Ronan and became a kind of half-man, half bird, condemned to live out his life in the woods, fleeing from his human companions. The story has captured the imaginations of contemporary Irish poets and has been translated by [[Trevor Joyce]] and [[Seamus Heaney]].\n\n==Other tales==\n\n===Adventures===\nThe adventures, or ''[[echtrae]]'', are a group of stories of visits to the Irish [[Other World]] (which may be westward across the sea, underground, or simply invisible to mortals). The most famous, ''Oisin in Tir na n\u00d3g'' belongs to the Fenian Cycle, but several free-standing adventures survive, including ''The Adventure of Conle'', ''[[The Voyage of Bran|The Voyage of Bran mac Ferbail]]'', and ''The Adventure of [[L\u00f3egaire]]''.\n\n===Voyages===\nThe voyages, or ''[[immrama]]'', are tales of sea journeys and the wonders seen on them that may have resulted from the combination of the experiences of fishermen combined and the Other World elements that inform the adventures. Of the seven ''immrama'' mentioned in the manuscripts, only three have survived: the ''[[Voyage of Mael D\u00fain]]'', the ''[[Voyage of the U\u00ed Chorra]]'', and the ''[[Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla]]''. ''The Voyage of Mael Duin'' is the forerunner of the later ''[[Brendan|Voyage of St. Brendan]]''. While not as ancient, later 8th century AD works, that influenced European literature, include [[The Vision of Adamn\u00e1n]].\n\n===Folk tales===\n{{main|Irish folklore}}\nDuring the first few years of the 20th Century, [[Herminie T. Kavanagh]] wrote down many Irish folk tales which she published in magazines and in two books.  Twenty-six years after her death, the tales from her two books, ''Darby O'Gill and the Good People'', and ''Ashes of Old Wishes'' were made into the film [[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]].  Noted Irish playwright [[Lady Gregory]] also collected folk stories to preserve Irish history.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n===Primary sources in English translation===\n*Cross, Tom Peete and Clark Harris Slover.

It is a form of [[risk management]], primarily used to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] against the risk of a contingent or uncertain loss.\n\nAn entity which provides insurance is known as an insurer, insurance company, insurance carrier or [[underwriter]].  A person or entity who buys insurance is known as an insured or as a policyholder. The insurance transaction involves the insured assuming a guaranteed and known relatively small loss in the form of payment to the insurer in exchange for the insurer's promise to compensate the insured in the event of a covered loss.  The loss may or may not be financial, but it must be reducible to financial terms, and usually involves something in which the insured has an [[insurable interest]] established by ownership, possession, or preexisting relationship.\n\nThe insured receives a [[contract]], called the [[insurance policy]], which details the conditions and circumstances under which the insurer will compensate the insured. The amount of money charged by the insurer to the insured for the coverage set forth in the insurance policy is called the '''premium'''. If the insured experiences a loss which is potentially covered by the insurance policy, the insured submits a claim to the insurer for processing by a [[claims adjuster]]. The insurer may [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] its own risk by taking out [[reinsurance]], whereby another insurance company agrees to carry some of the risk, especially if the primary insurer deems the risk too large for it to carry.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of insurance}}\n\n===Early methods===\n[[File:Ferdinand Bol - Governors of the Wine Merchant's Guild - WGA2361.jpg|thumb|Merchants have sought methods to minimize risks since early times. Pictured, ''Governors of the Wine Merchant's Guild'' by [[Ferdinand Bol]], c. 1680.]]\nMethods for transferring or distributing risk were practiced by [[China|Chinese]] and [[Babylonia]]n traders as long ago as the [[3rd millennium BC|3rd]] and [[2nd millennium BC|2nd]] [[millennium|millennia]] BC, respectively.<ref>See, e.g., Vaughan, E. J., 1997, ''Risk Management'', New York: Wiley.</ref> Chinese merchants travelling treacherous river rapids would redistribute their wares across many vessels to limit the loss due to any single vessel's capsizing. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous [[Code of Hammurabi]], c. 1750 BC, and practiced by early [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] sailing [[merchant]]s. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen, or lost at sea.\n\nCirca 800 BC, the inhabitants of [[Rhodes]] created the '[[general average]]'. This allowed groups of merchants to pay to insure their goods being shipped together. The collected premiums would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during transport, whether due to storm or sinkage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LawMuseum/LawArticle-383/Lex-Rhodia-The-Ancient-Ancestor-of-Maritime-Law--800-BC.aspx|title=Lex Rhodia: The Ancient Ancestor of Maritime Law - 800 BC}}</ref>\n\nSeparate insurance contracts (i.e., insurance policies not bundled with loans or other kinds of contracts) were invented in [[Genoa]] in the 14th century, as were insurance pools backed by pledges of landed estates. The first known insurance contract dates from [[Genoa]] in 1347, and in the next century maritime insurance developed widely and premiums were intuitively varied with risks.<ref>J. Franklin, ''The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), 274-277.</ref> These new insurance contracts allowed insurance to be separated from investment, a separation of roles that first proved useful in [[marine insurance]].\n\n===Modern insurance===\nInsurance became far more sophisticated in [[Enlightenment era]] [[Europe]], and specialized varieties developed.\n\n[[File:Lloyd's coffee house drawing.jpg|right|thumb|[[Lloyd's Coffee House]] was the first organized market for marine insurance.]]\n[[Property insurance]] as we know it today can be traced to the [[Great Fire of London]], which in 1666 devoured more than 13,000 houses. The devastating effects of the fire converted the development of insurance \"from a matter of convenience into one of urgency, a change of opinion reflected in Sir [[Christopher Wren]]'s inclusion of a site for 'the Insurance Office' in his new plan for London in 1667.\"<ref>Dickson (1960): 4</ref> A number of attempted fire insurance schemes came to nothing, but in 1681, [[Economics|economist]] [[Nicholas Barbon]] and eleven associates established the first fire insurance company, the \"Insurance Office for Houses,\" at the back of the Royal Exchange to insure brick and frame homes. Initially, 5,000 homes were insured by his Insurance Office.<ref>Dickson (1960): 7</ref>\n\nAt the same time, the first insurance schemes for the [[underwriting]] of [[business venture]]s became available. By the end of the seventeenth century, London's growing importance as a center for trade was increasing demand for [[marine insurance]]. In the late 1680s, Edward Lloyd opened [[Lloyd's Coffee House|a coffee house]], which became the meeting place for parties in the shipping industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led to the establishment of the insurance market [[Lloyd's of London]] and several related shipping and insurance businesses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.oxforddnb.com/index/16/101016829 |title=Lloyd, Edward (''c''.1648\u20131713) |first=Sarah |last=Palmer |date=October 2007 |work=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography |publisher=Oxford University Press |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/16829 |accessdate=16 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715030319/http://press.oxforddnb.com/index/16/101016829/ |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:National-insurance-act-1911.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Leaflet promoting the [[National Insurance Act 1911]].]]\nThe first [[life insurance]] policies were taken out in the early 18th century.

Gilbert, ''British social policy, 1914-1939'' (1970)</ref>\n\n==Principles==\nInsurance involves [[pooling (resource management)|pooling]] funds from ''many'' insured entities (known as exposures) to pay for the losses that some may incur. The insured entities are therefore protected from risk for a fee, with the fee being dependent upon the frequency and severity of the event occurring. In order to be an [[insurable risk]], the risk insured against must meet certain characteristics. Insurance as a [[financial intermediary]] is a commercial enterprise and a major part of the financial services industry, but individual entities can also [[self-insurance|self-insure]] through saving money for possible future losses.<ref>Gollier C. (2003). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41953424?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents To Insure or Not to Insure?: An Insurance Puzzle]. ''The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance Theory''.</ref>\n\n===Insurability===\n{{Main|Insurability}}\n\nRisk which can be insured by private companies typically shares seven common characteristics:<ref>This discussion is adapted from Mehr and Camack \"Principles of Insurance\", 6th edition, 1976, pp 34 \u2013 37.</ref>\n\n# '''Large number of similar exposure units''': Since insurance operates through pooling resources, the majority of insurance policies are provided for individual members of large classes, allowing insurers to benefit from the [[law of large numbers]] in which predicted losses are similar to the actual losses. Exceptions include [[Lloyd's of London]], which is famous for insuring the life or health of actors, sports figures, and other famous individuals. However, all exposures will have particular differences, which may lead to different premium rates.\n# '''Definite loss''': The loss takes place at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example is death of an insured person on a life insurance policy. [[Fire]], [[Traffic collision|automobile accidents]], and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. [[Occupational disease]], for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.\n# '''Accidental loss''': The event that constitutes the trigger of a claim should be fortuitous, or at least outside the control of the beneficiary of the insurance. The loss should be pure, in the sense that it results from an event for which there is only the opportunity for cost. Events that contain speculative elements such as ordinary business risks or even purchasing a lottery ticket are generally not considered insurable.\n# '''Large loss''': The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured. Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a buyer.\n# '''Affordable premium''': If the likelihood of an insured event is so high, or the cost of the event so large, that the resulting premium is large relative to the amount of protection offered, then it is not likely that the insurance will be purchased, even if on offer. Furthermore, as the accounting profession formally recognizes in financial accounting standards, the premium cannot be so large that there is not a reasonable chance of a significant loss to the insurer. If there is no such chance of loss, then the transaction may have the form of insurance, but not the substance (see the U.S. [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] pronouncement number 113: \"Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts\").\n# '''Calculable loss''': There are two elements that must be at least estimable, if not formally calculable: the probability of loss, and the attendant cost. Probability of loss is generally an empirical exercise, while cost has more to do with the ability of a reasonable person in possession of a copy of the insurance policy and a proof of loss associated with a claim presented under that policy to make a reasonably definite and objective evaluation of the amount of the loss recoverable as a result of the claim.\n# '''Limited risk of catastrophically large losses''': Insurable losses are ideally [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] and non-catastrophic, meaning that the losses do not happen all at once and individual losses are not severe enough to bankrupt the insurer; insurers may prefer to limit their exposure to a loss from a single event to some small portion of their capital base. [[Capital (economics)|Capital]] constrains insurers' ability to sell [[earthquake insurance]] as well as wind insurance in [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]] zones. In the United States, [[flood insurance|flood risk]] is insured by the federal government. In commercial fire insurance, it is possible to find single properties whose total exposed value is well in excess of any individual insurer's capital constraint. Such properties are generally shared among several insurers, or are insured by a single insurer who syndicates the risk into the [[reinsurance]] market.\n\n===Legal===\nWhen a company insures an individual entity, there are basic legal requirements and regulations. Several commonly cited legal principles of insurance include:<ref>Irish Brokers Association. [https://www.iba.ie/development2009/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=167 Insurance Principles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411184958/http://www.iba.ie/development2009/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76&Itemid=167 |date=2009-04-11 }}.</ref>\n# [[Indemnity]] \u2013 the insurance company indemnifies, or compensates, the insured in the case of certain losses only up to the insured's interest.\n# Benefit insurance \u2013 as it is stated in the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, the insurance company does not have the right of recovery from the party who caused the injury and is to compensate the Insured regardless of the fact that Insured had already sued the negligent party for the damages (for example, personal accident insurance)\n# [[Insurable interest]] \u2013 the insured typically must directly suffer from the loss.  Insurable interest must exist whether property insurance or insurance on a person is involved.  The concept requires that the insured have a \"stake\" in the loss or damage to the life or property insured.  What that \"stake\" is will be determined by the kind of insurance involved and the nature of the property ownership or relationship between the persons.  The requirement of an insurable interest is what distinguishes insurance from [[gambling]].\n# [[Good faith (law)|Utmost good faith]] \u2013 ([[Uberrima fides]]) the insured and the insurer are bound by a [[good faith]] bond of honesty and fairness.  Material facts must be disclosed.\n# Contribution \u2013 insurers which have similar obligations to the insured contribute in the indemnification, according to some method.\n# Subrogation \u2013 the insurance company acquires legal rights to pursue recoveries on behalf of the insured; for example, the insurer may sue those liable for the insured's loss. The Insurers can waive their subrogation rights by using the special clauses.\n# Causa proxima, or [[proximate cause]] \u2013 the cause of loss (the peril) must be covered under the insuring agreement of the policy, and the dominant cause must not be [[exclusion clause|excluded]]\n# Mitigation \u2013 In case of any loss or casualty, the asset owner must attempt to keep loss to a minimum, as if the asset was not insured.\n\n===Indemnification===\n{{Main|Indemnity}}\nTo \"indemnify\" means to make whole again, or to be reinstated to the position that one was in, to the extent possible, prior to the happening of a specified event or peril. Accordingly, [[life insurance]] is generally not considered to be indemnity insurance, but rather \"contingent\" insurance (i.e., a claim arises on the occurrence of a specified event). There are generally three types of insurance contracts that seek to indemnify an insured:\n# A \"reimbursement\" policy\n# A \"pay on behalf\" or \"on behalf of policy\"<ref name=\"KulpHall\">C. Kulp & J. Hall, Casualty Insurance, Fourth Edition, 1968, page 35</ref>\n# An \"indemnification\" policy\n\nFrom an insured's standpoint, the result is usually the same: the insurer pays the loss and claims expenses.\n\nIf the Insured has a \"reimbursement\" policy, the insured can be required to pay for a loss and then be \"reimbursed\" by the insurance carrier for the loss and out of pocket costs including, with the permission of the insurer, claim expenses.<ref name=\"KulpHall\"/><ref>However, bankruptcy of the insured with a \"reimbursement\" policy does not relieve the insurer.  Certain types of insurance, e.g., workers' compensation and personal automobile liability, are subject to statutory requirements that injured parties have direct access to coverage.</ref>\n\nUnder a \"pay on behalf\" policy, the insurance carrier would defend and pay a claim on behalf of the insured who would not be out of pocket for anything. Most modern liability insurance is written on the basis of \"pay on behalf\" language which enables the insurance carrier to manage and control the claim.\n\nUnder an \"indemnification\" policy, the insurance carrier can generally either \"reimburse\" or \"pay on behalf of\", whichever is more beneficial to it and the insured in the claim handling process.\n\nAn entity seeking to transfer risk (an individual, corporation, or association of any type, etc.) becomes the 'insured' party once risk is assumed by an 'insurer', the insuring party, by means of a [[contract]], called an [[insurance policy]]. Generally, an insurance contract includes, at a minimum, the following elements: identification of participating parties (the insurer, the insured, the beneficiaries), the premium, the period of coverage, the particular loss event covered, the amount of coverage (i.e., the amount to be paid to the insured or beneficiary in the event of a loss), and [[Exclusion clause|exclusions]] (events not covered). An insured is thus said to be \"[[indemnity|indemnified]]\" against the loss covered in the policy.\n\nWhen insured parties experience a loss for a specified peril, the coverage entitles the policyholder to make a claim against the insurer for the covered amount of loss as specified by the policy. The fee paid by the insured to the insurer for assuming the risk is called the premium. Insurance premiums from many insureds are used to fund accounts reserved for later payment of claims \u2013 in theory for a relatively few claimants \u2013 and for [[Overhead (business)|overhead]] costs. So long as an insurer maintains adequate funds set aside for anticipated losses (called reserves), the remaining margin is an insurer's [[Profit (accounting)|profit]].\n\n==Social effects==\nInsurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.\n\nInsurance can influence the probability of losses through [[moral hazard]], [[insurance fraud]], and preventive steps by the insurance company. Insurance scholars have typically used [[moral hazard]] to refer to the increased loss due to unintentional carelessness and insurance fraud to refer to increased risk due to intentional carelessness or indifference.<ref name=\"ZweifelEisen2012\">{{cite book|author1=Peter Zweifel|author2=Roland Eisen|title=Insurance Economics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_8qzz5soE8C&pg=PA268|date=24 February 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-20547-7|pages=268\u2013}}</ref> Insurers attempt to address carelessness through inspections, policy provisions requiring certain types of maintenance, and possible discounts for loss mitigation efforts. While in theory insurers could encourage investment in loss reduction, some commentators have argued that in practice insurers had historically not aggressively pursued loss control measures\u2014particularly to prevent disaster losses such as hurricanes\u2014because of concerns over rate reductions and legal battles. However, since about 1996 insurers have begun to take a more active role in loss mitigation, such as through [[building code]]s.<ref>Kunreuther H. (1996). [http://opim.wharton.upenn.edu/risk/downloads/archive/arch167.pdf Mitigating Disaster Losses Through Insurance]. ''Journal of Risk and Uncertainty''.</ref>\n\n===Methods of insurance===\nAccording to the study books of The Chartered Insurance Institute, there are variant methods of insurance as follows:\n# Co-insurance \u2013 risks shared between insurers \n# Dual insurance \u2013 having two or more policies with overlapping coverage of a risk (both the individual policies would not pay separately \u2013 under a concept named contribution, they would contribute together to make up the policyholder's losses. However, in case of contingency insurances such as life insurance, dual payment is allowed) \n# Self-insurance \u2013 situations where risk is not transferred to insurance companies and solely retained by the entities or individuals themselves\n# Reinsurance \u2013 situations when the insurer passes some part of or all risks to another Insurer, called the reinsurer\n\n==Insurers' business model==\n[[File:Accidents will happen William-H.-Watson-Universal-Star-Featurette-1922.webm|thumb|''Accidents will happen'' (William H. Watson, 1922) is a slapstick silent film about the methods and mishaps of an insurance broker. Collection [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]].]]\n\n===Underwriting and investing===\nThe business model is to collect more in premium and investment income than is paid out in losses, and to also offer a competitive price which consumers will accept. Profit can be reduced to a simple equation:\n:Profit = [[cancellation (insurance)|earned premium]] + investment income \u2013 incurred loss \u2013 underwriting expenses.\n\nInsurers make money in two ways:\n* Through [[underwriting]], the process by which insurers select the risks to insure and decide how much in premiums to charge for accepting those risks\n* By [[investment|investing]] the premiums they collect from insured parties\n\nThe most complicated aspect of the insurance business is the [[actuarial science]] of ratemaking (price-setting) of policies, which uses [[statistics]] and [[probability]] to approximate the rate of future claims based on a given risk. After producing rates, the insurer will use discretion to reject or accept risks through the underwriting process.\n\nAt the most basic level, initial ratemaking involves looking at the [[frequency]] and [[wikt:severity|severity]] of insured perils and the expected average payout resulting from these perils. Thereafter an insurance company will collect historical loss data, bring the loss data to [[present value]], and compare these prior losses to the premium collected in order to assess rate adequacy.<ref>Brown RL. (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=1j4O50JENE4C Introduction to Ratemaking and Loss Reserving for Property and Casualty Insurance]. ACTEX Publications.</ref> [[Loss ratio]]s and expense loads are also used. Rating for different risk characteristics involves at the most basic level comparing the losses with \"loss relativities\"\u2014a policy with twice as many losses would therefore be charged twice as much. More complex [[multivariate analysis|multivariate analyses]] are sometimes used when multiple characteristics are involved and a univariate analysis could produce confounded results. Other statistical methods may be used in assessing the probability of future losses.\n\nUpon termination of a given policy, the amount of premium collected minus the amount paid out in claims is the insurer's [[underwriting profit]] on that policy. Underwriting performance is measured by something called the \"combined ratio\", which is the ratio of expenses/losses to premiums.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Juc4fb1Fx1cC&lpg=PA614&pg=PA614#v=onepage&f=false |title=The Handbook of Municipal Bonds|first1=Sylvan G.|last1=Feldstein|first2=Frank J.|last2=Fabozzi|year=2008|page=614|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons|Wiley]]|isbn=978-0-470-10875-8|location=|accessdate=February 8, 2010}}</ref> A combined ratio of less than 100% indicates an underwriting profit, while anything over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. A company with a combined ratio over 100% may nevertheless remain profitable due to investment earnings.\n\nInsurance companies earn [[investment]] profits on \"float\". Float, or available reserve, is the amount of money on hand at any given moment that an insurer has collected in insurance premiums but has not paid out in claims. Insurers start investing insurance premiums as soon as they are collected and continue to earn interest or other income on them until claims are paid out. The [[Association of British Insurers]] (gathering 400 insurance companies and 94% of UK insurance services) has almost 20% of the investments in the [[London Stock Exchange]].<ref>[http://www.abi.org.uk/About_The_ABI/role.aspx What we do ABI] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907134048/http://www.abi.org.uk/About_The_ABI/role.aspx |date=2009-09-07 }}. Abi.org.uk. Retrieved on 2013-07-18.</ref>\n\nIn the [[United States]], the underwriting loss of [[property insurance|property]] and [[casualty insurance]] companies was $142.3 billion in the five years ending 2003. But overall profit for the same period was $68.4 billion, as the result of float. Some insurance industry insiders, most notably [[Maurice R. Greenberg|Hank Greenberg]], do not believe that it is forever possible to sustain a profit from float without an underwriting profit as well, but this opinion is not universally held.\n\nNaturally, the float method is difficult to carry out in an [[Depression (economics)|economically depressed]] period. [[Bear market]]s do cause insurers to shift away from investments and to toughen up their underwriting standards, so a poor economy generally means high insurance premiums. This tendency to swing between profitable and unprofitable periods over time is commonly known as the [[insurance cycle|underwriting, or insurance, cycle]].<ref>Fitzpatrick, Sean, [http://ssrn.com/abstract=690316 ''Fear is the Key: A Behavioral Guide to Underwriting Cycles,''] 10 Conn. Ins. L.J. 255 (2004).</ref>\n\n===Claims===\nClaims and loss handling is the materialized utility of insurance; it is the actual \"product\" paid for.  Claims may be filed by insureds directly with the insurer or through [[Insurance broker|brokers or agents]].  The insurer may require that the claim be filed on its own proprietary forms, or may accept claims on a standard industry form, such as those produced by [[ACORD]].\n\nInsurance company claims departments employ a large number of [[claims adjuster]]s supported by a staff of [[records management]] and [[data entry clerk]]s.  Incoming claims are classified based on severity and are assigned to adjusters whose settlement authority varies with their knowledge and experience.  The adjuster undertakes an investigation of each claim, usually in close cooperation with the insured, determines if coverage is available under the terms of the insurance contract, and if so, the reasonable monetary value of the claim, and authorizes payment.\n\nThe policyholder may hire their own [[public adjuster]] to negotiate the settlement with the insurance company on their behalf. For policies that are complicated, where claims may be complex, the insured may take out a separate insurance policy add-on, called loss recovery insurance, which covers the cost of a public adjuster in the case of a claim.\n\nAdjusting liability insurance claims is particularly difficult because there is a third party involved, the [[plaintiff]], who is under no contractual obligation to cooperate with the insurer and may in fact regard the insurer as a [[deep pocket]]. The adjuster must obtain legal counsel for the insured (either inside \"house\" counsel or outside \"panel\" counsel), monitor litigation that may take years to complete, and appear in person or over the telephone with settlement authority at a mandatory settlement conference when requested by the judge.\n\nIf a claims adjuster suspects under-insurance, the [[condition of average]] may come into play to limit the insurance company's exposure.\n\nIn managing the claims handling function, insurers seek to balance the elements of customer satisfaction, administrative handling expenses, and claims overpayment leakages.  As part of this balancing act, [[insurance fraud|fraudulent insurance practices]] are a major business risk that must be managed and overcome. Disputes between insurers and insureds over the validity of claims or claims handling practices occasionally escalate into litigation (see [[insurance bad faith]]).\n\n===Marketing===\nInsurers will often use [[agency (law)|insurance agents]] to initially market or underwrite their customers. Agents can be captive, meaning they write only for one company, or independent, meaning that they can issue policies from several companies. The existence and success of companies using insurance agents is likely due to improved and personalized service. Companies also use Broking firms, Banks and other corporate entities (like Self Help Groups, Microfinance Institutions, NGOs etc.) to market their products.<ref>{{cite journal\n |first1  = Allen N.\n |last1   = Berger\n |first2  = J.

Specific kinds of risk that may give rise to claims are known as perils. An insurance policy will set out in detail which perils are covered by the policy and which are not. Below are non-exhaustive lists of the many different types of insurance that exist. A single policy that may cover risks in one or more of the categories set out below. For example, [[vehicle insurance]] would typically cover both the property risk (theft or damage to the vehicle) and the liability risk (legal claims arising from an [[traffic collision|accident]]). A [[home insurance]] policy in the United States typically includes coverage for damage to the home and the owner's belongings, certain legal claims against the owner, and even a small amount of coverage for medical expenses of guests who are injured on the owner's property.\n\n[[Business]] insurance can take a number of different forms, such as the various kinds of professional liability insurance, also called professional indemnity (PI), which are discussed below under that name; and the [[business owner's policy]] (BOP), which packages into one policy many of the kinds of coverage that a business owner needs, in a way analogous to how homeowners' insurance packages the coverages that a homeowner needs.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = Business insurance information.

Depending on the company's specific policies it might or might not cover the deductible as well. This coverage is marketed for those who put low [[down payment]]s, have high interest rates on their loans, and those with 60-month or longer terms. Gap insurance is typically offered by a finance company when the vehicle owner purchases their vehicle, but many auto insurance companies offer this coverage to consumers as well.\n\n===Health insurance===\n{{Main|Health insurance|Dental insurance}}\n[[File:Great western hospital.JPG|right|thumb|Great Western Hospital, [[Swindon]]]]\n\nHealth insurance policies cover the cost of medical treatments. Dental insurance, like medical insurance, protects policyholders for dental costs. In most developed countries, all citizens receive some health coverage from their governments, paid for by taxation. In most countries, health insurance is often part of an employer's benefits.\n\n===Income protection insurance===\n[[File:Pipe installation 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Workers' compensation]], or employers' liability insurance, is compulsory in some countries]]\n* [[Disability insurance]] policies provide financial support in the event of the policyholder becoming unable to work because of disabling illness or injury. It provides monthly support to help pay such obligations as [[mortgage loan]]s and [[credit card]]s. Short-term and long-term disability policies are available to individuals, but considering the expense, long-term policies are generally obtained only by those with at least six-figure incomes, such as doctors, lawyers, etc. Short-term disability insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months, paying a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities.\n* Long-term disability insurance covers an individual's expenses for the long term, up until such time as they are considered permanently disabled and thereafter Insurance companies will often try to encourage the person back into employment in preference to and before declaring them unable to work at all and therefore totally disabled.\n* [[Business overhead expense disability insurance|Disability overhead insurance]] allows business owners to cover the overhead expenses of their business while they are unable to work.\n* [[Total permanent disability insurance]] provides benefits when a person is permanently disabled and can no longer work in their profession, often taken as an adjunct to life insurance.\n* [[Workers' compensation]] insurance replaces all or part of a worker's [[wage]]s lost and accompanying medical expenses incurred because of a job-related injury.\n\n===Casualty insurance===\n{{Main|Casualty insurance}}\nCasualty insurance insures against accidents, not necessarily tied to any specific property. It is a broad spectrum of insurance that a number of other types of insurance could be classified, such as auto, workers compensation, and some liability insurances.\n* Crime insurance is a form of casualty insurance that covers the policyholder against losses arising from the [[criminal act]]s of third parties.  For example, a company can obtain crime insurance to cover losses arising from [[theft]] or [[embezzlement]].\n* [[Terrorism insurance]] provides protection against any loss or damage caused by [[terrorism|terrorist]] activities. In the United States in the wake of [[september 11 attacks|9/11]], the [[Terrorism Risk Insurance Act]] 2002 (TRIA) set up a federal program providing a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. The program was extended until the end of 2014 by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act 2007 (TRIPRA).\n* [[Kidnap and ransom insurance]] is designed to protect individuals and corporations operating in high-risk areas around the world against the perils of kidnap, extortion, wrongful detention and hijacking.\n* [[Political risk insurance]] is a form of casualty insurance that can be taken out by businesses with operations in countries in which there is a risk that [[revolution]] or other [[politics|political]] conditions could result in a loss.\n\n===Life insurance===\n{{Main|Life insurance}}\n[[File:Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office, Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, London, 1801.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Amicable Society for a Perpetual Assurance Office]], Serjeants' Inn, Fleet Street, [[London]], 1801]]\nLife insurance provides a monetary benefit to a decedent's family or other designated beneficiary, and may specifically provide for income to an insured person's family, burial, funeral and other final expenses. Life insurance policies often allow the option of having the proceeds paid to the beneficiary either in a lump sum cash payment or an [[Annuity (financial contracts)|annuity]]. In most states, a person cannot purchase a policy on another person without their knowledge.\n\nAnnuities provide a stream of payments and are generally classified as insurance because they are issued by insurance companies, are regulated as insurance, and require the same kinds of actuarial and investment management expertise that life insurance requires. Annuities and [[pension]]s that pay a benefit for life are sometimes regarded as insurance against the possibility that a [[retirement|retiree]] will outlive his or her financial resources. In that sense, they are the complement of life insurance and, from an underwriting perspective, are the mirror image of life insurance.\n\nCertain life insurance contracts accumulate [[cash]] values, which may be taken by the insured if the policy is surrendered or which may be borrowed against. Some policies, such as annuities and [[endowment policy|endowment policies]], are financial instruments to accumulate or [[liquidation|liquidate]] [[wealth]] when it is needed.\n\nIn many countries, such as the United States and the UK, the [[tax law]] provides that the interest on this cash value is not taxable under certain circumstances. This leads to widespread use of life insurance as a tax-efficient method of [[saving]] as well as protection in the event of early death.\n\nIn the United States, the tax on interest income on life insurance policies and annuities is generally deferred. However, in some cases the benefit derived from [[tax deferral]] may be offset by a low return. This depends upon the insuring company, the type of policy and other variables (mortality, market return, etc.). Moreover, other income tax saving vehicles (e.g., IRAs, 401(k) plans, Roth IRAs) may be better alternatives for value accumulation.\n\n===Burial insurance===\nBurial insurance is a very old type of life insurance which is paid out upon death to cover final expenses, such as the cost of a [[funeral]]. The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] introduced burial insurance c.&nbsp;600 CE when they organized [[guild]]s called \"benevolent societies\" which cared for the surviving families and paid funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the [[Middle Ages]] served a similar purpose, as did friendly societies during Victorian times.\n\n===Property===\n{{Main|Property insurance}}\n[[File:Tornado Damage, Illinois 2.JPG|right|thumb|This [[tornado]] damage to an [[Illinois]] home would be considered an \"[[Act of God]]\" for insurance purposes]]\nProperty insurance provides protection against risks to property, such as [[fire]], [[theft]] or [[weather]] damage. This may include specialized forms of insurance such as fire insurance, [[flood insurance]], [[earthquake insurance]], [[home insurance]], inland marine insurance or [[boiler insurance]].\nThe term ''property insurance'' may, like casualty insurance, be used as a broad category of various subtypes of insurance, some of which are listed below:\n\n[[File:Plane crash into Hudson River muchcropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[US Airways Flight 1549]] was [[Write-off|written off]] after ditching into the [[Hudson River]]]]\n* [[Aviation insurance]] protects [[aircraft]] hulls and spares, and associated liability risks, such as passenger and third-party liability. [[Airport]]s may also appear under this subcategory, including air traffic control and refuelling operations for international airports through to smaller domestic exposures.\n* [[Boiler insurance]] (also known as boiler and machinery insurance, or equipment breakdown insurance) insures against accidental physical damage to boilers, equipment or machinery.\n* [[Builder's risk insurance]] insures against the risk of physical loss or damage to property during construction. Builder's risk insurance is typically written on an \"all risk\" basis covering damage arising from any cause (including the negligence of the insured) not otherwise expressly excluded. Builder's risk insurance is coverage that protects a person's or organization's insurable interest in materials, fixtures or equipment being used in the construction or renovation of a building or structure should those items sustain physical loss or damage from an insured peril.<ref>{{cite web|title=Builder's Risk Insurance: Specialized Coverage for Construction Projects|url=http://adjustersinternational.com/publications/adjusting-today/builders-risk-insurance/1/|website=Adjusting Today|publisher=Adjusters International|accessdate=2009-10-16}}</ref>\n* [[Crop insurance]] may be purchased by farmers to reduce or manage various risks associated with growing crops. Such risks include crop loss or damage caused by weather, hail, drought, frost damage, insects, or disease.<ref>{{US patent application|20060287896}} \"Method for providing crop insurance for a crop associated with a defined attribute\"</ref>\n* [[Earthquake insurance]] is a form of property insurance that pays the policyholder in the event of an [[earthquake]] that causes damage to the property. Most ordinary home insurance policies do not cover earthquake damage. Earthquake insurance policies generally feature a high [[deductible]].  Rates depend on location and hence the likelihood of an earthquake, as well as the [[Earthquake engineering|construction of the home]].\n* [[Fidelity bond]] is a form of casualty insurance that covers policyholders for losses incurred as a result of fraudulent acts by specified individuals. It usually insures a business for losses caused by the dishonest acts of its employees.\n\n[[File:FEMA - 14947 - Photograph by Jocelyn Augustino taken on 08-30-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Katrina]] caused over $80 billion of storm and flood damage]]\n* [[Flood insurance]] protects against property loss due to flooding. Many U.S. insurers do not provide flood insurance in some parts of the country. In response to this, the federal government created the [[National Flood Insurance Program]] which serves as the insurer of last resort.\n* [[Home insurance]], also commonly called hazard insurance or homeowners insurance (often abbreviated in the real estate industry as HOI), provides coverage for damage or destruction of the policyholder's home. In some geographical areas, the policy may exclude certain types of risks, such as flood or earthquake, that require additional coverage. Maintenance-related issues are typically the homeowner's responsibility. The policy may include inventory, or this can be bought as a separate policy, especially for people who rent housing. In some countries, insurers offer a package which may include liability and legal responsibility for injuries and property damage caused by members of the household, including pets.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = What is homeowners insurance? | url = http://www.iii.org/individuals/homei/hbasics/whatis/ | accessdate = 2008-11-11 }}</ref>\n* [[Landlords' insurance|Landlord insurance]] covers residential and commercial properties which are rented to others. Most homeowners' insurance covers only owner-occupied homes.\n* [[Marine insurance]] and marine cargo insurance cover the loss or damage of vessels at sea or on [[Inland waterways of the United States|inland waterway]]<nowiki/>s, and of cargo in transit, regardless of the method of transit. When the owner of the cargo and the carrier are separate corporations, marine cargo insurance typically compensates the owner of cargo for losses sustained from fire, shipwreck, etc., but excludes losses that can be recovered from the carrier or the carrier's insurance. Many marine insurance underwriters will include \"time element\" coverage in such policies, which extends the indemnity to cover loss of profit and other business expenses attributable to the delay caused by a covered loss.\n* Supplemental natural disaster insurance covers specified expenses after a natural disaster renders the policyholder's home uninhabitable. Periodic payments are made directly to the insured until the home is rebuilt or a specified time period has elapsed.\n* [[Surety bond]] insurance is a three-party insurance guaranteeing the performance of the principal.\n[[File:WTC smoking on 9-11.jpeg|thumb|right|The demand for [[terrorism insurance]] surged after [[september 11 attacks|9/11]]]]\n* Volcano insurance is a specialized insurance protecting against damage arising specifically from [[Volcano|volcanic eruptions]].\n* Windstorm insurance is an insurance covering the damage that can be caused by wind events such as [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]].\n\n===Liability===\n{{Main|Liability insurance}}\nLiability insurance is a very broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect of liability coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured in the event of a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect of liability insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense in the event of a lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.\n\n[[File:Sign of the Times-Foreclosure.jpg|thumb|right|The [[subprime mortgage crisis]] was the source of many [[liability insurance]] losses]]\n* [[Public liability]] insurance or general liability insurance covers a business or organization against claims should its operations injure a member of the public or damage their property in some way.\n* [[Directors and officers liability insurance]] (D&O) protects an organization (usually a corporation) from costs associated with litigation resulting from errors made by directors and officers for which they are liable.\n* Environmental liability or environmental impairment insurance protects the insured from bodily injury, property damage and cleanup costs as a result of the dispersal, release or escape of pollutants.\n* [[Professional liability insurance|Errors and omissions insurance]] (E&O) is business liability insurance for professionals such as insurance agents, real estate agents and brokers, architects, third-party administrators (TPAs) and other business professionals.\n* [[Prize indemnity insurance]] protects the insured from giving away a large prize at a specific event. Examples would include offering prizes to contestants who can make a half-court shot at a [[basketball]] game, or a [[hole in one|hole-in-one]] at a [[golf]] tournament.\n* [[Professional liability insurance]], also called [[professional indemnity insurance]] (PI), protects insured professionals such as architectural corporations and medical practitioners against potential negligence claims made by their patients/clients.  Professional liability insurance may take on different names depending on the profession.  For example, professional liability insurance in reference to the medical profession may be called [[medical malpractice]] insurance.\nOften a commercial insured's liability insurance program consists of several layers.  The first layer of insurance generally consists of primary insurance, which provides first dollar indemnity for judgments and settlements up to the limits of liability of the primary policy.  Generally, primary insurance is subject to a deductible and obligates the insured to defend the insured against lawsuits, which is normally accomplished by assigning counsel to defend the insured.  In many instances, a commercial insured may elect to self-insure.  Above the primary insurance or self-insured retention, the insured may have one or more layers of excess insurance to provide coverage additional limits of indemnity protection. There are a variety of types of excess insurance, including \"stand-alone\" excess policies (policies that contain their own terms, conditions, and exclusions), \"follow form\" excess insurance (policies that follow the terms of the underlying policy except as specifically provided), and \"umbrella\" insurance policies (excess insurance that in some circumstances could provide coverage that is broader than the underlying insurance).<ref>{{Cite journal |url = |title =Excess Liability Insurance: Law and Litigation |last = Seaman|first = S.

Mortgage insurance is a form of credit insurance, although the name \"credit insurance\" more often is used to refer to policies that cover other kinds of debt.\n* Many credit cards offer payment protection plans which are a form of credit insurance.\n* [[Trade credit insurance]] is business insurance over the accounts receivable of the insured. The policy pays the policy holder for covered accounts receivable if the debtor defaults on payment.\n* [[Collateral protection insurance]] (CPI) insures property (primarily vehicles) held as collateral for loans made by lending institutions.\n\n===Other types===\n* All-risk insurance is an insurance that covers a wide range of incidents and perils, except those noted in the policy. All-risk insurance is different from peril-specific insurance that cover losses from only those perils listed in the policy.<ref>[http://www.business.gov/manage/business-insurance/insurance-types.html Types of Business Insurance | SBA.gov] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629042726/http://www.business.gov/manage/business-insurance/insurance-types.html |date=2010-06-29 }}.

Coverage is typically for mortality as a result of accident, illness or disease but may extend to include infertility, in-transit loss, veterinary fees, and prospective foal.\n* [[Business interruption insurance]] covers the loss of income, and the expenses incurred, after a covered peril interrupts normal business operations.\n* [[Defense Base Act]] (DBA) insurance provides coverage for civilian workers hired by the government to perform contracts outside the United States and Canada. DBA is required for all U.S. citizens, U.S. residents, U.S. Green Card holders, and all employees or subcontractors hired on overseas government contracts. Depending on the country, foreign nationals must also be covered under DBA. This coverage typically includes expenses related to medical treatment and loss of wages, as well as disability and death benefits.\n* [[Expatriate insurance]] provides individuals and organizations operating outside of their home country with protection for automobiles, property, health, liability and business pursuits.\n* [[Legal expenses insurance]] covers policyholders for the potential costs of legal action against an institution or an individual. When something happens which triggers the need for legal action, it is known as \"the event\". There are two main types of legal expenses insurance: [[Legal expenses insurance#Before the event insurance|before the event insurance]] and [[Legal expenses insurance#After the event insurance|after the event insurance]].\n* Livestock insurance is a specialist policy provided to, for example, commercial or hobby farms, aquariums, fish farms or any other animal holding. Cover is available for mortality or economic slaughter as a result of accident, illness or disease but can extend to include destruction by government order.\n* Media liability insurance is designed to cover professionals that engage in film and television production and print, against risks such as [[defamation]].\n* Nuclear incident insurance covers damages resulting from an [[nuclear and radiation accidents|incident involving radioactive materials]] and is generally arranged at the national level. (See the [[nuclear exclusion clause]] and, for the United States, the [[Price\u2013Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act]].)\n* [[Pet insurance]] insures pets against accidents and illnesses; some companies cover routine/wellness care and burial, as well.\n* [[Pollution insurance]] usually takes the form of first-party coverage for contamination of insured property either by external or on-site sources. Coverage is also afforded for liability to third parties arising from contamination of air, water, or land due to the sudden and accidental release of hazardous materials from the insured site. The policy usually covers the costs of cleanup and may include coverage for releases from underground storage tanks. Intentional acts are specifically excluded.\n* Purchase insurance is aimed at providing protection on the products people purchase. Purchase insurance can cover individual purchase protection, [[warranties]], [[guarantees]], care plans and even mobile phone insurance. Such insurance is normally very limited in the scope of problems that are covered by the policy.\n* Tax insurance is increasingly being used in corporate transactions to protect taxpayers in the event that a tax position it has taken is challenged by the IRS or a state, local, or foreign taxing authority<ref>{{cite web|last1=Blitz|first1=Gary|last2=Schoenberg|first2=Daniel|title=Private REITs: Facilitating a Cleaner Exit with Tax Insurance|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/private-reits-facilitating-cleaner-exit-tax-insurance|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}</ref>\n* [[Title insurance]] provides a guarantee that title to [[real property]] is vested in the purchaser or [[mortgage law|mortgagee]], free and clear of [[lien]]s or encumbrances. It is usually issued in conjunction with a search of the public records performed at the time of a [[real estate]] transaction.\n* [[Travel insurance]] is an insurance cover taken by those who travel abroad, which covers certain losses such as medical expenses, loss of personal belongings, travel delay, and personal liabilities.\n* [[Tuition insurance]] insures students against involuntary withdrawal from cost-intensive educational institutions\n* [[Interest rate insurance]] protects the holder from adverse changes in interest rates, for instance for those with a variable rate loan or mortgage\n* [[Divorce insurance]] is a form of contractual liability insurance that pays the insured a cash benefit if their marriage ends in divorce.\n\n===Insurance financing vehicles===\n* Fraternal insurance is provided on a cooperative basis by [[Benefit society|fraternal benefit societies]] or other social organizations.<ref>Margaret E. Lynch, Editor, \"Health Insurance Terminology\", Health Insurance Association of America, 1992, {{ISBN|1-879143-13-5}}</ref>\n* [[No-fault insurance]] is a type of insurance policy (typically automobile insurance) where insureds are indemnified by their own insurer regardless of fault in the incident.\n* Protected self-insurance is an alternative risk financing mechanism in which an organization retains the mathematically calculated cost of risk within the organization and transfers the catastrophic risk with specific and aggregate limits to an insurer so the maximum total cost of the program is known. A properly designed and underwritten Protected Self-Insurance Program reduces and stabilizes the cost of insurance and provides valuable risk management information.\n* Retrospectively rated insurance is a method of establishing a premium on large commercial accounts. The final premium is based on the insured's actual loss experience during the policy term, sometimes subject to a minimum and maximum premium, with the final premium determined by a formula. Under this plan, the current year's premium is based partially (or wholly) on the current year's losses, although the premium adjustments may take months or years beyond the current year's expiration date. The rating formula is guaranteed in the insurance contract. Formula: retrospective premium = converted loss + basic premium \u00d7 tax multiplier. Numerous variations of this formula have been developed and are in use.\n* Formal [[self-insurance]] is the deliberate decision to pay for otherwise insurable losses out of one's own money.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This can be done on a formal basis by establishing a separate fund into which funds are deposited on a periodic basis, or by simply forgoing the purchase of available insurance and paying out-of-pocket. Self-insurance is usually used to pay for high-frequency, low-severity losses. Such losses, if covered by conventional insurance, mean having to pay a premium that includes loadings for the company's general expenses, cost of putting the policy on the books, acquisition expenses, premium taxes, and contingencies. While this is true for all insurance, for small, frequent losses the transaction costs may exceed the benefit of volatility reduction that insurance otherwise affords.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n* [[Reinsurance]] is a type of insurance purchased by insurance companies or self-insured employers to protect against unexpected losses. [[Financial reinsurance]] is a form of reinsurance that is primarily used for capital management rather than to transfer insurance risk.\n* [[Social insurance]] can be many things to many people in many countries. But a summary of its essence is that it is a collection of insurance coverages (including components of life insurance, disability income insurance, unemployment insurance, health insurance, and others), plus retirement savings, that requires participation by all citizens. By forcing everyone in society to be a policyholder and pay premiums, it ensures that everyone can become a claimant when or if he/she needs to. Along the way this inevitably becomes related to other concepts such as the justice system and the [[welfare state]]. This is a large, complicated topic that engenders tremendous debate, which can be further studied in the following articles (and others):\n** [[National Insurance]]\n** [[Social safety net]]\n** [[Social security]]\n** [[Social Security debate (United States)]]\n** [[Social Security (United States)]]\n** [[Social welfare provision]]\n* [[Stop-loss insurance]] provides protection against catastrophic or unpredictable losses. It is purchased by organizations who do not want to assume 100% of the liability for losses arising from the plans. Under a stop-loss policy, the insurance company becomes liable for losses that exceed certain limits called deductibles.\n\n===Closed community and governmental self-insurance===\nSome communities prefer to create virtual insurance amongst themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to risk. A number of [[religion|religious]] groups, including the [[Amish]] and some [[Muslim]] groups, depend on support provided by their [[community|communities]] when [[disaster]]s strike. The risk presented by any given person is assumed collectively by the community who all bear the cost of rebuilding lost property and supporting people whose needs are suddenly greater after a loss of some kind. In supportive communities where others can be trusted to follow community leaders, this tacit form of insurance can work.  In this manner the community can even out the extreme differences in insurability that exist among its members. Some further justification is also provided by invoking the [[moral hazard]] of explicit insurance contracts.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], [[The Crown]] (which, for practical purposes, meant the [[civil service]]) did not insure property such as government buildings.  If a government building was damaged, the cost of repair would be met from public funds because, in the long run, this was cheaper than paying insurance premiums.  Since many UK government buildings have been sold to property companies, and rented back, this arrangement is now less common and may have disappeared altogether.\n\nIn the United States, the most prevalent form of [[self-insurance]] is governmental risk management pools. They are self-funded cooperatives, operating as carriers of coverage for the majority of governmental entities today, such as county governments, municipalities, and school districts.  Rather than these entities independently self-insure and risk bankruptcy from a large judgment or catastrophic loss, such governmental entities form a [[risk pool]]. Such pools begin their operations by capitalization through member deposits or bond issuance. Coverage (such as general liability, auto liability, professional liability, workers compensation, and property) is offered by the pool to its members, similar to coverage offered by insurance companies. However, self-insured pools offer members lower rates (due to not needing insurance brokers), increased benefits (such as loss prevention services) and subject matter expertise.  Of approximately 91,000 distinct governmental entities operating in the United States, 75,000 are members of self-insured pools in various lines of coverage, forming approximately 500 pools.  Although a relatively small corner of the insurance market, the annual contributions (self-insured premiums) to such pools have been estimated up to 17 billion dollars annually.<ref>Marcos Antonio Mendoza, \"Reinsurance as Governance: Governmental Risk Management Pools as a Case Study in the Governance Role Played by Reinsurance Institutions\", 21 Conn. Ins. L.J. 53, 55-60 (2014) http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2573253</ref>\n\n==Insurance companies==\n[[File:Republic Fire Insurance Company certificate.jpg|thumb|Certificate issued by Republic Fire Insurance Co. of New York c. 1860]]\nInsurance companies may be classified into two groups:\n* [[Life insurance]] companies, which sell life insurance, annuities and pensions products.\n* Non-life or [[property insurance|property]]/[[casualty insurance]] companies, which sell other types of insurance.\n\nGeneral insurance companies can be further divided into these sub categories.\n* Standard lines\n* [[Excess lines]]\n\nIn most countries, life and non-life insurers are subject to different regulatory regimes and different [[tax]] and [[accounting]] rules. The main reason for the distinction between the two types of company is that life, annuity, and pension business is very long-term in nature \u2013 coverage for life assurance or a pension can cover risks over many [[decade]]s. By contrast, non-life insurance cover usually covers a shorter period, such as one year.\n\nInsurance companies are generally classified as either [[Mutual insurance|mutual]] or proprietary companies.<ref>{{cite book|title=IF1 \u2013 Insurance, Legal & Regulatory|year=2011|publisher=Chartered Insurance Institute|isbn=978 0 85713 094 5|author=David Ransom|page=2/5}}</ref>  Mutual companies are owned by the policyholders, while shareholders (who may or may not own policies) own proprietary insurance companies.\n\n[[Demutualization]] of mutual insurers to form stock companies, as well as the formation of a hybrid known as a mutual holding company, became common in some countries, such as the United States, in the late 20th century.  However, not all states permit mutual holding companies.\n\nOther possible forms for an insurance company include [[reciprocal inter-insurance exchange|reciprocals]], in which policyholders reciprocate in sharing risks, and Lloyd's organizations.\n\nInsurance companies are rated by various agencies such as [[A.&nbsp;M. Best]]. The ratings include the company's financial strength, which measures its ability to pay claims. It also rates financial instruments issued by the insurance company, such as bonds, notes, and securitization products.\n\n[[Reinsurance]] companies are insurance companies that sell policies to other insurance companies, allowing them to reduce their risks and protect themselves from very large losses. The reinsurance market is dominated by a few very large companies, with huge reserves. A reinsurer may also be a direct writer of insurance risks as well.\n\n[[Captive insurance]] companies may be defined as limited-purpose insurance companies established with the specific objective of financing risks emanating from their parent group or groups. This definition can sometimes be extended to include some of the risks of the parent company's customers. In short, it is an in-house self-insurance vehicle. Captives may take the form of a \"pure\" entity (which is a 100% subsidiary of the self-insured parent company); of a \"mutual\" captive (which insures the collective risks of members of an industry); and of an \"association\" captive (which self-insures individual risks of the members of a professional, commercial or industrial association). Captives represent commercial, economic and tax advantages to their sponsors because of the reductions in costs they help create and for the ease of insurance risk management and the flexibility for cash flows they generate. Additionally, they may provide coverage of risks which is neither available nor offered in the traditional insurance market at reasonable prices.\n\nThe types of risk that a captive can underwrite for their parents include property damage, public and product liability, professional indemnity, employee benefits, employers' liability, motor and medical aid expenses. The captive's exposure to such risks may be limited by the use of reinsurance.\n\nCaptives are becoming an increasingly important component of the risk management and risk financing strategy of their parent. This can be understood against the following background:\n* Heavy and increasing premium costs in almost every line of coverage\n* Difficulties in insuring certain types of fortuitous risk\n* Differential coverage standards in various parts of the world\n* Rating structures which reflect market trends rather than individual loss experience\n* Insufficient credit for deductibles or loss control efforts\n\nThere are also companies known as \"insurance consultants\". Like a mortgage broker, these companies are paid a fee by the customer to shop around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. Similar to an insurance consultant, an 'insurance broker' also shops around for the best insurance policy amongst many companies. However, with insurance brokers, the fee is usually paid in the form of commission from the insurer that is selected rather than directly from the client.\n\nNeither insurance consultants nor insurance brokers are insurance companies and no risks are transferred to them in insurance transactions. Third party administrators are companies that perform underwriting and sometimes claims handling services for insurance companies.  These companies often have special expertise that the insurance companies do not have.\n\nThe financial stability and strength of an insurance company should be a major consideration when buying an insurance contract. An insurance premium paid currently provides coverage for losses that might arise many years in the future.  For that reason, the viability of the insurance carrier is very important. In recent years, a number of insurance companies have become insolvent, leaving their policyholders with no coverage (or coverage only from a government-backed insurance pool or other arrangement with less attractive payouts for losses). A number of independent rating agencies provide information and rate the financial viability of insurance companies.\n\n==Across the world==\n[[File:2005life premia.PNG|thumb|right|Life insurance premiums written in 2005]]\n[[File:2005nonlife premia.PNG|thumb|right|Non-life insurance premiums written in 2005]]\n\nGlobal insurance premiums grew by 2.7% in inflation-adjusted terms in 2010 to $4.3 trillion, climbing above pre-crisis levels. The return to growth and record premiums generated during the year followed two years of decline in real terms. Life insurance premiums increased by 3.2% in 2010 and non-life premiums by 2.1%. While industrialised countries saw an increase in premiums of around 1.4%, insurance markets in emerging economies saw rapid expansion with 11% growth in premium income. The global insurance industry was sufficiently capitalised to withstand the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and most insurance companies restored their capital to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2010. With the continuation of the gradual recovery of the global economy, it is likely the insurance industry will continue to see growth in premium income both in industrialised countries and emerging markets in 2011.\n\nAdvanced economies account for the bulk of global insurance. With premium income of $1.62 trillion, Europe was the most important region in 2010, followed by North America $1.409 trillion and Asia $1.161 trillion. Europe has however seen a decline in premium income during the year in contrast to the growth seen in North America and Asia. The top four countries generated more than a half of premiums. The United States and Japan alone accounted for 40% of world insurance, much higher than their 7% share of the global population. Emerging economies accounted for over 85% of the world's population but only around 15% of premiums. Their markets are however growing at a quicker pace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2011-F2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105174930/http://www.thecityuk.com/assets/Uploads/Insurance-2011-F2.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-01-05}}&nbsp;{{small|(365&nbsp;KB)}} p. 2</ref> The country expected to have the biggest impact on the insurance share distribution across the world is China.

This only reduces the financial burden and not the actual chances of happening of an event. Insurance is a risk for both the insurance company and the insured.  The insurance company understands the risk involved and will perform a [[risk assessment]] when writing the policy.  As a result, the premiums may go up if they determine that the policyholder will file a claim.  If a person is financially stable and plans for life's unexpected events, they may be able to go without insurance.  However, they must have enough to cover a total and complete loss of employment and of their possessions.  Some states will accept a surety bond, a government bond, or even making a cash deposit with the state.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Insurance insulates too much===\nAn insurance company may inadvertently find that its insureds may not be as risk-averse as they might otherwise be (since, by definition, the insured has transferred the risk to the insurer), a concept known as [[moral hazard]]. This 'insulates' many from the\ntrue costs of living with risk, negating measures that can mitigate or adapt to risk and leading some to describe insurance schemes as potentially maladaptive.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Insurance as maladaptation: Resilience and the 'business as usual' paradox|url = http://epc.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/09/01/0263774X15602022|journal = Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy|date = 2015-09-01|issn = 0263-774X|pages = 0263774X15602022|doi = 10.1177/0263774X15602022|language = en|first = Paul|last = O'Hare|first2 = Iain|last2 = White|first3 = Angela|last3 = Connelly}}</ref> To reduce their own financial exposure, insurance companies have contractual clauses that mitigate their obligation to provide coverage if the insured engages in behavior that grossly magnifies their risk of loss or liability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\nFor example, life insurance companies may require higher premiums or deny coverage altogether to people who work in hazardous occupations or engage in dangerous sports.  Liability insurance providers do not provide coverage for liability arising from [[intentional tort]]s committed by or at the direction of the insured. Even if a provider desired to provide such coverage, it is against the public policy of most countries to allow such insurance to exist, and thus it is usually illegal.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Complexity of insurance policy contracts===\n[[File:UA Flight 175 hits WTC south tower 9-11 edit.jpeg|thumb|right|[[9/11]] was a major insurance loss, but there were disputes over the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]]'s insurance policy]]\nInsurance policies can be complex and some policyholders may not understand all the fees and coverages included in a policy. As a result, people may buy policies on unfavorable terms. In response to these issues, many countries have enacted detailed statutory and regulatory regimes governing every aspect of the insurance business, including minimum standards for policies and the ways in which they may be [[advertising|advertised]] and sold.\n\nFor example, most insurance policies in the English language today have been carefully drafted in [[plain English]]; the industry learned the hard way that many courts will not enforce policies against insureds when the judges themselves cannot understand what the policies are saying. Typically, courts construe ambiguities in insurance policies against the insurance company and in favor of coverage under the policy.\n\nMany institutional insurance purchasers buy insurance through an insurance broker. While on the surface it appears the broker represents the buyer (not the insurance company), and typically counsels the buyer on appropriate coverage and policy limitations, in the vast majority of cases a broker's compensation comes in the form of a commission as a percentage of the insurance premium, creating a conflict of interest in that the broker's financial interest is tilted towards encouraging an insured to purchase more insurance than might be necessary at a higher price. A broker generally holds contracts with many insurers, thereby allowing the broker to \"shop\" the [[Market (economics)|market]] for the best rates and coverage possible.\n\nInsurance may also be purchased through an agent. A tied agent, working exclusively with one insurer, represents the insurance company from whom the policyholder buys (while a free agent sells policies of various insurance companies). Just as there is a potential conflict of interest with a broker, an agent has a different type of conflict. Because agents work directly for the insurance company, if there is a claim the agent may advise the client to the benefit of the insurance company. Agents generally cannot offer as broad a range of selection compared to an insurance broker.\n\nAn independent insurance consultant advises insureds on a fee-for-service retainer, similar to an attorney, and thus offers completely independent advice, free of the financial conflict of interest of brokers or agents. However, such a consultant must still work through brokers or agents in order to secure coverage for their clients.\n\n===Limited consumer benefits===\nIn the United States, economists and consumer advocates generally consider insurance to be worthwhile for low-probability, catastrophic losses, but not for high-probability, small losses. Because of this, consumers are advised to select high [[deductible]]s and to not insure losses which would not cause a disruption in their life. However, consumers have shown a tendency to prefer low deductibles and to prefer to insure relatively high-probability, small losses over low-probability, perhaps due to not understanding or ignoring the low-probability risk. This is associated with reduced purchasing of insurance against low-probability losses, and may result in increased inefficiencies from [[moral hazard]].<ref name=Schindler1994>Schindler, R. M. (1994). [http://www.business.camden.rutgers.edu/FacultyStaff/research/schindler/Schindler%20(1994).pdf Consumer Motivation for Purchasing Low-Deductible Insurance]. In ''Marketing and Public Policy Conference Proceedings'', Vol. 4, D. J. Ringold (ed.), Chicago, IL: American Marketing Association, 147\u2013155.</ref>\n\n===Redlining===\n[[Redlining]] is the practice of denying insurance coverage in specific geographic areas, supposedly because of a high likelihood of loss, while the alleged motivation is unlawful discrimination. [[Racial profiling]] or [[redlining]] has a long history in the property insurance industry in the United States. From a review of industry underwriting and marketing materials, court documents, and research by government agencies, industry and community groups, and academics, it is clear that race has long affected and continues to affect the policies and practices of the insurance industry.<ref>''Gregory D. Squires (2003)\nRacial Profiling, Insurance Style: Insurance Redlining and the Uneven Development of Metropolitan Areas'' Journal of Urban Affairs Volume 25 Issue 4 pp. 391\u2013410, November 2003</ref>\n\nIn July 2007, The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) released a report presenting the results of a study concerning credit-based [[insurance score]]s in automobile insurance. The study found that these scores are effective predictors of risk. It also showed that African-Americans and Hispanics are substantially overrepresented in the lowest credit scores, and substantially underrepresented in the highest, while Caucasians and Asians are more evenly spread across the scores. The credit scores were also found to predict risk within each of the ethnic groups, leading the FTC to conclude that the scoring models are not solely proxies for redlining. The FTC indicated little data was available to evaluate benefit of insurance scores to consumers.<ref name=\"FTC Study\">[http://ftc.gov/opa/2007/07/facta.shtm Credit-Based Insurance Scores: Impacts on Consumers of Automobile Insurance], Federal Trade Commission (July 2007)</ref> The report was disputed by representatives of the [[Consumer Federation of America]], the National Fair Housing Alliance, the [[National Consumer Law Center]], and the Center for Economic Justice, for relying on data provided by the insurance industry.<ref>[http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2007/07/insurance_credit.html Consumers Dispute FTC Report on Insurance Credit Scoring] www.consumeraffairs.com (July 2007)</ref>\n\nAll states have provisions in their rate regulation laws or in their fair trade practice acts that prohibit unfair discrimination, often called redlining, in setting rates and making insurance available.<ref>{{cite web | author = Insurance Information Institute | authorlink = Insurance Information Institute | title = Issues Update: Regulation Modernization | url = http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/ratereg/ | accessdate = 2008-11-11 }}</ref>\n\nIn determining premiums and premium rate structures, insurers consider quantifiable factors, including location, [[credit score]]s, [[gender]], [[profession|occupation]], [[marital status]], and [[education]] level. However, the use of such factors is often considered to be unfair or unlawfully [[discrimination|discriminatory]], and the reaction against this practice has in some instances led to political disputes about the ways in which insurers determine premiums and regulatory intervention to limit the factors used.\n\nAn insurance underwriter's job is to evaluate a given risk as to the likelihood that a loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Thus, \"discrimination\" against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the risk evaluation and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting. For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment goes to the heart of the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the [[risk premium]] must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.\n\n===Insurance patents===\n{{update|date=January 2018}}\n{{Further|Insurance patent}}\nNew assurance products can now be protected from copying with a [[business method patent]] in the [[United States]].\n\nA recent example of a new insurance product that is patented is [[Usage-based insurance|Usage Based]] [[vehicle insurance|auto insurance]]. Early versions were independently invented and patented by a major US auto insurance company, [[Progressive Corporation|Progressive Auto Insurance]] ({{US patent|5797134}}) and a Spanish independent inventor, Salvador Minguijon Perez ({{Cite patent|EP|0700009}}).\n\nMany independent inventors are in favor of patenting new insurance products since it gives them protection from big companies when they bring their new insurance products to market. Independent inventors account for 70% of the new U.S. patent applications in this area.\n\nMany insurance executives are opposed to patenting insurance products because it creates a new risk for them. [[The Hartford]] insurance company, for example, recently had to pay $80 million to an independent inventor, Bancorp Services, in order to settle a patent infringement and theft of trade secret lawsuit for a type of corporate owned life insurance product invented and patented by Bancorp.\n\nThere are currently about 150 new patent applications on insurance inventions filed per year in the United States. The rate at which patents have been issued has steadily risen from 15 in 2002 to 44 in 2006.<ref>[http://marketsandpatents.com/IPB-12152006.mht (Source: Insurance IP Bulletin, December 15, 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235655/http://www.marketsandpatents.com/IPB-12152006.mht |date=September 27, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe first insurance patent to be granted was <ref>[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/result.html?sort=relevance&srch=top&query_txt=US6922720&submit=&patents=on US6922720 \"SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR INSURING DATA OVER THE INTERNET\"]</ref> including another example of an application posted was [https://web.archive.org/web/20090510094423/http://www.peertopatent.org/patent/20090055227/activity US2009005522 \"risk assessment company\"]. It was posted on March 6, 2009. This patent application describes a method for increasing the ease of changing insurance companies.<ref>Bakos, Nowotarski, \"[http://www.marketsandpatents.com/bulletin/IPB-12152008.html An Experiment in Better Patent Examination]\", Insurance IP Bulletin, December 15, 2008.</ref>\n\n=== Insurance on demand ===\nInsurance on demand (also IoD) is an insurance service that provides clients with insurance protection when they need, i.e. only episodic rather than on [[24/7 service|24/7]] basis as typically provided by traditional insurers (e.g. clients can purchase an insurance for one single flight rather than a longer-lasting travel insurance plan).\n\n===Insurance industry and rent-seeking===\nCertain insurance products and practices have been described as [[rent-seeking]] by critics.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} That is, some insurance products or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under [[United States tax law]], for example, most owners of [[annuity (US financial products)|variable annuities]] and [[variable universal life insurance|variable life insurance]] can invest their premium payments in the [[stock market]] and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only reason people use these products.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an [[inheritance tax|estate tax]] while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.\n\n===Religious concerns===\nMuslim scholars have varying opinions about life insurance. Life insurance policies that earn interest (or guaranteed bonus/NAV) are generally considered to be a form of ''[[riba]]''<ref>{{cite web | url = http://islamqa.com/en/ref/8889/insurance | title = Islam Question and Answer \u2013 The true nature of insurance and the rulings concerning it | accessdate = 2010-01-18 }}</ref> ([[usury]]) and some consider even policies that do not earn interest to be a form of ''gharar'' ([[speculation]]). Some argue that ''gharar'' is not present due to the actuarial science behind the underwriting.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503543412 | title = Life Insurance from an Islamic Perspective | accessdate = 2010-01-18 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100522222040/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&cid=1119503543412 | archive-date = 2010-05-22 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}</ref>\nJewish rabbinical scholars also have expressed reservations regarding insurance as an avoidance of God's will but most find it acceptable in moderation.<ref>{{cite web\n |url          = http://www.jabe.org/insurance.html\n |title        = Jewish Association for Business Ethics \u2013 Insurance\n |accessdate   = 2008-03-25\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100419131351/http://www.jabe.org/insurance.html\n |archive-date = 2010-04-19\n |dead-url     = yes\n |df           = \n}}</ref>\n\nSome Christians believe insurance represents a lack of faith{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} and there is a long history of resistance to commercial insurance in [[Anabaptist]] communities ([[Mennonites]], [[Amish]], [[Hutterites]], [[Brethren in Christ]]) but many participate in community-based self-insurance programs that spread risk within their communities.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/05/AR2006100501360.html\n |title=Amish Reluctantly Accept Donations\n |last=Rubinkam\n |first=Michael\n |publisher=The Washington Post\n |date=October 5, 2006\n |accessdate=2008-03-25\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n|title = The riddle of Amish culture\n|author = Donald B.

According to [[Constitution of India|constitution]], the Prime Minister must be a [[Member of Parliament, Lok Sabha|member]] of either the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house in the [[Parliament of India]]) or a [[Member of Parliament, Rajya Sabha|member]] of the [[Rajya Sabha]] (the upper house). Thus, this decision effectively removed her from office. Gandhi had asked one of her colleagues in government, Mr. [[Ashoke Kumar Sen]] to defend her in court.\n\nBut Gandhi rejected calls to resign and announced plans to appeal to the Supreme Court. The verdict was delivered by Mr Justice [[Jagmohanlal Sinha]] at Allahabad High Court. It came almost four years after the case was brought by Raj Narain, the premier's defeated opponent in the 1971 parliamentary election. Gandhi, who gave evidence in her defence during the trial, was found guilty of dishonest election practices, excessive election expenditure, and of using government machinery and officials for party purposes.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chandra|first1=Bipan|title=In the name of democracy : JP movement and the emergency, Chapter 4, Emergency imposed|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0143029670|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3K7dCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT4#v=onepage&q=yashpal}}</ref> The judge, however, rejected more serious charges of bribery against her.\n\nGandhi insisted that the conviction did not undermine her position, despite having been unseated from the lower house of parliament, Lok Sabha, by order of the High Court. She said: \"There is a lot of talk about our government not being clean, but from our experience the situation was very much worse when [opposition] parties were forming governments\". And she dismissed criticism of the way her Congress Party raised election campaign money, saying all parties used the same methods. The prime minister retained the support of her party, which issued a statement backing her. After news of the verdict spread, hundreds of supporters demonstrated outside her house, pledging their loyalty. Indian High Commissioner BK Nehru said Gandhi's conviction would not harm her political career. \"Mrs Gandhi has still today overwhelming support in the country,\" he said. \"I believe the prime minister of India will continue in office until the electorate of India decides otherwise\".\n\n====State of Emergency (1975\u20131977)====\n{{Main|The Emergency (India)}}\nGandhi moved to restore order by ordering the arrest of most of the opposition participating in the unrest. Her Cabinet and government then recommended that President [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] declare a [[state of emergency]] because of the disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder, based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the Constitution, on 25 June 1975.\n\n====Rule by decree====\n\nWithin a few months, [[President's rule]] was imposed on the two opposition party ruled states of [[Gujarat]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] thereby bringing the entire country under direct Central rule or by governments led by the ruling Congress party.<ref>Kochanek, Stanely, ''Mrs. Gandhi's Pyramid: The New Congress'', (Westview Press, Boulder, CO 1976) p. 98</ref> Police were granted powers to impose curfews and indefinitely detain citizens and all publications were subjected to substantial censorship by the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)|Ministry of Information and Broadcasting]]. Finally, the impending legislative assembly elections were indefinitely postponed, with all opposition-controlled state governments being removed by virtue of the constitutional provision allowing for a dismissal of a state government on recommendation of the state's governor.\n\nIndira Gandhi used the emergency provisions to change conflicting party members.\n{{bq|1=\nUnlike her father Jawaharlal Nehru, who preferred to deal with strong chief ministers in control of their legislative parties and state party organizations, Mrs. Gandhi set out to remove every Congress chief minister who had an independent base and to replace each of them with ministers personally loyal to her...Even so, stability could not be maintained in the states...<ref>Brass, Paul R., ''The Politics of India Since Independence'', ([[Cambridge University Press]], England 1995) p. 40</ref>}}\n\nPresident Ahmed issued [[decree|ordinances]] that did not require debate in the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]], allowing Gandhi to [[rule by decree]].\n\n====Rise of Sanjay====\nThe Emergency saw the entry of Gandhi's younger son, [[Sanjay Gandhi]], into Indian Politics. Sanjay wielded tremendous power during the emergency without holding any Government office.

The alliance was made up of [[Bharatiya Jana Sangh]], [[Indian National Congress (Organisation)|Congress (O)]], The Socialist parties, and [[Charan Singh]]'s [[Bharatiya Kranti Dal]] representing northern peasant and farmers. Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship.\" The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Indira supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), primarily due to intra-party politicking and also due to circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that Sanjay had intentions of dislodging Gandhi and the trio stood between that. Gandhi's Congress party was crushed soundly in the elections. The public realized the statement and motto of the Janata Party alliance. Indira and [[Sanjay Gandhi]] both lost their seats, and Congress was cut down to 153 seats (compared with 350 in the previous Lok Sabha), 92 of which were in the South. The Janata alliance, under the leadership of [[Morarji Desai]], came into power after the State of Emergency was lifted. The alliance parties later merged to form the [[Janata Party]] under the guidance of Gandhian leader, [[Jayaprakash Narayan]]. The other leaders of the Janata Party were [[Charan Singh]], [[Raj Narain]], [[George Fernandes]] and [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Lloyd I.| authorlink = Lloyd Rudolph|first2=Susanne|last2= Hoeber|authorlink2=Susanne Hoeber Rudolph|title=In pursuit of Lakshmi: The political economy of the Indian state|date=1989|publisher=Univ. of Chicago Pr.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226731391|pages=159\u2013178|edition=[Nachdr.]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amtV90ig9-8C&pg=PR16#v=onepage&q=1977%20janata%20}}</ref>\n\n===In opposition and return to power===\n[[File:1984 CPA 5588.jpg|thumb|upright|1984 [[USSR]] commemorative stamp]]\n\nSince Gandhi had lost her seat in the election, the defeated Congress party appointed [[Yashwantrao Chavan]] as their parliamentary party leader.

New York: Coronet Books, 1991.</ref> In response to her arrest, Indira Gandhi's [[Bholanath and Devendra Pandey|supporters hijacked]] an Indian Airlines jet and demanded her immediate release.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Tale-of-two-hijackers-One-is-Congress-candidate-other-most-wanted/articleshow/33156540.cms]</ref> However, this strategy backfired disastrously. Her arrest and long-running trial gained her great sympathy from many people. The Janata coalition was only united by its hatred of Gandhi (or \"that woman\" as some called her). The party included right wing Hindu Nationalists, Socialists and former Congress party members. With so little in common, the Morarji Desai government was bogged down by infighting. In 1979, the government started to unravel over the issue of dual loyalties of some members to Janata and the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh|RSS]]. The ambitious Union Finance minister, [[Charan Singh]], who as the Union Home Minister during the previous year had ordered arrest of Gandhi, took advantage of this and started courting the Congress. After a significant exodus from the party to Charan Singh's faction, Desai resigned in July 1979.

The main reason was the perceived bias of United States and China, the rivals of USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of USSR with arms supplies and casting of veto at United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Prior to the war Indira signed a treaty of friendship with the USSR. The USSR was not happy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing cold war with the United States. Indira was not happy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept from criticizing the Soviet Union harshly. USSR became the main arms supplier during the Indira years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Indira by the early 1980s the USSR became the largest trading partner of India.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi authorised the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in response to the ''[[Test No. 6]]'' by People's Republic of China. Gandhi saw this test as Chinese nuclear intimidation, therefore, Gandhi promoted the views of Nehru to establish India's stability and security interests as independent from those of the nuclear superpowers.\n\nThe program became fully mature in 1974, when Dr. [[Raja Ramanna]] reported to Gandhi that India had the ability to test its first nuclear weapon. Gandhi gave verbal authorisation of this [[nuclear testing|test]], and preparations were made in a long-constructed army base, the [[Indian Army]] [[Pokhran#Pokhran Test Range|Pokhran Test Range]]. In 1974, India successfully conducted an underground nuclear test, unofficially code named as \"''[[Smiling Buddha]]''\", near the desert village of [[Pokhran]] in Rajasthan. As the world was quiet by this test, a vehement protest came forward from Pakistan. Great ire was raised in Pakistan and its Prime Minister, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], described this test as \"''Indian hegemony''\" to intimidate Pakistan. In response to this [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] launched a massive campaign all over the Pakistan to make Pakistan a nuclear power. In these campaigns [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] asked the nation to get united and great slogans were raised such as ''hum ghaas aur pattay kha lay gay magar nuclear power ban k rhe gay (We will eat grass or leaves even go hungry but will get nuclear power)''. Gandhi directed a letter to [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto|Bhutto]] and, later to the world, describing the test for [[Peaceful nuclear explosion|peaceful purposes]] and India's commitment to develop its programme for industrial and scientific use.\n\n==Family, personal life and outlook==\n[[File:Indira Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajiv Gandhi and Sanjay Gandhi.jpg|thumb|Indira Gandhi, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[Rajiv Gandhi]] and [[Sanjay Gandhi]]]]\n[[File:Feroze and Indira Gandhi.JPG|thumb|alt=Personal Life|Portrait of [[Feroze Gandhi|Feroze]] and Indira Gandhi]]\n[[File:Prime Minister Indira Gandhi with Rahul Gandhi 1970.jpg|thumb|upright|Prime Minister Indira Gandhi with grandson Rahul Gandhi on her 53rd birthday, in New Delhi on 19 November 1970.]]\n\nShe married [[Feroze Gandhi]] at the age of 25, in 1942.

Her younger son Sanjay had initially been her chosen heir; but after his death in a flying accident in June 1980, Gandhi  persuaded her reluctant elder son Rajiv to quit his job as a pilot and enter politics in February 1981.

Thus, the individual atom is replaced by a never-ending [[Process philosophy|ontological process]] of individuation. Individuation is an always incomplete process, always leaving a \"pre-individual\" left-over, itself making possible future individuations.<ref>[[Gilbert Simondon]]. ''L'individuation psychique et collective'' (Paris, Aubier, 1989; reprinted in 2007 with a preface by Bernard Stiegler)</ref> The philosophy of [[Bernard Stiegler]] draws upon and modifies the work of [[Gilbert Simondon]] on individuation and also upon similar ideas in [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. For Stiegler \"the ''I'', as a psychic individual, can only be thought in relationship to ''we'', which is a collective individual. The ''I'' is constituted in adopting a collective tradition, which it inherits and in which a plurality of ''I''&nbsp;'s acknowledge each other's existence.\"<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/bernard-stiegler-culture-and-technology Bernard Stiegler: Culture and Technology], tate.org.uk, 13 May 2004</ref>\n\n==Individualism and society==\nIndividualism holds that a person taking part in society attempts to learn and discover what his or her own interests are on a personal basis, without a presumed following of the interests of a societal structure (an individualist need not be an [[Egotism|egoist]]). The individualist does not follow one particular philosophy, rather creates an amalgamation of elements of many, based on personal interests in particular aspects that he/she finds of use. On a societal level, the individualist participates on a personally structured political and moral ground. Independent thinking and opinion is a common trait of an individualist. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], claims that his concept of \"[[general will]]\" in the \"[[Social Contract (Rousseau)|social contract]]\" is not the simple collection of individual wills and that it furthers the interests of the individual (the constraint of law itself would be beneficial for the individual, as the lack of respect for the law necessarily entails, in Rousseau's eyes, a form of [[ignorance]] and submission to one's [[Passion (emotion)|passions]] instead of the preferred [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of [[reason]]).\n\nSocieties and groups can differ in the extent to which they are based upon predominantly \"self-regarding\" (individualistic, and/or self-interested) behaviors, rather than \"other-regarding\" (group-oriented, and group, or society-minded) behaviors. [[Ruth Benedict]] made a distinction, relevant in this context, between [[Guilt society|\"guilt\" societies]] (e.g., [[medieval Europe]]) with an \"internal reference standard\", and [[Shame society|\"shame\" societies]] (e.g., Japan, \"bringing shame upon one's ancestors\") with an \"external reference standard\", where people look to their peers for feedback on whether an action is \"acceptable\" or not.<ref>\"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword: Patterns of Japanese Culture.\" Rutland, VT and Tokyo, Japan: Charles E. Tuttle Co. 1954 orig. 1946.</ref>\n\nIndividualism is often contrasted<ref name=\"Hayek 1994 17, 37\u201348\"/> either with [[totalitarianism]] or with [[collectivism]], but in fact, there is a spectrum of behaviors at the societal level ranging from highly individualistic societies through mixed societies to collectivist.\n\n===Methodological individualism===\n[[Methodological individualism]] is the view that phenomena can only be understood by examining how they result from the motivations and actions of individual agents.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/methodological-individualism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Joseph|last=Heath|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=1 January 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref> In economics, people's behavior is explained in terms of rational choices, as constrained by prices and incomes. The economist accepts individuals' preferences as givens. [[Gary Becker|Becker]] and [[George Stigler|Stigler]] provide a forceful statement of this view:<blockquote>On the traditional view, an explanation of economic phenomena that reaches a difference in tastes between people or times is the terminus of the argument: the problem is abandoned at this point to whoever studies and explains tastes (psychologists? anthropologists? phrenologists? sociobiologists?). On our preferred interpretation, one never reaches this impasse: the economist continues to search for differences in prices or incomes to explain any differences or changes in behavior.''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Stigler|first=George|author2=Gary Becker|date=Mar 1977|title=De gustibus non est disputandum|journal=American Economic Review|volume=67|issue=2|page=76|jstor=1807222}}</ref>''</blockquote>\n\n===Competitive individualism===\nIt is an form of individualism that arises from competitive systems. The function of the system is to maintain an inequality in the society and fields of human engagement. This pins the ups and downs of a person's life onto themselves by not acknowledging a range of factors like influence of socioeconomic class, race, gender, etc. It supports the privilege theories that affirms position of certain individuals higher in the hierarchy of ranks at the expense of others.

Henry David Thoreau (1817\u20131862), uno de los escritores pr\u00f3ximos al movimiento de la filosof\u00eda trascendentalista, es uno de los m\u00e1s conocidos. Su obra m\u00e1s representativa es Walden, aparecida en 1854, aunque redactada entre 1845 y 1847, cuando Thoreau decide instalarse en el aislamiento de una caba\u00f1a en el bosque, y vivir en \u00edntimo contacto con la naturaleza, en una vida de soledad y sobriedad. De esta experiencia, su filosof\u00eda trata de transmitirnos la idea que resulta necesario un retorno respetuoso a la naturaleza, y que la felicidad es sobre todo fruto de la riqueza interior y de la armon\u00eda de los individuos con el entorno natural. Muchos han visto en Thoreau a uno de los precursores del ecologismo y del anarquismo primitivista representado en la actualidad por Jonh Zerzan. Para George Woodcock, esta actitud puede estar tambi\u00e9n motivada por una cierta idea de resistencia al progreso y de rechazo al materialismo creciente que caracteriza la sociedad norteamericana de mediados de siglo XIX.\"[http://www.acracia.org/1-23a58lainsumision.pdf \"Voluntary non-submission.

Is egoism morally defensible? Philosophia. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2\u20133 / July 1988</ref> is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[wikt:self-interest|self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] ''do'' only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds merely that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest. However, these doctrines may occasionally be combined with ethical egoism.\n\nEthical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[obligation]] to help and serve others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical utilitarianism, which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[self (philosophy)|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and \"the self\" to a status not granted to others), but that one also should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[well-being]]) are substantially-equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[subjectivity|subjective]]), but utilitarianism is called agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[impartial]]) as it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral \"agent's\") own interests as being more or less important than if the same interests, desires, or well-being were anyone else's.\n\nEthical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. Individualism allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily [[logical consequence|entail]] that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfilment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to the self. Fleeting pleasance, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaemonia]].

Rand thinks the only social system consistent with this morality is full respect for individual rights, embodied in pure ''[[laissez faire]]'' [[capitalism]]; and the role of [[art]] in human life is to transform man's widest metaphysical ideas, by selective reproduction of reality, into a physical form\u2014a work of art\u2014that he can comprehend and to which he can respond emotionally.

John Simmons and [[Robert Paul Wolff]].\n\n===Subjectivism===\n{{Main|Subjectivism}}\nSubjectivism is a philosophical tenet that accords primacy to subjective experience as fundamental of all measure and law. In extreme forms like [[Solipsism]], it may hold that the nature and existence of every object depends solely on someone's subjective awareness of it. For example, [[Wittgenstein]] wrote in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: \"The subject doesn't belong to the world, but it is a limit of the world\" (proposition 5.632). Metaphysical subjectivism is the theory that reality is what we perceive to be real, and that there is no underlying true reality that exists independently of perception. One can also hold that it is [[consciousness]] rather than perception that is reality ([[subjective idealism]]). In [[probability]], a subjectivism stands for the belief that probabilities are simply degrees-of-belief by rational agents in a certain proposition, and which have no objective reality in and of themselves.\n\n[[Ethical subjectivism]] stands in opposition to [[moral realism]], which claims that moral propositions refer to objective facts, independent of human opinion; to [[error theory]], which denies that any moral propositions are true in any sense; and to [[non-cognitivism]], which denies that moral sentences express propositions at all. The most common forms of ethical subjectivism are also forms of [[moral relativism]], with moral standards held to be relative to each culture or society (c.f. [[cultural relativism]]), or even to every individual. The latter view, as put forward by [[Protagoras]], holds that there are as many distinct scales of good and evil as there are subjects in the world. Moral subjectivism is that species of moral relativism that relativizes moral value to the individual subject.\n\n[[Horst Matthai Quelle]]  was a [[Spanish language]] [[Germany|German]] anarchist [[philosophy|philosopher]] influenced by [[Max Stirner]].<ref name=\"books.google.com.ec\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=E6JFPiDRlikC&pg=PA345&lpg=PA345#v=onepage&q=horst%20matthai%20el%20humanismo%20como%20problema%20humano Horst Matthai Quelle.

The term comes from [[Latin]] ''solus'' (alone) and ''ipse'' (self). Solipsism as an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position holds that [[knowledge]] of anything outside one's own mind is unsure. [[Philosophical skepticism|The external world]] and [[problem of other minds|other minds]] cannot be known, and might not exist outside the mind. As a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist. As such it is the only epistemological position that, by its own [[wikt:postulate#Pronunciation|postulate]], is both [[wikt:irrefutable#English|irrefutable]] and yet indefensible in the same manner. Although the number of individuals sincerely espousing solipsism has been small, it is not uncommon for one philosopher to accuse another's arguments of entailing solipsism as an unwanted consequence, in a kind of [[reductio ad absurdum]]. In the history of philosophy, solipsism has served as a [[skeptical hypothesis]].\n\n==Economic individualism==\nThe [[doctrine]] of economic individualism holds that each individual should be allowed [[autonomy]] in making his or her own economic decisions as opposed to those decisions being made by the state, the [[community]], the corporation etc. for him or her.\n\n===Liberalism===\n{{Main|Liberalism}}\nClassical liberalism is a political ideology that developed in the 19th century in [[England]], [[Western Europe]], and the [[Americas]]. It followed earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to personal freedom and popular government, but differed from earlier forms of liberalism in its commitment to [[free markets]] and [[classical economics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=sq-1z8VMhDEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA37#v=onepage|title=Modern Political Philosophy|first=Richard|last=Hudelson|date=1 January 1999|publisher=M.E.

Contemporary individualist anarchist [[Kevin Carson]] characterizes American individualist anarchism saying that \"Unlike the rest of the [[socialist]] movement, the individualist anarchists believed that the natural wage of labor in a free market was its product, and that economic exploitation could only take place when capitalists and landlords harnessed the power of the state in their interests. Thus, individualist anarchism was an alternative both to the increasing statism of the mainstream socialist movement, and to a [[classical liberal]] movement that was moving toward a mere apologetic for the power of big business.\" <ref>Kevin Carson.

During its 23 years, it was the most widely used format for floating-point computation. It was implemented in software, in the form of floating-point [[library (computing)|libraries]], and in hardware, in the [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] of many [[CPU]]s and [[floating-point unit|FPUs]]. The first [[integrated circuit]] to implement the draft of what was to become IEEE&nbsp;754-1985 was the [[Intel 8087]].\n\nIEEE 754-1985 represents numbers in [[binary numeral system|binary]], providing definitions for four levels of precision, of which the two most commonly used are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Level\n!Width\n!Range at full precision\n!Precision{{efn|Precision: The number of decimal digits precision is calculated via number_of_mantissa_bits * Log<sub>10</sub>(2).

See text for explanation.]]\n[[Image:IEEE 754 Double Floating Point Format.svg|right|frame|The three fields in a 64bit IEEE 754 float]]\n\nFloating-point numbers in IEEE&nbsp;754 format consist of three fields: a [[sign bit]], a [[exponent bias|biased exponent]], and a fraction. The following example illustrates the meaning of each.\n\nThe decimal number 0.15625<sub>10</sub> represented in binary is 0.00101<sub>2</sub> (that is, 1/8 + 1/32). (Subscripts indicate the number [[radix|base]].) Analogous to [[scientific notation]], where numbers are written to have a single non-zero digit to the left of the decimal point, we rewrite this number so it has a single 1 bit to the left of the \"binary point\". We simply multiply by the appropriate power of 2 to compensate for shifting the bits left by three positions:\n\n: <math>0.00101_2 = 1.01_2 \\times 2^{-3}</math>\n\nNow we can read off the fraction and the exponent: the fraction is .01<sub>2</sub> and the exponent is \u22123.\n\nAs illustrated in the pictures, the three fields in the IEEE&nbsp;754 representation of this number are:\n\n: ''sign'' = 0, because the number is positive. (1 indicates negative.)\n: ''biased exponent'' = \u22123 + the \"bias\". In '''single precision''', the bias is '''127''', so in this example the biased exponent is 124; in '''double precision''', the bias is '''1023''', so the biased exponent in this example is 1020.\n: ''fraction'' = .01000\u2026<sub>2</sub>.\n\nIEEE&nbsp;754 adds a [[offset binary|bias]] to the exponent so that numbers can in many cases be compared conveniently by the same hardware that compares signed [[2's-complement]] integers. Using a biased exponent, the lesser of two positive floating-point numbers will come out \"less than\" the greater following the same ordering as for [[sign and magnitude]] integers. If two floating-point numbers have different signs, the sign-and-magnitude comparison also works with biased exponents. However, if both biased-exponent floating-point numbers are negative, then the ordering must be reversed. If the exponent were represented as, say, a 2's-complement number, comparison to see which of two numbers is greater would not be as convenient.\n\nThe leading 1 bit is omitted since all numbers except zero start with a leading 1; the leading 1 is implicit and doesn't actually need to be stored which gives an extra bit of precision for \"free.\"\n\n=== Zero ===\n\nThe number zero is represented specially:\n\n: ''sign'' = 0 for [[signed zero|positive zero]], 1 for [[signed zero|negative zero]].\n: ''biased exponent'' = 0.\n: ''fraction'' = 0.\n\n=== Denormalized numbers ===\n\nThe number representations described above are called ''normalized,'' meaning that the implicit leading binary digit is a 1. To reduce the loss of precision when an [[Arithmetic underflow|underflow]] occurs, IEEE&nbsp;754 includes the ability to represent fractions smaller than are possible in the normalized representation, by making the implicit leading digit a 0. Such numbers are called [[denormal numbers|denormal]]. They don't include as many [[significant digits]] as a normalized number, but they enable a gradual loss of precision when the result of an [[Floating-point arithmetic#Floating-point arithmetic operations|arithmetic operation]] is not exactly zero but is too close to zero to be represented by a normalized number.\n\nA denormal number is represented with a biased exponent of all 0 bits, which represents an exponent of \u2212126 in single precision (not \u2212127), or \u22121022 in double precision (not \u22121023).<ref>{{cite book|last=Hennessy|title=Computer Organization and Design|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|page=270}}</ref> In contrast, the smallest biased exponent representing a normal number is 1 (see [[#Examples|examples]] below).\n\n== Representation of non-numbers ==\n\nThe biased-exponent field is filled with all 1 bits to indicate either infinity or an invalid result of a computation.\n\n=== Positive and negative infinity ===\n\n[[Extended real line|Positive and negative infinity]] are represented thus:\n\n: ''sign'' = 0 for positive infinity, 1 for negative infinity.\n: ''biased exponent'' = all 1 bits.\n: ''fraction'' = all 0 bits.\n\n=== NaN ===\n\nSome operations of [[Floating-point arithmetic#Floating-point arithmetic operations|floating-point arithmetic]] are invalid, such as taking the square root of a negative number. The act of reaching an invalid result is called a floating-point ''exception.'' An exceptional result is represented by a special code called a NaN, for \"[[Not a Number]]\". All NaNs in IEEE&nbsp;754-1985 have this format:\n\n: ''sign'' = either 0 or 1.\n: ''biased exponent'' = all 1 bits.\n: ''fraction'' = anything except all 0 bits (since all 0 bits represents infinity).\n\n== Range and precision ==\n[[File:IEEE 754 relative precision.svg|thumb|Relative precision of single (binary32) and double precision (binary64) numbers, compared with decimal representations using a fixed number of [[significant digits]].

The [[x87]] [[extended precision|80-bit extended format]] is the most commonly implemented extended format that meets these requirements.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nHere are some examples of single-precision IEEE 754 representations:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The [[#Representation_of_numbers|binary representation]] has the special property that, excluding NaNs, any two numbers can be compared as [[sign and magnitude]] integers ([[endianness]] issues apply).  When comparing as [[2's-complement]] integers:  If the sign bits differ, the negative number precedes the positive number, so 2's complement gives the correct result (except that negative zero and positive zero should be considered equal).  If both values are positive, the 2's complement comparison again gives the correct result.  Otherwise (two negative numbers), the correct FP ordering is the opposite of the 2's complement ordering.\n\nRounding errors inherent in floating point calculations often make comparison of results for exact equality not useful.  Choosing an acceptable range is a complex topic.\n\nAlthough negative zero and positive zero are generally considered equal for comparison purposes, some [[programming language]] [[relational operator]]s and similar constructs might or do treat them as distinct. According to the [[Java (programming language)|Java]] Language Specification,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/|title=Java Language and Virtual Machine Specifications|website=Java Documentation}}</ref> comparison and equality operators treat them as equal, but <code>Math.min()</code> and <code>Math.max()</code> distinguish them (officially starting with Java version 1.1 but actually with 1.1.1), as do the comparison methods <code>equals()</code>, <code>compareTo()</code> and even <code>compare()</code> of classes <code>Float</code> and <code>Double</code>.\n\n==Rounding floating-point numbers==\nThe IEEE standard has four different rounding modes; the first is the default; the others are called ''[[directed rounding]]s''.\n\n* '''Round to Nearest''' &ndash; rounds to the nearest value; if the number falls midway it is rounded to the nearest value with an even (zero) least significant bit, which means it is rounded up 50% of the time (in [[IEEE 754-2008]] this mode is called ''roundTiesToEven'' to distinguish it from another round-to-nearest mode)\n* '''Round toward 0''' &ndash; directed rounding towards zero\n* '''Round toward +\u221e''' &ndash; directed rounding towards positive infinity\n* '''Round toward \u2212\u221e''' &ndash; directed rounding towards negative infinity.\n\n==Extending the real numbers==\nThe IEEE standard employs (and extends) the [[affinely extended real number system]], with separate positive and negative infinities. During drafting, there was a proposal for the standard to incorporate the [[projectively extended real number system]], with a single unsigned infinity, by providing programmers with a mode selection option. In the interest of reducing the complexity of the final standard, the projective mode was dropped, however. The [[Intel 8087]] and [[Intel 80287]] [[floating point]] [[co-processor]]s both support this projective mode.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems|volume=18|issue=2|date=March 1996|format=PDF|url=http://www.jhauser.us/publications/1996_Hauser_FloatingPointExceptions.html|author=John R.

This is not like a normal [[modulo operation]], it can be negative for two positive numbers. It returns the exact value of {{math|x\u2013(round(x/y)\u00b7y)}}.\n*[[rounding to integer|Round to nearest integer]]. For undirected rounding when halfway between two integers the even integer is chosen.\n*Comparison operations. Besides the more obvious results, IEEE&nbsp;754 defines that \u2212\u221e&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u2212\u221e, +\u221e&nbsp;=&nbsp;+\u221e and <var>x</var>&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;<code>NaN</code> for any <var>x</var> (including <code>NaN</code>).\n\n===Recommended functions and predicates===\n* <code>copysign(x,y)</code> returns x with the sign of y, so <code>abs(x)</code> equals <code>copysign(x,1.0)</code>. This is one of the few operations which operates on a NaN in a way resembling arithmetic. The function <code>copysign</code> is new in the C99 standard.\n* &minus;x returns x with the sign reversed. This is different from 0&minus;x in some cases, notably when x is 0. So &minus;(0) is &minus;0, but the sign of 0&minus;0 depends on the rounding mode.\n* <code>scalb(y, N)</code>\n* <code>logb(x)</code>\n* <code>finite(x)</code> a [[Predicate (mathematics)|predicate]] for \"x is a finite value\", equivalent to &minus;Inf < x < Inf\n* <code>isnan(x)</code> a predicate for \"x is a NaN\", equivalent to \"x \u2260 x\"\n* <code>x <> y</code> which turns out to have different exception behavior than NOT(x = y).\n* <code>unordered(x, y)</code> is true when \"x is unordered with y\", i.e., either x or y is a NaN.\n* <code>class(x)</code>\n* <code>nextafter(x,y)</code> returns the next representable value from x in the direction towards y\n\n=={{anchor|P754}}History==\nIn 1976 [[Intel]] began planning to produce a floating point coprocessor. John Palmer, the manager of the effort, persuaded them that they should try to develop a standard for all their floating point operations. [[William Kahan]] was hired as a consultant; he had helped improve the accuracy of [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s calculators.  Kahan initially recommended that the floating point base be decimal<ref>W. Kahan 2003, pers. comm. to [[Mike Cowlishaw]] and others after an IEEE 754 meeting{{rs|date=October 2016}}</ref> but the hardware design of the coprocessor was too far along to make that change.\n\nThe work within Intel worried other vendors, who set up a standardization effort to ensure a 'level playing field'. Kahan attended the second IEEE 754 standards working group meeting, held in November 1977. Here, he received permission from Intel to put forward a draft proposal based on the standard arithmetic part of their design for a coprocessor. The arguments over [[gradual underflow]] lasted until 1981 when an expert hired by [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] to assess it sided against the dissenters.\n\nEven before it was approved, the draft standard had been implemented by a number of manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/754story.html|title=An Interview with the Old Man of Floating-Point| author=Charles Severance |author-link=Charles Severance |date=20 February 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|publisher=Connexions |url=http://cnx.org/content/m32770/latest/ |title=History of IEEE Floating-Point Format|author=Charles Severance |author-link=Charles Severance}}</ref> The [[Intel 8087]], which was announced in 1980, was the first chip to implement the draft standard.\n\n==See also==\n* [[&minus;0 (number)|&minus;0]] (negative zero)\n* [[Intel 8087]]\n* [[minifloat]] for simple examples of properties of IEEE 754 floating point numbers\n* [[Fixed-point arithmetic]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*{{cite journal\n |     author = Charles Severance |author-link=Charles Severance\n |      title = IEEE 754: An Interview with William Kahan\n |    journal = [[IEEE Computer]]\n |date=March 1998\n |     volume = 31\n |      issue = 3\n |      pages = 114\u2013115\n |        doi = 10.1109/MC.1998.660194\n |        url = http://www.freecollab.com/dr-chuck/papers/columns/r3114.pdf\n | accessdate = 2008-04-28\n |     format = PDF\n |      quote =  \n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |     author = David Goldberg\n |      title = What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic\n |    journal = [[ACM Computing Surveys]]\n |date=March 1991\n |     volume = 23\n |      issue = 1\n |      pages = 5\u201348\n |        doi = 10.1145/103162.103163\n |        url = http://www.validlab.com/goldberg/paper.pdf\n | accessdate = 2008-04-28\n |     format = PDF\n |      quote =  \n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |     author = Chris Hecker\n |      title = Let's Get To The (Floating) Point\n |    journal = Game Developer Magazine\n |date=February 1996\n |      pages = 19\u201324\n |       issn = 1073-922X\n |        url = http://www.d6.com/users/checker/pdfs/gdmfp.pdf\n |format=PDF| accessdate = \n |      quote =  \n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |     author = David Monniaux\n |      title = The pitfalls of verifying floating-point computations\n |    journal = [[ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]]\n |date=May 2008\n |      pages = article #12\n |     volume = 30\n |      issue = 3\n |        doi = 10.1145/1353445.1353446\n |       issn = 0164-0925\n |        url = http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00128124/en/|arxiv = cs/0701192\n }}: A compendium of non-intuitive behaviours of floating-point on popular architectures, with implications for program verification and testing.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.cygnus-software.com/papers/comparingfloats/Obsolete%20comparing%20floating%20point%20numbers.htm Comparing floats]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070314154031/http://www.coprocessor.info/ Coprocessor.info: x87 FPU pictures, development and manufacturer information]\n* [http://speleotrove.com/decimal/854mins.html IEEE 854-1987] &mdash; History and minutes\n* [http://www.binaryconvert.com/convert_float.html IEEE754 (Single and Double precision) Online Converter]\n\n{{IEEE standards}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ieee 754-1985}}\n[[Category:Computer arithmetic]]\n[[Category:IEEE standards]]\n[[Category:Floating point]]", "sha1": "cj9pvmbhff8o7urn84n8ca81xdv3dnk"}}]
