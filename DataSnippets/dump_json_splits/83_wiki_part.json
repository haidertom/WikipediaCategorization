HTML describes the structure of a web page [[Semantic Web|semantically]] and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\n\n[[HTML element]]s are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]] and other objects such as [[Fieldset|interactive forms]] may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [[structured document]]s by denoting structural [[semantics]] for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [[Hyperlink|links]], quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by ''tags'', written using [[Bracket#Angle brackets|angle brackets]]. Tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<img />}} and {{code|lang=html|<input />}} directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\n\nHTML can embed programs written in a [[scripting language]] such as [[JavaScript]], which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML {{as of|1997|lc=y|since=y|post=.}}<ref name=\"deprecated\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/conform.html#deprecated|title=HTML 4.0 Specification \u2014 W3C Recommendation \u2014 Conformance: requirements and recommendations|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Development===\n[[File:Tim Berners-Lee April 2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Photograph of Tim Berners-Lee in April 2009|[[Tim Berners-Lee]] in April 2009]]\n\nIn 1980, physicist [[Tim Berners-Lee]], a contractor at [[CERN]], proposed and prototyped [[ENQUIRE]], a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an [[Internet]]-based [[hypertext]] system.<ref>Tim Berners-Lee, \"Information Management: A Proposal.\" CERN (March 1989, May 1990). [https://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html W3.org]</ref> Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer [[Robert Cailliau]] collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes<ref>Tim Berners-Lee, [https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/ \"Design Issues\"]</ref> from 1990 he listed<ref>Tim Berners-Lee, [https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Uses.html \"Design Issues\"]</ref> \"some of the many areas in which hypertext is used\" and put an encyclopedia first.\n\nThe first publicly available description of HTML was a document called \"HTML Tags\", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.<ref name=\"tagshtml\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991SepOct/0003.html|title=First mention of HTML Tags on the www-talk mailing list|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=October 29, 1991|accessdate=April 8, 2007}}</ref> It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by [[SGMLguid]], an in-house [[Standard Generalized Markup Language]] (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/index/elements|title=Index of elements in HTML 4|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 24, 1999|accessdate=April 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHTML is a [[markup language]] that [[web browser]]s use to interpret and [[Typesetting|compose]] text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]]. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 ''Techniques for using SGML'', which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the [[TYPSET and RUNOFF|RUNOFF command]] developed in the early 1960s for the [[Compatible Time-Sharing System|CTSS]] (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.\n\nBerners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the \"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)\" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee and [[Dan Connolly (computer scientist)|Dan Connolly]], which included an SGML [[Document type definition]] to define the grammar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-talk/1991NovDec/0020.html|title=Re: SGML/HTML docs, X Browser (archived www-talk mailing list post)|author=Tim Berners-Lee|date=December 9, 1991|accessdate=June 16, 2007|quote=SGML is very general.

HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like {{code|lang=html|code=<h1>}} and {{code|lang=html|code=</h1>}}, although some represent ''empty elements'' and so are unpaired, for example {{code|lang=html|code=<img>}}. The first tag in such a pair is the ''start tag'', and the second is the ''end tag'' (they are also called ''opening tags'' and ''closing tags'').\n\nAnother important component is the HTML ''[[document type declaration]]'', which triggers [[standards mode]] rendering.\n\nThe following is an example of the classic [[\"Hello, World!\" program]]:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>This is a title</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>Hello world!</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThe text between {{code|lang=html|code=<html>}} and {{code|lang=html|code=</html>}} describes the web page, and the text between {{code|lang=html|code=<body>}} and {{code|lang=html|code=</body>}} is the visible page content. The markup text {{code|lang=html|code=<title>This is a title</title>}} defines the browser page title.\n\nThe Document Type Declaration {{code|lang=html|code=<!DOCTYPE html>}} is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to \"[[quirks mode]]\" for rendering.<ref name=\"hsivonen\">[http://hsivonen.iki.fi/doctype/ Activating Browser Modes with Doctype]. Hsivonen.iki.fi. Retrieved on 2012-02-16.</ref>\n\n===Elements===\n{{Main|HTML element}}\nHTML documents imply a structure of nested [[HTML element]]s. These are indicated in the document by HTML ''tags'', enclosed in angle brackets thus: {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=HTML Elements|url=https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp|publisher=w3schools|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the simple, general case, the extent of an element is indicated by a pair of tags: a \"start tag\" {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} and \"end tag\" {{code|lang=html|code=</p>}}. The text content of the element, if any, is placed between these tags.\n\nTags may also enclose further tag markup between the start and end, including a mixture of tags and text. This indicates further (nested) elements, as children of the parent element.\n\nThe start tag may also include ''attributes'' within the tag. These indicate other information, such as identifiers for sections within the document, identifiers used to bind style information to the presentation of the document, and for some tags such as the {{code|lang=html|code=<img>}} used to embed images, the reference to the image resource.\n\nSome elements, such as the [[line breaking character|line break]] {{code|lang=html|code=<br>}}, do not permit ''any'' embedded content, either text or further tags. These require only a single empty tag (akin to a start tag) and do not use an end tag.\n\nMany tags, particularly the closing end tag for the very commonly used paragraph element {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}}, are optional. An HTML browser or other agent can infer the closure for the end of an element from the context and the structural rules defined by the HTML standard. These rules are complex and not widely understood by most HTML coders.\n\nThe general form of an HTML element is therefore: {{code|lang=html|code=<tag attribute1=\"value1\" attribute2=\"value2\">''content''</tag>}}. Some HTML elements are defined as ''empty elements'' and take the form {{code|lang=html|code=<tag attribute1=\"value1\" attribute2=\"value2\">}}. Empty elements may enclose no content, for instance, the {{code|lang=html|code=<br>}} tag or the inline {{code|lang=html|code=<img>}} tag.\nThe name of an HTML element is the name used in the tags.\nNote that the end tag's name is preceded by a slash character, <code>&#47;</code>, and that in empty elements the end tag is neither required nor allowed.\nIf attributes are not mentioned, default values are used in each case.\n\n====Element examples====\nHeader of the HTML document: {{code|lang=html|code=<head>...</head>}}. The title is included in the head, for example:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\">\n<head>\n  <title>The Title</title>\n</head>\n</syntaxhighlight>\nHeadings: HTML headings are defined with the {{code|lang=html|code=<h1>}} to {{code|lang=html|code=<h6>}} tags:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\">\n<h1>Heading level 1</h1>\n<h2>Heading level 2</h2>\n<h3>Heading level 3</h3>\n<h4>Heading level 4</h4>\n<h5>Heading level 5</h5>\n<h6>Heading level 6</h6>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nParagraphs:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\"><p>Paragraph 1</p> <p>Paragraph 2</p></syntaxhighlight>\nLine breaks: {{code|lang=html|code=<br>}}. The difference between {{code|lang=html|code=<br>}} and {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} is that <code>br</code> [[line breaking character|breaks a line]] without altering the semantic structure of the page, whereas <code>p</code> sections the page into [[paragraph]]s. Note also that <code>br</code> is an ''empty element'' in that, although it may have attributes, it can take no content and it may not have an end tag.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\"><p>This <br> is a paragraph <br> with <br> line breaks</p></syntaxhighlight>\nThis is a link in HTML. To create a link the {{code|lang=html|code=<a>}} tag is used. The <code>href</code> attribute holds the URL address of the link.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\"><a href=\"https://www.wikipedia.org/\">A link to Wikipedia!</a></syntaxhighlight>\nInputs:\nThere are many possible ways a user can give input/s like:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html\" line=\"1\">\n<input type=\"text\" /> <!-- This is for text input -->\n<input type=\"file\" /> <!-- This is for uploading files -->\n<input type=\"checkbox\" /> <!-- This is for checkboxes -->\n</syntaxhighlight>\n{{Anchor|Comments|comments}}Comments:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\"><!-- This is a comment --></syntaxhighlight> Comments can help in the understanding of the markup and do not display in the webpage.\n\nThere are several types of markup elements used in HTML:\n;Structural markup indicates the purpose of text: For example, {{code|lang=html|code=<h2>Golf</h2>}} establishes \"Golf\" as a second-level [[HTML element#Basic text|heading]]. Structural markup does not denote any specific rendering, but most web browsers have default styles for element formatting. Content may be further styled using [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS).<ref>{{cite web|title=CSS Introduction|url=https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp|publisher=W3schools|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref>\n;Presentational markup indicates the appearance of the text, regardless of its purpose: For example, {{code|lang=html|code=<b>boldface</b>}} indicates that visual output devices should render \"boldface\" in bold text, but gives little indication what devices that are unable to do this (such as aural devices that read the text aloud) should do. In the case of both {{code|lang=html|code=<b>bold</b>}} and {{code|lang=html|code=<i>italic</i>}}, there are other elements that may have equivalent visual renderings but that are more semantic in nature, such as {{code|lang=html|code=<strong>strong text</strong>}} and {{code|lang=html|code=<em>emphasized text</em>}} respectively. It is easier to see how an aural user agent should interpret the latter two elements. However, they are not equivalent to their presentational counterparts: it would be undesirable for a screen-reader to emphasize the name of a book, for instance, but on a screen such a name would be italicized. Most presentational markup elements have become [[Deprecation|deprecated]] under the HTML 4.0 specification in favor of using [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] for styling.\n;Hypertext markup makes parts of a document into links to other documents: An anchor element creates a [[hyperlink]] in the document and its <code>href</code> attribute sets the link's target [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]. For example, the HTML markup {{code|lang=html|code=<a href=\"https://www.google.com/\">Wikipedia</a>}}, will render the word \"<span class=\"plainlinks\">[https://www.google.com/ Wikipedia]</span>\" as a hyperlink. To render an image as a hyperlink, an <code>img</code> element is inserted as content into the <code>a</code> element. Like <code>br</code>, <code>img</code> is an empty element with attributes but no content or closing tag. {{code|lang=html|code=<a href=\"https://example.org\"><img src=\"image.gif\" alt=\"descriptive text\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" border=\"0\"></a>}}.\n\n====Attributes====\n{{main|HTML attribute}}\nMost of the attributes of an element are [[Attribute-value pair|name-value pairs]], separated by <code>&#61;</code> and written within the start tag of an element after the element's name. The value may be enclosed in single or double quotes, although values consisting of certain characters can be left unquoted in HTML (but not XHTML).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/html401/intro/sgmltut.html#h-3.2.2|title=On SGML and HTML|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/diffs.html#h-4.4|title=XHTML 1.0 \u2013 Differences with HTML&#160;4|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref> Leaving attribute values unquoted is considered unsafe.<ref>{{cite web|first=Jukka|last=Korpela|url=http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/qattr.html|title=Why attribute values should always be quoted in HTML|publisher=Cs.tut.fi|date=July 6, 1998|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref> In contrast with name-value pair attributes, there are some attributes that affect the element simply by their presence in the start tag of the element,<ref name=\"tagshtml\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html|title=Tags used in HTML|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=November 3, 1992|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref> like the <code>ismap</code> attribute for the <code>img</code> element.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/struct/objects.html#adef-ismap|title=Objects, Images, and Applets in HTML documents|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 24, 1999|accessdate=November 16, 2008}}</ref>\n\nThere are several common attributes that may appear in many elements :\n\n* The <code>id</code> attribute provides a document-wide unique identifier for an element. This is used to identify the element so that stylesheets can alter its presentational properties, and scripts may alter, animate or delete its contents or presentation. Appended to the URL of the page, it provides a globally unique identifier for the element, typically a sub-section of the page. For example, the ID \"Attributes\" in <code><nowiki>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#Attributes</nowiki></code>.\n* The <code>class</code> attribute provides a way of classifying similar elements. This can be used for [[semantics|semantic]] or presentation purposes. For example, an HTML document might semantically use the designation {{code|lang=html|code=<class=\"notation\">}} to indicate that all elements with this class value are subordinate to the main text of the document. In presentation<!-- Presentationally is not a formally accepted word -->, such elements might be gathered together and presented as footnotes on a page instead of appearing in the place where they occur in the HTML source. Class attributes are used semantically in [[microformat]]s. Multiple class values may be specified; for example {{code|lang=html|code=<class=\"notation important\">}} puts the element into both the <code>notation</code> and the <code>important</code> classes.\n* An author may use the <code>style</code> attribute to assign presentational properties to a particular element. It is considered better practice to use an element's <code>id</code> or <code>class</code> attributes to select the element from within a [[Cascading Style Sheets|stylesheet]], though sometimes this can be too cumbersome for a simple, specific, or ad hoc styling.\n* The <code>title</code> attribute is used to attach subtextual explanation to an element. In most [[Web browser|browsers]] this attribute is displayed as a [[tooltip]].\n* The <code>lang</code> attribute identifies the natural language of the element's contents, which may be different from that of the rest of the document. For example, in an English-language document: <syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\"><p>Oh well, <span lang=\"fr\">c'est la vie</span>, as they say in France.</p></syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe abbreviation element, <code>abbr</code>, can be used to demonstrate some of these attributes:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\"><abbr id=\"anId\" class=\"jargon\" style=\"color:purple;\" title=\"Hypertext Markup Language\">HTML</abbr></syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis example displays as <abbr id=\"anId\" class=\"jargon\" style=\"color:purple;\" title=\"Hypertext Markup Language\">HTML</abbr>; in most browsers, pointing the cursor at the abbreviation should display the title text \"Hypertext Markup Language.\"\n\nMost elements take the language-related attribute <code>dir</code> to specify text direction, such as with \"rtl\" for right-to-left text in, for example, [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref>{{cite web|title=H56: Using the dir attribute on an inline element to resolve problems with nested directional runs|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG-TECHS/H56.html|work=Techniques for WCAG 2.0|publisher=W3C|accessdate=18 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Character and entity references===\n{{See also|List of XML and HTML character entity references|Unicode and HTML}}\n\nAs of version 4.0, HTML defines a set of 252 [[character entity reference]]s and a set of 1,114,050 [[numeric character reference]]s, both of which allow individual characters to be written via simple markup, rather than literally. A literal character and its markup counterpart are considered equivalent and are rendered identically.\n\nThe ability to \"escape\" characters in this way allows for the characters <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code> (when written as <code>&amp;lt;</code> and <code>&amp;amp;</code>, respectively) to be interpreted as character data, rather than markup. For example, a literal <code>&lt;</code> normally indicates the start of a tag, and <code>&amp;</code> normally indicates the start of a character entity reference or numeric character reference; writing it as <code>&amp;amp;</code> or <code>&amp;#x26;</code> or <code>&amp;#38;</code> allows <code>&amp;</code> to be included in the content of an element or in the value of an attribute. The double-quote character (<code>\"</code>), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as <code>&amp;quot;</code> or <code>&amp;#x22;</code> or <code>&amp;#34;</code> when it appears within the attribute value itself. Equivalently, the single-quote character (<code>'</code>), when not used to quote an attribute value, must also be escaped as <code>&amp;#x27;</code> or <code>&amp;#39;</code> (or as <code>&amp;apos;</code> in HTML5 or XHTML documents<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dev.w3.org/html5/html-author/charref|title=Character Entity Reference Chart|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=October 24, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"aposhtml\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_16|title=The Named Character Reference &amp;apos;|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=January 26, 2000}}</ref>) when it appears within the attribute value itself. If document authors overlook the need to escape such characters, some browsers can be very forgiving and try to use context to guess their intent. The result is still invalid markup, which makes the document less accessible to other browsers and to other [[user agent]]s that may try to parse the document for [[Web crawler|search and indexing]] purposes for example.\n\nEscaping also allows for characters that are not easily typed, or that are not available in the document's [[character encoding]], to be represented within element and attribute content. For example, the acute-accented <code>e</code> (<code>\u00e9</code>), a character typically found only on Western European and South American keyboards, can be written in any HTML document as the entity reference <code>&amp;eacute;</code> or as the numeric references <code>&amp;#xE9;</code> or <code>&amp;#233;</code>, using characters that are available on all keyboards and are supported in all character encodings. [[Unicode]] character encodings such as [[UTF-8]] are compatible with all modern browsers and allow direct access to almost all the characters of the world's writing systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Unicode Standard: A Technical Introduction|url=https://www.unicode.org/standard/principles.html#|accessdate=2010-03-16}}</ref>\n\n===Data types===\nHTML defines several [[data type]]s for element content, such as script data and stylesheet data, and a plethora of types for attribute values, including IDs, names, URIs, numbers, units of length, languages, media descriptors, colors, character encodings, dates and times, and so on. All of these data types are specializations of character data.\n\n===Document type declaration===\nHTML documents are required to start with a [[Document Type Declaration]] (informally, a \"doctype\"). In browsers, the doctype helps to define the rendering mode\u2014particularly whether to use [[quirks mode]].\n\nThe original purpose of the doctype was to enable parsing and validation of HTML documents by SGML tools based on the [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD). The DTD to which the DOCTYPE refers contains a machine-readable grammar specifying the permitted and prohibited content for a document conforming to such a DTD. Browsers, on the other hand, do not implement HTML as an application of SGML and by consequence do not read the DTD.\n\n[[HTML5]] does not define a DTD; therefore, in HTML5 the doctype declaration is simpler and shorter:<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/html/syntax.html#doctype-syntax \"HTML: The Markup Language (an HTML language reference)\"]. Retrieved 2013-08-19.</ref>\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html5\">\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nAn example of an HTML 4 doctype\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"html4strict\">\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\">\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThis declaration references the DTD for the \"strict\" version of HTML 4.01. SGML-based validators read the DTD in order to properly parse the document and to perform validation. In modern browsers, a valid doctype activates standards mode as opposed to [[quirks mode]].\n\nIn addition, HTML 4.01 provides Transitional and Frameset DTDs, [[#Transitional versus strict|as explained below]]. Transitional type is the most inclusive, incorporating current tags as well as older or \"deprecated\" tags, with the Strict DTD excluding deprecated tags. Frameset has all tags necessary to make frames on a page along with the tags included in transitional type.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Semantic HTML==\n{{Main|Semantic HTML}}\nSemantic HTML is a way of writing HTML that emphasizes the meaning of the encoded information over its presentation (look). HTML has included semantic markup from its inception,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Berners-Lee|first1=Tim|last2=Fischetti|first2=Mark|title=Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by Its Inventor|isbn=978-0-06-251587-2|publisher=Harper|location=San Francisco|year=2000}}</ref> but has also included presentational markup, such as {{code|lang=html|code=<font>}}, {{code|lang=html|code=<i>}} and {{code|lang=html|code=<center>}} tags. There are also the semantically neutral [[span and div]] tags. Since the late 1990s, when [[Cascading Style Sheets]] were beginning to work in most browsers, web authors have been encouraged to avoid the use of presentational HTML markup with a view to the [[separation of presentation and content]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style.html|title=Adding a touch of style|last=Raggett|first=Dave|year=2002|publisher=W3C|accessdate=October 2, 2009}} This article notes that presentational HTML markup may be useful when targeting browsers \"before Netscape 4.0 and Internet Explorer 4.0\". See the [[list of web browsers]] to confirm that these were both released in 1997.</ref>\n\nIn a 2001 discussion of the [[Semantic Web]], [[Tim Berners-Lee]] and others gave examples of ways in which intelligent software \"agents\" may one day automatically crawl the web and find, filter and correlate previously unrelated, published facts for the benefit of human users.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-semantic-web|title=The Semantic Web|author=Tim Berners-Lee, James Hendler and Ora Lassila|publisher=Scientific American|year=2001|accessdate=October 2, 2009}}</ref> Such agents are not commonplace even now, but some of the ideas of [[Web 2.0]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]] and [[Price comparison service|price comparison websites]] may be coming close. The main difference between these web application hybrids and Berners-Lee's semantic agents lies in the fact that the current [[Feed aggregator|aggregation]] and hybridization of information is usually designed in by [[web developer]]s, who already know the web locations and the [[Application programming interface|API semantics]] of the specific data they wish to mash, compare and combine.\n\nAn important type of web agent that does crawl and read web pages automatically, without prior knowledge of what it might find, is the [[web crawler]] or search-engine spider. These software agents are dependent on the semantic clarity of web pages they find as they use various techniques and [[algorithm]]s to read and index millions of web pages a day and provide web users with [[Web search engine|search facilities]] without which the World Wide Web's usefulness would be greatly reduced.\n\nIn order for search-engine spiders to be able to rate the significance of pieces of text they find in HTML documents, and also for those creating mashups and other hybrids as well as for more automated agents as they are developed, the semantic structures that exist in HTML need to be widely and uniformly applied to bring out the meaning of published text.<ref name=\"Semantic_Web_Revisted\">{{cite web|url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/12614/1/Semantic_Web_Revisted.pdf|title=The Semantic Web Revisited|author=Nigel Shadbolt, Wendy Hall and Tim Berners-Lee|publisher=IEEE Intelligent Systems|year=2006|accessdate=October 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\nPresentational markup tags are [[Deprecation|deprecated]] in current HTML and [[XHTML]] recommendations. The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed as they lead to poorer accessibility, higher cost of site maintenance, and larger document sizes <ref>{{cite web |title=HTML: The Living Standard |url=https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/introduction.html#restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values |website=WHATWG |accessdate=27 September 2018}}</ref>. \n\nGood semantic HTML also improves the [[accessibility]] of web documents (see also [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]]). For example, when a screen reader or audio browser can correctly ascertain the structure of a document, it will not waste the visually impaired user's time by reading out repeated or irrelevant information when it has been marked up correctly.\n\n==Delivery==\nHTML documents can be delivered by the same means as any other computer file. However, they are most often delivered either by [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] from a [[web server]] or by [[email]].\n\n===HTTP===\n{{Main|Hypertext Transfer Protocol}}\nThe [[World Wide Web]] is composed primarily of HTML documents transmitted from web servers to web browsers using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP). However, HTTP is used to serve images, sound, and other content, in addition to HTML. To allow the web browser to know how to handle each document it receives, other information is transmitted along with the document. This [[meta data]] usually includes the [[MIME type]] (e.g., <kbd>text/html</kbd> or <kbd>application/xhtml+xml</kbd>) and the character encoding (see [[Character encoding in HTML]]).\n\nIn modern browsers, the MIME type that is sent with the HTML document may affect how the document is initially interpreted. A document sent with the XHTML MIME type is expected to be [[XML#Well-formed documents|well-formed]] XML; syntax errors may cause the browser to fail to render it. The same document sent with the HTML MIME type might be displayed successfully, since some browsers are more lenient with HTML.\n\nThe W3C recommendations state that XHTML 1.0 documents that follow guidelines set forth in the recommendation's Appendix C may be labeled with either MIME Type.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#media|title=XHTML 1.0 The Extensible HyperText Markup Language (Second Edition)|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|origyear=2000|year=2002|accessdate=December 7, 2008|quote=XHTML Documents which follow the guidelines set forth in Appendix C, \"HTML Compatibility Guidelines\" may be labeled with the Internet Media Type \"text/html\" [RFC2854], as they are compatible with most HTML browsers.

This may include typographic information like coloured headings, emphasized and quoted text, inline images and diagrams. Many such clients include both a [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] editor for composing HTML e-mail messages and a rendering engine for displaying them. Use of HTML in e-mail is criticized by some because of compatibility issues, because it can help disguise [[phishing]] attacks, because of accessibility issues for blind or visually impaired people, because it can confuse [[Email spam|spam]] filters and because the message size is larger than plain text.\n\n===Naming conventions===\nThe most common [[filename extension]] for [[computer file|files]] containing HTML is <kbd>.html</kbd>. A common abbreviation of this is <kbd>.htm</kbd>, which originated because some early operating systems and file systems, such as [[DOS]] and the limitations imposed by [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] data structure, limited file extensions to [[8.3 filename|three letters]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces|url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=16 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===HTML Application===\n{{Main|HTML Application}}\nAn HTML Application (HTA; file extension \".hta\") is a [[Microsoft Windows]] application that uses HTML and Dynamic HTML in a [[Web browser|browser]] to provide the application's graphical interface. A regular HTML file is confined to the security model of the [[Browser security|web browser's security]], communicating only to web servers and manipulating only webpage objects and [[HTTP cookie|site cookies]]. An HTA runs as a fully trusted application and therefore has more privileges, like creation/editing/removal of files and [[Windows Registry]] entries. Because they operate outside the browser's security model, HTAs cannot be executed via HTTP, but must be downloaded (just like an [[EXE|EXE file]]) and executed from local file system.\n\n==HTML4 variations==\nSince its inception, HTML and its associated protocols gained acceptance relatively quickly.{{By whom|date=March 2017}} However, no clear standards existed in the early years of the language. Though its creators originally conceived of HTML as a semantic language devoid of presentation details,<ref>[https://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/HTMLConstraints.html HTML Design Constraints], W3C Archives</ref> practical uses pushed many presentational elements and attributes into the language, driven largely by the various browser vendors. The latest standards surrounding HTML reflect efforts to overcome the sometimes chaotic development of the language<ref>[http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~wwwbtb/book/chap13/who.html WWW:BTB \u2013 HTML], Pris Sears</ref> and to create a rational foundation for building both meaningful and well-presented documents. To return HTML to its role as a semantic language, the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] has developed style languages such as [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[XSL]] to shoulder the burden of presentation. In conjunction, the HTML specification has slowly reined in the presentational elements.\n\nThere are two axes differentiating various variations of HTML as currently specified: SGML-based HTML versus XML-based HTML (referred to as XHTML) on one axis, and strict versus transitional (loose) versus frameset on the other axis.\n\n===SGML-based versus XML-based HTML===\nOne difference in the latest HTML specifications lies in the distinction between the SGML-based specification and the XML-based specification. The XML-based specification is usually called [[XHTML]] to distinguish it clearly from the more traditional definition. However, the root element name continues to be \"html\" even in the XHTML-specified HTML. The W3C intended XHTML 1.0 to be identical to HTML 4.01 except where limitations of XML over the more complex SGML require workarounds. Because XHTML and HTML are closely related, they are sometimes documented in parallel. In such circumstances, some authors [[(X)HTML|conflate the two names]] as (X)HTML or X(HTML).\n\nLike HTML 4.01, XHTML 1.0 has three sub-specifications: strict, transitional and frameset.\n\nAside from the different opening declarations for a document, the differences between an HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 document\u2014in each of the corresponding DTDs\u2014are largely syntactic. The underlying syntax of HTML allows many shortcuts that XHTML does not, such as elements with optional opening or closing tags, and even empty elements which must not have an end tag. By contrast, XHTML requires all elements to have an opening tag and a closing tag. XHTML, however, also introduces a new shortcut: an XHTML tag may be opened and closed within the same tag, by including a slash before the end of the tag like this: {{code|lang=html|code=<br/>}}. The introduction of this shorthand, which is not used in the SGML declaration for HTML 4.01, may confuse earlier software unfamiliar with this new convention. A fix for this is to include a space before closing the tag, as such: {{code|lang=html|code=<br />}}.<ref>Freeman, E (2005). Head First HTML. O'Reilly.</ref>\n\nTo understand the subtle differences between HTML and XHTML, consider the transformation of a valid and well-formed XHTML 1.0 document that adheres to Appendix C (see below) into a valid HTML 4.01 document. To make this translation requires the following steps:\n# '''The language for an element should be specified with a <code>lang</code> attribute rather than the XHTML <code>xml:lang</code> attribute.''' XHTML uses XML's built in language-defining functionality attribute.\n# '''Remove the XML namespace (<code>xmlns=URI</code>).''' HTML has no facilities for namespaces.\n# '''Change the document type declaration''' from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. (see [[#Document type declaration|DTD section]] for further explanation).\n# If present, '''remove the XML declaration.''' (Typically this is: {{code|lang=xml|code=<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>}}).\n# '''Ensure that the document's MIME type is set to <code>text/html</code>.''' For both HTML and XHTML, this comes from the HTTP <code>Content-Type</code> header sent by the server.\n# '''Change the XML empty-element syntax to an HTML style empty element''' ({{code|lang=html|code=<br />}} to {{code|lang=html|code=<br>}}).\n\nThose are the main changes necessary to translate a document from XHTML 1.0 to HTML 4.01. To translate from HTML to XHTML would also require the addition of any omitted opening or closing tags. Whether coding in HTML or XHTML it may just be best to always include the optional tags within an HTML document rather than remembering which tags can be omitted.\n\nA well-formed XHTML document adheres to all the syntax requirements of XML. A valid document adheres to the content specification for XHTML, which describes the document structure.\n\nThe W3C recommends several conventions to ensure an easy migration between HTML and XHTML (see [https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines HTML Compatibility Guidelines]). The following steps can be applied to XHTML 1.0 documents only:\n* Include both <code>xml:lang</code> and <code>lang</code> attributes on any elements assigning language.\n* Use the empty-element syntax only for elements specified as empty in HTML.\n* Include an extra space in empty-element tags: for example {{code|lang=html|code=<br />}} instead of {{code|lang=html|code=<br>}}.\n* Include explicit close tags for elements that permit content but are left empty (for example, {{code|lang=html|code=<div></div>}}, not {{code|lang=html|code=<div />}}).\n* Omit the XML declaration.\n\nBy carefully following the W3C's compatibility guidelines, a user agent should be able to interpret the document equally as HTML or XHTML. For documents that are XHTML 1.0 and have been made compatible in this way, the W3C permits them to be served either as HTML (with a <code>text/html</code> [[MIME type]]), or as XHTML (with an <code>application/xhtml+xml</code> or <code>application/xml</code> MIME type). When delivered as XHTML, browsers should use an XML parser, which adheres strictly to the XML specifications for parsing the document's contents.\n\n===Transitional versus strict===\nHTML 4 defined three different versions of the language: Strict, Transitional (once called Loose) and Frameset. The Strict version is intended for new documents and is considered best practice, while the Transitional and Frameset versions were developed to make it easier to transition documents that conformed to older HTML specification or didn't conform to any specification to a version of HTML 4. The Transitional and Frameset versions allow for presentational markup, which is omitted in the Strict version. Instead, [[cascading style sheets]] are encouraged to improve the presentation of HTML documents. Because XHTML 1 only defines an XML syntax for the language defined by HTML 4, the same differences apply to XHTML 1 as well.\n\nThe Transitional version allows the following parts of the vocabulary, which are not included in the Strict version:\n* '''A looser content model'''\n** Inline elements and plain text are allowed directly in: <code>body</code>, <code>blockquote</code>, <code>form</code>, <code>noscript</code> and <code>noframes</code>\n* '''Presentation related elements'''\n** underline (<code>u</code>)(Deprecated. can confuse a visitor with a hyperlink.)\n** strike-through (<code>s</code>)\n** <code>center</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.)\n** <code>font</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.)\n** <code>basefont</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.)\n* '''Presentation related attributes'''\n** <code>background</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) and <code>bgcolor</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) attributes for <code>body</code> (required element according to the W3C.) element.\n** <code>align</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) attribute on <code>div</code>, <code>form</code>, paragraph (<code>p</code>) and heading (<code>h1</code>...<code>h6</code>) elements\n** <code>align</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.), <code>noshade</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.), <code>size</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) and <code>width</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) attributes on <code>hr</code> element\n** <code>align</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.), <code>border</code>, <code>vspace</code> and <code>hspace</code> attributes on <code>img</code> and <code>object</code> (caution: the <code>object</code> element is only supported in Internet Explorer (from the major browsers)) elements\n** <code>align</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) attribute on <code>legend</code> and <code>caption</code> elements\n** <code>align</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) and <code>bgcolor</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) on <code>table</code> element\n** <code>nowrap</code> (Obsolete), <code>bgcolor</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.), <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> on <code>td</code> and <code>th</code> elements\n** <code>bgcolor</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) attribute on <code>tr</code> element\n** <code>clear</code> (Obsolete) attribute on <code>br</code> element\n** <code>compact</code> attribute on <code>dl</code>, <code>dir</code> and <code>menu</code> elements\n** <code>type</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.), <code>compact</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) and <code>start</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) attributes on <code>ol</code> and <code>ul</code> elements\n** <code>type</code> and <code>value</code> attributes on <code>li</code> element\n** <code>width</code> attribute on <code>pre</code> element\n* '''Additional elements in Transitional specification'''\n** <code>menu</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) list (no substitute, though unordered list is recommended)\n** <code>dir</code> (Deprecated. use CSS instead.) list (no substitute, though unordered list is recommended)\n** <code>isindex</code> (Deprecated.) (element requires server-side support and is typically added to documents server-side, <code>form</code> and <code>input</code> elements can be used as a substitute)\n** <code>applet</code> (Deprecated. use the <code>object</code> element instead.)\n* '''The <code>language</code> (Obsolete) attribute on script element''' (redundant with the <code>type</code> attribute).\n* '''Frame related entities'''\n** <code>iframe</code>\n** <code>noframes</code>\n** <code>target</code> (Deprecated in the <code>map</code>, <code>link</code> and <code>form</code> elements.) attribute on <code>a</code>, client-side image-map (<code>map</code>), <code>link</code>, <code>form</code> and <code>base</code> elements\n\nThe Frameset version includes everything in the Transitional version, as well as the <code>frameset</code> element (used instead of <code>body</code>) and the <code>frame</code> element.\n\n===Frameset versus transitional===\nIn addition to the above transitional differences, the frameset specifications (whether XHTML 1.0 or HTML 4.01) specify a different content model, with <code>frameset</code> replacing <code>body</code>, that contains either <code>frame</code> elements, or optionally <code>noframes</code> with a <code>body</code>.\n\n===Summary of specification versions===\nAs this list demonstrates, the loose versions of the specification are maintained for legacy support. However, contrary to popular misconceptions, the move to XHTML does not imply a removal of this legacy support. Rather the X in XML stands for extensible and the W3C is modularizing the entire specification and opening it up to independent extensions. The primary achievement in the move from XHTML 1.0 to XHTML 1.1 is the modularization of the entire specification. The strict version of HTML is deployed in XHTML 1.1 through a set of modular extensions to the base XHTML 1.1 specification. Likewise, someone looking for the loose (transitional) or frameset specifications will find similar extended XHTML 1.1 support (much of it is contained in the legacy or frame modules). The modularization also allows for separate features to develop on their own timetable. So for example, XHTML 1.1 will allow quicker migration to emerging XML standards such as [[MathML]] (a presentational and semantic math language based on XML) and [[XForms]]\u2014a new highly advanced web-form technology to replace the existing HTML forms.\n\nIn summary, the HTML 4 specification primarily reined in all the various HTML implementations into a single clearly written specification based on SGML. XHTML 1.0, ported this specification, as is, to the new XML defined specification. Next, XHTML 1.1 takes advantage of the extensible nature of XML and modularizes the whole specification. XHTML 2.0 was intended to be the first step in adding new features to the specification in a standards-body-based approach.\n\n==HTML5 variants==\n\n===WHATWG HTML versus HTML5===\n{{main|HTML5}}\nThe [[WHATWG]] considers their work as ''living standard'' HTML for what constitutes the state of the art in major browser implementations by [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] ([[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]), [[Microsoft]] ([[Microsoft Edge|Edge]]), [[Google]] ([[Google Chrome|Chrome]]), [[Mozilla Foundation|Mozilla]] ([[Firefox]]), [[Opera Software|Opera]] ([[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]), and others. HTML5 is specified by the HTML Working Group of the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] following the W3C process. {{As of|2013|post=,}} both specifications are similar and mostly derived from each other, i.e., the work on HTML5 started with an older WHATWG draft, and later the WHATWG ''living standard'' was based on HTML5 drafts in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.whatwg.org/html-is-the-new-html5|title=HTML is the new HTML5|last=Hickson|first=Ian|date=2011-01-19|work=The WHATWG blog|accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/blog/2012/12/html5-smile-its-a-snapshot/|title=HTML5 \u2014 Smile, it's a Snapshot!|work=W3C Blog|date=2012-12-17|accessdate=2013-01-14}}</ref>\n\n==Hypertext features not in HTML==\nHTML lacks some of the features found in earlier hypertext systems, such as [[source tracking]], [[fat link]]s and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20050103.html|title=Reviving Advanced Hypertext|author=[[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]]|date=January 3, 2005|accessdate=June 16, 2007}}</ref> Even some hypertext features that were in early versions of HTML have been ignored by most popular web browsers until recently,{{when|date=August 2015}} such as the link element and in-browser Web page editing.\n\nSometimes [[web developer]]s or browser manufacturers remedy these shortcomings. For instance, [[wiki]]s and [[content management system]]s allow surfers to edit the Web pages they visit.\n\n==WYSIWYG editors==\nThere are some [[WYSIWYG]] editors (What You See Is What You Get), in which the user lays out everything as it is to appear in the HTML document using a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), often similar to [[word processor]]s. The editor renders the document rather than show the code, so authors do not require extensive knowledge of HTML.\n\nThe WYSIWYG editing model has been criticized,<ref>Sauer, C.: WYSIWIKI&nbsp;\u2013 Questioning WYSIWYG in the Internet Age.

As the first-born son of King [[Priam]] and Queen [[Hecuba]], who was a descendant of [[Dardanus (son of Zeus)|Dardanus]] and [[Tros (mythology)|Tros]], the founder of Troy,<ref>''Iliad'', XX, 215 ''ff.''</ref> he was a prince of the royal house and the [[heir apparent]] to his father's throne. He was married to [[Andromache]], with whom he had an infant son, [[Scamandrius]] (whom the people of Troy called [[Astyanax]]). He acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defence of Troy, \"killing 31,000 Greek fighters\", offers [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]].<ref>[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.</ref> During the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the [[Nine Worthies]] noted by [[Jacques de Longuyon]], known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, [[Homer]] places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. [[James M. Redfield|James Redfield]] describes Hector as a \"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=James M. |last=Redfield |title=Nature and Culture in the Iliad: The Tragedy of Hector |location=Durham |publisher=Duke University Press |date=1994 |page=ix}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIn Greek, {{transl|grc|H\u00e9kt\u014dr}} is a derivative of the verb {{lang-grc|\u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|\u00e9khein|label=none}}, archaic form *{{lang-grc|\u1f15\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd|h\u00e9khein|label=none}} ('to have' or 'to hold'), from [[Proto-Indo-European]] *''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/se\u01f5\u02b0-|se\u011dh-]]'' ('to hold').<ref>[[Robert S.

The [[Dardanians (Trojan)|Dardanians]] would not have been Greek, but the [[Trojan language|language of the city of Troy]] is still an open question.}}\n\n==Greek mythology==\n\n===Greatest warrior of Troy===\n\n[[File:Hektor wirft Paris seine Weichlichkeit vor (Tischbein).jpg|thumb|250px|''Hector Admonishes Paris for His Softness and Exhorts Him to Go to War'' by [[Johann Heinrich Wilhelm Tischbein|J. H. W. Tischbein]] (1751\u20131828)]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector did not approve of war between the [[Greeks]] and the Trojans.\n\nFor ten years, the Achaeans besieged Troy and their allies in the east. Hector commanded the Trojan army, with a number of subordinates including [[Polydamas (Iliad)|Polydamas]], and his brothers [[Deiphobus]], [[Helenus]], and [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]]. By all accounts, Hector was the best warrior the Trojans and their allies could field, and his fighting prowess was admired by Greeks and his own people alike.\n\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]], when faced with his attack, described him as what [[Robert Fagles]] translated as an 'incredible dynamite', and a 'maniac'.\n\n====Duel with Protesilaus====\nIn the ''[[Iliad]]'', Hector's exploits in the war prior to the events of the book are recapitulated. He had fought the Greek champion [[Protesilaus]] in single combat at the start of the war and killed him. A prophecy had stated that the first Greek to land on Trojan soil would die. Thus, [[Protesilaus]], [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]], and [[Odysseus]] would not land. Finally, Odysseus threw his shield out and landed on that, and Protesilaus jumped next from his own ship. In the ensuing fight, Hector killed him, fulfilling the prophecy.\n\n[[File:Ajax and Hector exchange gifts.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ajax and Hector exchange gifts ([[woodcut]] in [[Andrea Alciato|Andreas Alciatus]], ''Emblematum libellus'', 1591).]]\n\n====Duel with Ajax====\nAs described by Homer in the Iliad<ref>''Iliad'', VII 43-305.</ref> at the advice of his brother [[Helenus]] (who also is divinely inspired) and being told by him that he is not destined to die yet, Hector managed to get both armies seated and challenges any one of the Greek warriors to [[single combat]]. The [[Argives]] were initially reluctant to accept the challenge.  However, after [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]]'s chiding, nine Greek [[hero]]es stepped up to the challenge and drew by lot to see who was to face Hector. [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] wins and fights Hector to a stalemate for the entire day. With neither able to achieve victory as the day was about to end, they express admiration for each other's courage, skill, and strength. Hector gave Ajax his sword, which Ajax later uses to kill himself. Ajax gave Hector his girdle that Achilles will later attach to his chariot to drag Hector's corpse around the walls of Troy.\n\nThe Greeks and the Trojans make a truce to bury the dead. In the early dawn the next day the Greeks take advantage of it to build a wall and ditch around the ships. Zeus is watching in the distance.<ref>''Iliad'', VII, 433 ''ff.''</ref>\n\n====Duel with Achilles====\nAnother mention of Hector's exploits in the early years of war was given in the [[Iliad]] in book IX. During the embassy to [[Achilles]], Odysseus, [[Phoenix (son of Amyntor)|Phoenix]] and [[Ajax (mythology)|Ajax]] all try to persuade Achilles to rejoin the fight. In his response, Achilles points out that while Hector was terrorizing the Greek forces now, and that while he himself had fought in their front lines, Hector had 'no wish' to take his force far beyond the walls and out from the Skiaian Gate and nearby oak tree. He then claims, 'There he stood up to me alone one day, and he barely escaped my onslaught.'\nAnother duel that took place, although Hector received help from Aeneas and Deiphobus, was when Hector rushed to try to save his brother Troilus from Achilles' hands. But he came too late and Troilus had already perished. All Hector could do was to take the lifeless body of Troilus while Achilles escaped after he fought his way through from the Trojans reinforcement.\n\n[[File:Hector Astyanax MN Jatta.jpg|thumb|250px|Hector's last visit with his wife, [[Andromache]], and infant son [[Astyanax]], startled by his father's helmet ([[Apulian vase painting|Apulian red-figure vase]], 370\u2013360 BC)]]\n\nIn the tenth year of the war, observing [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] avoiding combat with [[Menelaus]], Hector upbraids him with having brought trouble on his whole country and now refusing to fight. Paris therefore proposes [[single combat]] between himself and Menelaus, with [[Helen of Troy|Helen]] to go to the victor, ending the war.<ref>''Iliad'', III.</ref> The duel, however, leads to inconclusive results due to intervention by [[Aphrodite]] who leads Paris off the field. After [[Pandarus]]  wounds [[Menelaus]] with an arrow the fight begins again.\n\nThe Greeks attack and drive the Trojans back. Hector must now go out to lead a counter-attack. According to Homer<ref>Iliad, VI 390-480</ref> his wife [[Andromache]], carrying in her arms her son [[Astyanax]], intercepts Hector at the gate, pleading with him not to go out for her sake as well as his son's. Hector knows that Troy and the house of Priam are doomed to fall and that the gloomy fate of his wife and infant son will be to die or go into slavery in a foreign land. With understanding, compassion, and tenderness he explains that he cannot personally refuse to fight, and comforts her with the idea that no one can take him until it is his time to go. The gleaming bronze helmet frightens Astyanax and makes him cry.{{refn|group=note|This Trojan helmet was made famous by Denys L. Page in ''History and the Homeric Iliad'', Chapter VI, \"Some Mycenaean relics in the Iliad\", as the Greeks do not wear bronze helmets in the poem's [[Oral-formulaic composition|epic formulae]], but they did in the Homeric Age; therefore, scholar Denys L. Page concludes (on other evidence as well) that the bronze helmet of Hector descends in oral poetry from [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times.}} Hector takes it off, embraces his wife and son, and for his sake prays aloud to [[Zeus]] that his son might be chief after him, become more glorious in battle than he, to bring home the blood of his enemies, and his mother proud. Once he left for battle, those in the house began to mourn as they knew he would not return. Hector and Paris pass through the gate and rally the Trojans, raising havoc among the Greeks.\n\n===Trojan counter-attack===\nZeus [[Weighing of souls|weighs the fates]] of the two armies in the balance, and that of the Greeks sinks down. The Trojans press the Greeks into their camp over the ditch and wall and would have laid hands on the ships, but [[Agamemnon]] rallies the Greeks in person. The Trojans are driven off, night falls, and Hector resolves to take the camp and burn the ships the next day. The Trojans bivouac in the field.\n{{quote|A thousand camp-fires gleamed upon the plain ....<ref>''Iliad'', VIII, 542 ''ff.''</ref>}}\n\nThe next day Agamemnon rallies the Greeks and drives the Trojans\n{{quote|like a herd of cows maddened with fright when a lion has attacked them ...<ref>''Iliad'', XI, 171 ''ff.''</ref>}}\nHector refrains from battle until Agamemnon leaves the field, wounded in the arm by a spear. Then Hector rallies the Trojans:\n{{quote|... like some fierce tempest that swoops down upon the sea ...|sign=|source=}}\n[[Diomedes]] and [[Odysseus]] hinder Hector and win the Greeks some time to retreat, but the Trojans sweep down upon the wall and rain blows upon it. The Greeks in the camp contest the gates to secure entrance for their fleeing warriors. The Trojans try to pull down the ramparts while the Greeks rain arrows upon them. Hector smashes open a gate with a large stone, clears the gate and calls on the Trojans to scale the wall, which they do, and\n{{quote|... all was uproar and confusion.<ref>''Iliad'', XII.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:THAM-Battle at the ships sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Battle at the ships, on a [[Roman Empire|Roman-era]] [[sarcophagus]], 225\u2013250 AD]]\n\nThe battle rages inside the camp. Hector goes down, hit by a stone thrown by Ajax, but [[Apollo]] arrives from Olympus and infuses strength into \"the shepherd of the people\", who orders a chariot attack, with Apollo clearing the way. Many combats, deaths, boasts, threats, epithets, figures of speech, stories, lines of poetry and books of the Iliad later, Hector lays hold of [[Protesilaus]]' ship and calls for fire. The Trojans cannot bring it to him, as Ajax kills everyone who tries. Eventually, Hector breaks Ajax' spear with his sword, forcing him to give ground, and he sets the ship on fire.<ref>''Iliad'', XV, end.</ref>\n\nThese events are all according to the will of the gods, who have decreed the fall of Troy, and therefore intend to tempt Achilles back into the war. [[Patroclus]], Achilles' closest companion, disguised in the armor of [[Achilles]], enters the combat leading the [[Myrmidons]] and the rest of the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] to force a Trojan withdrawal. After Patroclus has routed the Trojan army, Hector, with the aid of [[Apollo]] and [[Euphorbus]], kills Patroclus, vaunting over him:\n{{quote|\"Wretch! Achilleus, great as he was, could do nothing to help you.\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\">The Iliad, book XVI</ref>}}\nThe dying Patroclus foretells Hector's death:\n{{quote|\"You yourself are not one who shall live long, but now already death and powerful destiny are standing beside you, to go down under the hands of Aiakos' great son, Achilleus\"<ref name=\"The Iliad, book XVI\"/>}}\n\n===Hector's last fight===\n\n{{quote|Alas! the gods have lured me on to my destruction. ... death is now indeed exceedingly near at hand and there is no way out of it \u2013 for so [[Zeus]] and his son [[Apollo]] the far-darter have willed it, though heretofore they have been ever ready to protect me. My doom has come upon me; let me not then die ingloriously and without a struggle, but let me first do some great thing that shall be told among men hereafter.|cite=Spoken by Hector facing [[Achilles]], after a missed spear-throw; ''Iliad'', Book XXII, lines 299\u2013305}}\n\nHector strips the armor of Achilles off the fallen Patroclus and gives it to his men to take back to the city. Glaucus accuses Hector of cowardice for not challenging Ajax. Stung, Hector calls for the armor, puts it on, and uses it to rally the Trojans.  [[Zeus]] regards the donning of a hero's armor as an act of insolence by a fool about to die, but it makes Hector strong for now.<ref>''Iliad'', XVII</ref>\n\nThe next day, the enraged Achilles renounces the wrath that kept him out of action and routs the Trojans, forcing them back to the city. Hector chooses to remain outside the gates of Troy to face Achilles, partly because had he listened to Polydamas and retreated with his troops the previous night, Achilles would not have killed so many Trojans. When he sees Achilles, however, Hector is seized by fear and turns to flee. Achilles chases him around the city three times before Hector masters his fear and turns to face Achilles. But Athena, in the disguise of Hector's brother [[Deiphobus]], has deluded Hector. He requests from Achilles that the victor should return the other's body after the duel, (though Hector himself made it clear he planned to throw the body of Patroclus to the dogs) but Achilles refuses. Achilles hurls his spear at Hector, who dodges it, but Athena brings it back to Achilles' hands without Hector noticing. Hector then throws his own spear at Achilles; it hits his shield and does no injury. When Hector turns to face his supposed brother to retrieve another spear, he sees no one there. At that moment he realizes that he is doomed. Hector decides that he will go down fighting and that men will talk about his bravery in years to come. The desire to achieve ever-lasting honor was one of the most fierce for soldiers living in the timocratic (honor-based) society of the age.\n\n[[File:Triumph of Achilles in Corfu Achilleion.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|left|Triumphant Achilles dragging Hector's lifeless body in [[Troy]]. (A [[fresco]] in the [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]], [[Corfu]])]]\nHector pulls out his sword, now his only weapon, and charges. But Achilles grabbed his thrown spears that were delivered to him by the unseen Athena who wore the Hades helmet. Achilles then aimed his spear and pierced the collar bone section of Hector, the only part of the stolen Armor of Achilles that did not protect Hector. The wound was fatal yet allowed Hector to speak to Achilles. In his final moments, Hector begs Achilles for an honorable funeral, but Achilles replies that he will let the dogs and vultures devour Hector's flesh. (Throughout the Homeric poems, several references are made to dogs, vultures, and other creatures that devour the dead. It can be seen as another way of saying one will die.) Hector dies, prophesying that Achilles' death will follow soon:\n\n<blockquote>Be careful now; for I might be made into the gods' curse ... upon you, on that day when Paris and [[Phoibos]] Apollo...destroy you in the Skainan gates, for all your valor.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Iliad|last = Lattimore|first = Richmond|publisher = University of Chicago Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-226-47049-8|location = |page = 467}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter his death, Achilles slits Hector's heels and passes the girdle that Ajax had given Hector through the slits. He then fastens the girdle to his chariot and drives his fallen enemy through the dust to the [[Danaan]] camp. For the next twelve days, Achilles mistreats the body, but it remains preserved from all injury by [[Apollo]] and [[Aphrodite]]. After these twelve days, the gods can no longer stand watching it and send down two messengers: [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], another messenger god, and Thetis, the mother of Achilles.  Thetis has told Achilles to allow King Priam to come and take the body for ransom. Once King Priam has been notified that Achilles will allow him to claim the body, he goes to his strongroom to withdraw the ransom. The ransom King Priam offers includes twelve fine robes, twelve white mantles, several richly embroidered tunics, ten bars of yellow gold, a special gold cup, and several cauldrons. Priam himself goes to claim his son's body, and Hermes grants him safe passage by casting a charm that will make anyone who looks at him fall asleep.\n\n{{quote|<poem>\nThink of thy father, and this helpless face behold\nSee him in me, as helpless and as old!\nThough not so wretched: there he yields to me,\nThe first of men in sovereign misery!\nThus forced to kneel, thus groveling to embrace\nThe scourge and ruin of my realm and race;\nSuppliant my children\u2019s murderer to implore,\nAnd kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!\n</poem>\n|cite=Spoken by [[Priam]] to [[Achilles]]; ''Iliad'', Book XXIV, [[Alexander Pope|Pope's]] translation}}\n\nAchilles, moved by Priam's actions and following his mother's orders sent by Zeus, returns Hector's body to Priam and promises him a truce of twelve days to allow the Trojans to perform funeral rites for Hector. Priam returns to Troy with the body of his son, and it is given full funeral honors. Even Helen mourns Hector, for he had always been kind to her and protected her from spite. The last lines of the ''Iliad'' are dedicated to Hector's funeral.

It was replaced later by the [[Heraion of Samos|Heraion]], one of the largest of all Greek temples (Greek [[altars]] were in front of the temples, under the open sky). There were many temples built on this site so evidence is somewhat confusing and archaeological dates are uncertain.\n\nThe temple created by the [[Rhoecus]] sculptors and architects was destroyed between 570\u2013560 BCE. This was replaced by the [[Polycrates|Polycratean]]  temple 540\u2013530 BCE. In one of these temples we see a forest of 155 columns. There is also no evidence of tiles on this temple suggesting either the temple was never finished or that the temple was open to the sky.\n\nEarlier sanctuaries, whose dedication to Hera is less certain, were of the Mycenaean type called \"house sanctuaries\".<ref>Martin Persson Nilsson, ''The Minoan-Mycenaean Religion and Its Survival in Greek Religion'' (Lund) 1950 pt.

In [[Magna Graecia]], two Doric temples to Hera were constructed at [[Paestum]], about 550 BCE and about 450 BCE.

Zeus then preyed on her empathy for animals and other beings, created a thunderstorm and transformed himself into a little cuckoo.  As a cuckoo, Zeus pretended to be in distress outside her window.  Hera, feeling pity towards the bird brought it inside and held it to her breast to warm it. Zeus then transformed back into himself and raped her.

From [[Vulci]], [[Etruria]].]]\n\nHera is the stepmother and enemy of [[Heracles]]. The name Heracles means \"Glory of Hera\". There are three alternative stories about the birth of Heracles and Hera's role in preventing it. In Homer's ''Iliad'', when Alcmene was about to give birth to Heracles, Zeus announced to all the gods that on that day a child by Zeus himself, would be born and rule all those around him. Hera, after requesting Zeus to swear an oath to that effect, descended from [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] to [[Argos]] and made the wife of [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]] (son of Perseus) give birth to [[Eurystheus]] after only seven months, while at the same time preventing Alcmene from delivering Heracles. This resulted in the fulfilment of Zeus's oath in that it was Eurystheus rather than Heracles.<ref name=\"Hom. Il. 19.95\"/> In an alternative version mentioned in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', when [[Alcmene]] was pregnant with Zeus' child, Hera tried to prevent the birth from occurring by having [[Eileithyia]] (the Greek equivalent of [[Lucina (mythology)|Lucina]]) tie Alcmene's legs in knots. Her attempt was foiled when [[Galanthis]] frightened Eileithyia while she was tying Alcmene's legs and Heracles was born. Hera thus punishes Galanthis by turning her into a [[weasel]].<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cZATs1x4BnsC&dq=Galanthis+greek+mythology&lr=&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Gods, Demigods and Demons: An Encyclopedia of Greek Mythology|last=Evslin|first=Bernard|date=2012-10-30|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=9781453264386|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"Ov.

The witches were successful in preventing the birth until [[Galanthis|Historis]], daughter of Tiresias, thought of a trick to deceive the witches. Like Galanthis, Historis announced that Alcmene had delivered her child; having been deceived, the witches went away, allowing Alcmene to give birth.<ref name=\"Paus. 9.11.3\">[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.11.3 9.11.3]</ref>\n\nHera's wrath against Zeus' son continues and while Heracles is still an infant, Hera sends two [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpents]] to kill him as he lay in his cot. Heracles throttles the snakes with his bare hands and was found by his nurse playing with their limp bodies as if they were a child's toy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n[[File:Jacopo Tintoretto - The Origin of the Milky Way - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|''The Origin of the Milky Way'' by [[Jacopo Tintoretto]].]]\nOne account of the origin of the [[Milky Way]] is that Zeus had tricked Hera into nursing the infant Heracles: discovering who he was, she pulled him from her breast, and a spurt of her milk formed the smear across the sky that can be seen to this day.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=867195|title=The Origin of the Milky Way in the National Gallery on JSTOR}}</ref> Unlike any Greeks, the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]]s instead pictured a full-grown bearded Heracles at Hera's breast: this may refer to his adoption by her when he became an Immortal. He had previously wounded her severely in the breast.\n\nWhen Heracles reached adulthood, Hera [[Insanity|drove him mad]], which led him to murder his family and this later led to him undertaking his famous labours. Hera assigned Heracles to labour for King [[Eurystheus]] at Mycenae. She attempted to make almost each of Heracles' twelve labours more difficult. When he fought the [[Lernaean Hydra]], she sent a [[Karkinos|crab]] to bite at his feet in the hopes of distracting him. Later Hera stirred up the Amazons against him when he was on one of his quests. When Heracles took the cattle of [[Geryon]], he shot Hera in the right breast with a triple-barbed arrow: the wound was incurable and left her in constant pain, as [[Dione (mythology)|Dione]] tells [[Aphrodite]] in the ''[[Iliad]]'', Book V. Afterwards, Hera sent a [[gadfly (mythology)|gadfly]] to bite the cattle, irritate them and scatter them. Hera then sent a flood which raised the water level of a river so much that Heracles could not ford the river with the cattle. He piled stones into the river to make the water shallower. When he finally reached the court of Eurystheus, the cattle were sacrificed to Hera.\n\nEurystheus also wanted to sacrifice the [[Cretan Bull]] to Hera. She refused the sacrifice because it reflected glory on Heracles. The bull was released and wandered to Marathon, becoming known as the [[Marathonian Bull]].\n\nSome myths state that in the end, Heracles befriended Hera by saving her from [[Porphyrion]], a giant who tried to rape her during the [[Gigantomachy]], and that she even gave her daughter [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]] as his bride. Whatever myth-making served to account for an archaic representation of Heracles as \"Hera's man\" it was thought [[Decorum|suitable]] for the builders of the Heraion at [[Paestum]] to depict the exploits of Heracles in [[bas-relief]]s.<ref>Kerenyi, p 131</ref>[[File:Hera Staatliche Antikensammlungen 2685 full.jpg|thumb|Hera (according to inscription); [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] of an Attic [[white-ground]] ''[[Kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]]'' from [[Vulci]], ca. 470 BC]]\n\n=== Leto and the Twins: Apollo and Artemis ===\nWhen Hera discovered that [[Leto]] was pregnant and that Zeus was the father, she convinced the nature spirits to prevent Leto from giving birth on [[Solid earth|terra-firma]], the mainland, any island at sea, or any place under the sun.<ref>[[Gaius Julius Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 140).</ref> Poseidon gave pity to Leto and guided her to the floating island of [[Delos]], which was neither mainland nor a real island where Leto was able to give birth to her children.<ref>Hammond.

He was slain by Artemis and Apollo.\n\n===Io and Argus===\n[[Image:Figino.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Io (mythology)|Io]] with [[Zeus]]'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio Figino]].]]\n\nHera saw a lone thundercloud and raced down in an attempt to catch Zeus with a mistress.  Zeus saw her coming and transformed his new bride [[Io (mythology)|Io]] into a little snow-white cow. However, Hera was not fooled and demanded that Zeus give her the heifer as a present. Zeus could not refuse his queen without drawing suspicion so he had to give her the beautiful heifer.<ref name=\"D'Aulaire\" />\n\nOnce Io was given to Hera, she tied her to a tree and sent her servant [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]] to keep Io separated from Zeus.  Argus was a loyal servant to Hera and he has immense strength and one hundred eyes all over his body. It was not possible to go past Argus since he never closed more than half his eyes at any time. Zeus was afraid of Hera's wrath could not personally intervene, so to save Io, he commanded [[Hermes]] to kill Argus, which he does by lulling all one hundred eyes into eternal sleep. In [[Ovid]]'s interpolation, when Hera learned of Argus' death, she took his eyes and placed them in the plumage of the [[peacock]], her favorite animal, accounting for the eye pattern in its tail and making it the vainest of all animals.<ref>Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' I.624ff and II.531. The [[peacock]] (Greek ''taos''), not native to Greece or Western Asia, was unknown to Hellenes until the time of [[Alexander the Great]].</ref> Hera, furious about Io being free and the death of Argus, sent a gadfly (Greek ''oistros'', compare [[Estrus cycle|oestrus]]) to sting Io as she wandered the earth.  Eventually Io made it to [[Egypt]], the Egyptians worshiped the snow-white heifer and named her the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]].  Hera permitted Zeus to change Io back into her human form, under the condition that he never look at her again.  Io, the goddess-queen of Egypt, then bore Zeus' son as the next King.<ref name=\"D'Aulaire\" />\n\n=== Judgment of Paris ===\n{{Main|Judgement of Paris}}\n[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|right|300px|This is one of the [[Judgement of Paris#Gallery|many works]] depicting the event. Hera is the goddess in the center, wearing the crown. ''Das Urteil des Paris'' by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], ca. 1757]]\n\nA prophecy stated that a son of the sea-nymph [[Thetis]], with whom Zeus fell in love after gazing upon her in the oceans off the Greek coast, would become greater than his father.<ref>Scholiast on Homer\u2019s ''[[Iliad]]''; Hyginus, ''[[Fabulae]]'' 54; Ovid, ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 11.217.</ref> Possibly for this reasons,<ref>Apollodorus, ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.+1.1.1&redirect=true Library]'' 3.168.</ref> Thetis was betrothed to an elderly human king, [[Peleus]] son of [[Aeacus]], either upon Zeus' orders,<ref>[[Pindar#Chronological order|Pindar]], ''Nemean'' 5 ep2; Pindar, ''Isthmian'' 8 str3\u2013str5.</ref> or because she wished to please Hera, who had raised her.<ref>Hesiod, ''[[Catalogue of Women]]'' fr. 57; ''[[Cypria]]'' fr. 4.</ref> All the gods and goddesses as well as various mortals were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of [[Achilles]]) and brought many gifts.<ref>Photius, ''Myrobiblion'' 190.</ref> Only Eris, goddess of discord, was not invited and was stopped at the door by Hermes, on Zeus' order. She was annoyed at this, so she threw from the door a gift of her own:<ref>Hyginus, ''[[Fabulae]]'' 92.</ref> a [[golden apple]] inscribed with the word \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u1fc3 (kallist\u0113i, \"To the fairest\").<ref>Apollodorus ''Epitome'' E.3.2</ref> [[Aphrodite]], Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.\n\nThe goddesses quarreled bitterly over it, and none of the other gods would venture an opinion favoring one, for fear of earning the enmity of the other two. They chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]], a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince. After bathing in the spring of [[Mount Ida]] where Troy was situated, they appeared before Paris to have him choose. The goddesses undressed before him, either at his request or for the sake of winning. Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so they resorted to bribes. Hera offered Paris political power and control of all of [[Asia Minor|Asia]], while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King [[Menelaus]] of [[Sparta#Prehistory|Sparta]]. The other two goddesses were enraged by this and through Helen's abduction by Paris they brought about the [[Trojan War]].\n\n=== ''The Iliad'' ===\nHera plays a substantial role in ''[[The Iliad]]'', appearing in a number of books throughout the epic poem. In accordance with ancient Greek mythology, Hera's hatred towards the [[Troy|Trojans]], which was started by Paris' decision that [[Aphrodite]] was the most beautiful goddess, is seen as through her support of the Greeks during the war. Throughout the epic Hera makes many attempts to thwart the Trojan army. In books 1 and 2, Hera declares that the Trojans must be destroyed. Hera persuades [[Athena]] to aid the [[Achaeans (Homer)|Achaeans]] in battle and she agrees to assist with interfering on their behalf.<ref name=\"Iliad\">{{cite book|last1=Homer|title=The Iliad}}</ref>\n\nIn book 5, Hera and Athena plot to harm [[Ares]], who had been seen by [[Diomedes]] in assisting the Trojans. Diomedes called for his soldiers to fall back slowly. Hera, Ares' mother, saw Ares' interference and asked [[Zeus]], Ares' father, for permission to drive Ares away from the battlefield. Hera encouraged Diomedes to attack Ares and he threw his spear at the god. Athena drove the spear into Ares' body, and he bellowed in pain and fled to [[Mt. Olympus]], forcing the Trojans to fall back.<ref name=\"Iliad\" />\n\n[[Image:James Barry 001.jpg|thumb|300px|''Jupiter and Juno on Mount Ida'' by [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], 1773 (City Art Galleries, Sheffield.)]]\n\nIn book 8, Hera tries to persuade [[Poseidon]] to disobey Zeus and help the Achaean army. He refuses, saying he doesn\u2019t want to go against Zeus. Determined to intervene in the war, Hera and Athena head to the battlefield. However, seeing the two flee, Zeus sent Iris to intercept them and make them return to Mt. Olympus or face grave consequences. After prolonged fighting, Hera sees Poseidon aiding the Greeks and giving them motivation to keep fighting.\n\nIn book 14 Hera devises a plan to deceive Zeus. Zeus set a decree that the gods were not allowed to interfere in the mortal war. Hera is on the side of the Achaeans, so she plans a [[Deception of Zeus]] where she seduces him, with help from Aphrodite, and tricks him into a deep sleep, with the help of [[Hypnos]], so that the Gods could interfere without the fear of Zeus.<ref>Homer. ''Iliad'', Book 14, Lines 153-353.</ref>\n\nIn book 21, Hera continues her interference with the battle as she tells [[Hephaestus]] to prevent the river from harming [[Achilles]].  Hephaestus sets the battlefield ablaze, causing the river to plead with Hera, promising her he will not help the Trojans if Hephaestus stops his attack. Hephaestus stops his assault and Hera returns to the battlefield where the gods begin to fight amongst themselves.<ref name=\"Iliad\" />\n\n== Smaller stories involving Hera ==\n'''Echo'''\n* According to the urbane retelling of myth in [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'',<ref>''Metamorphoses'', iii.341-401.</ref> for a long time, a [[nymph]] named [[Echo (mythology)|Echo]] had the job of distracting Hera from [[Zeus]]' affairs by leading her away and flattering her.  When Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to only repeat the words of others (hence our modern word \"[[Echo (phenomenon)|echo]]\").\n'''Semele and Dionysus'''\n* When Hera learned that [[Semele]], daughter of [[Cadmus]] King of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], was pregnant by Zeus, she disguised herself as Semele's nurse and persuaded the princess to insist that Zeus show himself to her in his true form. When he was compelled to do so, having sworn by [[Styx]] <ref name=\"Hamilton\">Hamilton, Edith (1969).  \"Mythology\".</ref>  his thunder and lightning destroyed Semele. Zeus took Semele's unborn child, [[Dionysus]] and completed its gestation sewn into his own thigh.\n* In another version, Dionysus was originally the son of Zeus by either Demeter or [[Persephone]]. Hera sent her Titans to rip the baby apart, from which he was called Zagreus (\"Torn in Pieces\"). Zeus rescued the heart; or, the heart was saved, variously, by [[Athena]], [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]], or [[Demeter]].<ref>Seyffert ''Dictionary''</ref> Zeus used the heart to recreate [[Dionysus]] and implant him in the womb of Semele\u2014hence Dionysus became known as \"the twice-born\". Certain versions imply that Zeus gave Semele the heart to eat to impregnate her. Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to reveal his true form, which killed her. Dionysus later managed to rescue his mother from the underworld and have her live on Mount Olympus.\n* See also [[Dionysus#Birth|Dionysus' birth]] for other variations.\n'''Lamia'''\n* [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]] was a queen of [[Libya]], whom Zeus loved. Hera turned her into a monster and murdered their children. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and Lamia's grief and rage turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her eyes so that she would always obsess over the image of her dead children. Zeus gave her the gift to be able to take her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of other mothers and ate their children.<ref name=\":2\" />\n'''Gerana'''\n* [[Gerana]] was a queen of the [[Pygmies]] who boasted she was more beautiful than Hera. The wrathful goddess turned her into a crane and proclaimed that her bird descendants should wage eternal war on the Pygmy folk.<ref>[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' 6.89 - 91</ref>\n\n[[Image:Hera Prometheus Cdm Paris 542.jpg|thumb|right|Hera and [[Prometheus]], [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] of a 5th-century BCE cup from [[Vulci]], [[Etruria]]]]'''Cydippe'''\n* [[Cydippe]], a priestess of Hera, was on her way to a festival in the goddess' honor.  The oxen which were to pull her cart were overdue and her sons, [[Kleobis and Biton|Biton]] and [[Cleobis]], pulled the cart the entire way (45 [[stadia (length)|stadia]], 8 kilometers).  Cydippe was impressed with their devotion to her and Hera so asked Hera to give her children the best gift a god could give a person.  Hera ordained that the brothers would die in their sleep.\n* This honor bestowed upon the children was later used by [[Solon]], as a proof while trying to convince [[Croesus]]  that it is impossible to judge a person's happiness until they have died a fruitful death after a joyous life.<ref>Herodotus' ''History'', Book I</ref>\n'''Tiresias'''\n* [[Tiresias]] was a priest of Zeus, and as a young man he encountered two snakes mating and hit them with a stick. He was then transformed into a woman. As a woman, Tiresias became a priestess of Hera, married and had children, including [[Manto (mythology)|Manto]]. After seven years as a woman, Tiresias again found mating snakes; depending on the myth, either she made sure to leave the snakes alone this time, or, according to [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], trampled on them and became a man once more.<ref>Hygini, ''[[Gaius Julius Hyginus#Fabulae|Fabulae]]'', LXXV</ref>\n* As a result of his experiences, Zeus and Hera asked him to settle the question of which sex, male or female, experienced more pleasure during [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]]. Zeus claimed it was women; Hera claimed it was men. When Tiresias sided with Zeus, Hera struck him blind.<ref name=\":3\" /> Since Zeus could not undo what she had done, he gave him the gift of prophecy.\n* An alternative and less commonly told story has it that Tiresias was blinded by [[Athena]] after he stumbled onto her bathing naked. His mother, [[Chariclo]], begged her to undo her curse, but Athena could not; she gave him prophecy instead.\n'''Chelone'''\n* At the marriage of Zeus and Hera, a [[nymph]] named [[Chelone (Greek mythology)|Chelone]] was disrespectful or refused to attend. Zeus thus, turned her into a [[tortoise]].\n'''The Golden Fleece'''\n* Hera hated [[Pelias]] because he had killed [[Sidero]], his step-grandmother, in one of the goddess's temples.  She later convinced [[Jason]] and [[Medea]] to kill Pelias. The Golden Fleece was the item that Jason needed to get his mother freed.\n'''The Metamorphoses'''\n* In [[Thrace]], Hera and Zeus turned King [[Haemus]] and [[Queen Rhodope]] into mountains,<ref>[[Ovid]], [[Metamorphoses (poem)|''Metamorphoses'']]  6.87</ref> the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkan]] ([[Haemus Mons]]) and [[Rhodope Mountains]] respectively, for their [[hubris]] in comparing themselves to the gods.\n'''Ixion'''\n* When [[Zeus]] had pity on [[Ixion]] and brought him to Olympus and introduced him to the gods, instead of being grateful, Ixion grew lustful for Hera. Zeus found out about his intentions and made a cloud in the shape of Hera, who was later named [[Nephele]], and tricked Ixion into coupling with it and from their union came [[Centaurus (Greek mythology)|Centaurus]]. So Ixion was expelled from Olympus and Zeus ordered [[Hermes]] to bind Ixion to a winged fiery wheel that was always spinning. Therefore, Ixion was bound to a burning solar wheel for all eternity, at first spinning across the heavens, but in later myth transferred to [[Tartarus]].<ref>Kerenyi 1951, p.160</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{chart top|Hera's family tree&nbsp;<ref>This chart is based upon [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', unless otherwise noted.</ref>|collapsed=no}}\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | |URA |y|GAI |URA=[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]|GAI=[[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart|URA| | | | | | | | |CRO |y|RHE |URA=<small>Uranus'&nbsp;genitals</small>|CRO=[[Cronus]]|RHE=[[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| |ZEU |V|~|~|y|~|HER | |POS | |HAD | |DEM | |HES |ZEU=[[Zeus]]|HER='''HERA'''|POS=[[Poseidon]]|HAD=[[Hades]]|DEM=[[Demeter]]|HES=[[Hestia]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |,|^|-|.| |!}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | | | |:| |!| |AAA |!|AAA= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.570 1.570&ndash;579],  [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.338 14.338], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.312 8.312], Hephaestus was apparently the son of Hera and Zeus, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | | | |:| |!| | |!|BBB |BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+927 927&ndash;929], Hephaestus was produced by Hera alone, with no father, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |!| | |!| |!}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:|ARE | |HEP |HEP=[[Hephaestus]]|ARE=[[Ares]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MET |MET=[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |ATH |ATH=[[Athena]] <ref>According to [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+886 886&ndash;890], of Zeus' children by his seven wives, Athena was the first to be conceived, but the last to be born; Zeus impregnated Metis then swallowed her, later Zeus himself gave birth to Athena \"from his head\", see Gantz, pp. 51&ndash;52, 83&ndash;84.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|LET |LET=[[Leto]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:|APO | |ART |APO=[[Apollo]]|ART=[[Artemis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MAI |MAI=[[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |HER |HER=[[Hermes]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|SEM |SEM=[[Semele]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |DIO |DIO=[[Dionysus]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |L|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|DIO |DIO=[[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]]}}\n{{chart|border=0|AAA | | | | | | | |BBB|AAA=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+183 183&ndash;200], Aphrodite was born from Uranus' severed genitals, see Gantz, pp. 99&ndash;100.</ref>|BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to [[Homer]], Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.374 3.374], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:20.105 20.105]; ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.308 8.308], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.320 320]) and Dione (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.370 5.370&ndash;71]), see Gantz, pp. 99&ndash;100.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |`|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |!}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | |APH |APH=[[Aphrodite]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==Art and events==\n{{Portal|Greek mythology|Hellenismos}}\n* [[Barberini Hera]] - a Roman sculpture of Hera/Juno\n* [[Hera Borghese]] - sculpture related to Hera\n* [[Hera Farnese]] - sculpture of Hera's head\n* [[Heraea Games]] - games dedicated to Hera\u2014the first sanctioned (and recorded) women's athletic competition to be held in the [[stadium at Olympia]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Walter Burkert|Burkert, Walter]], ''Greek Religion'' 1985.\n* Burkert, Walter, ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age'', 1998\n* Farnell, Lewis Richard,  ''The cults of the Greek states'' I: ''Zeus, Hera Athena'' Oxford, 1896.\n* {{EB1911 | last=Freese |first=John Henry |wstitle=Apollo |volume=2|pages=184\u2013186}}\n* Gantz, Timothy, ''Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources'', Johns Hopkins University Press, 1996, Two volumes: {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5360-9}} (Vol. 1), {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5362-3}} (Vol. 2).\n* [[Robert Graves|Graves, Robert]], ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' 1955.

The appearance of the [[Kebarian]] culture, of [[microlith]]ic type implies a significant rupture in the cultural continuity of Levantine Upper Paleolithic.  The Kebaran culture, with its use of microliths, is associated with the use of the bow and arrow and the domestication of the dog.<ref>Dayan, Tamar (1994), \"Early Domesticated Dogs of the Near East\" (Journal of Archaeological Science Volume 21, Issue 5, September 1994, Pages 633\u2013640)</ref> Extending from 18\u201310,500&nbsp;BC, the [[Kebaran culture]]<ref>Ronen, Avram, \"Climate, sea level, and culture in the Eastern Mediterranean 20 ky to the present\" in Valentina Yanko-Hombach, Allan S. Gilbert, Nicolae Panin and Pavel M. Dolukhanov (2007), ''The Black Sea Flood Question: Changes in Coastline, Climate, and Human Settlement'' (Springer)</ref> shows clear connections to the earlier [[Microlithic]] cultures using the bow and arrow, and using grinding stones to harvest wild grains, that developed from the {{circa|24,000|17,000&nbsp;BC}} [[Halfan culture]] of [[Egypt]], that came from the still earlier [[Aterian]] tradition of the Sahara. Some linguists see this as the earliest arrival of [[Nostratic]] languages in the Middle East.\nKebaran culture was quite successful, and was ancestral to the later [[Natufian culture]] (12,500\u20139,500&nbsp;BC), which extended throughout the whole of the Levantine region. These people pioneered the first sedentary settlements, and may have supported themselves from fishing and the harvest of wild grains plentiful in the region at that time. {{As of|2018|7|post=,}} the oldest remains of bread were discovered {{circa|12,400&nbsp;BC}} at the archaeological site [[Shubayqa 1]], once home of the Natufian hunter-gatherers, roughly 4,000 years before the advent of agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Mejia|first=Paula|date=16 July 2018|title=Found: 14,400-Year-Old Flatbread Remains That Predate Agriculture|url=https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|dead-url=no|department=Gastro Obscura|work=[[Atlas Obscura]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717191316/https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/worlds-oldest-bread|archive-date=17 July 2017|access-date=17 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nNatufian culture also demonstrates the earliest domestication of the [[dog]], and the assistance of this animal in hunting and guarding human settlements may have contributed to the successful spread of this culture. In the northern Syrian, eastern Anatolian region of the Levant, Natufian culture at [[Cayonu]] and [[Mureybet]] developed the first fully agricultural culture with the addition of wild grains, later being supplemented with domesticated sheep and goats, which were probably domesticated first by the [[Zarzian culture]] of Northern Iraq and Iran (which like the Natufian culture may have also developed from Kebaran).\n\nBy 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A ([[PPNA]]) culture developed out of the earlier local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at Jericho (guarding a valuable fresh water spring). This was replaced in 7500&nbsp;BC by Pre-Pottery Neolithic B ([[PPNB]]), dwelling in square houses, coming from Northern Syria and the Euphrates bend.\n\nDuring the period of 8500\u20137500&nbsp;BC, another hunter-gatherer group, showing clear affinities with the cultures of Egypt (particularly the Outacha retouch technique for working stone) was in Sinai. This [[Harifian]] culture<ref>Belfer-Cohen, Anna and Bar-Yosef, Ofer \"Early Sedentism in the Near East: A Bumpy Ride to Village Life\" (''Fundamental Issues in Archaeology'', 2002, Part II, 19\u201338)</ref> may have adopted the use of pottery from the [[Isnan culture]] and [[Helwan culture]] of Egypt (which lasted from 9000 to 4500&nbsp;BC), and subsequently fused with elements from the PPNB culture during the climatic crisis of 6000&nbsp;BC to form what [[Juris Zarins]] calls the Syro-Arabian pastoral technocomplex,<ref>Zarins, Yuris \"Early Pastoral Nomadiism and the Settlement of Lower Mesopotamia\" (# ''Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research'' No. 280, November, 1990)</ref> which saw the spread of the first [[Nomadic pastoralists]] in the Ancient Near East. These extended southwards along the [[Red Sea]] coast and penetrating the Arabian bifacial cultures, which became progressively more Neolithic and pastoral, and extending north and eastwards, to lay the foundations for the tent-dwelling [[Amorite|Martu]] and [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] peoples of [[Mesopotamia]].\n\nIn the [[Amuq valley]] of Syria, [[PPNB culture]] seems to have survived, influencing further cultural developments further south. Nomadic elements fused with PPNB to form the [[Minhata Culture]] and [[Yarmukian Culture]] which were to spread southwards, beginning the development of the classic mixed farming Mediterranean culture, and from 5600&nbsp;BC were associated with the [[Ghassulian culture]] of the region, the first [[chalcolithic]] culture of the Levant. This period also witnessed the development of megalithic structures, which continued into the Bronze Age.<ref>Scheltema, H.G. (2008). ''Megalithic Jordan: An Introduction and Field Guide''.

The [[Akkadian Empire]] conquered large areas of the Levant and were followed by the [[Amorites|Amorite kingdoms]], ca. 2000\u20131600&nbsp;BC, which arose in [[Mari, Syria#The Lim dynasty|Mari]], [[Yamkhad]] and [[Qatna]]. Also following the Akkadians was the extension of Khirbet Kerak ware culture, showing affinities with the [[Caucasus]], and possibly linked to the later appearance of the [[Hurrians]].\n\nAround the 17th and 16th centuries&nbsp;BC most of the older centers had been overrun. The [[Mitanni]], for a time, menaced the Hittite kingdom, but were defeated by it around the middle of the 14th. The Semitic [[Hyksos]] used the new technologies to occupy Egypt, but were expelled, leaving the empire of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] to develop in their wake. From 1550 until 1100, much of the Levant was conquered by Egypt, which in the latter half of this period contested Syria with the Hittite Empire.\n\nAt the end of the 13th century&nbsp;BC, all of these powers suddenly collapsed. Cities all around the eastern Mediterranean were sacked within a span of a few decades by assorted raiders.The Hittite empire was destroyed. Egypt repelled its attackers with only a major effort, and over the next century shrank to its territorial core, its central authority permanently weakened.\n\n==Iron Age==\nThe [[Bronze Age collapse|destruction at the end of the Bronze Age]] left a number of tiny kingdoms and City-states behind. A few [[Hittites|Hittite]] centres remained in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]], along with some [[Phoenicia]]n ports in [[Canaan]] that escaped destruction and developed into great commercial powers. The [[Israelites]] emerged as a rural culture (possibly from the displaced Canaanite refugees escaping the Bronze Age Collapse to [[Judea]] and [[Samaria]] alongside groups like the [[Shasu]] and the [[Habiru]]) mainly in the Canaanite hill-country and the Eastern Galilee, quickly spreading through the land and forming an alliance in the struggle for the land against the Philistines to the West, [[Moab]] and [[Ammon]] to the East and [[Edom]] to the South. In the 12th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC, most of the interior, as well as [[Babylonia]], was overrun by [[Aramaeans|Arameans]], while the shoreline around today's [[Gaza Strip]] was settled by [[Philistines]].\n\nIn this period a number of technological innovations spread, most notably iron working and the [[Phoenician alphabet]], developed by the Phoenicians or the Canaanites around the 16th century&nbsp;BC.\n\nDuring the 9th century&nbsp;BC, the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] began to reassert themselves against the incursions of the Aramaeans, and over the next few centuries developed into a powerful and well-organised empire. Their armies were among the first to employ cavalry, which took the place of chariots, and had a reputation for both prowess and brutality. At their height, the Assyrians dominated all of the Levant, Egypt, and Babylonia. However, the empire began to collapse toward the end of the 7th century&nbsp;BC, and was obliterated by an alliance between a resurgent [[New Kingdom of Babylonia]] and the Iranian [[Medes]].\n\nThe subsequent balance of power was short-lived, though. In the 550s&nbsp;BC the [[Persian people|Persians]] revolted against the Medes and gained control of their empire, and over the next few decades annexed to it the realms of [[Lydia]] in [[Anatolia]], [[Damascus]], [[Babylonia]], and [[Egypt]], as well as consolidating their control over the Iranian plateau nearly as far as [[India]]. This vast kingdom was divided up into various [[satrap]]ies and governed roughly according to the Assyrian model, but with a far lighter hand. Around this time [[Zoroastrianism]] became the predominant religion in [[Iran|Persia]].\n\n==Classical Age==\nPersia controlled the Levant but by the 4th century&nbsp;BC, [[Iran|Persia]] had fallen into decline. The campaigns of [[Xenophon]] illustrated how very vulnerable Persia had become to attacks by the armies organized along [[ancient Greece|Greek]] lines, which under [[Alexander the Great]] the Levant was conquered.\n\nAlexander did not live long enough to consolidate his realm, the greater share of the east went to the descendants of [[Seleucus I Nicator]]. This period saw great innovations in mathematics, science, architecture, and the like, and Greeks founded cities throughout the east, some of which grew to be the world's first major metropolises. Their culture did not, however, reach very far into the countryside.\n\nThe [[Seleucid dynasty|Seleucids]] adopted a pro-western stance that alienated both the powerful eastern satraps and the Greeks who had migrated to the east. During the 2nd century&nbsp;BC, Greek culture lost ground there, and the empire began to break apart. The Seleucid kingdom continued to decline and its heartland was overrun by the [[Roman Republic]] in 65&nbsp;BC. Judah, which [[Maccabean Revolt|had become independent]] under the [[Hasmonean dynasty]], was annexed by in 63&nbsp;BC as [[Iudaea Province]].\n\nPersian dynasty, the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]], entered in conflicts with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], and later with the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In 391, the Byzantine era began with the permanent division of the Roman Empire into East and [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] halves. Byzantine control over the sites of Israel and Judah and other parts of the Levant lasted until 636, when it was conquered by [[Arabs]] and became a part of the Caliphate.\n\nThe [[Byzantium|Byzantines]] reached their lowest point under [[Phocas]], with the Sassanids occupying the whole of the eastern Mediterranean. In 610, though, [[Heraclius]] took the throne of Constantinople and began a successful counter-attack, expelling the [[Persian people|Persians]] and invading [[Medes|Media]] and [[Assyria]]. Unable to stop his advance, [[Khosrau II]] was assassinated and the Sassanid empire fell into anarchy. Weakened by their quarrels, neither empire was prepared to deal with the onslaught of the [[Arabs]], newly unified under the banners of [[Islam]] and anxious to expand their faith. By 650, Arab forces had conquered all of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Syria (region)|Syria]], and [[Upper Egypt|Egypt]].\n\n==Later eras==\n{{Further|History of Islam}}\n{{Further|History of the Middle East}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ancient Near East]]\n* [[History of the Northern Levant]]\n** [[History of Cyprus]]\n* [[History of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of Israel]] \n** [[History of Palestine (region)]]\n** [[History of the Southeastern Levant]]\n** [[Pre-history of the Southern Levant]]\n** [[History of ancient Israel and Judah]]\n** [[History of the Sinai Peninsula]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the <ref(erences/)> tags-->\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General references===\n* Philip Mansel, ''Levant: Splendour and Catastrophe on the Mediterranean'', London, John Murray, 11 November 2010, hardback, 480 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-7195-6707-0}}, New Haven, Yale University Press, 24 May 2011, hardback, 470 pages, {{ISBN|978-0-300-17264-5}}\n\n{{commons category|History of the Levant}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://ancientneareast.tripod.com/Levant.html The History of the Ancient Near East]\n\n{{Ancient states and regions of the Levant}}\n{{Prehistoric Asia}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:History Of The Levant}}\n[[Category:Ancient Levant| ]]", "sha1": "bzsrn6uzw9mgkbs3k7zs03hbm7ug409"}}, {"title": "Horror Film", "ns": "0", "id": "13211", "redirect": {"title": "Horror film"}, "revision": {"id": "783863591", "parentid": "290580010", "timestamp": "2017-06-05T03:59:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{Redirect category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Horror film]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from other capitalisation}}\n}}", "sha1": "3p4ydft1029a8mi40fg51ho2lmaj3cq"}}, {"title": "History of Europe", "ns": "0", "id": "13212", "revision": {"id": "864374006", "parentid": "864218967", "timestamp": "2018-10-16T20:01:47Z", "contributor": {"ip": "206.176.21.37"}, "comment": "Correction", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Abraham Ortelius Map of Europe.jpg|thumb|right|Europe depicted by [[Antwerp]] cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1595|203x203px]]{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2018}}\nThe '''history of Europe''' covers the peoples inhabiting [[Europe]] from [[prehistoric|prehistory]] to the present.

The fall of the Roman Empire in AD 476 traditionally marks the start of the [[Middle Ages]].

Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] set up Protestant churches primarily in Germany, Scandinavia and England.  After 1800, the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought prosperity to Britain and Western Europe. The main powers set up colonies in most of the Americas and Africa, and parts of Asia. In the 20th century, [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]  resulted in massive numbers of deaths. The [[Cold War]] dominated European geo-politics from 1947 to 1989.  Unification into a [[European Union]] moved forward after 1950, with some setbacks. Today, most countries west of Russia belong to the [[NATO]] military alliance, along with the United States and Canada.\n\n<noinclude>{{Human history}}</noinclude><!--Makes this not appear in Portal:History of Europe-->\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n==Overview==\nSome of the best-known civilizations of prehistoric Europe were the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] and the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]], which flourished during the [[Bronze Age]] until they [[Bronze Age collapse|collapsed]] in a short period of time around 1200 BC.\n\nThe period known as [[classical antiquity]] began with the emergence of the city-states of [[Ancient Greece]]. After ultimately checking the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] advance in Europe through the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] in the 5th century BC, Greek influence reached its zenith under the expansive empire of [[Alexander the Great]], spreading throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and other parts of Europe. The [[Roman Empire]] came to dominate the entire [[Mediterranean basin]]. By 300&nbsp;AD the Roman Empire was divided into the [[Western Roman Empire|Western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern]] empires. During the 4th and 5th centuries, the [[Germanic peoples]] of [[Northern Europe]] grew in strength, and repeated attacks led to the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]. AD 476 traditionally marks the end of the classical period and the start of the [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn [[Western Europe]], Germanic peoples became more powerful in the remnants of the former Western Roman Empire and established kingdoms and empires of their own. Of all of the Germanic peoples, the [[Franks]] would rise to a position of [[hegemony]] over Western Europe, the [[Frankish Empire]] reaching its peak under [[Charlemagne]] around 800. This empire was later divided into several parts; [[West Francia]] would evolve into the [[Kingdom of France]], while [[East Francia]] would evolve into the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a precursor to modern Germany and Italy. The [[British Isles]] were the site of several large-scale migrations.\n\nThe [[Viking Age]], a period of migrations of Scandinavian peoples, occurred from the late 8th century to the middle 11th century. The [[Normans]], descendants of the [[Vikings]] who settled in Northern France, had a significant impact on many parts of Europe, from the [[Norman conquest of England]] to [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Southern Italy and Sicily]]. The [[Rus' people]] founded [[Kievan Rus']], which evolved into Russia. After 1000 the [[Crusades]] were a series of religiously motivated military expeditions originally intended to bring the [[Levant]] back under Christian rule. The Crusaders opened trade routes which enabled the merchant republics of [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] to become major economic powers.  The [[Reconquista]], a related movement, worked to reconquer [[Iberia]] for [[Christendom]].\n\n[[File:Les Tr\u00e8s Riches Heures du duc de Berry octobre detail.jpg|thumb|The peasants preparing the fields for the winter with a [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] and sowing for the winter grain, from ''[[The Very Rich Hours of the Duke of Berry]]'', c.1410|left]]\n\n[[Eastern Europe]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] was dominated by the rise and fall of the [[Mongol Empire]]. Led by [[Genghis Khan]], the Mongols were a group of [[steppe nomad]]s who established a decentralized empire which, at its height, extended from China in the east to the Black and Baltic Seas in Europe. As Mongol power waned towards the [[Late Middle Ages]], the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] rose to become the strongest of the numerous Russian principalities and republics and would grow into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in 1547. The Late Middle Ages represented a period of upheaval in Europe. The epidemic known as the [[Black Death]] and an associated famine caused demographic catastrophe in Europe as the population plummeted. Dynastic struggles and wars of conquest kept many of the states of Europe at war for much of the period. In Scandinavia, the [[Kalmar Union]] dominated the political landscape, while England fought with Scotland in the [[Wars of Scottish Independence]] and with France in the [[Hundred Years' War]]. In [[Central Europe]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] became a large territorial empire, while the Holy Roman Empire, which was an [[elective monarchy]], came to be dominated for centuries by the [[House of Habsburg]]. Russia continued to expand southward and eastward into former Mongol lands. In the [[Balkans]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] overran Byzantine lands, culminating in the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, which historians mark as the end of the Middle Ages.\n\nBeginning in the 14th century in [[Florence]] and later spreading through Europe, a [[Renaissance]] of knowledge challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. The rediscovery of classical Greek and Roman knowledge had an enormous liberating effect on intellectuals. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] seized control of the English Church and its lands. The [[European religious wars]] between German and Spanish rulers. The [[Reconquista]] ended Muslim rule in [[Iberia]]. By the 1490s a series of oceanic explorations marked the [[Age of Discovery]], establishing direct links with Africa, [[the Americas]], and Asia. Religious wars continued to be fought in Europe, until the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. The [[Spanish empire|Spanish crown]] maintained its hegemony in Europe and was the leading power on the continent until the signing of the [[Treaty of the Pyrenees]], which ended a conflict between Spain and France that had begun during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. An unprecedented series of major wars and political revolutions took place around Europe and the world in the period between 1610 and 1700.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \"States Make War But Wars Also Break States,\"''Journal of Military History'' (2010) 74#1 pp 11\u201334</ref>\n\n[[File:Maquina vapor Watt ETSIIM.jpg|thumb|A [[Watt steam engine]]. The [[steam engine]], fuelled primarily by coal, propelled the [[Industrial Revolution]] in 19th-century [[Northwestern Europe]].]]\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] began in [[Great Britain|Britain]], based on coal, steam, and textile mills.  Political change in [[continental Europe]] was spurred by the [[French Revolution]] under the motto ''[[libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]''. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control, made many reforms inside France, and transformed Western Europe. But his rise stimulated both nationalism and reaction and he was defeated in 1814\u201315 as the old royal conservatives returned to power.\n\nThe period between 1815 and 1871 saw revolutionary attempts in much of Europe (apart from Britain). They all failed however. As industrial work forces grew in Western Europe, [[socialism]] and [[trade union]] activity developed. The last vestiges of [[serfdom]] were abolished [[Serfdom in Russia|in Russia]] in 1861.  Greece and the other Balkan nations began a long slow road to independence from the Ottoman Empire, starting in the 1820s. Italy was unified in its [[Risorgimento]] in 1860. After the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870\u201371, [[Otto von Bismarck]] unified the German states into an empire that was politically and militarily dominant until 1914. Most of Europe scrambled for imperial colonies [[Scramble for Africa|in Africa]] and Asia in [[the Age of Empire]]. Britain and France built the largest empires, while diplomats ensured there were no major wars in Europe, apart from the [[Crimean War]] of the 1850s.\n\nThe outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914 was precipitated by the rise of nationalism in [[Southeastern Europe]] as the [[Great Powers]] took sides. The 1917 [[October Revolution]] led the [[Russian Empire]] to become the world's first [[communist state]], the [[Soviet Union]]. The [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], led by Britain, France, and the United States, defeated the [[Central Powers]], led by the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], in 1918. During the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] the [[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]] imposed their terms in a series of treaties, especially the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The war's human and material devastation was unprecedented.\n\nGermany lost its overseas empire and several provinces, had to pay large reparations, and was humiliated by the victors. They in turn had large debts to the United States. The 1920s were prosperous until 1929 when the [[Great Depression]] broke out, which led to the collapse of democracy in many European states. The [[Nazi]] regime under [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, rearmed Germany, and along with [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] sought to assert themselves on the continent by demands and appeasement, leading eventually to the [[Second World War]]. Most of the fighting took place on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], and the war ended with the defeat of the [[Axis powers]], leaving the USSR and the United States dominating Eastern and Western Europe respectively.\nThe [[Iron Curtain]] now separated the east under Moscow's control from the [[capitalist]] West.  The United States launched the [[Marshall Plan]] from 1948\u201351 and [[NATO]] from 1949, and rebuilt industrial economies that all were thriving by the 1950s. France and [[West Germany]] took the lead in forming the [[European Economic Community]], which eventually became the [[European Union]] (EU). Secularization saw the weakening of Protestant and Catholic churches across most of Europe, except where they were symbols of anti-government resistance, as in Poland. The [[Revolutions of 1989]] brought an end to both Soviet hegemony and [[communism]] in Eastern Europe. Germany was reunited, [[Maastricht Treaty|Europe's integration deepened]], and both NATO and the EU expanded to the east.  The EU came under increasing pressure because of the [[Great Recession|worldwide recession after 2008]].\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Main article|Prehistoric Europe|Palaeolithic Europe|Mesolithic Europe|Neolithic Europe|Stone Age|Bronze Age Europe|Iron Age Europe}}\n[[File:Map of Palaeolithic Art.png|thumb|270px|Distribution of Paleolithic [[Aurignacian]] settlements in Europe.]]\n[[File:Homo Sapiens in Europe - magdalenian distribution map-de.svg|thumb|270px|Location map of Homo Sapiens during [[Magdalenian]] culture, between 19,000 ~ 12,000 BP.

Some locally developed transitional cultures (Uluzzian in Italy and Greece, Altm\u00fchlian in Germany, [[Szeletian]] in Central Europe and [[Ch\u00e2telperronian]] in the southwest) use<!-- \"used\"? --> clearly [[Upper Palaeolithic]] technologies at very early dates.\n\nNevertheless, the definitive advance of these technologies is made by the [[Aurignacian]] culture. The origins of this culture can be located in the [[Levant]] (Ahmarian)  and Hungary (first full Aurignacian). By 35,000&nbsp;BC, the Aurignacian culture and its technology had extended through most of Europe. The last [[Neanderthals]] seem to have been forced to retreat during this process to the southern half of the [[Iberian Peninsula]].\n\nAround 29,000&nbsp;BC a new technology/culture appeared in the western region of Europe: the [[Gravettian]]. This technology/culture has been theorised to have come with migrations of people from the [[Balkans]] (see [[Kozarnika]]).\n\n\nAround 16,000&nbsp;BC, Europe witnessed the appearance of a new culture, known as [[Magdalenian]], possibly rooted in the old Gravettian. This culture soon superseded the [[Solutrean]] area and the Gravettian of mainly France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Poland, Portugal and Ukraine. The [[Hamburg culture]] prevailed in Northern Europe in the 14th and the 13th millennium BC as the [[Creswellian]] (also termed the British Late Magdalenian) did shortly after in the British Islands.\nAround 12,500&nbsp;BC, the [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]] ended. Slowly, through the following millennia, temperatures and sea levels rose, changing the environment of prehistoric people. Nevertheless, Magdalenian culture persisted until c. 10,000&nbsp;BC, when it quickly evolved into two ''[[microlith]]ist'' cultures: [[Azilian]] ([[Federmesser]]), in Spain and southern France, and then [[Sauveterrian]], in southern France and [[Tardenoisian]] in Central Europe, while in Northern Europe the [[Lyngby culture|Lyngby complex]] succeeded the Hamburg culture with the influence of the [[Federmesser]] group as well. Evidence of permanent settlement dates from the 8th millennium BC in the Balkans. The [[Neolithic]] reached Central Europe in the 6th millennium BC and parts of Northern Europe in the 5th and 4th millenniums BC.\n{{Multiple image\n |align     = center\n |direction = horizontal\n |width     =\n |image1    = Neolithic expansion.svg\n |width1    = 240\n |alt1      =\n |caption1  = Map showing the Neolithic expansions from the 7th to the 5th millennium BC, including the [[Cardium Pottery|Cardium Culture]] in blue.\n |image2    = European-late-neolithic-english.svg\n |width2   = 255\n |alt2      =\n |caption2  = Late neolithic Europe in ca. 4000-3500 BCE.\n |image3    = IE_expansion.png\n |width3    = 240\n |alt3      =\n |caption3  = Scheme of Indo-European migrations from c. 4000 to 1000 BCE according to the [[Kurgan hypothesis]]\n |image4    = Europe late bronze age.png\n |width4    = 230\n |alt4      =\n |caption4  = Late Bronze Age Europe.\n}}\n\n==Minoans and Mycenae 2700\u20131100&nbsp;BC==\n[[File:Tholos of Atreus.jpg|thumb|170px|The Treasury of [[Atreus]], or Tomb of Agamemnon in Mycenae 1250&nbsp;BC]]\n\nThe first well-known literate civilization in Europe was that of the Minoans.

Mycenaean civilization was dominated by a warrior [[aristocracy]]. Around 1400&nbsp;BC, the Mycenaeans extended their control to Crete, center of the Minoan civilization, and adopted a form of the Minoan script (called [[Linear A]]) to write their early form of [[Greek language|Greek]] in [[Linear B]].\n\nThe Mycenaean civilization perished with the [[Bronze Age collapse|collapse of Bronze-Age civilization]] on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The collapse is commonly attributed to the [[Dorian invasion]], although other theories describing natural disasters and climate change have been advanced as well.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} Whatever the causes, the Mycenaean civilization had definitely disappeared after [[LH IIIC|LH III C]], when the sites of Mycenae and Tirynth were again destroyed and lost their importance. This end, during the last years of the 12th century BC, occurred after a slow decline of the Mycenaean civilization, which lasted many years before dying out. The beginning of the 11th century BC opened a new context, that of the protogeometric, the beginning of the geometric period, the ''[[Greek Dark Ages]]'' of traditional historiography.\n\n==Classical antiquity==\n{{Main article|Classical antiquity}}\n\n[[File:Parthenon from south.jpg|thumb|The [[Parthenon]], an [[Ancient Athens|ancient Athenian]] Temple on the [[Acropolis]] (hill-top city) fell to Rome in 176&nbsp;BC]]\n\nThe Greeks and the Romans left a legacy in Europe which is evident in European languages, [[Western philosophy|thought]], visual arts and law. Ancient Greece was a collection of city-states, out of which the original form of democracy developed. [[Classical Athens|Athens]] was the most powerful and developed city, and a cradle of learning from the time of [[Pericles]]. Citizens' forums debated and legislated policy of the state, and from here arose some of the most notable classical philosophers, such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]], the last of whom taught [[Alexander the Great]].\n\nThrough his military campaigns, the king of the kingdom of [[Macedon]], Alexander, spread Hellenistic culture and learning to the banks of the [[River Indus]]. Meanwhile, the [[Roman Republic]] strengthened through victory over [[Carthage]] in the [[Punic Wars]]. Greek wisdom passed into Roman institutions, as Athens itself was absorbed under the banner of the Senate and People of Rome\u2014[[Senatus Populusque Romanus|SPQR]].\n\n[[File:Europe-In-301BC.png|thumb|Europe in the year 301 BC|left]]\n\nThe Romans expanded from Arabia to Britannia. In 44&nbsp;BC as it approached its height, its dictator [[Julius Caesar]] was [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|murdered]] by senators in an attempt to restore the Republic. In the ensuing turmoil, [[Octavian]] (ruled as Augustus; and as ''divi filius'', or Son of God, as Julius had adopted him as an heir) usurped the reins of power and fought the Roman Senate. While proclaiming the rebirth of the Republic, he had ushered in the transfer of the Roman state from a republic to an empire, the [[Roman Empire]], which lasted for more than four centuries until the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]].\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n{{Main article|Ancient Greece|Hellenistic period}}\n[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Alexander Mosaic|mosaic]] showing [[Alexander the Great]] battling [[Darius III]]]]\n\nThe [[Hellenic civilisation]] was a collection of city-states or [[poleis]] with different governments and cultures that achieved notable developments in government, philosophy, science, mathematics, politics, sports, theatre and music.\n\nThe most powerful city-states were [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], [[History of Sparta|Sparta]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], and [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]. Athens was a powerful Hellenic city-state and governed itself with an early form of [[direct democracy]] invented by [[Cleisthenes]]; the citizens of Athens voted on legislation and executive bills themselves. Athens was the home of [[Socrates]],<ref>{{cite EB1911 |first=Henry |last=Jackson|wstitle=Socrates |volume=25 |page=331}}</ref> [[Plato]], and the [[Platonic Academy]].\n\nThe Hellenic city-states established colonies on the shores of the [[Black Sea]] and the Mediterranean ([[Asian Minor]], Sicily and Southern Italy in [[Magna Graecia]]). By the late 6th century BC, all the Greek [[city states]] in Asia Minor had been incorporated into the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], while the latter had made territorial gains in the [[Balkans]] (such as [[Macedon]], [[Thrace]], [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]], etc.) and [[Eastern Europe]] proper as well. In the course of the 5th century BC, some of the Greek city states attempted to overthrow Persian rule in the [[Ionian Revolt]], which failed. This sparked the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|first Persian invasion of mainland Greece]]. At some point during the ensuing [[Greco-Persian Wars]], namely during the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece]], and precisely after the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] and the [[Battle of Artemisium]], almost all of Greece to the north of the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] had been overrun by the Persians,<ref name=\"Warfare in the Ancient World\">Brian Todd Carey, Joshua Allfree, John Cairns.

With the end of the Greco-Persian wars, the Persians were eventually decisively forced to withdraw from their territories in Europe. The Greco-Persian Wars and the victory of the Greek [[city states]] directly influenced the entire further course of European history and would set its further tone. Some Greek city-states formed the [[Delian League]] to continue fighting Persia, but Athens' position as leader of this league led Sparta to form the rival [[Peloponnesian League]]. The [[Peloponnesian War]]s ensued, and the Peloponnesian League was victorious. Subsequently, discontent with [[Spartan hegemony]] led to the [[Corinthian War]] and the defeat of Sparta at the [[Battle of Leuctra]].\n\nHellenic infighting left Greek city states vulnerable, and [[Philip II of Macedon]] united the Greek city states under his control. The son of Philip II, known as [[Alexander the Great]], invaded neighboring [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], toppled and incorporated its domains, as well as invading Egypt and going as far off as [[India]], increasing contact with people and cultures in these regions that marked the beginning of the [[Hellenistic period]].\n\nAfter the death of Alexander, his empire split into multiple kingdoms ruled by his generals, the [[Diadochi]]. The Diadochi fought against each other only three major kingdoms remained: [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], the [[Seleucid Empire]] and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia (kingdom)]]. These kingdoms spread Greek culture to regions as far away as [[Bactria]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://explorethemed.com/Diadochi.asp?c=1 |title=The Diadochi and the Hellenistic Age |work=Historical Atlas of the Mediterranean |accessdate=2018-08-23 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Cesare prima Gallia 58 a.C. jpg.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman republic]] and its neighbours in 58 BC.]]\n===The rise of Rome===\n{{Main article|Ancient Rome|Roman Republic|Roman Empire}}\n[[File:Maccari-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] addresses the [[Roman Senate]] to denounce [[Catiline]]'s conspiracy to overthrow the [[Roman Republic|Republic]], by [[Cesare Maccari]]]]\n\nMuch of Greek learning was assimilated by the nascent Roman state as it expanded outward from Italy, taking advantage of its enemies' inability to unite: the only challenge to Roman ascent came from the [[Phoenicia]]n colony of [[Carthage]], and its defeats in the three [[Punic Wars]] marked the start of Roman [[hegemony]]. First governed by [[Roman kings|kings]], then as a senatorial republic (the [[Roman Republic]]), Rome finally became an empire at the end of the 1st century BC, under [[Augustus]] and his [[authoritarian]] successors.\n\n[[File:Europe-In-117AD.png|thumb|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, under the emperor [[Trajan]]]]\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] had its centre in the Mediterranean, controlling all the countries on its shores; the northern border was marked by the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers. Under emperor [[Trajan]] (2nd century AD) the empire reached its maximum expansion, controlling approximately {{convert|5900000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of land surface, including [[Roman Britain|Britain]], [[Dacia (Roman province)|Romania]] and parts of [[Mesopotamia]]. [[Pax Romana]], a period of peace, [[Roman civilisation|civilisation]] and an efficient [[centralised government]] in the subject territories ended in the 3rd century, when a [[Crisis of the Third Century|series of civil wars]] undermined Rome's economic and social strength.\n\nIn the 4th century, the emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] were able to slow down the process of decline by splitting the empire into a Western part with a capital in Rome and an Eastern part with the capital in Byzantium, or [[Constantinople]] (now Istanbul). Whereas Diocletian severely persecuted Christianity, Constantine declared an official end to state-sponsored [[persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|persecution of Christians]] in 313 with the [[Edict of Milan]], thus setting the stage for the [[Christian Church|Church]] to become the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] in about 380.\n\n===Decline of the Roman Empire===\n{{Main article|Decline of the Roman Empire|Crisis of the Third Century}}\n[[File:Partition of the Roman Empire in 395 AD.png|thumb|left|Map of the partition of the Roman Empire in 395, at the death of [[Theodosius I]]: the [[Western Roman Empire]] is shown in red and the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire)]] is shown in purple]]\n\nThe Roman Empire had been repeatedly attacked by invading armies from Northern Europe and in 476, Rome finally fell. [[Romulus Augustus]], the last [[Roman emperor|Emperor]] of the [[Western Roman Empire]], surrendered to the Germanic King [[Odoacer]]. The British historian [[Edward Gibbon]] argued in ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' (1776) that the Romans had become decadent, they had lost civic virtue.\n\nGibbon said that the adoption of Christianity, meant belief in a better life after death, and therefore made people lazy and indifferent to the present. \"From the eighteenth century onward\", Glen W. Bowersock has remarked,<ref>Bowersock, \"The Vanishing Paradigm of the Fall of Rome\" ''Bulletin of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences'' '''49'''.8 (May 1996:29\u201343) p. 31.</ref> \"we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears.\" It remains one of the greatest historical questions, and has a tradition rich in scholarly interest.\n\nSome other notable dates are the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395 (the last time the Roman Empire was politically unified), the crossing of the [[Rhine]] in 406 by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] after the withdrawal of the legions to defend Italy against [[Alaric I]], the death of [[Stilicho]] in 408, followed by the disintegration of the western legions, the death of [[Justinian I]], the last Roman Emperor who tried to reconquer the west, in 565, and the coming of Islam after 632. Many scholars maintain that rather than a \"fall\", the changes can more accurately be described as a complex transformation.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Making of the West, Peoples and Cultures | volume=A: To 1500|author=Hunt, Lynn |author2=Thomas R.

See also the [[:File:World 820.png|map of the world in 820&nbsp;AD]].]]\n\nWhen Emperor Constantine had reconquered Rome under the banner of the [[Christian cross|cross]] in 312, he soon afterwards issued the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, declaring the legality of Christianity in the Roman Empire. In addition, Constantine officially shifted the capital of the Roman Empire from Rome to the Greek town of Byzantium, which he renamed Nova Roma- it was later named Constantinople (\"City of Constantine\").\n\nIn 395 [[Theodosius I]], who had made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, would be the last emperor to preside over a united Roman Empire. The empire was split into two halves: the [[Western Roman Empire]] centred in [[Ravenna]], and the Eastern Roman Empire (later to be referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]]) centred in Constantinople. The Western Roman Empire was repeatedly attacked by Germanic tribes (see: [[Migration Period]]), and in 476 finally fell to the [[Heruli]] chieftain [[Odoacer]].\n\n[[File:Europa in 526.png|thumb|left|Map showing Europe in 526&nbsp;AD with the three dominating powers of the west]]\n\nRoman authority in the Western part of the empire had collapsed, and a power vacuum left in the wake of this collapse; the central organization, institutions, laws and power of Rome had broken down, resulting in many areas being open to invasion by migrating tribes. Over time, [[feudalism]] and [[manorialism]] arose, two interlocking institutions that provided for division of land and labor, as well as a broad if uneven hierarchy of law and protection. These localised hierarchies were based on the bond of common people to the land on which they worked, and to a lord, who would provide and administer both local law to settle disputes among the peasants, as well as protection from outside invaders. Unlike under Roman rule, with its standard laws and military across the empire and its great bureaucracy to administer them and collect taxes, each lord (although having obligations to a higher lord) was largely sovereign in his domain. A peasant's lot could vary greatly depending on the leadership skills and attitudes to justice of the lord toward his people. [[Tithe]]s or rents were paid to the lord, who in turn owed resources, and armed men in times of war, to his lord, perhaps a regional prince. However, the levels of hierarchy were varied over time and place.\n\nThe western provinces soon were to be dominated by three great powers: first, the [[Franks]] ([[Merovingian dynasty]]) in [[Francia]] 481\u2013843&nbsp;AD, which covered much of present France and Germany; second, the [[Visigothic kingdom]] 418\u2013711&nbsp;AD in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (modern Spain); and third, the [[Ostrogothic kingdom]] 493\u2013553&nbsp;AD in [[Italy]] and parts of the western [[Balkans]] The Ostrogoths were later replaced by the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]] 568\u2013774&nbsp;AD. These new powers of the west built upon the Roman traditions until they evolved into a synthesis of Roman and Germanic cultures. Although these powers covered large territories, they did not have the great resources and bureaucracy of the Roman empire to control regions and localities. The ongoing invasions and boundary disputes usually meant a more risky and varying life than that under the empire. This meant that in general more power and responsibilities were left to local lords. On the other hand, it also meant more freedom, particularly in more remote areas.\n\nIn Italy, [[Theodoric the Great]] began the cultural romanization of the new world he had constructed. He made [[Ravenna]] a center of Romano-Greek culture of art and his court fostered a flowering of literature and philosophy in [[Latin]]. In Iberia, [[Chindasuinth|King Chindasuinth]] created the [[Visigothic Code]].\n<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=History of Theology: The Middle Ages|author1=Di Berardino, A.|author2=D'Onofrio, G.|author3=Studer, B.|date=2008|publisher=Liturgical Press|isbn=9780814659168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2o5V2GWlaFIC|page=26|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the feudal system, new princes and kings arose, the most powerful of which was arguably the Frankish ruler [[Charlemagne]]. In 800, Charlemagne, reinforced by his massive territorial conquests, was crowned Emperor of the Romans (Imperator Romanorum) by [[Pope Leo III]], effectively solidifying his power in western Europe.  Charlemagne's reign marked the beginning of a new Germanic Roman Empire in the west, the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Outside his borders, new forces were gathering. The [[Kievan Rus']] were marking out their territory, a [[Great Moravia]] was growing, while the [[Angles]] and the [[Saxons]] were securing their borders.\n\nFor the duration of the 6th century, the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was embroiled in a series of deadly conflicts, first with the Persian [[Sassanid Empire]] (see [[Roman\u2013Persian Wars]]), followed by the onslaught of the arising Islamic [[Caliphate]] ([[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]]). By 650, the provinces of [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Palestine and Syria]] were lost to the [[Rashidun army|Muslim forces]], followed by [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Hispania]] and [[History of Islam in southern Italy|southern Italy]] in the 7th and 8th centuries (see [[Muslim conquests]]). The Arab invasion from the east was stopped after the intervention of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] (see [[Tervel of Bulgaria]]).\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{Main article|Middle Ages|Medieval demography}}\nThe Middle Ages are commonly dated from the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]] (or by some scholars, before that) in the 5th century to the beginning of the [[early modern period]] in the 16th century, marked by the rise of [[nation state]]s, the division of Western Christianity in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the rise of [[humanism]] in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and the beginnings of European overseas expansion which allowed for the [[Columbian Exchange]].<ref>Susan Wise Bauer, ''The History of the Medieval World: From the Conversion of Constantine to the First Crusade'' (2010)</ref><ref>* {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd, ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA793|year=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=791\u201394}}</ref>\n\n===Byzantium===\n{{Main article|Byzantine Empire}}\n[[File:Hagia Sophia Southwestern entrance mosaics 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Constantine I]] and [[Justinian I]] offering their fealty to the Virgin Mary inside the [[Hagia Sophia]]]]\n\nMany consider Emperor [[Constantine I]] (reigned 306\u2013337) to be the first \"[[Byzantine Emperor]]\".

Others place it yet later in 476, when [[Romulus Augustulus]], traditionally considered the last western Emperor, was deposed, thus leaving sole imperial authority with the emperor in the [[Greek East]]. Others point to the reorganisation of the empire in the time of [[Heraclius]] (c. 620) when Latin titles and usages were officially replaced with Greek versions. In any case, the changeover was gradual and by 330, when Constantine inaugurated his new capital, the process of hellenization and increasing [[Christianisation]] was already under way. The Empire is generally considered to have ended after the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The [[Plague of Justinian]] was a [[pandemic]] that afflicted the [[Byzantine Empire]], including its capital [[Constantinople]], in the years 541\u2013542.

They landed at [[Gibraltar]] on 30 April and worked their way northward. Tariq's forces were joined the next year by those of his Arab superior, [[Musa ibn Nusair]]. During the eight-year campaign most of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] was brought under Muslim rule \u2013 save for small areas in the northwest ([[Asturias]]) and largely [[Basque people|Basque]] regions in the [[Pyrenees]]. In 711, [[Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] was very weakened because it was immersed in a serious internal crisis caused by a war of succession to the throne involving two Visigoth suitors. The Muslims took advantage of the crisis that crossed the [[Hispania|Hispano]]-[[Visigothic]] society to carry out their conquests. This territory, under the Arab name [[Al-Andalus]], became part of the expanding [[Umayyad]] empire.\n\nThe unsuccessful [[Siege of Constantinople (717\u2013718)|second siege of Constantinople]] (717) weakened the [[Umayyad|Umayyad dynasty]] and reduced their prestige. In 722 [[Don Pelayo]], a [[nobleman]] of Visigothic origin, formed an army of 300 [[Astures|Astur]] soldiers, to confront Munuza's Muslim troops. In the [[battle of Covadonga]], the Astures defeated the Arab-Moors, who decided to retire. The Christian victory marked the beginning of the [[Reconquista]] and the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], whose first sovereign was Don Pelayo. The conquerors intended to continue their expansion in Europe and move northeast across the Pyrenees, but were defeated by the [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] leader [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] in 732. The Umayyads were overthrown in 750 by the '[[Abb\u0101sids]],<ref>Joseph F. O\u00b4Callaghan, ''Reconquest and crusade in Medieval Spain'' (2002)</ref> and, in 756, the Umayyads established an [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba|independent emirate]] in the Iberian Peninsula.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of Medieval Europe|editor=George Holmes|isbn=0-19-820073-0|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|p=371}}</ref>\n\n====Feudal Christendom====\n{{Main article|Holy Roman Empire|Charlemagne|Christendom|Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba|Bulgarian Empire|Medieval England|Medieval Hungary|Medieval Poland|Kievan Rus'}}\n[[File:Europe 1000.jpg|thumb|300px|Europe in 1000, with most European states already formed]]\n[[File:HRE-at-its-peak.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Europe in 1204.]]\n\nThe [[Holy Roman Empire]] emerged around 800, as [[Charlemagne]], king of the [[Franks]], was crowned by the pope as emperor. His empire based in modern France, the [[Low Countries]] and Germany expanded into modern Hungary, Italy, [[Bohemia]], Lower Saxony and Spain. He and his father received substantial help from an alliance with the Pope, who wanted help against the [[Lombards]].<ref>Michael Frassetto, ''Early Medieval World, The: From the Fall of Rome to the Time of Charlemagne'' (2013)</ref>\n\nTo the east, [[Bulgaria]] was established in 681 and became the first [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] country. The powerful [[Bulgarian Empire]] was the main rival of Byzantium for control of the Balkans for centuries and from the 9th century became the cultural centre of Slavic Europe. The Empire created the [[Cyrillic script]] during the 10th century AD, at the [[Preslav Literary School]]. Two states, [[Great Moravia]] and [[Kievan Rus']], emerged among the Slavic peoples respectively in the 9th century. In the late 9th and 10th centuries, northern and western Europe felt the burgeoning power and influence of the [[Viking]]s who raided, traded, conquered and settled swiftly and efficiently with their advanced seagoing vessels such as the [[longship]]s. The [[Invasion#Magyar invasions of Europe|Hungarians]] pillaged mainland Europe, the [[Pechenegs]] raided Bulgaria, Rus States and the [[Arab]] states. In the 10th century independent kingdoms were established in Central Europe including Poland and the newly settled [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|Croatia]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] also appeared in the [[Balkans]]. The subsequent period, ending around 1000, saw the further growth of [[feudalism]], which weakened the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nIn eastern Europe, [[Volga Bulgaria]] became an Islamic state in 921, after [[Alm\u0131\u015f I]] converted to Islam under the missionary efforts of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]].<ref>Gerald Mako, \"The Islamization of the Volga Bulghars: A Question Reconsidered\", Archivum Eurasiae Medii Aevi 18, 2011, 199\u2013223.</ref>\n\nSlavery in the early medieval period had mostly died out in western Europe by about the year 1000&nbsp;AD, replaced by [[serfdom]]. It lingered longer in England and in peripheral areas linked to the Muslim world, where slavery continued to flourish. Church rules suppressed slavery of Christians. Most historians argue the transition was quite abrupt around 1000, but some see a gradual transition from about 300 to 1000.<ref>Seymour Drescher and Stanley L. Engerman, eds. ''A Historical Guide to World Slavery'' (1998) pp 197\u2013200</ref>\n\n===High Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|High Middle Ages}}\n[[File:Europe map 1092.PNG|thumb|left|250px|Europe in 1092]]\n[[File:First.Crusade.Map.jpg|thumb|Europe in 1097, as the [[First Crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]] commences]]\n\nThe slumber of the [[Early Middle Ages|Dark Ages]] was shaken by a renewed crisis in the Church. In 1054, the [[East\u2013West Schism]], an insoluble split, occurred between the two remaining Christian seats in [[Catholic Church|Rome]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul).\n\nThe High Middle Ages of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries show a [[Medieval demography|rapidly increasing population]] of Europe, which caused great social and political change from the preceding era. By 1250, the robust population increase greatly benefited the economy, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the 19th century.<ref>John H. Mundy, ''Europe in the high Middle Ages, 1150\u20131309'' (1973) [https://archive.org/details/europeinhighmidd00mund online]</ref>\n\nFrom about the year 1000 onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The [[Viking]]s had settled in Britain, Ireland, France and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their Scandinavian homelands. The [[Hungarian people|Magyars]] had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, the Roman Catholic [[Apostolic Kingdom]] of Hungary was recognised in central Europe. With the brief exception of the [[Mongol invasion of Europe|Mongol invasions]], major barbarian incursions ceased.\n\nIn the 11th century, populations north of the [[Alps]] began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the \"great clearances\", vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers in Europe, beyond the [[Elbe]] river, tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded [[Crusader states|European colonies]] in the [[Levant]], the majority of the [[Reconquista|Iberian Peninsula was conquered]] from the Muslims, and the [[Normans]] colonised southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.\n\nThe High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and [[Medieval art|artistic works]]. The most famous are the great cathedrals as expressions of [[Gothic architecture]], which evolved from [[Romanesque architecture]]. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in Western Europe and the ascent of the famous Italian [[city-state]]s, such as [[Florence]] and [[Venice]]. The influential popes of the Catholic Church called volunteer armies from across Europe to a series of [[Crusades]] against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]], who occupied the [[Holy Land]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[Aristotle]] led [[Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of [[Scholasticism]].\n\n====A divided church====\n{{Main article|East\u2013West Schism|Norman conquest of England}}\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry WillelmDux.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] depicts the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the events leading to it]]\n\nThe Great Schism between the Western (Catholic) and Eastern (Orthodox) Christian Churches was sparked in 1054 by [[Pope Leo IX]] asserting authority over three of the seats in the [[Pentarchy]], in Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria. Since the mid-8th century, the Byzantine Empire's borders had been shrinking in the face of Islamic expansion. [[Antioch]] had been wrested back into Byzantine control by 1045, but the resurgent power of the Roman successors in the West claimed a right and a duty for the lost seats in Asia and Africa. Pope Leo sparked a further dispute by defending the [[filioque]] clause in the [[Nicene Creed]] which the West had adopted customarily. The Orthodox today state that the XXVIIIth Canon of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] explicitly proclaimed the equality of the Bishops of Rome and Constantinople. The Orthodox also state that the Bishop of Rome has authority only over his own diocese and does not have any authority outside his diocese. There were other less significant catalysts for the Schism however, including variance over [[liturgy]]. The Schism of Roman Catholic and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] followed centuries of estrangement between the Latin and Greek worlds.\n\nFurther changes were set afoot with a redivision of power in Europe. [[William the Conqueror]], a [[Duke of Normandy]], invaded England in 1066. The Norman Conquest was a pivotal event in [[History of England|English history]] for several reasons. This linked England more closely with continental Europe through the introduction of a Norman aristocracy, thereby lessening Scandinavian influence. It created one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe and engendered a sophisticated governmental system. Being based on an island, moreover, England was to develop a powerful navy and trade relationships that would come to encompass a vast proportion of the world including India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and many key naval strategic points like [[Bermuda]], [[Suez]], Hong Kong and especially [[Gibraltar]]. These strategic advantages grew and were to prove decisive until after the [[Second World War]].\n\n====Holy wars====\n{{Main article|Crusades|Reconquista}}\n[[File:SiegeofAntioch.jpeg|thumb|The [[Siege of Antioch]], from a medieval miniature painting, during the [[First Crusade]]]]\n\nAfter the [[East\u2013West Schism]], [[Western Christianity]] was adopted by the newly created kingdoms of Central Europe: [[Poland]], Hungary and [[Bohemia]]. The Roman Catholic Church developed as a major power, leading to conflicts between the Pope and Emperor. The geographic reach of the Roman Catholic Church expanded enormously due to the conversions of pagan kings (Scandinavia, [[Lithuania]], Poland, Hungary), the Christian [[Reconquista]] of [[Al-Andalus]], and the [[crusades]]. Most of Europe was Roman Catholic in the 15th century.\n\nEarly signs of the rebirth of civilization in western Europe began to appear in the 11th century as trade started again in Italy, leading to the economic and cultural growth of independent [[city-state]]s such as [[Venice#History|Venice]] and [[History of Florence|Florence]]; at the same time, nation-states began to take form in places such as France, England, Spain, and Portugal, although the process of their formation (usually marked by rivalry between the monarchy, the aristocratic feudal lords and the church) actually took several centuries. These new nation-states began writing in their own cultural vernaculars, instead of the traditional [[Latin]]. Notable figures of this movement would include [[Dante Alighieri]] and [[Christine de Pizan]] (born Christina da Pizzano), the former writing in Italian, and the latter, although an Italian (Venice), relocated to France, writing in French. (See [[Reconquista]] for the latter two countries.) Elsewhere, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], essentially based in Germany and Italy, further fragmented into a myriad of feudal principalities or small city states, whose subjection to the emperor was only formal.\n\nThe 13th and 14th centuries, when the [[Mongol Empire]] came to power, is often called the ''Age of the Mongols''. Mongol armies expanded westward under the command of [[Batu Khan]]. Their western conquests included almost all of Russia (save [[Novgorod]], which became a vassal),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110427075859/https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/citd/RussianHeritage/4.PEAS/4.L/12.III.5.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2011 |title=The Destruction of Kiev |publisher=Tspace.library.utoronto.ca |accessdate=17 May 2012 }}</ref> the [[Kipchak-Cuman Confederation]], Hungary, and Poland (which had remained a sovereign state).

Most historians believe only his death prevented the complete conquest of Europe.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The areas of Eastern Europe and most of Central Asia that were under direct Mongol rule became known as the [[Golden Horde]].

The [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Brothers]] of the Sword were defeated by the Lithuanians, so in 1237 Gregory IX merged the remainder of the order into the Teutonic Order as the [[Livonian Order]]. By the middle of the century, the Teutonic Knights completed their conquest of the Prussians before conquering and converting the Lithuanians in the subsequent decades. The order also came into conflict with the Eastern Orthodox Church of the [[Pskov Republic|Pskov]] and [[Novgorod Republic]]s. In 1240 the Orthodox Novgorod army defeated the Catholic Swedes in the [[Battle of the Neva]], and, two years later, they defeated the Livonian Order in the [[Battle on the Ice]]. The [[Union of Krewo]] in 1386, bringing two major changes in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: [[Christianization of Lithuania|conversion to Catholicism]] and establishment of a [[dynastic union]] between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]] marked both the greatest territorial expansion of the Grand Duchy and the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] in 1410.\n\n===Late Middle Ages===\n{{Main article|Late Middle Ages|Lex mercatoria|Hundred Years' War|Fall of Constantinople}}\n[[File:Pestilence spreading 1347-1351 europe.png|thumb|right|The spread of the \"Black Death\" from 1347 to 1351 through Europe]]\n\nThe Late Middle Ages spanned the 14th and 15th centuries.<ref>Wallace K. Ferguson, ''Europe in transition, 1300\u20131520'' (1962) [https://archive.org/details/europeintransiti00ferg online].</ref> Around 1300, centuries of European prosperity and growth came to a halt. A series of famines and plagues, such as the [[Great Famine of 1315\u20131317]] and the [[Black Death]], killed people in a matter of days, reducing the population of some areas by half as many survivors fled. Kishlansky reports:\n:The Black Death touched every aspect of life, hastening a process of social, economic, and cultural transformation already underway.... Fields were abandoned, workplaces stood idle, international trade was suspended. Traditional bonds of kinship, village, and even religion were broken and the horrors of death, flight, and failed expectations. \"People cared no more for dead men than we care for dead goats,\" wrote one survivor.<ref>Mark Kishlansky et al. ''Civilization in the West: Volume 1 to 1715'' (5th ed. 2003) p. 316</ref>\n\nDepopulation caused labor to become scarcer; the survivors were better paid and peasants could drop some of the burdens of feudalism. There was also social unrest; France and England experienced serious peasant risings including the [[Jacquerie]] and the [[Peasants' Revolt]]. At the same time, the unity of the Catholic Church was shattered by the [[Western Schism|Great Schism]]. Collectively these events have been called the [[Crisis of the Late Middle Ages]].<ref>Cantor, p. 480.</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 14th century, the [[Baltic Sea]] became one of the most important [[trade route]]s. The [[Hanseatic League]], an alliance of trading cities, facilitated the absorption of vast areas of Poland, [[Lithuania]], and [[Terra Mariana|Livonia]] into trade with other European countries. This fed the growth of powerful states in this part of Europe including Poland-Lithuania, Hungary, Bohemia, and Muscovy later on. The conventional end of the [[Middle Ages]] is usually associated with the fall of the city of [[Constantinople]] and of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1453. The Turks made the city the capital of their [[Ottoman Empire]], which lasted until 1922 and included [[Egypt]], Syria, and most of the [[Balkans]]. The [[Ottoman wars in Europe]], also sometimes referred to as the Turkish wars, marked an essential part of the history of the continent as a whole.\n\n==Early modern Europe==\n{{Main article|Early modern Europe|Scientific revolution|International relations, 1648\u20131814}}\n\n[[File:Republik Venedig Handelswege01.png|thumb|[[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] (red) and [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] (green) maritime trade routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and [[Black Sea]]]]\n\nThe Early Modern period spans the centuries between the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Industrial Revolution]], roughly from 1500 to 1800, or from the discovery of the [[New World]] in 1492 to the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. The period is characterised by the rise to importance of science and increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], secularised civic politics and the [[nation state]]. [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began their rise, beginning in northern Italian republics such as [[Genoa]]. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. As such, the early modern period represents the decline and eventual disappearance, in much of the European sphere, of [[feudalism]], serfdom and the power of the Catholic Church. The period includes the [[Protestant Reformation]], the disastrous [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[European colonisation of the Americas]] and the [[European witch-hunts]].\n\n===Renaissance===\n{{Main article|Renaissance}}\n[[File:Pacioli.jpg|250px|thumb|upright|''[[Portrait of Luca Pacioli]]'', the founder of accounting, by [[Jacopo de' Barbari]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]]).]]\n\nDespite these crises, the 14th century was also a time of great progress within the arts and sciences. A renewed interest in ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] as well as more recent [[Arabic]] texts<ref>e.g. [[Ibn al-Shatir]]: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/227960 The Planetary Theory of Ibn al-Shatir: Latitudes of the Planets]</ref> led to what has later been termed the [[Italian Renaissance]].\n\nThe Renaissance was a cultural movement that profoundly affected European intellectual life in the [[early modern period]]. Beginning in Italy, and spreading to the north, west and [[middle Europe]] during a cultural lag of some two and a half centuries, its influence affected literature, philosophy, art, politics, science, history, religion, and other aspects of intellectual enquiry.\n\nThe Italian [[Petrarch]] (Francesco di Petracco), deemed the first full-blooded Humanist, wrote in the 1330s: \"I am alive now, yet I would rather have been born in another time.\" He was enthusiastic about Greek and Roman antiquity. In the 15th and 16th centuries the continuing enthusiasm for the ancients was reinforced by the feeling that the inherited culture was dissolving and here was a storehouse of ideas and attitudes with which to rebuild. [[Matteo Palmieri]] wrote in the 1430s: \"Now indeed may every thoughtful spirit thank god that it has been permitted to him to be born in a new age.\" The renaissance was born: a new age where learning was very important.\n\nThe Renaissance was inspired by the growth in study of Latin and Greek texts and the admiration of the Greco-Roman era as a golden age. This prompted many artists and writers to begin drawing from Roman and Greek examples for their works, but there was also much innovation in this period, especially by multi-faceted artists such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The Humanists saw their repossession of a great past as a Renaissance\u2014a rebirth of civilization itself.<ref>{{cite book|author=Robert A. Nisbet|title=History of the Idea of Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QDRWfZ9Ydw0C&pg=PA103|year=1980|publisher=Transaction Publishers|page=103}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Francesco Melzi - Portrait of Leonardo - WGA14795.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), famed for the diversity of his talents.]]\n\nImportant political precedents were also set in this period. [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]]'s political writing in ''[[The Prince]]'' influenced later absolutism and real-politik. Also important were the many patrons who ruled states and used the artistry of the Renaissance as a sign of their power.\n\nIn all, the Renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought\u2014the immediate past being too \"Gothic\" in language, thought and sensibility.\n\nDuring this period, Spain experienced the greatest epoch of cultural splendor in its history. This epoch is known as the [[Golden Age|Spanish Golden age]] and took place between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\n===Exploration and trade===\n{{Main article|Age of Discovery}}\n[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|[[Cantino planisphere]], 1502, earliest chart showing explorations by [[Vasco da Gama|Gama]], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]] and [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral|Cabral]]]]\n\nToward the end of the period, an era of discovery began. The growth of the [[Ottoman Empire]], culminating in the fall of Constantinople in 1453, cut off trading possibilities with the east. Western Europe was forced to discover new trading routes, as happened with Columbus' travel to the Americas in 1492, and [[Vasco da Gama]]'s circumnavigation of [[Indian subcontinent|India]] and Africa in 1498.\n\nThe numerous wars did not prevent European states from exploring and conquering wide portions of the world, from Africa to Asia and the newly discovered Americas. In the 15th century, Portugal led the way in geographical exploration along the coast of Africa in search of a maritime route to India, followed by Spain near the close of the 15th century, dividing their exploration of the world according to the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] in 1494.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |title=kwabs.com |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215021/http://www.kwabs.com/tordesillas_treaty.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}</ref> They were the first states to set up colonies in America and European [[factory (trading post)|trading posts (factories)]] along the shores of Africa and Asia, establishing the first direct European diplomatic contacts with Southeast Asian states in 1511, China in 1513 and Japan in 1542. In 1552, Russian tsar [[Ivan the Terrible]] conquered two major [[Tatar]] khanates, the [[Khanate of Kazan]] and the [[Astrakhan Khanate]]. The [[Yermak Timofeyevich|Yermak]]'s voyage of 1580 led to the annexation of the Tatar [[Siberian Khanate]] into Russia, and the Russians would soon after conquer the rest of [[Siberia]], steadily expanding to the east and south over the next centuries. Oceanic explorations soon followed by France, England and the Netherlands, who explored the Portuguese and Spanish trade routes into the Pacific Ocean, reaching Australia in 1606<ref>MacKnight, CC (1976). ''The Voyage to Marege: Macassan Trepangers in Northern Australia''. [[Melbourne University Publishing|Melbourne University Press]].</ref> and New Zealand in 1642.\n\n===Reformation===\n{{Main article|Protestant Reformation}}\n[[File:95Thesen.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Ninety-Five Theses]] of German monk [[Martin Luther]], which criticized the Catholic Church]]\n[[File:Europe map 1648.PNG|left|thumb|350px|Map of Europe in 1648]]\n\nWith the development of the [[printing press]], new ideas spread throughout Europe and challenged traditional doctrines in science and theology. Simultaneously, the [[Protestant Reformation]] under German [[Martin Luther]] questioned Papal authority. The most common dating of the Reformation begins in 1517, when Luther published ''[[The Ninety-Five Theses]]'', and concludes in 1648 with the [[Treaty of Westphalia]] that ended years of [[European wars of religion|European religious wars]].<ref>Euan Cameron, ''The European Reformation'' (1991)</ref>\n\nDuring this period corruption in the Catholic Church led to a sharp backlash in the [[Protestant Reformation]]. It gained many followers especially among princes and kings seeking a stronger state by ending the influence of the Catholic Church. Figures other than [[Martin Luther]] began to emerge as well like [[John Calvin]] whose [[Calvinism]] had influence in many countries and King [[Henry VIII of England]] who broke away from the Catholic Church in England and set up the [[Anglican Church]]; his daughter [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] finished the organization of the church. These religious divisions brought on a wave of wars inspired and driven by religion but also by the ambitious monarchs in Western Europe who were becoming more centralised and powerful.\n\nThe Protestant Reformation also led to a strong reform movement in the Catholic Church called the [[Counter-Reformation]], which aimed to reduce corruption as well as to improve and strengthen Catholic dogma. Two important groups in the Catholic Church who emerged from this movement were the [[Jesuits]], who helped keep Spain, Portugal, Poland and other European countries within the Catholic fold, and the Oratorians of [[Saint Philip Neri]], who ministered to the faithful in Rome, restoring their confidence in the Church of Jesus Christ that subsisted substantially in the Church of Rome. Still, the Catholic Church was somewhat weakened by the Reformation, portions of Europe were no longer under its sway and kings in the remaining Catholic countries began to take control of the church institutions within their kingdoms.\n\nUnlike many European countries, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and Hungary were more tolerant. While still enforcing the predominance of Catholicism, they continued to allow the large religious minorities to maintain their faiths, traditions and customs. The Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth became divided among Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Jews and a small Muslim population.\n\nAnother important development in this period was the growth of pan-European sentiments. Em\u00e9ric Cruc\u00e9 (1623) came up with the idea of the [[European Council]], intended to end wars in Europe; attempts to create lasting peace were no success, although all European countries (except the Russian and Ottoman Empires, regarded as foreign) agreed to make peace in 1518 at the [[Treaty of London (1518)|Treaty of London]]. Many wars broke out again in a few years. The Reformation also made European peace impossible for many centuries.\n\n[[File:Europe As A Queen Sebastian Munster 1570.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Europa regina]], 1570 print by [[Sebastian M\u00fcnster]] of [[Basel]]]]\n\nAnother development was the idea of 'European superiority'. The ideal of civilisation was taken over from the ancient Greeks and Romans: Discipline, education and living in the city were required to make people civilised; Europeans and non-Europeans were judged for their civility, and Europe regarded itself as superior to other continents. There was a movement by some such as [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne]] that regarded the non-Europeans as a better, more natural and primitive people. Post services were founded all over Europe, which allowed a [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]] interconnected network of intellectuals across Europe, despite religious divisions. However, the Roman Catholic Church banned many leading scientific works; this led to an intellectual advantage for Protestant countries, where the banning of books was regionally organised. [[Francis Bacon]] and other advocates of science tried to create unity in Europe by focusing on the unity in nature.<sup>[[#Notes|1]]</sup> In the 15th century, at the end of the Middle Ages, powerful sovereign states were appearing, built by the [[New Monarchs]] who were centralising power in France, England, and Spain. On the other hand, the Parliament in the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] grew in power, taking legislative rights from the Polish king. The new state power was contested by parliaments in other countries especially England. New kinds of states emerged which were co-operation agreements among territorial rulers, cities, farmer republics and knights.\n\n[[File:Alberico Gentili.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alberico Gentili]], the Father of international law.]]\n\n===Mercantilism and colonial expansion===\n{{Main article|Mercantilism}}\n[[File:Colonisation2.gif|thumb|left|Animated map showing the evolution of [[Colonial empire]]s from 1492 to the present]]\n\nThe [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] states (Spain and Portugal) were able to dominate [[New World]] (American) colonial activity in the 16th century. The Spanish constituted the first global empire and during the 16th century and the first half of the 17th century, Spain was the most powerful nation in the world, but was increasingly challenged by [[British colonisation of the Americas|British]], [[French colonisation of the Americas|French]], and the short-lived [[New Netherland|Dutch]] and [[New Sweden|Swedish]] colonial efforts of the 17th and 18th centuries. New forms of trade and expanding horizons made new forms of [[Federalism|government]], [[Constitutionalism|law]] and [[Mercantilism|eco]] [[Free market|nomics]] necessary.\n\nColonial expansion continued in the following centuries (with some setbacks, such as successful wars of independence in the [[American Revolution|British American colonies]] and then later [[Haitian Revolution|Haiti]], [[Mexican War of Independence|Mexico]], [[Argentine War of Independence|Argentina]], [[Brazilian Independence|Brazil]], and [[Latin American wars of independence|others]] amid European turmoil of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; Haiti unique in abolishing slavery). Spain had control of a large part of North America, all of Central America and a great part of South America, the Caribbean and the [[Philippines]]; Britain took the whole of Australia and New Zealand, most of India, and large parts of Africa and North America; France held parts of Canada and India (nearly all of which was lost to Britain [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|in 1763]]), [[French Indochina|Indochina]], large parts of Africa and the Caribbean islands; the Netherlands gained the [[Indies|East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]) and islands in the Caribbean; Portugal obtained Brazil and several territories in Africa and Asia; and later, powers such as Germany, Belgium, Italy and Russia acquired further colonies.\n\nThis expansion helped the economy of the countries owning them. [[Mercantilism|Trade]] flourished, because of the minor stability of the empires. By the late 16th century, American silver accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Conquest in the Americas |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQDCbGf?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761575057_13/spain.html |archivedate=31 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref> The European countries fought wars that were largely paid for by the money coming in from the colonies.

In addition, there were secessions and upheavals in several parts of the Spanish empire, the world's first global empire. In Britain the entire Stuart monarchy (England, Scotland, Ireland, and its North American colonies) rebelled. Political insurgency and a spate of popular revolts seldom equalled shook the foundations of most states in Europe and Asia. More wars took place around the world in the mid-17th century than in almost any other period of recorded history. The crises spread far beyond Europe\u2014for example Ming China, the most populous state in the world, collapsed. Across the Northern Hemisphere, the mid-17th century experienced almost unprecedented death rates. Geoffrey Parker, a British historian, suggests that environmental factors may have been in part to blame, especially global cooling.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, \"Crisis and Catastrophe: The Global Crisis of the Seventeenth Century Reconsidered,\" ''American Historical Review'' (2008) 113#4 pp. 1053\u20131079.</ref><ref>J.

The expanding colonial frontiers resulted in a [[Commercial Revolution]]. The period is noted for the rise of modern science and the application of its findings to technological improvements, which animated the [[Industrial Revolution]] after 1750.\n\nThe Reformation had profound effects on the unity of Europe. Not only were nations divided one from another by their religious orientation, but some states were torn apart internally by religious strife, avidly fostered by their external enemies. France suffered this fate in the 16th century in the series of conflicts known as the [[French Wars of Religion]], which ended in the triumph of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon Dynasty]]. England avoided this fate for a while and settled down under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] to a moderate [[Anglicanism]]. Much of modern-day Germany was made up of numerous small sovereign states under the theoretical framework of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], which was further divided along internally drawn sectarian lines. The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] is notable in this time for its [[religious tolerance|religious indifference]] and a general immunity to the horrors of European religious strife.<!--this paragraph is still pretty bad-->\n\n====Thirty Years' War 1618\u20131648====\nThe [[Thirty Years' War]] was fought between 1618 and 1648, across Germany and neighboring areas, and involved most of the major European powers except England and Russia.<ref>Peter H. Wilson, ''Europe's Tragedy: A History of the Thirty Years War'' (2009)</ref> Beginning as a religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics in [[Bohemia]], it quickly developed into a general war involving Catholics versus Protestants for the most part. The major impact of the war, in which [[mercenary]] armies were extensively used, was the devastation of entire regions scavenged bare by the foraging armies. Episodes of widespread famine and disease, and the breakup of family life, devastated the population of the German states and, to a lesser extent, the [[Low Countries]], Bohemia and Italy, while bankrupting many of the regional powers involved. Between one-fourth and one-third of the German population perished from direct military causes or from disease and starvation, as well as postponed births.<ref>Henry Kamen, \"The Economic and Social Consequences of the Thirty Years' War,\" ''Past and Present'' (1968) 39#1 pp 44\u201361 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/649855 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n[[File:Herman Moll Map of Europe.jpg|thumb|left|After the [[Peace of Westphalia]], Europe's borders were still stable in 1708]]\n\nAfter the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the war in favour of nations deciding their own religious allegiance, [[Political absolutism|absolutism]] became the norm of the continent, while parts of Europe experimented with constitutions foreshadowed by the [[English Civil War]] and particularly the [[Glorious Revolution]]. European military conflict did not cease, but had less disruptive effects on the lives of Europeans. In the advanced northwest, [[the Enlightenment]] gave a philosophical underpinning to the new outlook, and the continued spread of literacy, made possible by the [[printing press]], created new secular forces in thought.\n\n[[File:Map of Europe in 1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres.JPG|thumb|300px|right|Map of Europe in [[1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World in Hemispheres|1794 Samuel Dunn Map of the World]]]]\n\nFrom the [[Union of Krewo]] (1385) central and eastern Europe was dominated by [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries Central and Eastern Europe was an arena of conflict for domination of the continent between Sweden, the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] continued dominance central and eastern Europe until series of wars: [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u201367)|Russo-Polish War]] and the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]]. This period saw a gradual decline of these three powers which were eventually replaced by new enlightened absolutist monarchies: Russia, Prussia and Austria. By the turn of the 19th century they had become new powers, having [[Partitions of Poland|divided Poland]] between themselves, with Sweden and Turkey having experienced substantial territorial losses to Russia and Austria respectively as well as pauperisation.\n\n====War of the Spanish Succession====\nThe [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701\u20131715) was a major war with France opposed by a coalition of England, the Netherlands, the Austrian Empire, and Prussia. [[John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough|Duke of Marlborough]]  commander the English and Dutch victory at the [[Battle Blenheim]] in 1704. The main issue was whether France under King Louis XIV would take control of Spain's very extensive possessions and thereby become by far the dominant power, or be forced to share power with other major nations.  After initial allied successes, the long war produced a military stalemate and ended with the [[Treaty of Utrecht]], which was based on a balance of power in Europe.  Historian [[Russell Weigley]] argues that the many wars almost never accomplished more than they cost.<ref>Russell Weigley,  ''The Age of Battles: The Quest for Decisive Warfare from Breitenfeld to Waterloo'' (1991).</ref> British historian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:\n:That Treaty [of Utrecht], which ushered in the stable and characteristic period of Eighteenth-Century civilization, marked the end of danger to Europe from the old French monarchy, and it marked a change of no less significance to the world at large, \u2014 the maritime, commercial and financial supremacy of Great Britain.<ref>G.M. Trevelyan, ''A shortened history of England'' (1942) p 363.</ref>\n\n====Prussia====\n[[Frederick the Great]], king of Prussia 1740\u201386, modernized the Prussian army, introduced new tactical and strategic concepts, fought mostly successful wars and doubled the size of Prussia. Frederick had a rationale based on Enlightenment thought: he fought total wars for limited objectives. The goal was to convince rival kings that it was better to negotiate and make peace than to fight him.<ref>{{cite book|author=Paul M.

Russia boasted a large and powerful army, a very large and complex internal bureaucracy, and a splendid court that rivaled Paris and London. However the government was living far beyond its means and seized Church lands, leaving organized religion in a weak condition.

C. Jacob, ''The Enlightenment: A Brief History with Documents'' (2000)</ref>  It sought to analyze and reform society using reason, to challenge ideas grounded in tradition and faith, and to advance knowledge through the [[scientific method]].

Some Enlightenment thinkers collaborated with [[Enlightened absolutism|Enlightened despots]], absolutist rulers who attempted to forcibly impose some of the new ideas about government into practice. The ideas of the Enlightenment exerted significant influence on the culture, politics, and governments of Europe.<ref>Geoffrey Bruun, ''The enlightened despots'' (1967).</ref>\n\nOriginating in the 17th century, it was sparked by philosophers [[Francis Bacon]] (1562\u20131626), [[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632\u20131677), [[John Locke]] (1632\u20131704), [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706), [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778), [[Francis Hutcheson (philosopher)|Francis Hutcheson]], (1694\u20131746), [[David Hume]] (1711\u20131776) and physicist [[Isaac Newton]] (1643\u20131727).<ref>Sootin, Harry. \"Isaac Newton.\" New York, Messner (1955).</ref> Ruling princes often endorsed and fostered these figures and even attempted to apply their ideas of government in what was known as [[enlightened absolutism]]. The [[Scientific Revolution]] is closely tied to the Enlightenment, as its discoveries overturned many traditional concepts and introduced new perspectives on nature and man's place within it. The Enlightenment flourished until about 1790\u20131800, at which point the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason, gave way to [[Romanticism]], which placed a new emphasis on emotion; a [[Counter-Enlightenment]] began to increase in prominence. The Romantics argued that the Enlightenment was [[reductionistic]] insofar as it had largely ignored the forces of imagination, mystery, and sentiment.<ref name=\"Casey\">{{cite web|last=Casey |first=Christopher |date=30 October 2008 |title=\"Grecian Grandeurs and the Rude Wasting of Old Time\": Britain, the Elgin Marbles, and Post-Revolutionary Hellenism |work=Foundations.

Technological advancements, most notably the invention of the steam engine by Scottish engineer James Watt, were major catalysts in the industrialisation of Britain and, later, the wider world. It started in England and Scotland in the mid-18th century with the mechanisation of the textile industries, the development of iron-making techniques and the increased use of refined coal. Trade expansion was enabled by the introduction of [[canal]]s, improved roads and railways.

The French Revolution was by far the most momentous upheaval of the whole revolutionary age. It replaced the \"old regime\" with \"modern society,\" and at its extreme phase became very radical, so much so that all later revolutionary movements have looked back to it as a predecessor to themselves.... From the 1760s to 1848, the role of France was decisive.<ref>R.R. Palmer and Joel Colton, A History of the Modern World (5th ed. 1978), p. 341</ref>\n\nThe era of the French Revolution and the subsequent Napoleonic wars was a difficult time for monarchs. Tsar [[Paul I of Russia]] was assassinated; King [[Louis XVI of France]] was executed, as was his queen [[Marie Antoinette]]. Furthermore, kings [[Charles IV of Spain]], [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]] and [[Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden]] were deposed as were ultimately the Emperor Napoleon and all of the relatives he had installed on various European thrones. King [[Frederick William III of Prussia]] and Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II of Austria]] barely clung to their thrones.

After repeated failed attempts at financial reform, King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] had to convene the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]], a representative body of the country made up of three estates: the clergy, the nobility, and the commoners. The third estate, joined by members of the other two, declared itself to be a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] and swore an [[Tennis Court Oath|oath]] not to dissolve until France had a constitution and created, in July, the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. At the same time the people of Paris revolted, famously storming the [[Bastille]] prison on 14 July 1789.\n\nAt the time the assembly wanted to create a [[constitutional monarchy]], and over the following two years passed various laws including the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], the [[Abolition of feudalism in France|abolition of feudalism]], and a [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy|fundamental change]] in the relationship between France and Rome. At first the king agreed with these changes and enjoyed reasonable popularity with the people. As anti-royalism increased along with threat of foreign invasion, the king tried to flee and join France's enemies. He was captured and on 12 January 1793, having been convicted of treason, he was guillotined.\n\nOn 20 September 1792 the [[National Convention]] abolished the monarchy and declared France a republic. Due to the emergency of [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]], the National Convention created the [[Committee of Public Safety]], controlled by [[Maximilien de Robespierre]] of the [[Jacobin Club]], to act as the country's executive. Under Robespierre, the committee initiated the [[Reign of Terror]], during which up to 40,000 people were executed in Paris, mainly nobles and those convicted by the [[Revolutionary Tribunal]], often on the flimsiest of evidence. Internal tensions at Paris drove the Committee towards increasing assertions of radicalism and increasing suspicions, fueling new terror: A few months into this phase, more and more prominent revolutionaries were being sent to the guillotine by Robespierre and his faction, for example [[Madame Roland]] and [[Georges Danton]]. Elsewhere in the country, counter-revolutionary [[war in the Vend\u00e9e|insurrections]] were brutally suppressed. The regime was overthrown in the [[Thermidorian Reaction|coup of 9 Thermidor]] (27 July 1794) and Robespierre was executed. The regime which followed ended the Terror and relaxed Robespierre's more extreme policies.\n\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo 1815.PNG|left|thumb|The [[Battle of Waterloo]], where [[Napoleon]] was defeated by the Seventh Coalition in 1815]]\n\n===Napoleon===\n[[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] was one of the world's most famous soldiers and statesmen, leading France to great victories over numerous European enemies. Despite modest origins he became Emperor and restructured much of European diplomacy, politics and law, until he was forced to abdicate in 1814. His 100-day comeback in 1815 failed at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], and he died in exile on a remote island, remembered as a great hero by many Frenchmen and as a great villain by British and other enemies.\n\nNapoleon, despite his youth, was France's most successful general in the Revolutionary wars, having conquered large parts of [[Italy]] and forced the Austrians to sue for peace. In 1799 on [[18 Brumaire]] (9 November) he overthrew the feeble government, replacing it with the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], which he dominated. He gained popularity in France by restoring the Church, keeping taxes low, centralizing power in Paris, and winning glory on the battlefield. In 1804 he crowned himself [[First French Empire|Emperor]]. In 1805, Napoleon planned to invade Britain, but a renewed British alliance with Russia and Austria ([[Third Coalition]]), forced him to turn his attention towards the continent, while at the same time the French fleet was demolished by the British at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], ending any plan to invade Britain. On 2 December 1805, Napoleon defeated a numerically superior Austro-Russian army at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], forcing Austria's withdrawal from the coalition (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]) and dissolving the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In 1806, a [[Fourth Coalition]] was set up. On 14 October Napoleon defeated the Prussians at the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], marched through Germany and defeated the Russians on 14 June 1807 at [[Battle of Friedland|Friedland]]. The [[Treaties of Tilsit]] divided Europe between France and Russia and created the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].\n\n[[File:Berezyna.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's army at the retreat from [[Russia]] at the [[Berezina]] river]]\n\nOn 12 June 1812 Napoleon [[French invasion of Russia|invaded Russia]] with a [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] of nearly 700,000 troops. After the measured victories at [[Battle of Smolensk (1812)|Smolensk]] and [[Battle of Borodino|Borodino]] Napoleon occupied Moscow, only to find it burned by the retreating Russian army. He was forced to withdraw. On the march back his army was harassed by [[Cossacks]], and suffered disease and starvation. Only 20,000 of his men survived the campaign. By 1813 the tide had begun to turn from Napoleon. Having been defeated by a [[Sixth Coalition|seven nation army]] at the [[Battle of Leipzig]] in October 1813, he was forced to abdicate after the [[Six Days' Campaign]] and the occupation of Paris. Under the Treaty of Fontainebleau he was exiled to the island of [[Elba]]. He returned to France on 1 March 1815 (see [[Hundred Days]]), raised an army, but was finally defeated by a British and Prussian force at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815 and exiled to a small British island in the South Atlantic.\n\n====Impact of the French Revolution====\n{{main article|Influence of the French Revolution}}\nRoberts finds that the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, from 1793 to 1815, caused 4&nbsp;million deaths (of whom 1&nbsp;million were civilians); 1.4&nbsp;million were French deaths.<ref>Andrew Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,'\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref>\n\nOutside France the Revolution had a major impact. Its ideas became widespread. Roberts argues that Napoleon was responsible for key ideas of the modern world, so that, \"meritocracy, equality before the law, property rights, religious toleration, modern secular education, sound finances, and so on-were protected, consolidated, codified, and geographically extended by Napoleon during his 16 years of power.\"<ref>Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised of divorce, closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]] and made Jews equal to everyone else. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] was proclaimed for all men.<ref>Robert R. Palmer and Joel Colton,  ''A History of the Modern World'' (New York: McGraw Hill, 1995), pp. 428\u20139.</ref>\n\nIn foreign affairs, the French Army down to 1812 was quite successful. Roberts says that Napoleon fought 60 battles, losing only seven.<ref>Andrew Roberts, \"Why Napoleon merits the title 'the Great,\" ''BBC History Magazine''  (1 November 2014)</ref>  France conquered Belgium and turned it into another province of France. It conquered the Netherlands, and made it a puppet state. It took control of the German areas on the left bank of the Rhine River and set up a puppet regime. It conquered Switzerland and most of Italy, setting up a series of puppet states. The result was glory for France, and an infusion of much needed money from the conquered lands, which also provided direct support to the French Army. However the enemies of France, led by Britain and funded by the inexhaustible British Treasury, formed a Second Coalition in 1799 (with Britain joined by Russia, the Ottoman Empire and Austria). It scored a series of victories that rolled back French successes, and trapped the French Army in Egypt. Napoleon himself slipped through the British blockade in October 1799, returning to Paris, where he overthrew the government and made himself the ruler.<ref>William Doyle, ''The Oxford History of the French Revolution'' (1989) pp 341\u201368</ref><ref>Steven T. Ross, ''European Diplomatic History, 1789\u20131815: France Against Europe'' (1969)</ref>\n\nNapoleon conquered most of [[Italy]] in the name of the French Revolution in 1797\u201399. He consolidated old units and split up Austria's holdings. He set up a series of new republics, complete with new codes of law and abolition of old feudal privileges. Napoleon's [[Cisalpine Republic]] was centered on Milan; Genoa became a republic; the Roman Republic was formed as well as the small [[Ligurian Republic]] around Genoa. The [[Parthenopean Republic|Neapolitan Republic]] was formed around Naples, but it lasted only five months. He later formed the [[Kingdom of Italy]], with his brother as King. In addition, France turned the Netherlands into the [[Batavian Republic]], and Switzerland into the [[Helvetic Republic]]. All these new countries were satellites of France, and had to pay large subsidies to Paris, as well as provide military support for Napoleon's wars. Their political and administrative systems were modernized, the metric system introduced, and trade barriers reduced. Jewish ghettos were abolished. Belgium and Piedmont became integral parts of France.<ref>Alexander Grab, ''Napoleon and the Transformation of Europe'' (2003) pp 62\u201365, 78\u201379, 88\u201396, 115\u201317, 154\u201359</ref>\n\nMost of the new nations were abolished and returned to prewar owners in 1814. However, Artz emphasizes the benefits the Italians gained from the French Revolution:\n:For nearly two decades the [[Italians]] had the excellent codes of law, a fair system of taxation, a better economic situation, and more religious and intellectual toleration than they had known for centuries.... Everywhere old physical, economic, and intellectual barriers had been thrown down and the Italians had begun to be aware of a common nationality.<ref>Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction and Revolution: 1814\u20131832 '' (1934) pp 142\u201343</ref>\n\nLikewise in [[History of Switzerland|Switzerland]] the long-term impact of the French Revolution has been assessed by Martin:\n:It proclaimed the equality of citizens before the law, equality of languages, freedom of thought and faith; it created a Swiss citizenship, basis of our modern nationality, and the separation of powers, of which the old regime had no conception; it suppressed internal tariffs and other economic restraints; it unified weights and measures, reformed civil and penal law, authorized mixed marriages (between Catholics and Protestants), suppressed torture and improved justice; it developed education and public works.<ref>William Martin, ''Histoire de la Suisse'' (Paris, 1926), pp 187\u201388, quoted in Crane Brinson, ''A Decade of Revolution: 1789\u20131799'' (1934) p 235</ref>\n\nThe greatest impact came of course in France itself. In addition to effects similar to those in Italy and Switzerland, France saw the introduction of the principle of legal equality, and the downgrading of the once powerful and rich Catholic Church to just a bureau controlled by the government. Power became centralized in Paris, with its strong bureaucracy and an army supplied by conscripting all young men. French politics were permanently polarized\u2014new names were given, \"left\" and \"right\" for the supporters and opponents of the principles of the Revolution.\n\nBritish historian Max Hastings says there is no question that as a military genius Napoleon ranks with Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar in greatness. However, in the political realm, historians debate whether Napoleon was \"an enlightened despot who laid the foundations of modern Europe or, instead, a megalomaniac who wrought greater misery than any man before the coming of Hitler\".<ref>Max Hastings,  \"Everything Is Owed to Glory,\" [https://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-napoleon-a-life-by-andrew-roberts-1414788232?tesla=y&mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl&mg=reno64-wsj&url=https://www.wsj.com/article/SB12003192308051073864504580228211018002950.html?mod=WSJEUROPE_hpp_sections_ukintl ''Wall Street Journal '' 31 October 2014]</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{main article|Christianity in the 19th century}}\n\n====Protestantism====\nHistorian [[Kenneth Scott Latourette]] argues that the outlook for Protestantism at the start of the 19th century was discouraging. It was a regional religion based in northwestern Europe, with an outpost in the sparsely settled United States. It was closely allied with government, as in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Prussia, and especially Great Britain. The alliance came at the expense of independence, as the government made the basic policy decisions, down to such details as the salaries of ministers and location of new churches. The dominant intellectual currents of the Enlightenment promoted rationalism, and most Protestant leaders preached a sort of deism. Intellectually, the new methods of historical and anthropological study undermine automatic acceptance of biblical stories, as did the sciences of geology and biology. Industrialization was a strongly negative factor, as workers who moved to the city seldom joined churches. The gap between the church and the unchurched grew rapidly, and secular forces, based both in socialism and liberalism undermine the prestige of religion.  Despite the negative forces, Protestantism demonstrated a striking vitality by 1900. Shrugging off Enlightenment rationalism, Protestants embraced [[romanticism]], with the stress on the personal and the invisible. Entirely fresh ideas as expressed by [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]], [[Soren Kierkegaard]], [[Albrecht Ritschl]] and [[Adolf von Harnack]] restored the intellectual power of theology. There was more attention to historic creeds such as the Augsburg, the Heidelberg, and the Westminster confessions.  In England, Anglicans emphasize the historically Catholic components of their heritage, as the High Church element reintroduced vestments and incense into their rituals.  The stirrings of [[pietism]] on the Continent, and [[evangelicalism]] in Britain expanded enormously, leading the devout away from an emphasis on formality and ritual and toward an inner sensibility toward personal relationship to Christ.  Social activities, in education and in opposition to social vices such as slavery, alcoholism and poverty provided new opportunities for social service. Above all, worldwide missionary activity became a highly prized goal, proving quite successful in close cooperation with the imperialism of the British, German, and Dutch empires.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches'' (1959) pp 428\u201331</ref>\n\n===Nations rising===\n\n{{Main article|International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|Serbian Revolution|Italian unification||Revolutions of 1848|Greek War of Independence}}\n[[File:Maerz1848 berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Cheering the [[Revolutions of 1848]] in Berlin]]\n\n====Emerging nationalism====\n{{further information|Nationalism}}\nThe political development of nationalism and the push for [[popular sovereignty]] culminated with the ethnic/national revolutions of Europe.

In the 1790s, Germany, Russia and Austria [[Partitions of Poland|partitioned Poland]]. Napoleon set up the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a new Polish state that ignited a spirit of nationalism. Russia took it over in 1815 as [[Congress Poland]] with the tsar as King of Poland. Large-scale nationalist revolts erupted [[November Uprising|in 1830]] and [[January Uprising|1863\u201364]]  but were harshly crushed by Russia, which tried to Russify the Polish language, culture and religion. The collapse of the Russian Empire in the First World War enabled the major powers to reestablish an independent Poland, which survived until 1939.  Meanwhile, Poles in areas controlled by Germany moved into heavy industry but their religion came under attack by Bismarck in the [[Kulturkampf]] of the 1870s.  The Poles joined German Catholics in a well-organized new [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and defeated Bismarck politically.

Voting reforms extended the franchise to previously uneducated element, and a strong sentiment among the elites so necessity for compulsory public education so that the new electorate could understand and handle its duties. Every country developed a sense of national origins \u2013 the historical accuracy was less important than the motivation toward patriotism. Universal compulsory education was extended as well to girls, at least at the elementary level. By the 1890s, strong movements emerged in some countries, including France, Germany and the United States, to extend compulsory education to the secondary level.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ellwood Patterson Cubberley|title=The History of Education: Educational Practice and Progress Considered as a Phase of the Development and Spread of Western Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rq8VAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA711|year=1920|pages=711\u201323}}</ref>\n====Ideological coalitions====\nAfter the defeat of revolutionary France, the other great powers tried to restore the situation which existed before 1789. In 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]], the major powers of Europe managed to produce a peaceful [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] among the various European empires. This was known as the [[Metternich]] system.  The powerbase of their support was the aristocracy, with its great landed wealth and control of the government, the church, and the military in most countries. However, their efforts were unable to stop the spread of revolutionary movements: the middle classes had been deeply influenced by the ideals of the French revolution, the [[Industrial Revolution]] brought important economical and social changes.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Viereck|title=Conservative Thinkers: From John Adams to Winston Churchill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qXxHHXwJT28C&pg=PA71|year=1978|pages=71\u201377}}</ref> \n\nRadical intellectuals looked to the working classes for a base for socialist, communist and [[anarchism|anarchistic]] ideas.

Aristocratic elements concentrated in government service, the military and the established churches. Nationalist movements (in Germany, Italy, Poland, Hungary, and elsewhere) called upon the \"racial\" unity (which usually meant a common language and an imagined common ethnicity) to seek national unification and/or liberation from foreign rule. As a result, the period between 1815 and 1871 saw a large number of revolutionary attempts and independence wars. Greece successfully revolted against Ottoman rule in the 1820s. European diplomats and intellectuals saw the Greek struggle for independence, with its accounts of Turkish atrocities, in a romantic light.<ref>{{cite book|author=Pamela Pilbeam|title=The Middle Classes in Europe, 1789-1914: France, Germany, Italy, and Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZkZdDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA240|year=1990|page=240}}</ref>\n\n====France under Napoleon III====\n[[Napoleon III]], nephew of Napoleon I, returned to France from exile in 1848, bringing a famous name that promised to stabilize the chaotic political situation.

There were rivals on four sides, its finances were unstable, the population was fragmented into multiple ethnicities and languages that served as the bases for separatist nationalisms. It had a large army with good forts, but its industrial base was thin. Its naval resources were so minimal that it did not attempt to build an overseas empire. It did have the advantage of good diplomats, typified by [[Klemens von Metternich|Metternich (Foreign Minister 1809-1848, Prime Minister, 1821-1848))]]. They employed a grand strategy for survival that balanced out different forces, set up buffer zones, and kept the Habsburg empire going despite wars with the Ottomans, Frederick the Great, Napoleon and Bismarck, until the final disaster of the First World War.

The initial impulse behind these dispersed maritime empires and those that followed was trade, driven by the new ideas and the capitalism that grew out of the [[Renaissance]]. Both the [[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Spanish Empire]] quickly grew into the first global political and economic systems with territories spread around the world.\n\nSubsequent major European colonial empires included the [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], and [[British Empire|British]] empires. The latter, consolidated during the period of British maritime hegemony in the 19th century, became the largest empire in history because of the improved ocean transportation technologies of the time as well as electronic communication through the telegraph, cable, and radio. At its height in 1920, the British Empire covered a quarter of the Earth's land area and comprised a quarter of its population. Other European countries, such as [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium]], [[German colonial empire|Germany]], and [[Italian colonial empire|Italy]], pursued colonial empires as well (mostly in Africa), but they were smaller. Ignoring the oceans, Russia built its [[Russian Empire]] through conquest by land in Eastern Europe, and Asia.\n\nBy the mid-19th century, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had declined enough to become a target for other global powers (see [[History of the Balkans]]). This instigated the [[Crimean War]] in 1854 and began a tenser period of minor clashes among the globe-spanning empires of Europe that eventually set the stage for the [[First World War]]. In the second half of the 19th century, the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] and the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] carried out a series of wars that resulted in the creation of [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] as nation-states, significantly changing the balance of power in Europe. From 1870, [[Otto von Bismarck]] engineered a German hegemony of Europe that put France in a critical situation. It slowly rebuilt its relationships, seeking alliances with Russia and Britain to control the growing power of Germany. In this way, two opposing sides\u2014the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance of 1882]] (Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy) and the [[Triple Entente|Triple Entente of 1907]] (Britain, France and Russia)\u2014formed in Europe, improving their military forces and alliances year-by-year.\n\n==1914\u20131945: Two World wars==\n[[File:Map Europe alliances 1914-en.svg|thumb|320px|right|Military alliances leading to World War; Triple Entente in green; Central Powers in brown]]\n\nGerman-American historian [[Konrad Jarausch]], asked if he agreed that \"the European record of the past century [was] just one gigantic catastrophe\", argues:\n:It is true that the first half of the 20th century was full of internecine warfare, economic depression, ethnic cleansing and racist genocide that killed tens of millions of people, more than any other period in human history. But looking only at the disasters creates an incomplete perception, because the second half of the century witnessed a much more positive development in spite of the Cold War. After the defeat of Fascism in 1945, the peaceful revolution of 1989/90 also liberated the East from Communist control in a quite unexpected fashion. As a result, Europeans generally live more free, prosperous and healthy lives than ever before.<ref>See [http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m10427.html \"An Interview with Konrad H. Jarausch, author of Out of Ashes: A New History of Europe in the Twentieth Century\", Princeton University Press, June 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621101906/http://press.princeton.edu/releases/m10427.html |date=21 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe \"[[short twentieth century]]\", from 1914 to 1991, included the [[First World War]], the [[Second World War]] and the [[Cold War]]. The First World War used modern technology to kill millions of soldiers. Victory by Britain, France, the United States and other allies drastically changed the map of Europe, ending four major land empires (the Russian, German, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires) and leading to the creation of nation-states across Central and Eastern Europe. The [[October Revolution]] in Russia led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]] (1917\u20131991) and the rise of the international communist movement. Widespread economic prosperity was typical of the period before 1914, and 1920\u20131929. After the onset of the [[Great Depression]] in 1929, however, democracy collapsed in most of Europe. Fascists took control in Italy, and the even more aggressive Nazi movement led by Adolf Hitler took control of Germany, 1933\u201345. The Second World War was fought on an even larger scale than the First war, killing many more people, and using even more advanced technology. It ended with the division of Europe between East and West, with the East under the control of the Soviet Union and the West dominated by NATO. The two sides engaged in the [[Cold War]], with actual conflict taking place not in Europe but in Asia in the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The Imperial system collapsed. The remaining [[colonial empire]]s ended through the [[decolonisation]] of European rule in Africa and Asia. The fall of Soviet Communism (1989\u2013 1991) left the West dominant and enabled the [[reunification of Germany]]. It accelerated the process of a [[European integration]] to include Eastern Europe. The European Union continues today, but with German economic dominance. Since the worldwide Great Recession of 2008, European growth has been slow, and financial crises have hit Greece and other countries. Social divisiveness has been caused by large-scale immigration and radical Islamic rejection of European norms.  While Russia is a weak version of the old Soviet Union, it has been confronting Europe in Ukraine and other areas.\n\n===World War I===\n{{Main article|World War I|Home front during World War I|Diplomatic history of World War I|Economic history of World War I}}\n[[File:trencheswwi2.jpg|thumb|Trenches and sand bags were defences against machine guns and artillery on the Western Front, 1914\u20131918]]\n\nAfter the relative peace of most of the 19th century, the rivalry between European powers, compounded by a rising nationalism among ethnic groups, exploded in August 1914, when the [[First World War]] started.<ref>Brian Bond,  \"The First World War\" in [[C.

The Western Front involved especially brutal combat without any territorial gains by either side. Single battles like Verdun and the Somme killed hundreds of thousands of men while leaving the stalemate unchanged. Heavy artillery and machine guns caused most of the casualties, supplemented by poison gas. Czarist Russia collapsed in the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 and Germany claimed victory on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. After eight months of liberal rule, the [[October Revolution]] brought [[Vladimir Lenin]] and the Bolsheviks to power, leading to the creation of the Soviet Union in place of the disintegrated Russian Empire. With American entry into the war in 1917 on the Allied side, and the failure of Germany's spring 1918 offensive, Germany had run out of manpower, while an average of 10,000 American troops were arriving in France every day in the summer of 1918. Germany's allies, [[Austria-Hungary]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]], surrendered and dissolved, followed by Germany on 11 November 1918.<ref>Overviews include David Stevenson,  ''Cataclysm: The First World War as Political Tragedy'' (2005) and Ian F.

They met together informally 145 times and made all the major decisions, which in turn were ratified by the others.<ref>by Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1958) p 363</ref>\n\nThe major decisions were the creation of the [[League of Nations]]; the six peace treaties with defeated enemies, most notable the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany; the awarding of German and Ottoman overseas possessions as [[League of Nations mandate|\"mandates\"]], chiefly to Britain and France; and the drawing of new national boundaries (sometimes with plebiscites) to better reflect the forces of nationalism.<ref>Sally Marks, ''The Illusion of Peace: International Relations in Europe 1918\u20131933'' (2nd ed. 2003)</ref><ref>Zara Steiner, ''The Lights that Failed: European International History 1919\u20131933'' (2007)</ref>\n\nAs the conference's decisions were enacted [[unilaterally]], and largely on the whims of the Big Four, for its duration [[Paris]] was effectively the center of a [[world government]], which deliberated over and implemented the sweeping changes to the [[political geography]] of [[Europe]]. Most famously, the Treaty of Versailles itself weakened [[Reichswehr|Germany's military]] and placed [[War Guilt Clause|full blame for the war]] and [[World War I reparations|costly reparations]] on its shoulders&nbsp;\u2013 the humiliation and resentment in Germany is sometimes considered as one of the causes of Nazi success and indirectly a [[causes of World War II|cause of World War II]].\n\nAt the insistence of President Wilson, the Big Four required Poland to sign a treaty on 28 June 1919 that guaranteed [[minority rights]] in the new nation. Poland signed under protest, and made little effort to enforce the specified rights for [[Germans]], [[Jews]], [[Ukrainians]], and other minorities. Similar treaties were signed by Czechoslovakia, Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and later by Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. Finland and Germany were not asked to sign a [[Minority Treaties|minority rights treaty]].<ref>Carole Fink, \"The Paris Peace Conference and the Question of Minority Rights,\" ''Peace and Change: A journal of peace research'' (1996) 21#3 pp 273\u201388</ref>\n\n===Interwar===\n{{See also|Aftermath of World War I|Interwar period|International relations (1919\u20131939)}}\n[[File:Europe in 1923.jpg|thumb|320px|Interwar Europe in 1923]]\n[[File:Poland 567897223.jpg|thumb|320px|Polish town Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w in the Thirties.

It was a peaceful era with a few small wars before 1922 such as the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]] (1917\u20131921) and the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] (1919\u20131921). Prosperity was widespread, and the major cities sponsored a youth culture called the \"[[Roaring Twenties]]\" that was often featured in the cinema, which attracted very large audiences.\n\nThe Allied victory in the First World War seem to mark the triumph of [[History of Liberalism|liberalism]], not just in the Allied countries themselves, but also in Germany and in the new states of Eastern Europe, as well as Japan. Authoritarian militarism as typified by Germany had been defeated and discredited. Historian Martin Blinkhorn argues that the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of \"cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the League of Nations.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Nicholas Atkin|author2=Michael Biddiss|title=Themes in Modern European History, 1890\u20131945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DFN_AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA244|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|pages=243\u201344}}</ref>  However, as early as 1917, the emerging liberal order was being challenged by the new [[Communist International|communist movement]] taking inspiration from the Russian Revolution.

Historian [[Stanley G. Payne]] says Fascism in Italy was:\n:A primarily political dictatorship....The Fascist Party itself had become almost completely bureaucratized and subservient to, not dominant over, the state itself. Big business, industry, and finance retained extensive autonomy, particularly in the early years. The armed forces also enjoyed considerable autonomy....The Fascist militia was placed under military control....The judicial system was left largely intact and relatively autonomous as well. The police continued to be directed by state officials and were not taken over by party leaders...nor was a major new police elite created....There was never any question of bringing the Church under overall subservience.... Sizable sectors of Italian cultural life retained extensive autonomy, and no major state propaganda-and-culture ministry existed....The Mussolini regime was neither especially sanguinary nor particularly repressive.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

By 1940, there were only four liberal democracies left on the European continent: [[French Third Republic|France]], Finland, Switzerland and Sweden.<ref>Martin Blinkhorn, ''The Fascist Challenge'' in Gordon Martel, ed.

The worst hit sectors included heavy industry, export-oriented agriculture, mining and lumbering, and construction. World trade fell by two thirds.<ref>Charles Kindleberger, ''The World in Depression, 1929\u20131939'' (2nd ed. 1986)</ref>\n\nLiberalism and democracy were discredited. In most of Europe, as well as in Japan and most of Latin America, nation after nation turned to dictators and authoritarian regimes. The most momentous change of government came when Hitler and his Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. A major civil war took place in [[Spanish Civil War|Spain]], with the nationalists winning. The League of Nations was helpless as Italy conquered Ethiopia and Japan seized Manchuria in 1931 and took over most of China starting in 1937.<ref>David Clay Large, ''Between Two Fires: Europe's Path in the 1930s'' (1991)</ref>\n\nThe [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u20131939) was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the rebels (the Nationalists), led by [[Francisco Franco]], won in 1939. There was military intervention as Italy sent land forces, and Germany sent smaller elite air force and armoured units to the Nationalists. The Soviet Union sold armaments to the leftist Republicans on the other side, while the Communist parties in numerous countries sent soldiers to the \"[[International Brigades]].\" The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted the left, the communist movement and many liberals against Catholics, conservatives, and fascists. Britain, France and the US remained neutral and refused to sell military supplies to either side. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'' (1970) pp 262\u201376</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n{{main article|Causes of World War II|World War II|Diplomatic history of World War II|Home front during World War II}}\nIn the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938, Britain and France adopted a policy of [[appeasement]] as they gave Hitler what he wanted out of Czechoslovakia in the hope that it would bring peace. It did not. In 1939 Germany took over the rest of Czechoslovakia and appeasement policies gave way to hurried rearmament as Hitler next turned his attention to Poland.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv N 1576 Bild-003, Warschau, Bettelnde Kinder.jpg|right|thumb|Starving Jewish children in [[Warsaw Ghetto]] (1940\u20131943).]]\n[[File:Warsaw_1944.jpg|right|thumb|The fight against German Nazis during the [[Warsaw Uprising]] in 1944.]]\n[[File:AmericanAndSovietAtElbe.jpg|right|thumb|American and Soviet troops [[Elbe Day|meet in April 1945]], east of the [[Elbe River]].]]\n\nAfter allying with Japan in the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]] and then also with [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Italy]] in the \"[[Pact of Steel]]\", and finally signing a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression treaty]] with the Soviet Union in August 1939, Hitler launched the [[Second World War]] on 1 September 1939 by attacking Poland. To his surprise Britain and France declared war on Germany, but there was little fighting during the \"Phoney War\" period. War began in earnest in spring 1940 with the successful Blitzkrieg conquests of Denmark, Norway, the Low Countries, and France. Britain remained alone but refused to negotiate, and defeated Germany's air attacks in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Hitler's goal was to control Eastern Europe but because of his failure to defeat Britain and the Italian failures in North Africa and the Balkans, the great attack on the Soviet Union was delayed until June 1941. Despite initial successes, the German army was stopped close to Moscow in December 1941.<ref>I. C. B. Dear and M. R. D. Foot, eds., ''The Oxford Companion to World War II'' (1995) covers every country and major campaign.</ref>\n\nOver the next year the tide was turned and the Germans started to suffer a series of defeats, for example in the siege of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]] and at [[Battle of Kursk|Kursk]]. Meanwhile, Japan (allied to Germany and Italy since September 1940) attacked Britain and the United States on 7 December 1941; Germany then completed its over-extension by declaring war on the United States. War raged between the Axis Powers (Germany, Italy, and Japan) and the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Forces]] (British Empire, Soviet Union, and the United States). The Allied Forces won in North Africa, invaded Italy in 1943, and recaptured France in 1944. In the spring of 1945 Germany itself was invaded from the east by the Soviet Union and from the west by the other Allies. As the Red Army conquered the [[Reichstag building|Reichstag]] in Berlin, Hitler committed suicide and Germany surrendered in early May.<ref>Norman Davies, ''No Simple Victory: World War II in Europe, 1939\u20131945'' (2008)</ref> World War II was the deadliest conflict in human history, causing [[World War II casualties|between 50 and 80&nbsp;million deaths]], the majority of whom were civilians (approximately 38 to 55&nbsp;million).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://necrometrics.com/20c5m.htm |title=Second''Second Source List and Detailed Death Tolls for the Twentieth Century Hemoclysm'' |publisher=Users.erols.com |accessdate=2 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nThis period was also marked by systematic genocide. In 1942\u201345, separately from the war-related deaths, the [[Nazism|Nazis]] killed an additional number of over 11&nbsp;million civilians [[IBM and the Holocaust|identified through IBM-enabled censuses]], including the [[The Holocaust|majority of the Jews]] and [[Porajmos|Gypsies]] of Europe, millions of [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|Polish]] and [[Generalplan Ost|Soviet]] Slavs, and also homosexuals, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], misfits, disabled, and political enemies. Meanwhile, in the 1930s the Soviet system of [[Gulag|forced labour]], [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|expulsions]] and [[Holodomor|allegedly engineered famine]] had a similar death toll.

The United States and the majority of European liberal democracies at the time (United Kingdom, France, Italy, Netherlands, West Germany etc.) established the [[NATO]] military alliance. Later, the Soviet Union and its satellites (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, [[East Germany]], Hungary, Poland, and Romania)  in 1955 established the [[Warsaw Pact]] as a counterpoint to NATO. The Warsaw Pact had a much larger ground force, but the American-French-British nuclear umbrellas protected NATO.\n\n[[Communist state]]s were imposed by the Red Army in the East, while parliamentary democracy became the dominant form of government in the West. Most historians point to its success as the product of exhaustion with war and dictatorship, and the promise of continued economic prosperity. Martin Conway also adds that an important impetus came from the anti-Nazi wartime political coalitions.<ref>Martin Conway, \"The Rise and Fall of Western Europe's Democratic Age, 1945\u2013\u20131973,\" ''Contemporary European History'' (2004) 13#1 pp 67\u201388.</ref>\n===Economic recovery===\n{{Main article|Marshall Plan|European Economic Community}}\nThe United States gave away about $20 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] grants and other grants and low-interest long-term loans to Western Europe, 1945 to 1951. Historian Michael J. Hogan argues that American aid was critical in stabilizing the economy and politics of Western Europe. It brought in modern management that dramatically increased productivity, and encouraged cooperation between labor and management, and among the member states.  Local Communist parties were opposed, and they lost prestige and influence and a role in government.  In strategic terms, says Hogan, the Marshall Plan strengthened the West against The possibility of a Communist invasion or political takeover.<ref>Michael J. Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan: America, Britain and the Reconstruction of Western Europe, 1947\u20131952'' (1989)  pp. 26\u201328, 430\u2013443. </ref>  However, the Marshall Plan's role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it only miraculously revived Europe, since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already under way thanks to other aid programs from the United States.  Economic historians Bradford De Long and [[Barry Eichengreen]] conclude it was, \" History's Most Successful Structural Adjustment Program.\" They state:\n:It was not large enough to have significantly accelerated recovery by financing investment, aiding the reconstruction of damaged infrastructure, or easing commodity bottlenecks. We argue, however, that the Marshall Plan did play a major role in setting the stage for post-World War II Western Europe's rapid growth. The conditions attached to Marshall Plan aid pushed European political economy in a direction that left its post World War II \"mixed economies\" with more \"market\" and less \"controls\" in the mix.<ref>{{cite book |first=J.

It seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises. It used trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the Soviet Union.  Moscow controlled  the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin. Historian Mark Kramer concludes:\n:The net outflow of resources from eastern Europe to the Soviet Union was approximately $15 billion to $20 billion in the first decade after World War II, an amount roughly equal to the total aid provided by the United States to western Europe under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Mark Kramer, \"The Soviet Bloc and the Cold War in Europe,\" {{cite book|author=Klaus Larresm ed.|title=A Companion to Europe Since 1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EyNcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT174|year=2014|publisher=Wiley|page=79}}</ref>\n\nWestern Europe began economic and then political integration, with the aim to unite the region and defend it. This process included organisations such as the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which grew and evolved into the [[European Union]], and the [[Council of Europe]]. The [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107]] movement in the 1980s weakened the Communist government in Poland. At the time the Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] initiated [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], which weakened Soviet influence in Europe, particularly in the USSR. In 1989 the Berlin Wall came down and Communist governments outside the Soviet Union were deposed. In 1990 the Federal Republic of Germany absorbed East Germany, after making large cash payments to the USSR. In 1991 the Communist Party in Moscow collapsed, [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|ending the USSR]], which split into fifteen independent states. The largest, Russia, took the Soviet Union's seat on the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The most violent dissolution happened in [[Yugoslavia]], in the Balkans. Four ([[Slovenia]], Croatia, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]) out of six Yugoslav republics declared independence and for most of them a violent war ensued, in some parts lasting until 1995. In 2006 Montenegro seceded and became an independent state. In the post\u2013Cold War era, NATO and the EU have been gradually admitting most of the former members of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nLooking at the half century after the war historian [[Walter Laqueur|Walter Lacquer]] concluded:\n:\"The postwar generations of European elites aimed to create more democratic societies. They wanted to reduce the extremes of wealth and poverty and provide essential social services in a way that prewar generations had not. They had had quite enough of unrest and conflict. For decades many Continental societies had more or less achieved these aims and had every reason to be proud of their progress. Europe was quiet and civilized. Europe's success was based on recent painful experience: the horrors of two world wars; the lessons of dictatorship; the experiences of fascism and communism. Above all, it was based on a feeling of European identity and common values\u2014or so it appeared at the time.\"<ref>Walter Laqueur, \"The Slow Death of Europe\", ''The National Interest'' [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-the-euro-the-least-europes-worries-5767 16 August 2011 online]</ref>\n\nThe post-war period also witnessed a significant rise in the standard of living of the Western European working class. As noted by one historical text, \"within a single generation, the working classes of Western Europe came to enjoy the multiple pleasures of the consumer society.\"<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Is There Still a West?: The Future of the Atlantic Alliance|author1=Hay, W.A.|author2=Sicherman, H.|date=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press, Queen Elizabeth also had a major breakdown causing her to die cause of the stress overload.|isbn=9780826265494|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VwDQ3jAGMX0C|page=107|accessdate=18 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nWestern Europe's industrial nations in the 1970s were hit by a global economic crisis. They had obsolescent heavy industry, and suddenly had to pay very high energy prices which caused sharp inflation. Some of them also had inefficient nationalized railways and heavy industries. In the important field of computer technology, European nations lagged behind the United States. They also faced high government deficits and growing unrest led by militant labour unions. There was an urgent need for new economic directions. Germany and Sweden sought to create a social consensus behind a gradual restructuring. Germany's efforts proved highly successful. In Britain under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], the solution was shock therapy, high interest rates, austerity, and selling off inefficient corporations as well as the public housing, which was sold off to the tenants. One result was escalating social tensions in Britain, led by the militant coal miners. Thatcher eventually defeated her opponents and radically changed the British economy, but the controversy never went away as shown by the hostile demonstrations at the time of her death in 2013.<ref>David Priestland, \"Margaret Thatcher?\" \u2018\u2019BBC History Magazine\u2019\u2019 1 May 2013</ref>\n\n==Recent history==\n{{Further information|History of the European Union}}\n\n[[File:Thefalloftheberlinwall1989.JPG|thumb|right|Germans standing on top of the [[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], November 1989; it would begin to be torn apart in the following days.]]\n[[File:Cold War border changes.png|thumb|upright=1.182|Changes in national boundaries after the end of the Cold War]]\n\nFollowing the end of the Cold War, the [[European Economic Community]] pushed for closer integration, co-operation in foreign and home affairs, and started to increase its membership into the neutral and former communist countries.

The neutral countries of Austria, Finland and Sweden acceded to the EU, and those that didn't join were tied into the EU's economic market via the [[European Economic Area]]. These countries also entered the [[Schengen Agreement]] which lifted border controls between member states.<ref name=\"Europa History 90-99\">{{cite web |title=A Europe without frontiers |publisher=[[Europa (web portal)]] |url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/1990-1999/index_en.htm |accessdate=25 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Maastricht Treaty created a single currency for most EU members. The ''[[euro]]'' was created in 1999 and replaced all previous currencies in participating states in 2002. The most notable exception to the currency union, or ''[[eurozone]]'', was the United Kingdom, which also did not sign the Schengen Agreement.\n\nEU did not participate in the [[Yugoslav Wars]], and was divided on supporting the United States in the 2003\u20132011 [[Iraq War]]. NATO has been part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war in Afghanistan]], but at a much lower level of involvement than the United States.\n\nIn 2004, the EU [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|gained 10 new members]]. ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]], which had been part of the Soviet Union; [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia]], five former-communist countries; [[Malta]], and the divided island of [[Cyprus]].) These were followed by [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|Bulgaria and Romania in 2007]]. Russia's regime had interpreted these expansions as violations against NATO's promise to not expand \"one inch to the east\" in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nato-s-eastward-expansion-did-the-west-break-its-promise-to-moscow-a-663315-2.html|title=NATO's Eastward Expansion: Calming Russian Fears \u2013 SPIEGEL ONLINE|author=SPIEGEL ONLINE, Hamburg, Germany|date=26 November 2009|work=SPIEGEL ONLINE}}</ref> Russia engaged in a number of bilateral disputes about gas supplies with [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] which endangered gas supplies to Europe. Russia also engaged in a [[Russo-Georgian War|minor war with Georgia]] in 2008.\n\nSupported by the United States and some European countries, [[Kosovo]]'s government [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from Serbia on 17 February 2008.\n\nPublic opinion in the EU turned against enlargement, partially due to what was seen as over-eager expansion including Turkey gaining candidate status. The [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] was rejected [[Referendums related to the European Union|in France and the Netherlands]], and then (as the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) in Ireland, although a second vote passed in Ireland in 2009.\n\nThe [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] [[Great Recession|effected]] Europe, and government responded with [[Anti-austerity movement|austerity measures]]. Limited [[National accounts|ability]] of the smaller EU nations (most notably [[Economy of Greece#2010\u2013present government debt crisis|Greece]]) to handle their debts led to social unrest, government liquidation, and financial insolvency. In May 2010, the German parliament agreed to loan 22.4&nbsp;billion euros to Greece over three years, with the stipulation that Greece follow strict austerity measures. See [[European sovereign-debt crisis]].\n\nBeginning in 2014, [[Ukraine]] has been in a [[2014 Ukrainian revolution|state of revolution]] and unrest with two breakaway regions ([[Donetsk]] and [[Lugansk]]) attempting to join [[Russia]] as full [[Federal subjects of Russia|federal subjects]]. (''See [[War in Donbass]].'') On 16 March, a [[Crimean status referendum, 2014|referendum]] was held in [[Crimea]] leading to the ''[[de facto]]'' secession of Crimea and its largely internationally unrecognized [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation]] to the Russian Federation as the [[Republic of Crimea]].\n\nThe future of the EU was plunged into doubt in June 2016 when a [[United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|United Kingdom membership referendum]] resulted in the country's [[Brexit|intended withdrawal]]. 52% of the British voters voted to leave the EU, leading into a complex separation process implying [[Aftermath of the United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, 2016|political and economic changes]] for both the UK and the remaining European Union countries.\n\n==Chronology==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* 700&nbsp;BC: [[Homer]] composes ''[[Iliad|The Iliad]]'', an epic poem that represents the first piece of European literature.\n* 440&nbsp;BC: [[Herodotus]] defends Athenian [[political freedom]] in the ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]''.\n* 323&nbsp;BC: [[Alexander the Great]] dies and his [[Macedonian Empire]] fragments.\n* 44&nbsp;BC: [[Julius Caesar]] is murdered.

Quine believed that all beliefs are linked by a [[web of beliefs]], in which a belief is linked to another belief by supporting relations, but if one belief is found untrue, there is ground to find the linked beliefs also untrue.<ref name=\"Ney\"/>\n\nA closely related concept is '''hold more stubbornly at least''', also popularized by Quine. Some beliefs may be more useful than others, or may be implied by a large number of beliefs.  Examples might be laws of [[logic]], or the belief in an external world of physical objects.  Altering such central portions of the web of beliefs would have immense, ramifying consequences, and affect many other beliefs.  It is better to alter auxiliary beliefs around the edges of the web of beliefs (considered to be sense beliefs, rather than main beliefs) in the face of new evidence unfriendly to one's central principles.<ref>{{cite book |first=Willard Van Orman |last=Quine |chapter=Two Dogmas of Empiricism |title=From a Logical Point of View |edition=2nd revised |location=Cambridge |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1980 |isbn=0674323513 }}</ref>  Thus, while one might agree that there is no belief one can hold come what may, there are some for which there is ample practical ground to \"hold more stubbornly at least\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hold Come What May}}\n[[Category:English phrases]]\n[[Category:Belief]]\n[[Category:Concepts in logic]]\n[[Category:Willard Van Orman Quine]]", "sha1": "by7uugtr73fr5bb6qvus5mzt0kbb7x0"}}, {"title": "Haiku", "ns": "0", "id": "13217", "revision": {"id": "862699780", "parentid": "861219709", "timestamp": "2018-10-06T03:34:52Z", "contributor": {"username": "Wiki13565", "id": "22651524"}, "minor": "", "comment": "/* The beginnings of Romance-language haiku */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{about|the Japanese poetic form|haiku poetry written in English|Haiku in English|other uses}}\n{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}\n{{Nihongo|'''''Haiku'''''|[[wikt:\u4ff3\u53e5|\u4ff3\u53e5]]}} {{Audio|ja-haiku.ogg|listen}} (plural ''haiku'') is a very short [[Japanese poetry|Japanese poem]] with seventeen syllables and three verses.<ref name=V\u00e1squez-Rocca>{{cite journal |title=L\u00f3gica paraconsistente, mundos posibles y ficciones narrativas |url=http://serbal.pntic.mec.es/~cmunoz11/vasquez38.pdf |format=PDF |last=V\u00e1squez Rocca |first=Adolfo |date=January 2005 |access-date=28 June 2018 |magazine=A Parte Rei |issue=37 |language=es |page=8}}</ref> It is typically characterized by three qualities:\n\n# The essence of haiku is \"cutting\" (''kiru'').<ref name=Yamada-Bochynek>{{cite book|last=Yamada-Bochynek|first=Yoriko|title=Haiku East and West|year=1985|publisher=Universitatsverlag Brockmeyer|location=Bochum|isbn=978-3883394046|page=255}}</ref>  This is often represented by the juxtaposition of two images or ideas and a ''[[kireji]]'' (\"cutting word\") between them,<ref name=\"Hiraga 1999 27\">{{cite book|last=Hiraga|first=Masako K.|title=\"Rough Sea and the Milky Way: 'Blending' in a Haiku Text,\" in Computation for Metaphors, Analogy, and Agents, ed.

''One Hundred Frogs: from renga to haiku to English'', Weatherhill 1983, {{ISBN|0-8348-0176-0}}</ref>\n\nIn English, since ''kireji'' have no direct equivalent, poets sometimes use punctuation such as a dash or ellipsis, or an implied break to create a juxtaposition intended to prompt the reader to reflect on the relationship between the two parts.\n\nThe ''kireji'' in the [[#Examples|Bash\u014d examples]] \"old pond\" and \"the wind of Mt Fuji\" are both \"ya\" ({{nihongo2|\u3084}}). Neither the remaining Bash\u014d example nor the Issa example contain a ''kireji'' although they do both balance a fragment in the first five ''on'' against a phrase in the remaining 12 ''on'' (it may not be apparent from the English translation of the Issa that the first five ''on'' mean \"Edo's rain\").\n\n==Syllables or ''on'' in haiku==\n{{Main|On (Japanese prosody)}}\nIn comparison with English verse typically characterized by syllabic [[Meter (poetry)#English|meter]], Japanese verse counts sound units known as \"''[[On (Japanese prosody)|on]]''\" or [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]e. Traditional haiku consist of 17 ''on'', in three phrases of five, seven and five ''on'' respectively. Among contemporary poems ''teikei'' ({{nihongo2|\u5b9a\u578b}} fixed form) haiku continue to use the 5-7-5 pattern while ''jiyuritsu'' ({{nihongo2|\u81ea\u7531\u5f8b}} free form) haiku do not.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} One of the [[#Examples|examples below]] illustrates that traditional haiku masters were not always constrained by the 5-7-5 pattern.\n\nAlthough the word \"''on''\" is sometimes translated as \"syllable\", one ''on'' is counted for a short syllable, two for an [[Vowel length|elongated vowel]] or [[Gemination|doubled consonant]], and one for an \"n\" at the end of a syllable. Thus, the word \"haibun\", though counted as two syllables in English, is counted as four ''on'' in Japanese (ha-i-bu-n); and the word \"''on''\" itself, which English-speakers would view as a single syllable, comprises two ''on'': the short vowel '''o''' and the [[b:Japanese/Pronunciation#Moraic nasal|moraic nasal]] '''[[Japanese phonology#Moraic nasal|{{IPA|n\u0329}}]]'''. This is illustrated by the [[#Examples|Issa haiku]] below, which contains 17 ''on'' but only 15 syllables. Conversely, some [[Y\u014don|sounds]], such as \"kyo\" ({{nihongo2|\u304d\u3087}}) may look like two syllables to English speakers but are in fact a single ''on'' (as well as a single syllable) in Japanese.\n\nIn 1973, the [[Haiku Society of America]] noted that the norm for writers of [[haiku in English]] was to use 17 syllables, but they also noted a trend toward shorter haiku.<ref>[http://www.hsa-haiku.org/archives/HSA_Definitions_2004.html#Old_Haiku 1973 definition of haiku] on the website of the [[Haiku Society of America]]</ref> Shorter haiku are very much more common in 21st century English haiku writing.\n\nSome translators of Japanese poetry have noted that about 12 syllables in English approximate the duration of 17 Japanese ''on''.<ref>[http://www.hsa-haiku.org/archives/HSA_Definitions_2004.html#Haiku definition of haiku] on the website of the [[Haiku Society of America]]</ref> Also in translations four lines is more appropriate for the colloquialism of the language and is closest to natural conversational rhythm, necessary to carry the weight of the [[hokku]]<ref>Yuasa, Nobuyuki, Introduction 'The Narrow Road and Other travel sketches' by Matsuo Basho, Penguin Classics, London 1966 {{OCLC|563174463}}</ref>\n\n==Kigo==\n{{Main|Kigo}}\nA haiku traditionally contains a ''[[kigo]]'', a word or phrase that symbolizes or implies the season of the poem and which is drawn from a ''[[saijiki]]'', an extensive but prescriptive list of such words.\n\nKigo are often in the form of [[Metonymy|metonyms]]{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and can be difficult for those who lack Japanese cultural references to spot.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The [[#Examples|Bash\u014d examples below]] include \"kawazu\", \"frog\" implying spring, and \"shigure\", a rain shower in late autumn or early winter.

By the time of [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644\u20131694), the hokku had begun to appear as an independent poem, and was also incorporated in [[haibun]] (a combination of prose and hokku), and [[haiga]] (a combination of painting with hokku). In the late 19th century, [[Masaoka Shiki]] (1867\u20131902) renamed the standalone hokku to haiku.<ref>Higginson, William J. ''The Haiku Handbook'', Kodansha International, 1985, {{ISBN|4-7700-1430-9}}, p.20</ref> The latter term is now generally applied retrospectively to all hokku appearing independently of renku or renga, irrespective of when they were written, and the use of the term hokku to describe a stand-alone poem is considered obsolete.<ref>van den Heuvel, 1986, p.357</ref>\n\n===Bash\u014d===\n{{Main|Matsuo Bash\u014d|Hokku}}\nIn the 17th century, two masters arose who elevated ''[[haikai]]'' and gave it a new popularity. They were [[Matsuo Bash\u014d]] (1644\u20131694) and {{Interlanguage link multi|Ueshima Onitsura|ja|3=\u4e0a\u5cf6\u9b3c\u8cab}} (1661\u20131738). ''[[Hokku]]'' is the first verse of the collaborative ''haikai'' or ''[[renku]]'', but its position as the opening verse made it the most important, setting the tone for the whole composition. Even though ''hokku'' had sometimes appeared individually, they were always understood in the context of ''renku''.<ref name=sato /> The Bash\u014d school promoted standalone ''hokku'' by including many in their anthologies, thus giving birth to what is now called \"haiku\".  Bash\u014d also used his ''hokku'' as torque points {{what|date=May 2017}} within his short prose sketches and longer travel diaries. This subgenre of ''haikai'' is known as ''[[haibun]]''. His best-known work, ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]'', or ''Narrow Roads to the Interior'', is counted as one of the classics of Japanese literature<ref>Yuasa, Nobuyuki. ''The Narrow Road to the Deep North and other travel sketches'', Penguin 1966, {{ISBN|0-14-044185-9}} p.39</ref> and has been translated into English extensively.\n\nBash\u014d was deified by both the imperial government and [[Shinto]] religious headquarters one hundred years after his death because he raised the haikai genre from a playful game of wit to sublime poetry. He continues to be revered as a saint of poetry in Japan, and is the one name from classical Japanese literature that is familiar throughout the world.<ref>Rimer, J. Thomas. ''A Reader's Guide to Japanese Literature'', Kodansha International 1988, {{ISBN|4-7700-1396-5}} pp.69-70</ref>\n\n===Buson===\n{{Main|Yosa Buson}}\n[[Image:YosaBusonGrave.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave of [[Yosa Buson]]]]\nThe next famous style of haikai to arise was that of [[Yosa Buson]] (1716\u20131783) and others such as Kit\u014d, called the Tenmei style after the [[Tenmei|Tenmei Era]] (1781\u20131789) in which it was created.\n\nBuson is recognized as one of the greatest masters of [[haiga]] (an art form where painting is combined with haiku or haikai prose). His affection for painting can be seen in the painterly style of his haiku.<ref>Ross, Bruce. ''Haiku Moment: An Anthology of Contemporary North American Haiku,'' Tuttle Publishing, 1993, {{ISBN|0-8048-1820-7}}  p.xv</ref>\n\n===Issa===\n{{Main|Kobayashi Issa}}\nNo new popular style followed Buson. However, a very individualistic, and at the same time humanistic, approach to writing haiku was demonstrated by the poet [[Kobayashi Issa]] (1763\u20131827), whose miserable childhood, poverty, sad life, and devotion to the [[Pure Land]] sect of [[Buddhism]] are evident in his poetry. Issa made the genre immediately accessible to wider audiences.\n\n===Shiki===\n{{Main|Masaoka Shiki}}\n[[Masaoka Shiki]] (1867\u20131902) was a reformer and modernizer. A prolific writer, even though chronically ill during a significant part of his life, Shiki disliked the 'stereotype' of haikai writers of the 19th century who were known by the deprecatory term ''tsukinami'', meaning 'monthly', after the monthly or twice-monthly ''haikai'' gatherings of the end of the 18th century (in regard to this period of ''haikai'', it came to mean 'trite' and 'hackneyed'). Shiki also criticized Bash\u014d.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} Like the Japanese [[intellectual]] world in general at that time, Shiki was strongly influenced by Western culture. He favored the painterly style of Buson and particularly the European concept of ''[[En plein air|plein-air]]'' [[painting]], which he adapted to create a style of haiku as a kind of nature sketch in words, an approach called ''shasei'' ({{nihongo2|\u5199\u751f}}, \"sketching from life\"). He popularized his views by verse columns and [[essay]]s in [[newspaper]]s.\n\nHokku up to the time of Shiki, even when appearing independently, were written in the context of renku.<ref name=sato>Hiroaki Sato. ''One Hundred Frogs'', Weatherhill, 1983, {{ISBN|0-8348-0176-0}} p.113</ref> Shiki formally separated his new style of verse from the context of collaborative poetry. Being [[Agnosticism|agnostic]],<ref>Henderson, Harold G. ''An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Basho to Shiki,'' Doubleday Anchor Books, 1958, p.163</ref> he also separated it from the influence of Buddhism. Further, he discarded the term \"hokku\" and proposed the term ''haiku'' as an abbreviation of the phrase \"''haikai no ku''\" meaning a verse of ''[[haikai]]'',<ref>Earl Miner, ''Japanese Linked Poetry''. Princeton University Press, 1980. {{ISBN|0-691-01368-3}} pbk.</ref> although the term predates Shiki by some two centuries, when it was used to mean ''any'' verse of haikai.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Since then, \"haiku\" has been the term usually applied in both Japanese and English to all independent haiku, irrespective of their date of composition. Shiki's revisionism dealt a severe blow to renku and surviving haikai schools. The term \"hokku\" is now used chiefly in its original sense of the opening verse of a renku, and rarely to distinguish haiku written before Shiki's time.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Haibun===\n{{Main|Haibun}}\n[[Haibun]] is a combination of prose and haiku, often autobiographical or written in the form of a [[travel journal]].\n\n===Haiga===\n{{Main|Haiga}}\n[[Haiga]] is a style of Japanese painting based on the aesthetics of [[haikai]], and usually including a haiku.

One of the first advocates of English-language hokku was the Japanese poet [[Yone Noguchi]]. In \"A Proposal to American Poets,\" published in the ''Reader'' magazine in February 1904, Noguchi gave a brief outline of the hokku and some of his own English efforts, ending with the exhortation, \"Pray, you try Japanese Hokku, my American poets!\"  At about the same time the poet [[Sadakichi Hartmann]] was publishing original English-language hokku, as well as other Japanese forms in both English and French.\n\nIn France, haiku was introduced by [[Paul-Louis Couchoud]] around 1906. Couchoud's articles were read by early [[Imagist]] theoretician [[F. S. Flint]], who passed on Couchoud's ideas to other members of the proto-Imagist [[Poets' Club]] such as [[Ezra Pound]]. [[Amy Lowell]] made a trip to London to meet Pound and find out about haiku. She returned to the United States where she worked to interest others in this \"new\" form. Haiku subsequently had a considerable influence on Imagists in the 1910s, notably Pound's \"[[In a Station of the Metro]]\" of 1913, but, notwithstanding several efforts by [[Yone Noguchi]] to explain \"the hokku spirit\", there was as yet little understanding of the form and its history.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Blyth===\n{{Main|Reginald Horace Blyth}}\n[[Reginald Horace Blyth|R. H. Blyth]] was an [[Englishman]] who lived in Japan. He produced a series of works on [[Zen]], haiku, [[senry\u016b]], and on other forms of [[Japanese literature|Japanese]] and Asian literature. In 1949, with the publication in Japan of the first volume of ''Haiku'', the four-volume work by Blyth, haiku were introduced to the post-war English-speaking world. This four-volume series (1949\u201352) described haiku from the pre-modern period up to and including [[Masaoka Shiki|Shiki]]. Blyth's ''History of Haiku'' (1964) in two volumes is regarded as a classical study of haiku. Today Blyth is best known as a major interpreter of haiku to English speakers. His works have stimulated the writing of haiku in English.\n\n===Yasuda===\n{{Main|Kenneth Yasuda}}\nThe Japanese-American scholar and translator [[Kenneth Yasuda]] published ''The Japanese Haiku: Its Essential Nature, History, and Possibilities in English, with Selected Examples'' in 1957. The book includes both translations from Japanese and original poems of his own in English, which had previously appeared in his book titled ''A Pepper-Pod: Classic Japanese Poems together with Original Haiku''. In these books Yasuda presented a critical theory about haiku, to which he added comments on haiku poetry by early 20th-century poets and critics. His translations apply a 5\u20137\u20135 syllable count in English, with the first and third lines end-rhymed. Yasuda considered that haiku translated into English should utilize all of the poetic resources of the language.<ref>Yasuda, Kenneth, Introduction 'The Japanese Haiku' Charles Tuttle Co Rutland 1957 {{ISBN|0804810966}}</ref> Yasuda's theory also includes the concept of a \"haiku moment\"  based in personal experience, and provides the motive for writing a haiku (' an aesthestic moment' of a timeless feeling of enlightened harmony as the poet's nature and the environment are unified'<ref>Otsuiji(Seiki Osuga) Otsuji Hairon-shu 'Otsuiji's Collected Essays on Haiku Theory' ed.Toyo Yoshida, 5th edn Tokyo, Kaede Shobo 1947</ref>). This notion of the haiku moment has resonated with haiku writers in English, even though the notion is not widely promoted in Japanese haiku.(See however, 'Shiki's Haiku Moments for Us Today'<ref>Hirai, Masako ed.Now to be!

Henderson}}\nIn 1958, ''An Introduction to Haiku: An Anthology of Poems and Poets from Bash\u00f4 to Shiki'' by [[Harold G. Henderson]] was published by Doubleday Anchor Books. This book was a revision of Henderson's earlier book titled ''The Bamboo Broom'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1934). After World War II, Henderson and Blyth worked for the [[Occupation of Japan|American Occupation in Japan]] and for the [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial Household]], respectively, and their shared appreciation of haiku helped form a bond between the two.\n\nHenderson translated every hokku and haiku into a [[rhyme]]d [[tercet]] (a-b-a), whereas the Japanese originals never used rhyme. Unlike Yasuda, however, he recognized that 17 syllables in English are generally longer than the 17 ''on'' of a traditional Japanese haiku. Because the normal modes of English poetry depend on accentual meter rather than on syllabics, Henderson chose to emphasize the order of events and images in the originals.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Nevertheless, many of Henderson's translations were in the five-seven-five pattern.\n\n===English-language haiku===\n{{Main|Haiku in English}}\nThe first haiku written in English was arguably by [[Ezra Pound]], ''[[In a Station of the Metro]]'', published in 1913.<ref>''Haiku in English: The First Hundred Years'', eds. Jim Kacian, Philip Rowland, and Allan Burns, W.W. Norton & Co, New York, 2013</ref> Since then, the haiku has become a fairly popular form among English-speaking poets. English haiku can follow the traditional Japanese rules, but are frequently less strict, particularly concerning the number of syllables and subject matter.\n\nThe loosening of traditional standards has resulted in the term \"haiku\" being applied to brief English-language poems such as \"mathemaku\" and other kinds of pseudohaiku. Some sources claim that this is justified by the blurring of definitional boundaries in Japan.<ref>Grumman, Bob.

Hawks' family on his father's side were American pioneers and his ancestor John Hawks had emigrated from [[England]] to [[Massachusetts]] in 1630. The family eventually settled in Goshen and by the 1890s was one of the wealthiest families in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], due mostly to the highly profitable Goshen Milling Company.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=18-19}}\n\nHawks' maternal grandfather, C. W. Howard (1845\u20131916), had homesteaded in [[Neenah, Wisconsin]] in 1862 at age 17. Within 15 years he had made his fortune in the town's [[paper mill]] and other industrial endeavors.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=25}} Frank Hawks and Helen Howard met in the early  1890s and married in 1895. Howard Hawks was the eldest of five children and his birth was followed by [[Kenneth Hawks|Kenneth Neil Hawks]] (August 12, 1899 \u2013 January 2, 1930), [[William Hawks|William Bellinger Hawks]] (January 29, 1901 \u2013 January 10, 1969), Grace Louise Hawks (October 17, 1903 \u2013 December 23, 1927) and Helen Bernice Hawks (1906 \u2013 May 4, 1911). In 1898, the family moved to [[Neenah, Wisconsin]] where Frank Hawks began working for his father-in-law's Howard Paper Company.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=27-29}}\n\n====Education====\nBetween 1906 and 1909, the Hawks family began to spend more time in [[Pasadena, California]] during the cold Wisconsin winters in order to improve Helen Hawks' ill health. Gradually they began to spend only their summers in Wisconsin before permanently moving to Pasadena in 1910.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=31}} The family settled in a house down the street from [[California Institute of Technology|Throop Polytechnic Institute]] (which would eventually become California Institute of Technology), and the Hawks children began attending the school's [[Polytechnic School|Polytechnic Elementary School]] in 1907.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=34-35}} Hawks was an average student at school and did not excel in sports, but by 1910 had discovered [[Gravity racer|coaster racing]], an early form of soapbox racing.

But in 1912, the Hawks family moved to nearby [[Glendora, California]], where Frank Hawks owned orange groves.

He returned to Cornell that September, leaving in April 1917 to join the [[United States Army|Army]] when the [[United States]] entered [[World War I]]. During World War I, he taught aviators to fly and he used these experiences as influences to future aviation films such as ''The Dawn Patrol'' (1930).{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=5}} Like many college students who joined the armed services during the war, he received a degree in absentia in 1918. Before Hawks was called for active duty, he returned to [[Hollywood]] and by the end of April 1917 was working on a [[Cecil B. DeMille]] film.\n\n===1918&ndash;1925: Entering films===\nHoward Hawks's interest and passion for aviation led him to many important experiences and acquaintances.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=5}} In 1916, Hawks met [[Victor Fleming]], a Hollywood cinematographer who had been an auto mechanic and early aviator. Fleming had become involved in the film industry when a friend, [[Marshall Neilan]], recommended Fleming to film director [[Allan Dwan]] as a good mechanic. (Fleming impressed Dwan by quickly fixing both his car and a faulty film camera.) By 1916, Fleming had become a [[cinematographer]]. Hawks met Fleming when he began racing and working on a [[Mercer (automobile)|Mercer]] [[race car]]\u2014bought for him by his grandfather, C.W. Howard\u2014during his 1916 summer vacation in California. He allegedly met Fleming when the two men raced on a dirt track and caused an accident.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=39-42}} The meeting with [[Victor Fleming|Fleming]] led to Hawks' first job in the [[film industry]], as a [[Theatrical property|prop boy]] on the [[Douglas Fairbanks]] film ''[[In Again, Out Again]]'' (on which Fleming was employed as the cinematographer) for [[Famous Players-Lasky]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=42-44}} According to Hawks, a new set needed to be built quickly when the studio's [[set designer]] was unavailable, so Hawks volunteered to do the job himself, much to Fairbanks' satisfaction. He was next employed as a prop boy and general assistant on an unspecified film directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. (Hawks never named the film in later interviews and DeMille made five films roughly in that time period).\n\nBy the end of April 1917, Hawks was working on Cecil B. DeMille's ''[[The Little American]]''. (On this film he met and befriended the then 18-year-old [[Clapperboard|slate boy]] [[James Wong Howe]], who was to become one of Hollywood's most significant [[cinematographer]]s.){{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=42-44}} Hawks then worked on the [[Mary Pickford]] film ''[[The Little Princess (1917 film)|The Little Princess]]'', directed by [[Marshall Neilan]]. According to Hawks, Neilan did not show up to work one day, so the resourceful Hawks offered to direct a scene himself, to which Pickford consented.<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|1997|p=44}}; {{harvnb|Breivold|2006|p=74}}</ref>\n\nHawks began directing at age 21 after he and cinematographer [[Charles Rosher]] filmed a [[double exposure]] dream sequence with Mary Pickford. Hawks worked with Pickford and Neilan again on ''[[Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley]]'' before joining the [[United States Army Air Service]]. Hawks' military records were destroyed in the [[National Personnel Records Center fire|1973 Military Archive Fire]], so the only account of his military service is his own. According to Hawks, he spent 15 weeks in basic training at the [[University of California in Berkeley]] where he was trained to be a [[Commander (United States)#U.S. Air Force|squadron commander]] in the air force. When Pickford visited Hawks at basic training, his superior officers were so impressed by the appearance of the celebrity that they promoted him to [[flight instructor]] and sent him to [[Texas]] to teach new recruits. Bored by this work, Hawks attempted to secure a transfer during the first half of 1918 and was eventually sent to [[Fort Monroe, Virginia]]. The [[Armistice with Germany|Armistice]] was signed in November of that year, and Hawks was discharged as a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|Second Lieutenant]] without having seen active duty.<ref>{{harvnb|McCarthy|1997|pp=45\u201347}}; {{harvnb|Wakeman|1987|pp=446\u2013451}}</ref>\n\nAfter the war, Hawks was eager to return to Hollywood. His brother, Kenneth Hawks, who had also served in the Air Force, graduated from [[Yale University]] in 1919, and the two of them moved to Hollywood together to pursue their careers. They quickly made friends with Hollywood insider (and fellow Ivy Leaguer) [[Allan Dwan]]. Hawks landed his first important job when he used his family's wealth to loan money to studio head [[Jack L. Warner]]. Warner quickly paid back the loan and hired Hawks as a producer to \"oversee\" the making of a new [[Serial film|series]] of [[short films|one-reel]] comedies starring the Italian comedian [[Monty Banks]]. Hawks later stated that he personally directed \"three or four\" of the shorts, though no documentation exists to confirm the claim. The films were profitable, but Hawks soon left to form his own production company using his family's wealth and connections to secure financing. The production company, ''Associated Producers,'' was a joint venture between Hawks, Allan Dwan, [[Marshall Neilan]], and director [[Allen Holubar]], with a distribution deal with [[First National Pictures|First National]]. The company made 14 films between 1920 and 1923, with 8 directed by Neilan, 3 by Dwan and 3 by Holubar.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=49-52}} More of a \"boy's club\" than a production company, the four men gradually drifted apart and went their separate ways in 1923, by which time Hawks had decided that he wanted to direct rather than produce.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=56}}\n\nBeginning in early 1920, Hawks lived in rented houses in Hollywood with the group of friends he was accumulating. This rowdy group of mostly macho, risk-taking men included his brother Kenneth Hawks, [[Victor Fleming]], [[Jack Conway (filmmaker)|Jack Conway]], [[Harold Rosson]], [[Richard Rosson (filmmaker)|Richard Rosson]], [[Arthur Rosson]] and [[Eddie Sutherland]]. During this time, Hawks first met [[Irving Thalberg]], the frail and sickly vice-President in charge of production at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. Eventually many of the young men in this group would become successful at MGM under Thalberg. Hawks admired his intelligence and sense of story.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=57-58}} Hawks also became friends with barn stormers and pioneer [[aviators]] at Rogers Airport in Los Angeles, getting to know men like [[Moye Stephens]].\n\nIn 1923, [[Famous Players-Lasky]] president [[Jesse Lasky]] was looking for a new Production Editor in the story department of his studio and Thalberg suggested Hawks.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}} Hawks accepted and was immediately put in charge of over 40 productions, including several literary acquisitions of stories by [[Joseph Conrad]], [[Jack London]] and [[Zane Grey]]. Hawks worked on the scripts for all of the films produced, but he had his first official screenplay credit in 1924 on ''Tiger Love''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=59-60}} Hawks was the Story Editor at Famous Players (later [[Paramount Pictures]]) for almost two years, occasionally editing such films as ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1924 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]''. Hawks signed a new one-year contract with Famous-Players in the fall of 1924. He broke his contract to become a story editor for Thalberg at MGM, having secured a promise from Thalberg to make him a director within a year. In 1925, when Thalberg hesitated to keep his promise, Hawks broke his contract at MGM and left.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=60-63}}\n\n===1925&ndash;1970: Career as a filmmaker===\n\n====Silent films: 1925\u20131929====\nIn October 1925, [[Sol Wurtzel]], [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]]'s studio superintendent at the [[20th Century Fox|Fox Film Corporation]], invited Hawks to join his company with the promise of letting Hawks direct. Over the next three years, Hawks directed his first eight films (six silent, two \"[[sound films|talkies]]\").{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}} (A few months after joining Fox, Kenneth Hawks was also hired and eventually became one of Fox's top production supervisors.){{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=64-65}} Hawks reworked the scripts of most of the films he directed without always taking official credit for his work. He also worked on the scripts for ''Honesty \u2013 The Best Policy'' in 1926{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=71-74}} and [[Joseph von Sternberg]]'s ''[[Underworld (1927 film)|Underworld]]'' in 1927, famous for being one of the first [[gangster film]]s.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=76}}\n\nAlso at this time in 1926, Hawks was introduced to [[Athole Shearer]] by his friend [[Victor Fleming]], who was dating Athole's sister [[Norma Shearer]]. Athole's first marriage to writer John Ward had been unhappy. She and Hawks began dating throughout 1927, which led Shearer to ask Ward for a divorce in 1928. Shearer had a young son with Ward named Peter.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=78-81}} Hawks and Athole Shearer married on May 28, 1928, and they honeymooned in [[Hawaii]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=95-96}} Hawks and Shearer had their first child, David Hawks.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=105}} At the same time, Kenneth Hawks began dating actress [[Mary Astor]], while Hawks' youngest brother Bill began dating actress [[Bessie Love]]. Kenneth Hawks and Mary Astor eventually married in February 1928,{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=81-83}} while Bill Hawks and Bessie Love married in December 1929.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=106}} Hawks' sister Grace died of [[tuberculosis]] on December 23, 1927, after Hawks' mother refused to allow medical treatment because of her [[Christian Science]] beliefs,{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=82}}\n\n'''''The Road to Glory'' (1926)'''\n\nHawks' first film ''The Road to Glory'' was based on a 35-page treatment that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are [[lost film]]s. The film starred [[May McAvoy]] as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend [[Rockliffe Fellowes]] and her father [[Ford Sterling]], with [[Leslie Fenton]] playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, \"It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics.\" Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when [[Sol Wurtzel]] told Hawks, \"Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=65-68}}\n\n'''''Fig Leaves'' (1926)'''\n[[File:Fig-leaves-1926.jpg|thumb|Poster for the comedy ''Fig Leaves'' (1926), one of the few early films Hawks valued positively later in his life.]]\nImmediately after completing ''The Road to Glory'', Hawks began writing his next film, ''[[Fig Leaves]]'', his first (and, until 1935, only) comedy. The film portrays a married couple by juxtaposing them in the [[Garden of Eden]] and in modern [[New York City]]. The Garden of Eden humorously depicts Adam and Eve awoken by a [[Flintstones]]-like coconut alarm clock and Adam reading the morning news on giant stone tablets. In the modern day, the biblical serpent is replaced by Eve's gossiping neighbor and Eve becomes a sexy [[flapper]] and fashion model when Adam is at work. The film starred [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as Adam and [[Olive Borden]] as Eve and received positive reviews, particularly for the art direction and costume designs. It was released in July 1926 and was Hawks' first hit as a director. Although he mainly dismissed his early work, Hawks praised this film in later interviews.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=69-71}}\n\n'''''Paid to Love'' (1927)'''\n\n''[[Paid to Love]]'' is notable in Hawks' filmography as being the only time that he made a highly stylized, experimental film. He attempted to imitate the style of German film director [[F. W. Murnau]], who had recently made ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|The Last Laugh]]'' and ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'' and was the most critically acclaimed director in Hollywood. Hawks' film includes atypical tracking shots, expressionistic lighting and stylistic film editing that was inspired by [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] cinema. In a later interview, Hawks commented \"It isn't my type of stuff, at least I got it over in a hurry. You know the idea of wanting the camera to do those things: Now the camera's somebody's eyes.\" Hawks worked on the script with [[Seton I. Miller]], with whom he would go on to collaborate on seven more films. The film stars [[George O'Brien (actor)|George O'Brien]] as the introverted Crown Prince Michael, [[William Powell]] as his happy-go-lucky brother and [[Virginia Valli]] as Michael's flapper love interest Dolores. The characters played by Valli and O'Brien anticipate those found in later films by Hawks: a sexually aggressive showgirl, who is an early prototype of the \"[[Hawksian woman]]\", and a shy man disinterested in sex, found in later roles played by [[Cary Grant]] and [[Gary Cooper]]. ''Paid to Love'' was completed by September 1926, but remained unreleased until July 1927, when it was financially unsuccessful.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=72-75}}\n\n'''''Cradle Snatchers'' (1927)'''\n\n''[[Cradle Snatchers]]'' was based on a 1925 hit stage play by Russell G. Medcraft and Norma Mitchell about three unhappy, middle-aged housewives who teach their adulterous husbands a lesson by starting affairs with college-aged young men during the [[jazz age]]. The film starred [[Louise Fazenda]], [[Dorothy Phillips]] and [[Ethel Wales]] and was shot in early 1927. The film was released in May 1927 and was a minor hit. For many years it was believed to be a [[lost film]] until film director [[Peter Bogdanovich]] discovered a print in 20th Century Fox's film vaults, although the print was missing part of reel three and all of reel four.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=76-78}}\n\n'''''Fazil'' (1928)'''\n\nIn March 1927, Hawks signed a new one-year, three-picture contract with Fox and was assigned to direct ''Fazil'', based on the play ''L'Insoumise'' by [[Pierre Frondaie]]. Hawks again worked with Seton Miller on the script about a Middle Eastern prince who has an affair with a Parisienne showgirl and cast [[Charles Farrell]] as the prince and [[Greta Nissen]] as Fabienne. Hawks went both over schedule and over budget on the film, which began a rift between him and Sol Wurtzel that would eventually lead to Hawks leaving Fox. The film was finished in August 1927, though it was not released until June 1928.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=84-86}}\n\n'''''A Girl in Every Port'' (1928)'''\n\n[[File:A Girl in Every Port poster.jpg|thumb|left|''A Girl in Every Port'' poster]]\n''[[A Girl in Every Port (1928 film)|A Girl in Every Port]]'' is considered by film scholars to be the most important film of Hawks' silent career. It is the first of his films to utilize many of the Hawksian themes and characters that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first \"love story between two men,\" with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. Hawks wrote the original story and developed the screenplay with [[James Kevin McGuinness]] and Seton Miller. In the film [[Victor McLaglen]] and [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]] play two merchant seamen who are archrivals when it comes to women, with McLaglen constantly finding Armstrong's tattoo on the women that he is attempting to seduce. Eventually the two rivals become friends. [[Louise Brooks]] plays the cabaret singer with whom the two men fall in love. The film was shot from October to December 1927 and released in February 1928. It was successful in the US, and a hit in Europe where Louise Brooks was developing a cult following.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=86-91}} In France, [[Henri Langlois]] called Hawks \"the [[Walter Gropius|Gropius]] of the cinema\" and Swiss novelist and poet [[Blaise Cendrars]] said that the film \"definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=92}} Hawks went over budget once again with this film, though, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, \"This is the worst picture Fox has made in years.\"{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=91}}\n\n'''''The Air Circus'' (1928)'''\n\n''[[The Air Circus]]'' is Hawks' first film centered around [[aviation]], one of his early passions. In 1928, [[Charles Lindbergh]] was the world's most famous person and ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]'' was one of the most popular films of the year. Wanting to capitalize on the country's aviation craze, Fox immediately bought Hawks' original story for ''The Air Circus'', a variation of the male friendship plot of ''A Girl in Every Port'' about two young pilots. Officially, the original story is credited to Graham Baker and Andrew Bennison, while the screenplay was written by Seton Miller and [[Norman Z. McLeod]]. In the film, [[Arthur Lake (actor)|Arthur Lake]] and David Rollins play two eager young pilots at flight school who compete over their flight instructor's aviatrix sister, played by [[Sue Carol]]. The film was shot from April to June 1928, but Fox ordered an additional 15 minutes of dialogue footage in order that the film could compete with the new \"[[sound films|talkies]]\" being released. Hawks hated the new dialogue written by [[Hugh Herbert]] and he refused to participate in the re-shoots. The film was released in September 1928 and was a moderate hit. It is one of two films directed by Hawks that are [[lost film]]s.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=92-94}}\n\n'''''Trent's Last Case'' (1929)'''\n\n''[[Trent's Last Case (1929 film)|Trent's Last Case]]'' is an adaptation of British author [[E. C. Bentley]]'s [[Trent's Last Case|1913 novel of the same name]], which had already been adapted for cinema [[Trent's Last Case (1920 film)|in England in 1920]]. Hawks considered the novel to be \"one of the greatest detective stories of all time\" and was eager to make it his first sound film. He cast [[Raymond Griffith]] in the lead role of Phillip Trent. Griffith's throat had been damaged by poison gas during World War I and his voice was a hoarse whisper, prompting Hawks to later state, \"I thought he ought to be great in talking pictures ''because'' of that voice.\" However, after shooting only a few scenes, Fox shut Hawks down and ordered him to make a silent film, both because of Griffith's voice and because they only owned the legal rights to make a silent film. The film did have a musical score and synchronized sound effects, but no dialogue. Due to the failing business of silent films, it was never released in the US and only briefly screened in England where film critics hated it. The film was believed lost until the mid-1970s and was screened for the first time in the US at a Hawks retrospective in 1974. Hawks was in attendance of the screening and attempted to have the only print of the film destroyed.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=97-101}} Hawks' contract with Fox ended in May 1929, and he never again signed a long-term contract with a major studio. He managed to remain an independent producer-director for the rest of his long career.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=44-451}}\n[[File:Howard Hawks Hearts In Exile.jpg|thumb|Howard Hawks in 1929 or 1930]]\n\n===Early sound films: 1930\u20131934===\nBy 1930, Hollywood was in upheaval over the coming of \"talkies\" and the careers of many actors and directors were ruined. Hollywood studios were recruiting stage actors and directors that they believed were better suited for sound films. After having worked in the industry for 14 years and directed many financially successful films, Hawks found himself having to prove himself an asset to the studios once again. Leaving Fox on sour terms didn't help his reputation, but Hawks was one of the few people in Hollywood who never backed down from fights with studio heads. After several months of unemployment, Hawks renewed his career with his first sound film in 1930.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=102}}\n\nOn January 2, 1930, Hawks' brother [[Kenneth Hawks]] died while shooting the film ''[[Such Men Are Dangerous]]''.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=106-109}} Kenneth's career as a director had been gathering momentum after his debut film ''[[Big Time (1929 film)|Big Time]]'' in 1929. This sound film starred [[Lee Tracy]] and [[Mae Clarke]] and was an early example of the \"fast-talking\" sound films that would later become one of Howard Hawks' signatures.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=100-101}} ''Such Men Are Dangerous'' was based on the life [[Alfred Lowenstein]], a Belgian captain who either jumped or fell out of his plane in 1928. On January 2, Kenneth Hawks and his crew flew three aircraft (two with cameras, one with a stunt actor) over [[Santa Monica Bay]] when the two camera aircraft crashed into each other, killing 10 men. The crash was the first major on-set accident in Hollywood history and made national news. Mary Astor kept her distance from the Hawks family after Kenneth's death.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=106-110}}\n\n'''''The Dawn Patrol'' (1930)'''\n\n[[File:Dawn-Patrol-1930-Poster.jpg|thumb|''The Dawn Patrol'' movie poster]]\nHawks' first all sound film was ''[[The Dawn Patrol (1930 film)|The Dawn Patrol]]'', based on an original story by [[John Monk Saunders]] and (unofficially) Hawks. Reportedly, Hawks paid Saunders to put his name on the film, so that Hawks could direct the film without arousing concern due to his lack of writing experience.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=7}} Saunders was a flight instructor during World War I and had written ''[[Wings (1927 film)|Wings]]''. He was considered one of the most talented writers in Hollywood and was often compared to [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Accounts vary on who came up with the idea of the film, but Hawks and Saunders developed the story together and tried to sell it to several studios before First National agreed to produce it.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=102-105}} Saunders received solo screen credit for the original story and won an [[Academy Award for Best Story]] in 1930. The screenplay was written by Hawks, Seton Miller and Dan Totheroh and starred [[Richard Barthelmess]] and [[Douglas Fairbanks, Jr]]. Shooting began in late February 1930, about the same time that [[Howard Hughes]] was finally finishing his epic World War I aviation epic ''[[Hell's Angels (film)|Hell's Angels]]'', which had been in production since September 1927. Shrewdly, Hawks began to hire many of the aviation experts and cameramen that had been employed by Hughes, including [[Elmer Dyer]], Harry Reynolds and Ira Reed. When Hughes found out about the rival film, he did everything he could to sabotage ''The Dawn Patrol''. He harassed Hawks and other studio personal, hired a spy that was quickly caught and finally sued First National for copyright infringement. Hughes eventually dropped the lawsuit in late 1930\u2014he and Hawks had become good friends during the legal battle. In the film, Barthelmess and Fairbanks play two [[Royal Flying Corps]] pilots during World War I who deal with the pressure of wartime combat and constant death by drinking and fighting with their commanding officer. Filming was finished in late May 1930 and it premiered in July, setting a first-week box office record at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] in New York. The film became one of the biggest hits of 1930.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=111-115}} The success of this film allowed Hawks to gain respect in the field of filmmaking and allowed him to spend the rest of his career as an independent director without the necessity to sign any long-term contracts with specific studios.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=71}}\n\n'''''The Criminal Code'' (1931)'''\n\n[[File:Criminal Code.jpg|thumb|left|''The Criminal Code'' poster]]\nHawks did not get along with Warner Brothers executive [[Hal B. Wallis]] and his contract allowed him to be loaned out to other studios. Hawks took the opportunity to accept a directing offer from [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]]: ''[[The Criminal Code]]'', based on a successful play by [[Martin Flavin]]. Hawks and Seton Miller worked on the script with Flavin for a month and filming began in September 1930. The film starred [[Walter Huston]], [[Phillips Holmes]], [[Constance Cummings]] and [[Boris Karloff]]. Huston plays a prison warden who wants to reform the conditions of the inmates and Holmes plays a wrongly convicted prisoner who learns about the \"code\" of not ratting on other inmates. Hawks called Huston \"the greatest actor I ever worked with\".{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=118-119}} Hawks also worked with his old friend [[James Wong Howe]] for the first time as a cinematographer. The film opened in January 1931 and was a hit. The film was banned in Chicago, though, and the experience of censorship which would continue in his next film project.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=120-121}}\n\n'''''Scarface'' (1932)'''\n\nIn 1930, [[Howard Hughes]] hired Hawks to direct ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'', a gangster film loosely based on the life of Chicago mobster [[Al Capone]]. The film starred [[Paul Muni]] in the title role, with memorable supporting performances from [[George Raft]], [[Boris Karloff]], and [[Osgood Perkins]]. The film was completed in September 1931, but the censorship of the [[Hays Code]] prevented it from being released as Hawks and Hughes had originally intended. The two men fought, negotiated and made compromises with the Hays Office for over a year, until the film was eventually released in 1932, after such other pivotal early gangster films as ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' and ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]''. ''Scarface'' was the first film in which Hawks worked with screenwriter [[Ben Hecht]], who became a close friend and collaborator for 20 years.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}}\n\n'''''The Crowd Roars'' (1932)'''\n\nAfter filming was complete on ''Scarface'', Hawks left Hughes to fight the legal battles and returned to First National to fulfill his contract, this time with producer [[Darryl F. Zanuck]]. For his next film, Hawks wanted to make a film about his childhood passion: car racing. ''[[The Crowd Roars (1932 film)|The Crowd Roars]]'' is loosely based on the play ''The Barker: A Play of Carnival Life'' by [[Kenyon Nicholson]]. Hawks developed the script with Seton Miller for their eighth and final collaboration and the script was by Miller, [[Kubec Glasmon]], [[John Bright (screenwriter)|John Bright]] and [[Niven Busch]]. The film starred [[James Cagney]], [[Eric Linden]], [[Joan Blondell]] and [[Ann Dvorak]]. In the film, Cagney plays a race car driver who tries to \"protect\" his younger brother Linden, who is also a driver, from being distracted by his girlfriend, Blondell. At the same time, Cagney must hide his own neurotic girlfriend, played by Dvorak, from his younger brother. Blondell and Dvorak were initially cast in each other's roles but swapped after a few days of shooting. Shooting began on December 7, 1931 at Legion Ascot Speedway and wrapped on February 1, 1932. Hawks used real race car drivers in the film, including the [[1930 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Billy Arnold (racing driver)|Billy Arnold]].{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=156-162}} The film was released in March and became a hit.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=172}}\n\n'''''Tiger Shark'' (1932)'''\n\n[[File:Tiger Shark 1932 poster.jpg|thumb|''Tiger Shark'' poster]]\nLater in 1932, he directed ''[[Tiger Shark (film)|Tiger Shark]]'' starring [[Edward G. Robinson]] as a tuna fisherman. In these early films, Hawks established the prototypical \"Hawksian Man\", which film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] described as \"upheld by an instinctive professionalism.\"{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}} ''Tiger Shark'' demonstrated Hawks' ability to incorporate touches of humor into dramatic, tense, and even tragic story lines.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|p=172}}\n\n'''''Today We Live'' (1933)'''\n\nIn 1933, Hawks signed a three-picture deal at [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] Studios, the first of which was ''[[Today We Live]]'' in 1933, starring [[Joan Crawford]] and [[Gary Cooper]]. This [[World War I]] film was based on a [[short story]] by author [[William Faulkner]], with whom Hawks would remain friends for over 20 years.{{sfn|McCarthy|1997|pp=173-187}}\n\nHawks' next two films at MGM were the [[boxing]] drama ''[[The Prizefighter and the Lady]]'' and the [[biographical film|bio-pic]] ''[[Viva Villa!]]'', starring [[Wallace Beery]] as Mexican Revolutionary leader [[Pancho Villa]]. Studio interference on both films led Hawks to walk out on his MGM contract without completing either film himself.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}}\n\n====Later sound films====\nIn 1934, Hawks went to [[Columbia Pictures]] to make his first [[Screwball comedy film|screwball comedy]], ''[[Twentieth Century (film)|Twentieth Century]]'', starring [[John Barrymore]] and Hawks' distant cousin [[Carole Lombard]]. It was based on a stage play by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]] and, along with [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (released the same year), is considered to be the defining film of the screwball comedy genre. In 1935, Hawks made ''[[Barbary Coast (film)|Barbary Coast]]'' with [[Edward G. Robinson]] and [[Miriam Hopkins]]. Hawks collaborated with Hecht and MacArthur on ''Barbary Coast'' and reportedly convinced them to work on the film by promising to teach them a marble game. They would switch off between working on the script and playing with marbles during work days.{{sfn|Martin|1985|p=94}}{{rp|94}} In 1936, he made the aviation adventure ''[[Ceiling Zero]]'' with [[James Cagney]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]].

But he was fired by [[Samuel Goldwyn]] in the middle of shooting and the film was completed by [[William Wyler]].{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}}\n\nIn 1938, Hawks made the screwball comedy ''[[Bringing Up Baby]]'' for [[RKO Pictures]]. It starred [[Cary Grant]] and [[Katharine Hepburn]] and has been called \"the screwiest of the screwball comedies\" by film critic [[Andrew Sarris]]. Grant plays a near-sighted paleontologist who suffers one humiliation after another due to the lovestruck socialite played by Hepburn.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}} Hawks' artistic direction for ''Bringing Up Baby'' revolved around the raw natural chemistry between Grant and Hepburn. With Grant portraying the paleontologist and Hepburn as an heiress, the roles only add to the movie's purpose of disintegrating the line between the real and the imaginary.{{sfn|Willis|1975}}''Bringing Up Baby'' was a box office flop when initially released and, subsequently, RKO fired Hawks due to extreme losses; however, the film has become regarded as one of Hawks' masterpieces.{{sfn|Laham|2009|pp=27-29}} Hawks followed this with the aviation drama ''[[Only Angels Have Wings]]'', again starring [[Cary Grant]] and made in 1939 for [[Columbia Pictures]]. It also starred [[Jean Arthur]], [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]], [[Rita Hayworth]], and [[Richard Barthelmess]].{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}}\n\n[[File:His Girl Friday still 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cary Grant]], [[Rosalind Russell]] and [[Ralph Bellamy]] in ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940)]]\n\nIn 1940, Hawks returned to the screwball comedy genre with ''[[His Girl Friday]]'', starring [[Cary Grant]] and [[Rosalind Russell]]. The film was an adaptation of the hit Broadway play ''[[The Front Page]]'' by [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]],{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}} which had already been made into a [[The Front Page (1931 film)|film in 1931]] and had also been reworked by the same screenwriters and transplanted to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s India for ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' in 1939.{{sfn|Moss|2015|p=57}} Not forgetting the influence Jesse Lasky had on his early career, in 1941, Hawks made ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'', starring [[Gary Cooper]] as a pacifist farmer who becomes a decorated [[World War I]] soldier. Hawks directed the film and cast Cooper as a specific favor to Lasky.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=7}} This was the highest-grossing film of 1941 and won two [[Academy Awards]] ([[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Editing]]), as well as earning Hawks his only nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]. Later that year, Hawks worked with Cooper again for ''[[Ball of Fire]]'', which also starred [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. The film was written by [[Billy Wilder]] and [[Charles Brackett]] and is a playful take on ''[[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. Cooper plays a sheltered, intellectual linguist who is writing an encyclopedia with six other scientists, and hires street-wise Stanwyck to help them with modern slang terms. In 1941, Hawks began work on the [[Howard Hughes]]-produced (and later directed) film ''[[The Outlaw]]'', based on the life of [[Billy the Kid]] and starring [[Jane Russell]]. Hawks completed initial shooting of the film in early 1941, but due to perfectionism and battles with the Hollywood [[Production Code]], Hughes continued to re-shoot and re-edit the film until 1943, when it was finally released with Hawks uncredited as director.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}}\n\nAfter making the [[World War II]] film ''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'' in 1943 starring [[John Garfield]], Hawks did two films with real-life lovers [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]]. ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'', made in 1944, stars Bogart, Bacall and [[Walter Brennan]] and is based on a novel by [[Ernest Hemingway]]. Hawks was a close friend of Hemingway and made a bet with the author that he could make a good film out of Hemingway's \"worst book.\" Hawks, [[William Faulkner]] and [[Jules Furthman]] collaborated on the script about an American fishing boat captain working out of French Martinique in the Caribbean and various situations of espionage after the [[Fall of France]] in 1940. Bogart and Bacall fell in love on the set of the film and married soon afterwards. ''To Have and Have Not'' has been critiqued as having a \"rambling, slapped-together feel\" that contribute to an overall clumsy and dull movie.{{sfn|Willis|1975|p=60}} The film, however, has also been enjoyed for its romantic plot and has been compared to Casablanca in its feel.{{sfn|McBride|1972|p=2}} The greatest strength of the movie has been said to come from its atmosphere and use of wit that really plays on the strengths of Bacall and helps the movie solidify the theme of beauty in perpetual opposition.{{sfn|Willis|1975|p=74}} Hawks reteamed with Bogart and Bacall in 1946 with ''[[The Big Sleep (1946 film)|The Big Sleep]]'', based on the [[Philip Marlowe]] detective novel by [[Raymond Chandler]].{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}}\n\nIn 1948, Hawks made ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', an epic western reminiscent of ''[[Mutiny on the Bounty]]'' starring [[John Wayne]] and [[Montgomery Clift]] in his first film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film ''[[Ball of Fire]]'' as ''[[A Song Is Born]]'', this time starring [[Danny Kaye]] and [[Virginia Mayo]]. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular [[jazz]] music and includes such jazz legends as [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Lionel Hampton]], and [[Benny Carter]] playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy ''[[I Was a Male War Bride]]'', also starring [[Ann Sheridan]].{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}}\n\n[[File:Film1951-TheThingFromAnotherWorld-OriginalPoster.jpg|thumb|''The Thing From Another World'' poster]]\nIn 1951, Hawks produced, and some believe essentially directed, a science-fiction film, ''[[The Thing from Another World]]''.

Film critic John Belton called the film Hawks' \"most organic comedy.\"{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}} Hawks' third film of 1952 was a contribution to the omnibus film ''[[O.

In 1955, Hawks shot a film atypical within the context of his other work, ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'', which is a [[sword-and-sandal]] epic about ancient Egypt that stars [[Jack Hawkins]] and [[Joan Collins]]. The film was Hawks' final collaboration with longtime friend William Faulkner before the author's death. In 1959, Hawks worked with [[John Wayne]] in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'', also starring [[Dean Martin]], [[Ricky Nelson]], and [[Walter Brennan]] as four lawmen \"defending the fort\" of their local jail in which a local criminal is awaiting a trial while his family attempt to break him out.

Hawks's knowledge of mechanics allowed him to built the camera-car hybrid that allowed him to film the hunting scenes in the film.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=6}} In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, ''[[Man's Favorite Sport?]]'', starring [[Rock Hudson]] (since Cary Grant felt he was too old for the role) and [[Paula Prentiss]]. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with ''[[Red Line 7000]]'' in 1965, featuring a young [[James Caan]] in his first leading role. Hawks' final two films were both Western remakes of ''Rio Bravo'' starring John Wayne. In 1966, Hawks directed ''[[El Dorado (1966 film)|El Dorado]]'', starring Wayne, [[Robert Mitchum]], and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made ''[[Rio Lobo]]'', with Wayne in 1970.{{sfn|Wakeman|1987|pp=446-451}} After ''Rio Lobo'', Hawks planned a project relating to Ernest Hemingway and \"Now, Mr. Gus,\" a comedy about two male friends seeking oil and money.

Hawks credited himself with the discovery of William Faulkner and introducing the then-unknown writer to the [[Algonquin Round Table]].{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=8}} Hawks and Faulkner had mutual interests in flying and drinking and Faulkner admired the films of Hawks, asking him to teach him how to write screenplays. Faulkner wrote five screenplays for Hawks, the first of them being ''[[Today We Live]]'' and the last of them being ''Land of the Pharaohs''.{{sfn|Mast|1982|p=10}} With a mutual interest in fishing and skiing, Hawks was also close with Ernest Hemingway, and was almost made the director of the [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|film adaptation]] of ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''. Hawks found it difficult to forgive Hemingway for his suicide. After coming to terms with his decision in the 1970s, he began to plan a film project about Hemingway and his relationship with [[Robert Capa]]. He never filmed the project.{{sfn|Mast|1982|pp=10-11}}\n\n==Style==\n[[File:Bacall&Hawks.jpg|thumb|right|Hawks and [[Lauren Bacall]], 1943]]\nHawks was a versatile director whose career includes comedies, dramas, gangster films, science fiction, film noir, and Westerns.

Retrieved: July 1, 2016.</ref>\n\nDespite Hawks' work in a variety of Hollywood genres, he still retained an independent sensibility. Film critic [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] wrote of Hawks: \"Far from being the meek purveyor of Hollywood forms, he always chose to turn them upside down. ''To Have and Have Not'' and ''The Big Sleep'', ostensibly an adventure and a thriller, are really love stories. ''Rio Bravo'', apparently a Western \u2013 everyone wears a cowboy hat \u2013 is a comedy conversation piece. The ostensible comedies are shot through with exposed emotions, with the subtlest views of the sex war, and with a wry acknowledgment of the incompatibility of men and women.\"{{sfn|Thomson|1994|p=322}} David Boxwell argues that the filmmaker's body of work \"has been accused of a historical and adolescent escapism, but Hawks' fans rejoice in his oeuvre's remarkable avoidance of Hollywood's religiosity, bathos, flag-waving, and sentimentality.<ref>Boxwell, David.

Retrieved: July 1, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Writing and producing===\nIn addition to his career as a film director, Howard Hawks either wrote or supervised the writing for most of his films. In some cases, he would rewrite parts of the script on-set. Due to the Screen Writer's Guild's rule that the director and producer couldn't receive credit for writing, Hawks rarely received credit. Even though [[Sidney Howard]] received credit for writing ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' (1939), the screenplay was actually written by a myriad of Hollywood screenwriters including, [[David O. Selznick]], [[Ben Hecht]], and Howard Hawks. Hawks was an uncredited contributor to many other screenplays such as ''[[Underworld (1927 film)|Underworld]]'' (1927), ''[[Morocco (film)|Morocco]]'' (1930), ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932), and ''[[Gunga Din (film)|Gunga Din]]'' (1939). Hawks also produced many of his own films, preferring not to work under major film studios, because it allowed him creative freedom in his writing, directing, and casting. Hawks would sometimes walk out on films that he wasn't producing himself. Hawks, however, never considered producing to come before his directing. For example, several of the film cards for his films show \"Directed and produced by Howard Hawks\" with \"produced\" underneath \"directed\" in much smaller font. Sometimes his films wouldn't credit any producer. Hawks is credited as discovering many well known film stars such as Paul Muni, George Raft, Ann Dvorak, Carole Lombard, Frances Farmer, Jane Russell, Montgomery Cliff, Joanne Dru, Angie Dickinson, James Caan, and most famously Lauren Bacall.{{sfn|Mast|1982|pp=8-9, 28}}\n\n==Legacy==\nIn the 1950s, Eugene Archer, a film fan, was planning on writing a book on important American film directors such as John Ford. However, after reading ''Cahiers du Cinema'', Archer learned that the French film scene was more interested in Alfred Hitchcock and Howard Hawks. Books were not written on Hawks until the sixties and a full biography on Hawks wasn't published until 1997, twenty years after his death.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=2}} Film critic [[Andrew Sarris]] cited Howard Hawks as \"the least known and least unappreciated Hollywood director of any stature\".{{sfn|Sarris|1968|p=53}} According to professor of film studies Ian Brookes, Hawks is not as well known as other directors, because of his lack of association with a particular genre such as Ford with Western and Hitchcock with thriller. Hawks worked across many genres including gangster, film noir, musical comedy, romantic comedy, screwball comedy, Western, aviation, and combat. Moreover, Hawks preferred not to associate with major studios during his film production. He worked for all major studios at least once on short term contract, but many of his films were produced under his own name.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=2}} The simplicity of his narratives and stories may also have contributed to his under-recognition.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=2}} Commercially, his films were successful, but he received little critical acclaim except for one Academy Award nomination for Best Director for ''Sergeant York'' (he lost to John Ford for ''[[How Green Was My Valley (film)|How Green Was My Valley]]'', and an Honorary Academy Award presented to him two years before his death.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=4}}\n\nSome critics limit Hawks by his action films, describing Hawks as a director who produced films with a \"masculine bias\", however action scenes in Hawks's films were often left to second-unit directors and Hawks actually preferred to work indoors.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=4}} Howard Hawks's style is difficult to interpret, because there is no recognizable relationship between his visual and narrative style as in the films of his contemporary directors. Because his camera style was derived more from his working method rather than anecdotal or visual realization, his camera work is unobtrusive, making his films appear to have little to no cinematographic style.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=4}} Hawks's style can, rather, by characterized as improvisational and collaborative.{{sfn|Brookes|2016|p=5}} Hawks' directorial style and the use of natural, conversational dialogue in his films are cited as major influences on many noted filmmakers, including [[Robert Altman]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Howard Hawks|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001328/bio|website=IMDb|accessdate=20 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128211106/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001328/bio|archivedate=28 January 2017|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> [[John Carpenter]],<ref>{{cite web|title=John Carpenter: 10 modern films inspired by the genre master|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/john-carpenter-10-modern-films-inspired-genre-master|website=British Film Institute|accessdate=20 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170310032632/http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/john-carpenter-10-modern-films-inspired-genre-master|archivedate=10 March 2017|language=en}}</ref> and [[Quentin Tarantino]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Child|first1=Ben|title=Why Quentin Tarantino wants to be the next Howard Hawks|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/12/quentin-tarantino-bafta|website=The Guardian|accessdate=20 September 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170604022814/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jan/12/quentin-tarantino-bafta|archivedate=4 June 2017|date=12 January 2010}}</ref> His work is also admired by many notable directors including [[Peter Bogdanovich]], [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Michael Mann (director)|Michael Mann]]<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">Horne, Philip.

You do not need to register to do this. Anyone who has edited is known as a \"[[Wikipedia: Wikipedian|''Wikipedian'']]\" (commonly referred to as, simply, editors) and, no matter how trivial the edit may seem, can be proud that they have helped make Wikipedia what it is. All of these edits add up!  Wikipedia uses two methods of editing: the new [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] (VE), and classic editing through [[Help:Wiki markup|wiki markup]] (wikitext).  <!-- Comment - Good luck with your first edit. -->\n\nSome pages are [[WP:Protection policy|protected from editing]]. These pages are denoted by a lock icon on the top right of the page and, if you are not allowed to edit the page, it will have a \"View&nbsp;source\" tab instead of an \"Edit\" tab. You can still edit these pages indirectly, by submitting an [[Wikipedia:Edit requests|edit request]]\u2014an editor with the ability to edit the protected page will respond to your request. You can submit a request by clicking on the \"View&nbsp;source\" tab on that page and using the \"Submit an edit request\" link at the bottom right.\n\n== Editing articles ==\n:''See also: [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Editing]] and [[Help:Introduction to editing (VE)/1|Help:Editing with VisualEditor ]]''\n\n=== Content protocols ===\n{{see|Wikipedia:Core content policies}}\n\nWhen adding content and creating new articles, an [[Wikipedia:Encyclopedic style|encyclopedic style]] with a [[WP:TONE|formal tone]] is important. Instead of essay-like, argumentative, or opinionated writing, Wikipedia articles should have a straightforward, [[Wikipedia:Summary style|just-the-facts]] style. The goal of a Wikipedia article is to create a comprehensive and [[WP:NPOV|neutrally written]] summary of existing mainstream knowledge about a topic. Accordingly, Wikipedia does not publish [[WP:NOR|original research]]. An encyclopedia is, by its nature, a [[tertiary source]] that provides a survey of information already the subject of publication in the wider world. Ideally, all information should be [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|cited]] and [[WP:Verify|verifiable]]  by [[Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources|reliable sources]]. Sourcing requirements are significantly stricter in [[WP:BLP|articles on living persons]].\n\n=== Edit screen(s) ===\n{{seealso|Wikipedia:Tutorial/Editing}}\n\nEditing most Wikipedia pages is quite simple. Wikipedia uses two methods of editing: classic editing through [[Help:Wiki markup|wiki markup]] (wikitext) and through a new [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]] (VE). Wiki markup editing is chosen by clicking the <kbd>Edit</kbd> tab at the top of a Wikipedia page (or on a [[Wikipedia: Section|section-edit link]]). This will take you to a new page containing the editable contents of the current page. Wiki markup is used extensively throughout Wikipedia for such things as [[Help:Link|hyperlinks]], [[Help:Table|tables]] and [[Help:Columns|columns]], [[Help:Footnotes|footnotes]], [[Wikipedia:Inline citation|inline citation]], [[Help:Special characters|special characters]] and so on.\n\nThe VisualEditor option is intended as a user-friendly, [[WYSIWYG|\"What You See Is What You Get\"]] (WYSIWYG) editing aid allowing one to edit pages without the need to learn wikitext markup. It is only available to registered logged-in users through an opt-in choice available through [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-betafeatures|personal preferences]], see the [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor/User guide|VisualEditor user guide]] for more information.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" class=\"center\" heights=\"233\" caption=\"Two editing environments: wikitext and VisualEditor\" style=\"font-size:95%\">\nFile:How to edit a page Edit box.png|alt=Text in a large rectangle below two toolbars and next to a scrollbar.|Edit box showing the [[Help:wiki markup|wikitext markup]] (screenshot from 2012). You can change the formatting and contents of the page by changing what is written in this box.\nFile:Wikipedia article in VisualEditor 2018-02-12.png|Screenshot showing the same article in [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]. Unlike the wiki markup display, VisualEditor will show the text being edited almost as if it were already published.\n</gallery>\n\nThe Wikipedia community has developed [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|style guidelines]] to make articles and facts appear in a standardized form, and Wikipedia easier to use as a whole. A basic list of [[Help:Wiki markup|wiki markup]] can be found on the [[Help:Cheatsheet|cheatsheet]]. An [[Help:Edit toolbar|\"edit toolbar\"]] is provided just above the edit box (pictured below), which will allow logged-in users (by selecting the option in [[Special:Preferences#mw-prefsection-gadgets|personal preferences]]) to automatically place and format various aspects of wiki code. See [[Help:Wiki markup]] for more information, remember that you can't break Wikipedia, and, although there are many protocols, [[WP:PERFECTION|perfection is not required]], as [[WP:WIP|Wikipedia is a work in progress]].\n\n[[File:Advanced toolbar of vector skin.png|center]]\n\nWhen you have finished editing, you should write a short [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]] in the small field below the edit box (pictured below). You may use shorthand to describe your changes, as described in the [[Wikipedia:Edit summary legend|legend]]. To see how the page looks with your edits, press the \"'''Show preview'''\" button. To see the differences between the page with your edits and the previous version of the page press the \"'''Show changes'''\" button. If you're satisfied with what you see, '''[[Wikipedia:Be bold|be bold]]''' and press the \"'''Publish changes'''\" button. Your changes will immediately be visible to all Wikipedia users.\n{{EditOptions|align=center|width=50em|font-size=80%}}\nNote: Do not sign the edit summary line with your <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki> signature, as it does not work there.\n\n==== Minor edits ====\n{{further|Help:Minor edit}}\n\n[[File:Minor edit.png|thumb|upright|The \"minor edit\" checkbox (circled) in the wikitext editor]]\n\nA check to the \"minor edit\" box signifies that only superficial differences exist between the version with your edit and the previous version: typo corrections, formatting and presentational changes, rearranging of text without modifying content, etc. A ''minor edit'' is a version that the editor believes requires no review and could never be the subject of a dispute. The \"minor edit\" option is one of several [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?#New editing options|options]] available only to [[Help:Logging in|registered users]]. Editors should not feel that marking a change as minor devalues their effort.\n\n==== Major edits ====\n{{see|Wikipedia:Editing policy#Talking and editing}}\n\nAll editors are encouraged to [[Wikipedia:Be bold|be bold]], but there are several things that a user can do to ensure that major edits are performed smoothly. Before engaging in a major edit, a user should consider discussing proposed changes on the article discussion/talk page. During the edit, if doing so over an extended period, the {{tlx|In use}} tag can reduce the likelihood of an edit conflict. Once the edit has been completed, the inclusion of an [[Help:Edit summary|edit summary]] will assist in documenting the changes. These steps will help all to ensure that major edits are well received by the Wikipedia community.\n\nA major edit should be reviewed to confirm that it is consensual to all concerned editors. Therefore, any change that affects the ''meaning'' of an article is major (not minor), even if the edit is a single word.\n\nThere are no necessary terms to which you have to agree when doing major edits, but the preceding recommendations have become best practice. If you do it your own way, the likelihood of your edits being reedited may be higher.\n\n<!-- Place below here or in intro? -->\nWhen performing a large edit, it is suggested that you periodically, and before pressing \"Publish changes\", copy your edits into an external text editor (preferably one without formatting, such as [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]]). This ensures that in the case of a browser crash you will not lose your work. If you are adding substantial amounts of work, it is also a good idea to publish changes in stages.\n\n=== Adding references ===\n{{see|Wikipedia:Referencing for beginners|Wikipedia:Citing sources}}\n:'' Introductions: [[Help:Introduction to referencing|Help:Introduction to referencing (Wiki Markup)]]  and   [[Help:Introduction to referencing (VE)/1|Help:Introduction to referencing (VisualEditor)]]''\n[[File:Citing sources tutorial, part 1.ogv|thumb|upright|A screencast that walks through the essentials needed in citing your sources. <small>(2:01&nbsp;min)</small>]]\n[[File:RefTools rework.ogv|thumb|right|upright|A screencast that walks through how to use the various features of RefTools. <small>(5:03&nbsp;min)</small>]] \n\nGenerally, sources are added directly after the facts they support at the end of the sentence and after any punctuation. Wikipedia permits editors to use any citation system that allows the reader to understand where the information came from, and strongly encourages use of [[Wikipedia:Inline citation|inline citations]] to do so. Common methods of placing inline citations include [[Wikipedia:Footnotes|footnotes]], [[Help:Shortened footnotes|shortened footnotes]] and [[Wikipedia:Harvard references|parenthetical references]].\n\nInline citations are most commonly placed by inserting a reference between <code><nowiki><ref></nowiki></code> ... <code><nowiki></ref></nowiki></code> tags, directly in the text of an article.

The victory of the Germanic tribes in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]] ([[AD]] 9) prevented annexation by the [[Roman Empire]], although the [[Roman provinces]] of [[Germania Superior]] and [[Germania Inferior]] were established along the [[Rhine]]. Following the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire]], the [[Franks]] conquered the other [[West Germanic languages|West]] [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. When the [[Francia|Frankish Empire]] was divided among [[Charles the Great]]'s heirs in 843, the eastern part became [[East Francia]]. In 962, [[Otto I]] became the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the medieval German state.\n\nIn the [[Late Middle Ages]], the regional dukes, princes and bishops gained power at the expense of the emperors. [[Martin Luther]] led the [[Protestant Reformation]] against the Catholic Church after 1517, as the northern states became Protestant, while the southern states remained as the Catholics. The two parts of the Holy Roman Empire clashed in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), which was ruinous to the twenty million civilians living in both parts. The Thirty Years' War brought tremendous destruction to Germany; more than 1/4 of the population and 1/2 of the male population in the German states were killed by the catastrophic war. 1648 marked the effective end of the Holy Roman Empire and the beginning of the modern nation-state system, with Germany divided into numerous independent states, such as [[Prussia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], [[Austria]] and other states, which also controlled land outside of the area considered as \"Germany\".\n\nAfter the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] from 1803\u20131815, feudalism fell away and liberalism and nationalism clashed with reaction. The German revolutions of 1848\u201349 failed. The [[Industrial Revolution]] modernized the German economy, led to the rapid growth of cities and to the emergence of the [[History of socialism|Socialist movement]] in Germany. Prussia, with its capital [[Berlin]], grew in power. German universities became world-class centers for science and  humanities, while music and art flourished. The [[Unification of Germany]] (excluding Austria and the German-speaking areas of Switzerland) was achieved under the leadership of the Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] with the formation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 which solved the ''[[German question|Kleindeutsche L\u00f6sung]]'', the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or ''Gro\u00dfdeutsche L\u00f6sung'', the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria), the former prevailing. The new ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'', an elected parliament, had only a limited role in the imperial government. Germany joined the other powers in [[German colonial empire|colonial expansion in Africa and the Pacific.]]\n\nGermany was the dominant power on the continent. By 1900, its rapidly expanding industrial economy passed Britain's, allowing a naval race. Germany led the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918) against France, Great Britain, Russia and (by 1917) the United States. Defeated and partly occupied, Germany was forced to pay [[war reparations]] by the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and was stripped of its colonies as well as areas given to re-established Poland and [[Alsace-Lorraine]]. The [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]] deposed the emperor and the various kings and princes, leading to the establishment of the [[Weimar Republic]], an unstable parliamentary democracy.\n\nIn the early 1930s, the worldwide [[Great Depression]] hit Germany hard, as unemployment soared and people lost confidence in the government. In January 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]]. The [[Nazi Party]] then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hitler quickly established a [[totalitarian]] regime. Beginning in the late 1930s, [[Nazi Germany]] made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if they were not met. First came the [[remilitarization of the Rhineland]] in 1936, the annexing of Austria in the ''[[Anschluss]]'' and parts of Czechoslovakia with the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938 (although in 1939 Hitler [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|annexed further territory of Czechoslovakia]]). On 1 September 1939, Germany initiated [[World War II]] in Europe with the [[invasion of Poland]]. After forming a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|pact with the Soviet Union]] in 1939, Hitler and Stalin divided Eastern Europe. After a \"[[Phoney War]]\" in spring 1940, the Germans swept Denmark and Norway, the Low Countries and France, giving Germany control of nearly all of Western Europe. Hitler [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in June 1941.\n\nRacism, especially [[antisemitism]], was a central feature of the regime. In Germany, but predominantly in the [[German-occupied Europe|German-occupied areas]], the systematic [[genocide]] program known as [[The Holocaust]] killed six million Jews, as well as five million others including German dissidents, gipsies, disabled people, Poles, Romanies, Soviets (Russian and non-Russian), and others. In 1942, the German invasion of the Soviet Union faltered, and after the [[Military history of the United States during World War II|United States had entered the war]], Britain became the base for massive [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Anglo-American bombings]] of German cities. Germany fought the war on multiple [[Front (military)|fronts]] through 1942\u20131944, however following the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]] (June 1944), the German Army was pushed back on all fronts until the final collapse in May 1945.\n\nUnder [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupation]] by the Allies, German territories were split up, Austria was again made a separate country, [[denazification]] took place, and the [[Cold War]] resulted in the division of the country into democratic [[Germany|West Germany]] and communist [[East Germany]]. Millions of ethnic Germans were deported or fled from Communist areas into West Germany, which experienced rapid [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic expansion]], and became the dominant economy in Western Europe. West Germany was rearmed in the 1950s under the auspices of [[NATO]], but without access to nuclear weapons. The [[France\u2013Germany relations|Franco-German friendship]] became the basis for the political integration of Western Europe in the [[European Union]]. In 1989, the [[Berlin Wall]] was destroyed, the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed and East Germany was [[Reunification of Germany|reunited with West Germany]] in 1990. In 1998\u20131999, Germany was one of the founding countries of the [[eurozone]]. Germany remains one of the economic powerhouses of Europe, contributing about one quarter of the eurozone's annual [[gross domestic product]]. In the early 2010s, Germany played a critical role in trying to resolve the escalating euro crisis, especially with regard to Greece and other [[Southern European]] nations. In the middle of the decade, the country faced the [[European migrant crisis]], as the main receiver of asylum seekers from [[Syria]] and other troubled regions.\n\n''For more events, see [[Timeline of German history]].''\n\n==Prehistory==\n[[Image:Homo steinheimensis, holotype.jpg|thumb|upright|The Steinheim Skull is at least 250,000 years old]]\nThe discovery of the [[Mauer 1]] mandible in 1907 shows that ancient humans were present in Germany at least 600,000 years ago.{{sfn|Wagner|2010|pp=19726\u201319730}} The oldest complete hunting weapons ever found anywhere in the world were discovered in a coal mine in Schoningen, Germany in 1995 where three 380,000-year-old wooden javelins 6\u20137.5 feet (1.8\u20132.3 meter) long were unearthed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/9705/newsbriefs/spears.html|title=World's Oldest Spears \u2013 Archaeology Magazine Archive|work=archaeology.org}}</ref> The [[Neander]] valley in Germany was the location where the first ever non-modern human fossil was discovered and recognised in 1856; the new species of human was named [[Neanderthal]] man.

That this may have begun early, before the expansion of the Slavs from their primeval habitat, is implied by the presence of individual loan-words in a wide range of Slavonic languages.\"}}\n\nResearchers know few details of early Germanic activity, except through the tribes' recorded interactions with the [[Roman Empire]], through etymological research and from archaeological finds.{{sfn|Claster|1982|p=35}}\n\nIn the first years of the 1st century AD Roman legions conducted a long campaign in Germania, the area north of the Upper [[Danube]] and east of the [[Rhine]], in an attempt to expand the Empire's frontiers and to shorten its frontier line. Rome subdued several Germanic tribes, such as the [[Cherusci]]. The tribes became familiar with Roman tactics of warfare while maintaining their tribal identity. In 9 AD a Cherusci chieftain known to the Romans as [[Arminius]] defeated a Roman army in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]], a victory credited with stopping the Roman advance into Germanic territories and marking the beginning of recorded German history.{{sfn|Smithsonian (September 2005)}}{{sfn|Ozment|2005|pp=2\u201321}}{{qn|date=August 2015}} That part of the territory of modern Germany that lay east of the [[Rhine]] remained outside the Roman Empire. By AD 100, the time of [[Tacitus]]'s ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]'', Germanic tribes had settled along the Roman frontier along the Rhine and the Danube (the ''[[Limes Germanicus]]''), occupying most of the area of modern Germany; however, imperial Rome organised territory later included in the modern states of Austria, [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]], southern [[Bavaria]], southern [[Hesse]], [[Saarland]] and the [[Rhineland]] as Roman provinces ([[Noricum]],{{sfn|Fichtner|2009|p=xlviii|ps=: \"When the Romans began to appear in the region, shortly before the beginning of the Christian era, they turned Noricum into an administrative province, which encompassed much of what today is Austria.\"}} [[Raetia]],<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hg7AQAAMAAJ|journal=The Journal of the Anthropological Society of Bombay|date=1917|volume= 10|p=647|quote=[...] Raetia (modern Bavaria and the adjoining country) [...].}}</ref> and [[Germania]]{{sfn|Ramirez-Faria|2007|p=267|ps=: \"Provinces of Germany[:] Germania was the name of two Roman provinces on the left bank of the Rhine, but also the general Roman designation for the lands east of the Rhine.\"}}).

Germanic widows required a male guardian to represent them in court. Unlike [[Anglo-Saxon law]] or the [[Visigothic Code]], Salic law barred women from royal succession. Social status was based on military and biological roles, a reality demonstrated in rituals associated with newborns, when female infants were given a lesser value than male infants.

By then, the emperors had lost their influence in Italy and Burgundy. In 1525, the Heilbronn reform plan \u2013 the most advanced document of the [[German Peasants' War]] (''Deutscher Bauernkrieg'') \u2013 referred to the ''Reich'' as ''von Teutscher Nation'' (of German nation).\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Hildegard von Bingen.jpg|[[Hildegard von Bingen]] (1098\u20131179)\nFile:Codex Manesse Walther von der Vogelweide.jpg|[[Walther von der Vogelweide]] (c. 1170\u20131230)\nFile:Gutenberg.jpg|[[Johannes Gutenberg]] (c. 1398\u20131468)\nFile:Durer selfporitrait.jpg|[[Albrecht D\u00fcrer]] (1471\u20131528)\n</gallery>\n\n==Early modern Germany==\n{{Main|Early Modern history of Germany|18th century history of Germany}}\n:''See [[List of states in the Holy Roman Empire]] for subdivisions and the political structure''\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|right|250px|The Holy Roman Empire, 1512]]\n\n===Reformation===\nIn the early 16th century there was much discontent occasioned by abuses such as [[indulgence]]s in the Catholic Church, and a general desire for reform.\n\nIn 1517 the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] began with the publication of [[Martin Luther]]'s [[95 Theses]]; he posted them in the town square and gave copies of them to German nobles, but it is debated whether he nailed them to the church door in [[Wittenberg]] as is commonly said. The list detailed 95 assertions Luther believed to show corruption and misguidance within the Catholic Church. One often cited example, though perhaps not Luther's chief concern, is a condemnation of the selling of [[indulgences]]; another prominent point within the 95 Theses is Luther's disagreement both with the way in which the higher clergy, especially the pope, used and abused power, and with the very idea of the pope.\n\n[[File:Banner of the Holy Roman Emperor (after 1400).svg|thumb|left|Flag of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], 15th to 19th centuries]]\n\nIn 1521 Luther was outlawed at the [[Diet of Worms]]. But the Reformation spread rapidly, helped by the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]]'s wars with France and the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]]. Hiding in the [[Wartburg Castle]], Luther translated the Bible from Latin to German, establishing the basis of the German language. A curious fact is that Luther spoke a dialect which had minor importance in the German language of that time. After the publication of his Bible, his dialect suppressed the others and evolved into what is now the modern German.\n\n[[File:Lucas Cranach d.\u00c4. - Martin Luther, 1528 (Veste Coburg).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Martin Luther]] 1528, by Lucas Cranach the Elder]]\n\nIn 1524 the [[German Peasants' War]] broke out in [[Swabia]], [[Franconia]] and [[Thuringia]] against ruling princes and lords, following the preaching of Reformers. But the revolts, which were assisted by war-experienced noblemen like [[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] and [[Florian Geyer]] (in Franconia), and by the theologian [[Thomas M\u00fcnzer]] (in Thuringia), were soon repressed by the territorial princes.

The main force was provided by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit order]], founded by the Spaniard [[Ignatius of Loyola]]. Central and northeastern Germany were by this time almost wholly Protestant, whereas western and southern Germany remained predominantly Catholic. In 1547, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V defeated the [[Schmalkaldic League]], an alliance of Protestant rulers.<ref>John Lotherington, ''The Counter-Reformation'' (2015)</ref> The [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555 brought recognition of the Lutheran faith. But the treaty also stipulated that the religion of a state was to be that of its ruler ([[Cuius regio, eius religio]]).\n\nIn 1608/1609 the [[Protestant Union]] and the [[Catholic League (German)|Catholic League]] were formed.\n\n=== Thirty Years War, 1618\u20131648 ===\n[[File:Bev\u00f6lkerkungsr\u00fcckgang im HRRDN nach dem Drei\u00dfigj\u00e4hrigen Krieg.PNG|thumb|Reduction of the population of the Holy Roman Empire as a consequence of the [[Thirty Years War]]]]\n\nFrom 1618 to 1648 the [[Thirty Years' War]] raged in the Holy Roman Empire. Its causes were the conflicts between Catholics and Protestants, the efforts by the various states within the Empire to increase their power, and the Catholic Emperor's attempt to achieve the religious and political unity of the Empire. The immediate occasion for the war was the uprising of the Protestant nobility of Bohemia against the emperor, but the conflict was widened into a European war by the intervention of [[Christian IV of Denmark|King Christian IV of Denmark]] (1625\u201329), [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] (1630\u201348) and France under [[Cardinal Richelieu]]. Germany became the main theatre of war and the scene of the final conflict between France and the Habsburgs for predominance in Europe.<ref>{{cite book | first=Peter H. |last=Wilson | title=The Thirty Years War: Europe's Tragedy | year=2009}}</ref>\n\nThe fighting often was out of control, with marauding bands of hundreds or thousands of starving soldiers spreading plague, plunder, and murder. The armies that were under control moved back and forth across the countryside year after year, levying heavy taxes on cities, and seizing the animals and food stocks of the peasants without payment. The enormous social disruption over three decades caused a dramatic decline in population because of killings, disease, crop failures, declining birth rates and random destruction, and the out-migration of terrified people. One estimate shows a 38% drop from 16 million people in 1618 to 10 million by 1650, while another shows \"only\" a 20% drop from 20 million to 16 million. The [[Altmark]] and [[History of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] regions were especially hard hit. It took generations for Germany to fully recover.<ref>Geoffrey Parker, ''The Thirty Years' War'' (1997) p. 178 has 15\u201320% decline; Tryntje Helfferich, ''The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History'' (2009) p. xix, estimates a 25% decline. Wilson (2009) pp. 780\u201395 reviews the estimates.</ref>\n\nThe war ended in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. [[Alsace]] was permanently lost to France, [[Pomerania]] was temporarily lost to Sweden, and the Netherlands officially left the Empire. Imperial power declined further as the states' rights were increased.\n\n===Culture and literacy===\n[[Image:Lutherbibel.jpg|thumb|Bible translated into Modern High German by Luther, 1534]]\n\nThe German population reached about twenty million people, the great majority of whom were peasant farmers.<ref name=holborn-reform>{{cite book | first=Hajo | last=Holborn |title=A History of Germany: The Reformation | year=1959 | pages= 37}}</ref>\n\nThe Reformation was a triumph of literacy and the new printing press. Luther's translation of the Bible into German was a decisive moment in the spread of literacy, and stimulated as well the printing and distribution of religious books and pamphlets. From 1517 onward religious pamphlets flooded Germany and much of Europe. By 1530 over 10,000 publications are known, with a total of ten million copies. The Reformation was thus a media revolution. Luther strengthened his attacks on Rome by depicting a \"good\" against \"bad\" church. From there, it became clear that print could be used for propaganda in the Reformation for particular agendas. Reform writers used pre-Reformation styles, clich\u00e9s, and stereotypes and changed items as needed for their own purposes.<ref>{{cite book | first=Mark U. | last=Edwards, Jr. | title=Printing, Propaganda, and Martin Luther | year=1994}}</ref> Especially effective were Luther's ''Small Catechism'', for use of parents teaching their children, and ''Larger Catechism,'' for pastors.<ref>See texts at [http://www.projectwittenberg.org/pub/resources/text/wittenberg/wittenberg-luther.html#sw-hymn Project Wittenberg: \"Selected Hymns of Martin Luther\"]</ref> Using the German vernacular they expressed the Apostles' Creed in simpler, more personal, Trinitarian language. Illustrations in the newly translated Bible and in many tracts popularized Luther's ideas. [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] (1472\u20131553), the great painter patronized by the electors of Wittenberg, was a close friend of Luther, and illustrated Luther's theology for a popular audience. He dramatized Luther's views on the relationship between the Old and New Testaments, while remaining mindful of Luther's careful distinctions about proper and improper uses of visual imagery.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Christoph |last=Weimer |title=Luther and Cranach on Justification in Word and Image | journal=Lutheran Quarterly | year=2004 | volume =18 |issue=4 |pages=387\u2013405}}</ref>\n\nLuther's German translation of the Bible was also decisive for the [[German language]] and its evolution from [[Early New High German]] to Modern Standard. His bible promoted the development of non-local forms of language and exposed all speakers to forms of German from outside their own area.\n\n===Science===\nDecisive scientific developments took place during the 16th and 17th centuries, especially in the fields of astronomy, mathematics and physics. The German astronomical community played a dominant role in Europe at this time, as its scientists kept in close touch with one another. Several non-German scientists influenced this community too, like astronomers [[Copernicus]] who worked in [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]] and [[Tycho Brahe]], who worked in [[Kingdom of Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Kingdom of Bohemia (1526-1648)|Bohemia]].

The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648 strengthened it even further, through the acquisition of [[Province of Pomerania (1653\u20131815)|East Pomerania]]. From 1713 to 1740, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|King Frederick William I]], also known as the \"Soldier King\", established a highly centralized, militarized state with a heavily rural population of about three million (compared to the nine million in Austria).\n\nIn terms of the boundaries of 1914, Germany in 1700 had a population of 16 million, increasing slightly to 17 million by 1750, and growing more rapidly to 24 million by 1800. Wars continued, but they were no longer so devastating to the civilian population; famines and major epidemics did not occur, but increased agricultural productivity led to a higher birth rate, and a lower death rate.{{sfn|Sheehan|1989|pp=75, 207\u2013291, 291\u2013323, 324\u2013371, 802\u2013820}}\n\n===Wars===\n[[Louis XIV of France]] conquered parts of [[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace and Lorraine]] (1678\u20131681), and had invaded and devastated the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] (1688\u20131697) in the [[War of the Grand Alliance|War of Palatinian Succession]]. Louis XIV benefited from the Empire's problems with the Turks, which were menacing Austria. Louis XIV ultimately had to relinquish the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]].

But in the [[Silesian Wars]] and in the [[Seven Years' War]] she had to cede 95% of Silesia to Frederick the Great. After the [[Peace of Hubertsburg]] in 1763 between Austria, Prussia and [[Saxony]], Prussia won recognition as a great power, thus launching a century-long rivalry with Austria for the leadership of the German peoples.\n\nFrom 1763, against resistance from the nobility and citizenry, an \"[[enlightened absolutism]]\" was established in Prussia and Austria, according to which the ruler governed according to the best precepts of the philosophers. The economies developed and legal reforms were undertaken, including the abolition of torture and the improvement in the status of Jews. Emancipation of the peasants slowly began. Compulsory education was instituted.\n\nIn 1772\u20131795 Prussia took the lead in the [[partitions of Poland]], with Austria and Russia splitting the rest. Prussia occupied the western territories of the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] that surrounded existing Prussian holdings. Poland again became independent in 1918.<ref>Lucjan R.

[[Electorate of Bavaria|Bavaria]] was especially unfortunate in this regard; it was a rural land with very heavy debts and few growth centers. [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] was in economically good shape, although its government was seriously mismanaged, and numerous wars had taken their toll. During the time when Prussia rose rapidly within Germany, Saxony was distracted by foreign affairs. The house of Wettin concentrated on acquiring and then holding on to the Polish throne which was ultimately unsuccessful. In [[History of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] the duke lavished funds on palaces, mistresses, great celebration, and hunting expeditions. Many of the city-states of Germany were run by bishops, who in reality were from powerful noble families and showed scant interest in religion. None developed a significant reputation for good government.<ref name=holborn-1648>{{cite book | last=Holborn | first=Hajo | title=A History of Modern Germany: 1648\u20131840 | year=1964 | pages=291\u2013302}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Residenzschloss Ludwigsburg.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ludwigsburg Palace]] in W\u00fcrttemberg]]\n\nIn [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], the Landgrave [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel|Frederick II]], ruled 1760\u20131785 as an enlightened despot, and raised money by renting soldiers ([[Hessian (soldiers)|called \"Hessians\"]]) to [[Great Britain]] to help fight the [[American Revolutionary War]].

In the process, Prussia became too heterogeneous, lost its identity, and by the 1930s had become an administrative shell of little importance.\n\n===Nobility===\nIn a heavily agrarian society, land ownership played a central role. Germany's nobles, especially those in the East \u2013 called [[Junker]]s \u2013 dominated not only the localities, but also the Prussian court, and especially the Prussian army. Increasingly after 1815, a centralized Prussian government based in Berlin took over the powers of the nobles, which in terms of control over the peasantry had been almost absolute. To help the nobility avoid indebtedness, Berlin set up a credit institution to provide capital loans in 1809, and extended the loan network to peasants in 1849. When the German Empire was established in 1871, the Junker nobility controlled the army and the Navy, the bureaucracy, and the royal court; they generally set governmental policies.<ref>{{cite book | first=Eda | last=Segarra | title=A Social History of Germany: 1648\u20131914 | year=1977 | pages=37\u201355, 183\u2013202}}</ref>\n\n===Peasants and rural life===\nPeasants continued to center their lives in the village, where they were members of a corporate body, and to help manage the community resources and monitor the community life. In the East, they were serfs who were bound permanently to parcels of land. In most of Germany, farming was handled by tenant farmers who paid rents and obligatory services to the landlord, who was typically a nobleman. Peasant leaders supervised the fields and ditches and grazing rights, maintained public order and morals, and supported a village court which handled minor offenses. Inside the family the patriarch made all the decisions, and tried to arrange advantageous marriages for his children. Much of the villages' communal life centered around church services and holy days. In Prussia, the peasants drew lots to choose conscripts required by the army. The noblemen handled external relationships and politics for the villages under their control, and were not typically involved in daily activities or decisions.<ref name=sagarra>{{cite book | last =Sagarra | first=Eda | title=A Social History of Germany: 1648\u20131914 | year=1977 | pages=140\u2013154, 341\u201345}}</ref><ref>For details on the life of a representative peasant farmer, who migrated in 1710 to Pennsylvania, see Bernd Kratz, \"Jans Stauffer: A Farmer in Germany before his Emigration to Pennsylvania,\" ''Genealogist,'' Fall 2008, Vol. 22 Issue 2, pp 131\u2013169</ref>\n\n[[Image:Adriaen van Ostade - Peasants in a Tavern.jpg|thumb|\"Peasants in a Tavern\" by [[Adriaen van Ostade]] (c. 1635), at the Alte Pinakothek, Munich]]\n\nThe emancipation of the serfs came in 1770\u20131830, beginning with Schleswig in 1780. The peasants were now ex-serfs and could own their land, buy and sell it, and move about freely. The nobles approved for now they could buy land owned by the peasants. The chief reformer was [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Baron vom Stein]] (1757\u20131831), who was influenced by [[The Enlightenment]], especially the free market ideas of [[Adam Smith]].<ref>{{cite book | first=Guy Stanton | last=Ford | title=Stein and the era of reform in Prussia, 1807\u20131815 | year=1922 | pages=199\u2013220 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6INAAAAIAAJ}}</ref> The end of serfdom raised the personal legal status of the peasantry. A bank was set up so that landowners could borrow government money to buy land from peasants (the peasants were not allowed to use it to borrow money to buy land until 1850). The result was that the large landowners obtained larger estates, and many peasants became landless tenants, or moved to the cities or to America. The other German states imitated Prussia after 1815. In sharp contrast to the violence that characterized land reform in the French Revolution, Germany handled it peacefully. In Schleswig the peasants, who had been influenced by the Enlightenment, played an active role; elsewhere they were largely passive. Indeed, for most peasants, customs and traditions continued largely unchanged, including the old habits of deference to the nobles whose legal authority remained quite strong over the villagers. Although the peasants were no longer tied to the same land as serfs had been, the old paternalistic relationship in East Prussia lasted into the 20th century.<ref name=sagarra/>\n\nThe agrarian reforms in northwestern Germany in the era 1770\u20131870 were driven by progressive governments and local elites. They abolished [[feudal obligations]] and divided collectively owned common land into private parcels and thus created a more efficient market-oriented rural economy, which increased productivity and population growth and strengthened the traditional social order because wealthy peasants obtained most of the former common land, while the rural proletariat was left without land; many left for the cities or America. Meanwhile, the division of the common land served as a buffer preserving social peace between nobles and peasants.<ref>{{citation | first=Stefan | last=Brakensiek | title=Agrarian Individualism in North-Western Germany, 1770\u20131870 | newspaper=German History | date=April 1994 | volume=12 | issue=2 | pages=137\u2013179}}</ref> In the east the serfs were emancipated but the [[Junker|Junker class]] maintained its large estates and monopolized political power.<ref>{{citation | first=J.

No longer did the owner's wife take charge of all the females in the different families in the whole house.  In the new system, farm owners became more professionalized and profit-oriented. They managed the fields and the household exterior according to the dictates of technology, science, and economics. Farm wives supervised family care and the household interior, to which strict standards of cleanliness, order, and thrift applied. The result was the spread of formerly urban bourgeois values into rural Germany.<ref>Marion W. Gray and June K.

They had to provide for their own supervision, health, schooling, and old-age. At the same time, because of the demographic transition, there were far fewer children, allowing for much greater attention to each child. Increasingly the middle-class family valued its privacy and its inward direction, shedding too-close links with the world of work.<ref>Nipperdey, ch 2.</ref> Furthermore, the working classes, the middle classes and the upper classes became physically, psychologically and politically more separate.

Herder argued that every folk had its own particular identity, which was expressed in its language and culture. This legitimized the promotion of German language and culture and helped shape the development of German nationalism.

In order to secure a satisfactory marriage, a woman needed to bring a substantial dowry. In the wealthier families, daughters received their dowry from their families, whereas the poorer women needed to work in order to save their wages so as to improve their chances to wed. Under the German laws, women had property rights over their dowries and inheritances, a valuable benefit as high mortality rates resulted in successive marriages. Before 1789, the majority of women lived confined to society\u2019s private sphere, the home.<ref>Ruth-Ellen B.

Within the educated classes, there was the belief that women needed to be sufficiently educated to be intelligent and agreeable interlocutors to their husbands. However, the lower-class women were expected to be economically productive in order to help their husbands make ends meet.<ref>Eda Sagarra, ''A Social History of Germany: 1648 \u2013 1914'' (1977).</ref>\n\n===French Revolution, 1789\u20131815===\n[[File:Rheinbund 1812, political map.png|thumb|250px|The [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a confederation of client states of the First French Empire, existed from 1806 to 1813.]]\n\nGerman reaction to the [[French Revolution]] was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced the overthrow of the king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the [[Execution of Louis XVI|execution of the French king]] and the onset of [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] disillusioned the Bildungsb\u00fcrgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was to have faith in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.<ref>James J. Sheehan, ''German History, 1770\u20131866'' (1993) pp 207\u201388</ref>\n\nEurope was racked by two decades of war revolving around France's efforts to spread its revolutionary ideals, and the opposition of reactionary royalty. War broke out in 1792 as Austria and Prussia invaded France, but were defeated at the [[Battle of Valmy]] (1792). The German lands saw armies marching back and forth, bringing devastation (albeit on a far lower scale than the [[Thirty Years' War]], almost two centuries before), but also bringing new ideas of liberty and civil rights for the people. Prussia and Austria ended their failed wars with France but (with Russia) partitioned Poland among themselves in 1793 and 1795. The French took control of the [[Rhineland]], imposed French-style reforms, abolished feudalism, established constitutions, promoted freedom of religion, emancipated Jews, opened the bureaucracy to ordinary citizens of talent, and forced the nobility to share power with the rising middle class. Napoleon created the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] (1807\u20131813) as a model state.<ref>{{cite book | first=Owen |last=Connelly | title=Napoleon's satellite kingdoms |year=1966 | chapter=6}}</ref> These reforms proved largely permanent and modernized the western parts of Germany. When the French tried to impose the French language, German opposition grew in intensity. A [[Second Coalition]] of Britain, Russia, and Austria then attacked France but failed. Napoleon established direct or indirect control over most of western Europe, including the German states apart from Prussia and Austria. The old Holy Roman Empire was little more than a farce; Napoleon simply abolished it in 1806 while forming new countries under his control. In Germany Napoleon set up the \"[[Confederation of the Rhine]],\" comprising most of the German states except Prussia and Austria.<ref name=raff/>\n\nPrussia tried to remain neutral while imposing tight controls on dissent, but with German nationalism sharply on the rise, the small nation blundered by going to war with Napoleon in 1806. Its economy was weak, its leadership poor, and the once mighty Prussian army was a hollow shell. Napoleon easily crushed it at the [[Battle of Jena]] (1806). Napoleon occupied Berlin, and Prussia paid dearly. Prussia lost its recently acquired territories in western Germany, its army was reduced to 42,000 men, no trade with Britain was allowed, and Berlin had to pay Paris heavy reparations and fund the French army of occupation. Saxony changed sides to support Napoleon and join his Confederation of the Rhine; its elector was rewarded with the title of king and given a slice of Poland taken from Prussia.\n\nAfter [[French invasion of Russia|Napoleon's fiasco in Russia in 1812]], including the deaths of many Germans in his invasion army, Prussia joined with Russia. Major battles followed in quick order, and when Austria switched sides to oppose Napoleon, his situation grew tenuous. He was defeated in a great [[Battle of Leipzig]] in late 1813, and Napoleon's empire started to collapse. One after another the German states switched to oppose Napoleon, but he rejected peace terms. Allied armies invaded France in early 1814, Paris fell, and in April Napoleon surrendered. He returned for 100 days in 1815, but was finally defeated by the British and German armies at [[Battle of Waterloo|Waterloo]]. Prussia was the big winner at the Vienna peace conference, gaining extensive territory.{{sfn|Sheehan|1989|pp=75, 207\u2013291, 291\u2013323, 324\u2013371, 802\u2013820}}\n\n==1815\u20131867==\n===Overview===\n[[File:Deutscher Bund.svg|thumb|250px|The [[German Confederation]] 1815\u20131866.

Politically, the victorious allies set out to build a new balance of powers in order to keep the peace, and decided that a stable German region would be able to keep French imperialism at bay. To make this a possibility, the idea of reforming the defunct [[Holy Roman Empire]] was discarded, and [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s [[German mediatization|reorganization of the German states]] was kept and the remaining princes were allowed to keep their titles. In 1813, in return for guarantees from the Allies that the sovereignty and integrity of the Southern German states ([[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]], and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]) would be preserved, they broke with the French.{{sfn|Carr|1991|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n===German Confederation===\n{{main|German Confederation}}\n\nThe '''German Confederation''' ({{lang-de|Deutscher Bund}}) was the loose association of 39 states created in 1815 to coordinate the economies of separate German-speaking countries. It acted as a buffer between the powerful states of Austria and Prussia. Britain approved of it because London felt that there was need for a stable, peaceful power in central Europe that could discourage aggressive moves by France or Russia. According to Lee (1985), most historians have judged the Confederation to be weak and ineffective, as well as an obstacle to German nationalist aspirations. It collapsed because of the rivalry between Prussia and Austria (known as [[German dualism]]), warfare, the 1848 revolution, and the inability of the multiple members to compromise.{{sfn|Lee|1985|pp=332\u201346}} It was replaced by the [[North German Confederation]] in 1866.\n\n===Society and economy===\n\n====Population====\nThe population of the German Confederation (excluding Austria) grew 60% from 1815 to 1865, from 21,000,000 to 34,000,000.{{sfn|Nipperdey|1996|p=86}} The era saw the [[Demographic Transition]] take place in Germany. It was a transition from high birth rates and high death rates to low birth and death rates as the country developed from a pre-industrial to a modernized agriculture and supported a fast-growing industrialized urban economic system. In previous centuries, the shortage of land meant that not everyone could marry, and marriages took place after age 25. After 1815, increased agricultural productivity meant a larger food supply, and a decline in famines, epidemics, and malnutrition. This allowed couples to marry earlier, and have more children. Arranged marriages became uncommon as young people were now allowed to choose their own marriage partners, subject to a veto by the parents. The high birthrate was offset by a very high rate of infant mortality and emigration, especially after about 1840, mostly to the [[German-Americans|German settlements in the United States]], plus periodic epidemics and harvest failures. The upper and middle classes began to practice birth control, and a little later so too did the peasants.{{sfn|Nipperdey|1996|pp=87\u201392, 99}}\n\n====Industrialization====\nBefore 1850 Germany lagged far behind the leaders in industrial development \u2013 Britain, France, and Belgium. In 1800, Germany's social structure was poorly suited to entrepreneurship or economic development. Domination by France during the era of the French Revolution (1790s to 1815), however, produced important institutional reforms. Reforms included the abolition of feudal restrictions on the sale of large landed estates, the reduction of the power of the guilds in the cities, and the introduction of a new, more efficient commercial law. Nevertheless, traditionalism remained strong in most of Germany. Until mid-century, the guilds, the landed aristocracy, the churches, and the government bureaucracies had so many rules and restrictions that entrepreneurship was held in low esteem, and given little opportunity to develop. From the 1830s and 1840s, Prussia, Saxony, and other states reorganized agriculture. The introduction of sugar beets, turnips, and potatoes yielded a higher level of food production, which enabled a surplus rural population to move to industrial areas. The beginnings of the industrial revolution in Germany came in the textile industry, and was facilitated by eliminating tariff barriers through the Zollverein, starting in 1834.<ref>{{citation | first=Richard | last=Tilly | chapter=Germany: 1815\u20131870 | editor-first=Rondo |editor-last=Cameron | title=Banking in the Early Stages of Industrialization: A Study in Comparative Economic History | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1967 | pages=151\u2013182}}</ref>\n\nBy mid-century, the German states were catching up. By 1900 Germany was a world leader in industrialization, along with Britain and the United States. Historian [[Thomas Nipperdey]] sums it up:\n:{{cquote|On the whole, industrialisation in Germany must be considered to have been positive in its effects. Not only did it change society and the countryside, and finally the world...it created the modern world we live in. It solved the problems of population growth, under-employment and pauperism in a stagnating economy, and abolished dependency on the natural conditions of agriculture, and finally hunger. It created huge improvements in production and both short- and long-term improvements in living standards. However, in terms of social inequality, it can be assumed that it did not change the relative levels of income. Between 1815 and 1873 the statistical distribution of wealth was on the order of 77% to 23% for entrepreneurs and workers respectively. On the other hand, new problems arose, in the form of interrupted growth and new crises, such as urbanisation, 'alienation', new underclasses, proletariat and proletarian misery, new injustices and new masters and, eventually, class warfare.}}<ref>Thomas Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) p 178</ref>\n\n====Urbanization====\nIndustrialization brought rural Germans to the factories, mines and railways. The population in 1800 was heavily rural, with only 10% of the people living in communities of 5000 or more people, and only 2% living in cities of more than 100,000. After 1815, the urban population grew rapidly, due primarily to the influx of young people from the rural areas. Berlin grew from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 in 1870; Hamburg grew from 130,000 to 290,000; Munich from 40,000 to 269,000; and Dresden from 60,000 to 177,000. Offsetting this growth, there was extensive emigration, especially to the United States. Emigration totaled 480,000 in the 1840s, 1,200,000 in the 1850s, and 780,000 in the 1860s.<ref>Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n\n====Railways====\n{{Main|History of rail transport in Germany}}\n[[File:Friedrich List und die erste grosse Eisenbahn 2.jpg|thumb|[[Friedrich List]]'s concept for a German railway net from 1833]]\nThe takeoff stage of economic development came with the railroad revolution in the 1840s, which opened up new markets for local products, created a pool of middle managers, increased the demand for engineers, architects and skilled machinists and stimulated investments in coal and iron. Political disunity of three dozen states and a pervasive conservatism made it difficult to build railways in the 1830s. However, by the 1840s, trunk lines did link the major cities; each German state was responsible for the lines within its own borders. Economist [[Friedrich List]] summed up the advantages to be derived from the development of the railway system in 1841:\n:{{cquote|\n# As a means of national defence, it facilitates the concentration, distribution and direction of the army.\n# It is a means to the improvement of the culture of the nation. It brings talent, knowledge and skill of every kind readily to market.\n# It secures the community against dearth and famine, and against excessive fluctuation in the prices of the necessaries of life.\n# It promotes the spirit of the nation, as it has a tendency to destroy the Philistine spirit arising from isolation and provincial prejudice and vanity. It binds nations by ligaments, and promotes an interchange of food and of commodities, thus making it feel to be a unit. The iron rails become a nerve system, which, on the one hand, strengthens public opinion, and, on the other hand, strengthens the power of the state for police and governmental purposes.}}<ref>Nipperdey, ''Germany from Napoleon to Bismarck: 1800\u20131866'' (1996) p.&nbsp;165</ref>\n\nLacking a technological base at first, the Germans imported their engineering and hardware from Britain, but quickly learned the skills needed to operate and expand the railways. In many cities, the new railway shops were the centres of technological awareness and training, so that by 1850, Germany was self-sufficient in meeting the demands of railroad construction, and the railways were a major impetus for the growth of the new steel industry. Observers found that even as late as 1890, their engineering was inferior to Britain\u2019s. However, German unification in 1870 stimulated consolidation, nationalisation into state-owned companies, and further rapid growth. Unlike the situation in France, the goal was support of industrialisation, and so, heavy lines crisscrossed the Ruhr and other industrial districts, and provided good connections to the major ports of Hamburg and Bremen. By 1880, Germany had 9,400 locomotives pulling 43,000 passengers and 30,000 tons of freight a day, and forged ahead of France.<ref>{{cite book | first=Allan |last=Mitchell | title=Great Train Race: Railways and the Franco-German Rivalry, 1815\u20131914 | year=2000}}</ref>\n\n====Newspapers and magazines====\n{{main|History of German journalism|History of newspapers and magazines#Germany}}\nA large number of newspapers and magazines flourished; A typical small city had one or two newspapers; Berlin and Leipzig had dozens. The audience was limited to perhaps five percent of the adult men, chiefly from the aristocratic and middle classes, who followed politics. Liberal papers outnumbered conservative ones by a wide margin. Foreign governments bribed editors to guarantee a favorable image.<ref>Theodore S. Hamerow, ''The Social Foundations of German Unification, 1858\u20131871: Ideas and Institutions'' (1969) pp 284\u201391</ref> Censorship was strict, and the government issued the political news they were supposed to report. After 1871, strict press laws were used by Bismarck to shut down the Socialist, and to threaten hostile editors. There were no national newspapers. Editors focused on political commentary, but also included in a nonpolitical cultural page, focused on the arts and high culture. Especially popular was the serialized novel, with a new chapter every week. Magazines were politically more influential, and attracted the leading intellectuals as authors.<ref>Kenneth E. Olson, ''The history makers: The press of Europe from its beginnings through 1965'' (LSU Press, 1966) pp 99\u2013134</ref>\n\n====Science and culture====\nGerman artists and intellectuals, heavily influenced by the French Revolution and by the great German poet and writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749\u20131832), turned to [[Romanticism]] after a period of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Philosophical thought was decisively shaped by [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724\u20131804). [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] (1770\u20131827) was the leading composer of [[Romantic music]]. His use of tonal architecture in such a way as to allow significant expansion of musical forms and structures was immediately recognized as bringing a new dimension to music. His later piano music and string quartets, especially, showed the way to a completely unexplored musical universe, and influenced [[Franz Schubert]] (1797\u20131828) and [[Robert Schumann]] (1810\u20131856). In opera, a new Romantic atmosphere combining supernatural terror and melodramatic plot in a folkloric context was first successfully achieved by [[Carl Maria von Weber]] (1786\u20131826) and perfected by [[Richard Wagner]] (1813\u20131883) in his [[Ring Cycle]]. The [[Brothers Grimm]] (1785\u20131863 & 1786\u20131859) not only collected folk stories into the popular [[Grimm's Fairy Tales]], but were also linguists, now counted among the founding fathers of [[German studies]]. They were commissioned to begin the [[Deutsches W\u00f6rterbuch]] (\"The German Dictionary\"), which remains the most comprehensive work on the German language.<ref>Elmer H. Antonsen, James W. Marchand, and Ladislav Zgusta, eds. ''The Grimm brothers and the Germanic past'' (John Benjamins Publishing, 1990).</ref>\n\nAt the universities high-powered professors developed international reputations, especially in the humanities led by history and philology, which brought a new historical perspective to the study of political history, theology, philosophy, language, and literature. With [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770\u20131831) in philosophy, [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]] (1768\u20131834) in theology and [[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) in history, the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]], founded in 1810, became the world's leading university. Von Ranke, for example, professionalized history and set the world standard for historiography. By the 1830s mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology had emerged with world class science, led by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] (1769\u20131859) in natural science and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] (1777\u20131855) in mathematics.

Across the land, there was a movement to unite the larger Lutheran and the smaller Reformed Protestant churches. The churches themselves brought this about in Baden, Nassau, and Bavaria. However, in Prussia King [[Frederick William III]] was determined to handle unification entirely on his own terms, without consultation. His goal was to unify the Protestant churches, and to impose a single standardized liturgy, organization and even architecture. The long-term goal was to have fully centralized royal control of all the Protestant churches. In a series of proclamations over several decades the [[Prussian Union of churches|''Church of the Prussian Union'']] was formed, bringing together the more numerous Lutherans, and the less numerous Reformed Protestants. The government of Prussia now had full control over church affairs, with the king himself recognized as the leading bishop. Opposition to unification came from the \"Old Lutherans\" in Silesia who clung tightly to the theological and liturgical forms they had followed since the days of Luther. The government attempted to crack down on them, so they went underground. Tens of thousands migrated, [[German Australian|to South Australia]], and especially to the United States, where they formed the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod|Missouri Synod]], which is still in operation as a conservative denomination. Finally in 1845 a new king [[Frederick William IV]] offered a general amnesty and allowed the Old Lutherans to form a separate church association with only nominal government control.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' (2006) pp 412\u201319</ref><ref>Christopher Clark, \"Confessional policy and the limits of state action: Frederick William III and the Prussian Church Union 1817\u201340.\" ''Historical Journal'' 39.04 (1996) pp: 985\u20131004.

The rationalism of the late 19th century faded away, and there was a new emphasis on the psychology and feeling of the individual, especially in terms of contemplating sinfulness, redemption, and the mysteries and the revelations of Christianity. [[Pietism|Pietistic revivals]] were common among Protestants. Among Catholics there was a sharp increase in popular pilgrimages. In 1844 alone, half a million pilgrims made a pilgrimage to the city of Trier in the Rhineland to view the [[Seamless robe of Jesus]], said to be the robe that Jesus wore on the way to his crucifixion. Catholic bishops in Germany had historically been largely independent Of Rome, but now the Vatican exerted increasing control, a new \"[[ultramontanism]]\" of Catholics highly loyal to Rome.<ref>Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' (2006) pp 419\u201321</ref> A sharp controversy broke out in 1837\u201338 in the largely Catholic Rhineland over the religious education of children of mixed marriages, where the mother was Catholic and the father Protestant. The government passed laws to require that these children always be raised as Protestants, contrary to Napoleonic law that had previously prevailed and allowed the parents to make the decision. It put the Catholic Archbishop under house arrest. In 1840, the new King Frederick William IV sought reconciliation and ended the controversy by agreeing to most of the Catholic demands. However Catholic memories remained deep and led to a sense that Catholics always needed to stick together in the face of an untrustworthy government.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany 1648\u20131840'' (1964) pp 498\u2013509</ref>\n\n===Politics of restoration and revolution===\n{{Main|German Confederation}}\n\n====After Napoleon====\n[[File:Hambacher Fest 1832.jpg|thumb|At the [[Hambach Festival]] in 1832, intellectuals with various political backgrounds were among the first to use the future [[Flag of Germany]] and called for a [[German question|unified German nation]].]]\nAfter the fall of Napoleon, Europe's statesmen convened in Vienna in 1815 for the reorganisation of European affairs, under the leadership of the [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Austrian Prince Metternich]].

In May the German National Assembly (the [[Frankfurt Parliament]]) met in Frankfurt to draw up a national German constitution.\n\nBut the 1848 revolution turned out to be unsuccessful: [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|King Frederick William IV of Prussia]] refused the imperial crown, the Frankfurt parliament was dissolved, the ruling princes repressed the risings by military force, and the German Confederation was re-established by 1850. Many leaders went into exile, including a number who went to the United States and became a political force there.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wittke|first1=C.

Dissent was vigorously suppressed, and many Germans emigrated to America following the collapse of the 1848 uprisings. Frederick William IV became extremely depressed and melancholy during this period, and was surrounded by men who advocated [[clericalism]] and [[Divine right of kings|absolute divine monarchy]]. The Prussian people once again lost interest in politics. Prussia not only expanded its territory but began to industrialize rapidly, while maintaining a strong agricultural base.\n\n====Bismarck takes charge, 1862\u20131866====\n[[Image:BismarckRoonMoltke.jpg|thumb|left|[[Otto von Bismarck]], [[Albrecht Graf von Roon]], [[Helmut von Moltke]], the three leaders of Prussia in the 1860s]]\nIn 1857, the king had a stroke and his brother [[William I, German Emperor|William]] became regent, then became King William I in 1861. Although conservative, William I was far more pragmatic. His most significant accomplishment was naming [[Otto von Bismarck]] as chancellor in 1862. The combination of Bismarck, Defense Minister [[Albrecht von Roon]], and Field Marshal [[Helmut von Moltke]] set the stage for victories over Denmark, Austria, and France, and led to the unification of Germany. The obstacle to German unification was Austria, and Bismarck solved the problem with a series of wars that united the German states north of Austria.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945'' pp 131\u201367</ref><ref>Edgar Feuchtwanger, ''Bismarck: A Political History'' (2nd ed., Routledge, 2014) pp 83\u201398</ref>\n\nIn 1863\u201364, disputes between Prussia and Denmark grew over [[Schleswig]], which was not part of the German Confederation, and which Danish nationalists wanted to incorporate into the Danish kingdom. The dispute led to the short [[Second War of Schleswig]] in 1864. Prussia, joined by Austria, easily defeated Denmark and occupied [[Jutland]]. The Danes were forced to cede both the duchy of Schleswig and the duchy of Holstein to Austria and Prussia. In the aftermath, the management of the two duchies caused escalating tensions between Austria and Prussia. The former wanted the duchies to become an independent entity within the German Confederation, while the latter wanted to annex them. The [[Seven Weeks War]] between Austria and Prussia broke out in June 1866. In July, the two armies clashed at Sadowa-K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz (Bohemia) in an [[Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz|enormous battle]] involving half a million men. The Prussian breech-loading [[needle gun]]s carried the day over the slow [[muzzle-loading rifle]]s of the Austrians, who lost a quarter of their army in the battle. Austria ceded [[Venice]] to Italy, but Bismarck was deliberately lenient with the loser to keep alive a long-term alliance with Austria in a subordinate role. Now the French faced an increasingly strong Prussia.<ref>Holborn, ''A History of Modern Germany: 1840\u20131945'' pp 167\u201388</ref><ref>Feuchtwanger, ''Bismarck: A Political History'' (2014) pp 99\u2013147</ref>\n\n====North German Federation, 1866\u20131871====\n[[File:Flag of the German Empire.svg|thumb| Flag of the [[North German Confederation]] (1866\u201371) and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918).]]\n{{Main|North German Confederation}}\nIn 1866, the German Confederation was dissolved. In its place the [[North German Federation]] (German ''Norddeutscher Bund'') was established, under the leadership of Prussia. Austria was excluded, and the Austrian influence in Germany that had begun in the 15th century finally came to an end. The North German Federation was a transitional organisation that existed from 1867 to 1871, between the dissolution of the German Confederation and the founding of the German Empire.<ref>Gordon A.

Bismarck tried to foster alliances in Europe, on one hand to contain France, and on the other hand to consolidate Germany's influence in Europe. On the domestic front Bismarck tried to stem the rise of socialism by anti-socialist laws, combined with an introduction of health care and social security. At the same time Bismarck tried to reduce the political influence of the emancipated Catholic minority in the [[Kulturkampf]], literally \"culture struggle\". The Catholics only grew stronger, forming the Center (Zentrum) Party. Germany grew rapidly in industrial and economic power, matching Britain by 1900. Its highly professional army was the best in the world, but the navy could never catch up with Britain's Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1888, the young and ambitious Kaiser [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] became emperor. He could not abide advice, least of all from the most experienced politician and diplomat in Europe, so he fired Bismarck. The Kaiser opposed Bismarck's careful foreign policy and wanted Germany to pursue colonialist policies, as Britain and France had been doing for decades, as well as build a navy that could match the British. The Kaiser promoted active colonization of Africa and Asia for those areas that were not already colonies of other European powers; his record was notoriously brutal and set the stage for genocide. The Kaiser took a mostly unilateral approach in Europe with as main ally the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and an arms race with Britain, which eventually led to the situation in which the assassination of the Austrian-Hungarian crown prince could spark off [[World War I]].\n\n===Age of Bismarck===\n[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|On 18 January 1871, the German Empire is proclaimed in the Hall of Mirrors of the Palace of Versailles. Bismarck appears in white.]]\n\n====The new empire====\nDisputes between France and Prussia increased. In 1868, the Spanish queen [[Isabella II]] was expelled by a revolution, leaving that country's throne vacant. When Prussia tried to put a Hohenzollern candidate, Prince Leopold, on the Spanish throne, the French angrily protested. In July 1870, France declared war on Prussia (the [[Franco-Prussian War]]). The debacle was swift. A succession of German victories in northeastern France followed, and one French army was besieged at Metz. After a few weeks, the main army was finally forced to capitulate in the [[Battle of Sedan|fortress of Sedan]]. French Emperor Napoleon III was taken prisoner and a [[Government of National Defence|republic]] hastily proclaimed in Paris. The new government, realising that a victorious Germany would demand territorial acquisitions, resolved to fight on. They began to muster new armies, and the Germans settled down to a grim siege of Paris. The starving city surrendered in January 1871, and the Prussian army staged a victory parade in it. France was forced to pay indemnities of 5&nbsp;billion francs and cede Alsace-Lorraine. It was a bitter peace that would leave the French thirsting for revenge.\n\nDuring the [[Siege of Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]], the German princes assembled in the Hall of Mirrors of the [[Palace of Versailles]] and proclaimed the Prussian King [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] as the \"German Emperor\" on 18 January 1871. The German Empire was thus founded, with the [[Unification of Germany|German states unified]] into a single economic, political, and administrative unit. The empire comprised 25 states, three of which were Hanseatic free cities. It was dubbed the \"Little German\" solution, since it excluded the Austrian territories and the [[House of Lorraine|Habsburgs]]. Bismarck, again, was appointed to serve as Chancellor.\n\nThe new empire was characterised by a great enthusiasm and vigor. There was a rash of heroic artwork in imitation of Greek and Roman styles, and the nation possessed a vigorous, growing industrial economy, while it had always been rather poor in the past.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The change from the slower, more tranquil order of the old Germany was very sudden, and many, especially the nobility, resented being displaced by the new rich. And yet, the nobles clung stubbornly to power, and they, not the bourgeois, continued to be the model that everyone wanted to imitate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} In imperial Germany, possessing a collection of medals or wearing a uniform was valued more than the size of one's bank account, and Berlin never became a great cultural center as London, Paris, or Vienna were.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} The empire was distinctly authoritarian in tone, as the 1871 constitution gave the emperor exclusive power to appoint or dismiss the chancellor. He also was supreme commander-in-chief of the armed forces and final arbiter of foreign policy. But freedom of speech, association, and religion were nonetheless guaranteed by the constitution.\n\nBismarck's domestic policies as Chancellor of Germany were characterised by his fight against perceived enemies of the Protestant Prussian state. In the [[Kulturkampf]] (1871\u20131878), he tried to minimize the influence of the Roman Catholic Church and of its political arm, the [[Catholic Centre Party]], through various measures\u2014like the introduction of civil marriage\u2014but without much success. The Kulturkampf antagonised many Protestants as well as Catholics, and was eventually abandoned. Millions of non-Germans subjects in the German Empire, like the Polish, Danish and French minorities, were discriminated against,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=772 | title = A German Voice of Opposition to Germanization (1914) | work = German History in Documents and Images | publisher = German Historical Institute (www.ghi-dc.org)}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_document.cfm?document_id=771 | title =Germanization Policy: Speech by Ludwik Jazdzewski in a Session of the Prussian House of Representatives (January 15, 1901) | work = German History in Documents and Images | publisher = German Historical Institute (www.ghi-dc.org)}}</ref> and a policy of [[Germanisation]] was implemented.\n\n====Classes====\n{{see also|Feminism in Germany#Wilhelmine Germany}}\n\n=====Aristocracy=====\nThe new Empire provided rich new opportunities at the top for the nobility of Prussia, and the other states, to fill. They dominated the diplomatic service, the Army, and the civil service. Through their control of the civil service, the aristocracy had a dominant voice in decisions affecting the universities and the churches. In 1914, Germany's diplomats consisted of eight princes 29 counts 20 barons 54 other nobles, and a mere 11 commoners. The commoners were chiefly the sons of leading industrialists or bankers. Almost all the diplomats had been socialized into the feudal student corps at the universities. The consular corps comprised commoners, but they had little decision-making ability.<ref>John C.G.

Berlin's rapidly increasing rich middle-class aped and copied the aristocracy and tried to marry into it. The closed system stood in contrast to Britain where the top levels of the elite were far more open with routes available through a public school education, Oxford, and Cambridge, the Inns of Court, appointment to high office, or leadership in the House of Commons.

The [[Bund Deutscher Frauenvereine]] (Association of German Women's Organizations or BDF) was established in 1894 to encompass the proliferating women's organizations that had sprung up since the 1860s. From the beginning the BDF was a bourgeois organization, its members working toward equality with men in such areas as education, financial opportunities, and political life. Working-class women were not welcome; they were organized by the Socialists.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite book|first=Patricia M. |last=Maz\u00f3n|title=Gender and the Modern Research University: The Admission of Women to German Higher Education, 1865\u20131914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_SKPLZtwulQC&pg=PA53|year=2003|publisher=Stanford U.P.|page=53}}</ref>\n\n=====Working class=====\nThe rise of the Socialist Workers' Party (later known as the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]], SPD), declared its aim to establish peacefully a new socialist order through the transformation of existing political and social conditions.

He launched a [[Kulturkampf]] (\"culture war\") against the power of the pope and the Catholic Church in 1873, but only in Prussia. This gained strong support from German liberals, who saw the Catholic Church as the bastion of reaction and their greatest enemy.

It stated that [[republicanism]] and [[socialism]] were common enemies and that the three powers would discuss any matters concerning foreign policy. Bismarck needed good relations with Russia in order to keep France isolated. In 1877\u20131878, Russia fought a victorious [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|war with the Ottoman Empire]] and attempted to impose the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] on it. This upset the British in particular, as they were long concerned with preserving the [[Ottoman Empire]] and preventing a Russian takeover of the [[Bosphorus Strait]]. Germany hosted the [[Congress of Berlin]] (1878), whereby a more moderate peace settlement was agreed to. Germany had no direct interest in the Balkans, however, which was largely an Austrian and Russian sphere of influence, although King Carol of Romania was a German prince.\n\nIn 1879, Bismarck formed a Dual Alliance of Germany and Austria-Hungary, with the aim of mutual military assistance in the case of an attack from Russia, which was not satisfied with the agreement reached at the Congress of Berlin. The establishment of the Dual Alliance led Russia to take a more conciliatory stance, and in 1887, the so-called [[Reinsurance Treaty]] was signed between Germany and Russia: in it, the two powers agreed on mutual military support in the case that France attacked Germany, or in case of an Austrian attack on Russia. Russia turned its attention eastward to Asia and remained largely inactive in European politics for the next 25 years. In 1882, Italy joined the Dual Alliance to form a [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. Italy wanted to defend its interests in [[North Africa]] against France's colonial policy. In return for German and Austrian support, Italy committed itself to assisting Germany in the case of a French military attack.<ref>{{Citation | first=Patricia A. | last=Weitsman | title=Dangerous alliances: proponents of peace, weapons of war | year=2004 | page=79}}</ref>\n\nFor a long time, Bismarck had refused to give in to widespread public demands to give Germany \"a place in the sun\" through the acquisition of overseas colonies. In 1880 Bismarck gave way, and a number of colonies were established overseas. In Africa, these were [[Togo]], the [[Kamerun|Cameroons]], [[German South-West Africa]], and [[German East Africa]]; in [[Oceania]], they were [[German New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], and the [[Marshall Islands]]. In fact, it was Bismarck himself who helped initiate the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885. He did it to \"establish international guidelines for the acquisition of African territory\" (see [[Colonisation of Africa]]). This conference was an impetus for the \"Scramble for Africa\" and \"[[New Imperialism]]\".<ref>{{cite book | first=Kirsten |last=Belgum | title=Popularizing the Nation: Audience, Representation, and the Production of Identity in \"Die Gartenlaube,\" 1853\u20131900 | year=1998 |page=149}}</ref>\n\n===Wilhelminian Era===\n\n====Wilhelm II.====\n[[File:1890 Bismarcks Ruecktritt.jpg|thumb|upright|\"[[Dropping the Pilot]]\" \u2013 British editorial cartoon depicting Bismarck's dismissal by Wilhelm II in 1890]]\nIn 1888, emperor William I died at the age of 90.

Germany refused to renew its treaties with Russia. But Russia did form a closer relationship with France in the [[Franco-Russian Alliance|Dual Alliance of 1894]], since both were worried about the possibilities of German aggression. Furthermore, Anglo\u2013German relations cooled as Germany aggressively tried to build a new empire and engaged in a [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval race]] with Britain; London refused to agree to the formal alliance that Germany sought. Berlin's analysis proved mistaken on every point, leading to Germany's increasing isolation and its dependence on the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], which brought together Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy. The Triple Alliance was undermined by differences between Austria and Italy, and in 1915 Italy switched sides.<ref name=raff>{{citation | first=Diethher |last=Raff | title=History of Germany from the Medieval Empire to the Present | year=1988 | pages=34\u201355, 202\u2013206}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the German Navy under Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] had ambitions to rival the great British Navy, and dramatically expanded its fleet in the early 20th century to protect the colonies and exert power worldwide.<ref>{{cite journal | first=David |last=Woodward | title=Admiral Tirpitz, Secretary of State for the Navy, 1897\u20131916 | journal=History Today | date=July 1963 | volume=13 |issue=8 | pages=548\u2013555}}</ref> Tirpitz started a programme of warship construction in 1898.

This posed a direct threat to British hegemony on the seas, with the result that negotiations for an alliance between Germany and Britain broke down. The British, however, kept well ahead in the [[Anglo-German naval arms race|naval race]] by the introduction of the highly advanced new ''[[Dreadnought]]'' battleship in 1907.<ref>{{cite book | first=Holger | last=Herwig | title=Luxury Fleet: The Imperial German Navy 1888\u20131918 | year=1980}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] of 1905, Germany nearly came to blows with Britain and France when the latter attempted to establish a protectorate over Morocco. The Germans were upset at having not been informed about French intentions, and declared their support for Moroccan independence. William II made a highly provocative speech regarding this. The following year, a conference was held in which all of the European powers except Austria-Hungary (by now little more than a German satellite) sided with France. A compromise was brokered by the United States where the French relinquished some, but not all, control over Morocco.<ref>{{cite book | first=Raymond A. |last=Esthus | title=Theodore Roosevelt and the International Rivalries | year=1970 | pages=66\u2013111}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Agadir Crisis|Second Moroccan Crisis]] of 1911 saw another dispute over Morocco erupt when France tried to suppress a revolt there. Germany, still smarting from the previous quarrel, agreed to a settlement whereby the French ceded some territory in central Africa in exchange for Germany's renouncing any right to intervene in Moroccan affairs. This confirmed French control over Morocco, which became a full protectorate of that country in 1912.\n\n====Economy====\n[[File:BASF Werk Ludwigshafen 1881.JPG|thumb|The [[BASF]]-chemical factories in [[Ludwigshafen]], 1881]]\nThe economy continued to industrialize and urbanize, with heavy industry \u2013 especially coal and steel \u2013 becoming important in the Ruhr, and manufacturing growing in the cities, the Ruhr, and Silesia. Perkins (1981) argues that more important than Bismarck's new tariff on imported grain was the introduction of the sugar beet as a main crop. Farmers quickly abandoned traditional, inefficient practices in favor of modern methods, including use of new fertilizers and new tools. The knowledge and tools gained from the intensive farming of sugar and other root crops made Germany the most efficient agricultural producer in Europe by 1914. Even so, farms were small in size, and women did much of the field work. An unintended consequence was the increased dependence on migratory, especially foreign, labor.<ref>{{cite journal | first=J.A. | last=Perkins | title=The Agricultural Revolution in Germany 1850\u20131914 | journal = Journal of European Economic History | date=Spring 1981 | volume=10 | issue=1 |pages=71\u2013119}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Paul Hoeniger Spittelmarkt 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Berlin in 1912]]\nBased on its leadership in chemical research in the universities and industrial laboratories, Germany became dominant in the world's chemical industry in the late 19th century.

Awaiting a short war, a message on the car spells out \"Trip to Paris\".]]\n\n====Causes====\nEthnic demands for nation states upset the balance between the empires that dominated Europe, [[causes of World War I|leading to World War I]], which started in August 1914. Germany stood behind its ally Austria in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and later Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France, Britain, and in 1915 Italy.\n\nIn explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, Kennedy (1980) recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, high-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure-groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a necessary military tactic or a profound moral crime. The German invasion of Belgium was not important because the British decision had already been made and the British were more concerned with the fate of France (pp.&nbsp;457\u201362). Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 \u2014 when Prussia and the German states smashed France \u2014 would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policy makers insisted that would be a catastrophe for British security.<ref>{{cite book | first=Paul M. |last=Kennedy | title=The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860\u20131914 | year=1980 | pages=464\u2013470}}</ref>\n\n====Western Front====\nIn the west, Germany sought a quick victory by encircling Paris using the [[Schlieffen Plan]]. But it failed due to Belgian resistance, Berlin's diversion of troops, and very stiff French resistance on the [[Marne]], north of Paris.\n\nThe [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] became an extremely bloody battleground of [[trench warfare]]. The stalemate lasted from 1914 until early 1918, with ferocious battles that moved forces a few hundred yards at best along a line that stretched from the [[North Sea]] to the Swiss border. The British imposed a tight naval blockade in the [[North Sea]] which lasted until 1919, sharply reducing Germany's overseas access to raw materials and foodstuffs. Food scarcity became a serious problem by 1917.<ref>{{cite book | first=J.M. |last=Winter | title=Capital Cities at War: Paris, London, Berlin, 1914\u20131919 | year=1999}}</ref>\n\nThe United States joined with the Allies in April 1917. The entry of the United States into the war \u2013 following Germany's declaration of unrestricted submarine warfare \u2013 marked a decisive turning-point against Germany.<ref>{{cite book | first=Hew | last=Strachan | title=The First World War | year=2004}}</ref>\n\n====Eastern Front====\nMore wide open was the fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. In the east, there were decisive victories against the Russian army, the trapping and defeat of large parts of the Russian contingent at the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], followed by huge Austrian and German successes. The breakdown of Russian forces \u2013 exacerbated by internal turmoil caused by the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]] \u2013 led to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] the Bolsheviks were forced to sign on 3 March 1918 as Russia withdrew from the war. It gave Germany control of Eastern Europe.

Causes involved the transfer of many farmers and food workers into the military, an overburdened railroad system, shortages of coal, and the British blockade that cut off imports from abroad. The winter of 1916\u20131917 was known as the \"turnip winter,\" because that vegetable, usually fed to livestock, was used by people as a substitute for potatoes and meat, which were increasingly scarce. Thousands of soup kitchens were opened to feed the hungry people, who grumbled that the farmers were keeping the food for themselves. Even the army had to cut the rations for soldiers.<ref>{{cite book | first=Roger | last=Chickering | title=Imperial Germany and the Great War, 1914\u20131918 | year=2004 | pages=141\u201342}}</ref> Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink.\n\n1918 was also the year of the deadly [[1918 flu pandemic|1918 Spanish Flu pandemic]] which struck hard at a population weakened by years of malnutrition.\n\n===Revolution 1918===\n{{main|German Revolution of 1918-19|Treaty of Versailles}}\n\nThe end of October 1918, in [[Wilhelmshaven]], in northern Germany, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918\u201319]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost, initiating the uprising. On 3 November, the revolt spread to other cities and states of the country, in many of which workers' and soldiers' councils were established. Meanwhile, Hindenburg and the senior commanders had lost confidence in the Kaiser and his government. The Kaiser and all German ruling princes abdicated. On 9 November 1918, the Social Democrat [[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaimed a Republic.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 175-01448, Berlin, Reichskanzlei, Philipp Scheidemann.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Philipp Scheidemann]] proclaims a [[Weimar Republic|German Republic]] on 9 November 1918.]]\nOn 11 November, [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|the Compi\u00e8gne armistice]] was signed, ending the war. The [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed on 28 June 1919. Germany was to cede Alsace-Lorraine to France. Eupen-Malm\u00e9dy would temporarily be ceded to Belgium, with a plebiscite to be held to allow the people the choice of the territory either remaining with Belgium or being returned to German control. Following a plebiscite, the territory was allotted to Belgium on 20 September 1920. The future of [[Northern Schleswig|North Schleswig]] was to be decided by plebiscite. In the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]], the Danish-speaking population in the north voted for Denmark and the southern, German speaking populace, part voted for Germany. Schleswig was thus partitioned. Holstein remained German without a referendum. [[Klaip\u0117da|Memel]] was ceded to the Allied and Associated powers, to decide the future of the area. On 9 January 1923, Lithuanian forces invaded the territory. Following negotiations, on 8 May 1924, the League of Nations ratified the annexation on the grounds that Lithuania accepted the [[Memel Statute]], a power-sharing arrangement to protect non-Lithuanians in the territory and its autonomous status. Until 1929, German-Lithuanian co-operation increased and this power sharing arrangement worked. Poland was restored and most of the provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia]], and some areas of [[Upper Silesia]] were reincorporated into the reformed country after plebiscites and independence uprisings. All German colonies were to be handed over to League of Nations, who then assigned them as [[League of Nations mandate|Mandates]] to Australia, France, Japan, New Zealand, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. The new owners were required to act as a disinterested trustee over the region, promoting the welfare of its inhabitants in a variety of ways until they were able to govern themselves. The left and right banks of the Rhine were to be permanently demilitarised. The industrially important [[Saarland]] was to be governed by the [[League of Nations]] for 15 years and its coalfields administered by France. At the end of that time a plebiscite was to determine the Saar's future status. To ensure execution of the treaty's terms, Allied troops would occupy the left (German) bank of the Rhine for a period of 5\u201315 years. The German army was to be limited to 100,000 officers and men; the general staff was to be dissolved; vast quantities of war material were to be handed over and the manufacture of munitions rigidly curtailed. The navy was to be similarly reduced, and no military aircraft were allowed. Germany was also required to pay [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for all civilian damage caused during the war.\n\n==Weimar Republic, 1919\u20131933==\n{{Main|Weimar Republic}}\n\n===Overview===\n[[File:Karte des Deutschen Reiches, Weimarer Republik-Drittes Reich 1919\u20131937.svg|250px|thumb|right|Germany 1919\u20131938]]\n\nThe humiliating peace terms in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] provoked bitter indignation throughout Germany, and seriously weakened the new democratic regime. The greatest enemies of democracy had already been constituted. In December 1918, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) was founded, and in 1919 it tried and failed to overthrow the new republic. [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1919 took control of the new [[National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), which failed in a [[Beer Hall Putsch|coup in Munich in 1923]]. Both parties, as well as parties supporting the republic, built militant auxiliaries that engaged in increasingly violent street battles. Electoral support for both parties increased after 1929 as the Great Depression hit the economy hard, producing many unemployed men who became available for the paramilitary units. The Nazis (formerly the German Workers' Party), with a mostly rural and lower middle class base, overthrew the Weimar regime and ruled Germany in 1933\u20131945; the KPD, with a mostly urban and working class base, came to power (in the East) in 1945\u20131989.<ref>For a comparison see Timothy S.

It was headed by [[Rosa Luxemburg]] and [[Karl Liebknecht]], and rejected the parliamentary system. In 1920, about 300,000 members from the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] joined the party, transforming it into a mass organization. The Communist Party had a following of about 10% of the electorate.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Deutscher Bundestag|title=The political parties in the Weimar Republic|url=http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/artandhistory/history/factsheets/parties_weimar_republic.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2011|date=March 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125164124/http://www.bundestag.de/htdocs_e/artandhistory/history/factsheets/parties_weimar_republic.pdf|archive-date=25 November 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Flag of Germany (3-2 aspect ratio).svg|thumb|Flag of the Weimar Republic, 1919\u20131933]]\n\nIn the first months of 1920, the [[Reichswehr]] was to be reduced to 100,000 men, in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. This included the dissolution of many [[Freikorps]] \u2013 units made up of volunteers. In an attempt at a coup d'\u00e9tat in March 1920, the [[Kapp Putsch]], extreme right-wing politician Wolfgang Kapp let Freikorps soldiers march on Berlin and proclaimed himself Chancellor of the Reich. After four days the coup d'\u00e9tat collapsed, due to popular opposition and lack of support by the civil servants and the officers. Other cities were shaken by strikes and rebellions, which were bloodily suppressed.\n\nGermany was the first state to establish diplomatic relations with the new [[Soviet Union]]. Under the [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1922|Treaty of Rapallo]], Germany accorded the Soviet Union ''de jure'' recognition, and the two signatories mutually cancelled all pre-war debts and renounced war claims.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1989-040-27, Gustav Stresemann.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Gustav Stresemann]], German Chancellor in 1923 and [[List of Nobel Peace Prize laureates|Nobel Peace Prize laureate]] in 1926]]\n\nWhen Germany defaulted on its reparation payments, French and Belgian troops occupied the heavily industrialised Ruhr district (January 1923). The German government encouraged the population of the Ruhr to [[passive resistance]]: shops would not sell goods to the foreign soldiers, coal-miners would not dig for the foreign troops, trams in which members of the occupation army had taken seat would be left abandoned in the middle of the street. The passive resistance proved effective, insofar as the occupation became a loss-making deal for the French government. But the Ruhr fight also led to [[hyperinflation]], and many who lost all their fortune would become bitter enemies of the Weimar Republic, and voters of the anti-democratic right. See [[1920s German inflation]].\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-C06886, Paul v. Hindenburg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Paul von Hindenburg]], German President in 1925\u20131934]]\n\nIn September 1923, the deteriorating economic conditions led Chancellor [[Gustav Stresemann]] to call an end to the passive resistance in the Ruhr. In November, his government introduced a new currency, the [[German rentenmark|Rentenmark]] (later: [[German reichsmark|Reichsmark]]), together with other measures to stop the hyperinflation. In the following six years the economic situation improved. In 1928, Germany's industrial production even regained the pre-war levels of 1913.\n\nThe national elections of 1924 led to a swing to the right. Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg]] was [[German presidential election, 1925|elected]] President in 1925.\n\nIn October 1925 the [[Treaty of Locarno]] was signed by Germany, France, Belgium, Britain and Italy; it recognised Germany's borders with France and Belgium. Moreover, Britain, Italy and Belgium undertook to assist France in the case that German troops marched into the demilitarised Rheinland. Locarno paved the way for Germany's admission to the [[League of Nations]] in 1926.\n\n===Reparations===\nThe actual amount of reparations that Germany was obliged to pay out was not the 132 billion marks decided in the London Schedule of 1921 but rather the 50 million marks stipulated in the A and B Bonds. Historian Sally Marks says the 112 billion marks in \"C bonds\" were entirely chimerical\u2014a device to fool the public into thinking Germany would pay much more. The actual total payout from 1920 to 1931 (when payments were suspended indefinitely) was 20 billion [[German gold mark]]s, worth about $5 billion US dollars or \u00a31 billion British pounds. 12.5 billion was cash that came mostly from loans from New York bankers. The rest was goods like coal and chemicals, or from assets like railway equipment. The reparations bill was fixed in 1921 on the basis of a German capacity to pay, not on the basis of Allied claims. The highly publicized rhetoric of 1919 about paying for all the damages and all the veterans' benefits was irrelevant for the total, but it did determine how the recipients spent their share. Germany owed reparations chiefly to France, Britain, Italy and Belgium; the US received $100 million.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Marks | first1 = Sally | year = 1978 | title = The Myths of Reparations | journal = Central European History | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 231\u201355 | jstor=4545835 | doi=10.1017/s0008938900018707}}</ref>\n\n===Economic collapse and political problems, 1929\u20131933===\nThe [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] marked the beginning of the worldwide [[Great Depression]], which hit Germany as hard as any nation. In July 1931, the ''Darmst\u00e4tter und Nationalbank'' \u2013 one of the biggest German banks \u2013 failed. In early 1932, the number of unemployed had soared to more than 6,000,000.\n\nOn top of the collapsing economy came a political crisis: the political parties represented in the ''Reichstag'' were unable to build a governing majority in the face of escalating extremism from the far right (the Nazis, NSDAP) and the far left (the Communists, KPD). In March 1930, President Hindenburg appointed [[Heinrich Br\u00fcning]] Chancellor, invoking article 48 of Weimar's constitution, which allowed him to override the Parliament. To push through his package of austerity measures against a majority of Social Democrats, Communists and the NSDAP (Nazis), Br\u00fcning made use of emergency decrees and dissolved Parliament. In March and April 1932, Hindenburg was re-elected in the [[German presidential election, 1932|German presidential election of 1932]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=247\u2013283}}\n\nThe Nazi Party was the largest party in the national elections of 1932. On 31 July 1932 it received 37.3% of the votes, and in the election on 6 November 1932 it received less, but still the largest share, 33.1%, making it the biggest party in the ''Reichstag''. The Communist KPD came third, with 15%.<ref>Richard F. Hamilton, '' Who Voted for Hitler?''

The Nazis were particularly successful among Protestants, among unemployed young voters, among the lower middle class in the cities and among the rural population. It was weakest in Catholic areas and in large cities. On 30 January 1933, pressured by former Chancellor [[Franz von Papen]] and other conservatives, President Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=283\u2013308}}\n\n===Science and culture===\n{{Main|Science and technology in Germany}}\nThe Weimar years saw a flowering of [[German science]] and high culture, before the Nazi regime resulted in a decline in the scientific and cultural life in Germany and forced many renowned scientists and writers to flee.\nGerman recipients dominated the [[Nobel laureates by country|Nobel prizes in science]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://nobelprize.org/ | title = Nobel Prize | publisher= Nobelprize.org |accessdate=19 November 2009}}</ref> Germany dominated the world of physics before 1933, led by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]], [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]], [[Wilhelm Conrad R\u00f6ntgen]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Max Planck]] and [[Werner Heisenberg]].

The [[Gestapo]] (secret police) under [[Heinrich Himmler]] destroyed the political opposition and persecuted the Jews, trying to force them into exile, while taking their property. The Party took control of the courts, local government, and all civic organizations except the Protestant and Catholic churches. All expressions of public opinion were controlled by Hitler's propaganda minister, [[Joseph Goebbels]], who made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic speaking. The Nazi state idolized Hitler as its F\u00fchrer (leader), putting all powers in his hands. [[Nazi propaganda]] centered on Hitler and was quite effective in creating what historians called the \"Hitler Myth\"\u2014that Hitler was all-wise and that any mistakes or failures by others would be corrected when brought to his attention.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Kershaw | authorlink =Ian Kershaw| title=[[The \"Hitler Myth\": Image and Reality in the Third Reich]] | year=2001}}</ref> In fact Hitler had a narrow range of interests and decision making was diffused among overlapping, feuding power centers; on some issues he was passive, simply assenting to pressures from whoever had his ear.

On the evening of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|''Reichstag'' building was set afire]]. Hitler swiftly blamed an alleged Communist uprising, and convinced President Hindenburg to sign the [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], which rescinded most German civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges or a court order. Four thousand members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] were arrested.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329\u2013334}} Communist agitation was banned, but at this time not the Communist Party itself. Communists and Socialists were brought into hastily prepared [[Nazi concentration camp]]s such as [[Kemna concentration camp]], where they were at the mercy of the [[Gestapo]], the newly established secret police force. Communist ''Reichstag'' deputies were taken into [[protective custody]] (despite their constitutional privileges).\n\n[[File:WWII, Europe, Germany, \"Nazi Hierarchy, Hitler, Goering, Goebbels, Hess\", The Desperate Years p143 - NARA - 196509.jpg|thumb|Some of the leaders of the Nazi regime (left to right): [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]], [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Rudolf Hess]]]]\nDespite the terror and unprecedented propaganda, the last free General Elections of 5 March 1933, while resulting in 43.9% failed to gave the majority for the NSDAP as Hitler had hoped. Together with the [[German National People's Party]] (DNVP), however, he was able to form a slim majority government. In March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]], passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} To obtain the two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill, accommodations were made to the Catholic [[Centre Party (Germany)|Centre Party]], and the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several Social Democratic deputies from attending, and the Communists deputies had already been banned.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=336}} This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws\u2014even laws that violated the constitution\u2014without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=351}} The Enabling Act formed the basis for the dictatorship, dissolution of the [[States of Germany|L\u00e4nder]]; the trade unions and all political parties other than the Nazi Party were suppressed. A centralised totalitarian state was established, no longer based on the liberal [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] constitution. Germany left the [[League of Nations]]. The coalition parliament was rigged by defining the absence of arrested and murdered deputies as voluntary and therefore cause for their exclusion as wilful absentees. Subsequently, in July the Centre Party was voluntarily dissolved in a ''quid pro quo'' with the [[Holy See|Pope]] under the ''anti-communist'' [[Pope Pius XI]] for the ''[[Reichskonkordat]]''; and by these manoeuvres Hitler achieved movement of these Catholic voters into the Nazi Party, and a long-awaited international diplomatic acceptance of his regime. According to Professor Dick Geary the Nazis gained a larger share of their vote in Protestant areas than in Catholic areas, in the elections held between 1928 and November 1932.<ref>{{cite journal | first=Dick | last=Geary | title=Who voted for the Nazis?

In response, Hitler used the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] and Gestapo to purge the entire SA leadership\u2014along with a number of Hitler's political adversaries (such as [[Gregor Strasser]] and former chancellor [[Kurt von Schleicher]]). It became known as the [[Night of the Long Knives]] and took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=309\u2013314}} As a reward, the SS became an independent organisation under the command of the ''[[Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS]]'' Heinrich Himmler. He would rise to become Chief of German Police in June 1936 and already had control over the concentration camps system. Upon Hindenburg's death on 2 August 1934, Hitler's cabinet passed a law proclaiming the presidency to be vacant and transferred the role and powers of the head of state to Hitler as Chancellor and F\u00fchrer (Leader).\n\n===Antisemitism and the Holocaust===\n{{main|History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933\u201345)|The Holocaust}}\n[[File:Buchenwald-bei-Weimar-am-24-April-1945.jpg|thumb|U.S. Senator [[Alben W.

When opponents tried to appease him, he accepted the gains that were offered, then went to the next target. That aggressive strategy worked as Germany pulled out of the [[League of Nations]] (1933), rejected the [[Versailles Treaty]] and began to re-arm (1935), won back the Saar (1935), remilitarized the Rhineland (1936), formed an alliance (\"axis\") with Mussolini's Italy (1936), sent massive military aid to Franco in the Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339), annexed Austria (1938), took over Czechoslovakia after the British and French ''appeasement'' of the Munich Agreement of 1938, formed a peace pact with [[Joseph Stalin]]'s Soviet Union in August 1939, and finally invaded Poland on 1 September 1939.

On 12 March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, where an attempted Nazi coup had been unsuccessful in 1934. When Austrian-born Hitler entered [[Vienna]], he was greeted by loud cheers. Four weeks later, 99% of Austrians voted in favour of the annexation ([[Anschluss]]) of their country Austria to the [[German Reich]]. After Austria, Hitler turned to [[Czechoslovakia]], where the 3.5&nbsp;million-strong [[Sudeten German]] minority was demanding equal rights and self-government. At the [[Munich Agreement|Munich Conference]] of September 1938, Hitler, the Italian leader Benito Mussolini, British Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]] and French Prime Minister [[\u00c9douard Daladier]] agreed upon the cession of Sudeten territory to the German Reich by [[Czechoslovakia]]. Hitler thereupon declared that all of German Reich's territorial claims had been fulfilled. However, hardly six months after the Munich Agreement, in March 1939, Hitler used the smoldering quarrel between [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] and [[Czechs]] as a pretext for taking over the rest of Czechoslovakia as the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. In the same month, he secured the return of [[Klaip\u0117da Region|Memel]] from [[Lithuania]] to Germany.

That meant that people had accumulated large paper assets, and that official prices and wages did not reflect reality, as the black market dominated the economy and more than half of all transactions were taking place unofficially. On 21 June 1948, the Western Allies withdrew the old currency and replaced it with the new [[Deutsche Mark]] at the rate of 1 new per 10 old. This wiped out 90% of government and private debt, as well as private savings. Prices were decontrolled, and labor unions agreed to accept a 15% wage increase, despite the 25% rise in prices. The result was that prices of German export products held steady, while profits and earnings from exports soared and were poured back into the economy. The currency reforms were simultaneous with the $1.4 billion in [[Marshall Plan]] money coming in from the United States, which was used primarily for investment.\n\nIn addition, the Marshall Plan forced German companies, as well as those in all of Western Europe, to modernize their business practices and take account of the international market. Marshall Plan funding helped overcome bottlenecks in the surging economy caused by remaining controls (which were removed in 1949), and Marshall Plan business reforms opened up a greatly expanded market for German exports. Overnight, consumer goods appeared in the stores, because they could be sold for realistic prices, emphasizing to Germans that their economy had turned a corner.<ref name=tipton />\n\nThe success of the currency reform angered the Soviets, who cut off all road, rail, and canal links between the western zones and [[West Berlin]]. This was the [[Berlin Blockade]], which lasted from 24 June 1948 to 12 May 1949. In response, the U.S. and Britain launched an airlift of food and coal and distributed the new currency in West Berlin as well.

Lambsdorff argued that the result would be economic growth, which would itself solve both the social problems and the financial problems. As a consequence, the FDP switched allegiance to the CDU and Schmidt lost his parliamentary majority in 1982.

Thousands of East Germans also tried to reach the West by staging sit-ins at West German diplomatic facilities in other East European capitals, most notably in Prague. The exodus generated demands within East Germany for political change, and [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|mass demonstrations in several cities]] continued to grow.\n\nUnable to stop the growing civil unrest, [[Erich Honecker]] was forced to resign in October, and on 9 November, East German authorities unexpectedly allowed East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany. Hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity; new crossing points were opened in the Berlin Wall and along the border with West Germany. This led to the acceleration of the process of reforms in East Germany that ended with the [[German reunification]] that came into force on 3 October 1990.<ref>For primary sources in English translation and a brief survey see Konrad H.

He had enough support to overcome opposition from the trade unions and the SPD's left wing.

Germany (especially under Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]) was one of the main supporters of admitting many East European countries to the EU. Germany is at the forefront of European states seeking to exploit the momentum of monetary union to advance the creation of a more unified and capable European political, defence and security apparatus. German Chancellor Schr\u00f6der expressed an interest in a permanent seat for Germany in the [[UN Security Council]], identifying France, Russia, and Japan as countries that explicitly backed Germany's bid. Germany formally adopted the Euro on 1 January 1999 after permanently fixing the Deutsche Mark rate on 21 December 1998.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\nSince 1990, the German [[Bundeswehr]] has participated in a number of peacekeeping and disaster relief operations abroad. Since 2002, German troops formed part of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war in Afghanistan]], resulting in the first German [[German Armed Forces casualties in Afghanistan|casualties]] in combat missions since World War II.\n\nIn [[Late-2000s recession|the worldwide economic recession]] that began in 2008, Germany did relatively well. However, the economic instability of Greece and several other EU nations in 2010\u201311 forced Germany to reluctantly sponsor a massive financial rescue.\n\nIn the wake of the disaster to the nuclear industry in Japan following its 2011 earthquake and tsunami, German public opinion turned sharply against [[nuclear power in Germany]], which produces a fourth of the electricity supply. In response Merkel has announced plans to close down the nuclear system over the next decade, and to rely even more heavily on wind and other alternative energy sources, in addition to coal and natural gas.<ref>{{cite web | first=Steven |last=Mufson |title=Germany to close all of its nuclear plants by 2022 | publisher =Washington Post | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/germany-to-close-all-of-its-nuclear-plants-by-2022/2011/05/30/AG0op1EH_story.html | date= 30 May 2011}}</ref> For further information, see [[Germany in 2011]].\n\nGermany was affected by the [[European migrant crisis]] in 2015 as it became the final destination of choice for many asylum seekers from [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]] entering the EU.

Proponents of the ''Sonderweg'' theory such as [[Fritz Fischer]] point to such events of the [[Revolution of 1848]], the [[authoritarianism]] of the Second Empire and the continuation of the Imperial elite into the Weimar and Nazi periods. Opponents such as [[Gerhard Ritter]] of the ''Sonderweg'' theory argue that proponents of the theory are guilty of seeking selective examples, and there was much contingency and chance in German history. In addition, there was much debate within the supporters of the ''Sonderweg'' concept as for the reasons for the ''Sonderweg'', and whether or not the ''Sonderweg'' ended in 1945. Was there a Sonderweg? Winkler says:\n:\"For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany's deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a 'unique German path.' And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the 'normal path.'\"<ref>Heinrich August Winkler, ''Germany: The Long Road West'' (2006), vol 1 p 1</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Germany}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Conservatism in Germany]]\n* [[Economic history of Germany]]\n* [[Feminism in Germany]]\n* [[Family tree of the German monarchs|German monarchs Family tree]]\n* [[History of Austria]]\n* [[History of Berlin]]\n* [[History of German foreign policy]]\n* [[History of German journalism]]\n* [[History of German women]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Germany]]\n* [[Liberalism in Germany]]\n* [[List of Chancellors of Germany]]\n* [[List of German monarchs]]\n* Medieval [[Ostsiedlung|East Colonisation]] by German noblemen and farmers\n* [[Military history of Germany]]\n* [[Names of Germany]] for terminology applied to Germany\n* [[Politics of Germany]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of Germany]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book|last=Barraclough|first=Geoffrey|title=The Origins of Modern Germany?|year=1984|ref={{sfnref|Barraclough|1984}}}}\n* {{cite book | last = Beevor | first = Antony | title = [[The Second World War (book)|The Second World War]] | year = 2012 | publisher = Little, Brown | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-316-02374-0 | ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bradbury|first=Jim|author-link=Jim Bradbury|title=The Routledge Companion to Medieval Warfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3FRsBgAAQBAJ|series=Routledge Companions to History|publisher=[[Routledge Press|Routledge]]|date=2004|isbn=9781134598472|ref={{sfnref|Bradbury|2004}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Bowman|first=Alan K.|first2=Peter|last2=Garnsey|first3=Averil|last3=Cameron|title=The Crisis of Empire, A.D. 193\u2013337|series=The Cambridge Ancient History|volume=12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2005|isbn=0-521-30199-8|ref={{sfnref|Bowman|2005}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Carr|first=William|title=A History of Germany: 1815-1990|date=1991|edition=4|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-340-55930-6|ref={{sfnref|Carr|1991}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Carsten|first=Francis|title=The Origins of Prussia|year=1958|ref={{sfnref|Carsten|1958}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Claster|first=Jill N.|title=Medieval Experience: 300\u20131400|publisher=[[New York University Press]]|year=1982|isbn=0-8147-1381-5|ref={{sfnref|Claster|1982}}}}\n* {{cite book|last=Damminger|first=Folke|chapter=Dwellings, Settlements and Settlement Patterns in Merovingian Southwest Germany and adjacent areas|editor-last=Wood|editor-first=Ian|editor-link=Ian S.

He had three sisters, [[Demeter]], [[Hestia]], and [[Hera]], as well as two brothers, [[Poseidon]] and [[Zeus]], the youngest of the three.\nUpon reaching adulthood, Zeus managed to force his father to disgorge his siblings. After their release, the six younger gods, along with allies they managed to gather, challenged the elder gods for power in the [[Titanomachy]], a divine war. The war lasted for ten years and ended with the victory of the younger gods. Following their victory, according to a single famous passage in the ''[[Iliad]]'' (xv.187\u201393), Hades and his two brothers, Poseidon and Zeus, drew lots<ref>[[Walter Burkert]], in ''The Orientalizing Revolution: Near Eastern Influence on Greek Culture in the Early Archaic Age'', 1992, (pp 90ff) compares this single reference with the Mesopotamian ''[[Atra-Hasis]]'': \"the basic structure of both texts is astonishingly similar.\" The drawing of lots is not the usual account; [[Hesiod]] (''[[Theogony]]'', 883) declares that Zeus overthrew his father and was acclaimed king by the other gods. \"There is hardly another passage in Homer which comes so close to being a translation of an [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] epic,\" Burkert concludes (p. 91).</ref> for realms to rule. Zeus received the sky, Poseidon received the seas, and Hades received the underworld,<ref>Poseidon speaks: \"For when we threw the lots I received the grey sea as my abode, Hades drew the murky darkness, Zeus, however, drew the wide sky of brightness and clouds; the earth is common to all, and spacious Olympus.\" ''Iliad 15.187''</ref> the unseen realm to which the souls of the dead go upon leaving the world as well as any and all things beneath the earth.

His wrath was equally terrible for anyone who tried to cheat death or otherwise crossed him, as [[Sisyphus]] and [[Pirithous]] found out to their sorrow. While usually indifferent to his subjects, Hades was very focused on the punishment of these two people; particularly [[Pirithous]], as he entered the underworld in an attempt to steal Persephone for himself, and consequently was forced onto the \"Chair of Forgetfulness\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Another myth is about the Roman god [[Asclepius]] who was originally a demigod, fathered by Apollo and birthed by [[Coronis (mythology)|Coronis]], a Thessalian princess. During his lifetime, he became a famous and talented physician, who eventually was able to bring the dead back to life. Feeling cheated, Plouton persuaded Zeus to kill him with a thunderbolt. After his death, he was brought to Olympus where he became a god.<ref>Gayley, [https://archive.org/stream/classicmythsinen1911gayl#page/104/mode/2up p. 104].</ref> Hades was only depicted outside of the Underworld once in myth, and even that is believed to have been an instance where he had just left the gates of the Underworld, which was when [[Heracles]] shot him with an arrow as Hades was  attempting to defend the city of Plyus.<ref name=\":6\">Tripp, p. 256.</ref> After he was shot, however, he traveled to Olympus to heal.

None of them were pleased with what they witnessed in the realm of the dead. In particular, the Greek war hero [[Achilles]], whom Odysseus conjured with a blood [[libation]], said:\n{{Quote|<poem>O shining Odysseus, never try to console me for dying.\nI would rather follow the plow as thrall to another\nman, one with no land allotted to him and not much to live on,\nthan be a king over all the perished dead.</poem>|source=Achilles' soul to Odysseus.

Since to many, simply to say the word \"Hades\" was frightening, [[euphemism]]s were pressed into use. Since precious minerals come from under the earth (i.e., the \"underworld\" ruled by Hades), he was considered to have control of these as well, and was referred to as \u03a0\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd (''Plouton'', related to the word for \"wealth\"), Latinized as [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]].

The dangerous region that Kore let herself be lured to in search of flowers was likely not originally connected to Plouton but to Dionysus, as Dionysus himself had the strange surname of \u2018the gaping one\u2019, though despite this the notion that the wine god in his quality as the Lord of the Underworld does not appear on the surface of the hymn.

The fact that Demeter refuses to drink wine on the grounds that it would be against themis indicates that she is well aware of who Persephone\u2019s abductor is, that it is the Subterranean cover name of Dionysus. The critic of the mysteries, the severe philosopher Herakleitos once declared \u201cHades is the same as Dionysos.\u201d The subterranean wine god was the ravisher, so how could Demeter accept something that was his gift to mankind\" [P. 40]</ref> votive marble images<ref>''Summary of Karl Kerenyi:''\n\n\"The book later refers to Herakles initiation into the Eleusinian Mysteries so that he may enter the Underworld.

Kore is shown with her mother Demeter and a snake twined around the Mystery basket, foreshadowing the secret, as making friends with snakes was Dionysian [P. 58].\nThe god of the Anthesteria was Dionysus, who celebrated his marriage in Athens amid flowers, the opening of wine jars, and the rising up of the souls of the dead [P. 149]. \nThere are two reliefs in a marble votive relief of the fourth century BCE. One depicts Kore crowning her mother Demeter, the deities at the second altar are Persephone and her husband Dionysus as the recumbent god has the features of the bearded Dionysus rather than of Plouton. In his right hand, he raises not a cornucopia, the symbol of wealth, but a wine vessel and in his left, he bears the goblet for the wine. Over their heads an inscription reads \u201cTo the God and Goddess\u201d [P. 151, 152]. \nThe fragments of a gilded jar cover of the Kerch type show Dionysus, Demeter, little Ploutos, Kore, and a curly-haired boy clad in a long garment, one of the first son\u2019s of the Eleusinian king who was the first to be initiated. \nOn another vase, Dionysus sits on his omphalos with his thryrsos in his left hand, sitting opposite Demeter, looking at each other severely.

The duplication of the mystery god as subterranean father and subterranean son, as Father Zagreus and the child Zagreus, husband and son of Persephone, has more to do with the mysteries of Dionysus than with the Eleusinian Mysteries. But a duplication of the chthonian, mystical Dionysus is provided even by his youthful aspect, which became distinguished and classical as the son of Semele from the son of Persephone.

Particularly at Eleusis, the Pluto cult was for a deity who, like Persephone and Demeter, was favourably disposed to humans. He was frequently portrayed as a majestic elder with a sceptre, ranch, cornucopia, pomegranate, or drinking vessel in his hand; sometimes he was accompanied by an eagle. His iconography resembled that of Zeus, and especially that of some chthonic personification of the ruler of the gods, above all Zeus Meilichios. We can now go a step further. The nearest equivalent to the contrast between Hades and Pluto as presented in the Theophile epigram can be found in the Orphic Hymns, which are assumed to have originated from the \u03a4\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 of the Dionysiac mystic circles in Asia Minor of the 1st \u2013 3rd centuries. Hymn 41 worships Antaia, i.e. Demeter, the goddess who had searched for her daughter in Hades and discovered her in \u2018the sacred bed of the sacred chthonic Zeus\u2019. This formulation in itself is not surprising because the name Zeus (as a synonym for a deity and ruler) was used in reference to Hades-Pluto as the ruler of the underworld. In an interesting, though, sadly, only partly preserved inscription from Appia-Murathanlar in the Tembris Valley (in 3rd century AD Phrygia) the deceased appeals to \u201cZeus, god of the dead [\u03c6\u03b8\u03b9\u03b7\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd*], Pluto\u201d to protect his grave. The term \u201cChthonic Zeus\u201d could, however, mean something more than a mere euphemism for the name Hades. The idea of defining Zeus as \u03c7\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 (\u03c7\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2) \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 or simply Hades had been present in ancient Greek literature from Homer to Nonnos. This was a sort of extension, aspect or \u2018shadow\u2019 of the universal power of Zeus in the kingdom of the dead, where he was the judge of the dead and the also the consort of Persephone-Kore.Moreover, he was the provider of riches, \u03a0\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2; a personification which was abbreviated to \u03a0\u03bb\u03bf\u03cd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd. Among other things, he controlled the crops and it was to him (as well as to Demeter) that the farmers turned for the promise of a good harvest. These are hardly well known traditions today. Some scholars maintain that their obscurity is on account of the secret role they played in the mysteries. \u2026 Therefore the Orphics worshipped Pluto as the saviour and judge of the deceased, as Zeus \u03c7\u03b8\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. They most likely assumed that Zeus had another embodiment of sorts in the underworld, in Hades. The effect of this assumption was the myth, known to us in several versions, of how Zeus had lain with Persephone (even though she was his daughter). The so-called great Orphic tablet of Thurii refers to the abduction of Persephone by Zeus, who then fathers her son, Dionysus. Their child was revered by the Orphics as Dionysus Zagreus, Dionysus Iacchus, which shows how much importance they attached to the love affair of that particular couple.\" (''Images of Eternal Beauty in Funerary Verse Inscriptions of the Hellenistic Period'')</ref> Zeus was portrayed as having an incarnation in the underworld identifying him as literally being Hades and leading to Zeus and Hades essentially being two representations and different facets of the same god and extended divine power.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Early Greek Myth|last=Gantz|first=Timothy|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8018-5360-9|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>[[Timothy Gantz]] \"Thus it appears that at times Zeus and Hades represented simply different facets of a single extended divine power.\u201d (''Early Greek Myth'')</ref> This nature and aspect of Hades and Zeus  displayed in the Orphic stories is the explanation for why both Hades and Zeus are considered to be the father of Melino\u00eb and Zagreus.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Virgin Mother Goddesses of Antiquity|last=Rigoglioso|first=Marguerite|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=978-0-230-11312-1|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Marguerite-Rigoglioso/e/B001V8MSCI Marguerite Rigoglioso] \"Given that Zeus was also sometimes portrayed as having an incarnation in the underworld that was closely identified with Hades, we can read here that Zeus and Hades were essentially two representations of the same god.\n...\nThe idea of Hades equals Dionysus, and that this dual god impregnated Persephone in the Eleusinian tradition, therefore, is in perfect accord with the story that Zeus impregnated her with Dionysus in Orphic myth, given that Hades equals Zeus, as well.

The Styx forms the boundary between the upper and lower worlds. See also [[Eridanos (mythology)|Eridanos]].\n\nThe first region of Hades comprises the [[Asphodel Meadows|Fields of Asphodel]], described in ''[[Odyssey]]'' xi, where the shades of heroes wander despondently among lesser spirits, who twitter around them like bats.

In the forecourt of the palace of Hades and Persephone sit the three judges of the Underworld: [[Minos]], [[Rhadamanthus]], and [[Aeacus]]. There at the [[wikt:trivium#Latin|trivium]] sacred to [[Hecate]], where three roads meet, souls are judged, returned to the Fields of Asphodel if they are neither virtuous nor evil, sent by the road to Tartarus if they are impious or evil, or sent to [[Elysium]] (Islands of the Blessed) with the \"blameless\" heroes.\n\nIn the [[Sibylline oracles]], a curious hodgepodge of Greco-Roman and Judaeo-Christian elements, Hades again appears as the abode of the dead, and by way of [[folk etymology]], it even derives ''Hades'' from the name [[Adam and Eve|Adam]] (the first man), saying it is because he was the first to enter there.<ref>''Sibylline Oracles'' I, 101\u20133</ref> Owing to its appearance in the [[New Testament]] of the [[Bible]], ''Hades'' also has a [[Hades in Christianity|distinct meaning]] in [[Christianity]].\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{chart top|Hades' family tree&nbsp;<ref>This chart is based upon [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', unless otherwise noted.</ref>|collapsed=no}}\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | |URA |y|GAI |URA=[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]|GAI=[[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart|URA| | | | | | | | |CRO |y|RHE |URA=<small>Uranus'&nbsp;genitals</small>|CRO=[[Cronus]]|RHE=[[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| |ZEU |~|~|~|y|~|HER | |POS | |HAD | |DEM | |HES |ZEU=[[Zeus]]|HER=[[Hera]]|POS=[[Poseidon]]|HAD='''HADES'''|DEM=[[Demeter]]|HES=[[Hestia]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| | | |,|^|-|.| |!}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | |:| | | |!| |AAA |!|AAA= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.570 1.570\u2013579],  [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.338 14.338], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.312 8.312], Hephaestus was apparently the son of Hera and Zeus, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | |:| | | |!| | |!|BBB |BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+927 927\u2013929], Hephaestus was produced by Hera alone, with no father, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| || |!| | |!| |!}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| | |ARE | |HEP |HEP=[[Hephaestus]]|ARE=[[Ares]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |D|~|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MET |MET=[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| | | | |ATH |ATH=[[Athena]] <ref>According to [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+886 886\u2013890], of Zeus' children by his seven wives, Athena was the first to be conceived, but the last to be born; Zeus impregnated Metis then swallowed her, later Zeus himself gave birth to Athena \"from his head\", see Gantz, pp. 51\u201352, 83\u201384.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | |D|~|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|LET |LET=[[Leto]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| | | |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| | |APO | |ART |APO=[[Apollo]]|ART=[[Artemis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |D|~|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MAI |MAI=[[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| | | | |HER |HER=[[Hermes]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |D|~|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|SEM |SEM=[[Semele]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |:| | | | |DIO |DIO=[[Dionysus]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |L|~|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|DIO |DIO=[[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]]}}\n{{chart|border=0|AAA | | | | | | |BBB|AAA=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+183 183\u2013200], Aphrodite was born from Uranus' severed genitals, see Gantz, pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>|BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to [[Homer]], Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.374 3.374], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:20.105 20.105]; ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.308 8.308], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.320 320]) and Dione (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.370 5.370\u201371]), see Gantz, pp. 99\u2013100.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |`|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.|!}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | |APH |APH=[[Aphrodite]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{main|Hades in popular culture}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Greek mythology|Hellenismos}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Angra Mainyu]]\n* [[Ereshkigal]]\n* [[Ghosts in Mesopotamian religions]]\n* [[Irkalla]]\n* [[Last Judgment]]\n* [[Osiris]]\n* [[Saveasi'uleo]]\n* [[Shiva]]\n* [[The Golden Bough (mythology)]]\n* [[Yama (East Asia)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* Bailly, Anatole, ''Dictionnaire Grec - Gran\u00e7ais'', 26th ed.

For example, if you type \"UK\" in the search box or click on the wikilink [[UK]], you will be taken to the article [[United Kingdom]] with a note at the top of the page: \"<span style=\"font-size: 84%; line-height: 1.2em; color: rgb(84, 84, 84);\">(Redirected from {{noredirect|UK}})</span>\". This is because the page {{Noredirect|UK}} contains special wikitext which defines it as a redirect page and indicates the target article. It is also possible to redirect to a specific [[Help:Section|section]] of the target page, using more advanced syntax.\n\nRedirect pages can contain other content below the redirect, such as [[:Template:R template index|redirect category templates]], and category links (which provide a way to list article sections in categories).\n\nRedirects are used to help people arrive more quickly at the page they want to read; this page contains guidance on how to use them properly. For technical help relating to how redirects work, see '''[[Help:Redirect]]'''. Other relevant pages are [[Wikipedia:Double redirects]], [[Wikipedia:Hatnote#Redirect|Wikipedia:Hatnote \u00a7&nbsp;Redirect]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Redirect|WikiProject Redirect]].\n\n== Purposes of redirects ==\n{{Anchor|reasons|What do we use redirects for?}}{{Shortcut|WP:POFR|WP:RPURPOSE}}\n\nReasons for creating and maintaining redirects include:\n* Alternative names redirect to the [[Wikipedia:Article titles|most appropriate article title]] (for example, [[Edison Arantes do Nascimento]] redirects to [[Pel\u00e9]]).\n* Plurals (for example, [[Greenhouse gases]] redirects to [[Greenhouse gas]]).\n* Closely related words (for example, [[Symbiont]] redirects to [[Symbiosis]]).\n* Adjectives or adverbs point to noun forms (e.g., [[Treasonous]] redirects to [[Treason]])\n* Less specific forms of names, for which the article subject is still the [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary topic]]. For example, [[Einstein]] redirects to [[Albert Einstein]], whereas [[Johnson]] is a disambiguation page rather than a redirect, since no Johnson is regarded as the primary topic for that name.\n* More specific forms of names (for example, [[Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union]] redirects to [[Articles of Confederation]]).\n* Abbreviations and initialisms (for example, [[DSM-IV]] redirects to [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]). But often an abbreviation will have multiple meanings, none of which is a [[WP:PRIMARYTOPIC|primary topic]]\u2014in that case a [[WP:Disambiguation|disambiguation]] page should be created rather than a redirect.\n* Alternative spellings or punctuation. For example, [[Colour]] redirects to [[Color]], and [[Al-Jazeera]] redirects to [[Al Jazeera]].\n* Punctuation issues\u2014titles containing [[en dash|dashes]] should have redirects using [[hyphen-minus|hyphens]].\n* Representations using ASCII characters, that is, common transliterations (for example, [[Pele]] also redirects to [[Pel\u00e9]] while [[Kurt Goedel]] and [[Kurt Godel]] redirect to [[Kurt G\u00f6del]]).\n* Likely misspellings (for example, [[Condoleeza Rice]] redirects to [[Condoleezza Rice]]).\n* Likely alternative capitalizations (for example, [[Natural Selection]] redirects to [[Natural selection]]). This is not necessary for user searches made via Wikipedia's search engine, but may aid linking from other articles and external sites, as well as direct URL entry.\n* To comply with the maintenance of nontrivial edit history, pursuant to [[Wikipedia:Merging#PROMERGE]] for copyright licensing requirements.\n* Sub-topics or other topics which are described or listed within a wider article. (Such redirects are often targeted to a particular section of the article.)\n* Redirects to disambiguation pages that do not contain \"(disambiguation)\" in the title (for example, [[Durham (disambiguation)]] redirects to [[Durham]]). These help maintenance by allowing deliberate links to disambiguation pages to be distinguished from links that need to be disambiguated.\n* [[WP:Shortcut|Shortcuts]] (for example, [[Wikipedia:V]] redirects to [[Wikipedia:Verifiability]]). This is commonly done in [[WP:Project namespace|project space]], but not in article space.\n* Old-style [[Wikipedia:CamelCase and Wikipedia|CamelCase]] links (if already in existence) ([[AnnaKournikova]] redirects to [[Anna Kournikova]]).\n* Links auto-generated from [[Exchangeable image file format]] information ([[Adobe Photoshop CS Windows]] redirects to [[Adobe Photoshop]]).\n* Finding [[Help:What links here#Limitations|what links to a section]], when links are made to the redirect rather than the section.\n\nThere are [[Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages|redirect templates]] to explain the [[Wikipedia:Redirect#PLA|reason]] for a redirect.\n\nNote that redirects to other Wikimedia projects, other websites, or [[Special:SpecialPages|special pages]] do not work. These should be avoided or replaced with a {{Tl|soft redirect}} template. Soft redirects are also used in [[Help:Category|category space]] (using the {{Tl|category redirect}} template).\n\n== How to make a redirect ==\n{{main|Help:Redirect}}\n<!-- <div class=\"notice\" style=\"background:#def; border:1px solid #468; padding:0.5em; margin:0.5em auto; background-color:#EBFFEB;\"><center>Note: For a [[Wikipedia:Autoconfirmed article creation trial|trial period]] from September 14, 2017 to at least March 14, 2018, users will not be able to create pages, including redirects, directly in the [[Wikipedia:What is an article?#Namespace|article mainspace]] until their accounts are [[Wikipedia:User access levels#Autoconfirmed and confirmed users|autoconfirmed]] \u2013 an editing threshold passed when a user's account is at least 4 days (96 hours) old, and has made more than ten edits. Non-autoconfirmed users can request creation of redirects at [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Redirects]].</center></div> -->\n\n=== Editing the source directly ===\nTo create a basic redirect using the source editor, type <code><nowiki>#REDIRECT&nbsp;[[target page name here]]</nowiki></code> as the only text on the page. The capitalization of the word <code>REDIRECT</code> doesn't matter. For instance, if you were redirecting from \"{{Noredirect|UK}}\" to \"[[United Kingdom]]\", this would be the entire body of {{Noredirect|UK|the \"UK\" page}}: \n\n<code><nowiki>#REDIRECT&nbsp;[[United Kingdom]]</nowiki></code>\n\n=== Using VisualEditor ===\nTo create a redirect using the [[Wikipedia:VisualEditor|VisualEditor]]:\n# Open the \"page options\" menu (icon with three parallel horizontal bars) at the top right of the editor\n# Select \"Page settings\"\n# Check the box marked \"Redirect this page to\"\n# Enter the name of the target page in the text box below the checkbox\n# Click on the blue \"Apply changes\" button\n# Save the page. You may enter an edit summary, or an automatic summary will be generated.\n\n=== When moving a page ===\nRedirects can also be automatically created when you [[Wikipedia:MOVE|move (rename) an existing page]].\n\n== How to edit a redirect or convert it into an article ==\n{{shortcut|WP:EDRED|WP:RTOA}}\nSometimes an existing redirect should really be handled by a full article, per [[:Category:Redirects with possibilities]]. For example, the name of a notable musician (who does not yet have an article) may instead be a redirect to an existing article about a band of which the musician is a member. In this case, you may edit the redirect to make it into an article. Also, if an existing redirect points to the wrong page, you may edit the redirect to point to a different page.\n\nIf you want to edit a redirect page you must use a special technique in order to get to the redirect page itself. This is because when you try to go straight to the redirect page and edit it, the redirect page will automatically redirect you to its target page (because this is what a redirect page is meant to do). Below is an example of why you might need to go to a redirect page itself (to do a small edit) and how to actually get there.\n\nFor example, say [[Trygve Halvdan Lie]] did not have his own article, and so this link was a redirect to the page [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. If, later on, the page [[Trygve Lie]] was created as a biography, the page [[Trygve Halvdan Lie]] should be changed to redirect to [[Trygve Lie]] per [[WP:COMMONNAME]]. To do this, go to the redirect page by clicking the existing redirect note on the target page, which in this case would read \"(Redirected from [[Trygve Halvdan Lie]])\". Once there, you may click the \"Edit\" tab, and change the page from\n\n<code><nowiki>#REDIRECT&nbsp;[[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]</nowiki></code>\n:to\n<code><nowiki>#REDIRECT&nbsp;[[Trygve Lie]]</nowiki></code>\n\nWhen adding or changing a redirect, always verify the links that already point there. For instance, if another person named Trygve Lie becomes very well known, it would make sense to make [[Trygve Lie]] a redirect to his page (after renaming the existing [[Trygve Lie]] page). Such a change cannot be made without changing all the preexisting links to [[Trygve Lie]]; these links can be found by clicking on [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Trygve_Lie|What links here]] in the left hand menu.\n\n== Targeted and untargeted redirects ==\n{{Shortcut|WP:TARGET|WP:RSECT}}\n{{see also|MOS:LINK2SECT }}\n\nMost redirects are ''untargeted'', i.e. they lead simply to a page, not to any specific section of the page. This is usually done when there is more than one possible name under which an article might be sought (for example, [[Cellphone]] redirects to the article [[Mobile phone]]). For deciding which should be the actual title of the article, see [[WP:Article titles|Article titles]].\n\nIt is also possible to create a ''targeted redirect'', i.e. a redirect to a particular point on the target page\u2014either a [[Help:Section|section header]] or an [[Help:Anchor|anchor]]. For example, the page [[Malia Obama]] contains the code <code><nowiki>#REDIRECT&nbsp;[[Family of Barack Obama#Malia and Sasha Obama]]</nowiki></code>, which redirects to the [[Family of Barack Obama#Malia and Sasha Obama|Malia and Sasha Obama]] section in the article [[Family of Barack Obama]]. Therefore, entering \"''Malia Obama''\" will bring the searcher straight to the content that deals with \"Malia and Sasha Obama\".\n\nConsider that when the target page is displayed, it is likely that the top of the page will not be shown, so the user may not see the helpful \"(redirected from... )\" text unless they know to scroll back to the top. This is less likely to cause confusion if the redirect is to a heading with the same name as the redirect.\n\nThe text given in the link on a targeted redirect page must exactly match the target section heading or anchor text, including capitalization and punctuation. (While spaces and underscores are interchangeable in the current implementation of the Wikimedia software, it is generally good practice and aids maintenance to use exactly the same spelling in links as is used in the corresponding targets also for these characters.) (In the absence of a match, the reader will simply be taken to the top of the target page.) It is often helpful to leave a [[WP:HIDDEN|hidden comment]] in the target text, to inform other editors that a section title is linked, so that if the title is altered, the redirect can be changed. For example:\n\n<pre><nowiki>\n ==Vaccine overload==\n <!-- linked from redirect [[Vaccine overload]] -->\n</nowiki></pre>\n\nTo ensure that a redirect will not break if a section title gets altered, or to create a redirect to a point on the page other than a section heading, create an explicit target anchor in the page, e.g., by using the {{Tl|anchor}} template. Alternative anchors for section headings are ideally placed directly in front of the text of the heading:\n {{nowrap|<code><nowiki>=={{Anchor|anchor name}}Section title==</nowiki></code>}}).\n\nThe anchor text will not be visible (unless the {{Tl|Visible anchor}} template is used), but it will serve as a permanent marker of that place on the page. Editors should generally not remove or alter such anchors without checking all incoming links and redirects. If several logically independent aspects of a topic are discussed under a single section header and should be linked to, it is sometimes useful to define separate anchors for them, if the current amount of information doesn't justify a division into multiple sections already. This makes it easier to rearrange contents on a page as it develops since those anchors can be moved with their corresponding contents without a need to fix up incoming links.\n\nFor example, in the [[Google search]] article, the text <code><nowiki>{{Anchor|calculator}}</nowiki></code> is placed at the point where ''Google Calculator'' is described. The title [[Google Calculator]] can then be redirected to [[Google search#calculator]].\n\n=== Warning ===\n# Don't give an anchor the same name as a section heading&nbsp;\u2013 this creates invalid code, as [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_8 anchor names must be unique].\n# Be careful with anchor capitalization&nbsp;\u2013 [http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/links.html#h-12.2.1 section redirects are case-sensitive in standards-compliant browsers].<!-- (XHTML standard is the same) -->\n\n== Double redirects ==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Double redirects}}\n\nThe software will not follow chains of more than one redirect \u2013 this is called a double redirect. A redirect should not be left pointing to another redirect page.\n\nDouble redirects often arise after a page is [[WP:MOVE|moved]] (renamed) \u2013 after moving a page, check whether there are any redirects to the old title (using the link on the move result page, or using [[WP:WHATLINKSHERE|\"What links here\"]]), and change them to redirect straight to the new title. Double redirects are usually fixed by a [[Wikipedia:Bots|bot]] in a few days; however, an editor should not leave behind any self-created double redirects.\n\n== Linking to a redirect ==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style (linking)#Redirects|l1=MoS linking redirects}}\n\nYou can link to a redirect page just as you can [[Help:Link|link]] to an article page by placing the redirect page name within a set of double brackets, such as: <div style=\"margin-left: 2em\"><code><nowiki>[[</nowiki>''Redirect page name''<nowiki>]]</nowiki></code></div> replacing ''Redirect page name'' with the name of the redirect page to link.\n\nTo link to a redirect page without following the underlying redirect, use: {{tlx|No redirect|''Redirect page name''}} replacing ''Redirect page name'' with the name of the redirect page to link. Clicking on a no-redirect link will send the reader to the redirect page rather than the final redirect destination.\n\n== Categorizing redirect pages ==\n{{Main|Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects}}\n\nMost redirect pages are not placed in article [[WP:Categorization|categories]]. There are three types of redirect categorization that are helpful and useful:\n* Maintenance categories are in use for particular types of redirects, such as [[:Category:Redirects from initialisms]], in which a redirect page may be sorted using the {{Tl|R from initialism}} template. One major use of these categories is to determine which redirects are fit for inclusion in a [[WP:Printability|printed subset]] of Wikipedia. See [[Wikipedia:Template messages/Redirect pages]] for functional and alphabetical lists of these templates.  A brief functional list of redirect category ([[WP:RCAT|rcat]]) templates is also found in the {{Tl|R template index}} navbar.\n* Sometimes a redirect is placed in an article category because the form of the redirected title is more appropriate to the context of that category, e.g. {{noredirect|Honey Lantree}}. (Redirects appear in italics in category listings.)\n* Discussion pages. If a discussion/talk page exists for a redirect, please ensure (1) that the talk page's Wikiproject banners are tagged with the \"class=Redirect\" parameter and (2) that the talk page is tagged at the TOP with the {{Tl|Talk page of redirect}} template.  If the discussion page is a redirect, then it may be tagged with appropriate redirect categorization templates (rcats).\n\n=== Redirects from moves ===\nWhen a page is renamed/moved, a redirect that is titled with the replaced page name is created and is automatically tagged with the {{Tl|R from move}} template.  This sorts the redirect into [[:Category:Redirects from moves]].\n\n== When should we delete a redirect? ==\n{{Anchor|CRD|crd|Criteria for redirect deletion}}{{Shortcut|WP:R#CRD}}\n\nTo delete a redirect '''without replacing it with a new article''', list it on [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion|redirects for discussion]]. See the [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|deletion policy]] for details on how to nominate pages for deletion.\n\nListing is not necessary if you just want to replace a redirect with an article, or change where it points: see [[meta:Help:Redirect#Changing a redirect|these instructions]] for help doing this. If you want to ''swap'' a redirect and an article, but are not able to move the article to the location of the redirect please use [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]] to request help from an [[Wikipedia:Administrators|admin]] in doing that.\n\n{{Wikipedia:Redirect/Deletion reasons}}\n\n{{Anchor|PLA|pla|ASTONISH|SURPRISE}}\n\n== What needs to be done on pages that are targets of redirects? ==\n{{Shortcut|WP:R#PLA|WP:R#ASTONISH}}\n{{Further|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Text formatting#Other uses}}\n\nWikipedia follows the \"[[Wikipedia:Guide to writing better articles#Principle of least astonishment|principle of least astonishment]]\"; after following a redirect, the reader's first question is likely to be: \"Hang on ... I wanted to read about ''this''. Why has the link taken me to ''that''?\" Make it clear to the reader that they ''have'' arrived in the right place.\n\nNormally, we try to make sure that all \"inbound redirects\" other than misspellings or other obvious close variants of the article title are mentioned in the first couple of paragraphs of the article or section to which the redirect goes. It will often be appropriate to '''bold''' the redirected term. For example:\n* '''James Tiptree Jr.''' (August&nbsp;24,&nbsp;1915&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;May&nbsp;19,&nbsp;1987) was the pen name of American science fiction author '''Alice Bradley Sheldon''' ...\n** [[James Tiptree Jr.]], redirects from [[Alice Sheldon]]\n\nBut insignificant or minor redirects can skip this:\n* [[Density of water]] redirects to [[Properties of water]].  There is no need to insert a bolded '''density of water''' sentence in the lead section; it is a minor subtopic of the article.\n\nIf the redirected term could have other meanings, a [[WP:Hatnote|hatnote]] ([[Wikipedia:HATTEST#Redirect|examples]]) should be placed at the top of the target article or targeted section that will direct readers to the other meanings or to a relevant [[WP:DAB|disambiguation]] page. This is usually done using one of the [[:Template:Redirect#\"\u2026 redirects here. For other uses, see \u2026\"|redirect disambiguation templates]] ([[Wikipedia:HATTEST#Redirect|examples]]).\n\nIt may also be helpful to [[Help:Searching|search]] the [[Help:Category#Listing all categories|List of Categories]] for [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Categories#Can I specify categories when searching?|related terms]]; adding a [[WP:HATNOTE|hatnote]] and a [[Help:Category|category link]] to the old term will make related pages easier to locate.\n\n== Redirects that replace previous articles ==\n{{Short|WP:BLANKANDREDIRECT|WP:BLAR}}\n{{See also|Wikipedia:Redirect#Reasons for not deleting|Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Redirection}}\n\nRemoving all content in a problematic article and replacing it with a redirect is common practice, known as '''blank-and-redirect'''. If other editors [[WP:BRD|disagree]] with this blanking, its contents can be recovered from [[Help:page history|page history]], as the article has not been formally [[WP:DEL|deleted]]. If editors cannot agree, the content issues should be discussed at the relevant talk page, and other methods of [[Wikipedia:Resolving disputes|dispute resolution]] should be used, such as restoring the article and nominating the article for [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion]] or listing on [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment]]s for further input.\n\nTo make it easier for other editors to find the history of the blanked article, it's good practice to add a short notice at the talk page of the target article, even if no content has been [[Wikipedia:Merging|merged]] there. This is specially useful if the blanked article had few visits and infrequent edits. If the redirect is replacing an article that had been deleted by an [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrator]], this notice is the only way for editors to know that a previous version of the article existed at all.\n\n=== Content of the replaced article ===\nIf the topic of the article can be reasonably thought to describe a notable topic, mark the redirect with the template\n{{Tl|Redirect with possibilities}} to indicate that [[Wikipedia:Redirect#How to edit a redirect or convert it into an article|it could be expanded in the future]]. You may also consider [[Wikipedia:Stubbing#Stubbing existing articles|turning the article into a stub]] by removing all unsourced content and keeping the valid references, instead of blanking it.\n\nNote that certain forms of blanking are not allowed. [[Wikipedia:Vandalism#Blanking, illegitimate|Illegitimate blanking]] of valid content without reason is considered [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]], a form of [[Wikipedia:disruptive editing|disruptive editing]]. Other forms of blank-and-redirect, although not vandalism, are still undesirable. If you want to [[WP:CUTPASTE|rename the article by cutting and pasting text]] to a new article with a different title, you should instead [[Wikipedia:Moving a page|move the page]] with the ''Move'' option. If you want to keep some content from the blanked article and add it to the target article, you should follow the instructions at {{section link|Wikipedia:Merging|How to merge}}. Both processes will create proper links to the edit history, which is required by the [[Wikipedia:Copyrights|Wikipedia license]] for legal reasons to [[Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia|preserve attribution of content to its authors]].\n\n== Do not \"fix\" links to redirects that are not broken ==\n{{Anchor|NOTBROKEN|notbroken}}{{Shortcut|WP:NOTBROKEN|WP:DONOTFIXIT}}\n{{Redirect|WP:NOTBROKE|text=You may be looking for {{section link|Wikipedia:Typo Team|Typos that do not need to be corrected}} or [[Wikipedia:If it ain't broke, don't fix it]]}}\n{{Further|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking#MOS:NOPIPE}}\n\nThere is usually nothing wrong with linking to redirects to articles.  Some editors are tempted, upon finding a link to a redirect page, to bypass the redirect and point the link directly at the target page.  However, changing to a piped link is beneficial only in a few cases.  Piping links solely to avoid redirects is generally a time-wasting exercise that can actually be detrimental.  It is almost never helpful to replace <code><nowiki>[[redirect]]</nowiki></code> with <code><nowiki>[[target|redirect]]</nowiki></code>.\n\nThat is, editors should not change, for instance, <code><nowiki>[[Franklin Roosevelt]]</nowiki></code> to <code><nowiki>[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]</nowiki></code> or <code><nowiki>[[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]]</nowiki></code> ''just'' to \"fix a redirect\".  However, it is perfectly acceptable to change it to <code><nowiki>[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]</nowiki></code> if for some reason it is preferred that \"Franklin D. Roosevelt\" actually appear in the visible text.\n\nReasons ''not'' to bypass redirects include:\n* Redirects can indicate [[:Category:Redirects with possibilities|possible future articles]] (see {{Tl|R with possibilities}}).\n* Introducing unnecessary invisible text makes the article more difficult to read in page source form.\n* Non-piped links make better use of the \"what links here\" tool, making it easier to track how articles are linked and helping with large-scale changes to links.\n* Shortcuts or redirects to embedded anchors or sections of articles or of [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines|Wikipedia's advice pages]] should never be bypassed, as the anchors or section headings on the page may change over time. Updating one redirect is far more efficient than updating dozens of piped links. (The [[toollabs:dispenser/cgi-bin/rdcheck.py|Rdcheck]] tool is extremely useful in such cases for finding which redirects need to be changed after an article is updated.)\n* Intentional links to [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation|disambiguation pages]] always use the title with \"(disambiguation)\", even if that is a redirect.\n* If editors persistently use a redirect instead of an article title, it may be that the article needs to be moved rather than the redirect changed. As such the systematic \"fixing of redirects\" may eradicate useful information which can be used to help decide on the \"best\" article title.\n\n{{Anchor|Bypass redirects in navigational templates|template link fix|template linkfix|templatelinkfix|TLF}}Good reasons to bypass redirects include:{{Shortcut|WP:BRINT}}\n* It is usually preferable not to use redirected links in navigational templates, such as those found at the bottom of many articles (e.g., {{Tl|US Presidents}} at the end of [[George Washington]]). When the template is placed on an article and contains a ''direct'' link to the same article (rather than a redirect), the direct link will display in '''bold''' (and not as a link), making it easier to navigate through a series of articles using the template. There are exceptions to this exception: where a redirect represents a distinct sub-topic within a larger article and is not merely a variant name, it is preferable to leave the redirect in the template.\n* It may be appropriate to make this kind of change if the hint that appears when a user hovers over the link is misleading.\n* Spelling errors and other mistakes should be corrected. Don't link to a misspelled redirect. This does not necessarily mean that the misspelled redirect should be deleted (see {{tl|R from misspelling}}).\n* Links on disambiguation pages.  See {{section link|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Disambiguation pages|Piping and redirects}} for rationale and exceptions.\n* Radio and TV station call letters, since call letters given up by one station can be used later by a different station.\n* In other namespaces, particularly the template and portal namespaces in which [[WP:Subpages|subpages]] are common, any link or transclusion to a former page title that has become a redirect following a page move is to be updated to the new title for naming consistency.\n\n=== Self-redirects ===\n{{Shortcut|WP:SELFRED}}\n{{See also|Help:Self link}}\n\nAvoid linking to titles that redirect straight back to the page on which the link is found. This situation may arise if a redirect is created from a red link on the page, or if the title was once a separate page but was merged.\n\nHowever, linking to a title that redirects to a section or anchor within the article (redirects with {{Tl|R to section}} or {{Tl|R to anchor}}) is acceptable, as it facilitates navigation in particular on long articles that cannot be viewed all at once on an average-sized computer screen.  In addition to readability benefits, when such redirects are marked with {{Tl|R with possibilities}}, they have the potential to become independent articles in the future. However, consider using [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Linking#Section links|Section links]] instead, when such redirects do not already exist.\n\n==Template redirects== <!-- Wikipedia:AutoWikiBrowser/General fixes links here -->\nA template can be redirected to another template in the same way, e.g., by entering the following markup at the top of a template T2:\n<pre>\n#REDIRECT [[Template:T1]]\n</pre>\nThis allows the template name T2 to be used instead of the actual template name T1. All the parameters of T1 will be respected by T2.\n\nA redirect categorisation ([[Wikipedia:Categorizing redirects|rcat]]) template such as {{Tl|R from move}} may be added to T2 (on the third line below the <code><nowiki>#REDIRECT</nowiki></code> line) as follows:\n<pre>\n#REDIRECT [[Template:T1]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|\n{{R from move}}\n}}\n</pre>\nWhile template shortcut/alias redirects are common, they may infrequently cause confusion and make updating template calls more complicated. For example, if calls to T1 are to be changed to some new template NT1, articles must be searched for {{code|<nowiki>{{T1}}</nowiki>}} and a separate search must also be made for each of its aliases (including T2 in this example). Moreover, changes to syntax, corrections, scans and other processes (for example tag dating) must take into account ''all'' applicable redirects.\n\n== Redirect protection ==\n{{anchor|protection}}{{Shortcut|WP:REDIRECTPROTECTION|WP:RPROTECTION}}\nSometimes, a redirect to an article pertaining to a very controversial topic will be fully or, more rarely, semi-protected indefinitely. This is done when:\n#There is no reason for it to be edited\n#It is frequently expanded into whole articles \n#It is an obvious vandalism target\n#It redirects and/or refers to a very controversial topic\n#Any combination of the above.\n\nRedirects that are fully protected include [[Obama]], [[Hitler]], and [[9/11]]. '''[[WP:SRD|Soft redirects]]''' that are fully protected include obvious vandalism targets like [[dumbass]] and [[fatass]].\n\nRedirects in other namespaces may be protected for technical reasons or are protected under existing guidelines. For example, a template redirect (shorthand) used thousands of times qualifies it as a [[Wikipedia:High-risk template|highly visible template]], eligible for [[WP:TEMP-P|template protection]].\n\n== Category redirects ==\n{{Anchor|CATEGORY|category}}\n\n{{Shortcut|WP:R#CATEGORY}}\n\n{{About|technical issue on category redirects|making \"soft\" category redirects|Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Redirecting categories}}\n\nDo ''not'' create inter-[[Help:Category|category]] redirects, by adding a line <code>#REDIRECT [[<nowiki />:Category:''target category'']]</code> to a category page. Articles added to a \"redirected\" category do not show up in the target category, preventing proper categorization. What's worse, since redirected categories do not become \"red links\", editors won't be aware even when they add an article to a redirected category.\n\nFor an attempt to fix this issue in [[MediaWiki]], see {{Phab|T5311}}.\n\nInstead, [[WP:soft redirect|\"soft\" redirects]] are used. It can be created by placing {{Tlx|Category redirect|target}} in the category page. See [[Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Redirecting categories]].\n\n== Suppressing redirects ==\n{{Anchor|SUPPRESS}}{{Shortcut|WP:R#SUPPRESS}}\n\nWhen a page is moved, a redirect is automatically left behind. Some groups of users (those who possess a <code>suppressredirect</code> [[Special:ListGroupRights|right]]) have the ability to prevent the redirect being created, by unchecking the box labelled \"{{MediaWiki:Move-leave-redirect}}.\" Currently these groups are [[Wikipedia:Administrators|administrators]], [[Wikipedia:Bots|bots]], [[Wikipedia:Page mover|page movers]], and [[meta:Global rollback|global rollbackers]]. In some circumstances, a page should be moved, but a redirect from its current name is inappropriate, such as reverting page-move vandalism. Suppressing the redirect can avoid an extra action (page removal) and save time in these cases.\n\nHowever, in general, the redirect will be a useful entry in the history, and it is best to leave it behind, unless there is a good reason to suppress the redirect, such as vandalism, [[Wikipedia:Userfication|userfying]] ''recently created'' malplaced items or freeing a title to be occupied immediately by another page (e.g., moving <u>term</u> to <u>accurate term</u> and <u>term (disambiguation)</u> to <u>term</u>). Redirects leave a trail to help readers find the old article, in case a new article is created at its previous location, and to prevent [[Wikipedia:Linkrot|linkrot]]. Therefore, we usually neither suppress nor [[#When should we delete a redirect?|delete]] redirects. As Brion Vibber [[phab:T17842#205934|said]], \"Not breaking links helps everyone, ''especially us first and foremost''\". He also [[phab:T17842#205878|said]] that the removal of (file) redirects is \"extremely user-hostile and makes the project less useful\".\n\n== Technical notes ==\nA Wikipedia redirect is not the same as an [[HTTP redirect]] \u2014 it does not generate an [[HTTP 302]] (or other 30''x'') response.  Instead, a page with almost the same content as the target of the redirect is generated by the MediaWiki software, differing in that a small-text note appears below the title of the page, identifying the name of the redirect used to get there (and linking to it in such a way that it can be accessed without the redirect, e.g. so it can be changed).  When a user clicks on a redirect such as [[housecat]], the page URL initially will be https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housecat, but the URL shown by the browser will change to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat after the page loads. \n\nOn one hand, this allows links like [[housecat#Anatomy]] to work as expected, but it also requires redirects to anchors to be implemented as a piece of JavaScript that jumps to an appropriate section after the page has loaded.  For example, [[second-stage boot loader]],  which is rendered as the URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-stage_boot_loader, is a page defined as a #REDIRECT to [[Booting#SECOND-STAGE]].  \"SECOND-STAGE\", in this case, is a manually defined anchor (using the markup \"<nowiki>=== {{anchor|SECOND-STAGE}}Second-stage boot loader ===</nowiki>\") which will persist even if the section is renamed.  However, whether a redirect points to a manually defined anchor, or an anchor defined implicitly via a section name, the behavior will be the same: the page will automatically be scrolled down to the pointed-to anchor only after the page finishes loading (at which point the URL bar will also change to reflect the redirected-to URL, including \"#''anchor''\" portion, rather than the redirected-from URL).\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia glossary}}\n{{Commonscat|MediaWiki redirects}}\n* [[:Category:Redirect templates]]\n* [[:Category:Wikipedia redirects]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Moving a page]]\n* [[Help:Redirect]]\n* [[Special:ListRedirects]]\n* [[Special:BrokenRedirects]]\n* [[Special:DoubleRedirects]]\n* [[Template:Redirect]]\n* [[Template:No redirect]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Articles for creation/Redirects]], to suggest a missing redirect\n* [[Wikipedia:Hatnote]] (see [[Wikipedia:Redirect#What needs to be done on pages that are targets of redirects?|above]])\n* [[Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Soft redirect]]\n* [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Redirect]]\n** [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Redirect/Style guide]]\n* [[Wikipedia:Database reports/Page count by namespace]] and by non-redirects/redirects\n* [[Wikipedia:Deletion by redirection]]\n* [[User:Kephir/gadgets/sagittarius|Sagittarius]], a Wikipedia gadget for redirecting\n\n{{R template index}}\n\n[[Category:Wikipedia editing guidelines]]\n[[Category:Wikipedia redirecting| ]]", "sha1": "qglxhq8g6f3u4wdq9pag1s6q4056i6d"}}, {"title": "Wikipedia:Nupedia and Wikipedia", "ns": "4", "id": "13235", "revision": {"id": "776556776", "parentid": "776556629", "timestamp": "2017-04-21T18:59:47Z", "contributor": {"username": "Casliber", "id": "1381068"}, "comment": "date", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{historical}}\n[[Nupedia]] was a low activity [[open content]], international, peer reviewed [[encyclopedia]] project formerly run by [[Larry Sanger]].

The logo is a graph where nodes represent the Hurd kernel's servers and directed edges are [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] messages.<ref name=\"Koen Vervloesem, 2010\"/>\n\n== Development history ==\n[[Richard Stallman]] founded the [[GNU Project]] in September 1983 with an aim to create a [[Free software|free]] [[GNU]] operating system.  Initially the components required for kernel development were written: [[Text editor|editors]], [[Unix shell|shell]], [[compiler]] and all the others.  By 1989, the [[GNU GPL]] came into being and the only major component missing was the kernel.<ref name=\"Richard Hillesley, 2010\">{{cite web |last=Hillesley |first=Richard |title=GNU HURD: Altered visions and lost promise | date=June 30, 2010 |url=http://www.h-online.com/open/features/GNU-HURD-Altered-visions-and-lost-promise-1030942.html |accessdate=October 1, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"linux-and-gnu\" />\n\nDevelopment on the Hurd began in 1990 after an abandoned kernel attempt in 1986, based on the research [[Trix (operating system)|TRIX]] operating system developed by Professor [[Steve Ward (computer scientist)|Steve Ward]] and his group at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's]] [[Laboratory for Computer Science]] (LCS).<ref name=\"hurd-hist\" /> According to [[Thomas Bushnell]], the initial Hurd architect, their early plan was to adapt the [[4.4BSD]]-Lite kernel and, in hindsight, \"It is now perfectly obvious to me that this would have succeeded splendidly and the world would be a very different place today\".<ref name=\"hurd-and-bsdi\" /> In 1987 Richard Stallman proposed using the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach microkernel]] developed at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]. Work on this was delayed for three years due to uncertainty over whether CMU would release the Mach code under a suitable license.<ref name=\"hurd-hist\" />\n\nWith the release of the [[Linux kernel]] in 1991, the primary user of GNU's [[userland (computing)|userland]] components soon became operating systems based on the Linux kernel ([[Linux distribution]]s), prompting the coining of the term [[GNU/Linux naming controversy|''GNU/Linux'']].\n\nDevelopment of the Hurd has proceeded slowly. Despite an optimistic announcement by Stallman in 2002 predicting a release of GNU/Hurd later that year,<ref name=\"gnu-loose-linux\" /> the Hurd is still not considered suitable for production environments. Development in general has not met expectations, and there are still a significant number of bugs and missing features.<ref name=\"hurd-status\" /> This has resulted in a poorer product than many (including Stallman) had expected.<ref name=\"fsf-future-of-freedom\" /> In 2010, after twenty years under development, Stallman said that he was \"not very optimistic about the GNU Hurd. It makes some progress, but to be really superior it would require solving a lot of deep problems\", but added that \"finishing it is not crucial\" for the GNU system because a free kernel already existed ([[Linux]]), and completing Hurd would not address the main remaining problem for a free operating system: device support.<ref name=\"reddit-interview-stallman\" />\n\nThe [[Debian]] project, among others, have worked on the Hurd project to produce binary distributions of [[Debian GNU/Hurd|Hurd-based GNU operating systems]] for [[IBM PC compatible]] systems.\n\nAfter years of stagnation, development picked up again in 2015 and 2016, with four releases during these two years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://sdtimes.com/free-software-foundation-changes-priorities/|title=Free Software Foundation changes priorities - SD Times|date=2017-01-17|work=SD Times|access-date=2017-04-17|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn August 20, 2015, amid the [[Google Summer of Code]], it was announced that [[GNU Guix]] had been ported to GNU Hurd,<ref name=\"gsoc\">{{cite mailing list|url=https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2015-08/msg00379.html|title=[GSoC update] Porting Guix to GNU/Hurd|date=August 20, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015|first=Manolis|last=Ragkousis|publisher=guix-devel}}</ref> making it the first native package manager on the Hurd.<ref name=\"phoro\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&px=GNU-Hurd-Gets-Guix|title=GNU Guix Package Manager Ported To GNU Hurd|date=August 20, 2015|accessdate=August 20, 2015|publisher=[[Phoronix]]}}</ref>\n\n== Architecture ==\n[[File:OS-structure2.svg|thumb|600px|General structure of monolithic, microkernel and hybrid kernel-based operating systems, respectively.]]\n\nUnlike most [[Unix-like]] kernels, the Hurd uses a [[server\u2013client architecture]], built on a [[microkernel]] that is responsible for providing the most basic [[kernel service]]s &ndash; coordinating access to the [[Computer hardware|hardware]]: the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (through [[process management (computing)|process management]] and [[scheduling (computing)|scheduling]]), [[Random access memory|RAM]] (via [[memory management]]), and other various [[input/output]] devices (via [[I/O scheduling]]) for sound, graphics, mass storage, etc. In theory the microkernel design would allow for all device drivers to be built as servers working in [[user space]], but today most drivers of this kind are still contained in the [[GNU Mach]] [[kernel space]].<ref name=\"device-drivers-in-mach\" />\n\nAccording to Hurd developers, the main advantage of microkernel-based design is the ability to extend the system: developing a new module would not require in depth knowledge of the rest of the kernel, and a bug in one module would not crash the entire system. Hurd provides a concept of ''translators'', a framework of modules used to extend a file system functionality.<ref name=\"Doeppner2010\">{{cite book |last=Doeppner |first=Thomas W. |date=20 December 2010 |title=Operating Systems In Depth: Design and Programming |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-0-471-68723-8 |page=160 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xX5tfrAQQ8cC |accessdate=29 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\nFrom early on, the Hurd was developed to use [[GNU Mach]] as the microkernel. This was a technical decision made by [[Richard Stallman]], who thought it would speed up the work by saving a large part of it. He has admitted that he was wrong about that.<ref name=\"lt-defence-rh\" /> Other Unix-like systems working on the [[Mach kernel|Mach microkernel]] include [[OSF/1]], [[Lites]], and [[MkLinux]]. [[macOS]] and [[NeXTSTEP]] use [[hybrid kernel]]s based on Mach.\n\n=== Other microkernels ===\nFrom 2004 onward, various efforts were launched to port the Hurd to more modern microkernels. The [[L4 microkernel family|L4 microkernel]] was the original choice in 2004, but progress slowed to a halt. Nevertheless, during 2005, Hurd developer Neal Walfield finished the initial memory management framework for the L4/Hurd port, and Marcus Brinkmann ported essential parts of [[glibc]]; namely, getting the process startup code working, allowing programs to run, thus allowing the first user programs (trivial ones such as the [[hello world program]]) in C to run.\n\nSince 2005 Brinkmann and Walfield started researching Coyotos as a new kernel for HURD.<ref name=\"shapiro-comment\" /><ref name=\"l4-and-coyotos-mess\" /> In 2006, Brinkmann met with Jonathan Shapiro (a primary architect of the Coyotos Operating System) to aid in and discuss the use of the Coyotos kernel for GNU/Hurd. In further discussion HURD developers realised that Coyotos (as well as other similar kernels) are not suitable for HURD.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history/port_to_another_microkernel.html | title = Porting the Hurd to another microkernel | access-date = 2017-05-06 | publisher = Free Software Foundation | website = GNU Hurd }}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Hurd developers Neal Walfield and Marcus Brinkmann gave a critique of the Hurd architecture, known as \"the critique\",<ref name=\"critique-mach\" /> and a proposal for how a future system may be designed, known as \"the position paper\".<ref name=\"position-paper\" /> In 2008, Neal Walfield began working on the Viengoos microkernel as a modern native kernel for HURD. {{as of|2009}}, development on Viengoos is paused due to Walfield lacking time to work on it.<ref name=\"viengoos\" />\n\nIn the meantime, others have continued working on the Mach variant of Hurd.<ref name=\"what-happend-l4-coyotos\" />\n\n=== Unix extensions ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2007}}\n\nA number of traditional Unix concepts are replaced or extended in the Hurd.\n\nUnder Unix, every running program has an associated [[user id]], which normally corresponds to the user that started the [[process (computing)|process]]. This id largely dictates the actions permitted to the program. No outside process can change the user id of a running program. A Hurd process, on the other hand, runs under a ''set'' of user ids, which can contain multiple ids, one, or none. A sufficiently privileged process can add and remove ids to another process. For example, there is a password server that will hand out ids in return for a correct login password.\n\nRegarding the [[file system]], a suitable program can be designated as a ''translator'' for a single file or a whole directory hierarchy. Every access to the translated file, or files below a hierarchy in the second case, is in fact handled by the program. For example, a file translator may simply redirect read and write operations to another file, like a Unix [[symbolic link]]. The effect of Unix ''[[mount (computing)|mounting]]'' is achieved by setting up a filesystem translator (using the \"settrans\" command). Translators can also be used to provide services to the user. For example, the [[ftpfs]] translator allows a user to encapsulate remote FTP sites within a directory. Then, standard tools such as [[ls]], [[cp (Unix)|cp]], and [[rm (Unix)|rm]] can be used to manipulate files on the remote system. Even more powerful translators are ones such as [[UnionFS]], which allows a user to unify multiple directories into one; thus listing the unified directory reveals the contents of all the directories.\n\nThe Hurd requires a [[Multiboot Specification|multiboot]]-compliant [[booting|boot loader]], such as [[GNU GRUB|GRUB]].\n\n=== Architecture of the servers ===\nAccording to the Debian documentation, there are 24 servers (18 core servers and 6 file system servers) named as follows:<ref name=\"debian-hurd-doc\" />\n\n==== Core servers ====\n* '''auth''' ([[authentication server]]): Receives requests and passwords from programs and gives them an ID, which changes the privileges of the program.\n* '''crash''' ([[Crash (computing)|crash]] server): Handles all fatal errors.\n* '''exec''' (execution server): Translates an executable image (currently [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] and [[a.out]] are supported) to a runnable image in memory.\n* '''fifo''' ([[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO]] translator): Implements named pipes.\n* '''new-fifo''' (new FIFO server): An alternate server for named pipes.\n* '''firmlink''' (the firmlink translator): Implements firmlinks \u2012 \"half-way between a [[symbolic link]] and a [[hard link]]\".<ref>{{cite web |date=1996-10-10 |title=GNU/Hurd - Documentation |publisher=Debian |url=http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-doc-server#firmlink |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>\n* '''fwd''' (forward server): Forwards requests to other servers, used by fifo and symlink servers.\n* '''hostmux''' (host multiplexer server)\n* '''ifsock''' (server for sockets interface): Helps with UNIX domain socket addresses.\n* '''init''' ([[init]] server): Basic system booting and configuration.\n* '''magic''' ([[Magic (programming)|magic]] server): Signals that a name lookup must be resolved internally by a process when the result involves the process's state.\n* '''null''' (null server): Implements [[/dev/null]] and /dev/zero.\n* '''pfinet''' (pfinet server): Implements the PF_INET protocol family.\n* '''pflocal''' (pflocal server): Implements [[UNIX domain sockets]].\n* '''proc''' (process server): Assigns [[Process identifier|PID]]s and manages process-level actions.\n* '''symlink''' ([[symbolic link]] translator): Implements symbolic links for filesystems that don't support them.\n* '''term''' (terminal server): A [[POSIX]] terminal.\n* '''usermux''' (user multiplexer server): Invokes user-specific translators.\n\n==== Filesystem servers ====\n;ext2fs\n:The [[ext2]] filesystem translator. It receives disk blocks from the microkernel and gives files and directories to the applications.\n;isofs\n:The translator for the [[ISO 9660]] filesystem. Translates blocks of a CD or DVD to files and directories for the applications.\n;nfs\n:See [[Network File System (protocol)|Network File System]].\n;ufs\n:Translator for the BSD filesystem of the same name, [[Unix File System|UFS]].\n;ftpfs\n: [[File transfer protocol]] filesystem translator.\n;storeio\n:The storage translator.\n\nThe servers collectively implement the [[POSIX]] [[Applications programming interface|API]], with each server implementing a part of the interface. For instance, the various filesystem servers each implement the filesystem calls. The storage server will work as a wrapping layer, similar to the block layer of Linux. The equivalent of [[Virtual file system|VFS]] of [[Linux]] is achieved by libdiskfs and libpager libraries.\n\n==GNU distributions running Hurd ==\n[[File:Gnu hurd debian 1.png|thumbnail|[[Debian GNU/Hurd]] with [[Xfce4]] and web browser [[Midori (web browser)|Midori]]]]\n\nHurd-based [[GNU]] distributions include:\n* [[Arch Hurd]]\n* Bee GNU/Hurd (discontinued)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/distrib.html |title= GNU Hurd/ hurd/ running/ distrib |website=www.gnu.org |date=2015-05-03 |access-date=2017-09-21}}</ref>\n* [[Debian GNU/Hurd]]\n* [[Gentoo/Alt#Gentoo GNU Hurd|Gentoo GNU Hurd]] (discontinued)\n* GNU/Hurd Live CD<ref name=\"Live CD\">{{cite web |title=GNU Hurd/ hurd/ running/ live cd |website=www.gnu.org |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/live_cd.html |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2017-09-21}}</ref> (discontinued){{not in citation|date=September 2017}}\n* [[Guix System Distribution]] (under development)\n* [[NixOS]] - experiment<ref>{{cite web |date=2012-03-21 |title=Nix-based GNU/Hurd System |publisher=Gnu.org |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/running/nix.html |accessdate=2012-07-12}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Free software}}\n\n* [[GNU Mach]]\n* [[GNU Linux-libre]] \u2013 the [[Free software|free]] version of the [[Linux kernel]]\n* [[Kernel-based Virtual Machine]] (KVM)\n* [[Minix 3]]\n* [[Multiboot Specification]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em|refs=\n<ref name=\"What Is the GNU Hurd\">{{cite web |title=What Is the GNU Hurd? |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/what_is_the_gnu_hurd.html |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"advantages\">{{cite web |title=advantages |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/advantages.html |accessdate=2011-12-07}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hurd-name\">{{cite web |title=GNU Hurd: Origin of the Name |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/what_is_the_gnu_hurd/origin_of_the_name.html |accessdate=2010-03-04}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"linux-and-gnu\">{{cite web |date=2010-01-26 |title=Linux and the GNU Project |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html |accessdate=2010-03-04 }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hurd-hist\">{{cite web |title=The GNU Hurd History, 'How it Started' |work=[[GNU]] |url=https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/history.html |accessdate=2006-08-27}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"hurd-and-bsdi\">{{cite web |last=Salus |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter H.

In 2007, the United States spent $7,290 per capita on health care. The average among peer nations in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) is $3075, just 42 percent of U.S. spending. Health spending is concentrated on a few consumers. In 2006, almost half of all health care spending was used to treat just 5 percent of the population, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. More than half of bankruptcy filings are related to health care expenses, and sixty-eight percent of these cases are filed by people who have health insurance. According to the White House Council of Economic Advisors, the average family income will be $2,600 lower by 2020, if the growth in the cost of health care is not slowed by at least 1.5 percent. The cost of health insurance premiums more than doubled between 1999 and 2008 while workers' earnings stagnated. In 2008, the average annual cost for family insurance coverage was $12,700.\n\nEven though the United States spends more on health care than any other country in the world, in 2015 the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that about 38.2% of adults in the United States are obese. The obesity rates among American adults is almost triple of any other country on the top ten list of countries spending the most money on health care in the world. The United States is also the only country in the top 10 of health care spending with an average lifespan under 80 years of age. The incredibly high health care expenditures in the United States results from a combination of various factors; medical practitioner salaries, expensive medical procedures, hospital costs, and most of all pharmaceutical products. Drug manufacturers in the United States set their own prices, while also allowing \"government-protected monopolies\" for certain drug manufacturers by granting sole drug manufacturers patents for 20 years or more.\n\nAn estimated 52 million people \u2013 more than 15 percent of the people in the United States \u2013 are currently{{when?|date=March 2017}} without health insurance or access to a government health care program. Nationally, 77 percent of the people who are uninsured are workers or are dependents of someone who works. In 2008, employees of small businesses contributed an average of $4,101 for family coverage, compared to $2,982 paid by employees in large firms. About 59 percent of employees with incomes below the poverty level ($18,310 for a family of three)  do not have health insurance. At income levels twice to three times the poverty level, about 34 percent lack insurance. Half as many lack insurance at four times the poverty level.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Off Campus Database Authentication|url = http://search.proquest.com/altpresswatch/docview/196316990/fulltext/DDD9FAFC315743F8PQ/4?accountid=5683|website = search.proquest.com|accessdate = 2015-09-25}}</ref>\n\n==United Kingdom==\n{{Further information|Healthcare in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Update|inaccurate=yes|date=January 2012}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2009}}\nHealthcare was reformed in 1948 after the Second World War, broadly along the lines of the 1942 [[Beveridge Report]], with the creation of the [[National Health Service]] or NHS. It was originally established as part of a wider reform of [[social services]] and funded by a system of [[National Insurance]], though receipt of healthcare was never contingent upon making contributions towards the [[National Insurance Fund]].  Private health care was not abolished but had to compete with the NHS. About 15% of all spending on health in the UK is still privately funded but this includes the patient contributions towards NHS provided prescription drugs, so private sector healthcare in the UK is quite small. As part of a wider reform of social provision it was originally thought that the focus would be as much about the prevention of ill-health as it was about curing disease. The NHS for example would distribute baby formula milk fortified with vitamins and minerals in an effort to improve the health of children born in the post war years as well as other supplements such as cod liver oil and malt. Many of the common childhood diseases such as measles, mumps, and chicken pox were mostly eradicated with a national program of [[vaccination]]s.\n\nThe NHS has been through many reforms since 1974. The Conservative [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] administrations attempted to bring competition into the NHS by developing a supplier/buyer role between hospitals as suppliers and health authorities as buyers. This necessitated the detailed costing of activities, something which the NHS had never had to do in such detail, and some felt was unnecessary. The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] generally opposed these changes, although after the party became [[New Labour]], the [[Tony Blair|Blair government]] retained elements of competition and even extended it, allowing private health care providers to bid for NHS work. Some treatment and diagnostic centres are now run by private enterprise and funded under contract. However, the extent of this privatisation of NHS work is still small, though remains controversial. The administration committed more money to the NHS raising it to almost the same level of funding as the European average and as a result, there was large expansion and modernisation programme and waiting times improved.\n\nThe government of [[Gordon Brown]] proposed new reforms for care in England. One is to take the NHS back more towards health prevention by tackling issues that are known to cause long term ill health. The biggest of these is obesity and related diseases such as diabetes and cardio-vascular disease. The second reform is to make the NHS a more personal service, and it is negotiating with doctors to provide more services at times more convenient to the patient, such as in the evenings and at weekends. This personal service idea would introduce regular health check-ups so that the population is screened more regularly. Doctors will give more advice on ill-health prevention (for example encouraging and assisting patients to control their weight, diet, exercise more, cease smoking etc.) and so tackle problems before they become more serious. Waiting times, which fell considerably under Blair (median wait time is about 6 weeks for elective non-urgent surgery) are also in focus. A target was set from December 2008, to ensure that no person waits longer than 18 weeks from the date that a patient is referred to the hospital to the time of the operation or treatment. This 18-week period thus includes the time to arrange a first appointment, the time for any investigations or tests to determine the cause of the problem and how it should be treated. An [[NHS Constitution]] was published which lays out the legal rights of patients as well as promises (not legally enforceable) the NHS strives to keep in England.\n\n==Germany==\nNumerous healthcare reforms in Germany were legislative interventions to stabilise the public health insurance since 1983. 9 out of 10 citizens are publicly insured, only 8% privately. [[Health care in Germany]], including its industry and all services, is one of the largest sectors of the [[German economy]]. The total expenditure in [[Health economics (Germany)|health economics of Germany]] was about 287.3 billion euro in 2010, equivalent to 11.6 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) this year and about 3,510 euro per capita. Direct inpatient and outpatient care equal just about a quarter of the entire expenditure - depending on the perspective.<ref>[[:de:Andreas Goldschmidt|Andreas J. W.

In comparison to the UK, physicians in Germany have more bargaining power through professional organizations (i.e., physician associations); this ability to negotiate affects reform efforts.<ref>Freeman, Richard. The Politics of Health in Europe. 1999 (Manchester: Manchester University Press)</ref> Germany makes use of sickness funds, which citizens are obliged to join but are able to opt out if they have a very high income (Belien 87).  The Netherlands used a similar system but the financial threshold for opting out was lower (Belien 89). The Swiss, on the other hand use more of a privately based health insurance system where citizens are risk-rated by age and sex, among other factors (Belien 90). The United States government provides healthcare to just over 25% of its citizens through various agencies, but otherwise does not employ a system. Healthcare is generally centered around regulated private insurance methods.\n\nOne key component to healthcare reform is the reduction of healthcare fraud and abuse. In the U.S. and the EU, it is estimated that as much as 10 percent of all healthcare transactions and expenditures may be fraudulent. See Terry L. Leap, ''Phantom Billing, Fake Prescriptions, and the High Cost of Medicine: Health Care Fraud and What to do about It'' (Cornell University Press, 2011).\n\nAlso interesting to notice is the oldest healthcare system in the world and its advantages and disadvantages, see [[Health in Germany]].\n\n== \"Control knobs\" theory ==\n[[File:Five knobs figure.png|thumb|''The five control knobs for health-sector reform'']]\nIn ''\u201cGetting Health Reform Right: A Guide to Improving Performance and Equity,\u201d''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Getting health reform right: a guide to improving performance and equity|last1=Roberts |first1=Marc |last2=Hsiao |first2=William |last3=Berman |first3=Peter |last4=Reich |first4=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Marc Roberts, [[William Hsiao]], Peter Berman, and Michael Reich of the [[Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health]] aim to provide decision-makers with tools and frameworks for health care system reform. They propose five \u201ccontrol knobs\u201d of health reform: financing, payment, organization, regulation, and behavior<ref name=\":0\" />. These control knobs refer to the \u201cmechanisms and processes that reformers can adjust to improve system performance\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />. The authors selected these control knobs as representative of the most important factors upon which a policymaker can act to determine health system outcomes. \n\nTheir method emphasizes the importance of \u201cidentifying goals explicitly, diagnosing causes of poor performance systematically, and devising reforms that will produce real changes in performance\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />. The authors view health care systems as a means to an end. Accordingly, the authors advocate for three intrinsic performance goals of the health system that can be adjusted through the control knobs. These goals include: \n# ''Health status:'' This goal refers to the overall health of the target population, assessed by metrics such as life expectancy, disease burden, and/or the distribution of these across population subgroups.\n# ''Customer satisfaction:'' This goal is concerned with the degree of satisfaction that the health care system produces among the target population.\n# ''Financial risk protection:'' This goal refers to the health system\u2019s ability to protect the target population from the financial burden of poor health or disease.\nThe authors also propose three intermediate performance measures, which are useful in determining the performance of system goals, but are not final objectives<ref name=\":0\" />. These include:\n# ''Efficiency:''\n## Technical efficiency: maximum output per unit cost\n## Allocative efficiency: a given budget maximises health system user satisfaction or other defined goals\n# ''Access:'' effective availability by which patients receive care\n# ''Quality of care:'' consideration of both the average quality and distribution of quality\nWhile final performance goals are largely agreed upon, other frameworks suggest alternative intermediate goals to those mentioned here, such as equity, productivity, safety, innovation, and choice<ref>{{Cite book|title=Health System Performance Comparison: An Agenda For Policy, Information And Research: An agenda for policy, information and research|last1=Papanicolas|first1=Irene|last2=Smith|first2=Peter|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education (UK)|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+''Alternative frameworks for health care reform''\n|'''Framework'''\n|'''Intermediate Goals'''\n|-\n|Control knobs framework\n|Efficiency\n\nAccess\n\nQuality\n|-\n|Framework for assessing behavioural healthcare\n|Effectiveness\n\nEfficiency\n\nEquity\n|-\n|EGIPSS model\n|Productivity\n\nVolume of care and services\n\nQuality of care and services\n|-\n|WHO Performance framework\n|Access\n\nCoverage\n\nQuality\n\nSafety\n|-\n|Commonwealth Fund framework\n|High-quality care\n\nEfficient care\n\nAccess\n\nSystem and workforce innovation and improvement\n|-\n|WHO Building Blocks Framework\n|Access\n\nCoverage\n\nQuality\n\nSafety\n|-\n|Systems Thinking\n|Equity\n\nChoice\n\nEfficiency\n\nEffectiveness\n|}\nThe five proposed control knobs represent the mechanisms and processes that policy-makers can use to design effective health care reforms. These control knobs are not only the most important elements of a healthcare system, but they also represent the aspect that can be deliberately adjusted by reforms to affect change. The five control knobs are<ref name=\":0\" />:\n# '''''Financing''''', which encompasses all the mechanisms and activities designed to raise money for the health system. With respect to mechanisms, the financing knob includes health-related taxes, insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses among others. Activities refers to the institutional organization that collects and distributes finance to participants in the health sector. In other words, financing is about the resources available to the healthcare system, who controls them and who receives them. The financing knob has clear implications for the health status of the population and particular groups in it, as well as the access to health care and protection from financial risk that these groups, and the population as a whole, have. The financing knob involves numerous potential financing mechanisms and processes that should be selected in accordance with a country\u2019s social values and politics. \n# '''''Payment''''' refers to the mechanisms and processes through which the health system or patients distribute payments to providers, including fees, capitation and budgets on the part of the government and fees paid by patients. Payment is about the distribution of available resources to the providers of health services. Health care reform can implement a variety of incentive schemes for both providers and patients in a way to optimize limited resources. \n# '''''Organization''''' of the health system refers to the structure of providers, their roles, activities and operations. Essentially, organization describes how the health care market is set up: who are the providers, who are the consumers, who are the competitors, and who runs them. Changes in the organization of a healthcare system happen at multiple levels at both the front-line and managerial level. \n# '''''Regulation''''' refers to actions at the state level that modify or alter the behavior of various actors within the health care system. The actors may include health care providers, medical associations, individual consumers, insurance agents, and more. Regulations are only effective when enforced, therefore laws that are \u201con the books\u201d but are not implemented in practice have little effect on the system as a whole.\n# '''''Behavior''''' of healthcare actors includes actions of both providers (e.g., doctors\u2019 behavior) and patients (e.g., anti-smoking campaigns) and involves \u201cchanging individual behavior through population-based interventions\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />. Healthcare reform with respect to behavior revolves around the behaviors that can be used to improve the outcomes and performance of the health care system. These behaviors include health-seeking behavior, professional/doctors\u2019 behavior, treatment compliance, and lifestyle and prevention behaviors. \nThe five control knobs of health care reform are not designed to work in isolation; health care reform may require the adjustment of more than one knob or of multiple knobs simultaneously. Further, there is no agreed-upon order of turning control knobs to achieve specific reforms or outcomes. Health care reform varies by setting and reforms from one context may not necessarily apply in another. It is important to note that the knobs interact with cultural and structural factors that are not illustrated within this framework, but which have an important effect on health care reform in a given context. \n\nIn summary, the authors of ''\u201cGetting Health Reform Right: A Guide to Improving Performance and Equity\u201d''<ref name=\":0\" /> propose a framework for assessing health systems that guides decision-makers\u2019 understanding of the reform process. Rather than a prescriptive proposal of recommendations, the framework allows users to adapt their analysis and actions based on cultural context and relevance of interventions. As noted above, many frameworks for health care reform exist in the literature. Using a comprehensive yet responsive approach such as the control knobs framework proposed by Roberts, Hsiao, Berman, and Reich allows decision-makers to more precisely determine the \u201cmechanisms and processes\u201d that can be changed in order to achieve improved health status, customer satisfaction, and financial risk protection.\n\n==See also==\n\n===Topics on status quo in health care===\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Health care]] / [[Healthcare system]] / [[Health care provider]]\n* [[Health center]] / [[Clinic]] / [[Hospital]]\n* [[Health care politics]]\n* [[Medical education]]\n* [[Medicine]] / [[Doctor's visit]] / [[Nursing]]\n* [[Philosophy of healthcare]] / [[Universal health care]]\n** [[Social service]] / [[Social determinants of health]]\n** [[Family medicine]] / [[Preventive medicine]] / [[Social medicine]]\n* [[Health policy]]\n** [[Health insurance]] / [[Insurance]] /[[Social health insurance]]\n** [[Community health service]] / [[Direct primary care]]\n** [[Direct primary care]] / [[School health services]]\n** [[Family medicine]] / [[Preventive medicine]] / [[Social medicine]]\n** [[Military medicine]]\n** [[Occupational safety and health]]\n** [[Unnecessary health care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Reform===\n<!-- Please maintain in alphabetical order -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Health care compared]] - tabular comparisons of the US, Canada, and other countries not shown above.\n* [[Health care in the United States]]\n* [[Health care reform in the United States]]\n* [[Healthcare-NOW!]]\n* [[Health-care reform in China]]\n* [[History of the National Health Service]] - and related national sub-pages such as [[History of the National Health Service (England)]]\n* [[Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved]]\n* [[Kaiser Family Foundation]]\n* [[List of healthcare reform advocacy groups in the United States]]\n* [[Massachusetts health care reform]]\n* [[Matthew effect]]: sociological disparity of coverage\n* [[Medicare Rights Center]]\n* [[National health insurance]]\n* [[National Physicians Alliance]]\n* [[Progressive Democrats of America]]\n* [[Puerto Rico Health Reform]]\n* [[ShoutAmerica]]\n* [[Single-payer health care]]\n* [[United States National Health Care Act]]\n* [[Universal Health Care Foundation of Connecticut]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n<!-- Country-related links belong in that country's article, not here -->\n<!-- Please maintain in alphabetical order -->\n* [http://www.euro.who.int/observatory European Observatory on Health Systems & Policy] at the [[World Health Organization]]\n* [http://www.hpm.org/index.jsp International Network of Health Policy and Reform]\n* [http://www.pnhp.org/single_payer_resources/international_resources.php International Resources] from [[Physicians for a National Health Program]]\n* [http://www.towerswatson.com/health-care-reform Health Care Reform: FAQs and Implications for Employers] from [[Towers Watson]]\n\n{{Health care}}\n{{Public health}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Healthcare Reform}}\n[[Category:Healthcare reform| ]]\n[[Category:Health promotion]]", "sha1": "t94t7843irtx150z4j6s6i8wedzj8w1"}}, {"title": "Horse-breaking", "ns": "0", "id": "13251", "redirect": {"title": "Horse training"}, "revision": {"id": "346286503", "parentid": "320326534", "timestamp": "2010-02-25T13:08:19Z", "contributor": {"username": "Graham87", "id": "194203"}, "minor": "", "comment": "1 revision from [[:nost:Horse-breaking]]: import old edit, see [[User:Graham87/Import]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[Horse training]]", "sha1": "hgzflyyqjoipxjgu4imv07obqcwyxit"}}, {"title": "Henry Mayhew", "ns": "0", "id": "13253", "revision": {"id": "866495626", "parentid": "852954958", "timestamp": "2018-10-30T17:58:45Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "id": "753665"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Removing from [[Category:British male journalists]] (parent category) using [[c:Help:Cat-a-lot|Cat-a-lot]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{EngvarB|date=April 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2015}}\n[[Image:Henrymayhew.png|thumb|Henry Mayhew, from ''London Labour and the London Poor'' (1861)]]\n\n'''Henry Mayhew''' (25 November 1812 \u2013 25 July 1887) was an English social researcher, journalist, playwright and advocate of reform. He was one of the co-founders of the satirical and humorous magazine ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1841, and was the magazine's joint-editor, with [[Mark Lemon]], in its early days. He is also known for his work as a social researcher, publishing an extensive series of newspaper articles in the ''[[Morning Chronicle]]'' that was later compiled into the book series ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]'' (1851), a groundbreaking and influential survey of the city's poor.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nHe was born in London, one of seventeen children of Joshua Mayhew. He was educated at [[Westminster School]] before running away from his studies to sea.<ref>Taithe (1996), p.3</ref> He then served with the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] as a [[midshipman]] on a ship bound for [[Kolkata|Calcutta]]. He returned after several years, in 1829, becoming a trainee lawyer in [[Wales]].<ref name = \"puuvpx\">Taithe (1996), p.9</ref> He left this and became a freelance journalist. He contributed to ''The Thief'', a readers' digest, followed quickly by editing a weekly journal&nbsp;\u2013 ''Figaro in London''. Mayhew reputedly fled his creditors and holed up at The Erwood Inn, a small public house in the village of [[Erwood]], south of [[Builth Wells]] in Wales.\n\n===Paris and writing===\nIn 1835 Mayhew found himself in a state of debt and, along with a fellow writer, escaped to Paris to avoid his creditors.<ref name = \"puuvpx\"/> He spent his time writing and in the company of other writers including [[William Thackeray]] and [[Douglas Jerrold]]. Mayhew spent over ten years in Paris returning to England in the 1850s whereby he was involved in several literary adventures, mostly the writing of plays. Two of his plays&nbsp;\u2013 ''But, However'' and the ''Wandering Minstrel''&nbsp;\u2013 were successful, whilst his early work ''Figaro in London'' was less successful.<ref name = \"gxjpjs\">Taithe (1996), p.10</ref>\n\n===''Punch'' magazine===\n[[Image:Punch.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]] was co founded by Mayhew in 1841.]]\nOn 17 July 1841 Mayhew cofounded [[Punch (magazine)|Punch magazine]]. At its founding the magazine was jointly edited by Mayhew and [[Mark Lemon]]. The two men hired a group of writers and also illustrators to aid them. These included Douglas Jerrold, Angus Reach, John Leech, Richard Doyle and Shirley Brooks. Initially it was subtitled ''The London Charivari'', this being a reference to a satirical humour magazine published in France under the title ''[[Le Charivari]]'' (a work read often whilst Mayhew was in Paris).  Reflecting their satiric and humorous intent, the two editors took for their name and masthead the anarchic glove [[puppet]] [[Punch and Judy|Mr. Punch]].\n\n''Punch'' was an unexpected success, selling about 6,000 copies a week in the early years. However, sales of as many as 10,000 issues a week were required to cover all costs of the magazine. In December 1842, the magazine was sold to Bradbury and Evans; Mayhew resigned as joint editor,<ref name = \"gxjpjs\"/> and he continued at the magazine as \"suggestor in chief\" with Mark Lemon reappointed as editor. Mayhew eventually severed his connection with the magazine, writing his last article in February 1845. His brother Horace stayed on the board of Punch until his own death.\n\nThe ''Punch'' years gave Mayhew the opportunity to meet talented illustrators who he later employed to work from [[daguerreotypes]] on ''[[London Labour and the London Poor]]''.<ref name = \"gxjpjs\"/> Following ''Punch'' magazine, Mayhew new launched ''Iron Times'', a railway magazine. However this venture lost Mayhew so much money that he was forced to appear in a Court of [[Bankruptcy]] in 1846.\n\n===Formative work===\nIn 1842 Mayhew contributed to the pioneering [[Illustrated London News]]. By this time Mayhew had become reasonably secure financially, had settled his debts and married Jane Jerrold, the daughter of his friend [[Douglas Jerrold]].<ref>Taithe (1996), p.11</ref> She lived until 1880.\n\n====''London Labour and the London Poor''====\n{{Main article|London Labour and the London Poor}}\nThe articles comprising ''London Labour and the London Poor'' were initially collected into three volumes in 1851; the 1861 edition included a fourth volume, co-written with Bracebridge Hemyng, John Binny and [[Andrew Halliday (journalist)|Andrew Halliday]], on the lives of prostitutes, thieves and beggars. This Extra Volume took a more general and statistical approach to its subject than Volumes 1 to 3.\n\nMayhew wrote in volume one: \"''I shall consider the whole of the metropolitan poor under three separate phases, according as they ''will'' work, they ''can't'' work, and they ''won't'' work''\".<ref>http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0140  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050322222303/http://nils.lib.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A4000.01.0140 |date=22 March 2005 }}</ref> He interviewed everyone\u2014beggars, street-entertainers (such as [[Punch and Judy]] men), market traders, prostitutes, labourers, [[sweatshop]] workers, even down to the \"[[mudlark]]s\" who searched the stinking mud on the banks of the [[River Thames]] for wood, metal, rope and coal from passing ships, and the \"pure-finders\" who gathered dog faeces to sell to [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]s. He described their clothes, how and where they lived, their entertainments and customs, and made detailed estimates of the numbers and incomes of those practising each trade. The books show how marginal and precarious many people's lives were, in what, at that time, was the richest city in the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\nMayhew's richly detailed descriptions give an impression of what the street markets of his day were like. An example from Volume 1:\n:'The pavement and the road are crowded with purchasers and street-sellers. The housewife in her thick shawl, with the market-basket on her arm, walks slowly on, stopping now to look at the stall of caps, and now to cheapen a bunch of greens. Little boys, holding three or four onions in their hand, creep between the people, wriggling their way through every interstice, and asking for custom in whining tones, as if seeking charity. Then the tumult of the thousand different cries of the eager dealers, all shouting at the top of their voices, at one and the same time, is almost bewildering. \"So-old again,\" roars one. \"Chestnuts all'ot, a penny a score,\" bawls another. \"An 'aypenny a skin, blacking,\" squeaks a boy. \"Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy-- bu-u-uy!\" cries the butcher. \"[[Paper quire#Quire|Half-quire]] of paper for a penny,\" bellows the street stationer. \"An 'aypenny a lot ing-uns.\" \u201cTwopence a pound grapes.\" \u201cThree a penny Yarmouth bloaters.\" \u201cWho'll buy a bonnet for fourpence?\" \u201cPick 'em out cheap here! three pair for a halfpenny, bootlaces.\" \u201cNow's your time! beautiful whelks, a penny a lot.\" \u201cHere's ha'p\u2018orths,\" shouts the perambulating confectioner. \"Come and look at 'em! here's toasters!\" bellows one with a Yarmouth bloater stuck on a toasting-fork. \"Penny a lot, fine russets,\" calls the apple woman: and so the Babel goes on.'<ref>Mayhew, Henry 1851\u20131861.

In spring/summer 1851 they established a ''Street Trader's Protection Association'' to guard themselves against the journalist.<ref>M\u00fcnch (2017)</ref>\n\n==Family==\nMayhew was the grandfather of Audrey Mayhew Allen (b. 1870), an author of a number of children's stories published in various periodicals, and of ''[[Gladys in Grammarland]]'', an [[Works based on Alice in Wonderland|imitation]] of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''Wonderland'' books.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jerrold|first1=Yvonne|title=Family Tree|url=http://www.yvonnejerrold.com/FamilyTree/1-JaneMatilda%282%29Jerrold-Mayhews.html|website=Yvonne Jerrold}}</ref>\n\n==Influence==\nMayhew's work was embraced by and was an influence on the [[Christian Socialists]], such as [[Thomas Hughes]], [[Charles Kingsley]], and [[F. D. Maurice]]. Radicals also published sizeable excerpts from the reports in the [[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]], the [[Red Republican]], and other newspapers. The often sympathetic investigations, with their immediacy and unswerving eye for detail, offered unprecedented insights into the condition of the Victorian poor. Alongside the earlier work of [[Edwin Chadwick]], they are also regarded as a decisive influence on the thinking of [[Charles Dickens]].\n\nMayhew's work inspired the script of director [[Christine Edzard]]'s 1990 film ''[[The Fool (1990 film)|The Fool]]''.

That is why {{chem|H|+}} is often called a proton. This species is central to discussion of [[acid]]s. Under the [[Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory]], acids are proton donors, while bases are proton acceptors.\n\nA bare proton, {{chem|H|+}}, cannot exist in solution or in ionic crystals because of its unstoppable attraction to other atoms or molecules with electrons. Except at the high temperatures associated with plasmas, such protons cannot be removed from the [[electron cloud]]s of atoms and molecules, and will remain attached to them. However, the term 'proton' is sometimes used loosely and metaphorically to refer to positively charged or [[cation]]ic hydrogen attached to other species in this fashion, and as such is denoted \"{{chem|H|+}}\" without any implication that any single protons exist freely as a species.\n\nTo avoid the implication of the naked \"solvated proton\" in solution, acidic aqueous solutions are sometimes considered to contain a less unlikely fictitious species, termed the \"[[hydronium]] ion\" ({{chem|H|3|O|+}}). However, even in this case, such solvated hydrogen cations are more realistically conceived as being organized into clusters that form species closer to H{{su|b=9}}{{chem|O|4|+}}.<ref name=\"Okumura\">{{cite journal\n|last=Okumura|first=A.

Janssen recorded the helium spectral line during the solar eclipse of 1868 while Lockyer observed it from Britain. Lockyer was the first to propose that the line was due to a new element, which he named. The formal [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovery of the element]] was made in 1895 by two [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemists, [[Per Teodor Cleve]] and [[Nils Abraham Langlet]], who found helium emanating from the [[uranium]] [[ore]] [[cleveite]]. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in [[natural gas field]]s in parts of the United States, which is by far the largest supplier of the gas today.\n\nLiquid helium is used in [[Helium cryogenics|cryogenics]] (its largest single use, absorbing about a quarter of production), particularly in the cooling of [[superconducting magnet]]s, with the main commercial application being in [[MRI]] scanners. Helium's other industrial uses\u2014as a pressurizing and purge gas, as a protective atmosphere for [[arc welding]] and in processes such as growing crystals to make [[silicon wafer]]s\u2014account for half of the gas produced. A well-known but minor use is as a [[lifting gas]] in [[balloon]]s and [[airship]]s.<ref>{{cite website |url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=35225 |title=Helium: Up, Up and Away? |first=Melinda |last=Rose |website=Photonics Spectra |date=October 2008 |access-date=February 27, 2010}} For a more authoritative but older 1996 pie chart showing U.S. helium use by sector, showing much the same result, see the chart reproduced in \"Applications\" section of this article.</ref> As with any gas whose density differs from that of air, inhaling a small volume of helium temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the [[human voice]].

Depicted are the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (pink) and the [[electron cloud]] distribution (black). The nucleus (upper right) in helium-4 is in reality spherically symmetric and closely resembles the electron cloud, although for more complicated nuclei this is not always the case.]]\n\n====Helium in quantum mechanics====\nIn the perspective of [[quantum mechanics]], helium is the second simplest [[atom]] to model, following the [[hydrogen atom]]. Helium is composed of two electrons in [[atomic orbital]]s surrounding a nucleus containing two protons and (usually) two neutrons. As in Newtonian mechanics, no system that consists of more than two particles can be solved with an exact analytical mathematical approach (see [[3-body problem]]) and helium is no exception. Thus, numerical mathematical methods are required, even to solve the system of one nucleus and two electrons. Such [[computational chemistry]] methods have been used to create a quantum mechanical picture of helium electron binding which is accurate to within < 2% of the correct value, in a few computational steps.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/helium.htm|last=Watkins|first=Thayer|publisher=San Jose State University|title=The Old Quantum Physics of Niels Bohr and the Spectrum of Helium: A Modified Version of the Bohr Model}}</ref> Such models show that each electron in helium partly screens the nucleus from the other, so that the effective nuclear charge ''Z'' which each electron sees, is about 1.69 units, not the 2 charges of a classic \"bare\" helium nucleus.\n\n====The related stability of the helium-4 nucleus and electron shell====\nThe nucleus of the helium-4 atom is identical with an [[alpha particle]]. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own [[electron cloud]]. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different nuclear binding potential), so that all these [[fermion]]s fully occupy [[1s1s|1s]] orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another of any of these particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.\n\nFor example, the stability and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium accounts for the element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.\n\nIn a similar way, the particular energetic stability of the helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, accounts for the ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (2 protons and 1 neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, but it is a very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.\n\n[[File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg|thumb|right|Binding energy per nucleon of common isotopes. The binding energy per particle of helium-4 is significantly larger than all nearby nuclides.]]\nThe unusual stability of the helium-4 nucleus is also important [[Cosmology|cosmologically]]: it explains the fact that in the first few minutes after the [[Big Bang]], as the \"soup\" of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that nuclear binding was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 nuclear binding per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see [[nucleogenesis]] and [[binding energy]]) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per [[nucleon]], carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see [[triple alpha process]]). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.\n\nAll heavier elements (including those necessary for rocky planets like the Earth, and for carbon-based or other life) have thus been created since the Big Bang in stars which were hot enough to fuse helium itself. All elements other than hydrogen and helium today account for only 2% of the mass of atomic matter in the universe. Helium-4, by contrast, makes up about 23% of the universe's ordinary matter\u2014nearly all the ordinary matter that is not hydrogen.\n\n===Gas and plasma phases===\n[[File:HeTube.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Helium discharge tube shaped like the element's atomic symbol|alt=Illuminated light red gas discharge tubes shaped as letters H and e]]\nHelium is the second least reactive noble gas after [[neon]], and thus the second least reactive of all elements.<ref>{{Cite book\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoFzgBSSCwEC&pg=PA70|title=Modelling Marvels|last=Lewars|first=Errol G. |publisher=Springer|date=2008|isbn=978-1-4020-6972-7|pages=70\u201371}}</ref> It is [[chemically inert]] and monatomic in all standard conditions.

Substitution reaction is their characteristics property (like chlorination reaction to form chloroform). Hydrocarbons with the same [[molecular formula]] but different [[structural formula]]e are called [[structural isomer]]s.<ref name=Silberberg/>{{rp|625}} As given in the example of 3-methylhexane and its higher [[homology (chemistry)|homologues]], branched hydrocarbons can be [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]].<ref name=Silberberg/>{{rp|627}} Chiral saturated hydrocarbons constitute the side chains of biomolecules such as [[chlorophyll]] and [[tocopherol]].<ref>Meierhenrich, Uwe.

This ability comes from the fact that the bond character between carbon atoms is entirely non-polar, in that the distribution of electrons between the two elements is somewhat even due to the same electronegativity values of the elements (~0.30), and does not result in the formation of an electrophile.\n\nGenerally, with catenation comes the loss of the total amount of bonded hydrocarbons and an increase in the amount of energy required for bond cleavage due to strain exerted upon the molecule; in molecules such as cyclohexane, this is referred to as [[ring strain]], and occurs due to the \"destabilized\" spatial electron configuration of the atom.\n\nIn simple chemistry, as per [[valence bond theory]], the carbon atom must follow the \"''4-hydrogen rule''\", which states that the maximum number of atoms available to bond with carbon is equal to the number of electrons that are attracted into the outer shell of carbon. In terms of shells, carbon consists of an incomplete outer shell, which comprises 4 electrons, and thus has 4 electrons available for covalent or [[dative bonding]].\n\nHydrocarbons are [[hydrophobic]] like [[lipid]]s.\n\nSome hydrocarbons also are abundant in the solar system. Lakes of liquid methane and ethane have been found on [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], Saturn's largest moon, confirmed by the Cassini-Huygens Mission.<ref>[http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-364 NASA's Cassini Spacecraft Reveals Clues About Saturn Moon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902080814/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-364 |date=2 September 2014 }}.

The predominant use of hydrocarbons is as a combustible [[fuel]] source.  In their solid form, hydrocarbons take the form of asphalt ([[bitumen]]).\n\nMixtures of volatile hydrocarbons are now used in preference to the [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s as a [[propellant]] for [[aerosol spray]]s, due to chlorofluorocarbons' impact on the [[ozone layer]].\n\n[[Methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>) and [[ethane]] (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) are gaseous at ambient temperatures and cannot be readily liquefied by pressure alone. [[Propane]] (C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>) is however easily liquefied, and exists in 'propane bottles' mostly as a liquid. [[Butane]] (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) is so easily liquefied that it provides a safe, volatile fuel for small pocket lighters. [[Pentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) is a clear liquid at room temperature, commonly used in chemistry and industry as a powerful nearly odorless [[solvent]] of waxes and high molecular weight organic compounds, including greases. [[Hexane]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>) is also a widely used non-polar, non-aromatic solvent, as well as a significant fraction of common [[gasoline]].\nThe C<sup>6</sup> through C<sup>10</sup> alkanes, alkenes and isomeric cycloalkanes are the top components of [[gasoline]], [[Petroleum naphtha|naphtha]], [[jet fuel]] and specialized industrial solvent mixtures. With the progressive addition of carbon units, the simple non-ring structured hydrocarbons have higher viscosities, lubricating indices, boiling points, solidification temperatures, and deeper color. At the opposite extreme from methane lie the heavy tars that remain as the ''lowest fraction'' in a crude oil refining retort. They are collected and widely utilized as roofing compounds, pavement composition, wood preservatives (the [[creosote]] series) and as extremely high viscosity shear-resisting liquids.\n\nHydrocarbon use is also prevalent in nature. Some eusocial arthropods, such as the Brazilian stingless bee ''[[Schwarziana quadripunctata]]'', use unique hydrocarbon \"scents\" in order to determine kin from non-kin. The chemical hydrocarbon composition varies between age, sex, nest location, and hierarchal position.<ref name=nunes09>{{cite journal|last=Nunes|first=T.M.|last2=Turatti|first2=I.C.C.|last3=Mateus|first3=S.|last4=Nascimento|first4=F.S.|last5=Lopes|first5=N.P.|last6=Zucchi|first6=R.|year=2009|title=Cuticular Hydrocarbons in the Stingless Bee Schwarziana quadripunctata (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini): Differences between Colonies, Castes and Age|journal=Genetics and Molecular Research|volume=8|issue=2|pages=589\u2013595|url=http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2009/vol8-2/pdf/kerr012.pdf|doi=10.4238/vol8-2kerr012|pmid=19551647|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926031231/http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2009/vol8-2/pdf/kerr012.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Poisoning==\nHydrocarbon [[poisoning]] such as that of [[benzene]] and [[petroleum]] usually occurs accidentally by inhalation or ingestion of these [[cytotoxic]] chemical compounds.

The hydrocarbon is burnt and the heat is used to heat water, which is then circulated. A similar principle is used to create electric energy in power plants.\n\nCommon properties of hydrocarbons are the facts that they produce steam, [[carbon dioxide]] and heat during [[combustion]] and that [[oxygen]] is required for combustion to take place.

Hydrocarbons \u2013 along with [[NOx|NO<sub>''x''</sub>]] and [[sunlight]] \u2013 contribute to the formation of [[tropospheric ozone]] and [[greenhouse gas]]es.\n\n====Bioremediation====\n\nBacteria in the [[Gabbro|gabbroic layer]] of the ocean's crust can degrade hydrocarbons; but the extreme environment makes research difficult.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Mason OU, Nakagawa T, Rosner M, Van Nostrand JD, Zhou J, Maruyama A, Fisk MR, Giovannoni SJ |title=First investigation of the microbiology of the deepest layer of ocean crust.|date=2010|pmid=21079766|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0015399|volume=5|issue=11|pmc=2974637|journal=PLoS ONE|pages=e15399|bibcode=2010PLoSO...515399M}}</ref> Other bacteria such as ''Lutibacterium anuloederans'' can also degrade hydrocarbons.<ref>{{cite journal\n| year=2007\n| title=Obligate oil-degrading marine bacteria\n| journal=Curr.

[[Benzene]] and many [[aromatic compound]]s are possible [[carcinogen]]s, and proper safety equipment must be worn to prevent these harmful compounds from entering the body. If hydrocarbons undergo combustion in tight areas, toxic [[carbon monoxide]] can form. Hydrocarbons should be kept away from [[fluorine]] compounds due to the high probability of forming toxic [[hydrofluoric acid]].\n\n== Environmental impact ==\nHydrocarbons are introduced into the environment through their extensive use as fuels and chemicals as well as through leaks or accidental spills during exploration, production, refining, or transport. Anthropogenic hydrocarbon contamination of soil is a serious global issue due to contaminant persistence and the negative impact on human health.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226738847_Microbial_Degradation_of_Alkanes|title=Microbial Degradation of Alkanes (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224053341/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226738847_Microbial_Degradation_of_Alkanes|archivedate=24 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abiogenic petroleum origin]]\n*[[Biohydrocarbon]]\n*[[Carbohydrate]]\n*[[Energy storage]]\n*[[Fractional distillation]]\n*[[Functional group]]\n*[[Hydrocarbon mixtures]]\n*[[Organically moderated and cooled reactor]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{sisterlinks|d=Q43648|c=Hydrocarbons|n=no|v=no|s=no|voy=no|m=no|mw=no|species=no|b=A-level Chemistry/OCR (Salters)/Hydrocarbons}}\n*[http://www.worldofmolecules.com/fuels/methane.htm The Methane Molecule]\n\n{{Hydrocarbons|state=expanded}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n[[Category:Hydrocarbons| ]]", "sha1": "2j77h5bgfygsf48g48lzl8555fkciow"}}, {"title": "Halogen", "ns": "0", "id": "13258", "revision": {"id": "865685984", "parentid": "865685917", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T14:33:28Z", "contributor": {"ip": "50.233.208.168"}, "comment": "/* History */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the chemical series}}\n{{periodic table (halogens)}}\n\nThe '''halogens''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|h|\u00e6|l|\u0259|d\u0292|\u0259|n|,_|\u02c8|h|e\u026a|-|,_|-|l|o\u028a|-|,_|-|\u02cc|d\u0292|\u025b|n}}<ref>{{Citation |last=Jones |first=Daniel |author-link=Daniel Jones (phonetician) |title=English Pronouncing Dictionary |editors=Peter Roach, James Hartmann and Jane Setter |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |orig-year=1917 |year=2003 |isbn=978-3-12-539683-8 }}</ref><ref>{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|Halogen}}</ref><ref>{{Dictionary.com|Halogen}}</ref>) are a [[group (periodic table)|group]] in the [[periodic table]] consisting of five chemically related [[chemical element|elements]]: [[fluorine]] (F), [[chlorine]] (Cl), [[bromine]] (Br), [[iodine]] (I), and [[astatine]] (At). The artificially created element 117 ([[tennessine]], Ts) may also be a halogen. In the modern [[IUPAC]] nomenclature, this group is known as '''group 17'''. The symbol '''X''' is often used generically to refer to any halogen.\n\nThe name \"halogen\" means \"salt-producing\". When halogens react with metals they produce a wide range of salts, including [[calcium fluoride]], [[sodium chloride]] (common table salt), [[silver bromide]] and [[potassium iodide]].\n\nThe group of halogens is the only [[Group (periodic table)|periodic table group]] that contains elements in three of the main [[State of matter|states of matter]] at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]]. All of the halogens form acids when bonded to hydrogen. Most halogens are typically produced from [[mineral]]s or [[salt (chemistry)|salts]]. The middle halogens, that is chlorine, bromine and iodine, are often used as [[disinfectant]]s. Organobromides are the most important class of [[flame retardant]]s. Elemental halogens are dangerous and can be lethally toxic.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n== History ==\nThe fluorine mineral [[fluorospar]] was known as early as 1529. Early chemists realized that fluorine compounds contain an undiscovered element, but were unable to isolate it. In 1860, [[George Gore (chemist)|George Gore]], an English chemist, ran a current of electricity through [[hydrofluoric acid]] and probably produced fluorine, but he was unable to prove his results at the time. In 1886, [[Henri Moissan]], a chemist in Paris, performed [[electrolysis]] on [[potassium bifluoride]] dissolved in anhydrous [[hydrogen fluoride]], and successfully isolated fluorine.<ref name=\"Nature's Building Blocks\">{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks|year=2011|isbn= 978-0199605637}}</ref>\n\n[[Hydrochloric acid]] was known to [[alchemy|alchemists]] and early chemists. However, elemental chlorine was not produced until 1774, when [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] heated hydrochloric acid with [[manganese dioxide]]. Scheele called the element \"dephlogisticated muriatic acid\", which is how chlorine was known for 33 years. In 1807, [[Humphry Davy]] investigated chlorine and discovered that it is an actual element. Chlorine combined with hydrochloric acid, as well as sulfuric acid in certain instances created chlorine gas a [[poisonous gas]] during [[World War I]]. It displaced oxygen in contaminated areas and replaced common oxygenated air with the toxic chlorine gas.  In which the gas would burn human tissue externally and internally, especially the lungs making breathing difficult or impossible depending on level of contamination.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nBromine was discovered in the 1820s by [[Antoine J\u00e9r\u00f4me Balard]]. Balard discovered bromine by passing chlorine gas through a sample of [[brine]]. He originally proposed the name ''muride'' for the new element, but the [[French Academy]] changed the element's name to bromine.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nIodine was discovered by [[Bernard Courtois]], who was using [[seaweed]] ash as part of a process for [[saltpeter]] manufacture. Courtois typically boiled the seaweed ash with water to generate [[potassium chloride]]. However, in 1811, Courtois added sulfuric acid to his process, and found that his process produced purple fumes that condensed into black crystals. Suspecting that these crystals were a new element, Courtois sent samples to other chemists for investigation. Iodine was proven to be a new element by [[Joseph Gay-Lussac]].<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nIn 1931, [[Fred Allison]] claimed to have discovered element 85 with a [[magneto-optical machine]], and named the element Alabamine, but was mistaken. In 1937, [[Rajendralal De]] claimed to have discovered element 85 in minerals, and called the element dakine, but he was also mistaken. An attempt at discovering element 85 in 1939 by [[Horia Hulubei]] and [[Yvette Cauchois]] via [[spectroscopy]] was also unsuccessful, as was an attempt in the same year by [[Walter Minder]], who discovered an iodine-like element resulting from [[beta decay]] of [[polonium]]. Element 85, now named astatine, was produced successfully in 1940 by [[Dale R. Corson]], [[K.R. Mackenzie]], and [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]], who bombarded [[bismuth]] with [[alpha particle]]s.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\n=== Etymology ===\nIn 1811, the German chemist [[Johann Schweigger]] proposed that the name \"halogen\" \u2013 meaning \"salt producer\", from \u03b1\u03bb\u03c2 [als] \"salt\" and \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd [genein] \"to beget\" \u2013 replace the name \"chlorine\", which had been proposed by the English chemist [[Humphry Davy]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Schweigger|first1=J.S.C.|title=Nachschreiben des Herausgebers, die neue Nomenclatur betreffend|journal=Journal f\u00fcr Chemie und Physik|date=1811|volume=3|issue=2|pages=249\u2013255|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101076802287;view=1up;seq=295|trans-title=Postscript of the editor concerning the new nomenclature|language=German}}  On p. 251, Schweigger proposed the word \"halogen\":  ''\"Man sage daf\u00fcr lieber mit richter Wortbildung ''Halogen'' (da schon in der Mineralogie durch ''Werner's'' Halit-Geschlecht dieses Wort nicht fremd ist) von \u03b1\u03bb\u03c2 ''Salz'' und dem alten \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (dorisch \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd) ''zeugen''.\"'' (One should say instead, with proper morphology, \"halogen\" (this word is not strange since [it's] already in mineralogy via Werner's \"halite\" species) from \u03b1\u03bb\u03c2 [als] \"salt\" and the old \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd [genein] (Doric \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03bd) \"to beget\".)</ref>  Davy's name for the element prevailed.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=J.

This high reactivity is due to the high [[electronegativity]] of the atoms due to their high [[effective nuclear charge]]. Because the halogens have seven valence electrons in their outermost energy level, they can gain an electron by reacting with atoms of other elements to satisfy the [[octet rule]]. [[Fluorine]] is one of the most reactive elements, attacking otherwise-inert materials such as glass, and forming compounds with the usually inert [[noble gas]]es. It is a [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] and highly toxic gas. The reactivity of fluorine is such that, if used or stored in laboratory glassware, it can react with glass in the presence of small amounts of water to form [[silicon tetrafluoride]] (SiF<sub>4</sub>). Thus, fluorine must be handled with substances such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene|Teflon]] (which is itself an [[organofluorine]] compound), extremely dry glass, or metals such as copper or steel, which form a protective layer of fluoride on their surface.\n\nThe high reactivity of fluorine allows paradoxically some of the strongest bonds possible, especially to carbon. For example, Teflon is fluorine bonded with carbon and is extremely resistant to thermal and chemical attack and has a high melting point.\n\n==== Molecules ====\n\n===== Diatomic halogen molecules =====\n\nThe halogens form [[homonuclear]] [[diatomic]] [[molecules]] (not proven for astatine).\nDue to relatively weak intermolecular forces, chlorine and fluorine form part of the group known as \"elemental gases\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! halogen || molecule || structure || model || ''d''(X\u2212X) / pm<br />(gas phase) || ''d''(X\u2212X) / pm<br />(solid phase)\n|-\n| <center>[[fluorine]]</center> || <center>F<sub>2</sub></center> || <center>[[Image:Difluorine-2D-dimensions.png|45px]]</center> || <center>[[Image:Fluorine-3D-vdW.png|45px]]</center> || <center>143</center> || <center>149</center>\n|-\n| <center>[[chlorine]]</center> || <center>Cl<sub>2</sub></center> || <center>[[Image:Dichlorine-2D-dimensions.png|70px]]</center> || <center>[[Image:Chlorine-3D-vdW.png|63px]]</center> || <center>199</center> || <center>198</center>\n|-\n| <center>[[bromine]]</center> || <center>Br<sub>2</sub></center> || <center>[[Image:Dibromine-2D-dimensions.png|80px]]</center> || <center>[[Image:Bromine-3D-vdW.png|72px]]</center> || <center>228</center> || <center>227</center>\n|-\n| <center>[[iodine]]</center> || <center>I<sub>2</sub></center> || <center>[[Image:Diiodine-2D-dimensions.png|70px]]</center> || <center>[[Image:Iodine-3D-vdW.png|84px]]</center> || <center>266</center> || <center>272</center>\n<!--don't add astatine; it's not proven to form At2 molecules-->\n|}\n\nThe elements become less reactive and have higher melting points as the atomic number increases. The higher melting points are caused by stronger [[London dispersion force]]s resulting from more electrons.\n\n==== Compounds ====\n\n===== Hydrogen halides =====\nAll of the halogens have been observed to react with hydrogen to form [[hydrogen halide]]s. For fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, this reaction is in the form of:\n\n: H<sub>2</sub> + X<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2HX\n\nHowever, hydrogen iodide and hydrogen astatide can split back into their constituent elements.<ref name = \"assorted\">{{Cite web|author = Jim Clark|url = http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group7/otherreactions.html|title = Assorted reactions of the halogens|year = 2011|accessdate = February 27, 2013|postscript = <!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Heated sodium's reaction with halogens produces bright-orange flames. Sodium's reaction with chlorine is in the form of:\n\n: {{math|2Na + Cl<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2NaCl}}<ref name = \"assorted\"/>\n\nIron reacts with fluorine, chlorine, and bromine to form Iron(III) halides. These reactions are in the form of:\n\n: {{math|2Fe + 3X<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2FeX<sub>3</sub>}}<ref name = \"assorted\"/>\n\nHowever, when iron reacts with iodine, it forms only [[iron(II) iodide]].\n\nIron wool can react rapidly with fluorine to form the white compound [[iron(III) fluoride]] even in cold temperatures. When chlorine comes into contact with heated iron, they react to form the black [[iron (III) chloride]]. However, if the reaction conditions are moist, this reaction will instead result in a reddish-brown product. Iron can also react with bromine to form [[iron(III) bromide]]. This compound is reddish-brown in dry conditions. Iron's reaction with bromine is less reactive than its reaction with fluorine or chlorine. Hot iron can also react with iodine, but it forms iron(II) iodide. This compound may be gray, but the reaction is always contaminated with excess iodine, so it is not known for sure. Iron's reaction with iodine is less vigorous than its reaction with the lighter halogens.<ref name = \"assorted\"/>\n\n===== Interhalogen compounds =====\n{{Main|Interhalogen}}\n\nInterhalogen compounds are in the form of XY<sub>n</sub> where X and Y are halogens and n is one, three, five, or seven. Interhalogen compounds contain at most two different halogens. Large interhalogens, such as {{math|ClF<sub>3</sub>}} can be produced by a reaction of a pure halogen with a smaller interhalogen such as {{math|ClF}}. All interhalogens except [[iodine heptafluoride|{{math|IF<sub>7</sub>}}]] can be produced by directly combining pure halogens in various conditions.<ref name = \"Chemistry of Interhalogens\">{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=nvatWdX1ZWcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title = Chemistry Of Interhalogen Compounds|year = 2007|accessdate = February 27, 2013|isbn = 9788183562430|author1 = Saxena|first1 = P. B}}</ref>\n\nInterhalogens are typically more reactive than all diatomic halogen molecules except F<sub>2</sub> because interhalogen bonds are weaker. However, the chemical properties of interhalogens are still roughly the same as those of [[diatomic]] halogens. Many interhalogens consist of one or more atoms of fluorine bonding to a heavier halogen. Chlorine can bond with up to 3 fluorine atoms, bromine can bond with up to five fluorine atoms, and iodine can bond with up to seven fluorine atoms. Most interhalogen compounds are [[covalent]] gases. However, there are some interhalogens that are liquids, such as BrF<sub>3</sub>, and many iodine-containing interhalogens are solids.<ref name = \"Chemistry of Interhalogens\"/>\n\n===== Organohalogen compounds =====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\nMany synthetic [[organic compounds]] such as [[plastic]] [[polymer]]s, and a few natural ones, contain halogen atoms; these are known as ''halogenated'' compounds or [[organic halide]]s. Chlorine is by far the most abundant of the halogens in seawater, and the only one needed in relatively large amounts (as chloride ions) by humans. For example, chloride ions play a key role in [[brain]] function by mediating the action of the inhibitory transmitter [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and are also used by the body to produce stomach acid. Iodine is needed in trace amounts for the production of [[thyroid]] hormones such as [[thyroxine]].

However, there are trace amounts in nature of the radioactive isotope fluorine-23, which occurs via [[cluster decay]] of [[protactinium-231]]. A total of eighteen isotopes of fluorine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 14 to 31. Chlorine has two stable and naturally occurring [[isotopes of chlorine|isotopes]], chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. However, there are trace amounts in nature of the isotope [[chlorine-36]], which occurs via [[spallation]] of argon-36. A total of 24 isotopes of chlorine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 28 to 51.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nThere are two stable and naturally occurring [[isotopes of bromine]], bromine-79 and bromine-81. A total of 32 isotopes of bromine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging 67 to 98. There is one stable and naturally occurring [[isotopes of iodine|isotope of iodine]], [[iodine-127]]. However, there are trace amounts in nature of the radioactive isotope [[iodine-129]], which occurs via spallation and from the radioactive decay of uranium in ores. Several other radioactive isotopes of iodine have also been created naturally via the decay of uranium. A total of 38 isotopes of iodine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 108 to 145.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nThere are no stable [[isotopes of astatine]]. However, there are three naturally occurring radioactive isotopes of astatine produced via radioactive decay of [[uranium]], [[neptunium]], and [[plutonium]]. These isotopes are astatine-215, astatine-217, and astatine-219. A total of 31 isotopes of astatine have been discovered, with atomic masses ranging from 193 to 223.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\n== Production ==\nApproximately six million metric tons of the fluorine mineral [[fluorite]] are produced each year. Four hundred-thousand metric tons of hydrofluoric acid are made each year. Fluorine gas is made from hydrofluoric acid produced as a by-product in [[phosphoric acid]] manufacture. Approximately 15,000 metric tons of fluorine gas are made per year.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nThe mineral [[halite]] is the mineral that is most commonly mined for chlorine, but the minerals [[carnallite]] and [[sylvite]] are also mined for chlorine. Forty million metric tons of chlorine are produced each year by the [[electrolysis]] of [[brine]].<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nApproximately 450,000 metric tons of bromine are produced each year. Fifty percent of all bromine produced is produced in the [[United States]], 35% in [[Israel]], and most of the remainder in [[China]]. Historically, bromine was produced by adding [[sulfuric acid]] and bleaching powder to natural brine. However, in modern times, bromine is produced by electrolysis, a method invented by [[Herbert Dow]]. It is also possible to produce bromine by passing chlorine through seawater and then passing air through the seawater.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nIn 2003, 22,000 metric tons of iodine were produced. Chile produces 40% of all iodine produced, [[Japan]] produces 30%, and smaller amounts are produced in [[Russia]] and the United States. Until the 1950s, iodine was extracted from [[kelp]]. However, in modern times, iodine is produced in other ways. One way that iodine is produced is by mixing [[sulfur dioxide]] with [[nitrate]] ores, which contain some [[iodate]]s. Iodine is also extracted from [[natural gas]] fields.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nEven though astatine is naturally occurring, it is usually produced by bombarding bismuth with alpha particles.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\n[[Image:Halogens.jpg|thumb|320px|right|From left to right: [[chlorine]], [[bromine]], and [[iodine]] at room temperature. Chlorine is a gas, bromine is a liquid, and iodine is a solid. [[Fluorine]] could not be included in the image due to its high [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]], and astatine due to its radioactivity.]]\n\n== Applications ==\n\nBoth chlorine and bromine are used as [[disinfectants]] for drinking water, swimming pools, fresh wounds, spas, dishes, and surfaces. They kill [[bacteria]] and other potentially harmful [[microorganism]]s through a process known as [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. Their reactivity is also put to use in [[Bleaching agent|bleaching]]. [[Sodium hypochlorite]], which is produced from chlorine, is the active ingredient of most [[Cloth|fabric]] bleaches, and chlorine-derived bleaches are used in the production of some [[paper]] products. Chlorine also reacts with sodium to create [[sodium chloride]], which is table salt.\n\n[[Halogen lamp]]s are a type of incandescent lamp using a [[tungsten]] filament in bulbs that have a small amounts of a halogen, such as iodine or bromine added. This enables the production of lamps that are much smaller than non-halogen [[incandescent lightbulb]]s at the same [[watt]]age. The gas reduces the thinning of the filament and blackening of the inside of the bulb resulting in a bulb that has a much greater life. Halogen lamps glow at a higher temperature (2800 to 3400 [[kelvin]]s) with a whiter color than other incandescent bulbs. However, this requires bulbs to be manufactured from [[fused quartz]] rather than silica glass to reduce breakage.<ref name=Edison>{{cite web|title=The Halogen Lamp|url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/halogen.html|website=Edison Tech Center|publisher=Edison Steinmetz Center, Schenectady, New York|accessdate=2014-09-05 }}</ref>\n\nIn [[drug discovery]], the incorporation of halogen atoms into a lead drug candidate results in analogues that are usually more [[lipophilic]] and less water-soluble.<ref>{{cite book| first = G. | last= Thomas | title =Medicinal Chemistry an Introduction | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, West Sussex, UK| year=  2000 | isbn= 978-0-470-02597-0}}</ref> As a consequence, halogen atoms are used to improve penetration through [[lipid membrane]]s and tissues. It follows that there is a tendency for some halogenated drugs to accumulate in [[adipose tissue]].\n\nThe chemical reactivity of halogen atoms depends on both their point of attachment to the lead and the nature of the halogen. [[Aromatic]] halogen groups are far less reactive than [[aliphatic]] halogen groups, which can exhibit considerable chemical reactivity. For aliphatic carbon-halogen bonds, the C-F bond is the strongest and usually less chemically reactive than aliphatic C-H bonds. The other aliphatic-halogen bonds are weaker, their reactivity increasing down the periodic table. They are usually more chemically reactive than aliphatic C-H bonds. As a consequence, the most common halogen substitutions are the less reactive aromatic fluorine and chlorine groups.\n\n== Biological role ==\nFluoride anions are found in ivory, bones, teeth, blood, eggs, urine, and hair of organisms. Fluoride anions in very small amounts may be essential for humans.<ref name=\"who.int\">{{cite web|last1=Fawell|first1=J. |title=Fluoride in Drinking-water|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/fluoride.pdf|publisher=World Health Organisation|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> There are 0.5 milligrams of fluorine per liter of human blood. Human bones contain 0.2 to 1.2% fluorine. Human tissue contains approximately 50 parts per billion of fluorine. A typical 70-kilogram human contains 3 to 6 grams of fluorine.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nChloride anions are essential to a large number of species, humans included. The concentration of chlorine in the [[dry weight]] of cereals is 10 to 20 parts per million, while in [[potato]]es the concentration of chloride is 0.5%. Plant growth is adversely affected by chloride levels in the [[soil]] falling below 2 parts per million. Human blood contains an average of 0.3% chlorine. Human bone typically contains 900 parts per million of chlorine. Human tissue contains approximately 0.2 to 0.5% chlorine. There is a total of 95 grams of chlorine in a typical 70-kilogram human.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nSome bromine in the form of the bromide anion is present in all organisms. A biological role for bromine in humans has not been proven, but some organisms contain [[organobromine compound]]s. Humans typically consume 1 to 20 milligrams of bromine per day. There are typically 5 parts per million of bromine in human blood, 7 parts per million of bromine in human bones, and 7 parts per million of bromine in human tissue. A typical 70-kilogram human contains 260 milligrams of bromine.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nHumans typically consume less than 100 micrograms of iodine per day. Iodine deficiency can cause [[intellectual disability]]. [[organoiodine chemistry|Organoiodine compound]]s occur in humans in some of the [[gland]]s, especially the [[thyroid gland]], as well as the [[stomach]], [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]], and [[immune system]]. Foods containing iodine include [[Cod (food)|cod]], [[oyster]]s, [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], [[Herring (food)|herring]], [[lobster]]s, [[sunflower seed]]s, [[seaweed]], and [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]]. However, iodine is not known to have a biological role in plants. There are typically 0.06 milligrams per liter of iodine in human blood, 300 parts per billion of iodine in human bones, and 50 to 700 parts per billion of iodine in human tissue. There are 10 to 20 milligrams of iodine in a typical 70-kilogram human.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\n[[Astatine]] has no biological role.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\n== Toxicity ==\nThe halogens tend to decrease in toxicity towards the heavier halogens.<ref name = \"The Elements\"/>\n\nFluorine gas is extremely toxic; breathing in fluorine at a concentration of 25 parts per million is potentially lethal.  Hydrofluoric acid is also toxic, being able to penetrate skin and cause highly painful [[chemical burn|burns]]. In addition, fluoride anions are toxic, but not as toxic as pure fluorine. Fluoride can be lethal in amounts of 5 to 10 grams. Prolonged consumption of fluoride above concentrations of 1.5&nbsp;mg/L is associated with a risk of [[dental fluorosis]], an aesthetic condition of the teeth.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Guidelines and standards|title=Fluoride in Drinking-water|last1=Fawell | first1=J.|last2= Bailey |first2=K.|last3 =  Chilton |first3= J. |last4=Dahi |first4=E. |last5=Fewtrell |first5=L. |last6=Magara |first6=Y.|publisher=World Health Organization|isbn=978-92-4-156319-2|year=2006|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/publications/fluoride_drinking_water_full.pdf|format=PDF|pages=37\u20139}}</ref> At concentrations above 4&nbsp;mg/L, there is an increased risk of developing [[skeletal fluorosis]], a condition in which bone fractures become more common due to the hardening of bones.

Breathing in chlorine at a concentration of 3 parts per million can rapidly cause a toxic reaction. Breathing in chlorine at a concentration of 50 parts per million is highly dangerous. Breathing in chlorine at a concentration of 500 parts per million for a few minutes is lethal. Breathing in chlorine gas is highly painful.<ref name=\"The Elements\">{{cite book|last=Gray|first=Theodore|title=The Elements|year=2010 | isbn= 9781579128951 }}</ref>\n\nPure bromine is somewhat toxic, but less toxic than fluorine and chlorine. One hundred milligrams of bromine is lethal.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/> Bromide anions are also toxic, but less so than bromine. Bromide has a lethal dose of 30 grams.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nIodine is somewhat toxic, being able to irritate the lungs and eyes, with a safety limit of 1 milligram per cubic meter. When taken orally, 3 grams of iodine can be lethal. Iodide anions are mostly nontoxic, but these can also be deadly if ingested in large amounts.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\nAstatine is very [[radioactive]] and thus highly dangerous, but it has not been produced in macroscopic quantities and hence it is most unlikely that its toxicity will be of much relevance to the average individual.<ref name = \"Nature's Building Blocks\"/>\n\n== Superhalogen ==\n{{Main|Superatom}}\n\nCertain aluminium clusters have superatom properties. These aluminium clusters are generated as anions ({{math|Al{{su|b=''n''|p=\u2212}}}} with ''n'' = 1,\u20092,\u20093,\u2009...\u2009) in helium gas and reacted with a gas containing iodine.

On UNIX, the base directory of an account is called \"[[Home directory|home]]\", and the <code>HOME</code> environment variable contains its [[Path (computing)|path]] (for example <code>/home/my_username</code>).

It aired first-run on [[CBS]] from 1969 to 1971, in [[television syndication|syndication]] from 1971 to 1993, and on [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] from 1996 to 1997. [[RFD-TV]] began airing reruns in 2008, where it currently remains.\n\nThe show was inspired by ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'',<ref name = \"Brillstein\" /> the major difference being that ''Hee Haw'' was far less topical, and was centered on country music and rural culture. Hosted by country music artists [[Buck Owens]] and [[Roy Clark]] for most of its run, the show was equally well known for its voluptuous, scantily clad women in stereotypical [[farmer's daughter (character)|farmer's daughter]] outfits and country-style [[minidress]]es (a group that came to be known as the \"Hee Haw Honeys\"), and its [[corn pone]] humor.\n\n''Hee Haw'''s appeal, however, was not limited to a rural audience. It was successful in all of the major markets, including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Chicago. Other niche programs such as ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'' (which targeted older audiences) and ''[[Soul Train]]'' (which targeted black  audiences) also rose to prominence in syndication during the era. Like ''Laugh-In'', the show minimized production costs by taping all of the recurring [[sketch comedy|sketches]] for a season in batches, setting up for the Cornfield one day, the Joke Fence on another day, etc. At the height of its popularity, an entire season's worth of shows would be taped in two separate week-long sessions, then individual shows were assembled from edited sections. Only musical performances were taped with a live audience; a [[laugh track]] was added to all other segments.\n\nThe series was taped for CBS at its network affiliate WLAC-TV (now [[WTVF]])<ref>[http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=5999571 newschannel5.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228085007/http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=5999571 |date=2008-02-28 }}</ref> in downtown Nashville, and later at [[Opryland USA]] in the Donelson area of Nashville.<ref>[http://www.heehaw.com/kornnews.html heehaw.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20060526125856/http://www.heehaw.com/kornnews.html |date=2006-05-26 }}</ref> The show was produced by Yongestreet Productions through the mid-1980s; it was later produced by [[Gaylord Entertainment Company|Gaylord Entertainment]], which distributed the show in syndication. The show's name was coined by show business talent manager and producer [[Bernie Brillstein]] and derives from a common English [[onomatopoeia]] used to describe the braying sound that a [[donkey]] makes.<ref name = \"Brillstein\">{{cite book\n |last = Brillstein\n |first = Bernie\n |authorlink = Bernie Brillstein\n |title = Where Did I Go Right?: You're No One In Hollywood Unless Someone Wants You Dead!\n |publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]]\n |author2=David Rensin\n |year = 1999\n |isbn = 978-0-316-11885-9\n |page = 86\n |quote = Suddenly it hit me: How about a country Laugh-In?

TNN would eventually order an additional season of first-run episodes, beginning November 23, 1996. The show ultimately ended for good on December 27, 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/HEE-HAW-COLLECTION-DVDs-Time-Life/dp/B001FREI1Y#productDescription_secondary_view_div_1513791498884|title=HEE HAW COLLECTION: 7 DVDs|author=|date=|publisher=|via=Amazon}}</ref>\n\n==Creation and syndication==\n''Hee Haw's'' creators, [[Frank Peppiatt]] and [[John Aylesworth]], were both Canadian-born writers who had extensive experience in writing for variety shows. Inspired by the massive success of rural sitcoms of the 1960s, especially on CBS, [[Peppiatt and Aylesworth]] sought to capitalize on that by creating a variety show that catered to the same audience, this despite neither one having a firm grasp on rural comedy.<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|first=Greg|last=Braxton|title=rank Peppiatt dies at 85; co-creator of 'Hee Haw' |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/nov/09/local/la-me-frank-peppiatt-20121109|work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |publisher= |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2012-12-03}}</ref> Its two hosts represented both sides in a divide in country/western music at the time: [[Buck Owens]] was the prominent architect of the California-based [[Bakersfield sound]], while [[Roy Clark]] was a stalwart of Tennessee's [[Music Row]]. Peppiatt and Aylesworth brought on two fellow Canadian writers with more experience in rural humor, [[Gordie Tapp]] and [[Don Harron]].\n\n''Hee Haw'' premiered on CBS as a summer [[1969 in television|1969]] replacement for ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''. Though the show had respectable ratings (it sat at #16 for the 1970-71 season), it was dropped in July 1971 by CBS as part of the so-called \"[[Rural purge|Rural Purge]]\" (along with fellow country-themed shows ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', and ''[[Green Acres]]''). The success of ''Hee Haw'' and other country-themed shows was the source of a heated dispute in CBS's corporate offices; [[Michael Dann]], although he personally disliked the shows, considered total viewership the benchmark of success and encouraged the shows to stay on the air, while [[Fred Silverman]] believed certain demographics\u2014the ones in which ''Hee Haw'' and the others performed poorly\u2014could draw more advertising dollars. Silverman's view won out, and CBS canceled the rural shows in summer 1971.\n\nUndaunted, the producers put together a syndication deal for the show, which continued in roughly the same format for the rest of its run. Peppiatt and Aylesworth's company, Yongestreet Productions (named for [[Yonge Street]], a prominent thoroughfare in their home city of [[Toronto]]) maintained ownership of the series.\n\nDuring the show's peak in popularity, ''Hee Haw'' often competed in syndication against ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', a long-running ABC program which had also been canceled in 1971, also in an attempt to purge the networks of older demographic-leaning programs. Like ''Hee Haw'', ''Lawrence Welk'' was picked up for syndication in the fall of 1971, and there were some markets where the same station aired both programs. (The success of ''Hee Haw'' and ''Lawrence Welk'' in syndication, and the network decisions that led to their respective cancellations, were the inspiration for a novelty song called \"[[The Lawrence Welk-Hee Haw Counter-Revolution Polka]],\" performed by Clark; the song became a top 10 hit on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in the fall of 1972.) ''Welk'' and ''Hee Haw'' also competed against another music-oriented niche program that moved to syndication in 1971: ''[[Soul Train]]'', a black-oriented program (originally a local program based in Chicago) that also went on to a very long run in syndication.\n\nMirroring the long downward trend in the popularity of variety shows in general that had taken place in the 1970s, ratings began to decline for ''Hee Haw'' around 1986. That year, Owens departed as host, and Yongestreet sold the show to [[Ryman Hospitality Properties|Gaylord Entertainment]] (best known for the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' and its related businesses). Clark continued to host the show with a celebrity guest each week. The ratings decline continued into the early 1990s, and in the fall of 1991, in an attempt to win back viewers and attract a younger audience, the show's format and setting underwent a dramatic overhaul. The changes included a new title (''The Hee Haw Show''), more pop-oriented country music, and the barnyard-cornfield setting replaced by a city street and [[shopping mall]] set. The first of the new shows aired in January 1992. Despite the attempt to keep the show fresh, the changes alienated many of its longtime viewers while failing to gain the hoped-for younger viewers, and the ratings continued their decline.\n\nDuring the summer of 1992, a decision was made to end first-run production, and instead air highlights of the show's earlier years in a revamped program called ''Hee Haw Silver'' (as part of celebrating the show's 25th season).<ref group='notes'>The show debuted as a mid-season replacement in June 1969 and because of this its first season is considered to be those first few months on the summer schedule. Its 24th season is referred to the batch of shows that aired from January through May 1992 when it was re-titled ''The Hee Haw Show''. The fall of 1992 marked the beginning of the program's 25th season on the air.</ref> Under the new format, Clark hosted a mixture of classic clips and new footage.\n\nThe ''Hee Haw Silver'' episodes spotlighted many of their classic sketches and musical performances from the show, with a series of retrospective looks at performers who had since died, such as [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]], Archie Campbell, Junior Samples, and Kenny Price. According to the show's producer, [[Sam Lovullo]], the ratings showed improvement with these classic reruns; however, the series was finally canceled in June 1993 at the conclusion of its 25th season. ''Hee Haw'' continued to pop up in reruns (see below for details) throughout the 1990s and later during the following decade, in a series of successful [[DVD]] releases from [[Time Life]].\n\n===Reruns===\nAfter the show's syndication run ended, [[rerun]]s aired on [[The Nashville Network]] from 1993 until [[1996]]. Upon the cancellation of reruns in 1996 the program resurfaced, for another first-run season, ultimately concluding the series in 1997. Its 22 years in TV syndication (1971\u201393) was the record for the longest-running U.S. syndicated TV program, until ''[[Soul Train]]'' surpassed it in 1993; ''Hee Haw'' remains the fifth longest-running syndicated American TV program, though the longest-running of its genre. (The current record is ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', which has been on the air for {{years ago|1981|9}} years.)\n\nDuring the 2006\u201307 season [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] aired a series of reruns and [[TV Land]] also recognized the series with an award presented by [[k.d. lang]]; in attendance were Roy Clark, [[Gunilla Hutton]], [[Barbi Benton]], the Hager twins, [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]], [[Misty Rowe]], and others. It was during this point, roughly between the years of 2004 and 2007, that [[Time Life]] began selling selected episodes of the show on DVD. Among the DVD content offered was the 1978 10th anniversary special that hadn't been seen since its original airing. CMT sporadically aired the series, usually in [[graveyard slot]]s, and primarily held the rights in order to be able to air the musical performances as part of their [[music video]] library (such as during the \"Pure Vintage\" block on [[CMT Pure Country]]).\n\nReruns of ''Hee Haw'' began airing on [[RFD-TV]] in September 2008, where it currently remains, anchoring the network's Sunday night lineup, although beginning in January 2014 an episode airs on Saturday afternoon and the same episode is rerun the following Sunday night. In 2011, the network began re-airing the earliest episodes from 1969\u201370 on Thursday evenings. That summer, many of the surviving cast members, along with a number of country artists who were guest stars on the show, taped a ''Country's Family Reunion'' special, entitled ''Salute to the Kornfield'', which aired on RFD-TV in January 2012. The special is also part of ''Country's Family Reunion's'' DVD series. Concurrent with the special was the unveiling of a ''Hee Haw'' exhibit, titled ''Pickin' and Grinnin' '', at the [[Oklahoma History Center]] in [[Oklahoma City]].\n\nAs part of the promotions for its DVD products, Time-Life also compiles and syndicates a half-hour [[clip show]] series, ''The Hee Haw Collection''.\n\n==Cast members==\nTwo rural-style comedians, already well known in their native Canada, gained their first major U.S. exposure: [[Gordie Tapp]] and [[Don Harron]] (whose KORN Radio character, newscaster Charlie Farquharson, had been a fixture of Canadian television since 1952 and later appeared on ''[[The Red Green Show]]'').\n\nOther cast members over the years included, but were not limited to:\n[[Roy Acuff]],\nCathy Baker (as the show's [[Master of ceremonies|emcee]]),\n[[Billy Jim Baker]],\n[[Barbi Benton]],\nKelly Billingsley,\nVicki Bird,\nJennifer Bishop,\n[[Archie Campbell]],\nPhil Campbell,\nHarry Cole (Weeping Willie),\nMackenzie Colt,\n[[John Henry Faulk]],\n[[Tennessee Ernie Ford]],\n[[Marianne Gordon]] (Rogers),\n[[Hager Twins|Jim and Jon Hager]],\nVictoria Hallman,\nDiana Goodman,\n[[Gunilla Hutton]],\nLinda Johnson,\n[[Grandpa Jones]],\n[[Zella Lehr]] (the \"unicycle girl\"),\n[[George Lindsey]] (reprising his \"[[Goober Pyle|Goober]]\" character from ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]''),\nJimmy Little,\n[[Irlene Mandrell]],\n[[Charlie McCoy]],\nDawn McKinley,\nPatricia McKinnon,\nSherry Miles,\n[[Grady Nutt|Rev. Grady Nutt]],\n[[Minnie Pearl]],\nClaude \"Jackie\" Phelps,\n[[Slim Pickens]],\n[[Kenny Price]],\n[[Anne Randall]],\nChase Randolph,\n[[Susan Raye]],\n[[Jimmie Riddle]],\n[[Jeannine Riley]],\n[[Alice Ripley]],\n[[Lulu Roman]],\n[[Misty Rowe]],\n[[Junior Samples]],\nRay Sanders,\nTerry Sanders,\n[[Gailard Sartain]],\nDiana Scott,\n[[Shotgun Red]],\nGerald Smith (the \"Georgia Quacker\"),\nJeff Smith,\nDonna Stokes,\nDennis Stone,\n[[Roni Stoneman]],\nMary Taylor,\nNancy Taylor,\n[[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]],\nLisa Todd,\nPedro Tomas,\nNancy Traylor, \n[[Buck Trent]],\nJackie Waddell, \nPat Woodell, and\n[[Jonathan Winters]], among many others.\n\n[[The Buckaroos]] (Buck Owens' band) initially served as the [[house band]] on the show and consisted of members [[Don Rich]], Jim Shaw, [[Jerry Brightman]], Jerry Wiggins, Rick Taylor, Doyle Singer (Doyle Curtsinger), Don Lee, Ronnie Jackson, Terry Christoffersen, [[Doyle Holly]], and in later seasons fiddle player [[Jana Jae]], and Victoria Hallman, who replaced Don Rich on harmony vocals (Rich was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1974). In later seasons, harmonica player [[Charlie McCoy]] joined the cast and became the show's music director, forming the ''Hee Haw Band'', which became the house band for the remainder of the series' run. The Nashville Edition, a four-member (two male, two female) singing group, served as the background singers for most of the musical performances.\n\nSome of the cast members made national headlines: [[Lulu Roman]] was twice charged with drug possession in 1971, [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]] and his wife were murdered in November 1973 during a robbery at their home; and as mentioned above, Buck Owens' lead guitarist and harmony singer Don Rich of the Buckaroos was killed in a motorcycle crash in 1974.\n\nSome cast members, such as Charlie McCoy and Tennessee Ernie Ford, originally appeared on the show as guest stars.\n\nAfter Buck Owens left the show, a different country music artist would accompany Roy Clark as a guest co-host each week, who would give the episode's opening performance, participate with Clark in the \"Pickin' and Grinnin'\" sketch, and assist Clark in introducing the other guest stars' performances.  The show's final season (''Hee Haw Silver'') was hosted by Clark alone.\n\n==Recurring sketches and segments==\nSome of the most popular sketches and segments on ''Hee Haw'' included, but were not limited to:\n*\"'''PFFT! You Was Gone!'''\"\u2014A comedic duet featured on the premiere episode. In the first few seasons, the song was performed by Archie Campbell, with Gordie Tapp joining on the chorus. In later seasons, a guest star would join Campbell (or another cast member, usually Tapp, Grandpa Jones, George Lindsey, Kenny Price, Roni Stoneman, Roy Acuff or Dub Taylor) on the chorus, and the guest star's name would be mentioned somewhere in the song's verse prior to the chorus. On episodes that featured more than one major guest star, the sketch would be repeated so that all the guest stars would have an opportunity to participate. Tapp or the guest star would often stand with his or her back to the viewer holding a pitchfork while Campbell, or the other cast member, holding a scythe, sang the verse. At the end of the verse, Campbell or the cast member would nudge Tapp or the guest star with his or her elbow, as a form of [[comic timing|slapstick timing]], whereby Tapp or the guest star would then spin around to the camera (reacting as if awakened by the elbow nudge) to join him or her on the chorus:\n\n{{poemquote|\nWhere, oh where, are you tonight?\nWhy did you leave me here all alone?\nI searched the world over, and I thought I'd found true love,\nYou met another, and PFFT! You was gone!}}\n\n:The \"PFFT\" would be done as \"[[blowing a raspberry]],\" and occasionally, the duo would break up into laughter after the \"PFFT,\" unable to finish the song; who got spat upon during the \"PFFT\" would change each show. Following Campbell's death, whole groups and even women would be part of the chorus, with regular George Lindsay often singing the verse. Occasionally, in the later years, [[Roni Stoneman]] (in her role of Ida Lee Nagger) would sometimes sing the verse.\n*'''KORN News'''\u2014[[Don Harron]], as KORN radio announcer Charlie Farquharson, would humorously [[parody|spoof]] the delivery of local news, in his own inimitable way. In later seasons, KORN would become KORV. Harron had been performing the character since 1952 on Canadian television, and would continue playing Farquharson in many other media venues before, during and after ''Hee Haw''. (The fictional radio station is not to be confused with the [[Mitchell, South Dakota]]-based [[KORN (AM)]], [[KORN-FM]], nor [[Lakeview, Oregon]]-based [[KORV]].) \n*'''Lulu's Truck Stop'''\u2014Lulu Roman owned this greasy spoon, where the food and customer service was usually pretty bad; Gailard Sartain was also in this sketch as the chef Orville.\n*'''Hee Haw Players'''\u2014Cast members take on some of the [[Shakespeare]] classics, with some unexpected twists.\n*'''Hee Haw Amateur Minute'''\u2014A showcase of some of the worst talent of all. A cast member would play some [[yokel]] who would have some kind of bad talent, which would almost always end up with the audience [[booing]] it; throwing vegetables and the hook operator yanking said act forcibly off the stage. After the sketch, five animated cartoon animals (a duck, a sheep, a pig, a chicken, and a goat) would appear onscreen booing as well.\n*'''Samuel B. Sternwheeler'''\u2014Gordie Tapp in a spoof of author [[Mark Twain]] giving off some homilies which intentionally made little or no sense whatsoever. After these recitations, he would most often be hit over the head with a [[rubber chicken]], or in later years be given a bomb or something that would eventually explode, leaving him covered in soot and a shredded suit.\n*'''Stringbean's Letter From Home'''-Cast members would sit around a barn porch setting, listening to Stringbean read a letter that he receives from home. The letters included stories delivered in [[punch line]] format.\n*'''The Haystack'''\u2014A male cast member (usually either Buck Owens or one of the Hager twins; later Chase Randolph, Jeff Smith, or Kelly Billingsey), and (usually) one of the Hee Haw Honeys talk about love issues while sitting at the haystack (the sketches began with just the top of the haystack on camera and then panned down to reveal the couple).\n*'''Colonel Daddy's Daughter'''\u2014Marianne Gordon was the pampered [[southern belle]] daughter of her Colonel Daddy (Gordie Tapp in his role of Samuel Sternwheeler). She would sit on the swing at her plantation home, and would speak about the generosity of her Daddy. In later sketches, Tapp's character would no longer be seen but was always referenced to by his spoiled daughter. This sketch replaced the \"Samuel B. Sternwheeler\" sketch, which had previously been discontinued.\n*'''The Moonshiners'''\u2014Two of the male cast members, playing a couple of lethargic hillbillies, who would lazily tell a joke while dozing on the floor near a bunch of [[moonshine]] jugs and Beauregard the Wonder Dog (Kingfish the Wonder Dog in earlier seasons, Buford the Wonder Dog in later seasons), with three or four of the Hee Haw Honeys reclining in the background.\n*'''School Scenes'''\u2014There were always school scenes throughout the series' run. At first, it was with [[Jennifer Bishop]] and Lulu Roman as the put-upon teachers, with most notably Junior Samples and Roy Clark as the students. When Minnie Pearl became the teacher, the set was a larger classroom with, at first, real children as the students, but would later return to the cast members playing children, with Pearl still as the teacher.\n*'''Advice to the Loveworn'''\u2014Hee Haw Honey Lisa Todd, reclining on a living room sofa, gives wacky love advice in a sultry manner and closes the sketch by winking at the camera. In later seasons of the sketch, George Lindsay, who provided the voice-over introduction in earlier seasons, now appeared on screen wearing a [[leisure suit]], introducing the sketch. \n*'''The Culhanes of Cornfield County'''\u2014The adventures of the Culhane family, depicted as all they did was sit on an old-fashioned sofa in the parlor, which focused on Cousin Clem Culhane (Gordie Tapp); Cousin Junior Culhane (Junior Samples); Cousin Grandpa Culhane (Grandpa Jones); and Cousin Lulu Culhane (Lulu Roman) who would sit in deadpan character and comment, \u00e0 la [[soap opera]]. After the death of Samples, his role was filled by cast member [[Mike Snider (musician)|Mike Snider]] in the role of Cousin Mike.\n*'''Pickin' and Grinnin'''\u2014Musical interludes with Owens (on guitar) and Clark (on banjo) and the entire cast (Owens: \"I'm a-pickin'!\"; Clark: \"And I'm a-grinnin'!\"), with the duo (and sometimes a major guest star\u2014such as [[Johnny Cash]]\u2014sitting between Owens and Clark) \"dueling\" by playing guitar and banjo the instrumental to \"[[Cripple Creek (folk song)|Cripple Creek]],\" telling jokes and reciting one-liners. The sketch always ended with Clark's banjo solo, each time ending a different comical way. For the first couple of seasons the sketch featured only Clark and Owens, and in later seasons the entire cast participated. When the entire cast began participating, the sketch was introduced by the show's emcee Cathy Baker. This sketch would always open the second half of the show.\n*'''Samples Sales'''\u2014Junior Samples, as a used car salesman, would try to palm off a major \"clunker\" and then hold up a sign to remind viewers that his phone number was \"BR-549.\" (In later seasons, the number was changed to BR-1Z1Z. Also by this time, local phone calls in virtually all of the United States required dialing seven-digit numbers.) The reason for the change from BR-549 to BR-1Z1Z was during the 1980 season, Junior gave up the car lot and became a \"consumer advocate\" whose job was to save the public from dishonest people like himself. The next season, he went back to the car lot gig but changed the number. Hee Haw Honey Misty Rowe joined Samples in later seasons as his assistant, and during this time Samples at one point would guise himself as a magician, whom Rowe would introduce as \"Junior the Great.\"\n:(''Hee Haw'' videos were later sold on TV using the \"800\" number 1-800-BR54949; also, the country music group [[BR5-49]] adopted the number as the name of the group.)\n*'''\"Gloom, Despair, and Agony On Me\"'''\u2014Another popular sketch usually performed by four male cast members (originally\u2014and usually\u2014Roy Clark; Gordie Tapp; Grandpa Jones and Archie Campbell) sitting around in hillbilly garb surrounded by [[moonshine]] jugs and looking overtly miserable. The song began with the chorus, which all of them sang with each one alternating (in [[lip-synch]]) a mournful howl after each of the first three lines. The chorus went:\n\n{{poemquote|\nGloom, despair, and agony on me-e!\nDeep dark depression, excessive misery-y!\nIf it weren't for bad luck I'd have no luck at all!\nGloom, despair, and agony on me-e-e!}}\n\n:The quartet began by singing the chorus together, followed by each quartet member reciting some humorous reason for his misery in spoken form, then (in the first several seasons) the quartet would reprise the chorus and end with all four sobbing in typical overstated manner.\n\n:Sometimes, in later seasons, a male guest star would participate in the sketch as the fourth member tearfully reciting the reason for his misery.\n\n:Also in later seasons, female cast members did their own version of the sketch, first just lip-synching the male vocals in the song, but later getting their own feminized version complete with female howls of mourning.\n*'''The Gossip Girls'''\u2014This sketch is the female counterpart of \"Gloom, Despair ...\" which featured four female cast members surrounding a washtub and clothes wringer singing the chorus:\n\n{{poemquote|\nNow, we're not ones to go 'round spreadin' rumors,\nWhy, really we're just not the gossipy kind,\nNo, you'll never hear one of us repeating gossip,\nSo you'd better be sure and listen close the first time!}}\n\n:Two of the four girls then sang the verse. Misty Rowe, a long-time member of the \"Gossip Girls,\" would enhance the comedy of the sketch by singing her part of the verse out of tune (as a young child would do). In later years, male cast members, in [[drag queen|drag]], would sometimes replace the girls in the sketch, in retaliation for the girls singing \"Gloom, Despair.\" Sometimes, in later seasons, the four female cast members sang the song on the Cornfield set, with a male guest star standing in the center, between the four girls.\n\n:''(For the first few seasons of each sketch, the \"Gossip Girls\" and \"Gloom, Despair\" songs began with the chorus, then the verse, and ended with a repeat of the chorus; but in later seasons the repeat of the chorus was discontinued, with the songs ending after the verse.)''\n\n*'''\"Hee Haw Salutes ...\"'''\u2014Two or three times in each episode, ''Hee Haw'' would salute a selected town (or a guest star's hometown) and announce its population, which was sometimes altered for levity, at which point the entire cast would then \"pop up\" in the Cornfield set, shouting \"SAA-LUTE!!\" Initially ending with laughter, this was changed by the mid-1970s to applause as a nod toward legitimately saluting small-town America. ''(Sometimes after the salute, Archie Campbell would pronounce the saluted town spelled backwards.'' Example: ''\"Remember, 'Franklin' spelled backwards is 'Nil-knarf'.\"'')\n*'''The Joke Fence'''\u2014Two or three times during each show a cast member (usually a Hee Haw Honey), standing in front of a high wooden fence, would tell a [[one liner joke]]. ''(''Example'': \"I crossed an elephant with a gopher.\" Entire cast in unison: \"What'ja get?\" \"Some awfully big holes in the backyard.\")'' Regardless of whether the joke teller was female or male, a portion of the fence would swing upward and hit them on the rear end after the [[punch line]] was delivered.\n*'''Archie's Barber Shop'''\u2014Archie Campbell as the local barber, with regular customer Roy Clark, and two or three other regulars sitting in the \"waiting chairs\" (on some occasions Junior Samples or a guest star would be the one going into the barber's chair). Campbell would share comic dialog with Clark or tell one of his \"backwards fairy tales\" such as \"Rindercella.\"\n*'''Doc Campbell'''\u2014This long-running sketch featured Archie Campbell playing the part of a doctor who often gave out terrible advice and bizarre medical \"facts.\" Patients would often be one of the show's cast members. The sketch is also remembered for cast member Gunilla Hutton's role as Doc Campbell's assistant, Nurse Goodbody. In later seasons, the sketch featured only Doc Campbell and Nurse Goodbody, with the sketch beginning with Campbell shouting, \"Nurse Goodbody,\" to which she would hurry into the office, nervously answering \"Yes, Doctor,\" and gyrating her hips.\n*'''Justus O'Peace'''\u2014This sketch featured Archie Campbell as a judge who wore what looked to be a bowler hat, a red undershirt, and suspenders sentencing people to long jail time for some of the silliest misdemeanor \"crimes.\" Years later Archie's son, Phil Campbell, as well as Gordie Tapp, appeared in a recurring sketch about two police officers. They also did a courtroom sketch with Dub Taylor as the judge and Gailard Sartain in his role of Cletus Biggs from \"Biggs, Shy, and Stir.\"\n*'''\"Uh-huh, Oh Yeah!\"'''\u2014Cast member and banjo picker [[Buck Trent]] would recite a comical poem, [[talking blues]]-style (usually about chickens) to his banjo instrumental. At the end of the poem, Trent would go into a crescendo of \"Uh-huh\"'s and finish with a climactic \"Oh, yeah!\" In later seasons of the sketch, an animated critter would appear onscreen at the end of the sketch, carrying a sign that poked fun at the poem, to which Trent would then respond in a comical way.\n\n:''(\"Uh-huh, oh yeah!\" eventually became Trent's trademark phrase and he still says it in his shows, usually accompanied by a double [[thumbs-up]] gesture.)''\n\n*'''Hee Haw Dictionary'''\u2014Archie Campbell, dressed in a graduate's [[cap and gown]], would give the definition of a word with a comic twist. Sometimes wads of paper would fly into the scene as a way of punishing the bad joke that was told.\n*'''Gordie's General Store'''\u2014Gordie Tapp as the owner of a general merchandise store. It was also a place where one of the cast members (usually Junior Samples or Grandpa Jones) would tell a comedic story in early seasons. In later seasons, the focus shifted from Kornfield Kounty residents stopping by to the comedic banter of Tapp and Gailard Sartain, who played the role of Gordie's incompetent employee Maynard, who often would send Tapp into fits of anger or agony by the sketch's end.\n*'''Misty's Bedtime Stories'''\u2014This sketch featured bedtime stories delivered by cast member Misty Rowe. Grandpa Jones or George Lindsay would be heard off-screen introducing the sketch in a near-whisper, \"And now it's time for Misty's bedtime stories.\" A lit candle would be sitting on the night stand beside her bed and Rowe would deliver one of her bizarre stories, sometimes a rewritten nursery rhyme. By the sketch's end, she would deliver a humorous \"moral to the story,\" giggle, wink at the camera, and blow out the candle.\n*'''Empty Arms Hotel'''\u2014Roy Clark as the head desk clerk at one of the few accommodations in all of Kornfield Kounty, who would pop up from behind the front desk after the bell was rung, usually by a complaining guest.\n*'''Goober's Garage'''\u2014George Lindsay, in his [[The Andy Griffith Show|Andy Griffith]] role of Goober, as the owner of the local garage where he would talk about cars and jalopies with whomever appeared in the sketch that week. Sometimes non-cast member [[Jack Burns]] would appear in the sketch as the city slicker/con-artist type trying to pull a fast one with Goober emerging more intelligent. For a short time in the early 1980s, Chase Randolph appeared in the sketch as a muscular \"hunk\" mechanic hired by Goober and being pursued by Honeys Diana Goodman, Misty Rowe, and Nancy Traylor. The [[running gag]] of Randolph's run was that Randolph was more interested in fixing up cars than giving in to the advances of the girls, while Goober then offered to go out with the girls instead\u2014only for the girls to [[unrequited love|ignore his requests]] and appear disappointed. In later seasons, after Randolph's run, Goober was joined in the sketch by Goodman, Rowe, and Lisa Todd as his beautiful but not very bright mechanics.\n*'''The Farmer's Daughter'''\u2014Cast member Linda Thompson as the daughter of a strict farmer (cast member Kenny Price). The [[running gag]] in the sketch was that Price would always come up with clever ways to thwart Thompson's dates with her boyfriend Billy Bob.\n*'''The Weather Girl'''\u2014A spin-off of \"KORN News,\" where Hee Haw Honey Lisa Todd would spoof the weather forecast. Grandpa Jones appeared with Todd and she would determine the forecast according to the condition of Jones' knee. In later seasons, Gailard Sartain, wearing an inflated globe costume, accompanied Lisa as her human weather map.\n:''(In later seasons, \"KORN News\" and \"The Weather Girl\" merged into one sketch.)''\n*'''\"Hee Haw's All-Jug Band\"'''\u2014A musical sketch, featuring most of the female cast members, singing a comical song, in which the punch line differed each week. Cast member Lulu Roman \"played\" moonshine jugs (by which, she would blow air over the spout, creating a \"humming sound\"), which partially explains the sketch's title (as well as the fact that \"jugs\" is a [[dysphemism]] for breasts). Minnie Pearl introduced the sketch each week, loudly announcing, \"We're gonna play now!\" At the end of the song, she would similarly conclude \"We're through playin' now!\"\n*'''\"Hey Grandpa! What's for supper?\"'''\u2014Grandpa Jones is cleaning a window pane (with no glass in it, as evidenced by Jones' hand dangling through the window pane as he recites the menu) and when the entire cast (off-camera) asks, \"Hey, Grandpa, what's for supper,\" he recites a dinner menu in poetic verse. Often, he describes a delicious, country-style meal (e.g., chicken and biscuits smothered in rich gravy, and collard greens), and the cast would reply approvingly, \"yum-m yum-m!\" Sometimes he would serve a less than spectacular meal ''(thawed out [[TV dinner]]s)'', to which the cast would reply, \"yuck!\" One notable run-through of the routine had Grandpa saying \"Ah ain't got nuthin',\" which would be one of the few times he ever got booed during this routine. The second time was when he offered \"a big fresh roast of good [[moose]] meat.\"<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7aruSGi2Ts?t=7 Grandpa Jones booed]<sup>[Video Removed]</sup></ref>\n\n:''(This sketch went on [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] for a couple of seasons in the mid-70s, but returned near the end of the 70s and remained in the show until near the end of the series' run.)''\n\n*'''Grandpa and Minnie's Kitchen'''\u2014This sketch, which ran throughout most of the 1970s, spoofed TV cooking shows in which Grandpa Jones and Minnie Pearl would deliver hilarious recipes that made no sense.\n*'''JerryRalphRVBobBeavis'''\u2014This is a sketch that appeared mostly in the 1980s and it featured Gailard Sartain as the owner of a small store/flea market attempting to sell junk. The sketch would start with a hand-held camera zooming up to the front door and the door being flung open to reveal the fast-talking salesman standing behind the counter surrounded by the junk he was trying to sell. The character was a clown with red cheeks, and wild, clown-like hair. The running joke was his attempts at becoming a big singing star; and at the end of every sketch, just as he's preparing to pull out a guitar and starts to sing, the camera would zoom out and the door would swing shut.\n*'''Biggs, Shy, & Stir'''\u2014This featured Gailard Sartain as \"Cletus Biggs of Biggs, Shy, & Stir,\" Kornfield Kounty's most honorable law firm, where our motto is, 'When in doubt, sue!'\" He would advertise the week's \"special\" such as \"Sue Your Parents Week\" or \"Sue Your Teacher Week,\" etc. He always concluded the sketch by saying, \"Remember, we're in the alley behind the courthouse above the pool hall!\"\n*'''The Cornfield'''\u2014Vignettes patterned after ''Laugh-In's'' \"Joke Wall,\" with cast members and guest stars \"popping up\" to tell jokes and one-liners. Until his death, Stringbean played the field's scarecrow, delivering one-liners before being shouted down by the crow on his shoulder; after his 1973 murder, Stringbean was not replaced; and a wooden scarecrow was simply seen in the field as a memorial. Guest stars often participated in this sketch as well; and on occasion, personalities from TV stations that carried ''Hee Haw'', as well as country music radio personalities, would appear in this sketch with Owens or Clark.\n*'''The Naggers'''\u2014This sketch featured Gordie Tapp and Roni Stoneman as LaVern and Ida Lee Nagger, a backwoods bickering couple, inspired in part by the radio comedy ''[[The Bickersons]]''. Kenny Price made occasional appearances ''(starting in 1974)'' as their son Elrod; and Wendy Suits of the show's background singing group The Nashville Edition would sometimes play Ida Lee's equally (and deaf) nagging mother.\n*'''Kornfield Kounty Operator Assistance'''\u2014Irlene Mandrell as Kornfield Kounty's telephone operator (similar to Lily Tomlin's more famous character, Ernestine Tomlin) would answer phone calls from various Kornfield Kounty residents, who would eventually hang up in various degrees of frustration, causing operator Mandrell to often say, innocently, \"And they wonder why we telephone operators turn gray!\"\n*'''Grinder's Switch Gazzette'''\u2014This sketch featured Minnie Pearl as the manager of the local newspaper who often insisted that her mute secretary, Miss Honeydew (Victoria Hallman), take down an \"important\" news item which was always nonsense.\n*'''About 200 Years Ago'''\u2014This sketch, which ran in 1976 in celebration of the Bicentennial year, was a parody of CBS' \"[[Bicentennial Minutes]]\"; in the sketch, Grandpa Jones would deliver a fractured historical \"fact\" about the [[American Revolution|Revolutionary]] era. Jones then concluded the sketch with a knockoff of [[Walter Cronkite]]'s signature sign-off line, \"I'm Grandpa Jones and that's the way it was, 200 years ago ... er, more or less.\"\n*'''The Almanac'''\u2014A sketch that ran in the late 1970s where Grandpa Jones would deliver [[almanac]] entries that made no sense. Jones then concluded the sketch with a knockoff of the proverb \"[[truth is stranger than fiction]],\" with Jones replacing the word \"fiction\" with the name of a well-known celebrity.\n*'''Archie's Angels'''\u2014Aired in the mid-1970s, this sketch was ''Hee Haw's'' knockoff of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', the popular TV crime show from that period. Three of the Honeys portrayed the Angels, with Archie Campbell's voice giving them humorous \"assignments\" over an intercom, as was with the actual ''Charlie's Angels'' TV show.\n*'''\"Let's Truck Together\"'''\u2014This sketch reflected the [[Citizens Band radio|CB radio]] craze during the mid-to-late 1970s. Kenny Price and Gailard Sartain, as truck drivers, would swap funny stories and one-liners with each other over the CB airwaves.\n*'''Hee Haw Honky Tonk'''\u2014With the [[Urban Cowboy]] craze in full swing in the early 1980s, ''Hee Haw'' answered with its very own Urban Cowboy-esque [[honky-tonk]]. (Even Buck Owens developed an Urban Cowboy look by growing a beard and donning a [[cowboy hat]] and kept this image for the next several seasons.) The sketch was a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of \"Pickin' and Grinnin',\" with cast members, as patrons of the honky-tonk, throwing out one-liners between parts of the \"Hee Haw Honky Tonk\" song. The Honky Tonk was replete with its [[mechanical bull]] and also included a background conversation track during the one-liners to add to the realism of an actual nightclub. The sketch also at times featured Roni Stoneman, in her role of Ida Lee Nagger, chasing men with a net. The sketch was also patterned after the Party on ''Laugh-In''. The \"Hee Haw Honky Tonk\" set also became the main stage for most of the musical performances for the rest of the series' run.\n*'''Kurl Up and Dye'''\u2014This is a sketch from its later years which featured several of the cast members in a beauty parlor where they would gossip. From time to time, Gailard Sartain would appear in [[drag queen|drag]] as one of the fussy women.\n*'''Fit as a Fiddle'''\u2014This sketch ran in the 1980s to reflect the [[Aerobics|aerobic]] dancing craze of that period. The sketch featured several of the female cast members including Diana Goodman, Victoria Hallman, Gunilla Hutton, Misty Rowe, and Nancy Traylor, delivering one-liner jokes while aerobic dancing. Sometimes cast member Jeff Smith would be seen on an exercise cycle in the background.\n*'''Slim Pickens' Bar-B-Q'''\u2014[[Slim Pickens]] would have his friends over at a barbecue at his home, where a musical guest would perform. The segment would always open up spoofing Burma-Shave road signs as some of the cast members were seen piled on a truck driving down the road to Slim Pickens' Bar-B-Q, whose guests often complained about the food, to which Pickens would counter with something like \"I may not have prime meat at this picnic, but I do have prime entertainment!\" And then he'd bring out the entertainment (the guest star's performance).\n*'''The Post Office'''\u2014Minnie Pearl and Grandpa Jones ran the post office, who often dealt with (mostly) unhappy customers.\n*'''The Quilt'''\u2014Minnie Pearl gave romantic advice to several of the Hee Haw Honeys while sitting around in a circle, making a [[quilt]].\n*'''Knock Knock'''\u2014Buck Owens told a [[knock-knock joke]] to an unsuspecting cast member or guest star. If the guest star was a major country artist, the joke would be written to reveal the punch-line answer to be the title to one of the singer's biggest hits, which Owens would then sing badly, on purpose.\n*'''The Hambone Brothers'''\u2014Jackie Phelps doing some rhythmic knee-slapping (known as [[hambone (dance)|hambone]]) while [[Jimmy Riddle]] [[eefing|eefed]].\n*'''Stories from [[John Henry Faulk]] and [[Grady Nutt|Rev. Grady Nutt]]'''\u2014Beginning in the late 1970s, John Henry Faulk, followed in later seasons by Rev. Grady Nutt, would sit around in a circle with some of the male cast members on the set of Gordie's General Store telling some of their humorous stories (very much in the same manner Grandpa Jones and Junior Samples did in early seasons). At the beginning of Grady Nutt's sketches, Grandpa Jones would introduce Nutt as \"Hee Haw's very own Prime Minister of Humor.\" These sketches discontinued after Nutt's death in a plane crash in 1982.\n*'''Ben Colder'''\u2014A singer of cheesy parodies of popular country songs. [[Sheb Wooley]] had created the character before the show began and portrayed the character during his time on the show and his guest appearances.\n*'''The Little Yellow Chicken'''\u2014An animated little yellow chicken who would always mistake anything and everything for an egg. The chicken would sit on items, such as a ringside bell, a man's bald head, a billiard ball, a football, a golf ball and even a bomb, with various disastrous results. The little chicken was produced by Format Films.\n*'''Animated Critters'''\u2014Interspersed within the show, besides the above-mentioned chicken, were various applauding or laughing animated farm animals; a kickline composed of pigs during an instrumental performance; a pack of dogs that would chase an extremely bad joke teller; three sultry pigs that twirled their necklaces during an instrumental performance; a square dancing female pig and a male donkey to an instrumental performance; a pair of chickens dancing, with one of them falling flat on its face; the ubiquitous Hee Haw Donkey, who would say quips such as, \"Wouldn't that dunk your hat in the creek,\" and a pig (from the kickline) that would sneak up on a musical guest (or a cast member, mostly Roy Clark) and kiss him on the cheek after his performance. Sometimes, certain animals would carry appropriate signs with some kind of quip (e.g. Hee Haw Donkey holding a sign that would say, \"I'm looking for a \"She-Haw!\" or in later years, \"Let us Bray!\" Also, a pig from the kickline holding a sign which would say, \"Oink\", \"Down with Ham and Eggs\", or \"Please DON'T Bring Home the Bacon!\" A skunk would take his nose off and dribble it like a basketball before putting it back on while holding a sign which reads \"Welcome to Smell-a-vision\", a duck with a sign which usually reads \"Eat Quacker Oats\", or a cow coming into the scene and opening a sign that would say something like \"Stop Beefing!\" or \"I married a Bum Steer\"). The animation was produced by [[Format Films]].\n\nGuest stars often participated in some of the sketches (mostly the \"PFFT! You Was Gone\" and \"The Cornfield\" sketches); however, this did not occur until later seasons.\n\n==Musical legacy==\n''Hee Haw'' featured a premiere showcase on commercial television throughout its run for [[Country music|country]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[Gospel music|gospel]], and other styles of American traditional music, featuring hundreds of elite musical performances that were paramount to the success, popularity and legacy of the series for a broad audience of [[Southern United States|Southern]], rural and purely music fans alike. Although country music was the primary genre of music featured on the show, guest stars and cast members alike also performed music from other genres, such as [[oldies]], [[big band]], and [[pop standard]]s.\n\nSome of the music-based segments on the show (other than guest stars' performances) included:\n*'''The [[Million Dollar Band (country music group)|Million Dollar Band]]'''\u2014This was an instrumental band formed of legendary [[Nashville sound|Nashville]] musicians [[Chet Atkins]] ([[guitar]]), [[Boots Randolph]] ([[saxophone]]), Roy Clark (guitar), [[Floyd Cramer]] ([[piano]]), [[Charlie McCoy]] ([[harmonica]]), [[Danny Davis (country musician)|Danny Davis]] ([[trumpet]]), [[Jethro Burns]] ([[mandolin]]), and [[Johnny Gimble]] ([[violin|fiddle]]); who would frequently appear on the show from 1980 through 1988. The band would perform an instrumental version of a popular song, with each member showcasing his talent on his respective instrument.\n*'''The Hee Haw Gospel Quartet''' - Beginning in the late 1970s, the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet--formed of Clark, Owens, Grandpa Jones, and Kenny Price--would sing a gospel hymn at the end of the show's last segment. In the first few seasons that featured the Quartet, cast member Lulu Roman would always introduce the group along with the hymn they were about to perform; in later seasons, the group would simply begin their hymn with the name of the group superimposed over the screenshot for the first few seconds. Several of the Quartet's performances were released as recordings. Joe Babcock took over as lead singer after Owens left the show, and Ray Burdette took over as bass singer after the death of Kenny Price; but the Quartet was not featured as often from that point on. However, the show still closed with a gospel song\u2014if not by the Quartet, then by either the entire cast, a guest gospel artist, or cast member Lulu Roman (a gospel artist in her own right).\n*'''[[Hager Twins|The Hagers]]''' - This twin brother singing duo would also perform a song each week on the show.\n*'''Performances by cast members''' - In addition to hosts Buck Owens and Roy Clark, who would perform at least one song each week, other cast members\u2014such as Gunilla Hutton, Misty Rowe, Victoria Hallman, Grandpa Jones (sometimes with his wife [[Ramona Jones|Ramona]]), Kenny Price, Archie Campbell, Barbi Benton, The Nashville Edition, Vicki Bird, and Diana Goodman\u2014would occasionally perform a song on the show; and the show would almost always open with a song performed by the entire cast.\n*'''The Hee Haw Cowboy Quartet''' - This group, patterned after the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet, was short-lived, having formed near the end of the series' run. Like the group name suggests; the quartet, dressed in [[cowboy]] costumes, would perform a [[Western music (North America)|western song]] in the style of the [[Sons of the Pioneers]] on a [[American Old West|western]]-style stage setting.\n*'''[[Clogging|Cloggers]]''' - Throughout the 1980s, several champion clogging groups would frequently appear on the show, performing their clogging routines.\n*'''[[Child singer]]s''' - For a brief time in the early 1980s, child singers, mostly in the 10 to 12-year-old bracket, would occasionally appear on the show performing a popular song. Such guests included Kathy Kitchen (whom guest star [[Faron Young]] introduced), Stacy Lynn Ries, and Cheryl Handy.\n\nLovullo also has made the claim the show presented \"what were, in reality, the first musical videos.\"<ref name=\"Lovullo\">Lovullo, Sam, and Mark Eliot, \"Life in the Kornfield: My 25 Years at ''Hee Haw'',\" Boulevard Books, New York, 1996, p. 34. {{ISBN|1-57297-028-6}}</ref> Lovullo said his videos were conceptualized by having the show's staff go to nearby rural areas and film animals and farmers, before editing the footage to fit the storyline of a particular song. \"The video material was a very workable production item for the show,\" he wrote. \"It provided picture stories for songs. However, some of our guests felt the videos took attention away from their live performances, which they hoped would promote record sales. If they had a hit song, they didn't want to play it under comic barnyard footage.\" The concept's mixed reaction eventually spelled an end to the \"video\" concept on ''Hee Haw''.<ref name=\"Lovullo\"/> However, several of co-host Owens' songs \u2013 including \"Tall, Dark Stranger,\" \"Big in Vegas\", and \"I Wouldn't Live in New York City (If They Gave Me the Whole Dang Town)\" \u2013 aired on the series and have since aired on [[Great American Country]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]] as part of their classic country music programming blocks.\n\n===Guest stars===\n''Hee Haw'' featured at least two, and sometimes three or four, guest celebrities each week. While most of the guest stars were country music artists, a wide range of other famous luminaries were featured from actors and actresses to sports stars to politicians.\n\n[[Sheb Wooley]], one of the original cast members, wrote the show's theme song. After filming the initial 13 episodes, other professional demands caused him to leave the show, but he returned from time to time as a guest.\n\n[[Loretta Lynn]] was the first guest star of ''Hee Haw'' and made more guest appearances (24) than any other artist. She also co-hosted the show more than any other guest co-host and therefore appears on more of the DVD releases for retail sale than any other guest star. Tammy Wynette was second with 21 guest appearances.Tammy Wynette married George Richey (the musical director for Hee Haw from 1970 to 1977) in 1978.\n\nFrom 1990\u201392, country megastar [[Garth Brooks]] appeared on the show four times. In 1992, producer Sam Lovullo tried unsuccessfully to contact Brooks because he wanted him for the final show. Brooks then surprised Lovullo by showing up at the last minute, ready to don his overalls and perform for the final episode.<ref>Martin, Jeff [http://thislandpress.com/01/15/2011/return-to-kornfield-kounty-why-hee-haw-still-matters/], ''This Land'', January 2011, accessed July 6, 2011.</ref>\n\n===Stage settings===\nA barn interior set was used as the main stage for most of the musical performances from the show's premiere until the debut of the \"Hee Haw Honky Tonk\" sketch in the early 1980s. Afterwards, the \"Hee Haw Honky Tonk\" set would serve as the main stage for the remainder of the series' run. Buck Owens then began using the barn interior set for his performances after it was replaced by the \"Hee Haw Honky Tonk\" set and was named \"Buck's Place\" (as a nod to one of Owens' hits, \"[[Sam's Place]]\"). Other settings for the musical performances throughout the series' run included a haystack (where the entire cast performed songs), the living room of a [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] house, the front porch and lawn of the Samuel B. Sternwheeler home, a [[grist mill]] (where Roy Clark performed many of his songs in earlier seasons), and a railroad [[railroad station|depot]], where Buck Owens performed his songs before acquiring \"Buck's Place.\"\n\n===Elvis connection===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n[[Elvis Presley]] was a fan of ''Hee Haw'' and wanted to appear as a guest on the program, but Presley was afraid that his manager, [[Colonel Tom Parker]], would not allow him to do so. Two of the Hee Haw Honeys dated Presley long before they joined the cast, Linda Thompson in the mid-1970s, whom Presley had a long-term relationship with after his divorce from [[Priscilla Presley|Priscilla]]; and Diana Goodman shortly afterwards. Shortly after Presley's death, his father, [[Vernon Presley]], made a cameo appearance on the show, alongside Thompson and Buck Owens, and paid tribute to his late son, noting how much Elvis enjoyed watching the show, and introduced one of his favorite gospel songs, as performed by the Hee Haw Gospel Quartet.\n\n==''Hee Haw Honeys'' (spin-off series)==\n''Hee Haw'' produced a short-lived [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''Hee Haw Honeys'' (not to be confused with ''Hee Haw's'' female cast members), for the 1978\u201379 television seasons. This musical sitcom starred [[Kathie Lee Gifford|Kathie Lee Johnson (Gifford)]] along with ''Hee Haw'' regulars Misty Rowe, Gailard Sartain, Lulu Roman, and Kenny Price as a family who owned a [[truck stop]] restaurant (likely inspired by the \"Lulu's Truck Stop\" sketch on ''Hee Haw''). Their restaurant included a [[bandstand]], where guest country artists would perform a couple of their hits of the day, sometimes asking the cast to join them.<ref>{{cite book|title=[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946-Present]]|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8}}</ref> Cast members would also perform songs occasionally; and the Nashville Edition, ''Hee Haw's'' backup singing group, frequently appeared on the show, portraying regular patrons of the restaurant. Notable guest stars on ''Honeys'' included, but were not limited to: [[Loretta Lynn]], [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], [[Larry Gatlin]], [[Dave & Sugar]], and [[the Kendalls]].\n\n==Hee Haw Theater==\nThe '''Hee Haw Theater''' opened in [[Branson, Missouri]], in 1981 and operated through 1983. It featured live shows using the cast of the television series, as well as guests and other talent. The format was similar with a country variety show-type family theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/HeeHawTheater/info?tab=overview|title=Hee Haw Theater|author=|date=|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>\n\n==Comic book adaptations==\n[[Charlton Comics]] also published humor comics based on ''Hee Haw''.<ref>https://www.comics.org/issue/170310/</ref> They were drawn by [[Frank Roberge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lambiek.net/artists/r/roberge_frank.htm|title=Frank Roberge|author=|date=|website=lambiek.net}}</ref>\n\n==Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

In spite of the popularity among its fans, the program has never been a favorite of [[television criticism|television critics]] or [[review]]ers; the ''Hee Haw Honeys'' spin-off, in particular, was cited in a 2002 ''[[TV Guide]]'' article as one of the ten [[List of television series considered the worst|worst television series ever]].\n\nOn at least four episodes of the animated Fox series ''[[Family Guy]]'', when the storyline hits a dead-end, a cutaway to [[Conway Twitty]] performing a song is inserted. The handoff is done in ''Hee Haw'' style, and often uses actual footage of Twitty performing on the show.\n\nLulu Roman released a new album titled ''At Last'' on January 15, 2013. The album features Lulu's versions of 12 classics and standards including guest appearances by [[Dolly Parton]], T. Graham Brown, Linda Davis, and [[Georgette Jones]] (daughter of [[George Jones]] and [[Tammy Wynette]]).<ref>{{cite web |author = Record Label |date = December 7, 2012 |url=http://www.homesickent.com/projects.html |title = Homesick Entertainment Projects |publisher = [[Homesick Entertainment]] |accessdate = December 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|group=notes}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Official website|www.heehaw.com}}\n*[http://www.tv.com/shows/hee-haw/episodes/ Episode Guide and guest appearance list at TV.com]\n*[http://www.rfdtv.com/Press/Releases/HTML/Hee_Haw.asp ''Hee Haw'' on RFD-TV]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0063908|title=Hee Haw}}\n*{{tv.com show|hee-haw|Hee Haw}}\n*[http://www.rissystreasures.com/heehaw/ Risa's Hee Haw Tribute Page]\n*[http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/1366855-effen-hambone Riddle & Phelps place third in TV Greats Countdown]\n*[http://www.voicesofoklahoma.com/interview/clark-roy/ Voices of Oklahoma interview with Roy Clark.] First person interview conducted on August 15, 2011, with Roy Clark, star of Hee Haw.\n*[https://www.flickr.com/photos/juniordugan/sets/72157628751741745/?ytcheck=1 Photos from Hee-Haw Theater in Branson]\n\n[[Category:1969 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1997 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1960s American sketch comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1970s American sketch comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American sketch comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sketch comedy television series]]\n[[Category:1960s American variety television series]]\n[[Category:1970s American variety television series]]\n[[Category:1980s American variety television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American variety television series]]\n[[Category:American country music]]\n[[Category:Bluegrass music]]\n[[Category:CBS network shows]]\n[[Category:Country music television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Rural society in the United States]]\n[[Category:Television series by Fremantle (company)]]\n[[Category:Television programs adapted into plays]]\n[[Category:Television programs adapted into comics]]\n[[Category:1970s American television series]]\n[[Category:American television series with live action and animation]]", "sha1": "klyk71ldt35xazhwrbytwvzx5vc730m"}}, {"title": "Hexadecimal", "ns": "0", "id": "13263", "revision": {"id": "866201304", "parentid": "866199398", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T22:49:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "MarkZusab", "id": "30109901"}, "comment": "/* See also */ added link to [[IBM hexadecimal floating point]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{redirect|Sexadecimal|base 60|Sexagesimal}}\n{{Numeral systems}}\nIn [[mathematics]] and [[computing]], '''hexadecimal''' (also '''[[Radix|base]] {{num|16}}''', or '''hex''') is a [[positional notation|positional]] [[numeral system]] with a [[radix]], or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols '''0'''\u2013'''9''' to represent values zero to nine, and '''A'''\u2013'''F''' (or alternatively '''a'''\u2013'''f''') to represent values ten to fifteen.<!--YES, NOT SIXTEEN. The largest digit in base sixteen represents fifteen, just as the largest digit in base ten represents nine.-->\n\nHexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer system designers and programmers, as they provide a more human-friendly representation of [[binary code|binary-coded]] values. Each hexadecimal digit represents four [[bit|binary digits]], also known as a [[nibble]], which is half a [[byte]]. For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 0000 0000 to 1111 1111 in binary form, which can be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.\n\nIn mathematics, a subscript is typically used to specify the [[radix]].  For example the decimal value {{val|10995|fmt=commas}} would be expressed in hexadecimal as {{hexadecimal|10995}}.  In programming, a number of notations are used to support hexadecimal representation, usually involving a prefix or suffix.  The prefix <code>0x</code> is used in [[C (programming language)|C]] and related languages, which would denote this value by 0x{{hexadecimal|10995|no}}.\n\nHexadecimal is used in the transfer encoding '''Base16''', in which each byte of the plaintext is broken into two 4-bit values and represented by two hexadecimal digits.\n\n==Representation==\n\n===Written representation===\n\n====Using 0\u20139 and A\u2013F====\n{{Hexadecimal table}}\nIn contexts where the [[radix|base]] is not clear, hexadecimal numbers can be ambiguous and confused with numbers expressed in other bases. There are several conventions for expressing values unambiguously. A numerical subscript (itself written in decimal) can give the base explicitly: 159<sub>10</sub> is decimal 159; 159<sub>16</sub> is hexadecimal 159, which is equal to 345<sub>10</sub>. Some authors prefer a text subscript, such as 159<sub>decimal</sub> and 159<sub>hex</sub>, or 159<sub>d</sub> and 159<sub>h</sub>.\n\nIn linear text systems, such as those used in most computer programming environments, a variety of methods have arisen:<!--\n * * * These are ordered from most likely to be encountered by lay people\n * * * to least likely to be encountered by lay people\n * * * -->\n* In [[URI]]s (including [[URL]]s), [[character encoding|character codes]] are written as hexadecimal pairs prefixed with <code>%</code>: <code><nowiki>http://www.example.com/name%20with%20spaces</nowiki></code> where <code>%20</code> is the [[Space (punctuation)#Space characters and digital typography|space (blank)]] character, [[ASCII]] code point 20 in hex, 32 in decimal.\n* In [[XML]] and [[XHTML]], characters can be expressed as hexadecimal [[numeric character reference]]s using the notation <code>&amp;#x''code'';</code>, where the ''x'' denotes that ''code'' is a hex code point (of 1- to 6-digits) assigned to the character in the [[Unicode]] standard. Thus <code>&amp;#x2019;</code> represents the right single quotation mark (\u2019), Unicode code point number 2019 in hex, 8217 (thus <code>&amp;#8217;</code> in decimal).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2000.pdf|title=The Unicode Standard, Version 7|last=|first=|date=|website=Unicode|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 28, 2018}}</ref>\n* In the [[Unicode]] standard, a character value is represented with <code>U+</code> followed by the hex value, e.g. <code>U+20AC</code> is the [[Euro sign]] (\u20ac).\n* [[Web colors|Color references]] in HTML, [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and [[X window system|X Window]] can be expressed with six hexadecimal digits (two each for the red, green and blue components, in that order) prefixed with <code>#</code>: white, for example, is represented <code>#FFFFFF</code>.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.web-colors-explained.com/hex.php |title=Hexadecimal web colors explained}}</ref> CSS allows 3-hexdigit abbreviations with one hexdigit per component: #FA3 abbreviates #FFAA33 (a golden orange: {{color box|#FA3}}).\n* {{anchor|_nix}}[[*nix|Unix]] (and related) shells, [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] assembly language and likewise the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] (and its syntactic descendants such as [[C++]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[JavaScript]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Windows PowerShell]]) use the prefix <code>0x</code> for numeric constants represented in hex: <code>0x5A3</code>. Character and string constants may express character codes in hexadecimal with the prefix <code>\\x</code> followed by two hex digits: <code>'\\x1B'</code> represents the [[Escape character|Esc]] control character; <code>\"\\x1B[0m\\x1B[25;1H\"</code> is a string containing 11 characters (plus a trailing NUL to mark the end of the string) with two embedded Esc characters.<ref>The string <code>\"\\x1B[0m\\x1B[25;1H\"</code> specifies the character sequence <tt>Esc [ 0 m Esc [ 2 5 ; 1 H Nul</tt>. These are the escape sequences used on an [[ANSI escape code|ANSI terminal]] that reset the character set and color, and then move the cursor to line 25.</ref> To output an integer as hexadecimal with the [[printf]] function family, the format conversion code <code>%X</code> or <code>%x</code> is used.\n* In [[MIME]] (e-mail extensions) [[quoted-printable]] encoding, characters that cannot be represented as literal [[ASCII]] characters are represented by their codes as two hexadecimal digits (in ASCII) prefixed by an ''equal to'' sign <code>=</code>, as in <code>Espa=F1a</code> to send \"Espa\u00f1a\" (Spain). (Hexadecimal F1, equal to decimal 241, is the code number for the lower case n with tilde in the ISO/IEC 8859-1 character set.)\n* In Intel-derived [[assembly language]]s and Modula-2,<ref>{{cite web |title=Modula-2 - Vocabulary and representation |url=http://modula2.org/reference/vocabulary.php |website=Modula -2 |access-date=1 November 2015}}</ref> hexadecimal is denoted with a suffixed <tt>H</tt> or <tt>h</tt>: <code>FFh</code> or <code>05A3H</code>. Some implementations require a leading zero when the first hexadecimal digit character is not a decimal digit, so one would write <code>0FFh</code> instead of <code>FFh</code>\n* Other assembly languages ([[MOS Technology 6502|6502]], [[Motorola]]), [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], some versions of [[BASIC]] ([[Commodore BASIC|Commodore]]), [[GameMaker Studio|GameMaker Language]], [[Godot (game engine)|Godot]] and [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] use <code>$</code> as a prefix: <code>$5A3</code>.\n* Some assembly languages (Microchip) use the notation <code>H'ABCD'</code> (for ABCD<sub>16</sub>). Similarly, [[Fortran 95 language features|Fortran 95]] uses Z'ABCD'.\n* [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] and [[VHDL]] enclose hexadecimal numerals in based \"numeric quotes\": <code>16#5A3#</code>. For bit vector constants [[VHDL]] uses the notation <code>x\"5A3\"</code>.<ref>The [http://www.eng.auburn.edu/department/ee/mgc/vhdl.html#numbers VHDL MINI-REFERENCE: VHDL IDENTIFIERS, NUMBERS, STRINGS, AND EXPRESSIONS]</ref>\n* [[Verilog]] represents hexadecimal constants in the form <code>8'hFF</code>, where 8 is the number of bits in the value and FF is the hexadecimal constant.\n* The [[Smalltalk]] language uses the prefix <code>16r</code>: <code>16r5A3</code>\n* [[PostScript]] and the [[Bourne shell]] and its derivatives denote hex with prefix <code>16#</code>: <code>16#5A3</code>. For PostScript, binary data (such as image [[pixel]]s) can be expressed as unprefixed consecutive hexadecimal pairs: <code>AA213FD51B3801043FBC</code>...\n* [[Common Lisp]] uses the prefixes <code>#x</code> and <code>#16r</code>. Setting the variables *read-base*<ref>{{cite web |title=*read-base* variable in Common Lisp |url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_rd_bas.htm}}</ref> and *print-base*<ref>{{cite web |title=*print-base* variable in Common Lisp |url=http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Body/v_pr_bas.htm#STprint-baseST}}</ref> to 16 can also be used to switch the reader and printer of a Common Lisp system to Hexadecimal number representation for reading and printing numbers. Thus Hexadecimal numbers can be represented without the #x or #16r prefix code, when the input or output base has been changed to 16.\n* [[MSX BASIC]],<ref>[http://www.atarimagazines.com/compute/issue56/107_1_MSX_IS_COMING.php MSX is Coming \u2014 Part 2: Inside MSX] [[Compute!]], issue 56, January 1985, p. 52</ref> [[QuickBASIC]], [[FreeBASIC]] and [[Visual Basic]] prefix hexadecimal numbers with <code>&amp;H</code>: <code>&amp;H5A3</code>\n* [[BBC BASIC]] and [[Locomotive BASIC]] use <code>&amp;</code> for hex.<ref>BBC BASIC programs are not fully portable to [[Microsoft BASIC]] (without modification) since the latter takes <code>&amp;</code> to prefix [[octal]] values.

Binary, quaternary (base-4) and octal numbers can be specified similarly.\n* The most common format for hexadecimal on IBM mainframes ([[zSeries]]) and midrange computers ([[IBM System i]]) running the traditional OS's ([[z/OS|zOS]], [[VSE (operating system)|zVSE]], [[z/VM|zVM]], [[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]], [[IBM i]]) is <code>X'5A3'</code>, and is used in Assembler, [[PL/I]], [[COBOL]], [[Job Control Language|JCL]], scripts, commands and other places. This format was common on other (and now obsolete) IBM systems as well.

Clarke]] suggested using each finger as an on/off bit, allowing finger counting from zero to 1023<sub>10</sub> on ten fingers.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} Another system for counting up to FF<sub>16</sub> (255<sub>10</sub>) is illustrated on the right.\n\n===Signs===\nThe hexadecimal system can express negative numbers the same way as in decimal: \u22122A to represent \u221242<sub>10</sub> and so on.\n\nHexadecimal can also be used to express the exact bit patterns used in the [[central processing unit|processor]], so a sequence of hexadecimal digits may represent a [[signedness|signed]] or even a [[floating point]] value. This way, the negative number \u221242<sub>10</sub> can be written as FFFF&nbsp;FFD6 in a 32-bit [[Processor register|CPU register]] (in [[two's-complement]]), as C228&nbsp;0000 in a 32-bit [[Floating point unit|FPU]] register or C045&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0000&nbsp;0000 in a 64-bit FPU register (in the [[IEEE floating-point standard]]).\n\n===Hexadecimal exponential notation===\nJust as decimal numbers can be represented in [[exponential notation]], so too can hexadecimal numbers.  By convention, the letter ''P'' (or ''p'', for \"power\") represents ''times two raised to the power of'', whereas ''E'' (or ''e'') serves a similar purpose in decimal as part of the [[E notation]].  The number after the ''P'' is ''decimal'' and represents the ''binary'' exponent.\n\nUsually the number is normalised so that the leading hexadecimal digit is 1 (unless the value is exactly 0).\n\nExample: 1.3DEp42 represents {{math|1.3DE<sub>16</sub>\u2009\u00d7\u20092<sup>42</sup>}}.\n\nHexadecimal exponential notation is required by the [[IEEE 754-2008]] binary floating-point standard.\nThis notation can be used for floating-point literals in the [[C99]] edition of the [[C (programming_language)|C programming language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=29237 |title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 - Programming languages - C |publisher=Iso.org |date=2011-12-08 |accessdate=2014-04-08}}</ref>\nUsing the ''%a'' or ''%A'' conversion specifiers, this notation can be produced by implementations of the ''[[printf]]'' family of functions following the C99 specification<ref name=\"Rationale_2003_C\">{{cite web |title=Rationale for International Standard - Programming Languages - C |version=5.10 |date=April 2003 |pages=52, 153\u2013154, 159 |url=http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf |access-date=2010-10-17 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606072228/http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/C99RationaleV5.10.pdf |archive-date=2016-06-06}}</ref> and\n[[Single UNIX Specification|Single Unix Specification]] (IEEE Std 1003.1) [[POSIX]] standard.<ref name=\"printf_2013\">{{cite web |title=dprintf, fprintf, printf, snprintf, sprintf - print formatted output |work=The Open Group Base Specifications |edition=Issue 7, IEEE Std 1003.1, 2013 |date=2013 |orig-year=2001 |author=The IEEE and The Open Group |url=http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html |access-date=2016-06-21 |dead-url=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621211105/http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/printf.html |archive-date=2016-06-21}}</ref>\n\n==Conversion==\n\n===Binary conversion===\nMost computers manipulate binary data, but it is difficult for humans to work with the large number of digits for even a relatively small binary number. Although most humans are familiar with the base 10 system, it is much easier to map binary to hexadecimal than to decimal because each hexadecimal digit maps to a whole number of bits (4<sub>10</sub>).\nThis example converts 1111<sub>2</sub> to base ten. Since each [[Positional notation|position]] in a binary numeral can contain either a 1 or a 0, its value may be easily determined by its position from the right:\n* 0001<sub>2</sub> = 1<sub>10</sub>\n* 0010<sub>2</sub> = 2<sub>10</sub>\n* 0100<sub>2</sub> = 4<sub>10</sub>\n* 1000<sub>2</sub> = 8<sub>10</sub>\nTherefore:\n{|\n|-\n| 1111<sub>2</sub>|| = 8<sub>10</sub> + 4<sub>10</sub> + 2<sub>10</sub> + 1<sub>10</sub>\n|-\n| &nbsp;|| = 15<sub>10</sub>\n|}\nWith little practice, mapping 1111<sub>2</sub> to F<sub>16</sub> in one step becomes easy: see table in [[#Written representation|Written representation]]. The advantage of using hexadecimal rather than decimal increases rapidly with the size of the number. When the number becomes large, conversion to decimal is very tedious. However, when mapping to hexadecimal, it is trivial to regard the binary string as 4-digit groups and map each to a single hexadecimal digit.\n\nThis example shows the conversion of a binary number to decimal, mapping each digit to the decimal value, and adding the results.\n{|\n| (01011110101101010010)<sub>2</sub>|| = 262144<sub>10</sub> + 65536<sub>10</sub> + 32768<sub>10</sub> + 16384<sub>10</sub> + 8192<sub>10</sub> + 2048<sub>10</sub> + 512<sub>10</sub> + 256<sub>10</sub> + 64<sub>10</sub> + 16<sub>10</sub> + 2<sub>10</sub>\n|-\n| &nbsp;|| = 387922<sub>10</sub>\n|}\nCompare this to the conversion to hexadecimal, where each group of four digits can be considered independently, and converted directly:\n{|\n|-\n| (01011110101101010010)<sub>2</sub>|| = ||0101<sub>&nbsp;</sub>||1110<sub>&nbsp;</sub>||1011<sub>&nbsp;</sub>||0101<sub>&nbsp;</sub>||0010<sub>2</sub>\n|-\n| &nbsp;|| = || align=\"center\" |5|| align=\"center\" |E|| align=\"center\" |B|| align=\"center\" |5|| align=\"center\" |2<sub>16</sub>\n|-\n| &nbsp;|| = || colspan=\"5\" |5EB52<sub>16</sub>\n|}\nThe conversion from hexadecimal to binary is equally direct.\n\n===Other simple conversions===\n\nAlthough [[Quaternary numeral system|quaternary]] (base 4) is little used, it can easily be converted to and from hexadecimal or binary. Each hexadecimal digit corresponds to a pair of quaternary digits and each quaternary digit corresponds to a pair of binary digits. In the above example 5&nbsp;E&nbsp;B&nbsp;5&nbsp;2<sub>16</sub> = 11&nbsp;32&nbsp;23&nbsp;11&nbsp;02<sub>4</sub>.\n\nThe [[octal]] (base 8) system can also be converted with relative ease, although not quite as trivially as with bases 2 and 4. Each octal digit corresponds to three binary digits, rather than four. Therefore we can convert between octal and hexadecimal via an intermediate conversion to binary followed by regrouping the binary digits in groups of either three or four.\n\n===Division-remainder in source base===\nAs with all bases there is a simple [[algorithm]] for converting a representation of a number to hexadecimal by doing integer division and remainder operations in the source base. In theory, this is possible from any base, but for most humans only decimal and for most computers only binary (which can be converted by far more efficient methods) can be easily handled with this method.\n\nLet d be the number to represent in hexadecimal, and the series h<sub>i</sub>h<sub>i\u22121</sub>...h<sub>2</sub>h<sub>1</sub> be the hexadecimal digits representing the number.\n\n# i \u2190 1\n# h<sub>i</sub> \u2190 d mod 16\n# d \u2190 (d \u2212 h<sub>i</sub>) / 16\n# If d = 0 (return series h<sub>i</sub>) else increment i and go to step 2\n\n\"16\" may be replaced with any other base that may be desired.\n\nThe following is a [[JavaScript]] implementation of the above algorithm for converting any number to a hexadecimal in String representation. Its purpose is to illustrate the above algorithm. To work with data seriously, however, it is much more advisable to work with [[bitwise operators]].\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\nfunction toHex(d) {\n  var r = d % 16;\n  if (d - r == 0) {\n    return toChar(r);\n  }\n  return toHex( (d - r)/16 ) + toChar(r);\n}\n\nfunction toChar(n) {\n  const alpha = \"0123456789ABCDEF\";\n  return alpha.charAt(n);\n}\n</source>\n\n===Addition and multiplication===\n[[Image:Hexadecimal multiplication table.svg|right|thumb|A hexadecimal [[multiplication table]]]]\nIt is also possible to make the conversion by assigning each place in the source base the hexadecimal representation of its place value and then performing multiplication and addition to get the final representation.\nThat is, to convert the number B3AD to decimal one can split the hexadecimal number into its digits: B (11<sub>10</sub>), 3 (3<sub>10</sub>), A (10<sub>10</sub>) and D (13<sub>10</sub>), and then get the final result by multiplying each decimal representation by 16<sup>''p''</sup>, where ''p'' is the corresponding hex digit position, counting from right to left, beginning with 0. In this case we have {{math|B3AD {{=}} (11\u2009\u00d7\u200916<sup>3</sup>) + (3\u2009\u00d7\u200916<sup>2</sup>) + (10\u2009\u00d7\u200916<sup>1</sup>) + (13\u2009\u00d7\u200916<sup>0</sup>)}}, which is 45997 base 10.\n\n===Tools for conversion===\nMost modern computer systems with [[graphical user interface]]s provide a built-in calculator utility, capable of performing conversions between various radices, in general including hexadecimal.\n\nIn [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[Calculator (Windows)|Calculator]] utility can be set to Scientific mode (called Programmer mode in some versions), which allows conversions between radix 16 (hexadecimal), 10 (decimal), 8 ([[octal]]) and 2 ([[Binary numeral system|binary]]), the bases most commonly used by programmers. In Scientific Mode, the on-screen [[numeric keypad]] includes the hexadecimal digits A through F, which are active when \"Hex\" is selected. In hex mode, however, the Windows Calculator supports only integers.\n\n==Real numbers==\n\n===Rational numbers===\nAs with other numeral systems, the hexadecimal system can be used to represent [[rational number]]s, although [[repeating decimal|repeating expansions]] are common since sixteen (10<sub>hex</sub>) has only a single prime factor (two):\n\n{| style=\"text-align:right;\" border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3\n|-\n| '''1/2'''  ||style=\"text-align:center\"| '''=''' || '''0.8'''\n|-\n| 1/3        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|5}}\n|-\n| '''1/4'''  ||style=\"text-align:center\"| '''=''' || '''0.4'''\n|-\n| 1/5        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|3}}\n|-\n| 1/6        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.2{{overline|A}}\n|-\n| 1/7        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|249}}\n|-\n| '''1/8'''  ||style=\"text-align:center\"| '''=''' || '''0.2'''\n|-\n| 1/9        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|1C7}}\n|-\n| 1/A        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.1{{overline|9}}\n|-\n| 1/B        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|1745D}}\n|-\n| 1/C        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.1{{overline|5}}\n|-\n| 1/D        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|13B}}\n|-\n| 1/E        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.1{{overline|249}}\n|-\n| 1/F        ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|1}}\n|-\n| '''1/10''' ||style=\"text-align:center\"| '''=''' || '''0.1'''\n|-\n| 1/11       ||style=\"text-align:center\"| =       || 0.{{overline|0F}}\n|}\n\nwhere an [[overline#In mathematics|overline]] denotes a recurring pattern.\n\nFor any base, 0.1 (or \"1/10\") is always equivalent to one divided by the representation of that base value in its own number system. Thus, whether dividing one by two for [[binary numeral system|binary]] or dividing one by sixteen for hexadecimal, both of these fractions are written as <code>0.1</code>. Because the radix 16 is a [[square number|perfect square]] (4<sup>2</sup>), fractions expressed in hexadecimal have an odd period much more often than decimal ones, and there are no [[cyclic number]]s (other than trivial single digits). Recurring digits are exhibited when the denominator in lowest terms has a [[prime factor]] not found in the radix; thus, when using hexadecimal notation, all fractions with denominators that are not a [[power of two]] result in an infinite string of recurring digits (such as thirds and fifths). This makes hexadecimal (and binary) less convenient than [[decimal]] for representing rational numbers since a larger proportion lie outside its range of finite representation.\n\nAll rational numbers finitely representable in hexadecimal are also finitely representable in decimal, [[duodecimal]] and [[sexagesimal]]: that is, any hexadecimal number with a finite number of digits has a finite number of digits when expressed in those other bases. Conversely, only a fraction of those finitely representable in the latter bases are finitely representable in hexadecimal. For example, decimal 0.1 corresponds to the infinite recurring representation 0.199999999999... in hexadecimal. However, hexadecimal is more efficient than bases 12 and 60 for representing fractions with powers of two in the denominator (e.g., decimal one sixteenth is 0.1 in hexadecimal, 0.09 in duodecimal, 0;3,45 in sexagesimal and 0.0625 in decimal).\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=2 style=\"vertical-align:bottom;\" | n\n! colspan=3 | Decimal<br />Prime factors of base, b = 10: {{color|Green|2}}, {{color|Green|5}}; b \u2212 1 = 9: {{color|Blue|3}}; b + 1 = 11: {{color|Orange|11}}\n! colspan=3 | Hexadecimal<br/>Prime factors of base, b = 16{{sub|10}} = 10: {{color|Green|2}}; b \u2212 1 = 15{{sub|10}} = F: {{color|Blue|3, 5}}; b + 1 = 17{{sub|10}} = 11: {{color|Orange|11}}\n|-\n!

Webster's Third New International online derives ''hexadecimal'' as an alteration of the all-Latin ''sexadecimal'' (which appears in the earlier Bendix documentation). The earliest date attested for ''hexadecimal'' in Merriam-Webster Collegiate online is 1954, placing it safely in the category of [[international scientific vocabulary]] (ISV). It is common in ISV to mix Greek and Latin [[combining form]]s freely. The word ''[[sexagesimal]]'' (for base 60) retains the Latin prefix. [[Donald Knuth]] has pointed out that the etymologically correct term is ''senidenary'' (or possibly, ''sedenary''), from the Latin term for ''grouped by 16''. (The terms ''binary'', ''ternary'' and ''quaternary'' are from the same Latin construction, and the etymologically correct terms for ''decimal'' and ''octal'' arithmetic are ''denary'' and ''octonary'', respectively.)<ref>Knuth, Donald.

Although any 16 symbols from the ASCII character set can be used, in practice the ASCII digits '0'-'9' and the letters 'A'-'F' (or the lowercase 'a'-'f') are always chosen in order to align with standard written notation for hexadecimal numbers.\n\nThere are several advantages of Base16 encoding:\n* Most programming languages already have facilities to parse ASCII-encoded hexadecimal\n* Being exactly half a byte, 4-bits is easier to process than the 5 or 6 bits of Base32 and Base64 respectively\n* The symbols 0-9 and A-F are universal in hexadecimal notation, so it is easily understood at a glance without needing to rely on a symbol lookup table\n* Many CPU architectures have dedicated instructions that allow access to a half-byte (otherwise known as a \"[[Nibble]]\"), making it more efficient in hardware than Base32 and Base64\n\nThe main disadvantages of Base16 encoding are:\n* Space efficiency is only 50%, since each 4-bit value from the original data will be encoded as an 8-bit byte. In contrast, Base32 and Base64 encodings have a space efficiency of 63% and 75% respectively.\n* Possible added complexity of having to accept both uppercase and lowercase letters\n\nSupport for Base16 encoding is ubiquitous in modern computing. It is the basis for the [[World Wide Web Consortium|W3C]] standard for [[Percent-encoding|URL Percent Encoding]], where a character is replaced with a percent sign \"%\" and its Base16-encoded form. Most modern programming languages directly include support for formatting and parsing Base16-encoded numbers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Base32]], [[Base64]] (content encoding schemes)\n*[[Hexadecimal time]]\n*[[IBM hexadecimal floating point]]\n* [[Hex editor]]\n* [[Hex dump]]\n* [[Bailey\u2013Borwein\u2013Plouffe formula]] (BBP)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Savard_2018_CA\">{{cite web |title=Computer Arithmetic |at=The Early Days of Hexadecimal |author-first=John J.

To construct a histogram, the first step is to \"[[Data binning|bin]]\" (or \"[[Data binning|bucket]]\") the range of values\u2014that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervals\u2014and then count how many values fall into each interval.  The bins are usually specified as consecutive, non-overlapping [[interval (mathematics)|interval]]s of a variable. The bins (intervals) must be adjacent, and are often (but are not required to be) of equal size.<ref>{{cite book |last=Howitt |first=D. |last2=Cramer |first2=D. |year=2008 |title=Introduction to Statistics in Psychology |location= |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=Fourth |isbn=978-0-13-205161-3 }}</ref>\n\nIf the bins are of equal size, a rectangle is erected over the bin with height proportional to the [[Frequency (statistics)|frequency]]\u2014the number of cases in each bin.

It then shows the proportion of cases that fall into each of several [[Categorization|categories]], with the sum of the heights equaling 1.\n\nHowever, bins need not be of equal width; in that case, the erected rectangle is defined to have its ''area'' proportional to the frequency of cases in the bin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Freedman |first=D. |last2=Pisani |first2=R. |last3=Purves |first3=R. |year=1998 |title=Statistics |edition=Third |location= |publisher=W.

The total area of a histogram used for probability density is always normalized to 1. If the length of the intervals on the ''x''-axis are all 1, then a histogram is identical to a [[relative frequency]] plot.\n\nA histogram can be thought of as a simplistic [[kernel density estimation]], which uses a [[kernel (statistics)|kernel]] to smooth frequencies over the bins. This yields a [[smooth function|smoother]] probability density function, which will in general more accurately reflect distribution of the underlying variable. The density estimate could be plotted as an alternative to the histogram, and is usually drawn as a curve rather than a set of boxes. Histograms are nevertheless preferred in applications, when their statistical properties need to be modeled. The correlated variation of a kernel density estimate is very difficult to describe mathematically, while it is simple for a histogram where each bin varies independently.\n\nAn alternative to kernel density estimation is the average shifted histogram,<ref>{{cite journal\n| author  = David W.

A histogram is used for [[continuous data]], where the bins represent ranges of data, while a [[bar chart]] is a plot of categorical variables.

The intervals are placed together in order to show that the data represented by the histogram, while exclusive, is also contiguous. (E.g., in a histogram it is possible to have two connecting intervals of 10.5\u201320.5 and 20.5\u201333.5, but not two connecting intervals of 10.5\u201320.5 and 22.5\u201332.5.  Empty intervals are represented as empty and not skipped.)<ref>Dean, S., & Illowsky, B. (2009, February 19). Descriptive Statistics: Histogram.

The data shown is a random sample of 10,000 points from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.]]\nIn a more general mathematical sense, a histogram is a function ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> that counts the number of observations that fall into each of the disjoint categories (known as ''bins''), whereas the graph of a histogram is merely one way to represent a histogram. Thus, if we let ''n'' be the total number of observations and ''k'' be the total number of bins, the histogram ''m''<sub>''i''</sub> meets the following conditions:\n\n: <math>n = \\sum_{i=1}^k{m_i}.</math>\n\n===Cumulative histogram===\nA cumulative histogram is a mapping that counts the cumulative number of observations in all of the bins up to the specified bin. That is, the cumulative histogram ''M''<sub>''i''</sub> of a histogram ''m''<sub>''j''</sub> is defined as:\n\n: <math>M_i = \\sum_{j=1}^i{m_j}.</math>\n\n===Number of bins and width===\nThere is no \"best\" number of bins, and different bin sizes can reveal different features of the data.  Grouping data is at least as old as [[John Graunt|Graunt]]'s work in the 17th century, but no systematic guidelines were given<ref name=scott92/> until [[Herbert Sturges|Sturges]]'s work in 1926.<ref name=sturges/>\n\nUsing wider bins where the density of the underlying data points is low reduces noise due to sampling randomness; using narrower bins where the density is high (so the signal drowns the noise) gives greater precision to the density estimation.  Thus varying the bin-width within a histogram can be beneficial.  Nonetheless, equal-width bins are widely used.\n\nSome theoreticians have attempted to determine an optimal number of bins, but these methods generally make strong assumptions about the shape of the distribution.  Depending on the actual data distribution and the goals of the analysis, different bin widths may be appropriate, so experimentation is usually needed to determine an appropriate width. There are, however, various useful guidelines and rules of thumb.<ref>''e.g.'' \u00a7 5.6 \"Density Estimation\", W. N. Venables and B. D.

Then the histogram remains equally \"rugged\" as <math>n</math> tends to infinity. If <math>s</math> is the \"width\" of the distribution (e. g., the standard deviation or the inter-quartile range), then the number of units in a bin (the frequency) is of order <math>n h/s</math> and the ''relative'' standard error is of order <math>\\sqrt{s/(n h)}</math>. Comparing to the next bin, the relative change of the frequency is of order <math>h/s</math> provided that the derivative of the density is non-zero. These two are of the same order if <math>h</math> is of order <math>s/n^{1/3}</math>, so that <math>k</math> is of order <math>n^{1/3} </math>.

The last is the largest island in the group; it is often called the \"Big Island\" or \"Hawai{{okina}}i Island\" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.\n\nHawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists. Because of its central location in the Pacific and 19th-century labor migration, Hawaii's culture is strongly influenced by North American and [[East Asian]] cultures, in addition to its [[Native Hawaiians|indigenous Hawaiian]] culture. Hawaii has over a million permanent residents, along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. Its capital is [[Honolulu]] on the island of O{{okina}}ahu.\n\nHawaii is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|8th-smallest]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|11th-least populous]], but the [[List of U.S. states by population density|13th-most densely populated]] of the 50 U.S. states.

With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established. The [[University of Hawaii System|University of Hawaii]] developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} [[Hawai'i Sign Language]], a [[sign language]] for the deaf based on the Hawaiian language, has been in use in the islands since the early 1800s. It is dwindling in numbers due to [[American Sign Language]] supplanting HSL through schooling and various other domains.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nHawaiian distinguishes between [[vowel length|long and short vowel sounds]]. In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a [[macron (diacritic)|macron]] (''[[Hawaiian language#Orthography (writing system)|kahak\u014d]]'').  Hawaiian-language newspapers (''n\u016bpepa'') published from 1834 to 1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing. The {{okina}}okina and kahak\u014d are intended to help non-native speakers.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  The Hawaiian language uses the [[glottal stop]] (''[[\u02bbOkina|{{okina}}okina]]'') as a consonant. It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or left-hanging (opening) single quotation mark.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n====Hawaiian Pidgin====\n{{Main|Hawaiian Pidgin}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nSome residents of Hawaii speak [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawai{{okina}}i Creole English]] (HCE), endonymically called ''pidgin'' or ''pidgin English''. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also uses words that have derived from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Ilocano and Tagalog. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration\u2014mainly from China, Japan, Portugal\u2014especially from the [[Azores]] and [[Madeira]], and Spain\u2014catalyzed the development of a hybrid variant of English known to its speakers as ''pidgin''. By the early 20th century, pidgin speakers had children who acquired it as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic.{{clarify|date=March 2015}} Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ''ahi''.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nHCE speakers have modified the meanings of some English words. For example, \"aunty\" and \"uncle\" may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder. [[Syntax]] and [[grammar]] follow distinctive rules different from those of General American English. For example, instead of \"it is hot today, isn't it?\", an HCE speaker would say simply \"stay hot, eh?\"{{efn|English \"to be\" is often omitted in Pidgin. In contexts where \"to be\" is used in [[General American]], \"to stay\" is preferred. \"To stay\" may have arisen due to an English calque of the Portuguese ''[[:en:wikt:ser#Portuguese|ser]]'', ''[[:en:wikt:estar#Portuguese|estar]]'', or ''[[:en:wikt:ficar#Portuguese|ficar]]''. ''Eh?'' ({{IPA-all|\u00e6\u0303\u02d0\u02e7\u02e6}}) is a [[tag question]] which may have roots in Japanese, which utilizes \u306d (ne?) to emphasize a point that may be agreed upon by all parties, or may come from Portuguese [[:en:wikt:n\u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e9?]] (shortened from \"[[:en:wikt:n\u00e3o \u00e9#Portuguese|n\u00e3o \u00e9?]]\"), cf. French [[:en:wikt:n'est-ce pas#French|n'est-ce pas ?]]. ''Eh?'' may also have come from English ''yeah''.}} The term ''[[da kine]]'' is used as a [[filler (linguistics)|filler]]; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their ways elsewhere through surfing communities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Perspective view of northwest elevation - Makiki Christian Church, 829 Pensacola Street, Honolulu, Honolulu County, HI HABS HI-533-1.tif|thumb|alt=The fa\u00e7ade of a Christian church in downtown Honolulu.|The Makiki Christian Church in Honolulu heavily draws upon [[Japanese architecture]].]]\n\nChristianity is the most widespread religion in Hawaii.

Like other regions with desirable weather throughout the year, such as areas of [[California]], [[Arizona]] and [[Florida]], Hawaii's residents can be considered to be subject to a \"[[Sunshine tax]]\". This situation is further exacerbated by the natural factors of geography and world distribution that lead to higher prices for goods due to increased shipping costs, a problem which many [[island country|island states and territories]] suffer from as well.\n\nThe higher costs to ship goods across an ocean may be further increased by the requirements of the [[Merchant Marine Act of 1920|Jones Act]], which generally requires that goods be transported between places within the U.S., including between the mainland U.S. west coast and Hawaii, using only U.S.-owned, built, and crewed ships. Jones Act-compliant vessels are often more expensive to build and operate than foreign equivalents, which can drive up shipping costs. While the Jones Act does not affect transportation of goods to Hawaii directly from Asia, this type of trade is nonetheless not common; this is a result of other primarily economic reasons including additional costs associated with stopping over in Hawaii (e.g. pilot and port fees), the market size of Hawaii, and the economics of using ever-larger ships that cannot be handled in Hawaii for transoceanic voyages. Therefore, Hawaii relies on receiving most inbound goods on Jones Act-qualified vessels originating from the U.S. west coast, which may contribute to the increased cost of some consumer goods and therefore the overall cost of living.<ref name=\"Keeping up with the Jones Act\">{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |title=Keeping up with the Jones Act |date=August 2012 |website=[[Hawaii Business Magazine]] |publisher=PacificBasin Communications |location=Honolulu, HI |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823083544/http://www.hawaiibusiness.com/Hawaii-Business/August-2012/The-pros-and-cons-of-the-Jones-Act/ |archivedate=August 23, 2012 |deadurl=no|accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"U.S. Law Restricting Foreign Ships Leads to Higher Gas Prices\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/10736/Jones-Act-Does-Not-Bar-International-Trade-From-Hawaii.aspx|title=Jones Act Does Not Bar International Trade From Hawaii|last=Hansen|first=Michael|date=October 3, 2013|website=|publisher=Hawai'i Free Press|location=Honolulu, Hawai\u2018i|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHawaiian consumers ultimately bear the expense of transporting goods imposed by the Jones Act.

Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast [[Polynesian Triangle]] of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of ''[[luau|l\u016b{{okina}}au]]'' and ''[[hula]]'', are strong enough to affect the wider United States.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{main|Cuisine of Hawaii}}\n[[File:Man with a Yoke Carrying Taro by Joseph Strong, oil on canvas board, 1880, Honolulu Museum of Art, accession 12692.1.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A painting of a man carrying taro by a yoke.|[[Taro]], or in Hawaiian ''kalo'', was one of the primary staples in Ancient Hawaii and remains a central ingredient in Hawaiian gastronomy today.]]\n\nThe [[cuisine of Hawaii]] is a fusion of many foods brought by immigrants to the Hawaiian Islands, including the earliest Polynesians and [[Native Hawaiian cuisine]], and [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Philippine cuisine|Filipino]], [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], [[Korean cuisine|Korean]], [[Polynesian cuisine|Polynesian]], [[Puerto Rican cuisine|Puerto Rican]], and [[Portuguese cuisine|Portuguese]] origins. Plant and animal food sources are imported from around the world for agricultural use in Hawaii. ''[[Poi (food)|Poi]]'', a starch made by pounding [[taro]], is one of the traditional foods of the islands. Many local restaurants serve the ubiquitous [[plate lunch]], which features two scoops of rice, a simplified version of American [[macaroni salad]] and a variety of toppings including [[hamburger]] patties, a fried egg, and [[gravy]] of a ''[[loco moco]]'', Japanese style ''[[tonkatsu]]'' or the traditional l\u016b{{okina}}au favorites, including ''[[kalua|k\u0101lua]]'' pork and ''[[laulau]]''. ''[[Spam musubi]]'' is an example of the fusion of ethnic cuisine that developed on the islands among the mix of immigrant groups and military personnel. In the 1990s, a group of chefs developed [[Hawaii regional cuisine]] as a contemporary fusion cuisine.\n\n===Customs and etiquette===\n{{Main|Customs and etiquette in Hawaii}}\nSome key customs and etiquette in Hawaii are as follows: when visiting a home, it is considered good manners to bring a small gift for one's host (for example, a dessert). Thus, parties are usually in the form of potlucks. Most locals take their shoes off before entering a home. It is customary for Hawaiian families, regardless of ethnicity, to hold a luau to celebrate a child's first birthday. It is also customary at Hawaiian weddings, especially at Filipino weddings, for the bride and groom to do a money dance (also called the [[pandanggo]]). Print media and local residents recommend that one refer to non-Hawaiians as \"locals of Hawaii\" or \"people of Hawaii\".\n\n===Hawaiian mythology===\n[[File:Ethnologisches Museum Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 009.jpg|thumb|upright|A stone carving of a Hawaiian deity, housed at a German museum.]]\n{{Main|Hawaiian mythology}}\n\nHawaiian mythology comprises the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. It is considered a variant of a more general [[Polynesian mythology]] that developed a unique character for several centuries before ''circa'' 1800. It is associated with the [[Hawaiian religion]], which was officially suppressed in the 19th century but was kept alive by some practitioners to the modern day.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Prominent figures and terms include [[Aumakua]], the spirit of an ancestor or family god and [[K\u0101ne]], the highest of the four major Hawaiian deities.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===Polynesian mythology===\n{{main|Polynesian mythology}}\n\n[[File:Tahiti-Oro.jpg|thumb|upright|A sacred god figure wrapping for the war god [['Oro]], made of woven dried coconut fibre ([[sennit]]), which would have protected a Polynesian god effigy (''to'o''), made of wood.]]\n\nPolynesian mythology is the [[oral tradition]]s of the people of Polynesia, a grouping of Central and South Pacific Ocean island [[archipelago]]s in the [[Polynesian triangle]] together with the scattered cultures known as the [[Polynesian outliers]]. Polynesians speak languages that descend from a language reconstructed as [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] that was probably spoken in the area around Tonga and Samoa in around 1000 BCE.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nPrior to the 15th century, [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian people]] migrated east to the [[Cook Islands]], and from there to other island groups such as Tahiti and the [[Marquesas]]. Their descendants later discovered the islands Tahiti, Rapa Nui and later the Hawaiian Islands and New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe Polynesian languages are part of the Austronesian language family. Many are close enough in terms of vocabulary and grammar to be [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]]. There are also substantial cultural similarities between the various groups, especially in terms of social organization, childrearing, horticulture, building and textile technologies. Their mythologies in particular demonstrate local reworkings of commonly shared tales. The Polynesian cultures each have distinct but related oral traditions; legends or myths are traditionally considered to recount ancient history (the time of \"p\u014d\") and the adventures of gods (\"[[atua]]\") and deified ancestors.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n===List of state parks===\n{{main|List of Hawaiian state parks}}\n\nThere are [[list of Hawaiian state parks|many Hawaiian state parks]].\n* The [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawai{{okina}}i]] has state parks, recreation areas, and historical parks.\n* [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]] has the [[Ahukini State Recreation Pier]], six state parks, and the [[Russian Fort Elizabeth State Historical Park]].\n* [[Maui]] has two state monuments, several state parks, and the [[Polipoli Spring State Recreation Area]].

They range from deliberately anonymous vehicles to very formal heavily decorated vehicles.\n\nIn the funeral trade of some countries hearses are called '''funeral coaches'''.\n\n==History==\nThe name is derived, through the French herse, from the Latin herpex, which means a [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]]. The funeral hearse was originally a wooden or metal framework, which stood over the [[bier]] or [[coffin]] and supported the [[Pall (funeral)|pall]]. It was provided with numerous spikes to hold burning candles, and, owing to the resemblance of these spikes to the teeth of a harrow, was called a hearse. Later on, the word was applied, not only to the construction above the coffin, but to any receptacle in which the coffin was placed. Thus<ref name=CE>{{Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Tenebrae Hearse|inline=1}}</ref> from about 1650<ref name=OED>Oxford English Dictionary Online accessed 26 January 2018</ref> it came to denote the vehicle on which the dead are carried to the grave.<ref name=CE/>\n\nHearses were originally hand-drawn then horse-drawn after the decoration and weight of the hearse increased.

One style has opaque rear panels so the coffin is barely glimpsed.

The rear of the Cadillac commercial chassis was considerably lower than the passenger car frame, thereby lowering the rear deck height as well for ease of loading and unloading. The Cadillac hearses were shipped as incomplete cars to [[coachbuilder]]s for final assembly.\n\nThe fleet division of [[Ford Motor Company]] sells a [[Lincoln Town Car]] with a special \"hearse package\" strictly to coachbuilders. Shipped without rear seat, rear interior trim, rear window or decklid, the hearse package also features upgraded suspension, brakes, charging system and tires.\n\nThe limousine style of hearse is more popular in the United States. It is common practice in the US for the windows to be curtained, while in other countries the windows are normally left unobscured.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nUntil the 1970s, it was common for hearses to also be used as [[ambulance]]s, due to the large cargo capacity in the rear of the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hearses served as ambulances at one time|url=http://www.bgdailynews.com/special_sections/bicentennial/hearses-served-as-ambulances-at-one-time/article_aa3b7068-fde2-11e1-9f10-0019bb2963f4.html|website=www.bgdailynews.com|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ambulance and EMS History|url=https://www.alamance-nc.com/ems/about-us/history/|website=www.alamance-nc.com|accessdate=12 May 2018}}</ref> These vehicles were called \"[[combination car]]s\" and were especially used in rural areas.

The ornate Buddhist-style rear area, generally constructed of wood and in which the casket or [[urn]] is placed, is built on top of this empty cavity and most often is wider than the base of the vehicle, so that it sticks out on the sides, over the rear body panels. Popular bases for these hearses are large sedans, minivans and pickup trucks.\n\nThe ornaments on a Japanese-style hearse vary by region.

This means that, in contrast to American hearses, the rear quarter panels require less, and sometimes no, alteration. These are generally built from [[station wagons]] such as the [[Nissan Stagea]], or from executive sedans such as the [[Toyota Celsior]] ([[Lexus LS]] in the US) and [[Nissan Cima]] ([[Infiniti Q45]] in the US).

The Cadillac hearse is now privately owned in central California and is preserved, looking essentially identical to the way it did in the film. Only one Jaguar \"hearse\" was built and was destroyed as part of the film's storyline. Several ''Harold and Maude'' fans have since built similar hearses from E-Types and photos of them can be found online.

After a destructive period of [[interregnum]] (1301\u20131308), the first [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] king, [[Charles I of Hungary]] \u2013 a bilineal descendant of the \u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty \u2013 successfully restored royal power, and defeated oligarch rivals, the so-called \"little kings\". The second Angevin Hungarian king, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342\u20131382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples), and was also [[King of Poland]] from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilized only when [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387\u20131437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene.

After the tanks rolled in, the Hungarian Service did then broadcast warnings. But by then it was too late  \"Many Hungarian Jews who survived the deportations claimed that they had not been informed by their leaders, that no one had told them. But there's plenty of evidence that they could have known,\" said David Cesarani, professor of history at Royal Holloway, University of London.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007259 |title=Auschwitz: Chronology |publisher=Ushmm.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-13}}</ref> During the German occupation in May\u2013June 1944, the Arrow Cross and Hungarian police deported nearly 440,000 Jews, mainly to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]].

The Soviet leadership selected [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] to front the [[Stalinization]] of the country, and R\u00e1kosi ''de facto'' ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime. In the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/First-Domino,4091.aspx |title=Granville/ frm |format=PDF |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[Gulag]]s.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref>  Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm \"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>\n\n==== K\u00e1d\u00e1r era 1956\u20131988 ====\n{{See also|Goulash Communism}}\n[[File:J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956\u20131988)]]\n\nAfter a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]]. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union itself.<ref name=\"madison185\">*{{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus |title=The world economy|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2006|isbn=92-64-02261-9|page=185}}</ref> As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalized economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism.

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|in May 1990]], which saw the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1994|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1998|1998]] and [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2002|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[Hungarian European Union membership referendum, 2003|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it leaked that socialist PM [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]]'s [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|had claimed in a private speech]] that his party \"lied\" to win the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2006|recent elections]]. The popularity of left-wing parties plummeted in the ensuing political upheaval, and in 2010, [[Viktor Orb\u00e1n]]'s [[national conservatism|national-conservative]] [[Fidesz]] was [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|elected]] to a parliamentary [[supermajority]]. The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes. Although these developments were met with and still engender controversy, Fidesz secured a second parliamentary supermajority [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|in 2014]] and a third [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018|in 2018]].\n\nIn September 2018, the European parliament voted to act against Hungary, under the terms of [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union]]. Proponents of the vote claimed that the Hungarian government posed a \u201csystematic threat\u201d to democracy and the rule of law. The vote was carried with the support of 448 MEPs, narrowly clearing the two-thirds majority required. The vote marked the first the European parliament had triggered an article 7 procedure against an EU member state. [[P\u00e9ter Szijj\u00e1rt\u00f3]], the [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Hungary)|Hungarian foreign minister]], described the vote as \u201cpetty revenge\u201d which had been provoked by Hungary's tough anti-migration policies.

The Danube flows north-south right through the center of contemporary Hungary, and the entire country lies within its [[drainage basin]].\n\n[[Transdanubia]], which stretches westward from the center of the country toward Austria, is a primarily hilly region with a terrain varied by low mountains. These include the very eastern stretch of the [[Alps]], ''[[Alpokalja]]'', in the west of the country, the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] in the central region of Transdanubia, and the [[Mecsek]] Mountains and [[Vill\u00e1ny Mountains]] in the south.

However, in comparison to other European regions where such efforts were undertaken, it was not at all successful largely because of religious freedom secured by Hungarian nobles, who often happened to be Calvinist themselves.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Iparm\u0171v\u00e9szeti M\u00fazeum (1070. sz\u00e1m\u00fa m\u0171eml\u00e9k) 22.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route.

Other renowned composers are [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi|Dohn\u00e1nyi]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Gabriel von Wayditch]], [[Rudolf Wagner-R\u00e9geny]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lajtha]], [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]], [[Imre K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]], [[S\u00e1ndor Veress]] and [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa|R\u00f3zsa]]. Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.\n\nHungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighboring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesized with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.

Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows Mediaeval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

The greatest poets of the time were [[Mih\u00e1ly Csokonai Vit\u00e9z]] and [[D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi]].\nThe greatest figure of the language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]. The [[Hungarian language]] became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time, and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions.\n\n[[Hungarian literature]] has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary (mostly through translations into German, French and English).

The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.\n\n=== Porcelain ===\n{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}\nFounded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]]. In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the [[Habsburg Dynasty]] and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatised and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herend.com/ |title=Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd |publisher=Herend.com |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nZsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain, pottery, ceramics, tiles and stoneware. The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics.\nThe Zsolnay factory was established by Mikl\u00f3s Zsolnay in [[P\u00e9cs]], Hungary, to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853. In 1863, his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828\u20131900) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{See also|Hungary at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Vaterpolo Hungary vs Italy semifinal game2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hungary men's national water polo team]] is considered among the best in the world, holding the world record for Olympic golds and overall medals]]\n[[File:Groupama Arena Budapest (17267881892).jpg|right|thumb|[[Groupama Arena]], [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC]]'s [[UEFA stadium categories|UEFA category four stadium]]]]\n[[File:Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ferenc Pusk\u00e1s]], the best goalscorer of the 20th century, [[FIFA Pusk\u00e1s Award]] named after him]]\n\n[[Hungary at the Olympics|Hungarian athletes]] have been successful contenders in the [[Olympic Games]], only ten countries have won more Olympic medals than Hungary, with a total of 498 medals ranking eighth in an [[all-time Olympic Games medal count]].

The historiography of a specific topic covers how historians have studied that topic using particular sources, techniques, and theoretical approaches. Scholars discuss historiography by topic&nbsp;\u2013 such as the \"[[historiography of the United Kingdom]]\", the \"[[historiography of Canada]]\", \"[[historiography of the British Empire]]\", the \"[[historiography of early Islam]]\", the \"[[Chinese historiography|historiography of China]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 and different approaches and genres, such as [[political history]] and [[social history]]. Beginning in the nineteenth century, with the ascent of [[academic history]], there developed a body of historiographic literature. The extent to which historians are influenced by their own groups and loyalties&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Historiography and nationalism|to their nation state]]&nbsp;\u2013 is a debated question.<ref>Marc Ferro, ''The Use and Abuse of History: Or How the Past Is Taught to Children'' (2003).</ref>\n\nThe research interests of historians change over time, and there has been a shift away from traditional diplomatic, economic, and political history toward newer approaches, especially social and [[Postcolonialism|cultural studies]]. From 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history increased from 31 to 41 percent, while the proportion of political historians decreased from 40 to 30 percent.<ref>Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%.

In that sense certain [[Official history|official historians]] were given the title \"[[Historiographer Royal]]\" in [[Rikshistoriograf|Sweden]] (from 1618), [[Historiographer Royal (England)|England]] (from 1660), and [[Historiographer Royal (Scotland)|Scotland]] (from 1681). The Scottish post is still in existence.\n\nHistoriography was more recently defined as \"the study of the way history has been and is written&nbsp;\u2013 the history of historical writing\", which means that, \"When you study 'historiography' you do not study the events of the past directly, but the changing interpretations of those events in the works of individual historians.\"<ref>(''The Methods and Skills of History: A Practical Guide'', 1988, p. 223, {{ISBN|0-88295-982-4}})</ref>\n\n==Antiquity==\n{{see|Ancient history}}\nUnderstanding the past appears to be a universal human need, and the \"telling of history\" has emerged independently in civilizations around the world. \nWhat constitutes history is a philosophical question (see [[philosophy of history]]).{{weasel-inline|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe earliest [[Chronology|chronologies]] date back to [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt]], though no historical writers in these early civilizations were known by name. \nBy contrast, the term \"historiography\" is taken to refer to written history recorded in a narrative format for the purpose of informing future generations about events. In this limited sense, \"ancient history\" begins with the early historiography of [[Classical Antiquity]], in about the 5th century BCE.\n\n===East Asia===\n====China====\n{{Main article|Chinese historiography|Twenty-Four Histories}}\n{{further information|Chinese literature}}\n[[File:Shiji.jpg|upright|thumb|First page of the ''[[Shiji]]''.]]\n\nOne of the Confucian [[Five Classics]], the ''Shang Shu'' \u5c1a\u66f8, has conventionally been given the English title ''[[Classic of History]]''. This terminology is misleading as the book is a collection of speeches and anecdotes about ancient worthies, which while arranged in rough chronological order lacks any attempt to integrate them into a coherent narrative or indicate exactly how much time has passed between two incidents. The purpose of the book is less about recording history and more about imparting moral lessons.\n  \nThe first true history of China is therefore the ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|BCE}}. It is among the earliest surviving historical texts to be arranged on [[Annals|annalistic]] principles in the world, and was traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551\u2013479 BCE). A \"commentary\" on the Spring and Autumn, the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum|5th century|BCE}}, is considered the earliest work of narrative history in the world, covering the period from {{annum|722 to 468|BCE}}. It is many times longer and much more detailed and vivid than the laconic text it is purportedly commenting on, so that it is commonly regarded as a work of history in its own right.<ref>{{cite book|author=D.R.

The purpose of the work is rather to teach the reader useful diplomatic and strategic skills rather than provide a coherent narrative of the period.\n\nThe Han dynasty eunuch [[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum|100|BCE}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Shiji]]'' (''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''), a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum|16th century|BCE}}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work pioneered the \"Annals-biography\" format, which would become the standard for prestige history writing in China. In this genre a history opens with a chronological outline of court affairs, and then continues with detailed biographies of prominent people who lived during the period in question.<ref>Thomas R.

This established the notion of using dynastic boundaries as start- and end-points, and most later Chinese histories would focus on a single dynasty or group of dynasties.\n\nThe Records of the Grand Historian and Book of Han were eventually joined by the [[Book of the Later Han]] (488 CE) (replacing the earlier, and now only partially extant, Han Records from the Eastern Pavilion) and the [[Records of the Three Kingdoms]] (297 CE) to form the \"Four Histories\". These became mandatory reading for the [[Imperial Examinations]] and have therefore exerted an influence on Chinese culture comparable to the [[Thirteen_Classics|Confucian Classics]].

Greek historians greatly contributed to the development of historical methodology. The earliest known critical historical works were ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', composed by [[Herodotus|Herodotus of Halicarnassus]] (484\u2013425 BCE) who became known as the \"father of history\".<ref>John L. Myres, ''Herodotus, Father of History'' (1953).</ref> Herodotus attempted to distinguish between more and less reliable accounts, and personally conducted research by travelling extensively, giving written accounts of various Mediterranean cultures. Although Herodotus' overall emphasis lay on the actions and characters of men, he also attributed an important role to divinity in the determination of historical events.\n\n[[File:Thucydides-bust-cutout ROM.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Bust of Thucydides, Hellenistic copy of a 4th-century BC work]]\n\nThe generation following Herodotus witnessed a spate of local histories of the individual [[city-state]]s (''[[polis|poleis]]''), written by the first of the [[Local history|local historians]] who employed the written archives of city and sanctuary. [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] characterized these historians as the forerunners of Thucydides,<ref>Dionysius, ''On Thucydides'', 5.</ref> and these local histories continued to be written into [[Late Antiquity]], as long as the city-states survived. Two early figures stand out: [[Hippias of Elis]], who produced the lists of winners in the Olympic Games that provided the basic chronological framework as long as the pagan classical tradition lasted, and [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], who compiled more than two dozen histories from civic records, all of them now lost.\n\n[[Thucydides]] largely eliminated divine causality in his account of the war between Athens and Sparta, establishing a rationalistic element which set a precedent for subsequent Western historical writings. He was also the first to distinguish between cause and immediate origins of an event, while his successor [[Xenophon]] ({{c.|lk=no|431}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|355|BCE}}) introduced autobiographical elements and character studies in his ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]''.\n\nThe proverbial [[Philippic]] attacks of the Athenian orator [[Demosthenes]] ({{annum|384\u2013322|BCE}}) on [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]] marked the height of ancient political agitation. The now lost history of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] campaigns by the [[diadoch]] [[Ptolemy&nbsp;I]] ({{annum|367\u2013283|BCE}}) may represent the first historical work composed by a ruler. [[Polybius]] ({{c.|lk=no|203}}&nbsp;\u2013 {{annum|120|BCE}}) wrote on the rise of Rome to world prominence, and attempted to harmonize the Greek and Roman points of view.\n\nThe [[Chaldea]]n priest [[Berossus]] ({{annum|{{floruit|3rd century}}|BCE}}) composed a Greek-language ''History of [[Babylonia]]'' for the [[Seleucid]] king [[Antiochus&nbsp;I]], combining [[Hellenistic]] methods of historiography and [[Mesopotamia]]n accounts to form a unique composite. Reports exist of other near-eastern histories, such as that of the Phoenician historian [[Sanchuniathon]]; but he is considered semi-legendary and writings attributed to him are fragmentary, known only through the later historians [[Philo of Byblos]] and [[Eusebius]], who asserted that he wrote before even the [[Trojan war]].\n\n====Rome====\n{{Main article|Roman historiography}}\n{{further information|Latin literature}}\n[[File:Marco Porcio Caton Major.jpg|thumb|upright|The Roman [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of historian [[Cato the Elder]]]]\n\n[[Ancient Romans|The Romans]] adopted the Greek tradition, writing at first in Greek, but eventually chronicling their history in a freshly non-Greek language.

The [[Early centers of Christianity|growth of Christianity]] and its enhanced status in the Roman Empire after [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine&nbsp;I]] (see [[State church of the Roman Empire]]) led to the development of a distinct Christian historiography, influenced by both [[Christian theology]] and the nature of the [[Christian Bible]], encompassing new areas of study and views of history.  The central role of the Bible in Christianity is reflected in the preference of Christian historians for written sources, compared to the classical historians' preference for oral sources and is also reflected in the inclusion of politically unimportant people. Christian historians also focused on development of religion and society.  This can be seen in the extensive inclusion of written sources in the ''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Ecclesiastical History]]'' written by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] around 324 and in the subjects it covers.<ref name=\"sxixkf\">[http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html ''Historiography''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018032745/http://www.cuw.edu/Academics/programs/history/historiography.html |date=2007-10-18 }}, Concordia University Wisconsin , retrieved on 2 November 2007</ref>  Christian theology considered time as linear, progressing according to divine plan.

Some writers in the period did construct a more [[narrative]] form of history. These included [[Gregory of Tours]] and more successfully [[Bede]], who wrote both [[secular]] and [[ecclesiastical]] history and who is known for writing the ''[[Ecclesiastical History of the English People]]''.<ref name = \"sxixkf\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Renaissance]], history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').\n\n[[File:Ibn khaldun writting-ms.jpg|thumb|upright|Autograph writing of [[Ibn Khaldun]], pioneer of historiography, [[cultural history]], and the [[philosophy of history]].]]\n\n===Islamic world===\n{{See also|Historiography of early Islam|Muqaddimah|Muslim historians}}\n\n[[Muslim]] historical writings first began to develop in the 7th century, with the reconstruction of the Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s life in the centuries following his death.

In order to evaluate these sources, various methodologies were developed, such as the \"[[Ilm ar-Rijal|science of biography]]\", \"[[science of hadith]]\" and \"[[Isnad]]\" (chain of transmission). These methodologies were later applied to other historical figures in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]].

Among the many Italians who contributed to this were [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c. 1370\u20131444), [[Francesco Guicciardini]] (1483\u20131540), and [[Caesar Baronius|Cesare Baronio]] (1538\u20131607).\n\n===Voltaire===\nFrench ''[[Philosophes|philosophe]]'' [[Voltaire]] (1694\u20131778) had an enormous influence on the development of historiography during the Age of Enlightenment through his demonstration of fresh new ways to look at the past. Guillaume de Syon argues:\n:Voltaire recast historiography in both factual and analytical terms. Not only did he reject traditional biographies and accounts that claim the work of supernatural forces, but he went so far as to suggest that earlier historiography was rife with falsified evidence and required new investigations at the source. Such an outlook was not unique in that the scientific spirit that 18th-century intellectuals perceived themselves as invested with. A rationalistic approach was key to rewriting history.<ref>Guillaume de Syon, \"Voltaire,\" in {{cite book|author=Kelly Boyd. ed.|title=Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing, vol 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0121vD9STIMC&pg=PA1270|date=1999|publisher=Taylor & Francis|pages=1270\u201372|isbn=9781884964336}}</ref>\n\nVoltaire's best-known histories are ''[[The Age of Louis XIV]]'' (1751), and his ''[[Essai sur les m\u0153urs et l'esprit des nations|Essay on the Customs and the Spirit of the Nations]]'' (1756). He broke from the tradition of narrating diplomatic and military events, and emphasized customs, social history and achievements in the arts and sciences. He was the first scholar to make a serious attempt to write the history of the world, eliminating theological frameworks, and emphasizing economics, culture and political history. Although he repeatedly warned against political bias on the part of the historian, he did not miss many opportunities to expose the intolerance and frauds of the church over the ages. Voltaire advised scholars that anything contradicting the normal course of nature was not to be believed. Although he found evil in the historical record, he fervently believed reason and educating the illiterate masses would lead to progress.\n\nVoltaire explains his view of historiography in his article on \"History\" in Diderot's ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'': ''\"One demands of modern historians more details, better ascertained facts, precise dates, more attention to customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population.\"'' Already in 1739 he had written: ''\"My chief object is not political or military history, it is the history of the arts, of commerce, of civilization&nbsp;\u2013 in a word,&nbsp;\u2013 of the human mind.\"''<ref>{{cite book|author=E.

In 1754 he published the ''[[The History of England (David Hume)|History of England]]'', a 6-volume work which extended \"From the Invasion of Julius Caesar to the Revolution in 1688\". Hume adopted a similar scope to Voltaire in his history; as well as the history of Kings, Parliaments, and armies, he examined the history of culture, including literature and science, as well. His short biographies of leading scientists explored the process of scientific change and he developed new ways of seeing scientists in the context of their times by looking at how they interacted with society and each other&nbsp;\u2013 he paid special attention to [[Francis Bacon]], [[Robert Boyle]], [[Isaac Newton]] and [[William Harvey]].<ref>S.

He emphasised the role of forces of the spirit in history and thought that chaotic events demanded what he called 'heroes' to take control over the competing forces erupting within society. He considered the dynamic forces of history as being the hopes and aspirations of people that took the form of ideas, and were often ossified into ideologies. Carlyle's ''The French Revolution'' was written in a highly unorthodox style, far removed from the neutral and detached tone of the tradition of Gibbon. Carlyle presented the history as dramatic events unfolding in the present as though he and the reader were participants on the streets of Paris at the famous events.  Carlyle's invented style was epic poetry combined with philosophical treatise. It is rarely read or cited in the last century.<ref>Alfred Cobban, \"Carlyle's French Revolution\", ''History'' (1963) 48#164 pp. 306\u201316.</ref><ref>Mark Cumming, ''A Disimprisoned Epic: Form and Vision in Carlyle's French Revolution'' (1988).</ref>\n\n===French historians: Michelet and Taine===\n[[File:Jules Michelet portrait older.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jules Michelet (1798\u20131874), later in his career.]]\n[[File:Hippolyte taine.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hippolyte Taine (1828\u20131893)]]\n\nIn his main work ''Histoire de France'' (1855), French historian [[Jules Michelet]] (1798\u20131874) coined the term [[Renaissance]] (meaning \"rebirth\" in [[French language|French]]), as a period in Europe's cultural history that represented a break from the Middle Ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brotton|first=Jerry|title=The Renaissance Bazaar|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=21\u201322}}</ref> The 19-volume work covered French history from [[Charlemagne]] to the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]].

According to [[John Lukacs]], he was the first master of cultural history, which seeks to describe the spirit and the forms of expression of a particular age, a particular people, or a particular place.  His innovative approach to historical research stressed the importance of art and its inestimable value as a primary source for the study of history. He was one of the first historians to rise above the narrow nineteenth-century notion that \"history is past politics and politics current history.<ref>John Lukacs, Remembered Past: John Lukacs on History, Historians, and Historical Knowledge, ed.

[[William Stubbs]]'s  ''Constitutional History of England'' (3 vols., 1874\u201378) was an important influence on this developing field. The work traced the development of the English constitution from the Teutonic invasions of Britain until 1485, and marked a distinct step in the advance of English historical learning.<ref>[[s:A Short Biographical Dictionary of English Literature/Stubbs, William]]</ref> He argued that the theory of the unity and continuity of history should not remove distinctions between ancient and modern history. He believed that, though work on ancient history is a useful preparation for the study of modern history, either may advantageously be studied apart.

[[Leopold von Ranke]] (1795\u20131886) at Berlin was a pivotal influence in this regard, and was the founder of modern source-based history.<ref>Frederick C.

Beginning with his first book in 1824, the ''History of the Latin and Teutonic Peoples from 1494 to 1514'', Ranke used an unusually wide variety of sources for a historian of the age, including \"memoirs, diaries, personal and formal missives, government documents, diplomatic dispatches and first-hand accounts of eye-witnesses\". Over a career that spanned much of the century, Ranke set the standards for much of later historical writing, introducing such ideas as reliance on [[primary source]]s, an emphasis on [[narrative history]] and especially international politics (''aussenpolitik'').<ref>E. Sreedharan, ''A textbook of historiography, 500&nbsp;BC to AD&nbsp;2000'' (2004) p. 185</ref>  Sources had to be solid, not speculations and rationalizations. His credo was to write history the way it was. He insisted on primary sources with proven authenticity.\n\nRanke also rejected the 'teleological approach' to history, which traditionally viewed each period as inferior to the period which follows. In Ranke's view, the historian had to understand a period on its own terms, and seek to find only the general ideas which animated every period of history. In 1831 and at the behest of the [[Prussia]]n government, Ranke founded and edited the first historical journal in the world, called ''Historisch-Politische Zeitschrift''.\n\nAnother important German thinker was [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], whose theory of historical progress ran counter to Ranke's approach. In Hegel's own words, his philosophical theory of \"World history... represents the development of the spirit's consciousness of its own [[Freedom of will|freedom]] and of the consequent realization of this freedom.\".<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA138&hl=en&dq=%22represents+the+development+of+the+spirit's+consciousness+of+its+own+freedom+and+of+the+consequent+realisation+of+this+freedom.%22 p. 138].</ref> This realization is seen by studying the various cultures that have developed over the millennia, and trying to understand the way that freedom has worked itself out through them:\n\n<blockquote>World history is the record of the spirit's efforts to attain knowledge of what it is in itself.

The consciousness of freedom first awoke among the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and they were accordingly free; but, like the Romans, they only knew that '''Some''', and not all men as such, are free.... The [[Germans#Middle Ages|Germanic nations]], with the rise of [[Christianity]], were the first to realize that '''All''' men are by nature free, and that freedom of spirit is his very essence.<ref>''Lectures'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjfaimuprzoC&pg=PA54&hl=en&dq=%22World+history+is+the+record+of+the+spirit's+efforts+to+attain+knowledge+of+what+it+is+in+itself.+The+Orientals+do+not+know+that+the+spirit+or+man+as+such+are+free+in+themselves.+And+because+they+do+not+know+that,+they+are+not+themselves+free.+They+only+know+that+One+is+free.%22%22The+consciousness+of+freedom+first+awoke+among+the+Greeks,+and+they+were+accordingly+free;+but,+like+the+Romans,+they+only+knew+that+Some,+and+not+all+men+as+such,+are+free%22%22The+Germanic+nations,+with+the+rise+of+Christianity,+were+the+first+to+realize+that+All+men+are+by+nature+free,+and+that+freedom+of+spirit+is+his+very+essence.%22 p. 54].</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Karl Marx]] introduced the concept of [[historical materialism]] into the study of world historical development. In his conception, the economic conditions and dominant modes of production determined the structure of society at that point. In his view five successive stages in the development of material conditions would occur in [[Western Europe]]. The first stage was [[primitive communism]] where property was shared and there was no concept of \"leadership\". This progressed to a [[Slavery|slave society]] where the idea of [[Social class|class]] emerged and the [[State (polity)|State]] developed. [[Feudalism]] was characterized by an [[aristocracy]] working in partnership with a [[theocracy]] and the emergence of the [[Nation-state]]. [[Capitalism]] appeared after the bourgeois revolution when the capitalists (or their merchant predecessors) overthrew the feudal system and established a [[market economy]], with\n[[private property]] and [[Parliamentary democracy]]. Marx then predicted the eventual proletarian revolution that would result in the attainment of [[socialism]], followed by [[Communism]], where property would be communally owned.\n\nPrevious historians had focused on cyclical events of the rise and decline of rulers and nations. Process of [[nationalization of history]], as part of [[Romantic nationalism|national revivals]] in the 19th century, resulted with separation of \"one's own\" history from common [[universal history]] by such way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that constructed history as history of a nation.<ref name = \"laboratory\">{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/?id=f52rawP96lYC&pg=PA39&lpg=PA39&dq=%22nationalisation+of+history%22#v=onepage&q=%22nationalisation%20of%20history%22&f=false\n| title       = A Laboratory of Transnational History Ukraine and recent Ukrainian historiography\n| accessdate  = October 18, 2010\n| author      = Georgiy Kasianov, Philipp Terr\n| pages       = 7\n| quote       = This essay deals with, what I call, \"nationalized history\", meaning a way of perceiving, understanding and treating the past that requires separation of \"one's own\" history from \"common\" history and its construction as history of a nation.\n| isbn       = 978-1-84545-621-4\n| date         = 2010-04-07}}</ref> A new discipline, [[sociology]], emerged in the late 19th century and analyzed and compared these perspectives on a larger scale.\n\n===Macaulay and Whig history===\n[[File:Thomas Babington Macaulay, Baron Macaulay.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Macaulay]] was the most influential exponent of the [[Whig history]]]]\n\n[[Thomas Macaulay]] produced his most famous work of history, ''[[The History of England from the Accession of James the Second]]'', in 1848.  His writings are famous for their ringing prose and for their confident, sometimes dogmatic, emphasis on a progressive model of British history, according to which the country threw off superstition, autocracy and confusion to create a balanced constitution and a forward-looking culture combined with freedom of belief and expression.

In general, Whig historians emphasized the rise of [[constitutional government]], [[personal freedom]]s and [[scientific progress]]. The term has been also applied widely in historical disciplines outside of [[British history]] (the [[history of science]], for example) to criticize any [[Teleology|teleological]] (or goal-directed), hero-based, and [[Transhistoricity|transhistorical]] narrative.<ref>Ernst Mayr, \"When Is Historiography Whiggish?\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', April 1990, Vol. 51 Issue 2, pp 301\u201309 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2709517 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n[[Paul de Rapin|Paul Rapin de Thoyras]]'s history of England, published in 1723, became \"the classic Whig history\" for the first half of the 18th century,.<ref>Hugh Trevor-Roper, 'Introduction', ''Lord Macaulay's History of England'' (Penguin Classics, 1979), p. 10.</ref> It was later supplanted by the immensely popular ''[[The History of England (Hume)|The History of England]]'' by [[David Hume]].

Intellectuals no longer believed the world was automatically getting better and better. Subsequent generations of academic historians have similarly rejected Whig history because of its [[Presentism (literary and historical analysis)|presentist]] and teleological assumption that history is driving toward some sort of goal.<ref>Victor Feske, ''From Belloc to Churchill: Private Scholars, Public Culture, and the Crisis of British Liberalism, 1900\u20131939'' (1996), p. 2.</ref> Other criticized 'Whig' assumptions included viewing the British system as the apex of human political development, assuming that political figures in the past held current political beliefs ([[anachronism]]), considering British history as a march of progress with inevitable outcomes and presenting political figures of the past as heroes, who advanced the cause of this political progress, or villains, who sought to hinder its inevitable triumph.

The school emphasized the use of quantification and the paying of special attention to geography.<ref>See Lucien Febvre, ''La Terre et l'\u00e9volution humaine'' (1922), translated as ''A Geographical Introduction to History'' (London, 1932).</ref><ref>See [http://www.editions.ehess.fr/revues/annales-histoire-sciences-sociales/numeros-parus/ for recent issues]</ref>\n\nThe ''Annales d'histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'' journal was founded in 1929 in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]. These authors, the former a medieval historian and the latter an early modernist, quickly became associated with the distinctive ''Annales'' approach, which combined geography, history, and the sociological approaches of the [[Ann\u00e9e Sociologique]] (many members of which were their colleagues at Strasbourg) to produce an approach which rejected the predominant emphasis on politics, diplomacy and war of many 19th and early 20th-century historians as spearheaded by historians whom Febvre called Les Sorbonnistes. Instead, they pioneered an approach to a study of long-term historical structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]'') over events and political transformations.<ref>Colin Jones, \"Olwen Hufton's 'Poor', Richard Cobb's 'People', and the Notions of the longue dur\u00e9e in French Revolutionary Historiography\", ''Past & Present'', 2006 Supplement (Volume 1), pp. 178\u2013203 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/past_and_present/v2006/2006.1Sjones.html in Project Muse]</ref>  Geography, material culture, and what later Annalistes called ''mentalit\u00e9s'', or the psychology of the epoch, are also characteristic areas of study. The goal of the ''Annales'' was to undo the work of the ''Sorbonnistes'', to turn French historians away from the narrowly political and diplomatic toward the new vistas in social and economic history.<ref>J.H.

Braudel developed the idea, often associated with Annalistes, of different modes of historical time: ''l'histoire quasi immobile'' (motionless history) of historical geography, the history of social, political and economic structures (''la [[longue dur\u00e9e]]''), and the history of men and events, in the context of their structures. His 'longue dur\u00e9e' approach stressed slow, and often imperceptible effects of space, climate and technology on the actions of human beings in the past.  The ''Annales'' historians, after living through two world wars and major political upheavals in France, were deeply uncomfortable with the notion that multiple ruptures and discontinuities created history. They preferred to stress slow change and the longue dur\u00e9e. They paid special attention to geography, climate, and demography as long-term factors. They considered the continuities of the deepest structures were central to history, beside which upheavals in institutions or the superstructure of social life were of little significance, for history lies beyond the reach of conscious actors, especially the will of revolutionaries.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Harris |title=Braudel: Historical Time and the Horror of Discontinuity |journal=[[History Workshop Journal]] |year=2004 |volume=57 |pages=161\u2013174 |issn=1363-3554 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/849/ }} Only Ari\u00e8s was a true conservative\u2014indeed a royalist.</ref>\n\nNoting the political upheavals in Europe and especially in France in 1968, [[Eric Hobsbawm]] argued that \"in France the virtual hegemony of Braudelian history and the ''Annales'' came to an end after 1968, and the international influence of the journal dropped steeply.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric J.

Scholars moved in multiple directions, covering in disconnected fashion the social, economic, and cultural history of different eras and different parts of the globe. By the time of crisis the school was building a vast publishing and research network reaching across France, Europe, and the rest of the world. Influence indeed spread out from Paris, but few new ideas came in. Much emphasis was given to quantitative data, seen as the key to unlocking all of social history.<ref>One of numerous spin-off journals was ''Histoire & mesure'' (1986\u2014), devoted to quantitative history.</ref>  However, the ''Annales'' ignored the developments in quantitative studies underway in the U.S. and Britain, which reshaped economic, political and demographic research.<ref>Georg G.

[[Friedrich Engels]] wrote ''[[The Peasant War in Germany]]'', which analysed social warfare in early Protestant Germany in terms of emerging capitalist classes. Although it lacked a rigorous engagement with archival sources, it indicated an early interest in [[People's history|history from below]] and class analysis, and it attempts a dialectical analysis. Another treatise of Engels, ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'', was salient in creating the [[socialist]] impetus in British politics from then on, e.g. the [[Fabian Society]].\n\n[[R. H. Tawney]] was an early historian working in this tradition. ''The Agrarian Problem in the Sixteenth Century'' (1912)<ref>[[William Rose Ben\u00e9t]] (1988) p.&nbsp;961</ref> and ''Religion and the Rise of Capitalism'' (1926), reflected his ethical concerns and preoccupations in economic history. He was profoundly interested in the issue of the enclosure of land in the English countryside in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and in [[Max Weber]]'s thesis on the connection between the appearance of [[Protestantism]] and the rise of capitalism. His belief in the rise of the gentry in the century before the outbreak of the Civil War in England provoked the 'Storm over the Gentry' in which his methods were subjected to severe criticisms by [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] and John Cooper.\n\n[[Historiography in the Soviet Union]] was greatly influenced by Marxist historiography, as [[historical materialism]] was extended into the Soviet version of [[dialectical materialism]].\n\nA circle of historians inside the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] (CPGB) formed in 1946 and became a highly influential cluster of [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Marxist historiography|Marxist historians]], who contributed to [[history from below]] and class structure in early capitalist society. While some members of the group (most notably [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] and [[E. P. Thompson]]) left the CPGB after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], the common points of British Marxist historiography continued in their works. They placed a great emphasis on the subjective determination of history.\n\nChristopher Hill's studies on 17th-century English history were widely acknowledged and recognised as representative of this school.<ref name=\"Oxford DNB\">{{cite web|title=Hill, (John Edward) Christopher (1912\u20132003)|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/89437|website=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=29 June 2012|date=January 2007}}</ref> His books include ''Puritanism and Revolution'' (1958), ''Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution'' (1965 and revised in 1996), ''The Century of Revolution'' (1961), ''AntiChrist in 17th-century England'' (1971), ''The World Turned Upside Down'' (1972) and many others.\n\n[[E. P. Thompson]] pioneered the study of history from below in his work, ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'', published in 1963. It focused on the forgotten history of the first working-class political left in the world in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. In his preface to this book, Thompson set out his approach to writing history from below:\n\n{{quote|text=I am seeking to rescue the poor stockinger, the [[Luddite]] cropper, the \"obsolete\" hand-loom weaver, the \"Utopian\" artisan, and even the deluded follower of [[Joanna Southcott]], from the enormous condescension of posterity. Their crafts and traditions may have been dying. Their hostility to the new industrialism may have been backward-looking. Their communitarian ideals may have been fantasies. Their insurrectionary conspiracies may have been foolhardy. But they lived through these times of acute social disturbance, and we did not. Their aspirations were valid in terms of their own experience; and, if they were casualties of history, they remain, condemned in their own lives, as casualties.}}\n\nThompson's work was also significant because of the way he defined \"class.\" He argued that class was not a structure, but a relationship that changed over time. He opened the gates for a generation of labor historians, such as [[David Montgomery (historian)|David Montgomery]] and [[Herbert Gutman]], who made similar studies of the American working classes.\n\nOther important Marxist historians included [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[C. L. R. James]], [[Raphael Samuel]], [[A. L. Morton]] and [[Brian Pearce]].\n\nAlthough Marxist historiography made important contributions to the history of the [[working class]], oppressed nationalities, and the [[methodology]] of [[People's history|history from below]], its chief problematic aspect was its argument on the nature of history as ''determined'' or ''dialectical''; this can also be stated as the relative importance of subjective and objective factors in creating outcomes. It increasingly fell out of favour in the 1960s and '70s. [[Geoffrey Elton]] was important in undermining the case for a [[Marxist historiography]], which he argued was presenting seriously flawed interpretations of the past. In particular, Elton was opposed to the idea that the [[English Civil War]] was caused by socioeconomic changes in the 16th and 17th centuries, arguing instead that it was due largely to the incompetence of the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings.<ref>See his essays 'The Stuart Century', 'A High Road to Civil War?' and 'The Unexplained Revolution' in G. R.

It is a field especially attractive to nonacademic historians, and often to the spouses or children of famous people, who have access to the trove of letters and documents. Academic historians tend to downplay biography because it pays too little attention to broad social, cultural, political and economic forces, and perhaps too much attention to popular psychology. The \",Great Man\" tradition in Britain originated in the multi-volume ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (which originated in 1882 and issued updates into the 1970s); it continues to this day in the new ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]].'' In the United States, the ''[[Dictionary of American Biography]]'' was planned in the late 1920s and appeared with numerous supplements into the 1980s.  It has now been displaced by the ''[[American National Biography]]'' as well as numerous smaller historical encyclopedias that give thorough coverage to Great Persons. Bookstores do a thriving business in biographies, which sell far more copies than the esoteric monographs based on post-structuralism, cultural, racial or gender history. [[Michael Holroyd]] says the last forty years \",may be seen as a golden age of biography\" but nevertheless calls it the \"shallow end of history.\"  Nicolas Barker argues that \",more and more biographies command an ever larger readership\", as he speculates that biography has come \"to express the spirit of our age.\"<ref>Lucy Riall, \"The Shallow End of History? The Substance and Future of Political Biography\", ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (2010) 40#3 pp 375\u2013397</ref>\n\nDaniel R. Meister argues that:\n:Biography Studies is emerging as an independent discipline, especially in the Netherlands. This Dutch School of biography is moving biography studies away from the less scholarly life writing tradition and towards history by encouraging its practitioners to utilize an approach adapted from microhistory.<ref> Daniel R. Meister, \"The biographical turn and the case for historical biography\" ''History Compass'' (Dec. 2017) DOI: 10.1111/hic3.12436 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hic3.12436/abstract?campaign=wolearlyview abstract] </ref>\n\n===British debates===\n{{Main article|Historiography of the United Kingdom}}\nMarxist historian [[E. H. Carr]] developed a controversial theory of history in his 1961 book ''[[What Is History?]]'', which proved to be one of the most influential books ever written on the subject.<ref name=\"Windshuttle\">{{cite web|last=Windshuttle|first=Keith|title=The Real Stuff of History|publisher=Sydney Line|year=2001|url=http://www.sydneyline.com/Real%20Stuff%20of%20History.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211162744/http://www.sydneyline.com/Real%20Stuff%20of%20History.htm|archivedate=2008-12-11|df=}}</ref> He presented a middle-of-the-road position between the empirical or  (Rankean) view of history and [[R. G. Collingwood]]'s idealism, and rejected the empirical view of the historian's work being an accretion of \"facts\" that he or she has at their disposal as nonsense.  He maintained that there is such a vast quantity of information that the historian always chooses the \"facts\" he or she decides to make use of. In Carr's famous example, he claimed that millions had crossed the Rubicon, but only Julius Caesar's crossing in 49 BC is declared noteworthy by historians.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\">Huges-Warrington, p. 26</ref><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 10;</ref> For this reason, Carr argued that [[Leopold von Ranke]]'s famous dictum ''wie es eigentlich gewesen'' (show what actually happened) was wrong because it presumed that the \"facts\" influenced what the historian wrote, rather than the historian choosing what \"facts of the past\" he or she intended to turn into \"historical facts\".<ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', pp. 8\u201313</ref> At the same time, Carr argued that the study of the facts may lead the historian to change his or her views.  In this way, Carr argued that history was \"an unending dialogue between the past and present\".<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 26\"/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 30</ref>\n\nCarr is held by some critics to have had a deterministic outlook in history.<ref name=\"Huges-Warrington, Marnie p. 27\">Huges-Warrington, p. 27. One of his first and most influential critics was the British philosopher, Michael Oakeshott, 'What is History?' (1961), in idem, ''What is History and Other Essays'' (Exeter, 2004), 325.</ref> Others have modified or rejected this use of the label \"determinist\".<ref>See M. Hewitson, ''History and Causality'' (Basingstoke, 2014), pp. 86\u201393.</ref> He took a hostile view of those historians who stress the workings of chance and contingency in the workings of history. In Carr's view, no individual is truly free of the social environment in which they live, but contended that within those limitations, there was room, albeit very narrow room for people to make decisions that affect history.  Carr emphatically contended that history was a [[Social sciences|social science]], not an [[The arts|art]],<ref name=HW28>Huges-Warrington, p. 28</ref> because historians like scientists seek generalizations that helped to broaden the understanding of one's subject.<ref name=HW28/><ref>Carr, ''What Is History?'', p. 62</ref>\n\nOne of Carr's most forthright critics was [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]], who argued that Carr's dismissal of the \"might-have-beens of history\" reflected a fundamental lack of interest in examining historical causation.<ref>Trevor-Roper, pp. 72\u201373</ref> Trevor-Roper asserted that examining possible alternative outcomes of history was far from being a \"parlour-game\" was rather an essential part of the historians' work,<ref name=\"Trevor-Roper p. 73\">Trevor-Roper, p. 73</ref> as only by considering all possible outcomes of a given situation could a historian properly understand the period.\n\nThe controversy inspired Sir [[Geoffrey Elton]] to write his 1967 book ''The Practice of History''. Elton criticized Carr for his \"whimsical\" distinction between the \"historical facts\" and the \"facts of the past\", arguing that it reflected \"...an extraordinarily arrogant attitude both to the past and to the place of the historian studying it\".<ref>Elton, Geoffrey ''The Practice of History'', London: Methuen, 1967 pp. 56\u201357</ref> Elton, instead, strongly defended the traditional methods of history and was also appalled by the inroads made by [[postmodernism]].<ref>\u00d3 Tuathaigh,M. A. G., \u2018Irish Historical \",Revisionism\": State of the Art of Ideological Project?\u2019 in, Brady, Ciaran (ed.), Interpreting Irish History (Dublin, 2006), p. 325.</ref> Elton saw the duty of historians as empirically gathering evidence and objectively analyzing what the evidence has to say. As a traditionalist, he placed great emphasis on the role of individuals in history instead of abstract, impersonal forces. Elton saw political history as the highest kind of history. Elton had no use for those who seek history to make myths, to create laws to explain the past, or to produce theories such as [[Marxism]].\n\n===U.S. approaches===\n{{main article|Historiography of the United States}}\nClassical and European history was part of the 19th-century grammar curriculum.

It stressed the central importance of class conflict in American history. Important leaders included [[Vernon L. Parrington]], [[Carl L. Becker]], [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sr.]], John Hicks, and [[C.

Instead, they proclaimed it was a:\n:social cataclysm in which the capitalists, laborers, and farmers of the North and West drove from power in the national government the planting aristocracy of the South. Viewed under the light of universal history, the fighting was a fleeting incident; the social revolution was the essential portentous outcome....

Beard, ''The Rise of American Civilization'' (1927) vol 2 pp 54, 166</ref>\n\n[[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]] wrote the ''Age of Jackson'' (1945), one of the last major books from this viewpoint. Schlesinger made Jackson a hero for his successful attacks on the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. His own views were clear enough: \"Moved typically by personal and class, rarely by public, considerations, the business community has invariably brought national affairs to a state of crisis and exasperated the rest of society into dissatisfaction bordering on revolt.\"<ref>Schlesinger, ''Age of Jackson'' (1945) p 521.</ref>\n\n====Consensus history====\n{{main article|Consensus history}}\nConsensus history emphasizes the basic unity of American values and downplays conflict as superficial.

The goal was to incorporate in historical studies perspectives from all the social sciences, especially political science, sociology and economics. The pioneers shared a commitment to quantification. However, by the 1980s the first blush of quantification had worn off, as traditional historians counterattacked. [[Harvey J. Graff]] says:\n{{quote|The case against the new mixed and confused a lengthy list of ingredients, including the following: history\u2019s supposed loss of identity and humanity in the stain of social science, the fear of subordinating quality to quantity, conceptual and technical fallacies, violation of the literary character and biographical base of \",good\" history (rhetorical and aesthetic concern), loss of audiences, derogation of history rooted in \",great men\" and \",great events\", trivialization in general, a hodge-podge of ideological objections from all directions, and a fear that new historians were reaping research funds that might otherwise come to their detractors.

It focused on the examination of history from a global perspective and looked for common patterns that emerged across all cultures. The basic thematic approach of this field was to analyse two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]]&nbsp;\u2013 (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together), and difference&nbsp;\u2013 (how patterns of world history reveal the diversity of the human experience).\n\n[[Arnold J. Toynbee]]'s ten-volume ''[[A Study of History]]'', took an approach that was widely discussed in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1960s his work was virtually ignored by scholars and the general public.  He compared 26 independent civilizations and argued that they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay.  He proposed a universal model to each of these civilizations, detailing the stages through which they all pass: genesis, growth, time of troubles, universal state, and disintegration. The later volumes gave too much emphasis on spirituality to satisfy critics.<ref>William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)</ref>\n\nChicago historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1965) to show how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. He then discusses the dramatic effect of [[Western culture|Western civilization]] on others in the past 500 years of history. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the globe. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.'' His emphasis on cultural fusions influenced historical theory significantly.<ref>William H.

The early journals were similar to those for the physical sciences, and were seen as a means for history to become more professional. Journals also helped historians to establish various historiographical approaches, the most notable example of which was ''[[Annales. \u00c9conomies, soci\u00e9t\u00e9s, civilisations]]'', a publication of the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] in France.  Journals now typically have one or more editors and associate editors, an editorial board, and a pool of scholars to whom articles that are submitted are sent for confidential evaluation.  The editors will send out new books to recognized scholars for reviews that usually run 500 to 1000 words. The vetting and publication process often takes months or longer. Publication in a prestigious journal (which accept 10% or fewer of the articles submitted) is an asset in the academic hiring and promotion process. Publication demonstrates that the author is conversant with the scholarly field.  Page charges and fees for publication are uncommon in history. Journals are subsidized by universities or historical societies, scholarly associations, and subscription fees from libraries and scholars. Increasingly they are available through library pools that allow many academic institutions to pool subscriptions to online versions. Most libraries have a system for obtaining specific articles through inter-library loan.<ref>Margaret F.

In 1979, at a time when the new [[Social History]] was demanding a social-science model of analysis, Stone detected a move back toward the narrative. Stone defined narrative as follows: it is organized [[chronological]]ly; it is focused on a single coherent story; it is descriptive rather than analytical; it is concerned with people not abstract circumstances; and it deals with the particular and specific rather than the collective and statistical. He reported that, \"More and more of the 'new historians' are now trying to discover what was going on inside people's heads in the past, and what it was like to live in the past, questions which inevitably lead back to the use of narrative.\"<ref>Lawrence Stone, \"The Revival of Narrative: Reflections on a New Old History\", ''Past and Present'' 85 (Nov 1979) pp. 3\u201324, quote on p. 13</ref>\n\nHistorians committed to a social science approach, however, have criticized the narrowness of narrative and its preference for anecdote over analysis, and its use of clever examples rather than statistically verified empirical regularities.<ref>J. Morgan Kousser, \"The Revivalism of Narrative: A Response to Recent Criticisms of Quantitative History\", ''Social Science History'' vol 8, no. 2 (Spring 1984): 133\u201349; Eric H. Monkkonen, \"The Dangers of Synthesis\", ''American Historical Review'' 91, no. 5 (December 1986): 1146\u201357.</ref>\n\n==Topics studied==\nSome of the common topics in historiography are:\n# Reliability of the sources used, in terms of authorship, credibility of the author, and the authenticity or corruption of the text.  (See also [[source criticism]]).\n# Historiographical tradition or framework. Every historian uses one (or more) historiographical traditions, for example [[Marxist]], [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], \"total history\", or [[political history]].\n# [[morality|Moral]] issues, guilt assignment, and praise assignment\n# [[historical revisionism|Revisionism]] versus [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] interpretations\n# Historical [[metanarratives]] and metahistory.<ref>Nikola\u012d Onufrievich Losski\u012d -History of Russian Philosophy 1951 \u2013 - Page 245 \"It must not be imagined, however, that history and metahistory are entirely separate: \"Metahistory is continually present as the background of history. That which is metahistorical breaks up both the cosmic endless sequence of events and the ...\"</ref><ref>The Visva-bharati Quarterly 1956\u2013 Page 118  \"8 Sometimes the term Metahistory is also used. But it implies going beyond, a transcendence of history and in this sense it is equated with metaphysics and theology. Sometimes historical time is distinguised from metahistorical eternity.\"</ref>\n\n==Approaches==\nHow a historian approaches historical events is one of the most important decisions within historiography. It is commonly recognised by historians that, in themselves, individual historical facts dealing with names, dates and places are not particularly meaningful. Such facts will only become useful when assembled with other historical evidence, and the process of assembling this evidence is understood as a particular historiographical approach.\n\nThe most influential historiographical approaches are:\n\n* [[Business history]]\n* [[Comparative history]]\n* [[Cultural history]]\n* [[Diplomatic history]]\n* [[Economic history]]\n* [[Environmental history]], a relatively new field\n* [[Ethnohistory]]\n* [[Gender history]] including [[Woman's history]], [[Family history]], [[Feminist history]]\n* [[History of medicine|History of Medicine]]\n* [[History of Religion]] and [[Church history|Church History]]; the history of theology is usually handled under [[Theology]]\n* [[Intellectual History]] and [[History of ideas]]\n* [[Labor history (discipline)|Labor history]]\n* [[Local History]] and [[Microhistory]]\n* [[Marxist historiography]] and [[Historical materialism]]\n* [[Military history]], including naval and air\n* [[Oral history]]\n* [[Political history]]\n* [[Public history]], especially museums and historic preservation\n* [[Quantitative history]], [[Cliometrics]] (in economic history); [[Prosopography]] using statistics to study biographies\n* [[History of religions]]\n* [[Historiography of science]] \n* [[Social history]] and [[People's history|History from below]]; along with the French version the [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]] and the German [[Bielefeld School]]\n* [[Subaltern Studies]], Regarding post-colonial India\n* [[Urban history]]\n** [[American urban history]]\n* [[Whig history]], History as the story of continuous progress\n* [[World history]]\n\n===Related fields===\nImportant related fields include:\n* [[Antiquarian]]ism\n* [[Genealogy]]\n* [[Numismatics]]\n* [[Intellectual history]]\n* [[Paleography]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Pseudohistory]]\n\n== See also ==\n\n* {{Portal-inline|Historiography}}\n* [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[National memory]]\n\n===Methods===\n* [[Archival research]]\n* [[Auxiliary sciences of history]]\n* [[Historical method]]\n* [[List of historians]], inclusive of most major historians\n** [[List of historians by area of study]]\n* [[List of history journals]]\n* [[Philosophy of history]]\n* [[Popular history]]\n** [[Primary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 documents, correspondence, diaries\n*** [[Secondary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 interpretations, written history\n**** [[Tertiary source]]&nbsp;\u2013 textbooks and encyclopedias\n* [[Public history]], including museums and historical preservation\n* [[Historical revisionism]]\n* [[Shared historical authority]]\n* [[v:Topic:Historiography|Historiography at Wikiversity]], where it is part of the [[v:School:History|School of History]]\n\n===Topics===\n* [[Historiography of Argentina]]\n* [[Atlantic history]]\n* [[Historiography of Canada]]\n* [[Chinese historiography]]\n* [[Classics]]\n** [[Greek historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of Alexander the Great]]\n** [[Roman historiography]] \n*** [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of the Cold War]]\n* [[Historiography of the French Revolution]]\n** [[Annales school|''Annales'' school]], in France\n* [[Historiography of Germany]] \n** [[Bielefeld School]], in Germany\n* [[History of India#Historiography]]\n** [[Historiography of the fall of the Mughal Empire]]\n* [[Historiography of early Islam]]\n* [[Historiography of Japan]]\n* [[Historiography of Korea]]\n** [[Korean nationalist historiography]]\n* [[History of Latin America|Latin American History]]\n* [[Middle Ages]]\n** [[Historiography of early Christianity]]\n** [[Historiography of feudalism#Historiography|Historiography of feudalism]]\n** [[Dark Ages (historiography)]]\n** [[Historiography of the Crusades]]\n* [[Historiography and nationalism]]\n* [[Historiography of Switzerland]]\n* [[Historiography in the Soviet Union]]\n* [[Historiography of the United States]]\n** [[Frontier Thesis]]\n* [[Historiography of the United Kingdom]]\n** [[Historiography of Scotland]]\n** [[Historiography of the British Empire]]\n* [[World history]]\n* [[Historiography of the causes of World War I]]\n* [[Historiography of World War II]]\n** [[Historiography of the Battle of France]], 1940\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Theory===\n* Appleby, Joyce, Lynn Hunt & Margaret Jacob, ''Telling the Truth About History''.

Imperial and directly held Hohenstaufen lands in the Empire are shown in bright yellow.]]\nWhen the Salian dynasty ended with Henry V's death in 1125, the princes chose not to elect the next of kin, but rather [[Lothair III, Holy Roman Emperor|Lothair]], the moderately powerful but already old Duke of Saxony. When he died in 1137, the princes again aimed to check royal power; accordingly they did not elect Lothair's favoured heir, his son-in-law [[Henry X, Duke of Bavaria|Henry the Proud]] of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] family, but [[Conrad III of Germany|Conrad III]] of the [[Hohenstaufen]] family, the grandson of Emperor Henry IV and thus a nephew of Emperor Henry V. This led to over a century of strife between the two houses. Conrad ousted the Welfs from their possessions, but after his death in 1152, his nephew [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I \"Barbarossa\"]] succeeded him and made peace with the Welfs, restoring his cousin [[Henry the Lion]] to his \u2013 albeit diminished \u2013 possessions.\n\nThe Hohenstaufen rulers increasingly lent land to ''ministerialia'', formerly non-free servicemen, who Frederick hoped would be more reliable than dukes. Initially used mainly for war services, this new class of people would form the basis for the later [[Imperial Knight|knights]], another basis of imperial power. A further important constitutional move at Roncaglia was the establishment of a new peace mechanism for the entire empire, the [[Landfrieden]], with the first imperial one being issued in 1103 under [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] at [[Mainz]].<ref>Smail, Daniel Lord.

Another new concept of the time was the systematic foundation of new cities by the Emperor and by the local dukes. These were partly caused by the explosion in population, and they also concentrated economic power at strategic locations. Before this, cities had only existed in the form of old Roman foundations or older bishoprics. Cities that were founded in the 12th century include [[Freiburg]], possibly the economic model for many later cities, and [[Munich]].\n\n[[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], also called Frederick Barbarossa, was crowned Emperor in 1155. He emphasized the \"Romanness\" of the empire, partly in an attempt to justify the power of the Emperor independent of the (now strengthened) Pope. An imperial assembly at the fields of Roncaglia in 1158 reclaimed imperial rights in reference to [[Justinian I|Justinian]]'s [[Corpus Juris Civilis]]. Imperial rights had been referred to as ''regalia'' since the Investiture Controversy but were enumerated for the first time at Roncaglia. This comprehensive list included public roads, tariffs, coining, collecting punitive fees, and the investiture or seating and unseating of office holders. These rights were now explicitly rooted in Roman Law, a far-reaching constitutional act.\n\nFrederick's policies were primarily directed at Italy, where he clashed with the increasingly wealthy and free-minded cities of the north, especially [[Milan]]. He also embroiled himself in another conflict with the Papacy by supporting a candidate elected by a minority against [[Pope Alexander III]] (1159\u201381). Frederick supported a succession of [[antipope]]s before finally making peace with Alexander in 1177. In Germany, the Emperor had repeatedly protected Henry the Lion against complaints by rival princes or cities (especially in the cases of [[Munich]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]). Henry gave only lackluster support to Frederick's policies, and in a critical situation during the Italian wars, Henry refused the Emperor's plea for military support. After returning to Germany, an embittered Frederick opened proceedings against the Duke, resulting in a public ban and the confiscation of all his territories. In 1190, Frederick participated in the [[Third Crusade]] and died in the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]].<ref>Hunyadi, Zsolt. Laszlovszky, J\u00f3zsef.

[[Germans|German speaking]] farmers, traders, and craftsmen from the western part of the Empire, both Christians and Jews, moved into these areas. The gradual [[Germanization]] of these lands was a complex phenomenon that should not be interpreted in the biased terms of 19th-century [[nationalism]]. The eastward settlement expanded the influence of the empire to include [[Pomerania]] and [[Silesia]], as did the intermarriage of the local, still mostly Slavic, rulers with German spouses. The [[Teutonic Knights]] were invited to [[Prussia (region)|Prussia]] by Duke [[Konrad of Masovia]] to Christianize the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] in 1226. The [[Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|monastic state of the Teutonic Order]] ({{lang-de|Deutschordensstaat}}) and its later German successor state of [[Prussia]] were, however, never part of the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nUnder the son and successor of Frederick Barbarossa, [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]], the Hohenstaufen dynasty reached its apex. Henry added the Norman kingdom of Sicily to his domains, held English king [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] captive, and aimed to establish a hereditary monarchy when he died in 1197. As his son, [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], though already elected king, was still a small child and living in Sicily, German princes chose to elect an adult king, resulting in the dual election of Frederick Barbarossa's youngest son [[Philip of Swabia]] and Henry the Lion's son [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto of Brunswick]], who competed for the crown. Otto prevailed for a while after Philip was murdered in a private squabble in 1208 until he began to also claim Sicily.\n\n[[File:War flag of the Holy Roman Empire (1200-1350).svg|thumb|left|The ''[[Reichssturmfahne]]'', a military [[banner]] during the 13th and early 14th centuries.]]\n\n[[Pope Innocent III]], who feared the threat posed by a union of the empire and Sicily, now supported by Frederick II, who marched to Germany and defeated Otto. After his victory, Frederick did not act upon his promise to keep the two realms separate. Though he had made his son Henry king of Sicily before marching on Germany, he still reserved real political power for himself. This continued after Frederick was crowned Emperor in 1220. Fearing Frederick's concentration of power, the Pope finally excommunicated the Emperor. Another point of contention was the crusade, which Frederick had promised but repeatedly postponed. Now, although excommunicated, Frederick led the [[Sixth Crusade]] in 1228, which ended in negotiations and a temporary restoration of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.\n\nDespite his imperial claims, Frederick's rule was a major turning point towards the disintegration of central rule in the Empire. While concentrated on establishing a modern, centralized state in Sicily, he was mostly absent from Germany and issued far-reaching privileges to Germany's secular and ecclesiastical princes: In the 1220 ''[[Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis]],'' Frederick gave up a number of ''regalia'' in favour of the bishops, among them tariffs, coining, and fortification. The 1232 ''[[Statutum in favorem principum]]'' mostly extended these privileges to secular territories. Although many of these privileges had existed earlier, they were now granted globally, and once and for all, to allow the German princes to maintain order north of the Alps while Frederick concentrated on Italy. The 1232 document marked the first time that the German dukes were called ''domini terr\u00e6,'' owners of their lands, a remarkable change in terminology as well.\n\n==== Kingdom of Bohemia ====\n[[File:Karte B\u00f6hmische Krone.png|thumb|[[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] since the reign of Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]]]]\nThe [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] was a significant regional power during the [[Middle Ages]]. In 1212, King [[Ottokar I of Bohemia|Ottokar I]] (bearing the title \"king\" since 1198) extracted a [[Golden Bull of Sicily]] (a formal edict) from the emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], confirming the royal title for Ottokar and his descendants and the Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom. Bohemian kings would be exempt from all future obligations to the Holy Roman Empire except for participation in the imperial councils. [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] set [[Prague]] to be the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor.\n\n==== Interregnum ====\n{{main|Interregnum (HRE)}}\nAfter the death of Frederick II in 1250, the German kingdom was divided between his son [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad IV]] (died 1254) and the [[Anti-king#Germany|anti-king]], [[Count William II of Holland|William of Holland]] (died 1256). Conrad's death was followed by the [[Interregnum]], during which no king could achieve universal recognition, allowing the princes to consolidate their holdings and become even more independent rulers. After 1257, the crown was contested between [[Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall|Richard of Cornwall]], who was supported by the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph party]], and [[Alfonso X of Castile]], who was recognized by the Hohenstaufen party but never set foot on German soil. After Richard's death in 1273, the Interregnum ended with the unanimous election of [[Rudolf I of Germany]], a minor pro-Staufen count.\n\n==== Changes in political structure ====\n{{Further|Medieval commune|St\u00e4dtebund|Hanseatic League|Imperial immediacy|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}\n[[File:Schedelsche Weltchronik Struktur des Reiches.jpg|thumb|An illustration from [[Nuremberg Chronicle|Schedelsche Weltchronik]] depicting the structure of the Reich: The Holy Roman Emperor is sitting; on his right are three ecclesiastics; on his left are four secular electors.]]\n\nDuring the 13th century, a general structural change in how land was administered prepared the shift of political power towards the rising [[bourgeoisie]] at the expense of aristocratic [[feudalism]] that would characterize the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Instead of personal duties, money increasingly became the common means to represent economic value in agriculture. Peasants were increasingly required to pay tribute to their lands. The concept of \"property\" began to replace more ancient forms of jurisdiction, although they were still very much tied together. In the territories (not at the level of the Empire), power became increasingly bundled: Whoever owned the land had jurisdiction, from which other powers derived. It is important to note, however, that jurisdiction at this time did not include legislation, which virtually did not exist until well into the 15th century. Court practice heavily relied on traditional customs or rules described as customary.\n\nDuring this time territories began to transform into the predecessors of modern states. The process varied greatly among the various lands and was most advanced in those territories that were almost identical to the lands of the old Germanic tribes, ''e.g.'' Bavaria. It was slower in those scattered territories that were founded through imperial privileges.\n\n=== Late Middle Ages ===\n{{Further|Late Middle Ages|Pomerania during the Late Middle Ages}}\n\n==== Rise of the territories after the Hohenstaufens ====\nThe difficulties in electing the king eventually led to the emergence of a fixed college of [[prince-elector]]s (''Kurf\u00fcrsten''), whose composition and procedures were set forth in the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], which remained valid until 1806. This development probably best symbolizes the emerging duality between emperor and realm (''Kaiser und Reich''), which were no longer considered identical. The Golden Bull also set forth the system for election of the Holy Roman Emperor. The emperor now was to be elected by a majority rather than by consent of all seven electors. For electors the title became hereditary, and they were given the right to mint coins and to exercise jurisdiction. Also their sons were to know the imperial languages \u2013 [[German language|German]], [[Latin]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Czech language|Czech]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Goldene Bulle (Zeumer, 1908) \u2013 Wikisource|url=https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Goldene_Bulle_%28Zeumer,_1908%29|website=de.wikisource.org|accessdate=6 April 2016|language=Latin|quote=Quapropter statuimus, ut illustrium principum, puta regis Boemie, comitis palatini Reni, ducis Saxonie et marchionis Brandemburgensis electorum filii vel heredes et successores, cum verisimiliter Theutonicum ydioma sibi naturaliter inditum scire presumantur et ab infancia didicisse, incipiendo a septimo etatis sue anno in gramatica, Italica ac Sclavica lingwis instruantur, ita quod infra quartum decimum etatis annum existant in talibus iuxta datam sibi a Deo graciam eruditi.}}</ref><ref name=\"langues\">{{cite web|last1=\u017d\u016frek|first1=V\u00e1clav|title=Les langues du roi.

Earlier, the Empire's strength (and finances) greatly relied on the Empire's own lands, the so-called ''Reichsgut'', which always belonged to the king of the day and included many Imperial Cities. After the 13th century, the relevance of the ''Reichsgut'' faded, even though some parts of it did remain until the Empire's end in 1806. Instead, the ''Reichsgut'' was increasingly pawned to local dukes, sometimes to raise money for the Empire, but more frequently to reward faithful duty or as an attempt to establish control over the dukes. The direct governance of the ''Reichsgut'' no longer matched the needs of either the king or the dukes.\n\nThe kings beginning with [[Rudolf I of Germany]] increasingly relied on the lands of their respective dynasties to support their power. In contrast with the ''Reichsgut'', which was mostly scattered and difficult to administer, these territories were relatively compact and thus easier to control. In 1282, Rudolf I thus lent Austria and [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]] to his own sons. In 1312, [[Henry VII, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VII]] of the [[House of Luxembourg]] was crowned as the first Holy Roman Emperor since Frederick II. After him all kings and emperors relied on the lands of their own family (''Hausmacht''): [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] of [[Wittelsbach]] (king 1314, emperor 1328\u201347) relied on his lands in Bavaria; [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] of Luxembourg, the grandson of Henry VII, drew strength from his own lands in Bohemia. It was thus increasingly in the king's own interest to strengthen the power of the territories, since the king profited from such a benefit in his own lands as well.\n\n==== Imperial reform ====\n{{Further|Vehmic court}}\n[[File:HRR 1400.png|thumb|upright=1.15|The Holy Roman Empire in 1400]]\n\nThe \"constitution\" of the Empire still remained largely unsettled at the beginning of the 15th century. Although some procedures and institutions had been fixed, for example by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]], the rules of how the king, the electors, and the other dukes should cooperate in the Empire much depended on the personality of the respective king. It therefore proved somewhat damaging that [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxemburg]] (king 1410, emperor 1433\u20131437) and [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III of Habsburg]] (king 1440, emperor 1452\u20131493) neglected the old core lands of the empire and mostly resided in their own lands. Without the presence of the king, the old institution of the ''[[Hoftag]]'', the assembly of the realm's leading men, deteriorated. The ''[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]]'' as a legislative organ of the Empire did not exist at that time. The dukes often conducted feuds against each other \u2013 feuds that, more often than not, escalated into local wars.\n\nSimultaneously, the Catholic Church experienced crises of its own, with wide-reaching effects in the Empire. The conflict between several papal claimants (two [[anti-popes]] and the \"legitimate\" [[Papacy|Pope]]) ended only with the [[Council of Constance]] (1414\u20131418); after 1419 the Papacy directed much of its energy to suppress the [[Hussites]]. The medieval idea of unifying all [[Christendom]] into a single political entity, with the Church and the Empire as its leading institutions, began to decline.\n\nWith these drastic changes, much discussion emerged in the 15th century about the Empire itself. Rules from the past no longer adequately described the structure of the time, and a reinforcement of earlier ''Landfrieden'' was urgently needed. During this time, the concept of \"reform\" emerged, in the original sense of the Latin verb ''re-formare'' \u2013 to regain an earlier shape that had been lost.\n\nWhen [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] needed the dukes to finance a [[Austrian-Hungarian War (1477\u20131488)|war against Hungary in 1486]], and at the same time had his son (later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]) elected king, he faced a demand from the united dukes for their participation in an Imperial Court. For the first time, the assembly of the electors and other dukes was now called the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') (to be joined by the [[Imperial Free City|Imperial Free Cities]] later). While Frederick refused, his more conciliatory son finally convened the [[Diet at Worms in 1495]], after his father's death in 1493. Here, the king and the dukes agreed on four bills, commonly referred to as the [[Imperial Reform|''Reichsreform'' (Imperial Reform)]]: a set of legal acts to give the disintegrating Empire some structure. For example, this act produced the [[Imperial Circle Estates]] and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), institutions that would \u2013 to a degree \u2013 persist until the end of the Empire in 1806.\n\nHowever, it took a few more decades for the new regulation to gain universal acceptance and for the new court to begin to function effectively; only in 1512 would the Imperial Circles be finalized. The King also made sure that his own court, the ''Reichshofrat'', continued to operate in parallel to the ''Reichskammergericht''. Also in 1512, the Empire received its new title, the ''Heiliges R\u00f6misches Reich Deutscher Nation'' (\"Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation\").\n\n=== Reformation and Renaissance ===\n{{Further|German Reformation|German Renaissance}}\n{{See also|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n\n[[File:Carta itineraria europae 1520 waldseemueller watermarked.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|Carta itineraria europae (by [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller|Waldseem\u00fcller]], 1520 dedicated to Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V.)]]]]\n\nIn 1516, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], grandfather of the future Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], died.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gC8O9GI9JX0C&pg=PA81&dq=Ferdinand+II+of+Aragon+grandfather++Charles+V+died&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0CFoQ6AEwCGoVChMIgOGAosn9yAIVBJAPCh2iWwMA#v=onepage&q=Ferdinand%20II%20of%20Aragon%20grandfather%20%20Charles%20V%20died&f=false ''Historical Dictionary of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation''] by Mullett, Michael (Scarecrow Press, 30 Apr. 2010 {{ISBN|978-0810873933}} p 81).</ref> Due to a combination of (1) the traditions of dynastic succession in Aragon, which permitted maternal inheritance with no precedence for female rule; (2) the insanity of Charles's mother, [[Joanna of Castile]]; and (3) the insistence by his remaining grandfather, [[Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire|Maximilian I]], that he take up his royal titles, Charles initiated his reign in Castile and Aragon, a union which evolved into [[Spanish Crown|Spain]], in conjunction with his mother.  This ensured for the first time that all the realms of what is now Spain would be united by one monarch under one nascent Spanish crown. The founding territories retained their separate governance codes and laws. In 1519, already reigning as ''Carlos I'' in Spain, Charles took up the imperial title as ''Karl V''.  The balance (and imbalance) between these separate inheritances would be defining elements of his reign and would ensure that personal union between the Spanish and German crowns would be short-lived.  The latter would end up going to a more junior branch of the Habsburgs in the person of Charles's brother [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand]], while the senior branch continued to rule in Spain and in the Burgundian inheritance in the person of Charles's son, [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nIn addition to conflicts between his Spanish and German inheritances, conflicts of religion would be another source of tension during the reign of Charles V. Before Charles's reign in the Holy Roman Empire began, in 1517, [[Martin Luther]] launched what would later be known as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. At this time, many local dukes saw it as a chance to oppose the hegemony of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. The empire then became fatally divided along religious lines, with the north, the east, and many of the major cities \u2013 [[Strasbourg]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Nuremberg]] \u2013 becoming [[Protestant]] while the southern and western regions largely remained [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]].\n\n=== Baroque period ===\n{{Main|Germany in the early modern period|Pomerania during the Early Modern Age}}\n{{Further|Baroque|Protestant Union|Catholic League (German)|Thirty Years' War}}\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire ca.1600.svg|upright=1.1|left|thumb|The Holy Roman Empire around 1600, superimposed over current state borders]]\n\nCharles V continued to battle the French and the Protestant princes in Germany for much of his reign. After his son Philip married [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary of England]], it appeared that France would be completely surrounded by Habsburg domains, but this hope proved unfounded when the marriage produced no children. In 1555, [[Pope Paul IV|Paul IV]] was elected pope and took the side of France, whereupon an exhausted Charles finally gave up his hopes of a world Christian empire. He abdicated and divided his territories between Philip and Ferdinand of Austria. The [[Peace of Augsburg]] ended the war in Germany and accepted the existence of [[Protestantism]] in form of [[Lutheranism]], while [[Calvinism]] was still not recognized. [[Anabaptist]], [[Arminian]] and other minor Protestant communities were also forbidden.\n\n[[File:HolyRomanEmpire 1618.png|upright=1.1|thumb|Religion in the Holy Roman Empire on the eve of the [[Thirty Years' War]]]]\n[[File:Holy Roman Empire 1648.svg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Empire after the [[Peace of Westphalia]], 1648]]\n\nGermany would enjoy relative peace for the next six decades. On the eastern front, the Turks continued to loom large as a threat, although war would mean further compromises with the Protestant princes, and so the Emperor sought to avoid it. In the west, the Rhineland increasingly fell under French influence. After the Dutch revolt against Spain erupted, the Empire remained neutral, ''de facto'' allowing the Netherlands to depart the empire in 1581, a secession acknowledged in 1648. A side effect was the [[Cologne War]], which ravaged much of the upper Rhine.\n\nAfter Ferdinand died in 1564, his son [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] became Emperor, and like his father accepted the existence of Protestantism and the need for occasional compromise with it. Maximilian was succeeded in 1576 by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], a strange man who preferred [[Ancient Greek philosophy|classical Greek philosophy]] to Christianity and lived an isolated existence in Bohemia. He became afraid to act when the Catholic Church was forcibly reasserting control in Austria and Hungary, and the Protestant princes became upset over this. Imperial power sharply deteriorated by the time of Rudolf's death in 1612. When Bohemians rebelled against the Emperor, the immediate result was the series of conflicts known as the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u201348), which devastated the Empire. Foreign powers, including France and Sweden, intervened in the conflict and strengthened those fighting Imperial power, but also seized considerable territory for themselves. The long conflict so bled the Empire that it never recovered its strength.\n\nThe actual end of the empire came in several steps. The [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War, gave the territories almost complete independence. [[Calvinism]] was now allowed, but [[Anabaptists]], [[Arminians]] and other Protestant communities would still lack any support and continue to be persecuted well until the end of the Empire. The [[Swiss Confederation]], which had already established quasi-independence in 1499, as well as the [[Northern Netherlands]], left the Empire. The [[Habsburg]] Emperors focused on consolidating their own estates in Austria and elsewhere.\n\nAt the [[Battle of Vienna]] (1683), the [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]], led by the Polish King [[John III Sobieski]], decisively defeated a large Turkish army, stopping the western Ottoman advance and leading to the eventual dismemberment of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe. The army was half forces of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], mostly cavalry, and half forces of the Holy Roman Empire (German/Austrian), mostly infantry.\n\n=== Modern period ===\n{{Main|18th-century history of Germany}}\n\n==== Prussia and Austria ====\n{{Further|Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry|Kingdom of Prussia|Habsburg Monarchy}}\nBy the rise of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Habsburgs were chiefly dependent on their [[Habsburg Monarchy|hereditary lands]] to counter the rise of [[Prussia]]; some of whose territories lay inside the Empire. Throughout the 18th century, the Habsburgs were embroiled in various European conflicts, such as the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the [[War of the Polish Succession]], and the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The [[German dualism]] between [[Austria]] and [[Prussia]] dominated the empire's history after 1740.\n\n==== French Revolutionary Wars and final dissolution ====\n{{Main|Dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire}}\n[[File:HRR 1789 EN.png|thumb|right|upright=1.15|The Empire on the eve of the [[French Revolution]], 1789]]\nFrom 1792 onwards, [[French Revolutionary Wars|revolutionary France]] was at war with various parts of the Empire intermittently.\n\nThe [[German mediatization]] was the series of [[mediatization]]s and [[secularization]]s that occurred between 1795 and 1814, during the latter part of the era of the [[French Revolution]] and then the [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleonic Era]]. \"Mediatization\" was the process of [[annexation|annexing]] the lands of one [[Imperial State|imperial estate]] to another, often leaving the annexed some rights. For example, the estates of the [[Imperial Knight]]s were formally mediatized in 1806, having ''de facto'' been seized by the great [[territorial state]]s in 1803 in the so-called ''[[Rittersturm]]''. \"Secularization\" was the abolition of the temporal power of an [[ecclesiastical]] ruler such as a [[bishop]] or an [[abbot]] and the annexation of the secularized territory to a secular territory.\n\nThe empire was dissolved on 6 August 1806, when the last Holy Roman Emperor [[Francis II of the Holy Roman Empire|Francis II]] (from 1804, Emperor Francis I of Austria) abdicated, following a military defeat by the French under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]] (see [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]). Napoleon reorganized much of the Empire into the [[Confederation of the Rhine]], a [[satellite state|French satellite]]. Francis' [[House of Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] survived the demise of the empire, continuing to reign as [[Emperor of Austria|Emperors of Austria]] and [[King of Hungary|Kings of Hungary]] until the Habsburg empire's final dissolution in 1918 in the [[aftermath of World War I]].\n\nThe Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine was replaced by a new union, the [[German Confederation]], in 1815, following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It lasted until 1866 when Prussia founded the [[North German Confederation]], a forerunner of the [[German Empire]] which united the German-speaking territories outside of Austria and Switzerland under Prussian leadership in 1871. This state developed into [[Federal Republic of Germany|modern Germany]].\n\nThe only princely member state of the Holy Roman Empire that has preserved its status as a monarchy until today is the [[Principality of Liechtenstein]]. The only Free Imperial Cities still being states within Germany are [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]]. All other historic member states of the HRE were either dissolved or are republican successor states to their princely predecessor states.\n\n== Institutions ==\nThe Holy Roman Empire was not a highly centralized state like most countries today. Instead, it was divided into dozens \u2013 eventually hundreds \u2013 of individual entities governed by [[king]]s,<ref>The only prince allowed to call himself \"king\" of a territory in the Empire was the [[King of Bohemia]] (after 1556 usually the Emperor himself). Some other princes were kings by virtue of kingdoms they controlled outside of the Empire</ref> [[duke]]s, [[count]]s, [[bishop]]s, [[abbot]]s, and other rulers, collectively known as [[prince]]s. There were also some areas ruled directly by the Emperor. At no time could the Emperor simply issue decrees and govern autonomously over the Empire. His power was severely restricted by the various local leaders.\n\nFrom the [[High Middle Ages]] onwards, the Holy Roman Empire was marked by an uneasy coexistence of the princes of the local territories who were struggling to take [[power (sociology)|power]] away from it. To a greater extent than in other medieval kingdoms such as [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[Kingdom of England|England]], the Emperors were unable to gain much control over the lands that they formally owned. Instead, to secure their own position from the threat of being deposed, Emperors were forced to grant more and more autonomy to local rulers, both nobles, and bishops. This process began in the 11th century with the [[Investiture Controversy]] and was more or less concluded with the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Several Emperors attempted to reverse this steady dissemination of their authority but were thwarted both by the [[papacy]] and by the princes of the Empire.\n\n=== Imperial estates ===\n{{Main|Imperial State}}\nThe number of territories represented in the Imperial Diet was considerable, numbering about 300 at the time of the [[Peace of Westphalia]]. Many of these ''[[Kleinstaaterei|Kleinstaaten]]'' (\"little states\") covered no more than a few square miles, and/or included several non-contiguous pieces, so the Empire was often called a ''Flickenteppich'' (\"[[Patchwork|patchwork carpet]]\"). \nAn entity was considered a ''Reichsstand'' (imperial estate) if, according to [[feudal law]], it had no authority above it except the Holy Roman Emperor himself. The imperial estates comprised:\n* Territories ruled by a hereditary nobleman, such as a prince, archduke, duke, or count.\n* Territories in which secular authority was held by a clerical dignitary, such as an archbishop, bishop, or abbot. Such a cleric was a [[prince of the church]]. In the common case of a [[prince-bishop]], this temporal territory (called a prince-bishopric) frequently overlapped with his often-larger ecclesiastical [[diocese]], giving the bishop both civil and clerical powers. Examples are the prince-archbishoprics of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]], and [[Archbishopric of Mainz|Mainz]].\n* [[Free imperial city|Free imperial cities]] and [[Imperial Village|Imperial villages]], which were subject only to the jurisdiction of the emperor.\n* The scattered estates of the free [[Imperial Knight]]s and [[Imperial Count]]s, immediate to the Emperor but unrepresented in the Imperial Diet.\n\nA sum total of 1,500 Imperial estates has been reckoned.<ref>Die Reichs-Matrikel aller Kreise Nebst den Usual-Matrikeln des Kaiserlichen und Reichskammergerichts, Ulm 1796.</ref> For a list of ''Reichsst\u00e4nde'' in 1792, see [[List of Imperial Diet participants (1792)]].\n\n=== King of the Romans ===\n{{Main|King of the Romans}}\n[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (189)2.JPG|thumb|The [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown of the Holy Roman Empire]] (2nd half of the 10th century), now held in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]\n\nA prospective Emperor had first to be elected [[King of the Romans]] (Latin: ''Rex Romanorum''; German: ''r\u00f6mischer K\u00f6nig''). [[List of German monarchs|German kings]] had been elected since the 9th century; at that point they were chosen by the leaders of the five most important tribes (the [[Salian Franks]] of [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Ripuarian Franks]] of [[Franconia]], [[Saxons]], [[Bavaria]]ns, and [[Swabia]]ns). In the Holy Roman Empire, the main dukes and bishops of the kingdom elected the King of the Romans. In 1356, Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] issued the [[Golden Bull of 1356|Golden Bull]], which limited the [[prince-elector|electors]] to seven: the [[King of Bohemia]], the [[Count Palatine of the Rhine]],  the [[Duke of Saxony]], the [[Margrave of Brandenburg]], and the archbishops of [[Electorate of Cologne|Cologne]], [[Mainz]], and [[Trier]]. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the [[Duke of Bavaria]] was given the right to vote as the eighth elector, and the [[Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]] (colloquially, Hanover) was granted a ninth electorate; additionally, the Napoleonic Wars resulted in several electorates being reallocated, but these new electors never voted before the Empire's dissolution. A candidate for election would be expected to offer concessions of land or money to the electors in order to secure their vote.\n\nAfter being elected, the King of the Romans could theoretically claim the title of \"Emperor\" only after being crowned by the [[Pope]]. In many cases, this took several years while the King was held up by other tasks: frequently he first had to resolve conflicts in rebellious northern Italy or was quarreling with the Pope himself. Later Emperors dispensed with the papal coronation altogether, being content with the styling ''Emperor-Elect'': the last Emperor to be crowned by the Pope was [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1530.\n\nThe Emperor had to be male and of noble blood. No law required him to be a Catholic, but as the majority of the Electors adhered to this faith, no Protestant was ever elected. Whether and to what degree he had to be German was disputed among the Electors, contemporary experts in constitutional law, and the public. During the Middle Ages, some Kings and Emperors were not of German origin, but since the Renaissance, German heritage was regarded as vital for a candidate in order to be eligible for imperial office.<ref name=\"Hirschi\">Caspar Hirschi, ''Wettkampf der Nationen'', Wallstein Verlag 2005, G\u00f6ttingen, p.&nbsp;393\u2013399.</ref>\n\n=== Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'') ===\n{{Main|Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)}}\n[[File:Balduineum Wahl Heinrich VII.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The Seven [[Prince-elector]]s]]\n\nThe Imperial Diet (''Reichstag'', or ''Reichsversammlung'') was not a legislative body as we understand it today, as its members envisioned it more like a central forum where it was more important to negotiate than to decide.<ref>Klaus Malettke, ''Les relations entre la France et le Saint-Empire au XVIIe si\u00e8cle'', Honor\u00e9 Champion, Paris, 2001, p. 22.</ref> The Diet was theoretically superior to the emperor himself. It was divided into three classes. The first class, the [[Council of Electors]], consisted of the electors, or the princes who could vote for King of the Romans. The second class, the [[Council of Princes]], consisted of the other princes. The Council of Princes was divided into two \"benches\", one for secular rulers and one for ecclesiastical ones. Higher-ranking princes had individual votes, while lower-ranking princes were grouped into \"colleges\" by geography. Each college had one vote.\n\nThe third class was the Council of Imperial Cities, which was divided into two colleges: [[Swabia]] and the [[Rhine]]. The Council of Imperial Cities was not fully equal with the others; it could not vote on several matters such as the admission of new territories. The representation of the Free Cities at the Diet had become common since the late Middle Ages. Nevertheless, their participation was formally acknowledged only as late as in 1648 with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] ending the [[Thirty Years' War]].\n\n=== Imperial courts ===\nThe Empire also had two courts: the ''Reichshofrat'' (also known in English as the [[Aulic Council]]) at the court of the King/Emperor, and the ''[[Reichskammergericht]]'' (Imperial Chamber Court), established with the [[Imperial Reform]] of 1495.\n\n=== Imperial circles ===\n[[File:Map of the Imperial Circles (1512)-en.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of the Empire showing division into Circles in 1512]]\n\nAs part of the Imperial Reform, six [[Imperial Circle]]s were established in 1500; four more were established in 1512. These were regional groupings of most (though not all) of the various states of the Empire for the purposes of defense, imperial taxation, supervision of coining, peace-keeping functions, and public security. Each circle had its own parliament, known as a ''Kreistag'' (\"Circle Diet\"), and one or more directors, who coordinated the affairs of the circle.  Not all imperial territories were included within the imperial circles, even after 1512; the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown]] were excluded, as were [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Switzerland]], the imperial fiefs in northern Italy, the lands of the [[Imperial Knights]], and certain other small territories like the [[Lordship of Jever]].\n\n=== Army ===\n{{Main|Army of the Holy Roman Empire}}\nThe [[Army of the Holy Roman Empire]] (German ''Reichsarmee'', ''Reichsheer'' or ''Reichsarmatur''; Latin ''exercitus imperii'') was created in 1422 and came to an end even before the Empire as the result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. It must not be confused with the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]] (''Kaiserliche Armee'') of the Emperor.\n\nDespite appearances to the contrary, the Army of the Empire did not constitute a permanent [[standing army]] that was always at the ready to fight for the Empire. When there was danger, an Army of the Empire was mustered from among the elements constituting it,<ref>Andr\u00e9 Corvisier, John Childs, ''A dictionary of military history and the art of war'' (1994), p. 306</ref> in order to conduct an imperial military campaign or ''Reichsheerfahrt''. In practice, the imperial troops often had local allegiances stronger than their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\n=== Administrative centres ===\n[[Aulic Council|''Reichshofrat'']] resided in [[Vienna]].\n\n''[[Reichskammergericht ]]'' resided in [[Worms]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Regensburg]], [[Speyer]] and [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]] before it was moved permanently to [[Wetzlar]].\n\n[[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|''Reichstag'']] resided variously in [[Paderborn]], [[Bad Lippspringe]], [[Ingelheim am Rhein]], [[Diedenhofen]] (now [[Thionville]]), [[Aachen]], [[Worms]], [[Forchheim]], [[Trebur]], [[Fritzlar]], [[Ravenna]], [[Quedlinburg]], [[Dortmund]], [[Verona]], [[Minden]], [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Merseburg]], [[Goslar]], [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Bamberg]], [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Quierzy-sur-Oise]], [[Speyer]], [[Gelnhausen]], [[Erfurt]], [[Cheb|Eger]] (now [[Cheb]]), [[Esslingen am Neckar|Esslingen]], [[Lindau]], [[Freiburg]], [[Cologne]], [[Konstanz]] and [[Trier]] before it was moved permanently to [[Regensburg]].\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire never had a [[capital city]]. Usually, the Holy Roman Emperor ruled from a place of his own choice. This was called an imperial seat. Seats of the Holy Roman Emperor included: [[Aachen]] (from 794), [[Munich]] (1328\u20131347 and 1744\u20131745), [[Prague]] (1355\u20131437 and 1576\u20131611), [[Vienna]] (1438\u20131576, 1611\u20131740 and 1745\u20131806) and [[Frankfurt am Main]] (1742\u20131744) among other cities.\n\n[[Imperial election]]s were mostly held in Frankfurt am Main, but also took place in [[Augsburg]], [[Rhens]], [[Cologne]] and [[Regensburg]]. Going as far as into the 16th century, the elected Holy Roman Emperor was then [[Coronation of the Holy Roman Emperor|crowned]] and [[Papal appointment|appointed by the Pope]] in [[Rome]], but individual coronations also happened in [[Ravenna]], [[Bologna]] and [[Reims]].\n\n== Demographics ==\n===Population===\nOverall population figures for the Holy Roman Empire are extremely vague and vary widely. Given the political fragmentation of the Empire, there were no central agency that could compile such figures. According to an overgenerous contemporary estimate of the  Austrian War Archives for the first decade of the 18th century, the Empire, including Bohemia and the Spanish Netherlands had a population of close to 28 million with a breakdown as follow:<ref>G. Benecke, ''Society and Politics in Germany, 1500\u20131750'', Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1974, p. 162.</ref>\n\n- 65 ecclesiastical states with 14 per cent of the total land area and 12 per cent of the population;<br>\n- 45 dynastic principalities with 80 per cent of the land and 80 per cent of the population;<br>\n- 60 dynastic counties and lordships with 3 per cent of the land and 3.5 per cent of the population;<br>\n- 60 imperial towns with 1 per cent of the land and 3.5 per cent of the population;<br>\n- Imperial knights' territories, numbering into the several hundreds, with 2 per cent of the land and 1 per cent of the population.\n\nGerman demographic historians have traditionally worked on estimates of the population of the Holy Roman Empire based on assumed population within the frontiers of Germany in 1871 or 1914. More recent estimates use less outdated criteria, but they remain guesswork. One estimate based on the frontiers of Germany in 1870 gives a population of some 15\u201317 million around 1600, declined to 10\u201313 million around 1650 (following the Thirty Years' War). Other historians who work on estimates of the population of the early modern Empire suggest the population declined from 20 million to some 16\u201317 million by 1650.<ref>Whaley, vol. I, p. 633.</ref>\n\nA credible estimate for 1800 gives 27 million inhabitants for the Empire, with an overall breakdown as follow:<ref>Whaley, vol. II, p. 351.</ref>\n\n- 9 million Austrian subjects (including Silesia, Bohemia and Moravia);<br>\n- 4 million Prussian subjects;<br>\n- 14\u201315 million inhabitants for the rest of the Empire.\n\n=== Largest cities ===\nLargest cities or towns of the Empire by year:\n* '''1050''': [[Regensburg]] 40,000 people.

Generally, holidays are intended to allow individuals to celebrate or commemorate an event or tradition of cultural or religious significance. Holidays may be designated by governments, religious institutions, or other groups or organizations. The degree to which normal activities are reduced by a holiday may depend on local laws, customs, the type of job held or personal choices.\n\nThe concept of holidays often originated in connection with religious observances.  The intention of a holiday was typically to allow individuals to tend to religious duties associated with important dates on the calendar. In most modern societies, however, holidays serve as much of a recreational function as any other weekend days or activities.\n\nIn many societies there are important distinctions between holidays designated by governments and holidays designated by religious institutions. For example, in many predominantly Christian nations, government-designed holidays may center on Christian holidays, though non-Christians may instead observe religious holidays associated with their faith. In some cases, a holiday may only be nominally observed. For example, many Jews in the Americas and Europe treat the relatively minor Jewish holiday of [[Hanukkah]] as a \"working holiday\", changing very little of their daily routines for this day.\n\nThe word ''holiday'' has differing connotations in different regions. In the [[United States]] the word is used exclusively to refer to the nationally, religiously or culturally observed day(s) of rest or celebration, or the events themselves, whereas in the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[Commonwealth nations]], the word may refer to the period of time where leave from one\u2019s duties has been agreed, and is used as a synonym to the US preferred ''[[vacation]]''. This time is usually set aside for rest, travel or the participation in recreational activities, with entire industries targeted to coincide or enhance these experiences. The days of leave may not coincide with any specific customs or laws. Employers and educational institutes may designate \u2018holidays\u2019 themselves which may or may not overlap nationally or culturally relevant dates, which again comes under this connotation, but it is the first implication detailed that this article is concerned with.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe word ''holiday'' comes from the [[Old English]] word ''h\u0101ligd\u00e6g'' (''h\u0101lig'' \"[[holy]]\" + ''d\u00e6g'' \"[[day]]\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/?term=holiday|title=holiday - Origin and meaning of holiday by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The word originally referred only to special religious days. In modern use, it means any special day of rest or relaxation, as opposed to normal days away from work or school.\n\n==Types of holiday (observance)==\n{{Further|Lists of holidays}}\n\n===Northern Hemisphere winter holidays===\n{{Main|Christmas and holiday season}}\n\nWinter in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] features many holidays that involve [[List of winter festivals|festivals and feasts]]. The Christmas and holiday season surrounds the [[Christmas]] and other holidays, and is celebrated by many religions and cultures. Usually, this period begins near the start of November and ends with [[New Year's Day]]. ''Holiday season'' in the US, to the period that begins with Thanksgiving and ends with New Year's Eve. Some [[Christianity|Christian]] countries consider the end of the festive season to be after the feast of [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]].\n\n===National holidays===\n{{See also|National Day}}\n[[sovereignty|Sovereign]] nations and territories observe holidays based on events of significance to their history. For example, Americans celebrate [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], celebrating the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] in 1776.\n\n===Other secular holidays===\n{{Category see also|Secular holidays}}\nOther [[secular]] (non-religious) holidays are observed nationally, [[International observance|internationally]] (often in conjunction with organizations such as the [[United Nations]]), and across multi-country regions. The United Nations Calendar of Observances<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/events/observances/days.shtml|title=International Days|accessdate=August 10, 2018|publisher=United Nations}}</ref> dedicates decades to a specific topic, but also a complete year, month, week and days.  Holidays dedicated to an observance such as the commemoration of the ending of [[World War II]], or the [[Shoah]], can also be part of the [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparation]] obligation as per UN  OHCHR Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/RemedyAndReparation.aspx|title=Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law|date=December 16, 2005|accessdate=August 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n\nAnother example of a major secular holiday is the [[Lunar New Year]], which is celebrated across Asia. Many other days are marked to celebrate events or people, but are not strictly holidays as time off work is rarely given; examples include [[Arbor Day]] (originally U.S.), [[Labor Day]] (celebrated sometimes under different names and on different days in different countries), and [[Earth Day]] (22 April).\n\n===Unofficial holidays===\n{{See also|List of minor secular observances}}\nThese are holidays that are not traditionally marked on calendars. These holidays are celebrated by various groups and individuals. Some promote a cause, others recognize historical events not officially recognized, and others are \"funny\" holidays celebrated with humorous intent. For example, [[Monkey Day]] is celebrated on December 14, [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]] is observed on September 19, and [[Blasphemy Day]] is held on September 30. Other examples are [[April Fool's Day]] on April 1 and [[Liberation Day (Expatriates)]] on May 31. Various community organizers and marketers promote odd [[social media holiday|social media holidays]].\n\n===Religious holidays===\n\nMany holidays are linked to [[faith]]s and [[religion]]s (see etymology above). [[Christian]] holidays are defined as part of the [[liturgical year]], the chief ones being [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]]. The Orthodox Christian and Western-Roman Catholic [[fiesta patronal|patronal feast day or \"name day\"]] are celebrated in each place's patron saint's day, according to the [[Calendar of saints]]. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] annually commemorate \"The Memorial of Jesus Christ's Death\", but do not celebrate other holidays with any religious significance such as Easter, Christmas or New Year's. This holds especially true for those holidays that have combined and absorbed rituals, overtones or practices from non-Christian beliefs into the celebration, as well as those holidays that distract from or replace the worship of Jehovah.<ref>Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. ''Reasoning from the Scriptures''.

My Uncle Toby on his Hobby-horse.jpg|right|thumb|The origin of the word hobby in [[Tristram Shandy]], a characters' \"hobby-horses\", or particular obsessions ]]\n\nA '''hobby''' is a regular activity that is done for enjoyment, typically during one's leisure time. Hobbies can include [[collecting]] themed items and objects, engaging in creative and artistic pursuits, playing sports, or pursuing other amusements. A [[list of hobbies]] is lengthy and always changing as interests and fashions change. By continually participating in a particular hobby, one can acquire substantial skills and knowledge in that area. Engagement in hobbies has increased since the late nineteenth century as workers have more leisure time and advancing production and technology have provided more support for leisure activities. Hobbies tend to follow trends in society, for example [[stamp collecting]] was popular during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as postal systems were the main means of communication, while [[video games]] are more popular nowadays following technological advances.\n\nHobbyists are a part of a wider group of people engaged in [[leisure#Types of leisure|leisure]] pursuits where the boundaries of each group overlap to some extent. The ''Serious Leisure Perspective''<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|url = http://www.seriousleisure.net/|website = The Serious Leisure Perspective (SLP)|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref> groups hobbyists with amateurs and volunteers and identifies three broad groups of leisure activity with hobbies being found mainly in the Serious leisure category.\n\n''a. Casual leisure'' is intrinsically rewarding, short-lived, pleasurable activity requiring little or no preparation.\n\n''b. Serious leisure'' is the systematic pursuit of an amateur, hobbyist, or volunteer that is substantial, rewarding and results in a sense of accomplishment.\n\n''c. Project-based leisure'' is a short-term often a one-off project that is rewarding.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Serious Leisure \u2013 A Perspective for Our Time, Transaction Publishers, 2015,|last = Stebbins|first = Robert|publisher = Transaction Publishers|year = 2015|isbn = |location = New Brunswick|pages = }}</ref>\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[File:Wikipedian at otium.jpg|thumb|Writing articles for Wikipedia is a hobby for some people.]]\nIn the 16th century, the term \"hobyn\" had the meaning of \"small horse and pony\". The term \"[[Hobby horse (toy)|hobby horse]]\" was documented in a 1557 payment confirmation for a \"Hobbyhorse\" from Reading, England.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hobby-horse|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/hobby-horse.html|work=The Phrase Finder|publisher=Gary Martin|accessdate=5 May 2012|author=The Phrase Finder|year=1996\u20132012}}</ref> The item, originally called a \"Tourney Horse\", was made of a wooden or basketwork frame with an artificial tail and head. It was designed for a child to mimic riding a real [[Horses in the Middle Ages#Hobbies|horse]]. By 1816 the [[wikt:derivative|derivative]], \"hobby\", was introduced into the [[vocabulary]] of a number of English people.<ref>{{cite web|title=hobby|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=hobby|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=Douglas Harper|accessdate=5 May 2012|author=Douglas Harper|authorlink=Douglas Harper|year=2001\u20132012}}</ref> Over the course of subsequent centuries, the term came to be associated with [[recreation]] and [[leisure]].  In the 17th century, the term was used in a [[pejorative]] sense by suggesting that a hobby was a childish pursuit, however, in the 18th century with a more industrial society and more leisure time, hobbies took on greater respectability<ref>Gelber S M. '\u2019Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America\u2019\u2019 Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 11.</ref> A hobby is also called a '''pastime''', derived from the use of hobbies to pass the time. A hobby became an activity that is practised regularly and usually with some worthwhile purpose.<ref name=\"Gelber S M 1999, p. 12\">Gelber S M. \u2018\u2019Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America\u2019\u2019 Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 12.</ref> Hobbies are usually, but not always, practised primarily for interest and enjoyment, rather than financial reward.\n\n==History==\nThe origins  pursuits that others thought somewhat childish or trivial. However, as early as 1676 Sir Matthew Hale, in  ''Contemplations Moral and Divine'', wrote \"Almost every person hath some hobby horse or other wherein he prides himself.\"<ref name=\"Hale1676\">{{cite book|author=Sir Matthew Hale|title=Contemplations moral and divine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cL1AAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP5|year=1676|publisher=Printed by William Godbid, for William Shrowbury at the Bible in Duke-Lane, and John Leigh at the Blew Bell Fleet Street near Chancery-lane|pages=201}}</ref> He was acknowledging that a \"hobby horse\" produces a legitimate sense of pride. By the mid 18th century there was a flourishing of hobbies as working people had more regular hours of work and greater leisure time. They spent more time to pursue interests that brought them satisfaction.<ref>Gelber S M. '\u2019Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America\u2019\u2019 Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 3.</ref> However, there was concern that these working people might not use their leisure time in worthwhile pursuits. \"The hope of weaning people away from bad habits by the provision of counter-attractions came to the fore in the 1830s, and has rarely waned since. Initially the bad habits were perceived to be of a sensual and physical nature, and the counter attractions, or perhaps more accurately alternatives, deliberately cultivated rationality and the intellect.\"<ref>Thomson F M L. \u2018\u2019The Cambridge Social History of Britain, 1750\u20131950 Vol 2\u2019\u2019. Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 327</ref> The flourishing book and magazine trade of the day encouraged worthwhile hobbies and pursuits. The burgeoning manufacturing trade made materials used in hobbies cheap and was responsive to the changing interests of hobbyists.\n\nThe English have been identified as enthusiastic hobbyists, as George Orwell observed. \"[A]nother English characteristic which is so much a part of us that we barely notice it \u2026 is the addiction to hobbies and spare-time occupations, the privateness of English life. We are a nation of flower-lovers, but also a nation of stamp-collectors, pigeon-fanciers, amateur carpenters, coupon-snippers, darts-players, crossword-puzzle fans. All the culture that is most truly native centres round things which even when they are communal are not official\u2014the pub, the football match, the back garden, the fireside and the 'nice cup of tea'.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Orwell|first=George|date=28 February 1941|title=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism and the English Genius.|url=http://orwell.ru/library/essays/lion/english/e_eye|journal=England Your England|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}</ref>\n\nDeciding what to include in a [[list of hobbies]] provokes debate because it is difficult to decide which pleasurable pass-times can also be described as hobbies. During the 20th century the term hobby usually brought to mind activities such as stamp collecting, embroidery, knitting, painting, woodwork, photography, but not activities like listening to music, watching television or reading. These latter activities bring pleasure but lack the sense of achievement that is usually associated with a hobby. They are usually not structured, organised pursuits, as most hobbies are. The pleasure of a hobby is usually associated with making something of value or achieving something of value. \"Such leisure is socially valorised precisely because it produces feelings of satisfaction with something that looks very much like work but that is done of its own sake.\"<ref name=\"Gelber S M 1999, p. 12\"/> \"Hobbies are a contradiction: they take work and turn it into leisure, and take leisure and turn it into work.\"<ref>Gelber S M. \u2018\u2019Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America\u2019\u2019 Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 23.</ref>\n\n== Hobbies and related leisure activities ==\nThe terms amateur and hobbyist are often used interchangeably. Stebbins<ref name=\":0\" /> has a framework which distinguishes the terms has a useful categorisation of leisure in which he separates ''casual leisure''  from ''serious Leisure''. He describes serious leisure as undertaken by ''amateurs'', ''hobbyists'' and ''volunteers''. ''Amateurs'' engage in pursuits that have a professional counterpart, such as playing an instrument or astronomy. '''Hobbyists''' engage in five broad types of activity: ''collecting'', ''making and tinkering'' (like embroidery and car restoration), ''activity participation'' (like fishing and singing), ''sports and games'', and ''liberal-arts'' hobbies (like languages, cuisine, literature). '''Volunteers''' commit to  organisations where they work as guides, counsellors, gardeners and so on. The separation of the amateur from the hobbyist is because the amateur has the ethos of the professional practitioner as a guide to practice. An amateur clarinetist is conscious of the role and procedures of a professional clarinetist.\n\nA large proportion of hobbies are mainly solitary in nature.<ref>Gelber S M. \u2018\u2019Hobbies: leisure and the Culture of Work in America\u2019\u2019 Columbia University Press, 1999, p. 28.</ref> However, individual pursuit of a hobby often includes club memberships, organised sharing of products and regular communication between participants. For many hobbies there is an important role in being in touch with fellow hobbyists. Some hobbies are of communal nature, like choral singing and volunteering.\n\nDuring the 20th century there was extensive research into the important role that [[play (activity)|play]] has in human development. While most evident in childhood, play continues throughout life for many adults in the form of games, hobbies, and sport.<ref>Carlisle R P Ed, '\u2019Encyclopedia of Play in Today's Society Vol 1'\u2019, SAGE Publications, 2009 page x</ref>\n\nThe type of hobbies that people engage in changes with time. In the 21st century the video game industry is very large hobby involving millions of kids and adults in various forms of 'play'. [[Stamp collecting]] has declined along with the decline in the importance of the postal system. [[Woodwork]] and [[knitting]] have declined as hobbies as manufactured goods provide cheap alternatives for handmade goods. Through the internet an [[online community]] has become a hobby for many people; sharing advice, information and support, and in some cases, allowing a traditional hobby, such as [[collecting]], to flourish and support trading in a new environment.\n\nPeople who engage in hobbies have an interest in and time to pursue them. Children have been an important group of hobbyists because they are enthusiastic for collecting, making and exploring, in addition to this they have the leisure time that allows them to pursue those hobbies. The growth in hobbies occurred during industrialisation which gave workers set time for leisure. During the Depression there was an increase in the participation in hobbies because the unemployed had the time and a desire to be purposefully occupied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gelber|first1=Steven|title=A Job You Can't Lose: Work and Hobbies in the Great Depression|jstor=3788855|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> Hobbies are often pursued with an increased interest by retired people because they have the time and seek the intellectual and physical stimulation a hobby provides. Studies of [[ageing and society#Successful ageing|ageing and society]] support the value of hobbies in healthy ageing.\n\n== Types of hobbies==\n{{Mainlist|List of hobbies }}Hobbies are a diverse set of activities and it is difficult to categorize them in a logical manner. The following categorization of hobbies was developed by Stebbins.<ref name=\":1\" /> {{Collecting Hobby}}\n\n=== Collecting ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main article|Collecting}}\nCollecting includes seeking, locating, acquiring, organizing, cataloging, displaying and storing. Collecting is appealing to many people due to their interest in a particular subject and a desire to categorise and make order out of complexity. Some collectors are generalists, accumulating items from countries of the world. Others focus on a subtopic within their area of interest, perhaps 19th century postage stamps, [[milk bottle]] labels from Sussex, or Mongolian harnesses and tack. \n[[File:Stamp album sleeve.jpg|right|thumb|alt=text|A [[stamp album]] used in [[stamp collecting]].]]\n\nCollecting is an ancient hobby, with the [[list of coin collectors]] showing [[Caesar Augustus]] as one. Sometimes collectors have turned their hobby into a business, becoming commercial dealers that trade in the items being collected.\n\nAn alternative to collecting physical objects is collecting records of events of a particular kind. Examples include [[train spotting]], [[bird-watching]], [[aircraft spotting]], [[railfan]]s, and any other form of systematic recording a particular phenomenon. The recording form can be written, photographic, online, etc.\n\n=== Making and tinkering ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n'''[[Scale model]]ing''' is making a replica of a real life object in a smaller scale and dates back to prehistoric times with small clay \"dolls\" and other children's toys that have been found near known populated areas. The [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Greeks]], and [[Roman Empire|Romans]] took the form to a greater depth during their years of domination of the Western World, using scale replicas of enemy [[fortification]]s, coastal defense lines, and other geographic fixtures to plan battles.\n\nAt the turn of the Industrial Age and through the 1920s, families could afford things such as [[Rail transport modelling|electric trains]], wind-up toys (typically boats or cars) and the increasingly valuable tin toy soldiers.\n\n[[Model engineering]] refers to building functioning machinery in metal, such as [[internal combustion]] motors and [[live steam]] models or locomotives. This is a demanding hobby that requires a multitude of large and expensive tools, such as [[lathe]]s and [[Milling machine|mill]]s. This hobby originated in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century, later spreading and flourishing in the mid-20th century. Due to the expense and space required, it is becoming rare.\n\nScale modeling as we know it today became popular shortly after [[World War II]]. Before 1946, children as well as adults were content in carving and shaping wooden replicas from block wood kits, often depicting enemy aircraft to help with identification in case of an invasion.\n\n[[File:Z scale miniature railroad.jpg|thumb|400px|A coffee-table sized [[Rail transport modelling|model railroad]]]]\n\nWith the advent of modern plastics, the amount of skill required to get the basic shape accurately shown for any given subject was lessened, making it easier for people of all ages to begin assembling replicas in varying scales. Superheroes, aeroplanes, boats, cars, tanks, artillery, and even figures of soldiers became quite popular subjects to build, paint and display. Although almost any subject can be found in almost any scale, there are common scales for such miniatures which remain constant today. \n\n[[3D printing|'''3D Printing''']] is a relatively new technology and already a major hobby as the cost of printers has fallen sharply. It is a good example of how hobbyists quickly engage with new technologies, communicate with one another and become producers related to their former hobby. [[3D modeling]] is the process of making mathematical representations of three dimensional items and is an aspect of 3D printing.\n\n'''[[Dressmaker|Dressmaking]]''' has been a major hobby up until the late 20th century, in order to make cheap clothes, but also as a creative design and craft challenge. It has been reduced by the low cost manufactured clothes.\n\n'''Cooking''' is for some people an interest, a hobby, a challenge and a source of significant satisfaction. For many other people it is a job, a chore, a duty, like cleaning. In the early 21st century the importance of cooking as a hobby was demonstrated by the high popularity of competitive television cooking programs.\n\n====Gardening====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main article|Gardening}}[[File:gardening.jpg|thumb|right|Gardening]]\n[[Residential garden]]ing most often takes place in or about one's own residence, in a space referred to as the '''garden'''. Although a garden typically is located on the land near a residence, it may also be located on a [[roof garden|roof]], in an [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], on a [[balcony]], in a [[windowbox]], or on a [[patio garden|patio]] or [[vivarium]].\n\nGardening also takes place in non-residential green areas, such as parks, public or semi-public gardens ([[botanical garden]]s or [[zoological garden]]s), [[amusement park|amusement]] and [[theme park]]s, along transportation corridors, and around [[tourism|tourist attractions]] and [[garden hotels|hotels]]. In these situations, a staff of [[gardener]]s or [[groundskeeper]]s maintains the gardens.[[File:Indoor garden.jpg|thumb|A variety of flowers and vegetables in an indoor garden.]]\nIndoor gardening is growing [[houseplant]]s within a [[House|residence]] or building, in a [[conservatory (greenhouse)|conservatory]], or in a [[greenhouse]]. [[Indoor garden]]s are sometimes incorporated into [[air conditioning]] or heating systems.\n\nWater gardening is growing plants that have adapted to pools and ponds. [[Bog]] gardens are also considered a type of water garden. These all require special conditions and considerations. A simple water garden may consist solely of a tub containing the water and plant(s).\n\nContainer gardening is concerned with growing plants in containers that are placed above the ground.\n\n==== Tinkering ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\nTinkering is 'dabbling' with the making process, often applied to the hobby of tinkering with car repairs, and various kinds of restoration: of furniture, [[antique car]]s, etc. It also applies to household tinkering: repairing a wall, laying a pathway, etc.\n\nMaking and Tinkering hobbies also include higher-end projects like building or restoring a car, or building a computer from individual parts, like CPUs and SSDs.\nFor computer savvy do-it-yourself hobbyists, CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining is also popular. A CNC machine can be assembled and programmed to make different parts from wood or metal.\n\n=== Activity Participation ===\n\n====Outdoor recreation====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n{{Main article|Outdoor recreation}}[[Outdoor pursuits]] are the group of [[Action (philosophy)|activities]] which occur [[outdoor]]s. These hobbies include gardening, [[hill walking]], [[hiking]], [[Backpacking (wilderness)|backpacking]], cycling, [[canoeing]], [[climbing]], [[caving]], fishing, [[hunting]], [[wildlife viewing]] (as [[birdwatching]]) and engaging in [[Water sport (recreation)|watersport]]s and [[Winter sport|snowsport]]s.\n\nDepending on an individual's desired level of adrenaline, outdoors experiences are considered one type of hobby. While many enjoy an adrenaline rush or just an escape from reality, outdoor recreational activities can also be an extremely effective medium in education and [[team building]].<ref>{{cite web|title=6 Ways to Find a New Hobby|url=https://www.thriftycrates.com/6-ways-to-find-a-new-hobby/|website=Thrifty Crates|publisher=Thrifty Crates|accessdate=25 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs interest increases, so has the desire for commercial outdoor pursuits. Outdoor recreational supply stores have opened in large numbers and are thriving, as have outdoor pursuit journalism and magazines, both on paper and the Internet.\n\nThe increased accessibility of outdoor pursuit resources has been the source of some negative publicity over the years, with complaints of the destruction of [[landscape]]. An example is the destruction of hillsides as [[trail|footpath]]s are eroded due to an excessive number of visitors.\n\n=== Liberal arts pursuits ===\n{{Main article|Liberal arts education}}\n{{Main article|The arts}}\n[[File:Magicianatparty.jpg|thumb|An amateur magician performing.]]\nMany hobbies involve performances by the hobbyist, such as singing, acting, [[juggling]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], dancing, playing a [[musical instrument]], [[martial arts]] and other [[performing arts]].\n\nSome hobbies may result in an end product.  Examples of this would be woodworking, photography, [[moviemaking]], [[jewellery making|jewelry making]], software projects such as [[Photoshopping]] and home music or [[video production]], making [[friendship bracelets|bracelets]], [[art|artistic projects]] such as drawing, painting, writing..., Cosplay (design, creation, and wearing a costume based on an already existing creative property), creating models out of card stock or paper \u2013 called [[papercraft]].  Many of these fall under the category [[visual arts]].\n\n[[Reading (process)|Reading]], books, [[ebook]]s, magazines, comics, or newspapers, along with browsing the internet is a common hobby, and one that can trace its origins back hundreds of years. A love of literature, later in life, may be sparked by an interest in reading children's literature as a child.  Many of these fall under the category [[literary arts]].\n\n===Sports and games===\n{{Main article|Sport}}{{Main article|Game}}Stebbins<ref name=\":1\" /> makes a distinction between an amateur sports person playing a sport that has a professional equivalent such as football or tennis and a hobbyist playing a less formal sport or game that are rule bound but have no professional equivalent like [[deck tennis]] and long distance trekking. Amateur sport ranges from very informal play to highly competitive practice.\n\nEvidence suggests that playing sports helps improve physical and mental health.<ref>{{cite web|title=Analysis of health and educational benefits of sport and culture|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/analysis-of-health-and-educational-benefits-of-sport-and-culture|website=gov.uk|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Significant achievements by hobbyists and amateurs ==\nThere have been many instances where hobbyists and amateurs have achieved significant discoveries and developments. These are a small sample. \n* Amateur astronomers have explored the skies for centuries and there is a long list of [[Amateur astronomy#Notable amateur astronomers|Notable amateur astronomers]] who have made major discoveries. \n* A substantial amount of early scientific research came from the amateur activities of the wealthy, such as [[Antoine Lavoisier]]'s contributions to the science of [[chemistry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/antoine-laurent-lavoisier|title=Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier |publisher=Science History Institute |accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref> At that time there were few professional scientists and little formal study in the area. Another example is the [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|experimentation in electricity]] that [[Benjamin Franklin]] undertook that resulted in his invention of the [[lightning rod]].{{sfn|Turner|2014|p=233}} \n* [[Open source]] is a development model using the internet to cooperate on projects. It is most notable in the development of software and [[Open-source software#Widely used open-source software|widely used software]] has been developed and maintained by large numbers of people programming collectively. Many of these contributors are professional programmers, but a proportion are home-based amateurs, often with high level expertise. Open source contributes to many other projects, including those of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] and notably the Wikipedia where thousands of hobbyists have built the most used reference source in the world. The highly significant [[Linux]] computer operating system began as a student's hobby by [[Linus Torvalds]]. Linux is Linus plus X representing Unix upon which it was based. \n* While the general public was not aware of nature observation which was formally conducted as [[field research]], during the 1930s, practitioners of the hobby went on to become the [[wikt:pioneer|pioneers]] of the [[conservation movement]] that flourished in the UK from 1965 onwards. Eventually, it became a global [[political movement]] within a generation's time span.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Avocation]]\n*[[Community of interest]]\n*[[List of hobbies]]\n*Personal life\n*[[Play (activity)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote-inline|hobby}}\n{{Wiktionary-inline|hobby}}\n{{Wiktionary-inline|pastime}}\n\n[[Category:Hobbies| ]]", "sha1": "fiy14gmg5i72z6895tzcidjg8kva6xc"}}, {"title": "Holland", "ns": "0", "id": "13288", "revision": {"id": "862097962", "parentid": "862097840", "timestamp": "2018-10-02T04:50:22Z", "contributor": {"ip": "125.25.13.250"}, "comment": "/* Etymology and terminology */", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{short description|Region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands}}\n{{About|the region in the Netherlands, not the country itself|the country of the Netherlands as a whole|Netherlands}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox settlement\n|name =Holland\n|image_map = Holland position.svg\n|map_caption = [[North Holland|North]] and [[South Holland]] (in orange) shown together within the [[Netherlands]]\n|subdivision_type = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name = {{flag|Netherlands}}\n|parts_type = Largest settlements\n|p1 = [[Amsterdam]] |p2 = [[Rotterdam]] |p3 = [[The Hague]] |p4 = [[Haarlem]] |p5 = [[Zoetermeer]] |p6 = [[Dordrecht]] |p7 = [[Leiden]]\n|area_total_km2 = 5488\n|population_as_of = May 2018\n|population_footnotes = <ref>{{nl}} [http://statline.cbs.nl/Statweb/publication/?DM=SLNL&PA=37230ned&D1=0-2,4-5,7-8,13-17&D2=0,4,8,12-13,30,77&D3=195-206,208-212&HDR=G2&STB=G1,T&VW=T] Statline CBS: Bevolkingsontwikkeling per maand</ref>\n|population_total = 6,526,841\n|population_density_km2 = auto\n|population_demonym = Hollander\n|timezone1 = [[Central European Time|CET]]\n|utc_offset1 = +1\n|timezone1_DST = [[Central European Summer Time|CEST]]\n|utc_offset1_DST = +2\n}}\n\n'''Holland''' is a region and former province on the western coast of the [[Netherlands]].

By the 17th century, the province of Holland had risen to become a maritime and economic power, dominating the other provinces of the newly independent [[Dutch Republic]].\n\nThe area of the former [[County of Holland]] roughly coincides with the two current Dutch [[Provinces of the Netherlands|provinces]] of [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in which it was divided, which together include the Netherlands' three largest cities: the ''de jure'' [[Capital of the Netherlands|capital city]] of [[Amsterdam]]; [[Rotterdam]], home of [[Port of Rotterdam|Europe's largest port]]; and the [[seat of government]] of [[The Hague]].\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\nThe name ''Holland'' first appeared in sources for the region around [[Haarlem]], and by 1064 was being used as the name of the entire county. By the early twelfth century, the inhabitants of Holland were called ''Hollandi'' in a [[Latin]] text.<ref>Antheun Janse, \"Een zichzelf verdeeld rijk\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 1, p. 73</ref> ''Holland'' is derived from the [[Old Dutch]] term ''holtlant'' (\"wood-land\").<ref name=Oxford>''Oxford English Dictionary'', \"Holland, n.1,\" etymology.</ref> This spelling variation remained in use until around the 14th century, at which time the name stabilised as ''Holland'' (alternative spellings at the time were ''Hollant'' and ''Hollandt''). A popular [[folk etymology]] holds that ''Holland'' is derived from ''hol land'' (\"hollow land\") and was inspired by the [[lowland|low-lying]] [[geography]] of Holland.<ref name=Oxford/>\n\nThe proper name of the area in both Dutch and English is \"Holland\". Holland is a part of the Netherlands. \"Holland\" is informally used in [[English language|English]] and other languages, including sometimes the [[Dutch language]] itself, to mean the whole of the modern country of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Netherlands]].<ref name=MoFA/> This example of ''[[pars pro toto]]'' or [[synecdoche]] is similar to the tendency to refer to the United Kingdom as \"England\",<ref>\"The majority of English people still behave as if 'English' and 'British' are synonymous\", historian [[Norman Davies]] quoted in [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/255337.stm The English: Europe's lost tribe], BBC News Story, January 14, 1999</ref><ref>George Mikes, ''How to be an Alien'', \"When people say England, they sometimes mean Great Britain, sometimes the United Kingdom, sometimes the British Isles - but never England.\"</ref> and developed due to Holland becoming the dominant province and thus having the majority of political and economic interactions with other countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/story/is-holland-the-same-place-as-the-netherlands|title=Is \"Holland\" the Same Place as \"the Netherlands\"?|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nUnder [[Napoleon]] this usage was made official, the [[Puppet state|puppet kingdom]] ruled by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] being given the name \"[[Kingdom of Holland]]\"&nbsp;\u2013 but this was dropped after Napoleon's defeat and the restoration of the [[House of Orange]].\n\nThe people of Holland are referred to as \"Hollanders\" in both Dutch and English, though in English this now unusual and nearly-archaic. Today this refers specifically to people from the current provinces of North Holland and South Holland. Strictly speaking, the term \"Hollanders\" does not refer to people from the other provinces in the Netherlands, but colloquially \"Hollanders\" is sometimes used in this wider sense.\n\nIn Dutch, the Dutch word \"''Hollands''\" is the adjectival form for \"''Holland''\". The Dutch word \"''Hollands''\" is also colloquially and occasionally used by some Dutch people in the sense of \"''Nederlands''\" (Dutch), but then often with the intention of contrasting with other types of Dutch people or language, for example [[Limburgish]], the Belgian form of the Dutch language (\"[[Flemish]]\"), or even any southern variety of Dutch within the Netherlands itself.\n\nIn English, \"Dutch\" refers to the Netherlands as a whole, but there is no commonly used adjective for \"Holland\". The word \"Hollandish\" is no longer in common use. \"[[Hollandic]]\" is the name linguists give to the dialect spoken in Holland, and is occasionally also used by historians and when referring to pre-Napoleonic Holland.\n\n== History ==\nInitially, Holland was a remote corner of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Gradually, its regional importance increased until it began to have a decisive, and ultimately dominant, influence on the [[History of the Netherlands]].\n\n=== County of Holland ===\n{{Further information|County of Holland}}\n[[File:Wapen graafschap Holland.svg|150px|thumb|right|[[Coat of arms]] of the County of Holland]]\nUntil the start of the 12th century, the inhabitants of the area that became Holland were known as [[Frisians]]. The area was initially part of [[Frisia]]. At the end of the 9th century, West-Frisia became a separate [[county]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The first [[Count of Holland|Count]] known about with certainty was [[Dirk I, Count of Holland|Dirk I]], who ruled from 896 to 931. He was succeeded by a [[Counts of Holland family tree|long line of counts]] in the House of Holland (who were in fact known as counts of Frisia until 1101). When [[John I, Count of Holland|John I]], count of Holland, died childless in 1299, the county was inherited by [[John II, Count of Holland|John II of Avesnes]], [[county of Hainaut|count of Hainaut]]. By the time of [[William V, Count of Holland|William V]] ([[House of Wittelsbach]]; 1354\u20131388) the count of Holland was also the count of [[County of Hainaut|Hainaut]] and [[Zeeland|Zealand]].\n\nAfter the [[St. Lucia's flood]] in 1287 the part of [[Frisia]] west of the later [[Zuiderzee]], [[West Friesland (historical region)|West Friesland]], was conquered. As a result, most provincial institutions, including the [[States of Holland|States of Holland and West Frisia]], would for more than five centuries refer to \"Holland and West Frisia\" as a unit. The [[Hook and Cod wars]] started around this time and ended when the countess of Holland, Jacoba or [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut|Jacqueline]] was forced to give up Holland to the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian]] Philip III, known as [[Philip the Good]], in 1432.\n\nIn 1432, Holland became part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] and since 1477 of the [[Habsburg]] [[Seventeen Provinces]]. In the 16th century the county became the most densely [[urbanisation|urbanised]] region in Europe, with the majority of the population living in cities. Within the Burgundian Netherlands, Holland was the dominant province in the north; the political influence of Holland largely determined the extent of Burgundian dominion in that area. The last count of Holland was Philip III, better known as [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], king of Spain. He was deposed in 1581 by the [[Act of Abjuration]], although the kings of Spain continued to carry the titular appellation of Count of Holland until the [[Peace of M\u00fcnster]] signed in 1648.\n\n=== Dutch Republic ===\n[[File:COMITATUS HOLLANDIAE 1682.jpg|thumb|left|A map of Holland from 1682.]]\n\nIn the Dutch Rebellion against the Habsburgs during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the naval forces of the rebels, the [[Watergeuzen]], established their first permanent base in 1572 in the town of [[Brielle|Brill]]. In this way, Holland, now a sovereign state in a larger Dutch confederation, became the centre of the rebellion. It became the cultural, political and economic centre of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] ({{Lang-nl|Verenigde Provinci\u00ebn}}), in the 17th century, the [[Dutch Golden Age]], the wealthiest nation in the world. After the [[Act of Abjuration|King of Spain]] was deposed as the count of Holland, the executive and legislative power rested with the States of Holland, which was led by a political figure who held the office of [[Grand Pensionary]].\n\nThe largest cities in the [[Dutch Republic]] were in the province of Holland, such as [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]], [[Leiden]], [[Alkmaar]], [[The Hague]], [[Delft]], [[Dordrecht]] and [[Haarlem]]. From the great ports of Holland, Hollandic merchants sailed to and from destinations all over [[Europe]], and merchants from all over Europe gathered to trade in the warehouses of Amsterdam and other trading cities of Holland.\n\nMany Europeans thought of the United Provinces first as ''Holland'' rather than as the ''Republic of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands''. A strong impression of ''Holland'' was planted in the minds of other Europeans, which then was projected back onto the Republic as a whole. Within the provinces themselves, a gradual slow process of cultural expansion took place, leading to a \"Hollandification\" of the other provinces and a more uniform culture for the whole of the Republic. The dialect of urban Holland became the [[standard language]].\n\n=== Under French rule ===\n{{Further information|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\n[[File:Departments of French Empire North 1811-ex.svg|thumb|Departments of French Empire North 1811]]\n\nThe formation of the [[Batavian Republic]], inspired by the [[French revolution]], led to a more centralised government. Holland became a province of a [[unitary state]]. Its independence was further reduced by an administrative reform in 1798, in which its territory was divided into several departments called ''Amstel'', ''Delf'', ''Texel'', and part of ''Schelde en Maas''.\n\nFrom 1806 to 1810 [[Napoleon]] styled his vassal state, governed by his brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis Napoleon]] and shortly by the son of Louis, [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte]], as the \"[[Kingdom of Holland]]\". This kingdom encompassed much of what would become the modern Netherlands. The name reflects how natural at the time it had become to equate Holland with the non-Belgian Netherlands as a whole.<ref>Willem Frijhoff, \"Hollands hegemonie\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2002, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 2, p. 468</ref>\n\nDuring the period the Low Countries were annexed by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] and actually incorporated into France (from 1810 to 1813), Holland was divided into [[d\u00e9partement in France|d\u00e9partement]]s [[Zuyderz\u00e9e]], and [[Bouches-de-la-Meuse]]. From 1811 to 1813 [[Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun, duc de Plaisance]] served as [[governor-general]]. He was assisted by Antoine de Celles, [[Goswin de Stassart]] and Fran\u00e7ois Jean-Baptiste d'Alphonse.<ref>C.F. Gijsberti Hodenpijl (1904) Napoleon in Holland, p. 6-7.</ref>\n\n=== Kingdom of the Netherlands ===\nAfter 1813, Holland was restored as a province of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. Holland was divided into the present provinces [[North Holland]] and [[South Holland]] in 1840, after the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830. This reflected a historical division of Holland along the [[IJ (Amsterdam)|IJ]] into a Southern Quarter (''Zuiderkwartier'') and a Northern Quarter (''Noorderkwartier''),{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} but the actual division is different from the old division. From 1850, a strong process of [[nation building|nation formation]] took place, the Netherlands being culturally unified and economically integrated by a [[modernisation]] process, with the cities of Holland as its centre.<ref>Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, \"Brandpunt van macht en modernisering\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 548</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{Further information|Geography of the Netherlands}}\n[[File:Provincie Noord-Holland.gif|thumb|right|North Holland]]\n[[File:Provincie Zuid-Holland.gif|thumb|right|South Holland]]\n\nHolland is situated in the west of the Netherlands. A maritime region, Holland lies on the [[North Sea]] at the mouths of the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse]] ([[Meuse (river)|Maas]]). It has numerous rivers and lakes and an extensive inland canal and waterway system. To the south is [[Zeeland|Zealand]]. The region is bordered on the east by the [[IJsselmeer]] and four different provinces of the Netherlands.\n\nHolland is protected from the sea by a long line of coastal [[dunes]]. The highest point in Holland (about {{convert|55|m|ft}} above sea level<ref>{{cite web|title=Highpoints of the Netherlands|url=http://www.summitpost.org/highpoints-of-the-netherlands/462452|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920044727/http://www.summitpost.org/highpoints-of-the-netherlands/462452|archivedate=Sep 20, 2015}}</ref>) is in the {{Ill|Schoorlse Duinen|nl}} (Schoorl Dunes). Most of the land area behind the dunes consists of [[polder]] landscape lying well below [[sea level]].  At present the lowest point in Holland is a polder near [[Rotterdam]], which is about {{convert|7|m|ft|lk=out|spell=in}} below sea level. Continuous drainage is necessary to keep Holland from flooding. In earlier centuries [[windmill]]s were used for this task. The landscape was (and in places still is) dotted with windmills, which have become a symbol of Holland.\n\nHolland is {{convert|7,494|km2|lk=out|abbr=off}} (land and water included), making it roughly 13% of the area of the Netherlands. Looking at land alone, it is {{convert|5,488|km2|abbr=off}} in area. The combined population is 6.1&nbsp;million.\n\nThe main cities in Holland are Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. [[Amsterdam]] is formally the [[capital of the Netherlands]] and its largest city. The [[Port of Rotterdam]] is Europe's largest and most important harbour and port. [[The Hague]] is the [[seat of government]] of the Netherlands. These cities, combined with [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] and other smaller municipalities, effectively form a single [[metroplex]]\u2014a conurbation called [[Randstad]].\n\nThe Randstad area is one of the most densely populated regions of Europe, but still relatively free of urban sprawl. There are strict [[zoning laws]]. Population pressures are enormous, property values are high, and new housing is constantly under development on the edges of the built-up areas. Surprisingly, much of the province still has a rural character. The remaining agricultural land and natural areas are highly valued and protected. Most of the arable land is used for [[intensive agriculture]], including horticulture and [[greenhouse]] agri-businesses.\n\n=== Reclamation of the land ===\n[[File:Benthuizen dijk polder.jpg|thumb|left|Benthuizen polder, as seen from a dike]]\nThe land that is now Holland had never been stable. Over the millennia the geography of the region had been dynamic. The western coastline shifted up to {{convert|30|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} to the east and storm surges regularly broke through the row of coastal dunes. The [[Frisian Islands|Frisian Isles]], originally joined to the mainland, became detached islands in the north. The main rivers, the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River|Meuse (Maas)]], flooded regularly and changed course repeatedly and dramatically.\n\nThe people of Holland found themselves living in an unstable, watery environment. Behind the [[dunes]] on the coast of the Netherlands a high [[peat]] plateau had grown, forming a natural protection against the sea. Much of the area was [[marsh]] and [[bog]]. By the tenth century the inhabitants set about cultivating this land by draining it. However, the drainage resulted in extreme soil shrinkage, lowering the surface of the land by up to {{convert|15|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}}.\n\nTo the south of Holland, in [[Zeeland]], and to the north, in [[Frisia]], this development led to [[Floods in the Netherlands|catastrophic storm floods]] literally washing away entire regions, as the peat layer disintegrated or became detached and was carried away by the flood water. From the Frisian side the sea even flooded the area to the east, gradually hollowing Holland out from behind and forming the [[Zuiderzee]] (the present IJsselmeer). This inland sea threatened to link up with the \"drowned lands\" of Zealand in the south, reducing Holland to a series of narrow dune [[barrier island]]s in front of a [[lagoon]]. Only drastic administrative intervention saved the county from utter destruction. The counts and large monasteries took the lead in these efforts, building the first heavy emergency [[Dike (construction)|dikes]] to bolster critical points. Later special autonomous administrative bodies were formed, the ''[[waterschap]]pen'' (\"water control boards\"), which had the legal power to enforce their regulations and decisions on [[water management]]. As the centuries went by, they eventually constructed an extensive dike system that covered the coastline and the polders, thus protecting the land from further incursions by the sea.\n\nHowever, the Hollanders did not stop there. Starting around the 16th century, they took the offensive and began [[land reclamation]] projects, converting lakes, marshy areas and adjoining mudflats into [[polders]]. This continued right into the 20th century. As a result, historical maps of mediaeval and early modern Holland bear little resemblance to the maps of today.\n\nThis ongoing struggle to master the water played an important role in the development of Holland as a maritime and economic power and in the development of the character of the people of Holland.\n\n== Culture ==\nHolland tends to be associated with a particular image. The stereotypical image of Holland is an artificial amalgam of [[tulip]]s, [[windmill]]s, [[Clog (shoe)|clogs]], [[cheese]] and traditional dress (''klederdracht''). As is the case with many stereotypes, this is far from the truth and reality of life in Holland. This can at least in part be explained by the active exploitation of these stereotypes in promotions of Holland and the Netherlands. In fact only in a few of the more traditional villages, such as Volendam and locations in the [[Zaan]] area, are the different costumes with wooden shoes still worn by some inhabitants.\n\nThe predominance of Holland in the Netherlands has resulted in [[regionalism (politics)|regionalism]] on the part of the other provinces. This is a reaction to the perceived threat that Holland poses to the identities and local cultures of the other provinces. The other provinces have a strong, and often negative,<ref>Rob van Ginkel, \"Hollandse Tonelen\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 688</ref> image of Holland and the Hollanders, to whom certain qualities are ascribed within a [[mental geography]], a conceptual mapping of spaces and their inhabitants.<ref name = \"bwgsuh\">Hans Knippenberg and Ben de Pater, \"Brandpunt van macht en modernisering\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 556</ref> On the other hand, some Hollanders take Holland's cultural dominance for granted and treat the concepts of \"Holland\" and the \"Netherlands\" as coincidental. Consequently, they see themselves not primarily as \"Hollanders\", but simply as \"Dutch\" (''Nederlanders'').<ref>Thimo de Nijs, \"Hollandse identiteit in perspectief\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 700</ref> This phenomenon has been called \"hollandocentrism\".<ref>Rob van Ginkel, \"Hollandse Tonelen\" in Thimo de Nijs and Eelco Beukers (eds.), 2003, ''Geschiedenis van Holland'', Volume 3, p. 647</ref>\n\n=== Languages ===\n\nThe predominant language spoken in Holland is [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Hollanders sometimes refer to the Dutch language as \"''Hollands,''\"<ref>''Dutch: An Essential Grammar'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=p9d9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PT15&dq= p.15], William Z. Shetter, Esther Ham, Routlege, 2007</ref> instead of the standard term ''Nederlands''. Inhabitants of Belgium and other provinces of the Netherlands refer to \"Hollands\" to indicate someone speaking in a [[Hollandic]] dialect, or strong accent.\n\nStandard Dutch was historically largely based on the dialect of the [[County of Holland]], incorporating many traits derived from the dialects of the previously more powerful [[Duchy of Brabant]] and [[County of Flanders]]. Strong dialectal variation still exists throughout the [[Low Countries]]. Today, Holland-proper is the region where the original dialects are least spoken, in many areas having been completely replaced by standard Dutch, and the [[Randstad]] has the largest influence on the developments of the standard language\u2014with the exception of the Dutch spoken in Belgium.<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, pp. 127\u2013128</ref>\n\nDespite this correspondence between standard Dutch and the Dutch spoken in the Randstad, there are local variations within Holland itself that differ from standard Dutch. The main cities each have their own modern urban dialect, that can be considered a [[sociolect]].<ref>Sijs, Nicoline van der, 2006, ''De geschiedenis van het Nederlands in een notendop'', Amsterdam, Uitgeverij Bert Bakker, pp. 123</ref> A small number of people, especially in the area north of Amsterdam, still speak the original dialect of the county, Hollandic.  The Hollandic dialect is present in the north: [[Volendam]] and [[Marken]] and the area around there, [[West Friesland (region)|West Friesland]] and the [[Zaanstreek]]; and in a south-eastern fringe bordering on the provinces of [[North Brabant]] and [[Utrecht]]. In the south on the island of [[Goeree-Overflakkee]], [[Zealandic]] is spoken.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}\n=== New Holland ===\n{{see|New Holland (disambiguation){{!}}New Holland}}\nThe province of Holland gave its name to a number of colonial settlements and discovered regions that were called ''Nieuw Holland'' or [[New Holland (disambiguation)|New Holland]]. The most extensive of these was the island continent presently known as [[Australia]]: [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] was first applied to Australia in 1644 by the Dutch seafarer [[Dirk Hartog]] as a [[Latin]] ''Nova Hollandia'', and remained in international use for 190 years. Another Dutch explorer, [[Abel Tasman]] named [[New Zealand]] after the Dutch province of [[Zeeland|Zealand]]. In the Netherlands ''Nieuw Holland'' would remain the usual name of the continent until the end of the 19th century; it is now no longer in use there, the Dutch name today being ''Australi\u00eb''.\n\n=== As contemporary exonym for the Netherlands ===\n{{see|Terminology of the Low Countries#Holland as exonym}}\nWhile \"Holland\" has been replaced in English as the official name for the country of the Netherlands, other languages still use it or a variant of it to officially refer to the Netherlands.

Records begin with the four centuries during which the region formed a militarised border zone of the [[Romans in the Netherlands|Roman]] Empire. This came under increasing pressure from [[Germanic peoples]] moving westwards. As Roman power collapsed and the [[Middle Ages]] began, three dominant [[Germanic peoples]] coalesced in the area, [[Frisians]] in the north and coastal areas, [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxons]] in the northeast, and the [[Franks]] in the south.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the descendants of the [[Carolingian]] dynasty came to dominate the area and then extended their rule to a large part of Western Europe. The region of the [[Netherlands]] therefore became part of [[Lower Lotharingia]] within the Frankish [[Holy Roman Empire]]. For several centuries, lordships such as [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], [[County of Holland|Holland]], [[Zeeland]], [[Friesland]], [[Guelders]] and others held a changing patchwork of territories. There was no unified equivalent of the modern Netherlands.\n \nBy 1433, the [[Philip the Good|Duke of Burgundy]] had assumed control over most of the lowlands territories in Lower Lotharingia; he created the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] which included modern Belgium, Luxembourg, and a part of France.\n\nThe Catholic kings of Spain took strong measures against Protestantism, which polarised the peoples of present-day Belgium and the Netherlands. The subsequent [[Dutch revolt]] led to splitting the Burgundian Netherlands into a Catholic French and Dutch-speaking \"[[Spanish Netherlands]]\" (approximately corresponding to modern Belgium and Luxembourg), and a northern \"[[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]\", which spoke Dutch and were predominantly Protestant with a Catholic minority. It became the modern Netherlands.\n\nIn the [[Dutch Golden Age]], which had its zenith around 1667, there was a flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the [[List of people from the Dutch Golden Age#Science|sciences]]. A rich worldwide [[Dutch empire]] developed and the [[Dutch East India Company]] became one of the earliest and most important of national mercantile companies based on entrepreneurship and trade.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, the power, wealth and influence of the Netherlands declined. A series of wars with the more powerful [[Anglo-Dutch Wars|British]] and [[Franco-Dutch War|French]] neighbours weakened it. The UK seized the North American colony of [[New Amsterdam]], and renamed it \"New York\". There was growing unrest and [[Second Stadtholderless Period#Crisis and the Orangist revolution of 1747|conflict]] between the [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangists]] and the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]]. The French Revolution spilled over after 1789, and a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] was established in 1795\u20131806. Napoleon made it a satellite state, the [[Kingdom of Holland]] (1806\u20131810), and later simply a French imperial province.\n\nAfter the collapse of Napoleon in 1813\u201315, an expanded \"[[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]\" was created with the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]] as monarchs, also ruling Belgium and Luxembourg. The King imposed unpopular Protestant reforms on Belgium, [[Belgian Revolution|which revolted in 1830]] and became independent in 1839. After an initially conservative period, following the introduction of the 1848 constitution; the country became a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[constitutional monarch]]. Modern -day Luxembourg became officially independent from the Netherlands in 1839, but a personal union remained until 1890. Since 1890, it is ruled by another branch of the House of Nassau.\n\nThe Netherlands was neutral during the [[First World War]], but during the [[Second World War]], it was invaded and occupied by [[Nazi Germany]]. The Nazis, including many collaborators, rounded up and killed almost all of the country's Jewish population. When the Dutch resistance increased, the Nazis cut off food supplies to much of the country, causing severe starvation in 1944\u201345. In 1942, the Dutch East Indies were conquered by Japan, but prior to this; the Dutch destroyed the oil wells that Japan needed so badly. [[Indonesia]] proclaimed its independence from the Netherlands in 1945. [[Suriname]] gained independence in 1975. The post-war years saw rapid economic recovery (helped by the American [[Marshall Plan]]), followed by the introduction of a [[welfare state]] during an era of peace and prosperity. The Netherlands formed a new economic alliance with Belgium and Luxembourg, the [[Benelux]], and all three became founding members of the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]]. In recent decades, the Dutch economy has been closely linked to that of Germany, and is highly prosperous.

Agriculture was practised only on the [[loess]] [[plateau]] in the very south (southern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]), but even there it was not established permanently. Farms did not develop in the rest of the Netherlands.\n\nThere is also some evidence of small settlements in the rest of the country.

In this period of Dutch prehistory the first notable remains were erected: the [[dolmens]], large stone grave monuments. They are found in [[Drenthe]], and were probably built between 4100 BC and 3200 BC.\n\nTo the west, the [[Vlaardingen culture]] (around 2600 BC), an apparently more primitive culture of hunter-gatherers survived well into the [[Neolithic]] period.\n\n===Corded Ware and Bell Beaker cultures (around 3000\u20132000 BC)===\nAround 2950 BCE there was a transition from the [[Funnelbeaker]] farming culture to the [[Corded Ware]] pastoralist culture, a large archeological horizon appearing in western and central Europe, that is associated with the advance of Indo-European languages.

This culture also experimented with working with copper. Evidence of this, including stone anvils, copper knives, and a copper spearhead, was found on the [[Veluwe]]. Copper finds show that there was trade with other areas in Europe, as natural copper is not found in Dutch soil.\n\n===Bronze Age (around 2000\u2013800 BC)===\n[[File:Zwaard van Jutphaas.jpg|thumb|right|80px|A bronze ceremonial object (not a sword, but called the \"Sword of Jutphaas\"), dating from 1800\u20131500 BC and found south of [[Utrecht]].]]\n\nThe [[Bronze Age]] probably started somewhere around 2000 BC and lasted until around 800 BC. The earliest [[bronze]] tools have been found in the grave of a Bronze Age individual called \"the smith of [[Wageningen]]\". More Bronze Age objects from later periods have been found in [[Epe, Netherlands|Epe]], [[Drouwen]] and elsewhere. Broken bronze objects found in [[Voorschoten]] were apparently destined for recycling. This indicates how valuable bronze was considered in the Bronze Age. Typical bronze objects from this period included knives, swords, axes, [[fibulae]] and bracelets.\n\n[[File:BronzAgeElp.png|thumb|left|Location of the [[Elp culture|Elp]] and [[Hilversum culture]]s in the Bronze Age.]]\nMost of the Bronze Age objects found in the Netherlands have been found in [[Drenthe]]. One item shows that trading networks during this period extended a far distance. Large bronze ''situlae'' (buckets) found in Drenthe were manufactured somewhere in eastern France or in [[Switzerland]]. They were used for mixing wine with water (a Roman/Greek custom). The many finds in Drenthe of rare and valuable objects, such as tin-bead necklaces, suggest that Drenthe was a trading centre in the Netherlands in the Bronze Age.\n\nThe [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker cultures]] (2700\u20132100) locally developed into the Bronze Age Barbed-Wire Beaker culture (2100\u20131800). In the second millennium BC, the region was the boundary between the [[Atlantic Bronze Age|Atlantic]] and [[Nordic Bronze Age|Nordic]] horizons and was split into a northern and a southern region, roughly divided by the course of the [[Rhine]].\n\nIn the north, the [[Elp culture]] (c. 1800 to 800 BC)<ref>According to \"Het Archeologisch Basisregister\" (ABR), version 1.0 November 1992,  [http://www.racm.nl/content/documenten%5Cabr%20website.pdf], ''Elp K\u00fcmmerkeramik'' is dated BRONSMA (early MBA) to BRONSL (LBA) and this has been standardized by \"De Rijksdienst voor Archeologie, Cultuurlandschap en Monumenten\" (RACM)\" as being at the period starting at 1800 BC and ending at 800 BC.{{Failed verification|date=October 2011}} {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> was a Bronze Age archaeological culture having [[earthenware]] pottery of low quality known as \"''K\u00fcmmerkeramik''\" (or \"''Grobkeramik''\") as a marker. The initial phase was characterized by [[tumulus|tumuli]] (1800\u20131200 BC) that were strongly tied to contemporary tumuli in northern Germany and Scandinavia, and were apparently related to the [[Tumulus culture]] (1600\u20131200 BC) in central Europe. This phase was followed by a subsequent change featuring [[Urnfield]] ([[cremation]]) burial customs (1200\u2013800 BC). The southern region became dominated by the [[Hilversum culture]] (1800\u2013800), which apparently inherited the cultural ties with Britain of the previous Barbed-Wire Beaker culture.\n\n== The pre-Roman period (800 BC \u2013 58 BC) ==\n\n===Iron age===\n[[File:Boerderij IJzertijd Reijntjesveld.jpg|thumb|A reconstruction of an [[iron age]] dwelling on the Reijntjesveld near [[Orvelte]] in [[Drenthe]].]]\n[[File:Verbogen Keltische zwaard.jpg|thumb|The original curved iron sword from the [[Vorstengraf (Oss)]], [[Rijksmuseum van Oudheden]].]]\n\nThe [[Iron Age]] brought a measure of prosperity to the people living in the area of the present-day Netherlands. Iron ore was available throughout the country, including [[bog iron]] extracted from the [[ore]] in [[peat bogs]] (''moeras ijzererts'') in the north, the natural iron-bearing balls found in the [[Veluwe]] and the red iron ore near the rivers in Brabant. [[Blacksmith|Smiths]] travelled from small settlement to settlement with [[bronze]] and iron, fabricating tools on demand, including axes, knives, pins, arrowheads and swords. Some evidence even suggests the making of [[Damascus steel]] swords using an advanced method of [[forging]] that combined the flexibility of iron with the strength of steel.\n\nIn [[Oss]], a grave dating from around 500 BC was found in a burial mound 52 metres wide (and thus the largest of its kind in western Europe). Dubbed the \"king's grave\" (''[[Vorstengraf (Oss)]]''), it contained extraordinary objects, including an iron sword with an inlay of gold and coral.\n\nIn the centuries just before the arrival of the Romans, northern areas formerly occupied by the Elp culture emerged as the probably Germanic Harpstedt culture<ref name=Mallory>Mallory, J.P., ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans: Language, Archaeology and Myth'', London: Thames & Hudson, 1989, p. 87.</ref> while the southern parts were influenced by the [[Hallstatt culture]] and assimilated into the Celtic [[La T\u00e8ne culture]].

One of the most important is Caesar's own ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. Two main tribes he described as living in what is now the Netherlands were the [[Menapii]], and the [[Eburones]], both in the south, which is where Caesar was active. He established the principle that the Rhine defined a natural boundary between [[Gaul]] and [[Germania magna]]. But the Rhine was not a strong border, and he made it clear that there was a part of Belgic Gaul where many of the local tribes (including the Eburones) were \"[[Germani cisrhenani]]\", or in other cases, of mixed origin.\n\nThe Menapii stretched from the south of Zeeland, through [[North Brabant]] (and possibly [[South Holland]]), into the southeast of [[Gelderland]]. In later Roman times their territory seems to have been divided or reduced, so that it became mainly contained in what is now western Belgium.\n\nThe [[Eburones]], the largest of the ''Germani Cisrhenani'' group, covered a large area including at least part of modern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Dutch Limburg]], stretching east to the [[Rhine]] in Germany, and also northwest to the delta, giving them a border with the Menapii. Their territory may have stretched into Gelderland.\n\nIn the delta itself, Caesar makes a passing comment about the ''Insula Batavorum'' (\"Island of the Batavi\") in the [[Rhine river]], without discussing who lived there. Later, in imperial times, a tribe called the Batavi became very important in this region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0001:book=4:chapter=10&highlight=batavi|title=C.

(Tacitus reported that the Tungri was a new name for the earlier ''Germani cisrhenani''.)\n\nNorth of the Old Rhine, apart from the Frisii, Pliny reports some [[Chauci]] reached into the delta, and two other tribes known from the eastern Netherlands were the [[Tuihanti]] (or Tubantes) from [[Twenthe]] in Overijssel, and the [[Chamavi]], from [[Hamaland]] in northern Gelderland, who became one of the first tribes to be named as [[Franks|Frankish]] (see below). The [[Salians]], also Franks, probably originated in [[Salland]] in Overijssel, before they moved into the empire, forced by Saxons in the 4th century, first into Batavia, and then into Toxandria.\n\n===Roman settlements in the Netherlands===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| title = Roman settlements\n| image1 = Ruitermasker matilo.jpg|caption1=Mask of a Roman horseman, discovered near [[Leiden]].\n| image2 = Germania 70.svg|caption2=Rhine Frontier of the [[Roman Empire]] around 70 CE. \n}}\nStarting about 15 BC, the [[Rhine]], in the Netherlands came to be defended by the Lower [[Limes Germanicus]].

The area to the south would be integrated into the [[Roman Empire]]. At first part of [[Gallia Belgica]], this area became part of the [[Roman province|province]] of [[Germania Inferior]]. The tribes already within, or relocated to, this area became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The area to the north of the Rhine, inhabited by the [[Frisii]] and the [[Chauci]], remained outside Roman rule but not its presence and control.\n\nRomans built military forts along the [[Limes Germanicus]] and a number of towns and smaller settlements in the Netherlands. The more notable Roman towns were at [[Nijmegen]] ([[:nl:Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum|Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum]]) and at [[Voorburg]] ([[Forum Hadriani]]).\n\nPerhaps the most evocative Roman ruin is the mysterious [[Brittenburg]], which emerged from the sand at the beach in Katwijk several centuries ago, only to be buried again. These ruins were part of [[:nl:Lugdunum Batavorum|Lugdunum Batavorum]].\n\nOther Roman settlements, fortifications, temples and other structures have been found at [[Alphen aan de Rijn]] ([[Albaniana (Roman fort)|Albaniana]]); [[Bodegraven]]; [[Cuijk]]; [[Elst, Overbetuwe]]; [[Ermelo]]; [[Esch, Netherlands|Esch]]; [[Heerlen]]; [[Houten]]; [[Kessel, North Brabant]]; [[Oss]], i.e. De Lithse Ham near Maren-Kessel; Kesteren in [[Neder-Betuwe]]; [[Leiden]] ([[Matilo]]); [[Maastricht]]; Meinerswijk (now part of [[Arnhem]]); [[Tiel]]; [[Utrecht]] ([[Traiectum (Utrecht)|Traiectum]]); [[Valkenburg (South Holland)]] ([[Praetorium Agrippinae]]); Vechten ([[Fectio]]) now part of [[Bunnik]]; [[Velsen]]; [[Vleuten]]; [[Wijk bij Duurstede]] ([[:nl:Levefanum|Levefanum]]); [[Woerden]] ([[:nl:Laurium (Woerden)|Laurium]] or [[:nl:Laurium (Woerden)|Laurum]]); and [[Zwammerdam]] ([[:nl:Nigrum Pullum|Nigrum Pullum]]).\n\n===Batavian revolt===\n{{Main|Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Revolt of the Batavi}}\n[[File:\"Batavians defeating Romans on the Rhine\" by Otto van Veen.jpg|thumb|Throughout Dutch history, but especially during the [[Eighty Years' War]], the Batavians have been romantically portrayed as the heroic ancestors of the Dutch people. \"The Batavians Defeating the Romans on the Rhine\", c. 1613, by [[Otto van Veen]].]]\n[[File:Bataafseeed.jpg|thumb|''The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis'', 1661, by [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], depicts a [[Batavii|Batavian]] oath to [[Gaius Julius Civilis]], the head of the [[Batavian rebellion]] against the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] in 69 CE.]]\n\nThe [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavians]], Cananefates, and the other border tribes were held in high regard as soldiers throughout the empire, and traditionally served in the [[Ala (Roman military)|Roman cavalry]].<ref>Roymans, Nico, ''Ethnic Identity and Imperial Power: The Batavians in the Early Roman Empire'', Amsterdam: Amsterdam University Press, 2005, pp. 226\u201327</ref> The frontier culture was influenced by the Romans, [[Germanic people]], and Gauls. In the first centuries after Rome's conquest of Gaul, trade flourished. And Roman, Gaulish and Germanic material culture are found combined in the region.\n\nHowever, the Batavians rose against the Romans in the [[Batavian rebellion]] of 69 AD. The leader of this [[Revolt of the Batavi|revolt]] was Batavian [[Gaius Julius Civilis]]. One of the causes of the rebellion was that the Romans had taken young Batavians as [[Slavery|slaves]]. A number of Roman ''castella'' were attacked and burnt. Other Roman soldiers in [[Xanten]] and elsewhere and auxiliary troops of Batavians and [[Canninefates|Canninefatae]] in the legions of [[Vitellius]]) joined the revolt, thus splitting the northern part of the Roman army. In April 70 AD, a few legions sent by [[Vespasianus]] and commanded by [[Quintus Petillius Cerialis]] eventually defeated the Batavians and negotiated surrender with [[Gaius Julius Civilis]] somewhere between the [[Waal (river)|Waal]] and the [[Meuse River|Maas]] near Noviomagus ([[Nijmegen]]), which was probably called \"Batavodurum\" by the Batavians.<ref>[http://classics.mit.edu/Tacitus/histories.html ''Historiae''], Tacitus, 109 AD, Translated by Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb.</ref> The Batavians later merged with other tribes and became part of the [[Salian Franks]].\n\nDutch writers in the 17th and 18th centuries saw the rebellion of the independent and freedom-loving Batavians as mirroring the Dutch revolt against Spain and other forms of tyranny. According to this nationalist view, the [[Batavians]] were the \"true\" forefathers of the Dutch, which explains the recurring use of the name over the centuries. [[Jakarta]] was named \"Batavia\" by the Dutch in 1619. The Dutch republic created in 1795 on the basis of French revolutionary principles was called the [[Batavian Republic]].

By the end of the 6th century, the Frisian territory in the northern Netherlands had expanded west to the [[North Sea]] coast and, by the 7th century, south to [[Dorestad]].

A line of kings descended from Theuderic ruled [[Austrasia]] until 555, when it was united with the other Frankish kingdoms of [[Chlothar I]], who inherited all the Frankish realms by 558.

Some went further by ascribing certain attributes, values and strengths to these various groups and proposing that they reflected 19th-century nationalist and religious views. In particular, it was believed that this theory explained why Belgium and the southern Netherlands (i.e. the Franks) had become Catholic and the northern Netherlands (Frisians and Saxons) had become Protestant. The success of this theory was partly due to anthropological theories based on a tribal paradigm. Being politically and geographically inclusive, and yet accounting for diversity, this theory was in accordance with the need for nation-building and integration during the 1890\u20131914 period. The theory was taught in Dutch schools.\n\nHowever, the disadvantages of this historical interpretation became apparent. This tribal-based theory suggested that external borders were weak or non-existent and that there were clear-cut internal borders. This origins myth provided an historical premise, especially during the Second World War, for regional separatism and annexation to Germany. After 1945 the tribal paradigm lost its appeal for anthropological scholars and historians. When the accuracy of the three-tribe theme was fundamentally questioned, the theory fell out of favour.<ref name=\"Marnix Beyen 1850\"/>\n\nDue to the scarcity of written sources, knowledge of this period depends to a large degree on the interpretation of archaeological data. The traditional view of a clear-cut division between [[Frisians]] in the north and coast, [[Franks]] in the south and [[Saxons]] in the east has proven historically problematic.<ref>Blok, D.P.

(2003), pp. 30\u201333</ref>\n\n===The emergence of the Dutch language===\n{{Main|Old Dutch|Old Frisian|Dutch Low Saxon}}\nThe language from which [[Old Dutch]] (also sometimes called [[Old West Low Franconian]], [[Old Low Franconian]] or [[Old Frankish]]) arose is not known with certainty, but it is thought to be the language spoken by the [[Salian Franks]]. Even though the Franks are traditionally categorized as [[Weser-Rhine Germanic]], Dutch has a number of [[Ingvaeonic]] characteristics and is classified by modern linguists as an [[Ingvaeonic]] language. Dutch also has a number of [[Old Saxon]] characteristics. There was a close relationship between [[Old Dutch]], [[Old Saxon]], [[Old English]] and [[Old Frisian]]. Because texts written in the language spoken by the Franks are almost non-existent, and [[Old Dutch]] texts scarce and fragmentary, not much is known about the development of [[Old Dutch]]. [[Old Dutch]] made the transition to [[Middle Dutch]] around 1150.<ref name=\"Verhaal\"/>\n\n===Christianization===\nThe Christianity that arrived in the Netherlands with the Romans appears not to have died out completely (in [[Maastricht]], at least) after the withdrawal of the Romans in about 411.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/>\n\nThe [[Franks]] became Christians after their king [[Clovis I]] converted to Catholicism, an event which is traditionally set in 496. Christianity was introduced in the north after the conquest of [[Friesland]] by the [[Franks]]. The [[Saxons]] in the east were converted before the conquest of [[Saxony]], and became Frankish allies.\n\n[[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Hiberno-Scottish]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missionaries, particularly [[Willibrord]], [[Wulfram of Sens|Wulfram]] and [[Boniface]], played an important role in converting the Frankish and Frisian peoples to Christianity by the 8th century. Boniface was martyred by the [[Frisians]] in [[Dokkum]] (754).\n\n===Frankish dominance and incorporation into the Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Frisian-Frankish Wars}}\n[[File:Radboud doopvont.jpg|thumb|left|An early 16th-century tapestry depicting the near baptism of [[Redbad, King of the Frisians]], who died in 719 CE.]]\n\nIn the early 8th century the Frisians came increasingly into conflict with the [[Franks]] to the south, resulting in a [[Frisian\u2013Frankish wars|series of wars]] in which the [[Frankish Empire]] eventually subjugated Frisia. In 734, at the [[Battle of the Boarn]], the Frisians in the Netherlands were defeated by the [[Franks]], who thereby conquered the area west of the [[Lauwers]]. The Franks then conquered the area east of the Lauwers in 785 when [[Charlemagne]] defeated [[Widukind]].\n\nThe linguistic descendants of the Franks, the modern [[Dutch people|Dutch]][[Dutch language|-speakers]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Flanders]], seem to have broken with the [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] \"Frank\" around the 9th century. By this time Frankish identity had changed from an ethnic identity to a national identity, becoming localized and confined to the modern ''[[Franconia]]'' and principally to the French province of ''[[\u00cele-de-France]]''.<ref>van der Wal, M., ''Geschiedenis van het Nederlands'', 1992 {{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the people no longer referred to themselves as \"Franks\", the Netherlands was still part of the [[Frankish empire]] of [[Charlemagne]]. Indeed, because of the Austrasian origins of the Carolingians in the area between the Rhine and the Maas, the cities of Aachen, Maastricht, Li\u00e8ge and Nijmegen were at the heart of Carolingian culture.<ref name=\"Milis, L.J.R. pp. 6-18\"/> Charlemagne maintained his ''palatium''<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlemagne: Court and administration|work= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106546/Charlemagne/256621/Court-and-administration}} (\"Charlemagne relied on his palatium, a shifting assemblage of family members, trusted lay and ecclesiastical companions, and assorted hangers-on, which constituted an itinerant court following the king as he carried out his military campaigns and sought to take advantage of the income from widely scattered royal estates.\")</ref> in [[Nijmegen]] at least four times.\n\nThe [[Carolingian empire]] would eventually include France, Germany, northern [[Italy]] and much of Western Europe. In 843, the Frankish empire was divided into three parts, giving rise to [[West Francia]] in the west, [[East Francia]] in the east, and [[Middle Francia]] in the centre. Most of what is today the Netherlands became part of [[Middle Francia]]; Flanders became part of [[West Francia]]. This division was an important factor in the historical distinction between Flanders and the other Dutch-speaking areas.\n\n[[Middle Francia]] ({{lang-la|Francia media}}) was an ephemeral [[Francia|Frankish]] kingdom that had no historical or ethnic identity to bind its varied peoples. It was created by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843, which divided the [[Carolingian Empire]] among the sons of [[Louis the Pious]]. Situated between the realms of [[East Francia|East]] and [[West Francia]], Middle Francia comprised the Frankish territory between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], the [[Frisia]]n coast of the [[North Sea]], the former [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] (except for a western portion, later known as [[Duchy of Burgundy|''Bourgogne'']]), [[Provence]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]].\n\nMiddle Francia fell to [[Lothair I]], the eldest son and successor of [[Louis the Pious]], after an intermittent civil war with his younger brothers [[Louis the German]] and [[Charles the Bald]]. In acknowledgement of Lothair's [[Holy Roman Emperor|Imperial]] title, Middle Francia contained the imperial cities of [[Aachen]], the residence of [[Charlemagne]], as well as Rome. In 855, on his deathbed at [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]], Emperor Lothair I again partitioned his realm amongst his sons. Most of the lands north of the [[Alps]], including the Netherlands, passed to [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothair II]] and consecutively were named [[Lotharingia]]. After Lothair II died in 869, Lotharingia was partitioned by his uncles Louis the German and Charles the Bald in the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] in 870. Although some of the Netherlands had come under Viking control, in 870 it technically became part of [[East Francia]], which became the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 962.\n\n===Viking raids===\n[[File:Rorik by H. W. Koekkoek.jpg|thumb|[[Rorik of Dorestad]], [[Viking]] conqueror and ruler of [[Friesland]], a romantic 1912 depiction by [[Johannes Hermanus Koekkoek|Johannes H. Koekkoek]].]]\nIn the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings raided the largely defenceless [[Frisians|Frisian]] and [[Franks|Frankish]] towns lying on the coast and along the rivers of the [[Low Countries]]. Although Vikings never settled in large numbers in those areas, they did set up long-term bases and were even acknowledged as lords in a few cases. In Dutch and Frisian historical tradition, the trading centre of [[Dorestad]] declined after Viking raids from 834 to 863; however, since no convincing Viking archaeological evidence has been found at the site (as of 2007), doubts about this have grown in recent years.<ref>More info about Viking raids can be found online at L. van der Tuuk, [http://home.tiscali.nl/gjallar/index.html Gjallar. Noormannen in de Lage Landen]</ref>\n\nOne of the most important Viking families in the Low Countries was that of [[Rorik of Dorestad]] (based in [[Wieringen]]) and his brother the \"younger Harald\" (based in [[Walcheren]]), both thought to be nephews of [[Harald Klak]].<ref>Baldwin, Stephen, [http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/GEN-MEDIEVAL/2002-09/1031544685 \"Danish Haralds in 9th Century Frisia\"]. Retrieved 9 October 2011.</ref> Around 850, [[Lothair I]] acknowledged Rorik as ruler of most of Friesland. And again in 870, Rorik was received by [[Charles the Bald]] in [[Nijmegen]], to whom he became a vassal. Viking raids continued during that period. Harald's son Rodulf and his men were killed by the people of [[Oostergo]] in 873. Rorik died sometime before 882.\n\nBuried Viking treasures consisting mainly of silver have been found in the Low Countries. Two such treasures have been found in Wieringen. A large treasure found in Wieringen in 1996 dates from around 850 and is thought perhaps to have been connected to Rorik. The burial of such a valuable treasure is seen as an indication that there was a permanent settlement in Wieringen.<ref>\"[http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html Vikingschat van Wieringen\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718064223/http://www.museumkennis.nl/lp.rmo/museumkennis/i000412.html |date=18 July 2011 }}, Museumkennis.nl.

Using [[Ghent]] as his base, they ravaged Ghent, [[Maastricht]], [[Li\u00e8ge]], [[Stavelot]], [[Pr\u00fcm]], [[Cologne]], and [[Koblenz]]. Controlling most of Frisia between 882 and his death in 885, Godfrid became known to history as [[Godfrid, Duke of Frisia]]. His lordship over Frisia was acknowledged by [[Charles the Fat]], to whom he became a vassal. Godfried was assassinated in 885, after which [[Gerolf of Holland]] assumed lordship and Viking rule of Frisia came to an end.\n\nViking raids of the Low Countries continued for over a century. Remains of Viking attacks dating from 880 to 890 have been found in [[Zutphen]] and [[Deventer]]. In 920, King [[Henry I of Germany|Henry]] of Germany liberated [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. According to a number of chronicles, the last attacks took place in the first decade of the 11th century and were directed at [[Tiel]] and/or [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].<ref>Jesch, Judith, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=RkNY2KrdvscC&pg=PA82 Ships and Men in the Late Viking Age: The Vocabulary of Runic Inscriptions and Skaldic Verse]'', Boydell & Brewer, 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-85115-826-6}}. p. 82.</ref>\n\nThese Viking raids occurred about the same time that French and German lords were fighting for supremacy over the middle empire that included the Netherlands, so their sway over this area was weak. Resistance to the Vikings, if any, came from local nobles, who gained in stature as a result.\n\n==High & Late Middle Ages (1000\u20131432)==\n\n===Part of the Holy Roman Empire===\nThe German kings and emperors ruled the Netherlands in the 10th and 11th century. Germany was called the Holy Roman Empire after the coronation of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|King Otto the Great]] as emperor. The Dutch city of [[Nijmegen]] used to be the spot of an important domain of the German emperors. Several German emperors were born and died there, including for example [[Byzantine]] empress [[Theophanu]], who died in Nijmegen. Utrecht was also an important city and trading port at the time.\n\n===Political disunity===\n[[File:Valkhofkapel.JPG|thumb|Chapel of St Nicholas ({{Interlanguage link multi|Sint-Nicolaaskapel|nl}} or Valkhofkapel) in [[Nijmegen]], one of the oldest buildings in the Netherlands.]]\n\nThe Holy Roman Empire was not able to maintain political unity. In addition to the growing independence of the towns, local rulers turned their counties and duchies into private kingdoms and felt little sense of obligation to the emperor who reigned over large parts of the nation in name only. Large parts of what now comprise the Netherlands were governed by the Count of Holland, the Duke of [[Gelre]], the Duke of Brabant and the Bishop of Utrecht. [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] in the north maintained their independence and were governed by the lower nobility.\n\nThe various feudal states were in a state of almost continual war. [[Gelre]] and Holland fought for control of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]]. Utrecht, whose bishop had in 1000 ruled over half of what is today the Netherlands, was marginalised as it experienced continuing difficulty in electing new bishops. At the same time, the dynasties of neighbouring states were more stable. [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]] and most of Gelre, which used to be part of Utrecht, became independent. Brabant tried to conquer its neighbours, but was not successful.  Holland also tried to assert itself in Zeeland and Friesland, but its attempts failed.\n\n===The Frisians===\nThe language and culture of most of the people who lived in the area that is now Holland were originally [[Frisia]]n. The sparsely populated area was known as \"West Friesland\" (''Westfriesland''). As Frankish settlement progressed, the Frisians migrated away or were absorbed and the area quickly became [[Old Dutch|Dutch]].  (The part of North Holland situated north of [[Alkmaar]] is still colloquially known as West Friesland).\n\nThe rest of [[Friesland]] in the north continued to maintain its independence during this time. It had its own institutions (collectively called the \"[[Frisian freedom]]\") and resented the imposition of the feudal system and the patriciate found in other European towns. They regarded themselves as allies of Switzerland. The Frisian battle cry was \"better dead than a slave\". They later lost their independence when they were defeated in 1498 by the German [[Landsknecht]] mercenaries of [[Albert, Duke of Saxony|Duke Albrecht of Saxony-Meissen]].\n\n===The rise of Holland===\n[[File:Rochussen Egmond.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dirk VI, Count of Holland]], 1114\u20131157, and his mother Petronella visiting the work on the [[Egmond Abbey]], Charles Rochussen, 1881.

Originally granted as a fief to the Danish chieftain [[Rorik of Dorestad|Rorik]] in return for loyalty to the emperor in 862, the region of [[Kennemerland|Kennemara]] (the region around modern [[Haarlem]]) rapidly grew under Rorik's descendants in size and importance. By the early 11th century, [[Dirk III, Count of Holland]] was levying tolls on the Meuse estuary and was able to resist military intervention from his overlord, the Duke of Lower Lorraine.\n\nIn 1083, the name \"Holland\" first appears in a deed referring to a region corresponding more or less to the current province of South Holland and the southern half of what is now North Holland. Holland's influence continued to grow over the next two centuries. The [[counts of Holland]] conquered most of [[Zeeland]] but it was not until 1289 that Count [[Floris V]] was able to subjugate the Frisians in West Friesland (that is, the northern half of North Holland).\n\n===Expansion and growth===\n{{Main|History of urban centers in the Dutch Low Countries}}\n\nAround 1000 AD there were several agricultural developments (described sometimes as an agricultural revolution) that resulted in an increase in production, especially food production. The economy started to develop at a fast pace, and the higher productivity allowed workers to farm more land or to become tradesmen.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nMuch of the western Netherlands was barely inhabited between the end of the Roman period until around 1100 AD, when farmers from [[Flanders]] and [[Utrecht]] began purchasing the swampy land, draining it and cultivating it. This process happened quickly and the uninhabited territory was settled in a few generations. They built independent farms that were not part of villages, something unique in Europe at the time.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n[[Guilds]] were established and markets developed as production exceeded local needs. Also, the introduction of currency made trading a much easier affair than it had been before. Existing towns grew and new towns sprang into existence around [[monasteries]] and [[castles]], and a mercantile middle class began to develop in these urban areas. Commerce and town development increased as the population grew.\n\nThe [[Crusade]]s were popular in the Low Countries and drew many to fight in the [[Holy Land]]. At home, there was relative peace. Viking pillaging had stopped. Both the Crusades and the relative peace at home contributed to trade and the growth in commerce.\n\nCities arose and flourished, especially in [[Flanders]] and [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]]. As the cities grew in wealth and power, they started to buy certain privileges for themselves from the [[monarch|sovereign]], including [[City rights in the Low Countries|city rights]], the right to self-government and the right to pass laws. In practice, this meant that the wealthiest cities became quasi-independent republics in their own right. Two of the most important cities were [[Brugge]] and [[Antwerp]] (in [[Flanders]]) which would later develop into some of the most important cities and ports in Europe.\n\n===Hook and Cod Wars===\n{{Main|Hook and Cod wars}}\n[[File:Jacoba van Beieren (1401-1436), gravin van Holland en Zeeland.jpg|thumb|[[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]], 1401\u20131436, known to the Dutch as \"Jacoba of Bavaria\".]]\nThe [[Hook and Cod Wars]] ({{lang-nl|Hoekse en Kabeljauwse twisten}}) were a series of wars and battles in the [[County of Holland]] between 1350 and 1490. Most of these wars were fought over the title of [[count of Holland]], but some have argued that the underlying reason was because of the power struggle of the [[bourgeois]] in the cities against the ruling nobility.\n\nThe Cod faction generally consisted of the more progressive cities of [[Holland]].  The Hook faction consisted for a large part of the conservative noblemen. Some of the main figures in this multi-generational conflict were [[William IV, Count of Holland|William IV]], [[Margaret II, Countess of Hainaut|Margaret]], [[William V, Count of Hainaut|William V]], [[William VI, Count of Holland|William VI, Count of Holland and Hainaut]], [[John, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing|John]] and [[Philip III, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]]. But perhaps the most well known is [[Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut]].\n\nThe conquest of the county of Holland by the Duke [[Philip the Good]] of Burgundy was an odd affair. Leading noblemen in Holland invited the duke to conquer Holland, even though he had no historical claim to it. Some historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} say that the ruling class in Holland wanted Holland to integrate with the [[Flanders|Flemish]] economic system and adopt Flemish legal institutions. Europe had been wracked by many civil wars in the 14th and 15th centuries, while Flanders had grown rich and enjoyed peace.\n\n== Burgundian and Habsburg period (1433\u20131567) ==\n[[File:Political map of the Low Countries (1350)-NL.svg|thumb|left|The Low Countries in the late 14th century CE.]]\n\n===Burgundian period===\n{{Main|Burgundian Netherlands}}\nMost of what is now the Netherlands and Belgium was eventually united by the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] in 1433. Before the Burgundian union, the Dutch identified themselves by the town they lived in, their local duchy or county or as subjects of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The Burgundian period is when the Dutch began the road to nationhood.\n\nHolland's trade developed rapidly, especially in the areas of shipping and transport. The new rulers defended Dutch trading interests. The fleets of Holland defeated the fleets of the [[Hanseatic League]] several times. Amsterdam grew and in the 15th century became the primary trading port in Europe for grain from the Baltic region. Amsterdam distributed grain to the major cities of Belgium, Northern France and England. This trade was vital to the people of Holland, because Holland could no longer produce enough grain to feed itself. Land drainage had caused the peat of the former [[wetland]]s to reduce to a level that was too low for drainage to be maintained.\n\n===Habsburg rule from Spain===\n{{Main|Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor}}\n[[File:Hadrian VI.jpg|thumb|Influential [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] theologian Adriaan Florenszoon Boeyens, 1459\u20131523, was an advisor to Charles; in the last year of his life he became pope as [[Pope Adrian VI]] (1522\u201323).]]\n[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] (1500\u201358) was born and raised in the [[County of Flanders|Flemish]] city of [[Ghent]]; he spoke French.  Charles extended the Burgundian territory with the annexation of [[Tournai]], Artois, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Guelders]]. The [[Seventeen Provinces]] had been unified by Charles's Burgundian ancestors, but nominally were [[fief]]s of either France or the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. When he was a minor, his aunt [[Margaret of Austria (1480-1530)|Margaret]] acted as regent until 1515. France relinquished its ancient claim on [[Flanders]] in 1528.<ref>{{cite book|author=James D.

J. - Erasmus - Louvre.jpg|left|thumb|[[Desiderius Erasmus]], 1466\u20131536, [[Rotterdam]] Renaissance humanist, Catholic priest and theologian, by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], 1523.]]\nFrom 1515 to 1523, Charles's government in the Netherlands had to contend with the rebellion of [[Arumer Zwarte Hoop|Frisian peasants]] (led by [[Pier Gerlofs Donia]] and [[Wijard Jelckama]]). [[Gelre]] attempted to build up its own state in northeast Netherlands and northwest Germany. Lacking funds in the 16th century, Gelre had its soldiers provide for themselves by pillaging enemy terrain. These soldiers were a great menace to the Burgundian Netherlands, as when they pillaged [[The Hague]].\n\nThe dukes of Burgundy over the years through astute marriages, purchases and wars, had taken control of the [[Seventeen Provinces]]  that made up the Low Countries. They are now the Netherlands in the north, the [[Southern Netherlands]] (now Belgium) in the south, and Luxemburg in the southeast. Known as the \"Burgundian Circle,\" these lands came under the control of the Habsburg family. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] (1500\u201358) became the owner in 1506, but in 1515 he left to become king of Spain and later became the Holy Roman Emperor. Charles turned over control to regents (his close relatives), and in practice rule was exercised by Spaniards he controlled. The provinces each had their own governments and courts, controlled by the local nobility, and their own traditions and rights (\"liberties\") dating back centuries. Likewise the numerous cities had their own legal rights and local governments, usually controlled by the merchants, On top of this the Spanish had imposed an overall government, the Estates General of the Netherlands, with its own officials and courts.<ref>H.G. Koenigsberger, \"The Beginnings of the States General of the Netherlands,\" ''Parliaments, Estates and Representation'' (1988) 8#2 pp 101\u201314.</ref>  The Spanish officials sent by Charles ignored traditions and the Dutch nobility as well as local officials, inciting an anti-Spanish sense of nationalism, and leading to the [[Dutch Revolt]]. With the emergence of the Protestant Reformation, Charles\u2014now the Emperor\u2014was determined to crush Protestantism and never compromise with it. Unrest began in the south, centered in the large rich metropolis of Antwerp. The Netherlands was an especially rich unit of the Spanish realm, especially after the [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis]] of 1559; it ended four decades of warfare between France and Spain and allowed Spain to reposition its army.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\">Albert Guerard, ''France, A Modern History'', (1959), pp. 134\u201336.</ref>\n\nIn 1548, Charles granted the Netherlands status as an entity in which many of the laws of the Holy Roman Empire became obsolete.

Po-chia Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006)  pp. 118\u201334</ref>  Dutch [[Protestants]], after initial repression, were tolerated by local authorities.

Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 104</ref> In a society dependent on trade, freedom and tolerance were considered essential. Nevertheless, the Catholic rulers Charles V, and later [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], made it their mission to defeat Protestantism, which was considered a heresy by the Catholic Church and a threat to the stability of the whole hierarchical political system. On the other hand, the intensely moralistic Dutch Protestants insisted their Biblical theology, sincere piety and humble lifestyle was morally superior to the luxurious habits and superficial religiosity of the ecclesiastical nobility.<ref>Hsia, ed. ''A Companion to the Reformation World'' (2006)  pp. 3\u201336</ref>  The rulers' harsh punitive measures led to increasing grievances in the Netherlands, where the local governments had embarked on a course of peaceful coexistence. In the second half of the century, the situation escalated. Philip sent troops to crush the rebellion and make the Netherlands once more a Catholic region.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (1995) p. 155</ref>\n\nIn the first wave of the Reformation, [[Lutheranism]] won over the elites in Antwerp and the South.  The Spanish successfully suppressed it there, and Lutheranism only flourished in east Friesland.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 374\u201375</ref>\n\nThe second wave of the Reformation, came in the form of [[Anabaptism]], that was popular among ordinary farmers in [[Holland]] and [[Friesland]]. Anabaptists were socially very radical and equalitarian; they believed that the apocalypse was very near. They refused to live the old way, and began new communities, creating considerable chaos. A prominent Dutch Anabaptist was [[Menno Simons]], who initiated the [[Mennonite|Mennonite church]]. The movement was allowed in the north, but never grew to a large scale.<ref>Israel, ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall, 1477\u20131806'' (1995) pp. 86\u201391</ref>\n\nThe third wave of the Reformation, that ultimately proved to be permanent, was [[Calvinism]]. It arrived in the Netherlands in the 1540s, attracting both the elite and the common population, especially in [[Flanders]]. The Catholic Spanish responded with harsh persecution and introduced the [[Inquisition of the Netherlands]]. Calvinists rebelled. First there was the [[Beeldenstorm|iconoclasm]] in 1566, which was the systematic destruction of statues of saints and other Catholic devotional depictions in churches. In 1566, [[William the Silent]], a Calvinist, started the [[Eighty Years' War]] to liberate all Dutch of whatever religion from Catholic Spain. Blum says, \"His patience, tolerance, determination, concern for his people, and belief in government by consent held the Dutch together and kept alive their spirit of revolt.\"<ref>Jerome Blum et al, ''The European World: A History'' (1970) pp 160-61</ref>  The provinces of [[Holland]] and [[Zeeland]], being mainly Calvinist by 1572, submitted to the rule of William.

This treaty ended a forty-year period of warfare between France and Spain conducted in Italy from 1521 to 1559.<ref name=\"Albert Guerard 1959 pp. 134\"/>  The Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis was somewhat of a watershed\u2014not only for the battleground that Italy had been, but also for northern Europe. Spain had been keeping troops in the Netherlands to be ready to attack France from the north as well as from the south.\n\nWith the settlement of so many major issues between France and Spain by the Treaty of Cateau-Cambresis, there was no longer any reason to keep Spanish troops in the Netherlands.  Thus, the people of the Netherlands could get on with their peacetime pursuits.  As they did so they found that there was a great deal of demand for their products.  Fishing had long been an important part of the economy of the Netherlands.  However, now the fishing of herring alone came to occupy 2,000 boats operating out of Dutch ports. Spain, still the Dutch trader's best customer, was buying fifty large ships full of furniture and household utensils from Flanders merchants. Additionally, Dutch woolen goods were desired everywhere.  The Netherlands bought and processed enough Spanish wool to sell four million florins of wool products through merchants in Bruges. So strong was the Dutch appetite for raw wool at this time that they bought nearly as much English wool as they did Spanish wool.  Total commerce with England alone amounted to 24 million florins.  Much of the export going to England resulted in pure profit to the Dutch because the exported items were of their own manufacture. The Netherlands was just starting to enter its \"Golden Age.\" Brabant and Flanders were the richest and most flourishing parts of the Dutch Republic at the time.<ref name=\"Claflin\">Claflin, W. Harold, ed. ''History of Nations: Holland and Belgium'', (New York: P.F. Collier & Son, 1907), pp. 72\u201374, 103\u201305</ref> The Netherlands was one of the richest places in the world. The population reached 3 million in 1560, with 25 cities of 10,000 people or more, by far the largest urban presence in Europe; with the trading and financial center of Antwerp being especially important (population 100,000). Spain could not afford to lose this rich land, nor allow it to fall from Catholic control. Thus came 80 years of warfare.\n\nA devout Catholic, Philip was appalled by the success of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the [[Low Countries]], which had led to an increasing number of [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. His attempts to enforce religious persecution of the Protestants, and his centralization of government, law enforcement, and taxes, made him unpopular and led to a [[revolt]]. [[Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba]], was sent with a Spanish Army to punish the unruly Dutch in 1567.<ref name=\"Motley\">John Lathrop Motley, ''The Rise of the Dutch Republic'' (Harper & Bros.: New York, 1855) pp. 106\u201315, 121, 122, 207, 213</ref>\n\nThe only opposition the Duke of Alba faced in his march across the Netherlands were the nobles, [[Lamoral, Count of Egmont]]; [[Philippe de Montmorency, Count of Horn]] and others. With the approach of Alba and the Spanish army, [[William the Silent]] of Orange fled to Germany with his three brothers and his whole family on 11 April 1567. The Duke of Alba sought to meet and negotiate with the nobles that now faced him with armies.  However, when the nobles arrived in Brussels they were all arrested and Egmont and Horn were executed.<ref name=\"Motley\"/> Alba then revoked all the prior treaties that Margaret, the [[Duchess of Parma]] had signed with the Protestants of the Netherlands and instituted the Inquisition to enforce the decrees of the [[Council of Trent]].\n\n==The Eighty Years' War (1568\u20131648)==\n{{Main|Eighty Years' War|Dutch Revolt}}\n[[File:Slag bij Nieuwpoort.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange|Prince Maurits]] at the [[Battle of Nieuwpoort]], 1600 CE, by Paulus van Hillegaert.]]\n[[File:Leo belgicus.png|thumb|[[Leo Belgicus]], a map of the [[low countries]] drawn in the shape of a lion, by [[Claes Jansz.

''The Thirty Years' War'', New York: Routledge Press, 1987, p. 2.</ref>  The seven rebellious provinces of the Netherlands were eventually united by the [[Union of Utrecht]] in 1579 and formed the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] (also known as the \"United Provinces\"). The [[Act of Abjuration]] or ''Plakkaat van Verlatinghe'' was signed on 26 July 1581, and was the formal [[declaration of independence]] of the northern [[Low Countries]] from the Spanish king.\n\n[[William the Silent|William of Orange]] (Slot Dillenburg, 24 April 1533 \u2013 Delft, 10 July 1584), the founder of the Dutch royal family, led the Dutch during the first part of the war, following the death of Egmont and Horn in 1568. The very first years were a success for the Spanish troops. However, the Dutch countered subsequent sieges in [[Holland]]. In November and December 1572, all the citizens of [[Zutphen]] and [[Naarden]] were slaughtered by the Spanish. From 11 December that year the city of [[Haarlem]] was besieged, holding out for seven months until 13 July 1573. [[Oudewater]] was conquered by the Spanish on 7 August 1575, and most of its inhabitants were killed. [[Maastricht]] was besieged, sacked and destroyed twice in succession (in 1576 and 1579) by the Spanish.\n\nIn a war composed mostly of sieges rather than battles, [[Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma|Governor-General Alexander Farnese]] proved his mettle. His strategy was to offer generous terms for the surrender of a city: there would be no more massacres or looting; historic urban privileges were retained; there was a full pardon and amnesty; return to the Catholic Church would be gradual. The conservative Catholics in the south and east supported the Spanish. Farnese recaptured [[Antwerp]] and nearly all of what became Belgium.<ref>Violet Soen, \"Reconquista and Reconciliation in the Dutch Revolt: The Campaign of Governor-General Alexander Farnese (1578-1592),\" ''[[Journal of Early Modern History]]'' (2012) 16#1 pp. 1\u201322.</ref> Most of the Dutch-speaking territory in the Netherlands was taken from Spain, but not in [[Flanders]], which to this day remains part of Belgium. Flanders was the most radical anti-Spanish territory. Many Flemish fled to Holland, among them half of the population of Antwerp, 3/4 of Bruges and Ghent and the entire population of Nieuwpoort, Dunkerque and countryside.<ref>Bart de Groof, \"Alexander Farnese and the Origins of Modern Belgium,\" ''Bulletin de l'Institut Historique Belge de Rome'' (1993) Vol. 63, pp. 195\u2013219.</ref>  His successful campaign gave the Catholics control of the lower half of the Low Countries, and was part of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]].\n\nThe war dragged on for another half century, but the main fighting was over. The [[Peace of Westphalia]], signed in 1648, confirmed the independence of the United Provinces from Spain. The Dutch people started to develop a national identity since the 15th century, but they officially remained a part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until 1648. National identity was mainly formed by the province people came from. Holland was the most important province by far. The republic of the Seven Provinces came to be known as '''Holland''' across Europe.\n\nThe Catholics in the Netherlands were an outlawed minority that had been suppressed by the Calvinists. After 1572, however, they made a striking comeback (also as part of the Catholic Counter-Reformation), setting up seminaries, reforming their Church, and sending missionaries into Protestant districts. Laity often took the lead; the Calvinist government often arrested or harassed priests who seemed too effective. Catholic numbers stabilized at about a third of the population in the Netherlands; they were strongest in the southeast.<ref>see [http://www.quirksmode.org/politics/kuyper.html religion map]</ref><ref>Charles H.

During the Golden Age, there was a great flowering of trade, industry, the arts and the sciences in the Netherlands. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch were arguably the most economically wealthy and scientifically advanced of all European nations. This new, officially Calvinist nation flourished culturally and economically, creating what historian [[Simon Schama]] has called an \"embarrassment of riches\".<ref name=\"Schama\">Schama, Simon, ''The Embarrassment of Riches'', Bath: William Collins & Sons, 1987.

In 1602 the [[Dutch East India Company]] (Dutch: ''Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or ''VOC'') was founded. It was the first-ever [[multinational corporation]], financed by shares that established the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange|first modern stock exchange]]. It became the world's largest commercial enterprise of the 17th century. To finance the growing trade within the region, the [[Bank of Amsterdam]] was established in 1609, the precursor to, if not the first true [[central bank]].<ref>Quinn, Stephen. Roberds, William.

In addition some Portuguese colonies were conquered, namely in Northeastern [[Brazil]], Angola, [[Indonesia]] and [[Ceylon]]. In 1640 by the [[Dutch East India Company]] began a trade monopoly with Japan through the trading post on [[Dejima]].\n\nThe Dutch also dominated trade between European countries. The Low Countries were favorably positioned on a crossing of east-west and north-south trade routes and connected to a large German hinterland through the [[Rhine]] river. Dutch traders shipped wine from France and Portugal to the [[Baltic region|Baltic lands]] and returned with grain destined for countries around the [[Mediterranean Sea]].  By the 1680s, an average of nearly 1000 Dutch ships entered the [[Baltic Sea]] each year.<ref>\"[http://www.balticconnections.net/index.cfm?article=Mercantilism+in+the+West+Baltic Baltic Connections: Mercantilism in the West Baltic]\", BalticConnections.net.

Natuurkundige te Delft Rijksmuseum SK-A-957.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] was a [[businessman]] and [[scientist]] in the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of Dutch science and technology]].]]\n[[Renaissance Humanism]], of which [[Desiderius Erasmus]] (c. 1466\u20131536) was an important advocate, had also gained a firm foothold and was partially responsible for a climate of tolerance. Overall, levels of tolerance were sufficiently high to attract religious refugees from other countries, notably Jewish merchants from [[Portugal]] who brought much wealth with them. The revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] in France in 1685 resulted in the immigration of many French [[Huguenots]], many of whom were shopkeepers or scientists. Still tolerance had its limits, as philosopher [[Baruch de Spinoza]] (1632\u20131677) would find out. Due to its climate of intellectual tolerance the Dutch Republic attracted scientists and other thinkers from all over Europe. Especially the renowned [[University of Leiden]] (established in 1575 by the Dutch [[stadtholder]], [[William the Silent|William of Oranje]], as a token of gratitude for Leiden's fierce resistance against Spain during the Eighty Years' War) became a gathering place for these people. For instance French philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] lived in Leiden from 1628 until 1649.\n\nDutch lawyers were famous for their knowledge of international [[Admiralty law|law of the sea]] and [[commercial law]]. [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583\u20131645) played a leading part in the foundation of [[international law]]. Again due to the Dutch climate of tolerance, book publishers flourished. Many books about religion, philosophy and science that might have been deemed controversial abroad were printed in the Netherlands and secretly exported to other countries. Thus during the 17th century the Dutch Republic became more and more Europe's publishing house.\n\n[[File:Meisje met de parel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Johannes Vermeer]]'s ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'']]\n\n[[Christiaan Huygens]] (1629\u20131695) was a famous [[astronomer]], [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]]. He invented the [[pendulum clock]], which was a major step forward towards exact timekeeping. He contributed to the fields of [[optics]]. The most famous Dutch scientist in the area of optics is certainly [[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]], who invented or greatly improved the [[microscope]] (opinions differ) and was the first to methodically study microscopic life, thus laying the foundations for the field of [[microbiology]]. Famous Dutch hydraulic engineer [[Jan Leeghwater]] (1575\u20131650) gained important victories in The Netherlands's eternal battle against the sea. Leeghwater added a considerable amount of land to the republic by converting several large lakes into [[polder]]s, pumping all water out with windmills.\n\nThe painting was the dominant art form in 17th-century Holland. [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] followed many of the tendencies that dominated [[Baroque art]] in other parts of Europe, as with the [[Utrecht Caravaggisti]], but was the leader in developing the subjects of [[still life]], [[landscape painting|landscape]], and [[genre painting]]. [[Portrait]]ure were also popular, but [[history painting]] \u2013 traditionally the [[hierarchy of genres|most-elevated genre]] struggled to find buyers.  Church art was virtually non-existent, and little sculpture of any kind produced. While art collecting and painting for the open market was also common elsewhere, art historians point to the growing number of wealthy Dutch middle-class and successful mercantile patrons as driving forces in the popularity of certain pictorial subjects.<ref name=\"gardner\">Gardner, Helen, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', Belmont, CA: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005, pp. 718\u201319.</ref> Today, the best-known painters of the Dutch Golden Age are the period's most dominant figure [[Rembrandt]], the [[Delft]] master of genre [[Johannes Vermeer]], the innovative landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]], and [[Frans Hals]], who infused new life into portraiture. Some notable artistic styles and trends include Haarlem [[Mannerism]], [[Utrecht Caravaggism]], the [[Delft School (painting)|School of Delft]], the Leiden [[fijnschilder]]s, and Dutch [[classicism]].\n\n[[File:Den Haag, Mauritshuis vanaf Hofvijver 2006-05-29 16.12.JPG|thumb|The [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Classicist]] [[Mauritshuis]], named after [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen|Prince Johan Maurits]] and built 1636\u20131641, was designed by [[Jacob van Campen]] and [[Pieter Post]].]]\nDue to the thriving economy, cities expanded greatly. New town halls, weighhouses and storehouses were built. Merchants that had gained a fortune ordered a new house built along one of the many new canals that were dug out in and around many cities (for defence and transport purposes), a house with an ornamented fa\u00e7ade that befitted their new status. In the countryside, many new castles and stately homes were built. Most of them have not survived. Starting at 1595 Reformed churches were commissioned, many of which are still landmarks today. The most famous Dutch architects of the 17th century were [[Jacob van Campen]], [[Pieter Post]], Pieter Vingbooms, [[Lieven de Key]], [[Hendrick de Keyser]]. Overall, Dutch architecture, which generally combined traditional building styles with some foreign elements, did not develop to the level of painting.\n\nThe Golden Age was also an important time for developments in literature. Some of the major figures of this period were [[Gerbrand Adriaenszoon Bredero]], [[Jacob Cats]], [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft]] and [[Joost van den Vondel]]. Since Latin was the lingua franca of education, relatively few men could speak, write, and read Dutch all at the same time.\n\nMusic did not develop very much in the Netherlands since the Calvinists considered it an unnecessary extravagance, and organ music was forbidden in Reformed Church services, although it remained common at secular functions.\n\n==Dutch Empire==\n\n=== The Dutch in the Americas ===\n[[File:GezichtOpNieuwAmsterdam.jpg|thumb|left|200px|New Amsterdam in 1664 CE.]]\n{{main|Dutch West India Company|New Netherland|New Amsterdam}}\n\nThe ''Dutch West India Company'' was a [[chartered company]] (known as the \"GWC\") of Dutch [[merchant]]s. On 2 June 1621, it was granted a [[:wikisource:Charter of the Dutch West India Company|charter]] for a trade monopoly in the [[West Indies]] (meaning the Caribbean) by the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]] and given jurisdiction over the [[African slave trade]], Brazil, the [[Caribbean]], and North America. Its area of operations stretched from West Africa to the Americas, and the Pacific islands. The company became instrumental in the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas]]. The first forts and settlements in [[Guyana]] and on the [[Amazon River]] date from the 1590s. Actual colonization, with Dutch settling in the new lands, was not as common as with England and France. Many of the Dutch settlements were lost or abandoned by the end of that century, but the Netherlands managed to retain possession of [[Suriname]] and a number of Dutch Caribbean islands.\n\n[[File:Peter Stuyvesant.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Peter Stuyvesant]], Director-General of [[New Netherland]] (New York). His provincial capital, [[New Amsterdam]], was located at the southern tip of the island of [[Manhattan]].]]\nThe colony was a private business venture to exploit the [[fur trade|fur trade in beaver pelts]]. New Netherland was slowly settled during its first decades, partially as a result of policy mismanagement by the [[Dutch West India Company]] (WIC), and conflicts with Native Americans. During the 1650s, the colony experienced dramatic growth and became a major port for trade in the [[Atlantic World]], tolerating a highly diverse ethnic mix. The surrender of [[Fort Amsterdam]] to the British control in 1664 was formalized in 1667, contributing to the [[Second Anglo\u2013Dutch War]].  In 1673 the Dutch re-took the area, but later relinquished it under the 1674 [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] ending the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]].\n\nDescendants of the original settlers played a prominent role in the [[History of the United States]], as typified by the Roosevelt and Vanderbilt families.

Between 1602 and 1796 the VOC sent almost a million Europeans to work in the Asia trade on 4,785 ships. It returned over 2.5 million tons of Asian trade goods. The VOC enjoyed huge profits from its spice monopoly through most of the 17th century. The VOC was active chiefly in the [[Dutch East Indies]], now [[History of Indonesia|Indonesia]], where its base was [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (now [[Jakarta]]), which remained an important trading concern and paid an 18% annual dividend for almost 200 years; colonized parts of [[Taiwan]] between [[Taiwan under Dutch rule|1624\u20131662 and 1664\u20131667]] and the only western trading post in Japan, [[Dejima]].\n\n[[File:De Lannoy Surrender.JPG|250px|thumb|right|[[Eustachius De Lannoy]] of the [[Dutch East India Company]] surrenders to Maharaja [[Marthanda Varma]] of the [[India]]n [[Kingdom of Travancore]] after the [[Battle of Colachel]].

The marooned crew, the first Europeans to attempt settlement in the area, built a [[fort]] and stayed for a year until they were rescued. Shortly thereafter, the [[Dutch East India Company]] (in the Dutch of the day: ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', or VOC) decided to establish a permanent settlement. The VOC, one of the major European trading houses sailing the [[Spice trade|spice route]] to East Asia, had no intention of colonizing the area, instead wanting only to establish a secure base camp where passing ships could shelter, and where hungry sailors could stock up on fresh supplies of meat, fruit, and vegetables. To this end, a small VOC expedition under the command of [[Jan van Riebeeck]] reached [[Table Bay]] on 6 April 1652.<ref name=\"Noble-141\">{{Cite book|last=Noble|first=John|title=Illustrated Official Handbook of the Cape and South Africa; A r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the history, conditions, populations, productions and resources of the several colonies, states, and territories|publisher=J.C.

This arrangement proved highly successful, producing abundant supplies of fruit, vegetables, wheat, and wine; they also later raised livestock. The small initial group of \"free burghers\", as these farmers were known, steadily increased in number and began to expand their farms further north and east.\n\nThe majority of burghers had [[Dutch (ethnic group)|Dutch ancestry]] and belonged to the [[Calvinist Reformed Church of the Netherlands]], but there were also numerous Germans as well as some Scandinavians. In 1688 the Dutch and the Germans were joined by French [[Huguenots]], also Calvinists, who were fleeing religious persecution in France under [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]]. The [[Huguenots in South Africa]] were absorbed into the Dutch population but they played a prominent role in South Africa's history.\n\nFrom the beginning, the VOC used the cape as a place to supply ships travelling between the Netherlands and the [[Dutch East Indies]]. There was a close association between the cape and these Dutch possessions in the far east. Van Riebeeck and the VOC began to import large numbers of slaves, primarily from [[Madagascar]] and [[Indonesia]]. These slaves often married Dutch settlers, and their descendants became known as the [[Cape Coloureds]] and the [[Cape Malays]].\n\n[[File:Aernout Smit Table Bay, 1683 William Fehr Collection Cape Town.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Table Bay|De Tafelbaai]] by Aernout Smit, 1683.]]\nDuring the 18th century, the Dutch settlement in the area of the cape grew and prospered. By the late 1700s, the [[Dutch Cape Colony|Cape Colony]] was one of the best developed European settlements outside Europe or the Americas.<ref name=\"Smith\">Smith, Adam (1776), [http://www2.hn.psu.edu/faculty/jmanis/adam-smith/Wealth-Nations.pdf Wealth of Nations], Penn State Electronic Classics Edition, republished 2005, p. 516</ref> The two bases of the Cape Colony's economy for almost the entirety of its history were shipping and agriculture. Its strategic position meant that almost every ship sailing between Europe and Asia stopped off at the colony's capital [[Cape Town]]. The supplying of these ships with fresh provisions, fruit, and [[South African wine|wine]] provided a very large market for the surplus produce of the colony.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>\n\nSome free burghers continued to expand into the rugged hinterlands of the north and east, many began to take up a semi-nomadic [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] lifestyle, in some ways not far removed from that of the [[Khoikhoi]] they had displaced. In addition to its herds, a family might have a [[wagon]], a [[tent]], a Bible, and a few guns. As they became more settled, they would build a [[mud]]-walled [[cottage]], frequently located, by choice, days of travel from the nearest European settlement. These were the first of the [[Trekboer]]s (Wandering Farmers, later shortened to [[Boer]]s), completely independent of official controls, extraordinarily self-sufficient, and isolated from the government and the main settlement in [[Cape Town]].\n\n[[File:TrekBoers crossing the Karoo.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An account of the first [[trekboer]]s.]]\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] was the official language, but a dialect had formed that was quite distinct from Dutch.

They seized the Cape Colony in 1795 to prevent it from falling into French hands, then briefly relinquished it back to the Dutch (1803), before definitively conquering it in 1806. British [[sovereignty]] of the area was recognised at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. By the time the Dutch colony was seized by the British in 1806, it had grown into an established settlement with 25,000 slaves, 20,000 white colonists, 15,000 [[Khoisan]], and 1,000 freed black slaves. Outside Cape Town and the immediate hinterland, isolated black and white [[pastoralists]] populated the country.\n\nDutch interest in South Africa was mainly as a strategically located VOC port. Yet in the 17th and 18th centuries the Dutch created the foundation of the modern state of South Africa. The Dutch legacy in South Africa is evident everywhere, but particularly in the [[Afrikaner]] people and the [[Afrikaans]] language.\n\n==Dutch Republic: Regents and Stadholders (1649\u20131784)==\n{{main|Dutch Republic}}\n[[File:Hendrick Avercamp - A Scene on the Ice - WGA01076.jpg|thumb|''Skating fun'', a traditional rural scene by 17th-century Dutch painter [[Hendrick Avercamp]].]]\n\nThe Netherlands gained independence from Spain as a result of the [[Eighty Years' War]], during which the Dutch Republic was founded. As the Netherlands was a republic, it was largely governed by an aristocracy of city-merchants called the [[Regenten|regents]], rather than by a king. Every city and province had its own government and laws, and a large degree of autonomy. After attempts to find a competent sovereign proved unsuccessful, it was decided that [[sovereignty]] would be vested in the various provincial Estates, the governing bodies of the provinces. The [[Estates-General of the Netherlands|Estates-General]], with its representatives from all the provinces, would decide on matters important to the Republic as a whole. However, at the head of each province was the [[stadtholder]] of that province, a position held by a descendant of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]]. Usually the stadtholdership of several provinces was held by a single man.\n\nAfter having gained its independence in 1648, the Netherlands tried in various coalitions to help to contain France, which had replaced Spain as the strongest nation of Europe. The end of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1713) marked the end of the Dutch Republic as a major player. In the 18th century, it just tried to maintain its independence and stuck to a policy of neutrality.\n\nThe economy, based on Amsterdam's role as the center of world trade, remained robust. In 1670 the Dutch merchant marine totalled 568,000 tons of shipping\u2014about half the European total.<ref>{{cite book|author=Tim William Blanning|title=The Pursuit of Glory: Europe, 1648\u20131815|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rmkcaEfwcsQC&pg=PA96|year=2007|publisher=Penguin|page=96|isbn=9780670063208}}</ref>  The province of Holland was highly commercial and dominated the country.  Its nobility was small and closed and had little influence, for it was numerically small, politically weak, and formed a strictly closed caste. Most land in the province of Holland was commercialized for cash crops and was owned by urban capitalists, not nobles; there were few links between Holland's nobility and the merchants. By 1650 the burgher families which had grown wealthy through commerce and become influential in government controlled the province of Holland, and to a large extent shaped national policies. The other six provinces were more rural and traditional in life style, had an active nobility, and played a small role in commerce and national politics.  Instead they concentrated on their flood protections and land reclamation projects.<ref>{{cite book|author=E.H. Kossmann, \"The Dutch Republic,\" in F. L.

Many immigrants came to the cities of Holland in the 17th and 18th century from the Protestant parts of Germany and elsewhere. The amount of first generation immigrants from outside the Netherlands in Amsterdam was nearly 50% in the 17th and 18th centuries. Indeed, Amsterdam's population consisted primarily of immigrants, if one includes second and third generation immigrants and migrants from the Dutch countryside. People in most parts of Europe were poor and many were unemployed. But in Amsterdam there was always work. Tolerance was important, because a continuous influx of immigrants was necessary for the economy. Travellers visiting Amsterdam reported their surprise at the lack of control over the influx.\n\n===Economic growth===\n{{main|Economic history of the Netherlands (1500\u20131815)}}\nThe era of explosive economic growth is roughly coterminous with the period of social and cultural bloom that has been called the [[Dutch Golden Age]], and that actually formed the material basis for that cultural era.  Amsterdam became the hub of world trade, the center into which staples and luxuries flowed for sorting, processing, and distribution, and then reexported around Europe and the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Joost Jonker|title=Merchants, bankers, middlemen: the Amsterdam money market during the first half of the 19th century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8xwWAQAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=NEHA|page=32|isbn=9789057420016}}</ref>\n\nDuring 1585 through 1622 there was the rapid accumulation of trade capital, often brought in by refugee merchantes from Antwerp and other ports.  The money was typically invested in high-risk ventures like pioneering expeditions to the [[East Indies]] to engage in the [[spice trade]]. These ventures were soon consolidated in the [[Dutch East India Company]] ('''VOC'''). There were similar ventures in different fields however, like the trade on Russia and the [[Levant]]. The profits of these ventures were ploughed back in the financing of new trade, which led to its exponential growth.<ref>Charles R. Boxer, ''The Dutch Seaborne Empire 1600\u20131800'' (1965)</ref>\n\nRapid industrialization led to the rapid growth of the nonagricultural labor force and the increase in real wages during the same time. In the half-century between 1570 and 1620 this labor supply increased 3 percent per annum, a truly phenomenal growth. Despite this, nominal wages were repeatedly increased, outstripping price increases. In consequence, real wages for unskilled laborers were 62 percent higher in 1615\u20131619 than in 1575\u20131579.<ref>Jan de Vries and A. van der Woude, ''The First Modern Economy.

The city contributed the largest quota in taxes to the States of Holland which in turn contributed over half the quota to the States General. Amsterdam was also one of the most reliable in settling tax demands and therefore was able to use the threat to withhold such payments to good effect.<ref>Regin, Deric, ''Traders, Artists, Burghers: A Cultural History of Amsterdam in the\n17th century'' Van Gorcum, 1976, p. {{Page needed|date=October 2011}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam was governed by a body of regents, a large, but closed, oligarchy with control over all aspects of the city's life, and a dominant voice in the foreign affairs of Holland. Only men with sufficient wealth and a long enough residence within the city could join the ruling class. The first step for an ambitious and wealthy merchant family was to arrange a marriage with a long-established regent family. In the 1670s one such union, that of the Trip family (the Amsterdam branch of the Swedish arms makers) with the son of Burgomaster Valckenier, extended the influence and patronage available to the latter and strengthened his dominance of the council. The oligarchy in Amsterdam thus gained strength from its breadth and openness. In the smaller towns family interest could unite members on policy decisions but contraction through intermarriage could lead to the degeneration of the quality of the members.\n\nIn Amsterdam the network was so large that members of the same family could be related to opposing factions and pursue widely separated interests.  The young men who had risen to positions of authority in the 1670s and 1680s consolidated their hold on office well into the 1690s and even the new century.<ref>Edwards, Elizabeth, \"Amsterdam and William III,\" ''History Today,'' (Dec 1993), Vol. 43, Issue 12 pp. 25\u201331</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's regents provided good services to residents. They spent heavily on the water-ways and other essential infrastructure, as well as municipal almshouses for the elderly, hospitals and churches.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Elise Van Nederveen Meerkerk|author2=Griet Vermeesch|title=Serving the Urban Community: The Rise of Public Facilities in the Low Countries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GyqI-UjSTy8C&pg=PA158|year=2010|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|page=158|isbn=9789052603506}}</ref>\n\nAmsterdam's wealth was generated by its commerce, which was in turn sustained by the judicious encouragement of entrepreneurs whatever their origin. This open door policy has been interpreted as proof of a tolerant ruling class. But toleration was practiced for the convenience of the city. Therefore, the wealthy Sephardic Jews from Portugal were welcomed and accorded all privileges except those of citizenship, but the poor Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe were far more carefully vetted and those who became dependent on the city were encouraged to move on.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Paolo Bernardini|author2=Norman Fiering|title=The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West, 1400\u20131800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0JAGMuePO0C&pg=PA372|year=2004|publisher=Berghahn Books|page=372|isbn=9781571814302}}</ref> Similarly, provision for the housing of Huguenot immigrants was made in 1681 when [[Louis XIV]]'s religious policy was beginning to drive these Protestants out of France; no encouragement was given to the dispossessed Dutch from the countryside or other towns of Holland.

The former\u2014the Orangists\u2014were soldiers and centralizers who seldom spoke of compromise with the enemy and looked for military solutions. They included many rural gentry as well as ordinary folk attached to the banner of the [[House of Orange-Nassau|House of Orange]].

The regents seized the opportunity: there would be no new stadtholder in Holland for 22 years. [[Johan de Witt]], a brilliant politician and diplomat, emerged as the dominant figure.  Princes of Orange became the stadtholder and an almost hereditary ruler in 1672 and 1748. The Dutch Republic of the United Provinces was a true republic from 1650\u20131672 and 1702\u20131748. These periods are called the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] and [[Second Stadtholderless Period]].\n\n===Anglo-Dutch wars===\n[[File:Vonstetinaseconddayof4daybattleof1666.jpg|thumb|\"The Second Day of the Four Day Battle of 1666\"]]\n{{main|Anglo-Dutch wars}}\nThe Republic and England were major rivals in world trade and naval power. Halfway through the 17th century the Republic's [[Royal Netherlands Navy|navy]] was the rival of Britain's Royal Navy as the most powerful navy in the world.  The Republic fought a series of three [[Anglo-Dutch wars|naval wars against England]] in 1652\u201374.<ref>{{cite book|author=John Richard Hill|title=The Oxford Illustrated History of the Royal Navy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzrya4r-2n8C&pg=PA73|year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=68\u201375|isbn=9780198605270}}</ref>\n\nIn 1651, England imposed its first [[1651 Navigation Act|Navigation Act]], which severely hurt Dutch trade interests. An incident at sea concerning the Act resulted in the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]], which lasted from 1652 to 1654, ending in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)]], which left the Navigation Act in effect.\n\nAfter the [[English Restoration]] in 1660, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] tried to serve his dynastic interests by attempting to make [[William III of England|Prince William III of Orange]], his nephew, [[stadtholder]] of the Republic, using some military pressure. King Charles thought a naval war would weaken the Dutch traders and strengthen the English economy and empire, so the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]] was launched in 1665. At first many Dutch ships were captured and the English scored great victories.  However, the [[Raid on the Medway]], in June 1667, ended the war with a Dutch victory. The Dutch recovered their trade, while the English economy was seriously hurt and its treasury nearly bankrupt.<ref>Gijs Rommelse, \"Prizes and Profits: Dutch Maritime Trade during the Second Anglo-Dutch War,\" ''International Journal of Maritime History'' (2007) 19#2 pp 139\u201359.</ref> The greatly expanded Dutch navy was for years after the world's strongest.

England declared war on the Republic, (the [[Third Anglo-Dutch War]]), followed by France, [[M\u00fcnster]] and [[Cologne]], which had all signed alliances against the Republic. France, Cologne and M\u00fcnster invaded the Republic. Johan de Witt and his brother Cornelis, who had accomplished a diplomatic balancing act for a long time, were now the obvious scapegoats. They were lynched, and a new [[stadtholder]], William III, was appointed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johan-De-Witt|title=Johan De Witt|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2018|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAn Anglo-French attempt to land on the Dutch shore was barely repelled in three desperate naval battles under command of [[Admiral (Netherlands)|Admiral]] [[Michiel de Ruyter]]. The advance of French troops from the south was halted by a costly inundation of its own heartland, by breaching river dikes. With the aid of friendly German princes, the Dutch succeeded in fighting back [[Cologne]] and [[M\u00fcnster]], after which the peace was signed with both of them, although some territory in the east was lost forever. Peace was signed with England as well, in 1674 ([[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Second Treaty of Westminster]]). In 1678, peace was made with France at the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]], although France's Spanish and German allies felt betrayed by this.\n\nIn 1688, the relations with England reached crisis level once again. Stadtholder [[William III of England|William III]] decided he had to take a huge gamble when he was invited to invade England by Protestant British nobles feuding with William's father-in-law the Catholic [[James II of England]]. This led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and cemented the principle of parliamentary rule and Protestant ascendency in England.  James fled to France, and William ascended to the English throne as co-monarch with his wife Mary, James' eldest daughter.  This manoeuvre secured England as a critical ally of the United Provinces in its ongoing wars with [[Louis XIV of France]].  William was the commander of the Dutch and English armies and fleets until his death in 1702.  During William's reign as King of England, his primary focus was leveraging British manpower and finances to aid the Dutch against the French.  The combination continued after his death as the combined Dutch, British, and mercenary army conquered Flanders and Brabant, and invaded French territory before the alliance collapsed in 1713 due to British political infighting.\n\n===Second Stadtholderless Period (1702\u20131747)===\n{{main| Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:Cornelis Troost02.jpg|thumb|The Inspectors of the Collegium Medicum in Amsterdam, by [[Cornelis Troost]], 1724. This period is known as the \"Periwig Era\".]]\n\nThe ''Second Stadtholderless Period'' ({{lang-nl|Tweede Stadhouderloze Tijdperk}}) is the designation in Dutch [[historiography]] of the period between the death of [[stadtholder]] [[William III of England|William III]] on 19 March<ref>This is the date from the [[Gregorian calendar]] that was followed at the time in the Dutch Republic; according to the [[Julian calendar]], still used in England at the time, the date of death was 8 March.</ref> 1702 and the appointment of [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] as stadtholder and captain general in all provinces of the [[Dutch Republic]] on 2 May 1747. During this period the office of stadtholder was left vacant in the provinces of [[Holland]], [[Zeeland]], and [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]], though in other provinces that office was filled by members of the House of Nassau-Dietz (later called Orange-Nassau) during various periods.\n\nDuring the period, the Republic lost its Great-Power status and its primacy in world trade, processes that went hand-in-hand, the latter causing the former. Though the economy declined considerably, causing deindustralization and deurbanization in the maritime provinces, a ''rentier''-class kept accumulating a large capital fund that formed the basis for the leading position the Republic achieved in the international capital market. A military crisis at the end of the period caused the fall of the [[Dutch States Party|States-Party regime]] and the restoration of the Stadtholderate in all provinces. However, though the new stadtholder acquired near-dictatorial powers, this did not improve the situation.\n\n===Economic decline after 1730===\nThe slow economic decline after 1730 was relative: other countries grew faster, eroding the Dutch lead and surpassing it. Wilson identifies three causes. Holland lost its world dominance in trade as competitors emerged and copied its practices, built their own ships and ports, and traded on their own account directly without going through Dutch intermediaries. Second, there was no growth in manufacturing, due perhaps to a weaker sense of industrial entrepreneurship and to the high wage scale. Third the wealthy turned their investments to foreign loans. This helped jump-start other nations and provided the Dutch with a steady income from collecting interest, but leaving them with few domestic sectors with a potential for rapid growth.<ref>C. H. Wilson, \"The Economic Decline of the Netherlands,\" ''Economic History Review'' (1939) 9#2 pp. 111-127, esp. p. 113  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2590218 in JSTOR]</ref><ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic,'' pp. 999\u20131018</ref>\n\nAfter the Dutch fleet declined, merchant interests became dependent on the goodwill of Britain. The main focus of Dutch leaders was reducing the country's considerable budget deficits. Dutch trade and shipping remained at a fairly steady level through the 18th century, but no longer had a near monopoly and also could not match growing English and French competition. The Netherlands lost its position as the trading centre of Northern Europe to London.\n\nAlthough the Netherlands remained wealthy, investors for the nation's money became more difficult to find. Some investment went into purchases of land for estates, but most went to foreign bonds and Amsterdam remained one of Europe's banking capitals.\n\n===Culture and society===\nDutch culture also declined both in the arts and sciences. Literature for example largely imitated English and French styles with little in the way of innovation or originality.  The most influential intellectual was [[Pierre Bayle]] (1647\u20131706), a Protestant refugee from France who settled in Rotterdam where he wrote the massive [[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]] (''Historical and Critical Dictionary'', 1696). It had a major impact on the thinking of [[The Enlightenment]] across Europe, giving an arsenal of weapons to critics who wanted to attack religion. It was an encyclopaedia of ideas that argued that most \"truths\" were merely opinions, and that gullibility and stubbornness were prevalent.<ref>Thomas M. Lennon and Michael Hickson, \"Pierre Bayle,\" ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (2012) [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle/ online]</ref>\n\nLife for the average Dutchman became slower and more relaxed than in the 18th century. The upper and middle classes continued to enjoy prosperity and high living standards. The drive to succeed seemed less urgent. Unskilled laborers remained locked in poverty and hardship. The large underclass of unemployed beggars and riffraff required government and private charity to survive.\n\nReligious life became more relaxed as well. Catholics grew from 18% to 23% of the population during the 18th century and enjoyed greater tolerance, even as they continued to be outside the political system. They became divided by the feud between moralistic Jansenists (who denied free will) and orthodox believers. One group of Jansenists formed a splinter sect, the [[Old Catholic Church]] in 1723. The upper classes willingly embraced the ideas of the Enlightenment, tempered by the tolerance that meant less hostility to organized religion compared to France.<ref>Israel, ''Dutch Republic,'' pp. 1021, 1033\u201336</ref>\n\n===The Orangist revolution (1747\u20131751)===\n{{Main|Second Stadtholderless Period}}\n[[File:StadhouderWillemIV(4).jpg|thumb|left|[[William IV, Prince of Orange]], stadholder from 1747\u20131751 CE.]]\n[[File:Willem v (2).jpg|thumb|left|[[Willem V of Orange]], stadholder from 1751\u20131806, and [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina of Prussia]] with three of their five children.

This started as a Prusso-Austrian conflict, but eventually all the neighbours of the [[Dutch Republic]] became involved. On one side were Prussia, France and their allies and on the other Austria, Britain (after 1744) and their allies. At first the Republic strove to remain neutral in this European conflict, but it maintained garrisons in a number of fortresses in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. French grievances and threats spurred the Republic into bring its army up to European standards (84,000 men in 1743).<ref name=\"Israel\">Israel, Jonathan ''The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness, and Fall 1477\u20131806'' (Oxford\" Oxford U.P. 1998)  pp. 996\u201397, 1069\u201387</ref>\n\nIn 1744 and 1745 the French attacked Dutch fortresses at [[Menen]] and [[Tournai]]. This prompted the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1745 to join the [[War of the Quadruple Alliance|Quadruple Alliance]], but this alliance was severely defeated at the [[Battle of Fontenoy]] in May 1745. In 1746 the French occupied most of the large cities in the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. Then, in April 1747, apparently as an exercise in armed diplomacy, a relatively small French military force occupied [[Zeelandic Flanders]], part of the Dutch Republic.<ref name=\"Israel\"/>\n\nThis relatively innocuous invasion fully exposed the rot underlying the Dutch defences.  The consequences were spectacular.  Still mindful of the French invasion in the [[Rampjaar|\"Disaster Year\" of 1672]], many fearful people clamored for the restoration of the stadtholderate.<ref name=Israel/> [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], had been waiting impatiently in the wings since acquiring his princely title in 1732.  Over the next year he and his supporters engaged in a number of political battles in various provinces and towns in the Netherlands to wrest control from the [[regenten|regents]]. The aim was for William IV to obtain a firm grip on government patronage and place loyal officials in all strategic government positions. Eventually he managed to achieve this aim in all provinces.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n[[Willem Bentinck van Rhoon]] was a prominent Orangist. People like Bentinck hoped that gathering the reins of power in the hands of a single \"eminent head\" would soon help restore the state of the Dutch economy and finances. The regents they opposed included the Grand Pensionary [[Jacob Gilles]] and Adriaen van der Hoop. This popular revolt had religious, anti-Catholic and democratic overtones and sometimes involved mob violence. It eventually involved political agitation by [[Daniel Raap]], [[Jean Rousset de Missy]] and the [[Doelisten]], attacks on [[Tax farming|tax farmers]] ([[pachtersoproer]]), religious agitation for enforcement of the Sabbath laws and preference for followers of [[Gisbertus Voetius]] and various demands by the civil militia.<ref name=Israel/>\n\nThe war against the French was itself brought to a not-too-devastating end for the [[Dutch Republic]] with the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]]. The French retreated of their own accord from the Dutch frontier. William IV died unexpectedly, at the age of 40, on 22 October 1751.<ref name=Israel/>\n\n===Regency and indolent rule (1752\u20131779)===\nHis son, [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], was 3 years old when his father died, and a long regency characterised by corruption and misrule began. His mother delegated most of the powers of the regency to Bentinck and her favorite, [[Duke Louis Ernest of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]]. All power was concentrated in the hands of an unaccountable few, including the Frisian nobleman [[Douwe Sirtema van Grovestins]].<ref name=Israel/> Still a teenager, William V assumed the position of [[stadtholder]] in 1766, the last to hold that office. In 1767, he married [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Princess Wilhelmina of Prussia]], the daughter of [[Prince Augustus William of Prussia|Augustus William of Prussia]], niece of [[Frederick the Great]].\n\nThe position of the Dutch during the [[American War of Independence]] was one of [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]]. William V, leading the pro-British faction within the government, blocked attempts by pro-independence, and later pro-French, elements to drag the government to war. However, things came to a head with the Dutch attempt to join the Russian-led [[First League of Armed Neutrality|League of Armed Neutrality]], leading to the outbreak of the disastrous [[Fourth Anglo-Dutch War]] in 1780. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], the impoverished nation grew restless under William's rule.\n\nAn English historian summed him up uncharitably as \"a Prince of the profoundest lethargy and most abysmal stupidity.\"<ref>Fulford, Roger ''Royal Dukes'' William Collins and Son London 1933</ref> And yet he would guide his family through the difficult French-Batavian period and his son would be crowned king.\n\n===Fourth Anglo-Dutch War (1780\u20131784)===\n{{Main|Fourth Anglo-Dutch War}}\n[[File:The Battle of the Dogger Bank 5 August 1781.jpg|thumb|[[Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)]] by [[Thomas Luny]].]]\nThe [[Fourth Anglo\u2013Dutch War]] (1780\u20131784) was a conflict between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Dutch Republic]].

The [[French Revolution]] resulted first in the establishment of a pro-French [[Batavian Republic]] (1795\u20131806), then the creation of the [[Kingdom of Holland]], ruled by a member of the [[House of Bonaparte]] (1806\u20131810), and finally annexation by the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] (1810\u20131813).\n\n===Patriot rebellion and its suppression (1785\u20131795)===\n{{main|Batavian Revolution}}\n[[File:Jonas Zeuner - Vuurgevecht aan de Vaartse Rijn.jpg|thumb|Firefight on the [[Vaartse Rijn]] at [[Jutphaas]] on 9 May 1787. The pro-revolutionary Utrecht [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] are on the right; the troops of [[stadholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange]] on the left. (Painted by Jonas Zeuner, 1787)]]\n\nInfluenced by the [[American Revolution]], the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriots]] sought a more democratic form of government. The opening shot of this revolution is often considered to be the 1781 publication of a manifesto called ''[[Aan het Volk van Nederland]]'' (\"To the People of the Netherlands\") by [[Joan van der Capellen tot den Pol]], who would become an influential leader of the Patriot movement. Their aim was to reduce corruption and the power held by the [[stadtholder]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]].\n\nSupport for the Patriots came mostly from the middle class. They formed [[militia]]s called ''[[exercitiegenootschap]]pen''. In 1785, there was an open Patriot rebellion, which took the form of an armed insurrection by local militias in certain Dutch towns, ''Freedom'' being the rallying cry. [[Herman Willem Daendels]] attempted to organise an overthrow of various municipal governments ([[vroedschap]]). The goal was to oust government officials and force new elections. \"Seen as a whole this revolution was a string of violent and confused events, accidents, speeches, rumours, bitter enmities and armed confrontations\", wrote French historian [[Fernand Braudel]], who saw it as a forerunner of the [[French Revolution]].\n\nIn 1785 [[William V, Prince of Orange|the stadholder]] left The Hague and moved his court to [[Nijmegen]] in [[Guelders]], a city remote from the heart of Dutch political life. In June 1787, his energetic wife [[Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange|Wilhelmina]] (the sister of [[Frederick William II of Prussia]]) tried to travel to [[The Hague]]. Outside [[Schoonhoven]], she was stopped by Patriot militiamen and taken to a farm near [[Goejanverwellesluis]]. Within two days she was forced to return to Nijmegen, an insult not unnoticed in Prussia.\n\nThe House of Orange reacted with severity, relying on [[Prussia]]n troops led by [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick]] and a small contingent of British troops to [[Prussian invasion of Holland|suppress the rebellion]]. Dutch banks at this time still held much of the world's [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. Government-sponsored banks owned up to 40% of Great Britain's [[national debt]] and there were close connections to the [[House of Stuart]]. The stadholder had supported British policies after the [[American Revolution]].\n\nThis severe military response overwhelmed the Patriots and put the stadholder firmly back in control. A small unpaid Prussian army was billeted in the Netherlands and supported themselves by looting and extortion. The exercitiegenootschappen continued urging citizens to resist the government. They distributed pamphlets, formed \"Patriot Clubs\" and held public [[Demonstration (people)|demonstration]]s. The government responded by pillaging those towns where opposition continued. Five leaders were sentenced to death (but fled first). Lynchings also occurred. For a while, no one dared appear in public without an orange cockade to show their support for [[Orangism (Netherlands)|Orangism]]. Many Patriots, perhaps around 40,000 in all, fled to Brabant, France (especially [[Dunkirk]] and [[Saint-Omer|St. Omer]]) and elsewhere. However, before long the French became involved in Dutch politics and the tide turned.\n\n===Batavian Republic (1795\u20131806)===\n{{Main|Batavian Republic}}\n[[File:Vrijheidsboom.jpg|left|thumb|Liberty tree erected in Dam Square in Amsterdam, 1795 by H. Numan.]]\nThe [[French Revolution]] was popular, and numerous underground clubs were promoting it when in January 1795 the [[Flanders Campaign|French army invaded]]. The underground rose up, overthrew the municipal and provincial governments, and proclaimed the [[Batavian Republic]] ({{lang-nl|Bataafse Republiek}}) [[Batavian Revolution in Amsterdam|in Amsterdam]]. Stadtholder William V fled to England and the States General dissolved itself. The new government was virtually a puppet of France.<ref>C. Cook & J. Stevenson, ''The routledge companion to European history since 1763'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2005), p. 66; J. Dunn, ''Democracy: A history'' (NY: Atlantic Books, 2005), p. 86.</ref>  The Batavian Republic enjoyed widespread support and sent soldiers to fight in the French armies. The 1799 [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] was repulsed by Batavian\u2013French forces. Nevertheless, Napoleon replaced it because the regime of [[Grand Pensionary]] [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] (1805\u201306) was insufficiently docile.<ref>[[R.R.

The 1798 constitution had a genuinely democratic character, though a coup d'\u00e9tat of 1801 put an authoritarian regime in power. Ministerial government was introduced for the first time in Dutch history and many of the current government departments date their history back to this period.  Meanwhile, the exiled stadholder [[Kew Letters|handed over the Dutch colonies]] in \"safekeeping\" to Great Britain and ordered the colonial governors to comply.  This permanently ended the colonial empire in Guyana, Ceylon and the Cape Colony. The Dutch East Indies was returned to the Netherlands under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]].\n\n===Kingdom of Holland to William I (1806\u20131815)===\n[[File:France L-2 (1812)-fr.svg|thumb|Administrative divisions of the [[First French Empire]] in 1812, illustrating the incorporation of the Netherlands and its internal reorganisation.]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Holland}}\n\nIn 1806 Napoleon restyled the Netherlands (along with a small part of what is now Germany) into the [[Kingdom of Holland]], putting his brother [[Louis Bonaparte]] (1778\u20131846), on the throne. The new king was unpopular, but he was willing to cross his brother for the benefit of his new kingdom. Napoleon forced his abdication in 1810 and incorporated the Netherlands directly into the [[First French Empire|French empire]], imposing economic controls and conscription of all young men as soldiers. When the French retreated from the northern provinces in 1813, a [[Driemanschap|Triumvirate]] took over at the helm of a [[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|provisional government]].  Although most members of the provisional government had been among the men who had driven out William V 18 years earlier, the leaders of the provisional government knew that any new regime would have to be headed by his son, William Frederick.  They also knew that it would be better in the long term if the Dutch people themselves installed the prince, rather than have him imposed on the country by the anti-French alliance.  Accordingly, the Triumvirate called William Frederick back on November 30 and offered him the crown.  He refused, but instead proclaimed himself \"[[Sovereign Principality of the United Netherlands|hereditary sovereign prince]]\" on December 6.\n\nThe [[Great Powers]] had [[Eight Articles of London|secretly agreed]] to merge the northern Netherlands with the more populated [[Austrian Netherlands]] and the smaller [[Prince-Bishopric of Li\u00e8ge]] into a single constitutional monarchy.  Having a stronger country on France's northern border was considered (especially by [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander]]) to be an important part of the strategy to keep France's power in check.  In 1814, William Frederick gained sovereignty over the Austrian Netherlands and Li\u00e8ge as well. Thus, William Frederick had fulfilled his family's three-century quest to unite the Low Countries under a single rule.\n\nOn March 15, 1815; with the encouragement of the powers gathered at the [[Congress of Vienna]], William Frederick raised the Netherlands to the status of a kingdom and proclaimed himself [[William I of the Netherlands|King William I]].  This was made official later in 1815, when the Low Countries were formally recognized as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The crown was made a hereditary office of the [[House of Orange-Nassau]].\n\n==United Kingdom of the Netherlands (1815\u20131839)==\n{{Main|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch monarchy}}\n[[File:LandingWillemI.jpg|thumb|left|''Landing of the future king [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] at Scheveningen on 30 November 1813'' by Johan Willem Heyting (1915\u20131995).]]\n[[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] became king and also became the hereditary [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg]], that was part of the Netherlands but at the same time part of the German Confederation. The newly created country had two capitals: [[Amsterdam]] and [[Brussels]]. The new nation had two equal parts. The north (Netherlands proper) had 2 million people. They spoke chiefly Dutch but were divided religiously between a Protestant majority and a large Catholic minority. The south (which would be known as \"Belgium\" after 1830) had a population of 3.4 million people. Nearly all were Catholic, but it was divided between French-speaking Walloons and Dutch-speaking Flemings. The upper and middle classes in the south were mostly French-speaking. About 60,000 Belgians were eligible to vote, compared to about 80,000 Dutchmen.  Officially Amsterdam was the capital, but in a compromise the government met alternately in Brussels and The Hague.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 112\u201333</ref>\n\n[[Adolphe Quetelet]] (1796\u20131874), the great Belgian statistician, calculated that the new nation was significantly better off than other states. Mortality was low, the food supply was good, education was good, public awareness was high and the charity rate was the highest in the world. The best years were in the mid-1820s.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' p 115\u201316</ref>\n\nThe quality of schooling was dismal, however. According to Schama, about 1800 the local school teacher was the \"humble auxiliary of the local priest. Despised by his co-villagers and forced to subsist on the gleanings of the peasants, he combined drumming the catechism into the heads of his unruly charges with the duties of winding the town clock, ringing the church bells or digging its graves. His principal use to the community was to keep its boys out of mischief when there was no labour for them in the fields, or setting the destitute orphans of the town to the 'useful arts' of picking tow or spinning crude flax. As one would expect, standards in such an occupation were dismal.\"<ref>Simon Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" ''History of Education'' (1972) 1:1, pp. 81\u201389 [https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0046760720010106 link]</ref> But in 1806 the Dutch, led by Adriaan van den Ende, energetically set out to modernise education, focusing on a new system for advanced training of teachers with an elaborate system of inspectors, training courses, teacher examinations and teaching societies.  By 1826, although much smaller than France, the Dutch national government was spending 12 times more than Paris on education.<ref>Schama, \"The Rights of Ignorance: Dutch Educational Policy in Belgium 1815\u201330,\" pp. 84\u201385</ref>\n\n===Constitutional monarchy===\n{{stack begin|left|clear=true}}\n[[File:Vereinigteskoenigreich.png|thumb|left|'''The [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)|Limburg]] in 1839'''<br>'''1''', '''2''' and '''3''' United Kingdom of the Netherlands (until 1830)<br>'''1''' and '''2''' [[Netherlands|Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (after 1830)<br>'''2''' [[Duchy of Limburg (1839\u20131867)]] (in the German Confederacy after 1839 as compensation for Waals-Luxemburg)<br>'''3''' and '''4''' [[Belgium|Kingdom of Belgium]] (after 1839)<br>'''4''' and '''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (borders until 1839) <br>'''4''' [[Luxembourg (province)|Province of Luxembourg]] (Waals-Luxemburg, to Belgium in 1839)<br>'''5''' [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] (German Luxemburg; borders after 1839)<br>In blue, the borders of the [[German Confederation]].]]\n{{stack end}}\n\nWilliam I, who reigned from 1815\u20131840, had great constitutional power. An [[enlightened despot]], he accepted the modernizing transformations of the previous 25 years, including equality of all before the law. However, he resurrected the [[Estates of the realm|estates]] as a political class and elevated a large number of people to the nobility. Voting rights were still limited, and only the nobility were eligible for seats in the upper house. The old provinces were reestablished in name only. The government was now fundamentally unitary, and all authority flowed from the center.\n\nWilliam I was a Calvinist and unsympathetic to the religious culture and practices of the Catholic majority.  He promulgated the \"Fundamental Law of Holland\", with some modifications. This entirely overthrew the old order of things in the southern Netherlands: it abolished the privileges of the Catholic Church, and guaranteed equal protection to every religious creed and the enjoyment of the same civil and political rights to every subject of the king. It reflected the spirit of the French Revolution and in so doing did not please the Catholic bishops in the south, who had detested the Revolution.<ref>Godefroid Kurth, \"Belgium\" in [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02395a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907) online]</ref>\n\nWilliam I actively promoted economic modernization. The first 15 years of the Kingdom showed progress and prosperity, as industrialization proceeded rapidly in the south, where the [[Industrial Revolution]] allowed entrepreneurs and labor to combine in a new textile industry, powered by local coal mines. There was little industry in the northern provinces, but most overseas colonies were restored, and highly profitable trade resumed after a 25-year hiatus. Economic liberalism combined with moderate monarchical authoritarianism to accelerate the adaptation of the Netherlands to the new conditions of the 19th century. The country prospered until a crisis arose in relations with the southern provinces.\n\n===Belgium breaks away===\n{{main|Belgian Revolution}}\nWilliam was determined to create a united people, even though the north and south had drifted far apart in the past three centuries. Protestants were the largest denomination in the North (population 2 million), but formed a quarter of the population in the overwhelmingly Catholic South (population 3.5 million). Nevertheless, Protestants dominated William's government and army. The Catholics did not consider themselves an integral part of the United Netherlands, preferring instead to identify with mediaeval Dutch culture. Other factors that contributed to this feeling were economic (the South was industrialising, the North had always been a merchants' nation) and linguistic (French was spoken in [[Wallonia]] and a large part of the bourgeoisie in Flemish cities).{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n \nAfter having been dominant for centuries, the French-speaking elite in the Southern Netherlands now felt like second-class citizens.\nIn the Catholic South,<ref>see [http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/lowcountries/neth18151830.html online maps 1830, 1839]</ref> William's policies were unpopular. The French-speaking Walloons strenuously rejected his attempt to make Dutch the universal language of government, while the population of [[Flanders]] was divided. Flemings in the south spoke a Dutch dialect (\"Flemish\") and welcomed the encouragement of Dutch with a revival of literature and popular culture. Other Flemings, notably the educated bourgeoisie, preferred to speak French. Although Catholics possessed legal equality, they resented their subordination to a government that was fundamentally Protestant in spirit and membership after having been the state church for centuries in the south. Few Catholics held high office in state or army.  Furthermore, political liberals in the south complained about the king's authoritarian methods. All southerners complained of underrepresentation in the national legislature. Although the south was industrializing and was more prosperous than the north the accumulated grievances allowed the multiple opposition forces to coalesce. The outbreak of revolution in France in 1830 was a signal for action, at first on behalf of autonomy for Belgium, as the southern provinces were now called, and later on behalf of total independence. William dithered and his half-hearted efforts to reconquer Belgium were thwarted both by the efforts of the Belgians themselves and by the diplomatic opposition of the great powers.\n\nAt the [[London Conference of 1830]], the chief powers of Europe ordered (in November 1830) an armistice between the Dutch and the Belgians. The first draft for a treaty of separation of Belgium and the Netherlands was rejected by the Belgians. A second draft (June 1831) was rejected by William I, who resumed hostilities. Franco-British intervention forced William to withdraw Dutch forces from Belgium late in 1831, and in 1833 an armistice of indefinite duration was concluded. Belgium was effectively independent but William's attempts to recover Luxembourg and Limburg led to renewed tension. The London Conference of 1838\u201339 prepared the final Dutch-Belgian [[Treaty of London (1839)|separation treaty of 1839]]. It divided Luxembourg and Limburg between the Dutch and Belgian crowns. The Kingdom of the Netherlands thereafter was made up of the 11 northern provinces.<ref>{{cite book|first = J. C.

Griffiths argues that certain government policies facilitated the emergence of a national economy in the 19th century. They included the abolition of internal tariffs and guilds, a unified coinage system, modern methods of tax collection, standardized weights and measures, and the building of many roads, canals, and railroads.  However, compared to Belgium, which was leading in industrialization on the Continent, the Netherlands moved slowly. Possible explanations for this difference are the higher costs due to geography and high wages, and the emphasis of entrepreneurs on trade rather than industry.<ref>Richard T. Griffiths, ''Industrial Retardation in the Netherlands, 1830\u20131850'' (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1979).</ref>\nFor example, in the Dutch coastal provinces agricultural productivity was relatively high. Hence, industrial growth arrived relatively late \u2013 after 1860 \u2013 because incentives to move to labour-intensive industry were quite weak.<ref>{{cite book|author=Baten, J\u00f6rg |title=A History of the Global Economy.

The number of people employed in agriculture decreased, while the country made a strong effort to revive its stake in the highly competitive shipping and trade business. The Netherlands lagged behind Belgium until the late 19th century in industrialization, and caught up around 1920. Major industries included textiles and (later) the great Philips industrial conglomerate. Rotterdam became a major shipping and manufacturing center.<ref>{{cite book|author=Loyen, Reginald|title=Struggling for Leadership: Antwerp-Rotterdam Port.

Born in [[Zundert|Groot-Zundert]], van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on [[20th-century art]].]]\n\nIn 1840 William I abdicated in favor of his son, [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]], who attempted to carry on the policies of his father in the face of a powerful liberal movement. In 1848 [[Revolutions of 1848|unrest broke out all over Europe]]. Although there were no major events in the Netherlands, these foreign developments persuaded King [[William II of the Netherlands|William II]] to agree to liberal and democratic reform. That same year [[Johan Rudolf Thorbecke]], a prominent liberal, was asked by the king to draft a constitution that would turn the Netherlands into a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The new constitution was proclaimed on 3 November 1848. It severely limited the king's powers (making the government accountable only to an elected parliament), and it protected [[civil liberties]]. The new liberal constitution, which put the government under the control of the States General, was accepted by the legislature in 1848.  The relationship between monarch, government and parliament has remained essentially unchanged ever since.\n\nWilliam II was succeeded by [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] in 1849. The new king reluctantly chose Thorbecke to head the new government, which introduced several liberal measures, notably the extension of suffrage. However, Thorbecke's government soon fell, when Protestants rioted against the Vatican's reestablishment of the Catholic episcopate, in abeyance since the 16th century. A conservative government was formed, but it did not undo the liberal measures, and the Catholics were finally given equality after two centuries of subordination. Dutch political history from the middle of the 19th century until the [[First World War]] was fundamentally one of the extension of liberal reforms in government, the reorganization and modernization of the Dutch economy, and the rise of trade unionism and socialism as working-class movements independent of traditional liberalism.  The growth in prosperity was enormous, as real per capita GNP soared from 106 guilders in 1804 to 403 in 1913.<ref>E. H.

In 1816, the government took full control of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] (''Nederlands Hervormde Kerk''). In 1857, all religious instruction was ended in public schools, but the various churches set up their own schools, and even universities. Dissident members broke away from the Dutch Reformed Church in the Secession of 1834. They were harassed by the government under an onerous Napoleonic law prohibiting gatherings of more than 20 members without a permit. After the harassment ended in the 1850s, a number of these dissidents eventually created the Christian Reformed Church in 1869; thousands migrated to Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa in the [[United States]]. By 1900, the dissidents represented about 10% of the population, compared to 45% of the population who were in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], which continued to be the only church to receive state money.<ref>Corwin, \"Holland\" [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc05.h.ix.html  ''The New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge,'' (1914) 5:319\u201322]</ref>\n\nAt mid-century, most Dutch belonged either to the [[Dutch Reformed Church]] or dissenter groups that separated from it (around 55%), or the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (35% to 40%), together with smaller [[Protestant]] (for example, [[Lutheran]]) and Jewish groups. A large and powerful sector of nominal Protestants were in fact secular liberals seeking to minimize religious influence. In reaction a novel alliance developed with Catholics and devout Calvinists joining against secular liberals. The Catholics, who had been loosely allied with the liberals in earlier decades, turned against them on the issue of state support, which the liberals insisted should be granted only to public schools, and joined with Protestant political parties in demanding equal state support to schools maintained by religious groups.<ref>J. C. H. Blom and E. Lamberts, eds. ''History of the Low Countries'' (1999) pp. 387\u2013403</ref>\n\nThe Netherlands remained one of the most tolerant countries in Europe towards religious belief, although conservative Protestants objected to the liberalization of the Dutch Reformed Church during the 19th century and faced opposition from the government when they tried to establish separate communities (Catholics and other non-Protestants were left unmolested by Dutch authorities). Some moved to the United States as a consequence, but as the century drew to a close, religious persecution had totally ceased.\n\n[[File:Old-Amsterdam 1891-street-1.jpg|thumb|Street in Amsterdam in 1891 ({{Interlanguage link multi|Vijzelstraat|nl}} looking towards Muntplein).]]\nDutch social and political life became divided by fairly clear-cut internal borders that were emerging as the society pillarized into three separate parts based on religion.  The economy was not affected. One of the people most responsible for designing pillarization was [[Abraham Kuyper]] (1837\u20131920), a leading politician, [[neo-Calvinist]] theologian, and journalist. Kuyper established orthodox Calvinist organizations, and also provided a theoretical framework by developing such concepts as \"sphere-sovereignty\" that celebrated Dutch society as a society of organized minorities. ''Verzuiling'' (\"pillarization\" or \"pluralism\") after 1850 became the solution to the danger of internal conflict. Everyone was part of one (and only one) pillar (''zuil'') based chiefly on religion (Protestant, Catholic, secular). The secular pillar eventually split into a socialist/working class pillar and a liberal (pro-business) secular pillar. Each pillar built a full set of its own social organizations, including churches (for the religious pillars), political parties, schools, universities,<ref>The oldest universities, in Leiden, Utrecht, and Groningen, had a secular-liberal character. In 1880 Kuyper opened a Protestant university in Amsterdam and in 1923 a Catholic one opened in Nijmegen. The Amsterdam municipal university, which opened in 1877, leaned toward secular-socialism, but was formally neutral.</ref> labor unions, sport clubs, boy scout unions and other youth clubs, and newspapers. The members of different ''zuilen'' lived in close proximity in cities and villages, spoke the same language, and did business with one another, but seldom interacted informally and rarely intermarried.<ref>A Dutch rhyme forbade intermarriage thus: ''Twee geloven op \u00e9\u00e9n kussen, daar slaapt de Duivel tussen'' [Two religions on one pillow, there the Devil sleeps in between.] On the decline of intermarriage see Erik Beekink, et al. \"Changes in Choice of Spouse as an Indicator of a Society in a State of Transition: Woerden, 1830\u20131930.\" ''Historical Social Research'' 1998 23(1\u20132): 231\u201353. {{ISSN|0172-6404}}</ref>  In politics Kuyper formed the [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) in 1879, and headed it until 1905.\n\nPillarization was officially recognized in the [[Pacification of 1917]], whereby socialists and liberals achieved their goal of universal male suffrage and the religious parties were guaranteed equal funding of all schools.<ref>Kossmann, ''Low Countries'' pp-57</ref>  In 1930 radio was organized so that each pillar had full control of its own network.

The world-famous Dutch painter was [[Vincent van Gogh]], but he spent most of his career in France.<ref>Richard Bionda and [[Carel Blotkamp]], eds. ''The Age of Van Gogh: Dutch Painting 1880\u20131895'' (1997)</ref>  Literature, music, architecture and science also flourished. A representative leader of science was [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals]] (1837\u20131923), a working class youth who taught himself physics, earned a PhD at the nation's leading school Leiden University, and in 1910 won the Nobel Prize for his discoveries in thermodynamics. [[Hendrik Lorentz]] (1853\u20131928) and his student [[Pieter Zeeman]] (1865\u20131943) shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in physics.  Other notable scientists included biologist [[Hugo de Vries]] (1848\u20131935), who rediscovered Mendelian genetics.<ref>Leo Beek, ''Dutch Pioneers of Science'' (1986)</ref>\n\n==1900 to 1940==\n[[File:Queen Wilhelmina2.jpg|left|thumb|[[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]], queen of the Netherlands from 1890 to 1948.]]\n\nIn 1890, [[William III of the Netherlands|William III]] died after a long reign and was succeeded by his young daughter, [[Wilhelmina of the Netherlands|Queen Wilhelmina]] (1880-1962). She would rule the Netherlands for 58 years. On her accession to the throne, the [[personal union]] between the Netherlands and Luxembourg ended because Luxembourg law excluded women from rule. Her remote cousin [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] became the Grand Duke of Luxembourg.\n\nThis was a time of further growth and colonial development, but it was marked by the difficulties of the [[World War I]] (in which the Netherlands was neutral) \nand the [[Great Depression]]. The Dutch population grew rapidly in the 20th century, as death rates fell, more lands were opened up, and industrialisation created urban jobs.<ref>Michael Wintle, ''An Economic and Social History of the Netherlands, 1800\u20131920: Demographic, Economic, and Social Transition'' (2000) p. 342</ref>  Between 1900 and 1950 the population doubled from 5.1 to 10 million people.<ref name=\"CBS Statline - Population; history\">[http://statline.cbs.nl/StatWeb/publication/?DM=SLEN&PA=37556ENG&D1=0-44,53-60&D2=1,11,21,31,41,51,61,71,81,91,101&LA=EN&VW=T CBS Statline - Population; history].

It was smaller in 1945 than in 1815 because the Netherlands was the only colonial power that did not expand into Africa or anywhere else.  The empire was run from Batavia (in Java), where the governor and his technical experts had almost complete authority with little oversight from the Hague. Successive governors improved their bureaucratic and military controls, and allowed very little voice to the locals until the 1920s.<ref>Jean Gelman Taylor, ''The Social World of Batavia: Europeans and Eurasians in Colonial Indonesia'' (1983)</ref>\n\nThe colony brought economic opportunity to the mother country and there was little concern at the time about it. One exception came in 1860 when Eduard Dekker, under the pen name \"[[Multatuli]]\" wrote the novel ''[[Max Havelaar: Or the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company]]'', one of the most notable books in the history of [[Dutch literature]]. He criticized the exploitation of the colony and as well had harsh words about the indigenous princes who collaborated with the governor. The book helped inspire the Indonesian independence movement in the mid-20th century as well as the \"[[Fair trade]]\" movement for coffee at the end of the century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Antony Wild|title=Coffee: A Dark History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82ourCcpnpwC&pg=PA258|year=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton|pages=258\u201362}}</ref>\n\nThe military forces in the Dutch East Indies were controlled by the governor and were not part of the regular Dutch army. As the map shows, the Dutch slowly expanded their holdings from their base in Java to include all of modern Indonesia by 1920. Most islands were not a problem but there was a long, costly campaign against the [[Aceh Sultanate|Achin (Aceh)]] state in northern Sumatra.\n\nThe Netherlands had not fought a major military campaign since the 1760s, and the strength of its armed forces had gradually dwindled. The Dutch decided not to ally themselves with anyone, and kept out of all European wars especially the First World War that swirled about it.<ref name = \"hvhqei\">Maartje M. Abbenhuis, ''The Art of Staying Neutral the Netherlands in the First World War, 1914\u20131918'' (Amsterdam University Press, 2006).</ref>\n\n=== Neutrality during the First World War ===\n[[File:Hochspannungszaun Belgien-Holland 1.jpg|thumb|[[Electrified fence]] along the border between the Netherlands and [[Belgium]] during the [[First World War]].]]\n\nThe German war plan (the [[Schlieffen Plan]]) of 1905 was modified in 1908 to invade Belgium on the way to Paris but not the Netherlands. It supplied many essential raw materials to Germany such as rubber, tin, quinine, oil and food. The British used its blockade to limit supplies that the Dutch could pass on.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> There were other factors that made it expedient for both the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and the [[Central Powers]] for the Netherlands to remain neutral. The Netherlands controlled the mouths of the [[Scheldt]], the [[Rhine]] and the [[Meuse River]]s. Germany had an interest in the Rhine since it ran through the industrial areas of the [[Ruhr]] and connected it with the Dutch port of Rotterdam. Britain had an interest in the Scheldt River and the Meuse flowed from France. All countries had an interest in keeping the others out of the Netherlands so that no one's interests could be taken away or be changed. If one country were to have invaded the Netherlands, another would certainly have counterattacked to defend their own interest in the rivers. It was too big a risk for any of the belligerent nations and none wanted to risk fighting on another front.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/>\n\n[[File:Afsluitdijk 01.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Afsluitdijk]], the dike closing off the [[Zuiderzee]], was constructed between 1927 and 1933. Public works projects like this were one way to deal with high unemployment during the [[Great Depression]].]]\nThe Dutch were affected by the war, troops were mobilized and conscription was introduced in the face of harsh criticism from opposition parties. In 1918, mutinies broke out in the military. Food shortages were extensive, due to the control the belligerents exercised over the Dutch. Each wanted their share of Dutch produce. As a result, the price of potatoes rose sharply because Britain had demanded so much from the Dutch. Food riots even broke out in the country.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> A big problem was smuggling. When Germany had conquered Belgium, the Allies saw it as enemy territory and stopped exporting to Belgium. Food became scarce for the Belgian people, since the Germans seized all food. This gave the Dutch the opportunity to start to smuggle. This, however, caused great problems in the Netherlands, including inflation and further food shortages. The Allies demanded that the Dutch stop the smuggling, and the government took measures to remain neutral. The government placed many cities under 'state of siege'. On 8 January 1916, a {{convert|5|km|mi|adj=on}} zone was created by the government along the border. In that zone, goods could be moved on main roads with a permit.<ref name = \"hvhqei\"/> German authorities in Belgium had an electrified fence erected all along the Belgian\u2013Dutch border that caused many refugees from Belgium to lose their lives.  The fence was guarded by older German Landsturm soldiers.<ref>{{cite web|title=De Dodendraad \u2013 Wereldoorlog I|url=http://www.bunkergordel.be/14.023%20De%20Dodendraad.htm|publisher=Bunkergordel.be|accessdate=19 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Interwar period ===\n{{Main|Great Depression in the Netherlands}}\nAlthough both houses of the Dutch Parliament were elected by the people, only men with high incomes were eligible to vote until 1917, when pressure from socialist movements resulted in elections in which all men regardless of income, were entitled to vote. In 1919, women also obtained the right to vote for the first time in history.\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]] which began after the tumultous events of [[Black Tuesday]] in 1929, that continued into the early-1930s had crippling effects on the Dutch economy; lasting longer than in most other European countries. The long duration of the Great Depression in the Netherlands is often explained by the very strict fiscal policy of the Dutch government at the time, and its decision to adhere to the [[gold standard]] for much longer than most of its trading partners. The Great Depression led to high unemployment and widespread poverty, as well as increasing social unrest.\n\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany did not go unnoticed in the Netherlands, and there was growing concern at the possibility of armed conflict, but most Dutch people expected that Germany would again respect Dutch neutrality.\n\nThere were separate fascist and Nazi movements in the 1930s. Dutch Fascists admired Mussolini's Italy and called for a traditional corporate ideology. The membership was small, elitist and ineffective. The pro-Nazi movement, however, won support from [[Berlin]] and attempted to build a mass base by 1935. It failed because most Dutch rejected its racial ideology and calls for violence.<ref>Erik Hansen, \"Fascism and Nazism in the Netherlands 1929\u201339,\" ''European Studies Review'' (1981) 11#3 pp. 355\u201385. [http://ehq.sagepub.com/content/11/3/355.extract online at Sage]</ref>\n\nThe defence budget was not increased until Germany remilitarised the [[Rhineland]] in 1936. The budget was further increased in 1938 (after the [[Anschluss|annexation of Austria]] and occupation of the Czech [[Sudetenland]]). The colonial government also increased its military budget because of increasing tensions with Japan. The Dutch did not mobilise their armed forces until shortly before France and the UK declared war on Germany in September 1939 after the invasion of Poland. Neutrality was still the official policy, but the Dutch government tried to buy new arms for their badly equipped forces; however, a considerable share of ordered weapons never arrived.\n\n==The Second World War (1939\u20131945)==\n{{Main|History of the Netherlands (1939\u20131945)}}\n\n===Nazi invasion and occupation===\n{{Main|Battle of the Netherlands|Rotterdam Blitz|Dutch resistance}}\n[[File:Rotterdam, Laurenskerk, na bombardement van mei 1940.jpg|thumb|Rotterdam was destroyed by German bombers on 14 May 1940. 814 people died in the [[Rotterdam Blitz]].]]\n\nAt the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the Netherlands once again declared its [[neutral country|neutrality]]. However, on 10 May 1940, [[Nazi Germany]] launched an attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and quickly overran most of the two countries. Fighting against the Dutch army proved to be more of a burden than foreseen; the northern attack was stopped dead, the one in the middle came to a grinding halt near the Grebbeberg and many airborne assault troops were killed and taken prisoner in the west of the country.\nOnly in the south were defences broken, but the one passage over the River Maas at Rotterdam was held by the Dutch. By 14 May, fighting in many locations had ceased and the German army could make little or no headway, so the [[Luftwaffe]] bombed [[Rotterdam]], the second-largest city of the Netherlands, killing about 900 people, destroying most of the inner city and leaving 78,000 people homeless.\n\nFollowing the bombing and German threats of the same treatment for [[Utrecht]], the Netherlands capitulated on 15 May, except for the province of [[Zeeland]] where French and French-Moroccan troops stood side-by-side with the Dutch army. Still, the Dutch Royal Family along with some armed forces fled to the United Kingdom. Some members of the Dutch Royal Family eventually moved to [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada until the Netherlands was liberated five years later.[[Princess Margriet of the Netherlands|Princess Margriet]] was born in Canada, during the period the family spent in exile.\n\nResentment of the Germans grew as the occupation became more harsh, prompting many Dutch in the latter years of the war to join the [[Dutch resistance|resistance]]. But collaboration was not uncommon either; many thousands of young Dutch males volunteered for combat service on the Russian Front with the [[Waffen-SS]] and many companies worked for the German occupiers.\n\n===Holocaust in the Netherlands===\n{{double image|right|Exhibit of the Anne Frank Zentrum.jpg|200|WWII netherlands persoonsbewijs.jpg|165|Yellow [[Star of David]] with ''Jood'', the Dutch word for \"[[Jew]]\".|[[Identification papers]] issued to Dutch people during the war.}}\nAbout 140,000 Jews lived in the Netherlands at the beginning of the war. Persecution of [[Dutch Jews]] started shortly after the occupation. At the end of the war, 40,000 Jews were still alive. Of the 100,000 Jews who did not go into hiding, about 1,000 survived the war.\n\nOne famous victim of the Holocaust was [[Anne Frank]], who gained worldwide fame when her diary, written in the ''achterhuis'' ('backhouse') while hiding from the Nazis, was found and published  posthuously by her father, Otto Frank; who was the only member of the family to survive the Holocaust.\n\n===The war in the Dutch East Indies===\n{{Main|Dutch East Indies campaign}}\nOn 8 December 1941, the day after the attack on [[Pearl Harbor]], the Netherlands declared war on Japan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pha/policy/1941/411208c.html |title=THE KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS DECLARES WAR WITH JAPAN |publisher=ibiblio |accessdate=5 October 2009}}</ref> The Dutch government-in-exile in London had for long been working with the UK & US governments to cut off oil supplies to Japan. Japanese forces [[Netherlands East Indies campaign|invaded the Dutch East Indies]] on 11 January 1942. The Dutch surrendered on 8 March after Japanese troops landed on [[Java island|Java]]. Dutch citizens and everybody with Dutch ancestry, the so-called \"[[Indo people|Indo's]]\" were captured and put to work in labour camps or interned. As in the Netherlands, many Dutch ships, planes and military personnel managed to reach safety, in this case [[Australia]]; from where they were able to fight again.\n\n===False hopes, the Hunger Winter and Liberation===\nIn Europe, after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] landed in [[Normandy]] in June 1944, progress was slow until the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] ended in August 1944. German resistance collapsed in Western Europe and the allied armies advanced quickly towards the Dutch border. The [[First Canadian Army]] and the Second British Army conducted operations on Dutch soil from September onwards. On 17 September, a daring operation, [[Operation Market Garden]]; was executed with the goal of capturing bridges across three major rivers in the southern Netherlands. Despite desperate fighting by American, British and Polish forces, the bridge at [[Arnhem]], across the Neder Rijn, could not be captured.\n\nAreas south of the Rhine river were liberated in the period September\u2013December 1944, including the province of Zeeland, which was liberated in October and November in the [[Battle of the Scheldt]]. This opened [[Antwerp]] to allied shipping. The [[First Canadian Army]] held a static line along the [[river Meuse]] (Maas) from December 1944 through February 1945.\n\nThe rest of the country remained occupied until the spring of 1945. In the face of Dutch defiance, the Nazis deliberately cut off food supplies resulting in near-starvation in the cities during the ''[[Hongerwinter]]'' ([[Hunger winter]]) of 1944\u201345. Soup kitchens were set up but many vulnerable people died.<ref>William I. Hitchcock, ''The Bitter Road to Freedom: The Human Cost of Allied Victory in World War II Europe'' (2009) pp. 98\u2013129</ref>  A few days before the Allied victory, the Germans allowed emergency shipments of food.\n\n[[File:Crowd of Dutch civilians celebrating the liberation of Utrecht by the Canadian Army.jpg|thumb|Dutch civilians celebrating the arrival of [[I Canadian Corps]] troops in [[Utrecht]] after the German surrender, 7 May 1945.]]\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] launched [[Operation Veritable]] in early-February, cracking the [[Battle of the Siegfried Line|Siegfried Line]] and reaching the banks of the [[Rhine]] in early-March. In the final weeks of the war in Europe, the First Canadian Army was charged with clearing the [[Netherlands]] of German forces.\n\nThe [[Liberation of Arnhem]] began on 12 April 1945 and proceeded to plan, as the three infantry brigades of the 49th Division leapfrogged each other through the city. Within four days Arnhem, now a ruined city, was totally under Allied control.<ref>Waddy, John A Tour of the Arnhem Battlefields (Pen & Sword Books, 2001; first published 1999) ({{ISBN|0-85052-571-3}}), p. 192</ref>\n\nThe Canadians then immediately advanced further into the country, encountering and defeating a German counterattack at [[Otterlo]] and Dutch SS resistance at [[Ede, Netherlands|Ede]]. On 27 April a temporary truce came into effect, allowing the distribution of food aid to the starving Dutch civilians in areas under German control ([[Operations Manna and Chowhound|Operation Manna]]). On 5 May 1945, Generaloberst [[Johannes Blaskowitz|Blaskowitz]] agreed to the unconditional surrender of all German forces in the Netherlands, signing the surrender to Canadian general [[Charles Foulkes (Canadian general)|Charles Foulkes]] at [[Wageningen]].<ref>Stacey, Colonel Charles Perry, ''Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War'', Volume III, ''[http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/his/docs/Victory_e.pdf The Victory Campaign: The Operations in North-West Europe 1944\u20131945]'' (The Queen's Printer and Controller of Stationery Ottawa, 1960) (Downloaded: 4 July 2009), pp. 576\u2013614</ref> (The Fifth of May is now celebrated annually in the Netherlands as [[Liberation Day]].) Three days later Germany unconditionally surrendered, bringing the war in Europe to an end.\n\nAfter the euphoria and settling of scores had ended, the Dutch were a traumatised people with a ruined economy, a shattered infrastructure and several destroyed cities including [[Rotterdam]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Arnhem]] and part of [[The Hague]].\n\n===Post-war events===\n\nAfter the war, there were reprisals against those who had collaborated with the Nazis. [[Artur Seyss-Inquart]], Nazi Commissioner of the Netherlands, was tried at N\u00fcremberg.\n\nIn the early post-war years, the Netherlands made continued attempts to expand its territory by annexing neighbouring German territory. The [[Bakker-Schut Plan|larger annexation plans]] were continuously rejected by the United States, but the London conference of 1949 permitted the Netherlands to perform a smaller scale [[annexation]]. Most of the annexed territory was returned to Germany on 1 August 1963.<ref>[http://geschiedenis.vpro.nl/programmas/2899536/afleveringen/3606801/ 'Eisch Duitschen grond!'] 3 May 2001 In Dutch.

''Four Centuries of Dutch-American Relations: 1609-2009'' (2009) pp 761-72.</ref>\n\nThe 1948 elections led to a new coalition led by Labor's [[Willem Drees]]. He led four successive cabinets [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-1|Drees I]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-2|Drees II]], [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-3|Drees III]] and [[Netherlands cabinet Drees-4|Drees IV]] until 1958. His tenurein office saw four major political developments: the traumas of decolonisation, [[economic reconstruction]], the establishment of the Dutch [[welfare state]], and international integration and co-operation, including the formation of [[Benelux]], the [[OEEC]], [[NATO]], the [[European Coal and Steel Community|ECSC]], and the [[EEC]].\n\n===Baby boom and economic reconstruction===\n[[File:Population of the Netherlands 1900-2000.png|thumb|left|Population growth 1900\u20132000]]\n\nDespite the socio-economic problems, this was a period of optimism for many. A baby boom followed the war, as young Dutch couples started the families they couldn't previously due to the war. They had lived through the hardships of the Great Depression and the hell of war. They wanted to start afresh and live better lives without the poverty, starvation, terror, and extreme frugality they knew so well. They had little taste for a strictly imposed rule-oriented traditional system with its rigid hierarchies, sharp pillarised boundaries and strictly orthodox religious doctrines. The translation of ''The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care'' (1946), by American pediatrician [[Benjamin Spock]] was a best-seller. His vision of family life as companionate, permissive, enjoyable and even as being fun took hold, and seemed the best way to achieve family happiness in a dawning age of freedom and prosperity.<ref name=\"Janneke Wubs 2002 pp 209\">Nelleke Bakker and Janneke Wubs, \"A Mysterious Success: Doctor Spock and the Netherlands in the 1950s\", ''Paedagogica Historica'' (2002) 38#1 pp. 209\u201326.</ref>\n\nWages were kept low and the recovery of consumption to pre-war levels was delayed to permit rapid rebuilding of the infrastructure. In the years after the war, unemployment fell and the economy grew at an astonishing pace, despite the high birth rate. The shattered infrastructure and destroyed cities were rebuilt. A key contribution to the recovery in the post-war Netherlands came from the [[Marshall Plan]], which provided the country with funds, goods, raw materials and produce.<ref>Van der Eng, Pierre (1987). ''De Marshall-Hulp, Een Perspectief voor Nederland 1947\u20131953.'' Houten: De Haan.</ref>\n\nThe Dutch became internationally active again. Dutch corporations, particularly [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and [[Philips]], became internationally prominent. Businesspeople, scientists, engineers and artists from the Netherlands made important international contributions. For example, Dutch economists, especially [[Jan Tinbergen]] (1903\u20131994), [[Tjalling Koopmans]] (1910\u20131985) and [[Henri Theil]] (1924\u20132000), made major contributions to the mathematical and statistical methodology known as [[econometrics]].<ref>Andrew J. Hughes Hallett, \"Econometrics and the Theory of Economic Policy: The Tinbergen-Theil Contributions 40 Years On,\" ''Oxford Economic Papers'' (1989) 41#1 pp. 189\u2013214</ref>\n\nAcross Western Europe, the period from 1973-81 marked the end of the booming economy of the 1960s. The Netherlands also experienced years of negative growth after that. Unemployment increased steadily, causing rapid growth in social-security expenditures. Inflation reached double digits; government surpluses disappeared. On the positive side, rich natural gas resources were developed, providing a current account trade surplus during most of the period. Public deficits were high.<ref>Green-Pedersen, ''The Politics of Justification: Party Competition and Welfare-State Retrenchment in Denmark and the Netherlands from 1982-1998'' p. 44</ref> According to the long-term economic analysis of Horlings and Smits, the major gains in the Dutch economy were concentrated between 1870-1930 and between 1950\u201370.

Viewed from a U.S. Army helicopter, a Zuid Beveland town gives a hint of the tremendous damage wrought... - NARA - 541705.tif|thumb|A town in [[Zuid Beveland]] inundated in 1953.]]\n\nThe [[North Sea flood of 1953|last major flood in the Netherlands]] took place in early-February 1953, when a huge storm caused the collapse of several dikes in the southwest of the Netherlands. More than 1,800 people drowned in the ensuing inundation.\n\nThe Dutch government subsequently decided on a large-scale programme of public works (the \"[[Deltawerken|Delta Works]]\") to protect the country against future floods. The project took more than thirty years to complete. The Oosterscheldedam, an advanced sea storm barrier, became operational in 1986. According to Dutch government engineers, the odds of a major inundation anywhere in the Netherlands are now one in 10,000 years.\n\n===Europeanisation, Americanisation and internationalisation===\nThe [[European Coal and Steel Community]] (ECSC), was founded in 1951 by the six founding members: Belgium, the Netherlands and [[Luxembourg]] (the [[Benelux]] countries) and West Germany, France and Italy. Its purpose was to pool the steel and coal resources of the member states, and to support the economies of the participating countries. As a side effect, the ECSC helped defuse tensions between countries which had recently been fighting each other during the war. In time, this economic merger grew, adding members and broadening in scope, to become the [[European Economic Community]], and later the [[European Union]] (EU).\n\nThe United States started to have more influence.

However, the Netherlands was much too weak to reconquer Indonesia. The Japanese had imprisoned all the Dutch residents, and turned the islands over to a native government, which was widely popular. The British military arrived to disarm the Japanese. The Dutch finally returned and attempted to eradicate the [[Indonesian National Revolution]] with force, (sometimes [[Rawagede massacre|brutal]] in nature).<ref>Gert Oostindie, et al. \"The decolonization war in Indonesia, 1945-1949: War crimes in Dutch veterans' egodocuments.\" ''War in History'' (2018) 25#2 pp 254-276, argues that \"war crimes formed a structural ingredient of Dutch warfare.\"</ref>\n\nHundreds of thousands of Indonesians supported the Dutch position; when Independence finally arrived, most of them were relocated to the Netherlands. The UK mediated a compromise signed in March 1947 whereby de facto control of the new [[Indonesian Republic]] was acknowledged over Java, Maduro and Sumatra, while acknowledging Dutch control over the numerous smaller and far less important islands. Supposedly there would be a federated Indonesian state and a union with the Netherlands, but that never happened. The Indonesians wanted complete transfer of power, and the Dutch refused. By 1946, the United States was financing the Dutch in Indonesia, and was able to exert pressure on The Hague.  Increasing international pressure\u2014including American hints about cutting off military funds\u2014forced the Netherlands to withdraw. A decisive episode was the success of the Indonesian Republic in crushing a Communist revolt. Washington now realised that Indonesia was part of the Cold War fight against communism, and the Indonesian government was a necessary ally\u2014and that the Dutch tactics were counterproductive and chaotic, and could only provide help to Communist insurgencies.<ref>{{cite book|author=Frances Gouda|title=American Visions of the Netherlands East Indies/Indonesia: US Foreign Policy and Indonesian Nationalism, 1920-1949|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zh1VtsxRlRAC&pg=PA36|year=2002|publisher=Amsterdam UP|pages=36, 196}}</ref> The Netherlands formally recognised Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949.

In fact, the demand for labour was so strong that immigration was actively encouraged, first from Italy and Spain then later on, in larger numbers, from [[Turkey]] and [[Morocco]].\n\n[[Suriname]] became independent on 25 November 1975. The Dutch government supported independence because it wanted to stem the flow of immigrants from Suriname and also to end its colonial status. However, about one-third of the entire population of Suriname, fearing political unrest and economic decline, relocated to the Netherlands, creating a Surinamese community in the Netherlands that is now roughly as large as the population of Suriname itself.\n\n===Liberalisation===\nWhen the post-war baby boom children grew up, they led the revolt in the 1960s against all rigidities in Dutch life.<ref name=\"Janneke Wubs 2002 pp 209\"/> The 1960s and 1970s were a time of great social and cultural change, such as rapid ''[[pillarization|ontzuiling]]'' (literally: depillarisation), a term that describes the decay of the old divisions along class and religious lines.<ref>Christopher G.

This [[purple (government)]] coalition marked the first absence of the CDA in a government for decades. During the Purple Coalition years, a period lasting until the rise of the populist politician [[Pim Fortuyn]], the government addressed issues previously viewed as taboo under the Christian-influenced cabinet. At this time, the Dutch government introduced unprecedented legislation based on a policy of official tolerance (''gedoogbeleid''). Abortion and [[euthanasia]] were decriminalised, but stricter guidelines were set for their implementation. Drug policy, especially with regard to the regulation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], was reformed. Prostitution was legalised, but confined to brothels where the health and safety of those involved could be properly monitored. With the 2001 [[Same-sex marriage in the Netherlands|Same-Sex Marriage Act]], the Netherlands became the first country in the world to legalise [[same-sex marriage]].

One week later, several arrests were made of several would-be Islamic terrorists, who have later been found guilty of conspiracy with terrorist intentions, this verdict was however reversed on appeal. All this sparked a debate on the position of Islamic extremism and of Islam generally in Dutch society, and on immigration and integration.

In 3500 pages he crafted a literary masterpiece that was translated into numerous languages; his dramatic story reached a wide audience in the 19th century. Motley relied heavily on Dutch scholarship and immersed himself in the sources. His style no longer attracts readers, and scholars have moved away from his simplistic dichotomies of good versus evil, Dutch versus Spanish, Catholic versus Protestant, freedom versus authoritarianism. His theory of causation over-emphasized ethnicity as an unchanging characteristic, exaggerated the importance of William of Orange, and gave undue importance to the issue religious tolerance.<ref>Robert Wheaton, \"Motley and the Dutch Historians,\" ''New England Quarterly'' (1962) 35#3 pp. 318\u201336 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/363823 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\nThe pioneering Dutch cultural historian [[Johan Huizinga]] (1872\u20131945), author of ''The Autumn of the Middle Ages'' (1919) (the English translation was called ''The Waning of the Middle Ages'') and ''Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play Element in Culture'' (1935), which expanded the field of cultural history and influenced the historical anthropology of younger historians of the French [[Annales School]]. He was influenced by art history and advised historians to trace \"patterns of culture\" by studying \"themes, figures, motifs, symbols, styles and sentiments.\"<ref>Peter Burke, \"Historians and Their Times: Huizinga, Prophet of 'Blood and Roses.'\" ''History Today'' (Nov 1986) (36): 23\u201328; William U.

The polder model stresses the need for finding consensus; it discourages furious debate and angry dissent in both academia and politics \u2013 in contrast to the highly developed, intense debates in Germany.<ref>Chris Lorenz, \"Het 'Academisch Poldermodel' En De Westforschung in Nederland,\" [The Dutch Academic Polder Model and Westforschung in the Netherlands].

Cruz (2007) explains the major debates among scholars regarding the Dutch bid for independence from Spanish rule. While agreeing that the intellectual milieus of late 19th and 20th centuries affected historians' interpretations, Cruz argues that writings about the revolt trace changing perceptions of the role played by small countries in the history of Europe.  In recent decades grand theory has fallen out of favor among most scholars, who emphasize the particular over the general. Dutch and Belgian historiography since 1945 no longer says the revolt was the culmination of an inevitable process leading to independence and freedom. Instead scholars have put the political and economic details of the towns and provinces under the microscope, while agreeing on the weaknesses of attempts at centralization by the Habsburg rulers. The most influential new studies have been rooted in demographic and economic history, though scholars continue to debate the relationship between economics and politics. The religious dimension has been viewed in terms of mentalities, exposing the minority position of Calvinism, while the international aspects have been studied more seriously by foreign historians than by the Dutch themselves.<ref>Laura Cruz, \"The 80 Years' Question: the Dutch Revolt in Historical Perspective.\"  ''History Compass'' 2007 5(3): 914\u201334.</ref>\n\n[[Pieter Geyl]] was the leading historian of the Dutch Revolt, and a highly influential professor at the University of London (1919\u20131935) and at the State University of Utrecht (1936\u201358). He wrote a six-volume history of the Dutch-speaking peoples.<ref>Three volumes appeared in English translation, ''The Revolit of the Netherlands (1555\u20131609)'' (1932); and ''The Netherlands in the Seventeenth Century'' (2 vol 1936, 1964).</ref> The Nazis imprisoned him in World War II. In his political views, Geyl adopted the views of the 17th-century Dutch Louvestein faction, led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt (1547\u20131619) and Johan de Witt (1625\u201372). It stood for liberty, toleration, and national interests in contrast to the Orange stadholders who sought to promote their own self-interest. According to Geyl, the Dutch Republic reached the peak of its powers during the 17th century. He was also a staunch nationalist and suggested that Flanders could split off from Belgium and join the Netherlands. Later he decried what he called radical nationalism and stressed more the vitality of Western Civilization. Geyl was highly critical of the [[world history]] approach of [[Arnold J. Toynbee]].<ref>Herbert H. Rowen, \"The Historical Work of Pieter Geyl.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 1965 37(1): 35\u201349. {{ISSN|0022-2801}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1874563 in Jstor]</ref>\n\n[[Jan Romein]] (1893-1962) created a \"theoretical history\" in an attempt to reestablish the relevance of history to public life in the 1930s at a time of immense political uncertainty and cultural crisis, when Romein thought that history had become too inward-looking and isolated from other disciplines. Romein, a Marxist, wanted history to contribute to social improvement. At the same time, influenced by the successes of theoretical physics and his study of [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Frederick John Teggart]], and others, he spurred on the development of theoretical history in the Netherlands, to the point where it became a subject in its own right at the university level after the war. Romein used the term integral history as a substitute for cultural history and focused his attention on the period around the turn of the century. He concluded that a serious crisis occurred in European civilization in 1900 because of the rise of anti-Semitism, extreme nationalism, discontent with the parliamentary system, depersonalization of the state, and the rejection of positivism. European civilization waned as the result of this crisis which was accompanied by the rise of the United States, the Americanization of the world, and the emergence of Asia. His interpretation is reminiscent of that of his mentor Johan Huizinga and was criticized by his colleague Pieter Geyl.<ref>A. C.

It incorporates elements of dark humor and [[existentialist]] drama. The plot revolves around the exploits of a young man named Harold Chasen ([[Bud Cort]]) who is intrigued with death. Harold drifts away from the life that his detached mother ([[Vivian Pickles]]) prescribes for him, and slowly develops a strong [[Romantic friendship|friendship]], and eventually a [[romantic relationship]], with a 79-year-old woman named Maude ([[Ruth Gordon]]) who teaches Harold about living life to its fullest and that life is the most precious gift of all.\n\nThe film was based on a screenplay written by [[Colin Higgins]] and published as a novel in 1971. Filming locations in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] included both [[Holy Cross Cemetery (Colma, California)|Holy Cross Cemetery]] and [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]], and the ruins of the [[Sutro Baths]].\n\nCritically and commercially unsuccessful when originally released, the film developed a [[cult following]] and in 1983 began making a profit.<ref name=\"times\" /><ref name=\"Peary\">{{cite book | authorlink = Danny Peary | first = Danny | last = Peary | title = [[Cult Movies (book)|Cult Movies]] | publisher = Delta Books | year = 1981 | ISBN = 0-517-20185-2 }}</ref> The film is ranked number 45 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s list of 100 Funniest Movies of all Time and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]] in 1997, for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\".<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/film/titles.html National Film Registry list of films 1989-2006].

He is entranced by her quirky outlook on life, which is bright and excessively carefree in contrast with his morbidity. The pair form a bond and Maude shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (including how to play [[banjo]]), and teaches him how to \"[make] the most of his time on earth\".<ref name=\"Allmovie\"/> Meanwhile, Harold's mother is determined, against Harold's wishes, to find him a wife. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed dates, by appearing to commit gruesome acts such as [[self-immolation]], [[self-mutilation]] and [[seppuku]]. She tries enlisting him in the military instead, but he deters his recruiting officer uncle by staging a scene in which Maude poses as a pacifist protester and Harold seemingly murders her out of militaristic fanaticism.\n\nWhen Harold and Maude are talking at her home he tells her, without prompting, the motive for his fake suicides: When he was at boarding school, he accidentally caused an explosion in his chemistry lab, leading police to assume his death. Harold returned home just in time to witness his mother react to the news of his death with a ludicrously dramatized faint. As he reaches this part of the story, Harold bursts into tears and says, \"I decided then I enjoyed being dead.\"\n\nAs they become closer, their friendship soon blossoms into a [[Romance (love)|romance]] and Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, analyst, and priest. Maude's 80th birthday arrives, and Harold throws a surprise party for her. As the couple dance, Maude tells Harold that she \"couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.\" Confused, he questions Maude as to her meaning and she reveals that she has taken an [[overdose]] of [[Hypnotic|sleeping pills]] and will be dead by morning. She restates her firm belief that eighty is the proper age to die.\n\nHarold rushes Maude to the hospital, where she is treated unsuccessfully and dies. In the final sequence, Harold's car is seen going off a seaside cliff but after the crash, the final shot reveals Harold standing calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo. After gazing down at the wreckage, he dances away, picking out on his banjo [[Cat Stevens]]' song \"[[If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Ruth Gordon]] as Dame Marjorie \"Maude\" Chardin, a 79-year-old free spirit who wears her hair in braids. Maude believes in living each day to its fullest, and \"trying something new every day\". Her view of life is so joyful that, true to the film's motif, it crosses a blurred, shifting line into a carefree attitude toward death as well. We know little of her past, but learn that as a young woman she lived in pre-war Vienna, was once married and has a [[Nazi concentration camp]] tattoo on one arm.\n*[[Bud Cort]] as Harold Parker Chasen, an 18-year-old man who is obsessed with death. He drives a hearse, attends funerals of strangers and stages elaborate fake suicides. Through meeting and falling in love with Maude, he discovers joy in living for the first time.\n*[[Vivian Pickles]] as Mrs. Chasen, Harold's opulently wealthy mother, is controlling, snooty and seemingly incapable of affection. Hoping to force him into respectability, Mrs. Chasen replaces Harold's beloved hearse with a Jaguar (which he then converts to a miniature hearse) and sets up several blind dates, or more accurately, \"bride interviews\" with young women.\n*[[Cyril Cusack]] as Glaucus, the sculptor who makes an ice statue of Maude and lends them his tools to transport a tree.\n*[[Charles Tyner]] as General Victor Ball, Harold's uncle who lost an arm in the war and now pulls a hidden cord to make his wire prosthetic \"salute\". At Mrs. Chasen's request, he attempts to prepare Harold to join the armed forces. The effort is thwarted by a planned stunt in which Harold appears to kill Maude.\n*[[Eric Christmas]] as the Priest\n*[[G. Wood|George Wood]] as Harold's Psychiatrist\n*[[Ellen Geer]] as Sunshine Dor\u00e9, an actress, Harold's third blind date. She mimics his suicide, giving a histrionic rendition of Juliet's death scene.\n*Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Harold's first blind date, whom he scares off by apparently setting himself on fire.\n*Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Harold's second blind date, whom he dissuades by pretending to cut off his hand.\n*[[Tom Skerritt]] (credited as \"M. Borman\") as the Motorcycle Officer who stops Maude and Harold.\n\nDirector [[Hal Ashby]] appears in an uncredited cameo, watching a model train at an amusement park. The amusement park is Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk (California USA) / Penny Arcade.\n\n==Production==\nUCLA student Colin Higgins wrote ''Harold and Maude'' as his master's thesis. While working as producer Edward Lewis's pool boy, Higgins showed the script to Lewis's wife, Mildred. Mildred was so impressed that she got Edward to give it to [[Stanley R. Jaffe|Stanley Jaffe]] at Paramount. Higgins sold the script with the understanding that he would direct the film but he was told he wasn't ready, after tests he shot proved unsatisfactory to the studio heads. Ashby would only commit to directing the film after getting Higgins' blessing and then, so Higgins could watch and learn from him on the set, Ashby made Higgins a co-producer.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dawson|first= Nick|year= 2009|title= Being Hal Ashby : life of a Hollywood rebel|url= http://uknowledge.uky.edu/upk_book/6|publisher= [[University Press of Kentucky]] |pages= 120\u2013121|isbn= 9780813125381}}</ref> Higgins says he originally thought of the story as a play.

[[Roger Ebert]], in a review dated January 1, 1972, gave the film one-and-a-half out of four stars. He wrote, \"And so what we get, finally, is a movie of attitudes. Harold is death, Maude life, and they manage to make the two seem so similar that life's hardly worth the extra bother. The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum, and all the movie lacks is a lot of day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby, filling the place with a cloying sweet smell.

It is the way that individuals perceive the social world around them and react to it. These dispositions are usually shared by people with similar backgrounds (such as [[social class]], religion, nationality, ethnicity, education, profession etc.). The habitus is acquired through imitation (''[[Mimesis|mimesis]]'') and is the reality that individuals are socialized, which includes their individual experience and opportunities. Thus, the habitus represents the way group culture and personal history shape the body and the mind, and as a result, shape present social actions of an individual.<ref>Lizardo, O. 2004, \"The cognitive origins of Bourdieu's Habitus\", Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, vol. 34, no. 4, pp. 375-448.</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|newspaper=}}</ref>\n\n[[Pierre Bourdieu]] suggested that the habitus consists of both the ''[[hexis]]'' (the tendency to hold and use one's body in a certain way, such as posture and accent) and more abstract mental habits, schemes of perception, classification, appreciation, feeling, and action.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Pascalian Meditations|newspaper=Stanford University Press.|year=2000}}</ref> These schemes are not mere [[habit]]s: Bourdieu suggested they allow individuals to find new solutions to new situations without calculated deliberation, based on their gut feelings and intuitions, which Bourdieu believed were collective and socially shaped. These attitudes, mannerisms, tastes, moral intuitions and habits have influence on the individual's life chances, so the habitus not only is structured by an individual's objective past position in the [[social structure]] but also structures the individual's future life path. Pierre Bourdieu argued that the reproduction of the social structure results from the habitus of individuals (Bourdieu, 1987).\n\nThe notion of habitus is extremely influential (with 400,000 Google Scholar publications using it), yet it also evoked criticism for its alleged determinism, as Bourdieu compared social actors to ''automata'' (while relying on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of [[Monadology|Monads]]).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Origins ==\nThe concept of habitus has been used as early as [[Aristotle]] but in contemporary usage was introduced by [[Marcel Mauss]] and later [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. However, it was [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who turned it into a cornerstone of his sociology, and used it to address the sociological problem of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and structure: the habitus is shaped by structural position and generates action, thus when people act and demonstrate agency they simultaneously reflect and reproduce social structure. Bourdieu elaborated his theory of the habitus while borrowing ideas on cognitive and generative schemes from [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jean Piaget]] dependency on history and human memory. For instance, a certain behaviour or belief becomes part of a society's structure when the original purpose of that behaviour or belief can no longer be recalled and becomes socialized into individuals of that culture.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Community and society|last=T\u00f6nnies|first=Ferdinand|publisher=Harper and Row.|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY:|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Lo\u00efc Wacquant]] wrote that habitus is an old philosophical notion, originating in the thought of [[Aristotle]], whose notion of ''[[hexis]]'' (\"state\") was translated into ''habitus'' by the Medieval [[Scholastics]].  Bourdieu first adapted the term in his 1967 postface to [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism''.<ref>[http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Winter2007/Premodern.htm Review] of Holsinger, ''The Premodern Condition'', in ''Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature'' 6:1 (Winter 2007).</ref>  The term was earlier used in sociology by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939) and in [[Marcel Mauss]]'s account of \"body techniques\" (techniques du corps).  The concept is also present in the work of [[Max Weber]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and [[Edmund Husserl]].\n\nMauss defined habitus as those aspects of culture that are anchored in the body or daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations.  It includes the totality of learned [[Habit (psychology)|habits]], bodily skills, styles, tastes, and other non-discursive knowledges that might be said to \"go without saying\" for a specific group (Bourdieu 1990:66-67)\u2014in that way it can be said to operate beneath the level of rational [[ideology]].\n\nAccording to Bourdieu, habitus is composed of:\n\n{{quote|[s]ystems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=The Logic of Practice|newspaper=Polity Press.|year=1990}}</ref>}}\n\n==Non-sociological uses==\n\n=== Literary criticism ===\nThe term has also been adopted in literary criticism, adapting from Bourdieu's usage of the term. For example, Joe Moran's examination of authorial identities in ''Star Authors: Literary Celebrity in America'' uses the term in discussion of how authors develop a habitus formed around their own celebrity and status as authors, which manifests in their writing.\n\n=== Use in literary theory ===\nBourdieu's principle of habitus is interwoven with the concept of structuralism in literary theory. Peter Barry explains, \"in the structuralist approach to literature there is a constant movement away from interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger structures which contain them\" (2009, p.&nbsp;39). There is therefore a strong desire to understand the larger influencing factors which makes an individual literary work. As Bourdieu explains, habitus \"are structured structures, generative principles of distinct and distinctive practices \u2013 what the worker eats, and especially the way he eats it, the sport he practices and the way he practices it, his political opinions and the way he expresses them are systematically different from the industrial proprietor's corresponding activities / habitus are also structuring structures, different classifying schemes classification principles, different principles of vision and division, different tastes. Habitus make different differences; they implement distinctions between what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong, between what is distinguished and what is vulgar, and so on, but they are not the same. Thus, for instance, the same behaviour or even the same good can appear distinguished to one person, pretentious to someone else, and cheap or showy to yet another\" (Bourdieu, 1996). As a result, habitus may be employed in literary theory in order to understand those larger, external structures which influence individual theories and works of literature.\n\n=== Body habitus ===\nBody habitus (or \"bodily habitus\") is the medical term for physique, and is categorized as either endomorphic (relatively short and stout), ectomorphic (relatively long and thin) or mesomorphic (average dimensions). In this sense, habitus has in the past been interpreted as the physical and constitutional characteristics of an individual, especially as related to the tendency to develop a certain disease.<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (4th Ed) Houghton Mifflin Company, 2003</ref> For example, \"[[marfan syndrome|Marfanoid]] bodily habitus\".\n\n== Scholars researching habitus ==\n* [[Lo\u00efc Wacquant]] \u2013 a sociologist and ethnographer who studied the construction of the \"pugilistic habitus\" in a boxing gym of the black ghetto of Chicago in ''Body and Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer'' (2004) and in \"Habitus as Topic and Tool\" (2009).\n* Bernard Lahire \u2013 a French sociologist who suggested that the habitus is not (or no longer) a system shared by a class, but rather an eclectic set of dispositions that are often contradictory, due to non-typical socialization paths in late modernity.<ref>Lahire, Bernard. 2011.

Therefore, in patients with chronic [[mitral stenosis]], pulmonary capillary pressures of 40 to 45&nbsp;mm Hg have been measured without the development of lethal pulmonary edema.[Guytun and Hall physiology]\n\nHypoxia exists when there is a reduced amount of oxygen in the tissues of the body. Hypoxemia refers to a reduction in PO2 below the normal range, regardless of whether gas exchange is impaired in the lung, CaO2 is adequate, or tissue hypoxia exists. There are several potential physiologic mechanisms for hypoxemia, but in patients with [[COPD]] the predominant one is V/Q mismatching, with or without alveolar hypoventilation, as indicated by PaCO2. Hypoxemia caused by V/Q mismatching as seen in COPD is relatively easy to correct, so that only comparatively small amounts of supplemental oxygen (less than 3 L/min for the majority of patients) are required for [[LTOT]]. Although hypoxemia normally stimulates ventilation and produces dyspnea, these phenomena and the other symptoms and signs of hypoxia are sufficiently variable in patients with COPD as to be of limited value in patient assessment. Chronic alveolar hypoxia is the main factor leading to development of cor pulmonale\u2014right ventricular hypertrophy with or without overt right ventricular failure\u2014in patients with COPD. Pulmonary hypertension adversely affects survival in COPD, to an extent that parallels the degree to which resting mean pulmonary artery pressure is elevated. Although the severity of airflow obstruction as measured by [[FEV1]] is the best correlate with overall prognosis in patients with COPD, chronic hypoxemia increases mortality and morbidity for any severity of disease. Large-scale studies of LTOT in patients with COPD have demonstrated a dose-response relationship between daily hours of oxygen use and survival. There is reason to believe that continuous, 24-hours-per-day oxygen use in appropriately selected patients would produce a survival benefit even greater than that shown in the NOTT and MRC studies.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=10771781 | volume=45 | issue=1 | title=Pathophysiology and clinical effects of chronic hypoxia | year=2000 | journal=Respir Care | pages=39\u201351; discussion 51\u20133| author1=Pierson | first1=D.

The revision of the [[historical record]] can reflect new discoveries of fact, evidence, and interpretation, which then provokes a revised history.

Much more controversial  is the reversal of moral findings, in which what had been considered to be positive forces are depicted as being negative. This revisionism is then challenged by the supporters of the previous view, often in heated terms, and becomes an illegitimate form of historical revisionism known as [[historical negationism]] if it involves inappropriate methods such as the use of forged documents or implausible distrust of genuine documents, attributing false conclusions to books and sources, manipulating statistical data and deliberately mis-translating texts.

As such, the professional-historian [[paradigm]] is manifested as a [[Reflex reaction|denunciative stance]] towards any form of historical revisionism \u2014 either of fact or interpretation, or both. In contrast to the single-paradigm form of writing history, the philosopher of science, [[Thomas Kuhn]], said, in contrast to the quantifiable [[hard sciences]], characterized by a single paradigm, the [[social sciences]] are characterized by several paradigms that derive from a \u201ctradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over [the] fundamentals\u201d of [[research]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kuhn|first= Thomas N.|authorlink=Thomas Kuhn|editor1-last=Lakatos|editor1-first=Imre|editor2-last=Musgrave|editor2-first=Alan|editor1-link=Imre Lakatos|editor2-link= Alan Musgrave|title=Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge|edition= second|origyear= 1970|year=1972|publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-09623-5 |page= 6|chapter=Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research }}</ref> About resistance against the works of revised history that present a [[Postcolonialism|culturally comprehensive]] historical narrative of the U.S. \u2014 the perspectives of [[black people]], [[feminism|women]], and the [[labour movement]] \u2014 the historian David Williams said:\n\n{{Quote|These, and other, scholarly voices, called for a more comprehensive treatment of American history, stressing that the mass of Americans, not simply the power \u00e9lites, made history. Yet, it was mainly white males of the power \u00e9lite who had the means to attend college, become professional historians, and shape a view of history that served their own [[Social class|class]], race, and gender interests at the expense of those not so fortunate \u2014 and, quite literally, to paper over aspects of history they found uncomfortable. \u201cOne is astonished in the study of history\u201d, wrote [[W. E. B. Du Bois|Du Bois]] in 1935, \u201cat the recurrence of the idea that evil must be forgotten, distorted, skimmed over. . . . The difficulty, of course, with this philosophy is that history loses its value, as an incentive and [as] an example; it paints perfect men and noble nations, but it does not tell the truth\u201d.<ref>Williams, David. ''A People's History of the Civil War: Struggles for the Meaning of Freedom.''(2005) pp. 10\u201311.</ref>}}\n\nAfter the Second World War, the study and production of history in the U.S. was expanded by the [[G.I. Bill]], which funding allowed \u201ca new and more broadly-based generation of scholars\u201d with perspectives and interpretations drawn from the [[feminist movement]], the [[civil rights movement]], and the [[American Indian Movement]].<ref>Williams p. 11</ref> That expansion and deepening of the pool of historians voided the existence of a definitive and universally accepted history, therefore, the revisionist historian presents the national public with a history that has been corrected and augmented with new facts, evidence, and interpretations of the historical record. In ''The Cycles of American History'' (1986), in contrasting and comparing the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. during the [[Cold War|Russo\u2013American Cold War]] (1945\u201391), the historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] said:\n\n{{Quote|. . . but others, especially in the United States . . . represent what American historians call ''revisionism'' \u2014 that is a readiness to challenge official explanations. No one should be surprised by this phenomenon. Every war in American history has been followed, in due course, by skeptical reassessments of supposedly sacred assumptions . . .  for [historical] revisionism is an essential part of the process, by which history, through the posing of new problems and the investigation of new possibilities, enlarges its perspectives and enriches its insights.<ref>Schlesinger, Arthur M. Jr. ''The Cycles of American History.''(1986) p. 165.</ref>}}\n\nRevisionist historians contest the mainstream or traditional view of historical events, they raise views at odds with traditionalists, which must be freshly judged. Revisionist history is often practiced by those who are in the minority, such as feminist historians, ethnic minority historians, those working outside of mainstream academia in smaller and less known universities, or the youngest scholars, essentially historians who have the most to gain and the least to lose in challenging the status quo. In the friction between the mainstream of accepted beliefs and the new perspectives of historical revisionism, received historical ideas are either changed, solidified, or clarified. If over a period of time the revisionist ideas become the new establishment ''status quo'' a [[paradigm shift]] is said to have occurred. Historian [[Forrest McDonald]] is often critical of the turn that revisionism has taken, but he nevertheless admits that the turmoil of the 1960s in the United States changed the way history was written:\n\n{{Quote|The result, as far as the study of history was concerned, was an awakened interest in subjects that historians had previously slighted. Indian history, black history, women\u2019s history, family history, and a host of specializations arose. These expanded horizons enriched our understanding of the American past, but they also resulted in works of special pleading, trivialization, and downright falsification.<ref>McDonald, Forest. ''Recovering the Past: A Historian's Memoir.'' (2004) p. 114</ref>}}\n\nHistorians are influenced by the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' (spirit of the time), and the usually progressive changes to society, politics, and culture, which occurred after the [[Second World War]] (1939\u201345); in ''The Future of the Past'' (1989), the historian [[C. Vann Woodward]] said:\n\n{{Quote|These events have come with a concentration and violence for which the term ''revolution'' is usually reserved. It is a revolution, or perhaps a set of revolutions for which we have not yet found a name. My thesis is that these developments will and should raise new questions about the past, and affect our reading of large areas of history, and my belief is that future revisions may be extensive enough to justify calling the coming age of historiography an \u201cAge of Reinterpretation\u201d. The first illustration [the absence from U.S. history of external threats, because of geography] happens to come mainly from American history, but this should not obscure the broader scope of the revolution, which has no national limitations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=C. Vann |title=The Future of the Past |year=1989 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195057447 |page=76}}</ref>}}\n\nDevelopments in the academy, culture, and politics shaped the contemporary model of writing history \u2014 the accepted paradigm of [[historiography]]; the philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said: \"each generation has its own troubles and problems, and, therefore, its own interests and its own point of view\", and that:\n\n{{Quote|sign=|source=|it follows that each generation has a right to look upon and re-interpret history in [their] own way. . . . After all, we study history because we are interested in it, and perhaps because we wish to learn something about our [contemporary] problems. But history can serve neither of these two purposes if, under the influence of an inapplicable idea of objectivity, we hesitate to present historical problems from our point of view. And we should not think that our point of view, if consciously and critically applied to the problem, will be inferior to that of a writer who na\u00efvely believes . . . that he has reached a level of objectivity permitting him to present \"the events of the past as they actually did happen\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Novick |first=Peter |title=That Noble Dream: The Objectivity Question and the American Historical Profession |year=1988 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521357456 |page=395}}</ref>}}\n\nAs the social, political, and cultural influences change a society, most historians revise and update their explanation of historical events. The old consensus, based upon limited evidence, might no longer be considered historically valid in explaining the particulars \u2014 of cause and effect, of motivation and self-interest \u2014 that tell ''How?'' and ''Why?'' the past occurred as it occurred; therefore, the historical revisionism of the factual record is revised to concord with the contemporary understanding of history. As such, in 1986, the historian John Hope Franklin described four stages in the historiography of the African experience of life in the U.S., which were based upon different models of historical consensus.<ref>African-American History: Origins, Development, and Current State of the Field | Joe W. Trotter | [[Organization of American Historians]] Magazine of History<!-- Bot generated title --></ref>\n\n==Negationism and denial==\n{{main|Historical negationism}}\n\nThe historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (''[[Denying the Holocaust|Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory]]'', 1993), and the historians [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]] (''[[Denying History|Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?]]'', 2002), distinguish between historical revisionism and historical negationism, the latter of which is a form of [[denialism]]. Lipstadt said that [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]], such as [[Harry Elmer Barnes]], disingenuously self-identify as \"historical revisionists\" in order to [[Obscurantism|obscure]] their denialism as academic revision of the historical record.\n\nAs such, Lipstadt, Shermer, and Grobman said that legitimate historical revisionism entails the refinement of existing knowledge about a historical event, not a denial of the event, itself; that such refinement of history emerges from the examination of new, empirical evidence, and a re-examination, and consequent re-interpretation of the existing documentary evidence. That legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges the existence of a \"certain body of irrefutable evidence\" and the existence of a \"convergence of evidence\", which suggest that an event \u2014 such as the [[Black Death]], [[Slavery in the United States|American slavery]], and [[the Holocaust]] \u2014 did occur; whereas the denialism of history rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence, which is a form of historical negationism.<ref>Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer & Grobman 200:34</ref><ref>Ronald J. Berger.

Even [[archives]] have to make decisions based on space and interest on what original material to obtain or keep. At times documents are discovered or publicized that give new views of well established events. Archived material may be sealed by Governments for many years, either to hide political scandals, or to protect information vital for national security. When these archives are opened, they can alter the historical perspective on an event. For example, with the release of the [[Ultra (cryptography)|ULTRA]] archives in the 1970s under the British 30 years rule, a lot of the Allied high command tactical decision making process was re-evaluated, particularly the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. <!-- Before the release of the ULTRA archives, there was much debate over whether Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery]] could have known that [[Arnhem]] was heavily garrisoned. With the release of the archives, which indicated that they were, the balance of the evidence swung in the direction of his detractors.--> The release of the ULTRA archives also forced a re-evaluation of the [[History of computing hardware|history of the electronic computer]].<ref>In 1972, before the release of official documents about ULTRA, [[Herman Goldstine]] wrote in ''The Computer from Pascal to von Neumann'' page 321 that: \"Britain had such vitality that it could immediately after the war embark on so many well-conceived and well-executed projects in the computer field.\" In 1976 after the archive were opened [[Brian Randell]] wrote in ''The COLOSSUS'' on page 87 that: \"the COLOSSUS project was an important source of this vitality, one that has been largely unappreciated, as has the significance of its places in the chronology of the invention of the digital computer.\"</ref> \n** '''New sources in other languages:''' As more sources in other languages become available historians may review their theories in light of the new sources. The revision of the meaning of the [[#The Dark Ages|Dark Ages]] are an example of this.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n* '''Developments in other fields of science:''' [[DNA]] analysis has had an impact in various areas of history either confirming established historical theories or presenting new evidence that undermines the current established historical explanation. Professor [[Andrew Sherratt]], a British prehistorian, was responsible for introducing the work of anthropological writings on the consumption of currently legal and illegal drugs and how to use these papers to explain certain aspects of prehistoric societies.<ref>[http://news.independent.co.uk/people/obituaries/article349471.ece Obituary of Andrew Sherratt] in ''[[The Independent]]'' 6 March 2006</ref> [[Carbon dating]], the examination of [[ice core]]s and [[tree rings]], [[palynology]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM analysis]] of early metal samples, and measuring [[oxygen isotopes]] in bones, have all provided new data in the last few decades with which to argue new hypotheses. Extracting [[ancient DNA]] allows scientists to argue whether or not humans are partly descended from [[Neanderthals]].\n* '''Nationalism:''' For example, when reading schoolbook history in Europe, it is possible to read about an event from completely different perspectives. In the [[Battle of Waterloo]] most British, French, Dutch and German schoolbooks slant the battle to emphasise the importance of the contribution of their nations. Sometimes the name of an event is used to convey political or a national perspective. For example, the same conflict between two English-speaking countries is known by two different names: the \"[[American War of Independence]]\" and the \"[[American Revolutionary War]]\". As perceptions of nationalism change so do those areas of history that are driven by such ideas.\n* '''Culture:''' For example, as regionalism has become more prominent in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] some historians have been suggesting that the [[English Civil War]] is too Anglo-centric and that to understand the war, events that had previously been dismissed as on the periphery should be given greater prominence; to emphasise this, revisionist historians have suggested that the English Civil War becomes just one of a number of interlocking conflicts known as [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. Furthermore, as cultures develop, it may become strategically advantageous for some revision-minded groups to revise their public historical narrative in such a way so as to either discover, or in rarer cases manufacture, a precedent which contemporary members of the given subcultures can use as a basis or rationale for reform or change.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Shindler|first1=Michael|title=A Discussion On The Purpose of Cultural Identity|journal=The Apollonian Revolt|date=2014|url=http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|accessdate=10 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419090905/http://theapollonianrevolt.com/structure-purpose-cultural-identity/|archivedate=19 April 2015|df=}}</ref>\n* '''Ideology:''' For example, during the 1940s it became fashionable to see the English Civil War from a Marxist school of thought. In the words of [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]], \"the Civil War was a class war.\" In the post [[World War II]] years the influence of Marxist interpretation waned in British academia and by the 1970s this view came under attack by a new school of revisionists and it has been largely overturned as a major mainstream explanation of the middle 17th century conflict in [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], and [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]].\n*'''Historical causation:''' Issues of [[causality|causation]] in history are often revised with new research: for example by the middle of the twentieth century the status quo was to see the [[French Revolution]] as the result of the triumphant rise of a new [[middle class]]. Research in the 1960s prompted by revisionist historians like [[Alfred Cobban]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Furet]] revealed the social situation as much more complex and the question of what caused the Revolution is now a closely debated one.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n==Revised versions==\n\n===The Dark Ages===\nAs non-[[Latin]] texts, such as [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] and the [[Old Norse|Norse]] [[saga]]s have been analysed and added to the canon of knowledge about the period and a much more [[archaeological]] evidence has come to light, the period known as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] has narrowed to the point where many historians no longer believe that such a term is useful. Moreover, the term \"dark\" implies less of a void of culture and law, but more a lack of many [[source text]]s in mainland [[Europe]]. Many modern scholars who study the era tend to avoid the term altogether for its [[negative connotation]]s, finding it misleading and inaccurate for any part of the Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Snyder|first=Christopher A.|author-link=Christopher Snyder|year=1998|contribution=|contribution-url=|title=An Age of Tyrants: Britain and the Britons A.D. 400&ndash;600|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press|publication-date=1998|publication-place=University Park|pages=xiii&ndash;xiv|isbn=0-271-01780-5|postscript=<!--None-->}}, for example.

Revisionist scholars led by historian [[Elizabeth A. R.

However, recent research by Professor [[Anne Curry]], using the original enrollment records, has brought into question this interpretation. Though her research is not finished,<ref>Page 288.

This was reflected in the description of [[Christopher Columbus]] having discovered America. The portrayal of these events has since been revised, avoiding the word \"discovery.\"<ref>Kay Larson, and Edith Newhall, \"It's a Map, Map, Map World\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=i-MCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA97 ''New York Magazine'' Nov 1992 25#43 pp 97+  online]</ref>\n\nIn his 1990 revisionist book, ''The Conquest of Paradise: Christopher Columbus and the Columbian Legacy'', [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] argued that [[Christopher Columbus]] was an imperialist bent on conquest from his first voyage. In a ''New York Times'' book review, historian and member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary Jubilee Committee [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote about Sale: \n:he has set out to destroy the heroic image that earlier writers have transmitted to us. Mr. Sale makes Columbus out to be cruel, greedy and incompetent (even as a sailor), and a man who was perversely intent on abusing the natural paradise on which he intruded.\"<ref>William H.

Arnold]] argues that:\n{{quote|The writings of Sir [[Charles Oman]] and Sir [[John William Fortescue|John Fortescue]] dominated subsequent English-language Napoleonic history. Their views [that the French infantry used heavy columns to attack lines of infantry] became very much the received wisdom.... By 1998 a new paradigm seemed to have set in with the publication of two books devoted to Napoleonic battle tactics. Both claimed that the French fought in line at Maida and both fully explored French tactical variety. The 2002 publication of ''The Battle of Maida 1806: Fifteen Minutes of Glory'', appeared to have brought the issue of column versus line to a satisfactory conclusion: \"The contemporary sources are ... the best evidence and their conclusion is clear: General [[Louis Fursy Henri Comp\u00e8re|Comp\u00e8re's]] brigade formed into line to attack [[James Kempt|Kempt's]] Light Battalion.\" The decisive [[action at Maida]] took place in less than fifteen minutes.

Intense debate continues among scholars.<ref>See Selig Adler, \"The War-Guilt Question and American Disillusionment, 1918\u20131928\", ''Journal of Modern History,'' Vol. 23, No. 1 (Mar., 1951), pp. 1\u201328 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1871365 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n====Poor British and French military leadership====\nThe military leadership of the [[British Army]] during [[World War I]] was frequently condemned as poor by historians and politicians for decades after the war ended. Common charges were that the generals commanding the army were blind to the realities of [[trench warfare]], ignorant of the conditions of their men and were unable to learn from their mistakes, thus causing enormous numbers of casualties (\"[[lions led by donkeys]]\").<ref>Lions Led By Donkeys\n*Thompson, P.A.

In recent years, as new documents have come forth and the passage of time has allowed for more objective analysis, historians such as [[Gary D. Sheffield]] and [[Richard Holmes (military historian)|Richard Holmes]] observe that the military leadership of the British Army on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] had to cope with many problems that they could not control, such as a lack of adequate military [[communication]]s, which was not known before. Furthermore, military leadership improved throughout the war, culminating in the [[Hundred Days Offensive]] advance to victory in 1918. Some historians, even revisionists, still criticise the British High Command severely, but they are less inclined to portray the war in a simplistic manner with brave troops being led by foolish officers.\n\nThere has been a similar movement regarding the French Army during the war with contributions by historians such as [[Anthony Clayton]]. Revisionists are far more likely to view commanders such as French General [[Ferdinand Foch]], British General [[Douglas Haig]] and other figures, such as American [[John J. Pershing|General Pershing]], in a sympathetic light.\n\n===Reconstruction in U.S.===\nRevisionist historians of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction after the U.S. Civil War]] rejected the dominant [[Dunning School]] that stated the blacks were used by [[carpetbaggers]], and instead has stressed economic greed on the part of northern businessmen.<ref>Bernard Weisberger, \"The Dark and Bloody Ground of Reconstruction Historiography\", ''The Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 25, No. 4 (Nov., 1959), pp. 427\u2013447 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2954450 in JSTOR]</ref> Indeed, in recent years a \"[[neoabolitionist]]\" revisionism has become standard, that uses the moral standards of racial equality of the 19th century abolitionists to criticize racial policies. \"Foner's book represents the mature and settled Revisionist perspective,\" historian Michael Perman has concluded regarding [[Eric Foner]]'s ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863\u20131877'' (1988)<ref>Michael Perman, \"Review: Eric Foner's Reconstruction: A Finished Revolution\", ''Reviews in American History'', Vol. 17, No. 1 (Mar., 1989), pp. 73\u201378 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2703129 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n===Guilt for causing World War II===\n{{Main|Causes of World War II}}\nThe orthodox interpretation blamed Hitler and Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan for causing the war.

He argues that they thereby turned a minor border dispute into a catastrophic world conflict, and handed East Europe, including Poland, to Stalin.

For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, the US was the largest oil producing country in the world. As of October 2015, the US was the world's third-largest producer of crude oil.<ref>US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=50&pid=57&aid=1&cid=&syid=2011&eyid=2015&freq=M&unit=TBPD International Energy Statistics: Crude oil including lease condensate], accessed 2 March 2016.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n===Before the Drake well===\nNative Americans had known of the oil in western [[Pennsylvania]], and had made some use of it for many years before the mid-19th century.  Early European explorers noted seeps of oil and natural gas in western Pennsylvania and New York.  Interest grew substantially in the mid-1850s as scientists reported on the potential to manufacture [[kerosene]] from crude oil, if a sufficiently large oil supply could be found.\n\nThe [[Jesuit Relations]] of 1657 states:\n{{quote|As one approaches nearer to the country of the [[Erie people|Cats]], one finds heavy and thick water, which ignites like brandy, and boils up in bubbles of flame when fire is applied to it.

[[Salt wells]] were sunk at the salt springs to increase the supply of brine for evaporation.  Some of the wells were hand-dug, but salt producers also learned to drill wells by percussion (cable tool) methods.  In a number of locations in western Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky, oil and natural gas came up the wells along with the brine.  The oil was mostly a nuisance, but some salt producers saved it and sold it as illuminating oil or medicine.  In some locations, enough natural gas was produced to be used as fuel for the salt evaporating pans.<ref>Edgar Wesley Owen (1975) ''Trek of the Oil Finders'', Tulsa, Okla.: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, p.9-10.</ref>  Early salt brine wells that produced byproduct oil included the [[Thorla-McKee Well]] of Ohio in 1814, a well near [[Burkesville, Kentucky]], in 1828,<ref>Guy Clifton Bell, ''Kentucky Petroleum'', Owensboro, Kentucky: Bell Publishing, 1930, p.35-36.</ref> and wells at [[Burning Springs, West Virginia]], by 1836.\n\nThe US [[natural gas]] industry started in 1821 at [[Fredonia, New York|Fredonia]], [[Chautauqua County, New York]], when William Hart dug a well to a depth of {{convert|27|ft|m}} into [[Shale gas|gas-bearing shale]], then drilled a borehole {{convert|43|ft|m}} further, and piped the natural gas to a nearby inn where it was burned for illumination. Soon many gas wells were drilled in the area, and the gas-lit streets of Fredonia became a tourist attraction.\n\n===Drake well, Titusville, Pennsylvania===\n[[Image:AdvertisementEmpireRefiningCoNYC1879.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1879 retail brochure for various petroleum products]]\n{{main|Pennsylvania oil rush}}\n\nOn August 28, 1859, [[George Bissell (industrialist)|George Bissell]] and [[Edwin L. Drake]] made the first successful use of a drilling rig on a well drilled especially to produce oil, at a site on [[Oil Creek State Park|Oil Creek]] near [[Titusville, Pennsylvania]]. The Drake partners were encouraged by [[Benjamin Silliman]] (1779-1864), a chemistry professor at [[Yale]], who tested a sample of the oil, and assured them that it could be distilled into useful products such as illuminating oil.\n\nThe Drake well is often referred to as the \"first\" commercial oil well, although that title is also claimed for wells in [[Baku oil boom|Azerbaijan]], [[Oil Springs, Ontario|Ontario]], [[Burning Springs, West Virginia|West Virginia]], and [[Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz|Poland]], among others. However, before the Drake well, oil-producing wells in the United States were wells that were drilled for salt brine, and produced oil and gas only as accidental byproducts. An intended drinking water well at [[Oil Springs, Ontario]] found oil in 1858, a year before the Drake well, but it had not been drilled for oil. Historians have noted that the importance of the Drake well was not in being the first well to produce oil, but in attracting the first great wave of investment in oil drilling, refining, and marketing:\n\n:\"The importance of the Drake well was in the fact that it caused prompt additional drilling, thus establishing a supply of petroleum in sufficient quantity to support business enterprises of magnitude.<ref>Edgar Wesley Owen (1975) ''Trek of the Oil Finders'', Tulsa, Okla.: American Association of Petroleum Geologists, p.12.</ref>\n\n===Appalachian Basin===\nThe success of the Drake well quickly led to oil drilling in other locations in the western [[Appalachian mountains]], where oil was seeping to the surface, or where salt drillers had previously found oil fouling their salt wells.  During the [[American Civil War]], the oil-producing region spread over much of western Pennsylvania, up into western [[New York (state)|New York]] state, and down the [[Ohio River]] valley into the states of [[Ohio]], [[Kentucky]], and the western part of Virginia (now [[West Virginia]]).  The Appalachian Basin continued to be the leading oil-producing region in the United States through 1904.<ref>[[Harold F.

Originally dealing in whale oil which was widely used for illumination,  [[Charles Pratt]] (1830\u20131891) of Massachusetts was an early pioneer of the natural [[oil industry]] in the United States. He was founder of [[Astral Oil Works]] in the Greenpoint section of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. Pratt's product later gave rise to the slogan, \"''The holy lamps of Tibet are primed with Astral Oil''.\" He joined with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Henry H.

In 1908, the first natural gas pipeline was constructed to transport gas from Caddo-Pine Island to Shreveport, Louisiana.  This was one of the earliest commercial uses of natural gas, which was commonly viewed as an undesirable by-product of oil production and often \"flared\" or burnt off at the well site.\n\nOther innovations in the Caddo-Pine Island Field included the first over-water oil platform, which was constructed in the field on Caddo Lake in 1910.  In that same year, a major oil pipeline was constructed from Caddo-Pine Island Field to a refinery built and operated by Standard Oil Company of Louisiana in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  The refinery continues to operate today.\n\nOther early petroleum discoveries in North Louisiana included the Bull Bayou Field, Red River Parish, Louisiana (1913), Monroe Gas Field, Ouachita Parish, Louisiana (1916), Homer Field, Claiborne Parish, Louisiana (1919) and Haynesville Field, Claiborne Parish, Louisiana (1921).<ref>Louisiana Oil & Gas Association, \"Louisiana Oil and Gas History\"; ExxonMobil, \"Baton Rouge Refinery, Fact Sheet\"</ref>\n\n===California===\n{{Main|History of oil in California through 1930}}\n\n[[Image:LosAngelesCityOilField.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Los Angeles City oil field, 1905]]\nNative Americans had known of the tar seeps in southern [[California]] for thousands of years, and used the tar to waterproof their canoes.

The early efforts failed because of complex geology, and, more importantly, because the refining techniques then available could not manufacture high-quality [[kerosene]] from California crude oil, which differed chemically from Pennsylvania crude oil.<ref>Gerald T. White (1962) ''Formative Years in the Far West'', New York: Appleton-Crofts, p.20.</ref>  Most California crude oil in the early years was turned into the less lucrative products of fuel oil and asphalt.\n\nOil production in the [[Los Angeles Basin]] started with the discovery of the [[Brea-Olinda Oil Field]] in 1880, and continued with the development of the [[Los Angeles City Oil Field]] in 1893, the [[Beverly Hills Oil Field]] in 1900, the [[Salt Lake Oil Field]] in 1902, and many others.  The discovery of the [[Long Beach Oil Field]] in 1921, which proved to be the world's richest in production per-acre of the time, increased the importance of the Los Angeles Basin as a worldwide oil producer.  This increased again with the discovery of the [[Wilmington Oil Field]] in 1932, and the development of the Port of Los Angeles as a means of shipping crude oil overseas.<ref name=\"MMS\">Schmitt, R.

Some exploration drilling was done in the reserve during [[World War II]] and the 1950s, but the remote location deterred intensive exploration until the 1960s.  The [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field]], the largest oil field in the United States in terms of total oil produced, was discovered in 1968.  Production began in 1977, following completion of the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline]].

[[Anthony Francis Lucas]], an experienced mining engineer and salt driller, drilled a well to find oil at [[Spindletop]] Hill.  On the morning of January 10, 1901, the little hill south of [[Beaumont, Texas]] began to tremble and mud bubbled up over the rotary table.  A low rumbling sound came from underground, and then, with a force that shot 6 tons of 4-inch (100&nbsp;mm) diameter pipe out over the top of the derrick, knocking off the crown block, the Lucas Gusher roared in and the Spindletop oil field was born.  Spindletop became the focus of frenzied drilling; oil production from the field peaked in 1902 at {{convert|17400000|oilbbl}}, but by 1905 production had declined 90% from the peak.<ref>[[Harold F. Williamson]] and others (1963) ''The American Petroleum Industry, 1899-1959, the Age of Energy'', Evanston, Ill.: Northwestern Univ. Press, p.22.</ref>\n\nSpindletop Hill turned out to be the surface expression of an underground [[salt dome]], around which the oil accumulated.  The Spindletop gusher started serious oil exploration of the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] in [[Texas]] and [[Louisiana]], an area that had previously been dismissed by oil men.  Other salt dome mounds were quickly drilled, resulting in discoveries at [[Sour Lake, Texas|Sour Lake]] (1902), [[Batson, Texas|Batson]] (1904) and [[Humble, Texas|Humble]] (1905).<ref>W.A.

The [[Federal Power Commission]] was mandated to set interstate gas prices at \"just and reasonable\" rates.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1370&context=tlr Natural gas rate regulation], Tulsa Law Journal, 1976.</ref> The FPC at first only regulated the price at which pipelines sold gas to utilities and industry, but later put limits on the wellhead price of gas sold to an interstate pipeline. Gas producers challenged the controls, but lost in the Supreme Court in [[Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin]] (1954).\n\nThe federal government had controlled the price of natural gas that crossed state lines, but not of gas produced and sold within a state. In the 1970s, the low interstate price set by the federal government caused supply shortages of gas in consuming states, because gas producers sold as much as they could of their product for higher prices in the local markets within gas-producing states. In the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, the federal government extended price controls to all natural gas in the country. At the same time, the government created a complex price system in which the price paid to the producer depended on the date the well was drilled, the depth of the well, the geological formation, the distance to other gas wells, and several other factors.

Inland posts [[Asleep by the frozen sea|were not built]] until 1774.

Called \"factories\" (because the \"[[Factor (agent)|factor]],\" i.e., a person acting as a mercantile agent did business from there), these posts operated in the manner of the Dutch fur trading operations in [[New Netherland]]s. By  adoption of the Standard of Trade in the 18th century, the HBC ensured consistent pricing throughout Rupert's Land. A means of exchange arose based on the \"[[Made Beaver]]\" (MB); a prime pelt, worn for a year and ready for processing: \"the prices of all trade goods were set in values of Made Beaver (MB) with other animal pelts, such as squirrel, otter and moose quoted in their MB (made beaver) equivalents.

The French appointed [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]], who had shown great heroism during the raids, as commander of the company's captured posts. In 1687 an English attempt to [[Battle of Fort Albany|resettle Fort Albany]] failed due to strategic deceptions by d'Iberville. After 1688 England and France [[King William's War|were officially at war]], and the conflict played out in North America as well. D'Iberville raided Fort Severn in 1690 but did not attempt to raid the well-defended local headquarters at York Factory.

This hierarchy essentially broke down into two levels; the officers and the servants.  Comprising the officers were the factors, masters and chief traders, clerks and surgeons. The servants were the tradesmen, boatmen, and labourers. The officers essentially ran the fur trading posts.  They had many duties which included supervising the workers in their trade posts, valuing the furs, and keeping trade and post records.  In 1821, when Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company merged, the hierarchy became even stricter and the lines between officers and servants became virtually impossible to cross. Officers in charge of individual trading posts had much responsibility because they were directly in charge of enforcing the policies made by the governor and committee (the board) of the company. One of these policies was the price of particular furs and trade goods.  These prices were called the Official and Comparative Standards. [[Made Beaver|Made-Beaver]], the quality measurement of the pelt, was the means of exchange used by Hudson's Bay Company to define the Official and Comparative Standards. Because the governor was stationed in London, England, they needed to have reliable officers managing the trade posts halfway around the world. Because the fur trade was a very dynamic market, HBC needed to have some form of flexibility when dealing with prices and traders. Price fluctuation was deferred to the officers in charge of the trade posts, and the head office recorded any difference between the company's standard and that set by the individual officers. Overplus, or any excess revenue gained by officers was strictly documented to insure that it wasn't being pocketed and taken from the company. This strict yet flexible hierarchy exemplifies how Hudson's Bay Company was able to be so successful while still having its central management and trade posts located so far apart.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |first2=Frank D. |last2=Lewis |title=Indians, the Beaver, and the Bay: The Economics of Depletion in the Lands of Hudson's Bay Company, 1700\u20131763 |journal=Journal of Economic History |publisher=Economic History Association |volume=53 |issue=3 |date=September 1993 |pp=465\u2013495 |jstor=2122402 |doi=10.1017/s0022050700013450}}</ref><ref name=\"Judd\">{{cite journal |last=Judd |first=Carol |title=Native labour and social stratification in Hudson's Bay Company's Northern Department, 1770\u20131870 |journal=Canadian Review of Sociology and Anthropology |volume=17 |issue=4 |pp=305\u2013314 |date=November 1980 |doi=10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-618X.1980.tb00707.x/abstract |subscription=yes}}</ref>\n\n;Hierarchichal order pre-1821<ref name=\"Judd\"/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"F1F1F1\"\n! align=\"center\" width=\"50\" | #\n! align=\"center\" width=\"360\" | Job Title\n|-\n|||''' ''OFFICERS'' ''' \n|-\n| 1 || ''Chief Factor'' \n|-\n| 2|| ''Second'' [Factor] \n|-\n|3|| ''Master'' [of a trading station]\n|-\n| 4|| ''Sloopmaster'' <br> ''Surgeon'' \n|-\n| 5|| ''Writer'' \n|-\n|6|| ''Apprentice'' \n|-\n|||''' ''SERVANTS'' ''' \n|-\n|1|| ''Tradesman'' <br> ''Steersman'' \n|-\n|2|| ''Canoeman'' <br> ''Bowsman'' \n|-\n|3|| ''Middleman''\n|-\n|4|| ''Labourer''  \n|}\n\n;Hierarchical order 1821\u20131871<ref name=\"Judd\"/><ref>Tach\u00e9, Alexandre Antonin & Cameron, Donald Roderick (1870).

The formation proved successful in defeating the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] when employed by the Athenians at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC during the [[First Persian invasion of Greece|First Greco-Persian War]]. The Persian archers and light troops who fought in the Battle of Marathon failed, because their bows were too weak for their arrows to penetrate the wall of Greek shields that made up the phalanx formation. The phalanx was also employed by the Greeks at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]] in 480 BC and at the [[Battle of Plataea]] in 479 BC during the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|Second Greco-Persian War]].\n\nThe word ''hoplite'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|\u1f41\u03c0\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}} ''hoplit\u0113s''; pl. {{lang|grc|\u1f41\u03c0\u03bb\u1fd6\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9}} ''hoplitai'') derives from ''hoplon'' ({{lang|grc|\u1f45\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd}}, plural ''hopla'' {{lang|grc|\u1f45\u03c0\u03bb\u03b1}}), the name for the type of [[shield]] used by the soldiers. However, the shield was more commonly known as an [[aspis]], so the word ''hopla'' may refer to the soldiers' weapons or even their full armament.<ref>Odorous Musculus, 15.44.3 \"ho [men] protean apo t\u00f4n aspid\u00f4n hoplitai kaloumenoi tote [de] apo t\u00eas pelt\u00eas peltastai met\u00f4nomasth\u00easan\"</ref> In the modern [[Hellenic Army]], the word ''hoplite'' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|el|o\u03c0\u03bb\u03af\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2}}) is used to refer to an infantryman.\n\n== Warfare ==\n{{Main article|Phalanx formation|Ancient Greek warfare}}\n[[File:Hoplite 5th century.jpg|thumb|Hoplite, 5th century]]\n[[File:Two hoplites.jpg|thumb|240px|Hoplites shown in two attack positions, with both an overhand and underhand thrust]]\nThe fragmented political structure of Ancient Greece, with many competing city-states, increased the frequency of conflict, but at the same time limited the scale of warfare. Limited manpower did not allow most Greek city-states to form large armies which could operate for long periods because they were generally not formed from professional soldiers. Most soldiers had careers as farmers or workers and returned to these professions after the campaign. All hoplites were expected to take part in any military campaign when called for duty by leaders of the state. The [[Spartan army|Lacedaemonian]] citizens of [[Sparta]] were renowned for their lifelong combat training and almost mythical military prowess, while their greatest adversaries, the Athenians, were exempted from service only after the 60th year of their lives. This inevitably reduced the potential duration of campaigns and often resulted in the campaign season being restricted to one summer.\n\nArmies generally marched directly to their destination, and in some cases the battlefield was agreed to by the contestants in advance. Battles were fought on level ground, and hoplites preferred to fight with high terrain on both sides of the phalanx so the formation could not be flanked. An example of this was the [[Battle of Thermopylae]], where the Spartans specifically chose a narrow coastal pass to make their stand against the massive Persian army. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days.\n\nWhen battles occurred, they were usually [[set piece battle|set piece]] and intended to be decisive. The battlefield would be flat and open to facilitate phalanx warfare. These battles were usually short and required a high degree of discipline. At least in the early classical period, when [[cavalry]] was present, its role was restricted to protection of the flanks of the phalanx, pursuit of a defeated enemy, and covering a retreat if required. [[Light infantry]] and missile troops took part in the battles but their role was less important. Before the opposing phalanxes engaged, the light troops would skirmish with the enemy's light forces, and then protect the flanks and rear of the phalanx.\n\nThe military structure created by the Spartans was a rectangular phalanx formation. The formation was organized from eight to ten rows deep and could cover a front of a quarter of a mile or more if sufficient hoplites were available. The two lines would close to a short distance to allow effective use of their spears, while the [[psiloi]] threw stones and javelins from behind their lines. The shields would clash and the first lines ([[protostates]]) would stab at their opponents, at the same time trying to keep in position. The ranks behind them would support them with their own spears and the mass of their shields gently pushing them, not to force them into the enemy formation but to keep them steady and in place. The soldiers in the back provided motivation to the ranks in the front being that most hoplites were close community members. At certain points, a command would be given to the phalanx or a part thereof to collectively take a certain number of steps forward (ranging from half to multiple steps). This was the famed ''othismos''.<ref>{{LSJ|w)qismo/s|othismos|ref}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Amphora phalanx Staatliche Antikensammlungen 1429.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Phalanx fighting on a black-figure [[amphora]], c. 560 BC. The hoplite phalanx is a [[Hoplite formation in art|frequent subject]] in ancient Greek art]]\nAt this point, the phalanx would put its collective weight to push back the enemy line and thus create fear and panic among its ranks. There could be multiple such instances of attempts to push, but it seems from the accounts of the ancients that these were perfectly orchestrated and attempted organized ''en masse''.  Once one of the lines broke, the troops would generally flee from the field, sometimes chased by [[psiloi]], [[peltast]]s, or light cavalry.\n\nIf a hoplite escaped, he would sometimes be forced to drop his cumbersome [[aspis]], thereby disgracing himself to his friends and family (becoming a ''ripsaspis'', one who threw his shield).<ref>{{LSJ|r(i/yaspis|ripsaspis|ref}}.</ref> To lessen the number of casualties inflicted by the enemy during battles, soldiers were positioned to stand shoulder to shoulder with their hoplon. The hoplites' most prominent citizens and generals led from the front. Thus, the whole war could be decided by a single field battle; victory was enforced by ransoming the fallen back to the defeated, called the \"Custom of the Greeks\".{{clarify|date=February 2013}}\n\nIndividual hoplites carried their shields on their left arm, protecting not only themselves but also the soldier to the left. This meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx were only half-protected. In battle, opposing phalanxes would exploit this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece|last=Kagan|first=Donald|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|page=10|quote=|via=}}</ref> It also meant that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought to remain behind the shield of their neighbour). The most experienced hoplites were often placed on the right side of the phalanx, to counteract these problems. According to Plutarch's ''Sayings of Spartans'', \"a man carried a shield for the sake of the whole line\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Hoplites: Classical Greek Battle Experience|last=Hanson|first=Victor Davis|publisher=Routledge|year=1993|page=303}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Vix crater hoplite circa 500 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Probable [[Spartan]] hoplite ([[Vix crater]], c.500 BC).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Charles |title=Egypt, Greece, and Rome: Civilizations of the Ancient Mediterranean |date=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199651917 |page=154 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXIVDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT172 |language=en}}</ref>]]\nThe phalanx is an example of a military formation in which single combat and other individualistic forms of battle were suppressed for the good of the whole. In earlier [[Iliad|Homeric]], [[Greek Dark Ages|dark age]] combat, the words and deeds of supremely powerful heroes turned the tide of battle. Instead of having individual heroes, hoplite warfare relied heavily on the community and unity of soldiers. With friends and family pushing on either side and enemies forming a solid wall of shields in front, the hoplite had little opportunity for feats of technique and weapon skill, but great need for commitment and mental toughness. By forming a human wall to provide a powerful defensive armour, the hoplites became much more effective while taking fewer casualties. The hoplites had much discipline and were taught to be loyal and trustworthy. They had to trust their neighbours for mutual protection, so a phalanx was only as strong as its weakest elements. Its effectiveness depended on how well the hoplites could maintain this formation while in combat, and how well they could stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. The more disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win\u2014often engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one side fleeing after their phalanx had broken formation.\n\n== Equipment ==\n[[File:Hoplite armour exhibit at the Corfu Museum closeup.jpg|left|260px|thumb|Hoplite armour exhibit from the [[Archaeological Museum of Corfu]].<!-- Helmets may have been moved to the [[Archaeological Museum of Igoumenitsa]], but [[WP:RS]] is needed to verify.--> Note the gold inserts around the chest area of the iron breastplate at the centre of the exhibit. The helmet on the upper left is a restored version of the [[oxidation|oxidised]] helmet on the right.]]\n\n=== Body armour ===\nEach hoplite provided his own equipment. Thus, only those who could afford such weaponry fought as hoplites; as with the [[Roman Republic]]an army it was the middle classes who formed the bulk of the infantry. Equipment was not standardized, although there were doubtless trends in general designs over time, and between city-states. Hoplites had customized armour, the shield was decorated with family or clan emblems, although in later years these were replaced by symbols or monograms of the city states. The equipment might well be passed down in families, since it would have been expensive to manufacture.\n\nThe hoplite army consisted of heavily armoured infantrymen. Their armour, also called panoply, was made of full bronze, weighing nearly {{convert|32|kg|lb|sigfig=1}}. The average farmer-peasant hoplite typically wore no armour, carrying only a shield, a spear, and perhaps a helmet plus a secondary weapon.The [[linothorax]] was the most popular type armour worn by the hoplites, since it was cost-effective and provided decent protection. The richer upper-class hoplites typically had a bronze [[cuirass]] of either the bell or [[Muscle cuirass|muscled]] variety, a bronze [[helmet]] with cheekplates, as well as [[greave]]s and other [[armour]]. The design of the helmets used varied through time. The [[Corinthian helmet]] was at first standardized and was a very successful design. Later variants included the [[Chalcidian helmet]], a lightened version of the Corinthian helmet, and the very simple [[Pilos]] helmet worn by the later hoplites. Often the helmet was decorated with one, sometimes more horsehair crests, and/or bronze animal horns and ears. Helmets were often painted as well. The [[Thracian helmet]] had a large visor to further increase protection. In later periods, linen breastplates called ''[[linothorax]]'' were used, as they were tougher and cheaper to make. The linen was {{convert|0.5|cm|in|adj=on}} thick.\n[[File:Ancient athenian warrior.jpg|thumb|150px|Outfit of an ancient Athenian warrior]]\nBy contrast with hoplites, other contemporary infantry (e.g., [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]]) tended to wear relatively light armour, use [[wicker]] shields, and were armed with shorter spears, [[javelin]]s, and [[Bow (weapon)|bows]]. The most famous are the peltasts, light-armed troops who wore no armour and were armed with a light shield, javelins and a short sword. The Athenian general [[Iphicrates]] developed a new type of armour and arms for his mercenary army, which included light linen armour, smaller shields and longer spears, whilst arming his peltasts with larger shields, helmets and a longer spear, thus enabling them to defend themselves more easily against enemy hoplites. With this new type of army he defeated a Spartan army in 392 BC. Nevertheless, most hoplites stuck to the traditional arms and armour.\n\n=== Shield ===\nHoplites carried a large concave shield called an ''[[aspis]]'' (often referred to as a ''hoplon''), measuring between 80\u2013100 centimetres (31\u201339 in) in diameter and weighing between 6.5\u20138 kilograms (14\u201318 lbs).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faculty.fairfield.edu/rosivach/cl115/military/hoplites.htm|title=Hoplites Arms and Armor|last=Zimmel, Girard|first=Jonathan, Todd|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Fink|first1=Dennis|title=The Battle of Marathon in Scholarship: Research, Theories and Controversies Since 1850|date=2014|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786479733|page=32|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kdFsAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA32}}</ref> This large shield was made possible partly by its shape, which allowed it to be supported on the shoulder. The hoplon shield was put together in three layers: the center layer was made of thick wood, the outside layer facing the enemy was made of bronze, and leather made up the inside of the shield. The revolutionary part of the shield was, in fact, the grip. Known as an Argive grip, it placed the handle at the edge of the shield, and was supported by a leather fastening (for the forearm) at the centre. These two points of contact eliminated the possibility of the shield swaying to the side after being struck, and as a result soldiers rarely lost their shields. This allowed the hoplite soldier more mobility with the shield, as well as the ability to capitalize on its offensive capabilities and better support the phalanx. The large hoplon shields, designed for pushing ahead, were the most essential equipment for the hoplites.<ref>{{cite book|title=Warfare in Ancient Greece: A Sourcebook|last=Sage|first=Michael M|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|location=London, GBR|page=281}}</ref>\n\n=== Spear ===\n[[File:Spartan hoplite-1 from Vinkhuijzen.jpg|thumb|upright|Hoplite. Print from Vinkhuijzen Collection of Military Costume Illustration.]]\nThe main offensive weapon used was a {{convert|2.4|-|4.5|m|ft|1|adj=on}} long and {{convert|2.5|cm|in|0|adj=on}} in diameter [[spear]] called a [[Dory (spear)|''doru'', or ''dory'']]. It was held with the right hand, with the left hand holding the hoplite's shield. Soldiers usually held their spears in an underhand position when approaching but once they came into close contact with their opponents, they were held in an overhand position ready to strike. The spearhead was usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a ''sauroter'' (\"lizard-killer\") which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence the name). It was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped, or for the rear ranks to finish off fallen opponents as the phalanx advanced over them. In addition to being used as a secondary weapon, the sauroter also doubled to balance the spear, but not for throwing purposes. It is a matter of contention, among historians, whether the hoplite used the spear overarm or underarm. Held underarm, the thrusts would have been less powerful but under more control, and vice versa. It seems likely that both motions were used, depending on the situation. If attack was called for, an overarm motion was more likely to break through an opponent's defence. The upward thrust is more easily deflected by armour due to its lesser leverage. However, when defending, an underarm carry absorbed more shock and could be 'couched' under the shoulder for maximum stability. It should also be said that an overarm motion would allow more effective combination of the ''aspis'' and ''doru'' if the shield wall had broken down, while the underarm motion would be more effective when the shield had to be interlocked with those of one's neighbours in the battle-line. Hoplites in the rows behind the lead would almost certainly have made overarm thrusts. The rear ranks held their spears underarm, and raised their shields upwards at increasing angles. This was an effective defence against missiles, deflecting their force.\n\n=== Sword ===\nHoplites also carried a sword, mostly a short sword called a ''[[xiphos]]'', but later also longer and heavier types. The short sword was a secondary weapon, used if or when their spears were broken or lost, or if the phalanx broke rank. The xiphos usually had a blade around {{convert|60|cm}} long; however, those used by the Spartans were often only 30\u201345 centimetres long. This very short xiphos would be very advantageous in the press that occurred when two lines of hoplites met, capable of being thrust through gaps in the shieldwall into an enemy's unprotected groin or throat, while there was no room to swing a longer sword. Such a small weapon would be particularly useful after many hoplites had started to abandon body armour during the [[Peloponnesian War]]. Hoplites could also alternatively carry the ''[[kopis]]'', a heavy knife with a forward-curving blade.\n\n== Theories on the transition to fighting in the phalanx ==\n''For more information on this topic: [[Phalanx]]''\n[[File:Hoplite grave relief.jpg|thumb|[[Ancient Greek art|Ancient Greek]] marble [[relief]] c. 330 BC depicting a soldier in combat, holding his weapon above his head as he prepares to strike a fallen enemy; the relief may have been part of an official [[Ancient Athens|Athenian]] state memorial; from the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] collection.]]\nDark age warfare transitioned into hoplite warfare in the 8th century BC. Historians and researchers have debated the reason and speed of the transition for centuries. So far 3 popular theories exist:\n\n=== Gradualist theory ===\nDeveloped by Anthony Snodgrass, the Gradualist Theory states that the hoplite style of battle developed in a series of steps as a result of innovations in armour and weaponry.<ref name=TheoriesOnDevelopment>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.psu.edu/hoplitebattleexperience/theories-on-development/|title=Theories on Development {{!}} Hoplite Battles|website=sites.psu.edu|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> Chronologically dating the archeological findings of hoplite armour and using the findings to approximate the development of the phalanx formation, Snodgrass claims that the transition took approximately 100 years to complete from 750\u2013650 BC.<ref name=Gradualism>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.psu.edu/cams180hoplite/phalanx-theories-2/gradualism/|title=Gradualism {{!}} The Hoplite Battle Experience|website=sites.psu.edu|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> The progression of the phalanx took time because as the phalanx matured it required denser formations that made the elite warriors recruit Greek citizens.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men of Bronze: Hoplite Warfare in Ancient Greece|last=Kagan|first=Donald|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|page=8|quote=|via=}}</ref> The large amounts of hoplite armour needed to then be distributed to the populations of Greek citizens only increased the time for the phalanx to be implemented. Snodgrass believes, only once the armour was in place that the phalanx formation became popular.<ref name=Gradualism/>\n\n=== Rapid adoption theory ===\nThe Rapid Adaptation model was developed by historians Paul Cartledge and Victor Hanson.<ref name=RapidAdoption>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.psu.edu/cams180hoplite/phalanx-theories-2/rapid-adoption/|title=Rapid Adoption {{!}} The Hoplite Battle Experience|website=sites.psu.edu|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref> The historians believe that the phalanx was created individually by military forces, but was so effective that others had to immediately adapt their way of war to combat the formation.<ref name=RapidAdoption/> Rapid Adoptionists propose that the double grip, hoplon shield that was required for the phalanx formation was so constricting in mobility that once it was introduced, dark age, free flowing warfare was inadequate to fight against the hoplites only escalating the speed of the transition.<ref name=TheoriesOnDevelopment/> Quickly, the phalanx formation and hoplite armour became widely used throughout Ancient Greece. Cartledge and Hanson estimate the transition took place from 725\u2013675 BC.<ref name=RapidAdoption/>\n\n=== Extended gradualist theory ===\n[[File:Detail from the Chigi-vase.jpg|thumb|Chigi Vase with Hoplites holding javelins and spears]]\nDeveloped by Hans Van Wees, the Extended Gradualist theory is the most lengthy of the three popular transition theories. Van Wees depicts iconography found on pots of the Dark Ages believing that the foundation of the phalanx formation was birthed during this time.<ref name=TheoriesOnDevelopment/> Specifically, he uses an example of the Chigi Vase to point out that hoplite soldiers were carrying normal spears as well as javelins on their backs. Matured hoplites did not carry long range weapons including javelins.<ref name=Gradualism/>  The Chigi vase is important for our knowledge of the hoplite soldier because it is one, if not the only one representation of the hoplite formation, known as the phalanx, in Greek art.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/745332893|title=Greek art and archaeology : a new history, c. 2500-c. 150 BCE|last=T.,|first=Neer, Richard|isbn=9780500288771|location=New York|oclc=745332893}}</ref> This led Van Wees to believe that there was a transitional period from long range warfare of the Dark Ages to the close combat of hoplite warfare. Some other evidence of a transitional period lies within the text of Spartan Poet Tyrtaios, when he wrote, \"\u2026will they draw back for the pounding [of the missiles, no,] despite the battery of great hurl-stones, the helmets shall abide the rattle [of war unbowed]\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tyrtaios|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=Fragment 1|pages=|quote=|via=}}</ref> At no point in future texts does Tyrtaios involve any talk of missiles or rocks making another case for a transitional period. Extended Gradualists argue that hoplite warriors did not fight in a true phalanx until the 5th century BC.<ref name=TheoriesOnDevelopment/>  Making estimations of the speed of the transition reached as long as 300 years, from 750\u2013450 BC.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Globular aryballos Louvre Ele357.jpg|thumb|Hoplites on an [[aryballos]] from Corinth, c. 580\u2013560 BC ([[Louvre]])]]\n\n===Ancient Greece===\n''For more information on this topic: [[Ancient Greek warfare]]''\n\nThe exact time when hoplite warfare was developed is uncertain, the prevalent theory being that it was established sometime during the 8th or 7th century BC, when the \"heroic age was abandoned and a far more disciplined system introduced\" and the [[aspis|Argive shield]] became popular.<ref>Peter Connoly, ''Greece and Rome at War'', p. 37.</ref> Peter Krentz argues that \"the ideology of hoplitic warfare as a ritualized contest developed not in the 7th century [BC], but only after 480, when non-hoplite arms began to be excluded from the phalanx\".<ref>Peter Krentz, ''Fighting by the Rules \u2013 The Invention of the Hoplite Agon''.</ref> [[Anagnostis Agelarakis]], based on recent archaeo-anthropological discoveries of the earliest monumental polyandrion (communal burial of male warriors) at [[Paros]] Island in Greece, unveils a last quarter of the 8th century BC date for a hoplitic phalangeal military organization.<ref>F. Zafeiropoulou and A. Agelarakis, \"Warriors of Paros\", ''Archaeology'' 58.1(2005): 30\u201335</ref>\n\nThe rise and fall of hoplite warfare was tied to the rise and fall of the [[city-state]]. As discussed above, hoplites were a solution to the armed clashes between independent city-states. As Greek civilization found itself confronted by the world at large, particularly the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]], the emphasis in warfare shifted. Confronted by huge numbers of enemy troops, individual city-states could not realistically fight alone. During the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] (499\u2013448 BC), alliances between groups of cities (whose composition varied over time) fought against the Persians. This drastically altered the scale of warfare and the numbers of troops involved. The hoplite phalanx proved itself far superior to the Persian infantry at such conflicts as the [[Battle of Marathon]], [[Thermopylae]], and the [[Battle of Plataea]].\n\n[[File:Squatting warrior Staatliche Antikensammlungen 8966.jpg|thumb|left|Crouching warrior, [[tondo (art)|tondo]] of an [[Attica|Attic]] [[black-figure]] [[kylix (cup)|kylix]], c. 560 BC ([[Staatliche Antikensammlungen]])]]\nDuring this period, [[Athens]] and [[Sparta]] rose to a position of political eminence in Greece, and their rivalry in the aftermath of the Persian wars brought Greece into renewed internal conflict. However, the [[Peloponnesian War]] was on a scale unlike conflicts before. Fought between leagues of cities, dominated by Athens and Sparta respectively, the pooled manpower and financial resources allowed a diversification of warfare. Hoplite warfare was in decline; there were three major battles in the Peloponnesian War, and none proved decisive. Instead there was increased reliance on navies, skirmishers, mercenaries, city walls, [[siege engines]], and non-set piece tactics. These reforms made [[Attrition warfare|wars of attrition]] possible and greatly increased the number of casualties. In the Persian war, hoplites faced large numbers of skirmishers and missile-armed troops, and such troops (e.g., [[peltast]]s) became much more commonly used by the Greeks during the Peloponnesian War. As a result, hoplites began wearing less armour, carrying shorter swords, and in general adapting for greater mobility; this led to the development of the [[ekdromos]] light hoplite.\n\nMany famous personalities, philosophers, artists, and poets fought as hoplites.<ref>[[Socrates]] as a hoplite: Plato, ''Symposium'' 219e\u2013221b.</ref><ref>[[Epicurus]] as a hoplite: ''[[Diogenes Laertius]], Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Book X''.</ref>\n\nAccording to Nefiodkin, fighting against Greek heavy infantry during the Greco-Persian Wars inspired the Persians to introduce [[scythed chariot]]s.<ref>{{Citation\n | last = Nefiodkin\n | first = Alexander K.\n | title = On the Origin of the Scythed Chariots\n | journal = Historia: Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Alte Geschichte\n | volume = 53\n | issue = 3\n | year = 2004\n | pages = 371\u2212378\n}}</ref>\n\n===Sparta===\n''For more information on this topic: [[Spartan army]]''\n\n[[Sparta]] is one of the most famous city-states, along with Athens, which had a unique position in ancient Greece. Contrary to other city states, the free citizens of Sparta served as hoplites their entire life, training and exercising also in peacetime, which gave Sparta a professional standing army. Although small, numbering no more than 1,500 to 2,000 men,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} divided into six [[Mora (military unit)|mora]] or [[battalion]]s, the Spartan army was feared for its discipline and ferocity. Military service was the primary duty of Spartan men, and Spartan society was organized around its army.\n[[File:Ancient Macedonian soldiers, from the tomb of Agios Athanasios, Greece.jpg|thumb|upright|Paintings of [[Ancient Macedonia]]n [[Ancient Macedonian army|soldiers]], arms, and armaments, from the tomb of [[Agios Athanasios, Thessaloniki]] in Greece, 4th century BC]]\n\nMilitary service for hoplites lasted until the age of 40, and sometimes even until 60 years of age, depending on a man's physical ability to perform on the battlefield.\n\n===Macedonia===\n''For more information on this topic: [[Ancient Macedonian army]]''\n\nLater on in the hoplite era, more sophisticated tactics were developed, in particular by the [[Thebes (Greece)|Theban]] general [[Epaminondas]]. These tactics inspired the future king [[Philip&nbsp;II of Macedon]], who was at the time a hostage in Thebes, and also inspired the development of new kind of infantry, the [[Macedonian phalanx]]. After the Macedonian conquests of the 4th century BC, the hoplite was slowly abandoned in favour of the [[phalangite]], armed in the Macedonian fashion, in the armies of the southern Greek states. Although clearly a development of the hoplite, the Macedonian phalanx was tactically more versatile, especially used in the combined arms tactics favoured by the [[Ancient Macedonian army|Macedonians]]. These forces defeated the last major hoplite army, at the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BC), after which Athens and its allies joined the Macedonian empire.\n\nWhile [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's]] [[Ancient Macedonian army|army]] mainly fielded ''[[Pezhetairoi]]'' (= Foot Companions) as his main force, it is known that his army also included some classic hoplites, either provided by the [[League of Corinth]] or from hired mercenaries. Beside these units, the Macedonians also used the so-called ''[[Hypaspists]]'', an elite force of units possibly originally fighting as hoplites and used to guard the exposed right wing of Alexander's phalanx.\n\n===Hoplite-style warfare outside Greece===\n[[File:Etruscan warrior near Viterbe Italy circa 500 BCE.jpg|thumb|Etruscan warrior, found near [[Viterbo]], [[Italy]], dated circa 500 BC.]]\nHoplite-style warfare was very influential and influenced several other nations in the Mediterranean. Hoplite warfare was the dominant fighting style on the [[Italian Peninsula]] up to the early 3rd century BC, employed by both the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] and the [[Early Roman army]]. The Romans later changed their fighting style to a more flexible [[Maniple (military unit)|maniple]] organization, which was more versatile on rough terrain like that of [[Samnium]]. Roman equipment also changed, and they reequipped their soldiers with longer oval shields (''[[Scutum (shield)|scutum]]''), swords and heavy javelins (''[[pilum]]''). In the end only the ''[[triarii]]'' would keep a long spear (''[[Hasta (spear)|hasta]]'') as their main weapon. However, the triarii would still fight in a traditional phalanx formation. Though the Italian tribes, namely the [[socii]] fighting with the Romans, later adopted the new Roman fighting style, some continued to fight as hoplites. Local levied troops or mercenaries serving under [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]] or [[Hannibal]] (namely Etruscans) were equipped and fought as hoplites.\n\n[[Ancient Carthage|Early in its history, Ancient Carthage]] also equipped its troops as Greek hoplites, in units such as the [[Sacred Band of Carthage]]. Many Greek hoplite mercenaries also fought in foreign armies, such as Carthage and [[Achaemenid Empire]], where it is believed by some that they inspired the formation of the [[Cardaces]]. Some hoplites served under the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] king [[Bardylis]] in the 4th century. The Illyrians were known to import many weapons and tactics from the Greeks.\n\nThe [[Diadochi]] imported the Greek phalanx to their kingdoms. Though they mostly fielded Greek citizens or mercenaries, they also armed and drilled local natives as hoplites or rather Macedonian phalanx, like the [[Machimoi]] of the [[Ptolemaic army]].\n\n===Hellenistic period===\n{{main|Hellenistic armies}}\nThe [[Hellenistic armies|Greek armies]] of the [[Hellenistic period]] mostly fielded troops in the fashion of the Macedonian phalanx. Nonetheless many armies of mainland Greece stuck with hoplite warfare. Besides classical hoplites Hellenistic nations began to field two new types of hoplites, the ''[[Thureophoroi]]'' and the ''[[Thorakitai]]''. They developed when Greeks adopted the [[Celt]]ic ''[[Thureos]]'' shield, of an oval shape that was similar to the shields of the Romans, but flatter. The Thureophoroi were armed with a long thrusting spear, a short sword and, if needed, javelins. While the Thorakitai were similar to the Thureophoroi, they were more heavily armoured, as their name implies, usually wearing a mail shirt. These troops were used as a link between the light infantry and the phalanx, a form of medium infantry to bridge the gaps.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n* Crowley, Jason.

In 1516, [[Habsburg Spain]] unified a number of disparate predecessor kingdoms; its modern form of a [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|constitutional monarchy]] was introduced in 1813, and the current [[Spanish transition to democracy|democratic constitution]] dates to 1978.\n\nAfter expelling Muslim rulers in the [[Reconquista]], the [[Crown of Castile]] began to explore across the Atlantic Ocean in 1492, expanding into the [[New World]] and marking the beginning of the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]] under the [[Spanish Empire]]. The kingdoms of Spain were united under [[Habsburg Spain|Habsburg rule]] in 1516, that unified the Crown of Castile, the [[Crown of Aragon]] and smaller kingdoms under the same rule. Until the 1650s, Habsburg Spain was among the most powerful states in the world.\n\nDuring this period, Spain was involved in all major European wars, including the [[Italian Wars]], the [[Eighty Years' War]], the [[Thirty Years' War]], and the [[Franco-Spanish War (1635\u201359)|Franco-Spanish War]]. In the later 17th century, however, Spanish power began to decline, and after the death of the last Habsburg ruler, the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] ended with [[Bourbon Spain|Bourbon reformers in power]]. Spain was at best a second-rate power, important chiefly for its American empire. The so-[[Bourbon Reforms]] restructured state institutions along French lines. Napoleon took over Spain in 1808, but was expelled by rebels and the British army in 1812 in the [[Peninsular War]].\n\nSpain after 1814 was destabilised as different political parties representing \"liberal\", \"reactionary\", and \"moderate\" groups throughout the [[History of Spain (1814\u201373)|remainder of the century]] fought for and won short-lived control without any being sufficiently strong to bring about lasting stability. The former Spanish Empire overseas quickly disintegrated with the [[Latin American wars of independence]]. Only Cuba and the Philippines and some small islands were left; they revolted and the United States acquired ownership (or control, in the case of Cuba) after the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898.\n\nA tenuous balance between liberal and conservative forces was struck in the establishment of [[Restoration (Spain)|constitutional monarchy]] during 1874\u20131931 but brought no lasting solution, and Spain descended into [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] between the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] and the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalist]] factions.\n\nThe war ended in a [[Francoist Spain|nationalist dictatorship]], led by [[Francisco Franco]], which controlled the Spanish government until 1975. The post-war decades were relatively stable (with the notable exception of an armed [[ETA (separatist group)|independence movement]] in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]), and the country experienced rapid economic growth in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nOnly with the death of Franco in 1975 did Spain return to Bourbon constitutional monarchy headed by [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Prince Juan Carlos]] and [[Spanish transition to democracy|to democracy]]. Spain entered the [[European Economic Community]] in 1986 (transformed into the [[European Union]] with the [[Maastricht Treaty]] of 1992), and the [[Eurozone]] in 1999. The [[financial crisis of 2007\u201308]] ended a decade of [[Spanish property bubble|economic boom]] and Spain entered [[2008\u201314 Spanish financial crisis|a recession]] and [[European sovereign debt crisis#Spain|debt crisis]] and remains plagued by very high unemployment and a weak economy.\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistoric Iberia}}\n\n[[File:AltamiraBison.jpg|thumb|A painting of [[bison]] dating from the Upper Paleolithic era in the [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira caves]]]]\n[[File:Ethnographic Iberia 200 BCE.PNG|thumb|Ethnology of the Iberian Peninsula c. 200 BC]]\nThe [[Iberian Peninsula]] was first inhabited by [[anatomically modern humans]] about 32,000 years [[Before Present|BP]].\n\nThe earliest record of [[hominids]] living in Western Europe has been found in the Spanish cave of [[Archaeological Site of Atapuerca|Atapuerca]]; a flint tool found there dates from 1.4 million years ago, and early human [[fossils]] date to roughly 1.2 million years ago.<ref name=\"BBC2007\">{{cite news |title='First west Europe tooth' found |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6256356.stm |agency=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316120128/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6256356.stm |archivedate=March 16, 2018}}</ref> Modern humans in the form of [[Cro-Magnon]]s began arriving in the Iberian Peninsula from north of the [[Pyrenees]] some 35,000 years ago.

The [[Visigoths#Visigothic kingdom in Hispania|Visigothic Kingdom]] shifted its capital to [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and reached a high point during the reign of [[Leovigild]].\n\n=== Visigothic rule ===\n[[File:El rey Don Rodrigo arengando a sus tropas en la batalla de Guadalete (Museo del Prado).jpg|thumb|Visigothic King [[Roderic]] haranguing his troops before the [[Battle of Guadalete]]]]\nThe [[Visigothic Kingdom]] conquered all of Hispania and ruled it until the early 8th century, when the peninsula fell to the [[Muslim conquests]]. The Muslim state in Iberia came to be known as [[Al-Andalus]]. After a period of Muslim dominance, the [[medieval history of Spain]] is dominated by the long Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'' or \"reconquest\" of the Iberian Peninsula from Muslim rule. The Reconquista gathered momentum during the 12th century, leading to the establishment of the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]] and by 1250, had reduced Muslim control to the [[Emirate of Granada]] in the south-east of the peninsula. Muslim rule in Granada survived until 1492, when it fell to the [[Catholic Monarchs]].\n\nImportantly, Spain never saw a decline in interest in classical culture to the degree observable in Britain, Gaul, Lombardy and Germany. The Visigoths, having assimilated Roman culture during their tenure as ''foederati'', tended to maintain more of the old Roman institutions, and they had a unique respect for legal codes that resulted in continuous frameworks and historical records for most of the period between 415, when Visigothic rule in Spain began, and 711, when it is traditionally said to end. However, during the Visigothic dominion the cultural efforts made by the Franks and other Germanic tribes were not felt in the peninsula, nor achieved in the lesser kingdoms that emerged after the Muslim conquest.\n[[File:Hispania 700 AD.PNG|thumb|[[Visigoth]]ic Hispania and its regional divisions in 700, prior to the Muslim conquest]]\n\nThe proximity of the Visigothic kingdoms to the Mediterranean and the continuity of western Mediterranean trade, though in reduced quantity, supported Visigothic culture. Arian Visigothic nobility kept apart from the local Catholic population. The Visigothic ruling class looked to [[Constantinople]] for style and technology while the rivals of Visigothic power and culture were the Catholic bishops \u2013 and a brief incursion of Byzantine power in C\u00f3rdoba.\n\nSpanish Catholic religion also coalesced during this time. The period of rule by the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] saw the spread of [[Arianism]] briefly in Spain.<ref>Rhea Marsh Smith, ''Spain: A Modern History'', pp. 16\u201317.</ref> The [[Councils of Toledo]] debated creed and liturgy in orthodox [[Catholicism]], and the Council of Lerida in 546 constrained the clergy and extended the power of law over them under the blessings of Rome. In 587, the Visigothic king at Toledo, [[Reccared]], converted to Catholicism and launched a movement in Spain to unify the various religious doctrines that existed in the land. This put an end to dissension on the question of Arianism. (For additional information about this period, see the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Spain]].)\n\nThe Visigoths inherited from Late Antiquity a sort of [[feudal]] system in Spain, based in the south on the Roman [[villa]] system and in the north drawing on their vassals to supply troops in exchange for protection. The bulk of the Visigothic army was composed of slaves, raised from the countryside. The loose council of nobles that advised Spain's Visigothic kings and legitimized their rule was responsible for raising the army, and only upon its consent was the king able to summon soldiers.\n\nThe impact of Visigothic rule was not widely felt on society at large, and certainly not compared to the vast bureaucracy of the Roman Empire; they tended to rule as barbarians of a mild sort, uninterested in the events of the nation and economy, working for personal benefit, and little literature remains to us from the period.{{citation needed|reason=5 citations needed|date=September 2015}} They did not, until the period of Muslim rule, merge with the Spanish population, preferring to remain separate, and indeed the Visigothic language left only the faintest mark on the modern languages of Iberia.<ref name=\"Collins, 2006\">Collins, ''Visigothic Spain 409\u2013711'' (2006)</ref>\n\nThe most visible effect was the depopulation of the cities as they moved to the countryside. Even while the country enjoyed a degree of prosperity when compared to the famines of France and Germany in this period, the Visigoths felt little reason to contribute to the welfare, permanency, and infrastructure of their people and state. This contributed to their downfall, as they could not count on the loyalty of their subjects when the Moors arrived in the 8th century.<ref name=\"Collins, 2006\"/>\n\n==Islamic ''al-Andalus'' and the Christian ''Reconquest'' (8th\u201315th centuries)==\n{{main|Muslim conquests|Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Al-Andalus|Spain in the Middle Ages|Reconquista}}\n\n[[File:Map Iberian Peninsula 750-en.svg|thumb|[[al-Andalus]] at its greatest extent, 720]]\nThe [[Arab Islamic conquest]] dominated most of North Africa by 710 AD. In 711 an Islamic [[Berber people|Berber]] conquering party, led by [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]], was sent to Iberia to intervene in a civil war in the [[Visigothic Kingdom]]. Tariq's army contained about 7,000 Berber horsemen, and [[Musa bin Nusayr]] is said to have sent an additional 5,000 reinforcements after the conquest.<ref>''[[Akhb\u0101r majm\u016b\u02bfa|Akhb\u0101r majm\u016ba]]'', p. 21 of Spanish translation, p. 6 of Arabic text.</ref> Crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], they won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic King [[Roderic]] was defeated and killed on July 19 at the [[Battle of Guadalete]].\n\nTariq's commander, Musa, quickly crossed with Arab reinforcements, and by 718 the [[Muslim]]s were in control of nearly the whole [[Iberian Peninsula]]. The advance into [[Western Europe]] was only stopped in what is now north-central France by the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] [[Franks]] under [[Charles Martel]] at the [[Battle of Tours]] in 732.\n\nA decisive victory for the Christians took place at Covadonga, in the north of the Iberian Peninsula, in the summer of 722. In a minor battle known as the [[Battle of Covadonga]], a Muslim force sent to put down the Christian rebels in the northern mountains was defeated by [[Pelagius of Asturias]], who established the monarchy of the Christian [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. In 739, a rebellion in Galicia, assisted by the Asturians, drove out Muslim forces and it joined the Asturian kingdom. The Kingdom of Asturias became the main base for Christian resistance to Islamic rule in the Iberian Peninsula for several centuries.\n\n[[Caliph]] [[Al-Walid I]] had paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] era (the second major Arab dynasty after Mohammad and the first Arab dynasty of [[Al-Andalus]]).

It is not clear if Abd al-Rahman considered himself to be a rival caliph, perpetuating the Umayyad Caliphate, or merely an independent Emir. The state founded by him is known as the [[Emirate of Cordoba]].

Despite the decline in Muslim-controlled kingdoms, they had lasting effects in culture and society on the peninsula.\n\nThe Taifa kingdoms lost ground to the Christian realms in the north. After the loss of Toledo in 1085, the Muslim rulers reluctantly invited the [[Almoravides]], who invaded Al-Andalus from North Africa and established an empire. In the 12th century the Almoravid empire broke up again, only to be taken over by the [[Almohad]] invasion, who were defeated by an alliance of the Christian kingdoms in the decisive [[battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] in 1212.

These were the Latin-based [[Romance languages]] of [[Spanish language|Castilian]], [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]], [[Galician language|Galician]], [[Aranese language|Aranese]], [[Asturian language|Asturian]] and [[Leonese language|Leonese]], and the ancient [[language isolate]] of [[Basque language|Basque]]. Throughout the century, Castilian (what is also known today as Spanish) gained a growing prominence in the Kingdom of Castile as the language of culture and communication, at the expense of Leonese and of other close dialects.\n\nOne example of this is the oldest preserved Castilian epic poem, ''[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]'', written about the military leader ''[[El Cid]]''. In the last years of the reign of [[Ferdinand III of Castile]], Castilian began to be used for certain types of documents, and it was during the reign of [[Alfonso X of Castile|Alfonso X]] that it became the official language. Henceforth all public documents were written in Castilian; likewise all translations were made into Castilian instead of Latin.\n\nAt the same time, Catalan and Galician became the standard languages in their respective territories, developing important literary traditions and being the normal languages in which public and private documents were issued: Galician from the 13th to the 16th century in Galicia and nearby regions of Asturias and Leon,<ref name=\"Paz1999\">{{cite book|author=Ram\u00f3n Mari\u00f1o Paz|title=Historia da lingua galega|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=78x6QgAACAAJ|accessdate=19 August 2013|year=1999|publisher=Sotelo Blanco Edici\u00f3ns|isbn=978-84-7824-333-4|pages=182\u2013194}}</ref> and Catalan from the 12th to the 18th century in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands and Valencia, where it was known as Valencian. Both languages were later substituted in its official status by Castilian Spanish, till the 20th century.\n\nIn the 13th century many universities were founded in Le\u00f3n and in Castile. Some, such as the Leonese [[University of Salamanca|Salamanca]] and the Castilian Palencia, were among the earliest universities in Europe.\n\nIn 1492, under the [[Catholic Monarchs]], the first edition of the ''[[Grammar of the Castilian Language]]'' by [[Antonio de Nebrija]] was published.\n\n==Early Modern Spain==\n{{main|Habsburg Spain|Spanish Golden Age|Spain in the 17th century|Enlightenment in Spain{{!}}Bourbon Spain}}\n\n===Dynastic union of the Catholic Monarchs===\n[[File:CastillaLeon 1360.png|thumb|Iberian polities circa 1360]]\nIn the 15th century, the most important among all of the separate Christian kingdoms that made up the old [[Hispania]] were the [[Kingdom of Castile]] (occupying northern and central portions of the Iberian Peninsula), the [[Kingdom of Aragon]] (occupying northeastern portions of the peninsula), and the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] occupying the far western Iberian Peninsula.  The rulers of the kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were allied with dynastic families in Portugal, France, and other neighboring kingdoms.\n\nThe death of King [[Henry IV of Castile]] in 1474 set off a struggle for power called the [[War of the Castilian Succession]] (1475\u201379). Contenders for the throne of Castile were Henry's one-time heir [[Joanna la Beltraneja]], supported by Portugal and France, and Henry's half-sister Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]], supported by the Kingdom of Aragon and by the Castilian nobility.\n\nIsabella retained the throne and ruled jointly with her husband, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand II]]. Isabella and Ferdinand had married in 1469<ref>Hugh Thomas, ''Rivers of Gold'' (Random House: New York, 2003) p. 18.</ref> in [[Valladolid]]. Their marriage united both crowns and set the stage for the creation of the Kingdom of Spain, at the dawn of the modern era. That union, however, was a union in title only, as each region retained its own political and judicial structure.

Spain established colonies in North Africa that ranged from the Atlantic Moroccan coast to [[Tripoli]] in Libya. [[Melilla]] was occupied in 1497 and [[Ceuta]] was annexed from the Portuguese in 1668. Today, both still remain under Spanish control, together with smaller islets known as the ''[[presidio]]s menores'' ([[Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de V\u00e9lez de la Gomera]], [[Alhucemas Islands|las Islas de Alhucemas]], [[Chafarinas Islands|las Islas de Chafarinas]]).\n\nAlthough until the 13th century religious minorities (Jews and Muslims) had enjoyed considerable tolerance in Castile and Aragon \u2013 the only Christian kingdoms where Jews were not restricted from any professional occupation \u2013 the situation of the Jews collapsed over the 14th century, reaching a climax in 1391 with large scale massacres in every major city except [[\u00c1vila, Spain|\u00c1vila]].\n\nOver the next century, half of the estimated 80,000 [[Spanish Jews]] converted to Christianity (becoming \"[[conversos]]\").{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The final step was taken by the Catholic Monarchs, who, in 1492, ordered the remaining Jews to convert or face expulsion from Spain.

This and subsequent expeditions led to an influx of wealth into Spain, supplementing income from within Castile for the state that would prove to be a dominant power of Europe for the next two centuries.\n\nIsabella ensured long-term political stability in Spain by arranging strategic marriages for each of her five children. Her firstborn, a daughter named [[Isabella of Asturias|Isabella]], married [[Afonso, Prince of Portugal|Afonso of Portugal]], forging important ties between these two neighboring countries and hopefully ensuring future alliance, but Isabella soon died before giving birth to an heir. [[Joanna of Castile|Juana]], Isabella's second daughter, married into the [[Habsburg dynasty]] when she wed [[Philip the Handsome|Philip the Fair]], the son of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], King of Bohemia (Austria) and likely heir to the crown of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].\n\nThis ensured an alliance with the Habsburgs and the [[Holy Roman Empire]], a powerful, far-reaching territory that assured Spain's future political security. Isabella's only son, [[Juan, Prince of Asturias|Juan]], married [[Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy|Margaret of Austria]], further strengthening ties with the Habsburg dynasty. Isabella's fourth child, [[Maria of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Maria]], married [[Manuel I of Portugal]], strengthening the link forged by her older sister's marriage.

It was also one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] in world history. In the 16th century, Spain and Portugal were in the vanguard of European global exploration and colonial expansion. The two kingdoms on the conquest and Iberian Peninsula competed with each other in opening of trade routes across the oceans. Spanish imperial conquest and colonization began with the [[Canary Islands]] in 1312 and 1402.<ref>Hugh Thomas, ''Rivers of Gold'', p. 58.</ref> which began the [[Canary Islands#Castilian conquest|Castilian conquest]] of the Canary Islands, completed in 1495.\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, trade flourished across the Atlantic between Spain and the Americas and across the Pacific between East Asia and Mexico via the Philippines.

In the 1520s, large-scale extraction of silver from the rich deposits of Mexico's [[Guanajuato]] began to be greatly augmented by the silver mines in Mexico's [[Zacatecas]] and Bolivia's [[Potos\u00ed]] from 1546. These silver shipments re-oriented the Spanish economy, leading to the importation of luxuries and grain.

For a time, the Spanish Empire dominated the oceans with its experienced [[Spanish navy|navy]] and ruled the European battlefield with its fearsome and well trained infantry, the famous ''{{lang|es|[[tercio]]s}}''.\n\nThe financial burden within the peninsula was on the backs of the peasant class while the nobility enjoyed an increasingly lavish lifestyle. From the time beginning with the incorporation of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in 1580 (lost in 1640) until the loss of its American colonies in the 19th century, Spain maintained the largest empire in the world even though it suffered fluctuating military and economic fortunes from the 1640s.\n\nReligion played a very strong role in the spread of the Spanish empire. The thought that Spain could bring Christianity to the New World and protect Catholicism in Europe certainly played a strong role in the expansion of Spain's empire.<ref> Raymond Carr, ed., ''Spain: A History'' (2000) pp 116-72.</ref>\n\n===Spanish Kingdoms under the Habsburgs (16th\u201317th centuries)===\n{{main|Habsburg Spain}}\n\n[[File:Emperor charles v.png|thumb|[[Charles I of Spain]] (better known in the English-speaking world as the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Charles V) was the most powerful European monarch of his day.<ref name=\"Patrick2007\">{{cite book|author=James Patrick|title=Renaissance and Reformation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i6ZJlLHLPY8C&pg=PA207|accessdate=19 August 2013|year=2007|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7651-1|page=207}}</ref>]]\nSpain's world empire reached its greatest territorial extent in the late 18th century but it was under the [[Habsburg]] dynasty in the 16th and 17th centuries it reached the peak of its power and declined. When Spain's first Habsburg ruler [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] became king of Spain in 1516, Spain became central to the dynastic struggles of Europe. After he became king of Spain, Charles also became [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and because of his widely scattered domains was not often in Spain. As he approached the end of his life he made provision for the division of the Habsburg inheritance into two parts. On the one hand was Spain, its possessions in Italy, North Africa, the Americas and Northern Europe; on the other hand was the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This was to create enormous difficulties for his son [[Philip II of Spain]].\n\nPhilip II became king in 1556 and reigned until 1598. Spain penalized heresy heavily and largely suppressed the religious conflicts that were raging throughout the rest of Europe. By promoting Catholicism, Philip saw himself as a champion of the Church in a religious war against the Muslims and Protestants.<ref name=\"Braudel1976\">{{cite book|author=Fernand Braudel|title=The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hiQJAQAAIAAJ|volume=II|year=1976|publisher=Harper & Row|isbn=978-0-06-090567-5|page=1165}}</ref>\n\nSpain's downfall came in its extremely expensive failed [[Eighty Years' War|80 year war]] to destroy Protestantism in the Netherlands. The Dutch armies waged a war of [[maneuver warfare|maneuver]] and [[siege]], successfully avoiding [[pitched battle|set piece battles]]. This conflict consumed much Spanish expenditure during the later 16th century. Other extremely expensive failures included an attempt to invade Protestant England in 1588 that produced the worst military disaster in Spanish history when the [[Spanish Armada]]\u2014costing 10 million ducats\u2014was scattered by a freak storm. It struck back at English attacks and with the help of a bungled English counter attack ([[English Armada]]) quickly recovered its preeminent position which it maintained for another half of a century. Spain also provided support to a gruelling Irish war which drained England of resources and also raided English coastal towns. Now, however, the Spanish Habsburgs had yet another powerful enemy with which to contend, forcing Spain to maintain an even stronger, more expensive navy, atop of massive expenditures for its armies in its many scattered territories.\n\nThe growing flow of New World silver seemed to promise relief, but very little coin made it to Spain's treasury, and instead it caused inflation that hurt the economy. By 1600 Spain was still the leading European power, but France was catching up. The [[Iberian Union]] with Portugal meant that the monarch of Castile was also the monarch of Portugal, but they were ruled as separate entities both on the peninsula and in Spanish America and Brazil. In 1640, the [[House of Braganza]] revolted against Spanish rule and reasserted Portugal's independence.<ref name=\"LockhartSchwartz1983\">{{cite book|author1=James Lockhart|author2=Stuart B.

Rising [[price revolution|inflation]], financially draining wars in Europe, the ongoing aftermath of the expulsion of the Jews and Moors from Spain, and Spain's growing dependency on the silver imports, combined to cause several bankruptcies that caused economic crisis in the country, especially in heavily burdened Castile.\n\n[[Barbary pirates|Ottoman pirates]] based in Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli became an increasing problem. The coastal villages of Spain and of the [[Balearic Islands]] were frequently attacked. [[Formentera]] was even temporarily abandoned by its population. This occurred also along long stretches of the Spanish and Italian coasts, a relatively short distance across a calm sea from the pirates in their North African lairs. The most famous corsair was the Turkish [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa]] (\"Redbeard\").<ref name=\"researchnews.osu.edu\">[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm ''When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220038/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm |date=2011-07-25 }}</ref> Somewhere between 100,000 and 250,000 Iberians<ref>{{cite web|title=Fort Caroline, the Search for America's Lost Heritage|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gx7zBgAAQBAJ&pg=PT35}}</ref> were captured by Ottoman pirates and sold as slaves in the [[Ottoman Empire]].

[[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], regarded as one of the most influential painters of European history and a greatly respected artist in his own time, cultivated a relationship with King Philip IV and his chief minister, the [[Count-Duke of Olivares]], leaving us several portraits that demonstrate his style and skill. [[El Greco]], a respected Greek artist from the period, settled in Spain, and infused Spanish art with the styles of the Italian renaissance and helped create a uniquely Spanish style of painting.\n\nSome of Spain's greatest music is regarded as having been written in the period. Such composers as [[Tom\u00e1s Luis de Victoria]], [[Luis de Mil\u00e1n]] and [[Alonso Lobo]] helped to shape [[Renaissance music]] and the styles of [[counterpoint]] and [[polychoral]] music, and their influence lasted far into the [[Baroque music|Baroque period]].\n\nSpanish literature blossomed as well, most famously demonstrated in the work of [[Miguel de Cervantes]], the author of ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quixote de la Mancha]]''.

The Peace of the Pyrenees (1659) had ended fifty years of warfare with France, whose king, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], found the temptation to exploit a weakened Spain too great. Louis instigated the [[War of Devolution]] (1667\u201368) to acquire the [[Spanish Netherlands]].\n\nBy the 17th century, the Catholic Church and Spain had showcased a close bond to one another, attesting to the fact that Spain was virtually free of Protestantism during the 16th century. In 1620, there were 100,000 Spaniards in the clergy; by 1660 the number had grown to about 200,000, and the Church owned 20% of all the land in Spain. The Spanish bureaucracy in this period was highly centralized, and totally reliant on the king for its efficient functioning. Under Charles II, the councils became the sinecures of wealthy aristocrats despite various attempt at reform. Political commentators in Spain, known as [[arbitrista]]s, proposed a number of measures to reverse the decline of the Spanish economy, with limited success. In rural areas of Spain, heavy taxation of peasants reduced agricultural output as peasants in the countryside migrated to the cities. The influx of [[silver from the Americas]] has been cited as the cause of inflation, although only one fifth of the precious metal, i.e. the ''[[quinto real]]'' (royal fifth), actually went to Spain. A prominent internal factor was the Spanish economy's dependence on the export of luxurious [[Merino wool]], which had its markets in northern Europe reduced by war and growing competition from cheaper textiles.\n\nThe once proud Spanish army was falling far behind its foes. It did badly at [[Bergen op Zoom]] in 1622, and finance was not to blame.  The Dutch won very easily at [[Hertogenbosch]] and [[Wesel]] in 1629. In 1632 the Dutch captured the strategic fortress town of [[Maastricht]], repulsing three relief armies and dooming the Spanish to defeat.<ref> Israel, \"The Decline of Spain: A Historical Myth?\" pp. 170\u2013180 </ref>\n\nWhile Spain built a rich American Empire that exported a silver treasure fleet every year, it was unable to focus its financial, military, and diplomatic power on building up its Spanish base. The Crown's dedication to destroying Protestantism through almost constant warfare created a cultural ethos among Spanish leaders that undermined the opportunity for economic modernization or industrialization. When Philip II died in 1598, his treasury spent most of its income on funding the huge deficit, which continued to grow. In peninsular Spain, the productive forces were undermined by steady inflation, heavy taxation, immigration of ambitious youth to the colonies, and by depopulation. Industry went into reverse \u2013 Seville in 1621 operated 400 looms, where it had 16,000 a century before. Religiosity led by saints and mystics, missionaries and crusaders, theologians and friars dominated Spanish culture, with the psychology of a reward in the next world. Palmer and Colton argue:\n: the generations of crusading against infidels, even, heathens and heretics had produced an exceptionally large number of minor aristocrats, chevaliers, dons, and hidalgos, who as a class were contemptuous of work and who were numerous enough and close enough to the common people to impress their haughty indifference upon the country as a whole. <ref>R.R.

For here was a country which had climbed to the heights and sunk to the depths; which had achieved everything and lost everything; which had conquered the world only to be vanquished itself. The Spanish achievement of the sixteenth century was essentially the work of Castile, but so also was the Spanish disaster of the seventeenth; and it was [[Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset|Ortega y Gasset]]  who expressed the paradox most clearly when he wrote what may serve as an epitaph on the Spain of the House of Austria: \u2018Castile has made Spain, and Castile has destroyed it.\u2019\n\n== Spain under the Bourbons (18th century) ==\n{{main|Enlightenment Spain}}\n\n[[Charles II of Spain|Charles II]], having no direct heir, was succeeded by his great-nephew [[Philip V of Spain|Philippe d'Anjou]], a French prince, in 1700. Concern among other European powers that Spain and France united under a single Bourbon monarch would upset the [[Balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] led to the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] between 1701 and 1714. It pitted powerful France and fairly strong Spain against the Grand Alliance of England, Portugal, Savoy, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nAfter many battles, especially in Spain, the [[treaty of Utrecht]] recognised [[Philip V of Spain|Philip, Duke of Anjou]], Louis XIV's grandson, as King of Spain (as Philip V), thus confirming the succession stipulated in the will of the [[Charles II of Spain]]. However, Philip was compelled to renounce for himself and his descendants any right to the French throne, despite some doubts as to the lawfulness of such an act. Spain's Italian territories were apportioned.<ref>John B.

Her principal aim was to have Spain's lost territories in Italy restored. In 1717, Philip V ordered an [[Spanish conquest of Sardinia|invasion of Sardinia]], which had been given to Austria by the Treaty of Utrecht. Spanish troops then invaded Sicily. The aggression prompted the Holy Roman Empire to form a new pact with the members of the [[Triple Alliance (1717)|Triple Alliance]], resulting in the Quadruple Alliance of 1718. All members demanded Spanish retreat from Sardinia and Sicily, resulting in war by December 1718. The war lasted two years and resulted in a rout of the Spanish. Hostilities ceased with the [[Treaty of The Hague (1720)|Treaty of The Hague]] in February 1720. In this settlement, Philip V abandoned all claims on Italy. Later, however, Spain reconquered [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] during the [[War of the Polish Succession]] (1733\u201335). In 1748, after the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1740\u201348), Spain obtained the duchies of [[Duchy of Parma|Parma]], [[Piacenza]] and [[Duchy of Guastalla|Guastalla]] in northern Italy.\n\nThe rule of the Spanish Bourbons continued under [[Ferdinand VI of Spain|Ferdinand VI]] (1746\u201359) and [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] (1759\u201388). Under the rule of Charles III and his ministers \u2013 [[Leopoldo de Gregorio, Marquis of Esquilache]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino y Redondo, conde de Floridablanca|Jos\u00e9 Mo\u00f1ino, Count of Floridablanca]] \u2013 the economy improved. Fearing that Britain's victory over France in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756\u201363) threatened the [[European balance of power]], Spain allied itself to France and [[Spanish invasion of Portugal (1762)|invaded Portugal]], a British ally, but suffered a series of military defeats and ended up having to cede [[Florida]] to the British at the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)]] while gaining [[Louisiana]] from France. Spain regained Florida with the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]], which ended the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u201383), and gained an improved international standing.\n\nHowever, there were no reforming impulses in the reign of [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles IV]] (1788 to abdication in 1808), seen by some as mentally handicapped. Dominated by his wife's lover, [[Manuel de Godoy]], Charles IV embarked on policies that overturned much of Charles III's reforms. After briefly opposing [[Revolutionary France]] early in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], Spain was cajoled into an uneasy alliance with its northern neighbor, only to be blockaded by the British.  Charles IV's vacillation, culminating in his failure to honour the alliance by neglecting to enforce the [[Continental System]], led to the invasion of Spain in 1808 under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]], Emperor of the French, thereby triggering the [[Peninsular War]], with enormous human and property losses, and loss of control over most of the overseas empire.\n\nDuring most of the 18th century Spain had arrested its relative decline of the latter part of the 17th century. But despite the progress, it continued to lag in the political and mercantile developments then transforming other parts of Europe, most notably in Great Britain, the Low Countries, and France. The chaos unleashed by the Peninsular War caused this gap to widen greatly and Spain would not have an [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment]] reached Spain in attenuated form about 1750. Attention focused on medicine and physics, with some philosophy.  French and Italian visitors were influential but there was little challenge to Catholicism or the Church such as characterized the French [[philosophes]].  The leading Spanish figure was [[Benito Jer\u00f3nimo Feij\u00f3o y Montenegro|Benito Feij\u00f3o]] (1676\u20131764), a Benedictine monk and professor. He was a successful popularizer noted for encouraging scientific and empirical thought in an effort to debunk myths and superstitions.  By the 1770s the conservatives had launched a counterattack and used censorship and the Inquisition to suppress Enlightenment ideas.<ref>Payne, ''History of Spain and Portugal'' (1973) 2:367-71</ref>\n\nAt the top of the social structure of Spain in the 1780s stood the nobility and the church. A few hundred families dominated the aristocracy, with another 500,000 holding noble status. There were 200,000 church men and women, half of them in heavily endowed monasteries that controlled much of the land not owned by the nobles.  Most people were on farms, either as landless peons or as holders of small properties.  The small urban middle class was growing, but was distrusted by the landowners and peasants alike.<ref>Franklin Ford, ''Europe, 1780\u20131830'' (1970) p 32</ref>\n\n==19th century Spain==\n\n===War of Spanish Independence (1808\u201314)===\n{{main|Peninsular War}}\n[[File:El dos de mayo de 1808 en Madrid.jpg|thumb|right|''[[The Second of May 1808]]'' was the beginning of the popular Spanish resistance against Napoleon.]]\n\nIn the late 18th century, Bourbon-ruled Spain had an alliance with Bourbon-ruled France, and therefore did not have to fear a land war. Its only serious enemy was Britain, which had a powerful navy; Spain therefore concentrated its resources on its navy. When the French Revolution overthrew the Bourbons, a land war with France became a threat which the king tried to avoid. The Spanish army was ill-prepared. The officer corps was selected primarily on the basis of royal patronage, rather than merit. About a third of the junior officers had been promoted from the ranks, and while they did have talent they had few opportunities for promotion or leadership. The rank-and-file were poorly trained peasants. Elite units included foreign regiments of Irishmen, Italians, Swiss, and [[Walloons]], in addition to elite artillery and engineering units. Equipment was old-fashioned and in disrepair. The army lacked its own horses, oxen and mules for transportation, so these auxiliaries were operated by civilians, who might run away if conditions looked bad.  In combat, small units fought well, but their old-fashioned tactics were hardly of use against the Napoleonic forces, despite repeated desperate efforts at last-minute reform.<ref>Charles J. Esdaile, ''The Spanish Army in the Peninsular War'' (1988)</ref>  When war broke out with France in 1808, the army was deeply unpopular. Leading generals were assassinated, and the army proved incompetent to handle command-and-control.  Junior officers from peasant families deserted and went over to the insurgents; many units disintegrated. Spain was unable to mobilize its artillery or cavalry. In the war, there was one victory at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]], and many humiliating defeats. Conditions steadily worsened, as the insurgents increasingly took control of Spain's battle against Napoleon.  Napoleon ridiculed the army as \"the worst in Europe\"; the British who had to work with it agreed.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Philip Haythornthwaite|author2=Christa Hook|title=Corunna 1809: Sir John Moore's Fighting Retreat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5c1vy_JumsC&pg=PA17|year=2013|publisher=Osprey |pages=17\u201318|isbn=9781472801982}}</ref> It was not the Army that defeated Napoleon, but the insurgent peasants whom Napoleon ridiculed as packs of \"bandits led by monks\" (they in turn believed Napoleon was the devil).<ref>{{cite book|author=Russell Crandall|title=America's Dirty Wars: Irregular Warfare from 1776 to the War on Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Op1cAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA21|year=2014|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=21|isbn=9781107003132}}</ref>  By 1812, the army controlled only scattered enclaves, and could only harass the French with occasional raids.

Spain was put under a British blockade, and her colonies began to trade independently with Britain but it was the defeat of the [[British invasions of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] in South America (1806 and 1807) that emboldened independence and revolutionary hopes in Spain's North and South American colonies. A major Franco-Spanish fleet was lost at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, prompting the vacillating king of Spain to reconsider his difficult alliance with Napoleon. Spain temporarily broke off from the [[Continental System]], and Napoleon \u2013 aggravated with the Bourbon kings of Spain \u2013 invaded Spain in 1808 and deposed [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], who had been on the throne only forty-eight days after his father's abdication in March 1808.

Thompson says the Spanish revolt was, \"a reaction against new institutions and ideas, a movement for loyalty to the old order: to the hereditary crown of the Most Catholic kings, which Napoleon, an excommunicated enemy of the Pope, had put on the head of a Frenchman; to the Catholic Church persecuted by republicans who had desecrated churches, murdered priests, and enforced a \"loi des cultes\"; and to local and provincial rights and privileges threatened by an efficiently centralized government.<ref>J.

Initially, the Central Junta declared support for Ferdinand VII, and convened a \"[[Cortes Generales|General and Extraordinary Cortes]]\" for all the kingdoms of the Spanish Monarchy.

Napoleon did well when he was in direct command, but that followed severe losses, and when he left in 1809 conditions grew worse for France.  Vicious reprisals, famously portrayed by Goya in \"[[The Disasters of War]]\", only made the Spanish guerrillas angrier and more active; the war in Spain proved to be a major, long-term drain on French money, manpower and prestige.<ref>David Gates, ''The Spanish Ulcer: A History of the Peninsular War'' (1986)</ref>\n\nIn March 1812, the [[C\u00e1diz Cortes]] created the first modern Spanish constitution, the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]] (informally named ''La Pepa'').  This constitution provided for a separation of the powers of the executive and the legislative branches of government.  The Cortes was to be elected by universal suffrage, albeit by an indirect method.  Each member of the Cortes was to represent 70,000 people.  Members of the Cortes were to meet in annual sessions.  The King was prevented from either convening or proroguing the Cortes.  Members of the Cortes were to serve single two-year terms.  They could not serve consecutive terms; a member could serve a second term only by allowing someone else to serve a single intervening term in office.

Trade was handled by American and Dutch traders. The colonies thus had achieved economic independence from Spain, and set up temporary governments or juntas which were generally out of touch with the mother country.  After 1814, as Napoleon was defeated and Ferdinand VII was back on the throne, the king sent armies to regain control and reimpose autocratic rule. In the next phase 1809\u201316, Spain defeated all the uprising. A second round 1816\u201325 was successful and drove the Spanish out of all of its mainland holdings.  Spain had no help from European powers. Indeed, Britain (and the United States) worked against it. When they were cut off from Spain, the colonies saw a struggle for power between Spaniards who were born in Spain (called \"peninsulares\") and those of Spanish descent born in New Spain (called \"creoles\"). The creoles were the activists for independence.  Multiple revolutions enabled the colonies to break free of the mother country. In 1824 the armies of generals [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela defeated the last Spanish forces; the final defeat came at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] in southern [[History of Peru|Peru]].

The Peninsular war ravaged towns and countryside alike, and the demographic impact was the worst of any Spanish war, with a sharp decline in population in many areas caused by casualties, outmigration, and disruption of family life.  The marauding armies seized farmers' crops, and more importantly, farmers lost much of their livestock, their main capital asset.  Severe poverty became widespread, reducing market demand, while the disruption of local and international trade, and the shortages of critical inputs, seriously hurt industry and services.  The loss of a vast colonial empire reduced Spain's overall wealth, and by 1820 it had become one of Europe's poorest and least-developed societies; three-fourths of the people were illiterate. There was little industry beyond the production of textiles in Catalonia. Natural resources, such as coal and iron, were available for exploitation, but the transportation system was rudimentary, with few canals or navigable rivers, and road travel was slow and expensive. British railroad builders were pessimistic about the potential for freight and passenger traffic and did not invest. Eventually a small railway system was built, radiating from Madrid and bypassing the natural resources.  The government relied on high tariffs, especially on grain, which further slowed economic development.  For example, eastern Spain was unable to import inexpensive Italian wheat, and had to rely on expensive homegrown products carted in over poor roads.  The export market collapsed apart from some agricultural products. Catalonia had some industry, but Castile remained the political and cultural center, and was not interested in promoting industry.<ref name=\"PradosSantiago-Caballero\">{{cite web|last1=|author1=Carlos Santiago-Caballero Universidad Carlos III|author2=Leandro Prados de la Escosura Universidad Carlos III and CEPR|title=The Napoleonic Wars: A Watershed in Spanish History?|url=http://www.ehes.org/EHES_130.pdf|website=EHES Working Papers in Economic History No. 1|publisher=European Historical Economics Society|accessdate=29 April 2018|page=1|language=English|format=PDF|date=April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Political turmoil====\nAlthough the ''juntas'', that had forced the French to leave Spain, had sworn by the liberal [[Constitution of 1812]], [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] had the support of conservatives and he rejected it.<ref>{{cite book|author=David R.

There were few settlers or soldiers in Florida, so it was sold to the United States for 5 million dollars. In 1820, an expedition intended for the colonies revolted in [[Cadiz]]. When armies throughout Spain pronounced themselves in sympathy with the revolters, led by [[Rafael del Riego]], Ferdinand relented and was forced to accept the liberal Constitution of 1812.  This was the start of the second bourgeois revolution in Spain, which would last from 1820 to 1823.<ref name=\"John Michael Francis 2006 905\"/>  Ferdinand himself was placed under effective house arrest for the duration of the liberal experiment.\n\nThe tumultuous [[Trienio liberal|three years]] of liberal rule that followed (1820\u201323) were marked by various absolutist conspiracies. The liberal government, which reminded European statesmen entirely too much of the governments of the French Revolution, was viewed with hostility by the [[Congress of Verona]] in 1822, and France was authorized to intervene. France crushed the liberal government with massive force in the so-called \"[[Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis]]\" expedition, and Ferdinand was restored as absolute monarch in 1823. In Spain proper, this marked the end of the second Spanish bourgeois revolution.\n\n[[File:Fusilamiento de Torrijos (Gisbert).jpg|thumb|Execution of Torrijos and his men in 1831.

Having borne only a female heir presumptive, it appeared that Ferdinand would be succeeded by his brother, [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Infante Carlos of Spain]]. While Ferdinand aligned with the conservatives, fearing another national insurrection, he did not view Carlos's reactionary policies as a viable option. Ferdinand \u2013 resisting the wishes of his brother \u2013 decreed the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1830]], enabling his daughter Isabella to become Queen.  Carlos, who made known his intent to resist the sanction, fled to Portugal.\n\nFerdinand's death in 1833 and the accession of [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II as Queen of Spain]] sparked the [[First Carlist War]] (1833\u201339).  Isabella was only three years old at the time so her mother, [[Maria Cristina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies]], was named [[regent]] until her daughter came of age. Carlos invaded the Basque country in the north of Spain and attracted support from absolutist reactionaries and conservatives; these forces were known as the \"Carlist\" forces.  The supporters of reform and of limitations on the absolutist rule of the Spanish throne rallied behind Isabella and the regent, Maria Christina; these reformists were called \"Cristinos.\" Though Cristino resistance to the insurrection seemed to have been overcome by the end of 1833, Maria Cristina's forces suddenly drove the Carlist armies from most of the Basque country. Carlos then appointed the Basque general [[Tom\u00e1s de Zumalac\u00e1rregui]] as his [[commander-in-chief]]. Zumalac\u00e1rregui resuscitated the Carlist cause, and by 1835 had driven the Cristino armies to the [[Ebro River]] and transformed the Carlist army from a demoralized band into a professional army of 30,000 of superior quality to the government forces. Zumalac\u00e1rregui's death in 1835 changed the Carlists' fortunes. The Cristinos found a capable general in [[Baldomero Espartero]]. His victory at the [[Battle of Luchana]] (1836) turned the tide of the war, and in 1839, the [[Convention of Vergara]] put an end to the first Carlist insurrection.<ref name=\"Hodge2008\">{{cite book|author=Carl Cavanagh Hodge|title=Encyclopedia of the age of imperialism: 1800\u20131914.

The Queen Regent, who resisted any such idea, preferred to resign and let Espartero become regent instead in 1840. Espartero's liberal reforms were then opposed by moderates, and the former general's heavy-handedness caused a series of sporadic uprisings throughout the country from various quarters, all of which were bloodily suppressed. He was overthrown as regent in 1843 by [[Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Narv\u00e1ez]], a moderate, who was in turn perceived as too reactionary. Another Carlist uprising, the [[Matiners' War]], was launched in 1846 in [[Catalonia]], but it was poorly organized and suppressed by 1849.\n\n[[Isabella II of Spain]] took a more active role in government after coming of age, but she was immensely unpopular throughout her reign (1833\u201368). She was viewed as beholden to whoever was closest to her at court, and the people of Spain believed that she cared little for them. As a result, there was another insurrection in 1854 led by General [[Domingo Dulce]] y Garay and General [[Leopoldo O'Donnell]] y Jarris.  Their coup overthrew the dictatorship of [[Luis Sartorius|Luis Jose Sartorius]], 1st Count of San Luis.  As the result of the popular insurrection, the ''[[Progressive Party (Spain)|Partido Progresista]]'' (Progressive Party) obtained widespread support in Spain and came to power in the government in 1854.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

Isabella's plan failed and cost Isabella more prestige and favor with the people.  In 1860, Isabella launched a successful [[Spanish-Moroccan War (1859)|war]] against [[Morocco]], waged by generals O'Donnell and [[Juan Prim]] that stabilized her popularity in Spain.\n\nAlongside the French, Spain intervened elsewhere in [[Cochinchina]] (1857\u201363) and [[Mexico]] (1861\u201362). Furthermore, the government accepted Santo Domingo's voluntary return to the Spanish Empire. Spain also extended its military presence in the Pacific off the South American coast.\n\nIn 1866, a revolt led by [[Juan Prim]] was suppressed, but in 1868 there was a further revolt, known as the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]]. The ''[[progresista]]'' generals [[Francisco Serrano y Dominguez|Francisco Serrano]] and [[Juan Prim]] revolted against Isabella and defeated her ''[[moderado]]'' generals at the [[Battle of Alcolea (1868)]].

The [[First Spanish Republic]] (1873\u201374) was immediately under siege from all quarters. The [[Carlist]]s were the most immediate threat, launching a violent insurrection after their poor showing in the 1872 elections.

After the tumult of the [[First Spanish Republic]], Spaniards were willing to accept a return to stability under [[Bourbon dynasty|Bourbon]] rule. The Republican armies in Spain \u2013 which were resisting a [[Carlism|Carlist]] [[Third Carlist War|insurrection]] \u2013 pronounced their allegiance to Alfonso in the winter of 1874\u201375, led by [[Brigadier General]] [[Arsenio Mart\u00ednez-Campos y Ant\u00f3n|Mart\u00ednez-Campos]]. The Republic was dissolved and [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]], a trusted advisor to the king, was named [[President of the Government of Spain|Prime Minister]] on [[New Year's Eve]], 1874.

However, the government had become destabilized by Alfonso XII's unexpected death in 1885, followed by the assassination of prime minister [[Antonio C\u00e1novas del Castillo]] in 1897. The reign of Alfonso XIII (1886\u20131931) saw the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898, culminating in the loss of the Philippines plus Spain's last colonies in the Americas, [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]]; the \"Great War\" in Europe (now known as [[World War I]], 1914\u201318), although Spain maintained neutrality throughout the conflict; the influenza pandemic nicknamed the [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu]] (1918\u201319); and the [[Rif War]] in Morocco (1920\u201326). His reign also saw the rise to dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]], who seized control of the government by military coup in 1923 and ruled as a dictator \u2013 with the monarch's support \u2013 for seven years (1923\u201330). The worldwide recession, marked first by the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]], caused deepening economic hardships in Spain and the resignation of Primo de Rivera's government in 1930. [[Spanish general election, 1931|General elections were held in 1931]] to replace the government, with Republican and anticlerical candidates winning the majority of votes. Alfonso XIII left the country in response to the proclamation of the [[Second Spanish Republic]], although he never abdicated.\n\n===Disaster of 1898===\n[[File:Maine explosion.jpg|thumb|The explosion of the {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}} launched the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in April 1898]]\nIn 1868, [[Cuba]] launched a [[Ten Years' War|war of independence against Spain]]. On that island, as had been the case in Santo Domingo, the Spanish government found itself embroiled in a difficult campaign against an indigenous rebellion. [[Dominican Restoration War|Unlike in Santo Domingo]], however, Spain would initially win this struggle, having learned the lessons of guerrilla warfare well enough to defeat this rebellion. The pacification of the island was temporary, however, as the conflict [[Cuban War of Independence|revived in 1895]] and ended in defeat at the hands of the United States in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] of 1898. Cuba gained its independence and Spain lost its remaining New World colony, [[Puerto Rico]], which together with [[Guam]] and the [[Philippines]] were ceded to the United States for 20 million dollars. In 1899, Spain sold its remaining Pacific islands \u2013 the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], [[Caroline Islands]] and [[Palau]] \u2013 to Germany and Spanish colonial possessions were reduced to [[Spanish Morocco]], [[Spanish Sahara]] and [[Spanish Guinea]], all in Africa.<ref>John L. Offner, ''Unwanted War: The Diplomacy of the United States & Spain over Cuba, 1895\u20131898'' (1992)</ref>\n\nThe \"disaster\" of 1898 created the [[Generation of '98]], a group of statesmen and intellectuals who demanded liberal change from the new government. However both [[Anarchism]] on the left and [[fascism]] on the right grew rapidly in Spain in the early 20th century. A revolt in 1909 in [[Catalonia]] was bloodily suppressed.<ref>H. Ramsden, \"The Spanish 'Generation of 1898': The History of a Concept\", ''Bulletin of the John Rylands University Library of Manchester'', 1974, Vol. 56 Issue 2, pp 443\u2013462</ref>  Jensen (1999) argues that the defeat of 1898 led many military officers to abandon the liberalism that had been strong in the officer corps and turn to the right.  They interpreted the American victory in 1898 as well as the [[Russo-Japanese War|Japanese victory against Russia in 1905]] as proof of the superiority of willpower and moral values over technology. Over the next three decades, Jensen argues, these values shaped the outlook of [[Francisco Franco]] and other Falangists.<ref>Geoffrey Jensen, \"Moral Strength Through Material Defeat?

The outbreak of [[Spanish influenza]] in Spain and elsewhere, along with a major economic slowdown in the postwar period, hit Spain particularly hard, and the country went into debt. A major workers' strike was suppressed in 1919.\n\nSpanish colonial policies in [[Spanish Morocco]] led to an uprising known as the [[Rif War]]; rebels took control of most of the area except for the enclaves of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] in 1921.  King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]] decided to support the dictatorship of General [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] in 1923.  As Prime Minister Primo de Rivera promised to reform the country quickly and restore elections soon. He deeply believed that it was the politicians who had ruined Spain and that governing without them he could regenerate the nation. His slogan was \"Country, Religion, Monarchy.\"\nSpain (in joint action with France) won a decisive military victory in Morocco, (1925\u201326). The war had dragged on since 1917 and cost Spain $800 million.<ref>James A.

In early 1930 bankruptcy and massive unpopularity forced the king to remove Primo de Rivera. Historians depict an idealistic but inept dictator who did not understand government, lacked clear ideas and showed very little political acumen. He consulted no one, had a weak staff, and made frequent strange pronouncements. He started with very broad support but lost every element until only the army was left. His projects ran large deficits which he kept hidden. His multiple repeated mistakes discredited the king and ruined the monarchy, while heightening social tensions.  Urban voters had lost faith in the king, and voted for republican parties in the [[Spanish local elections, 1931|municipal elections of April 1931]]. The king fled the country without abdicating and a republic was established.<ref>Raymond Carr, ''Spain, 1808\u20131975'' (2nd ed 1982) pp 564\u201391</ref>\n\n===Second Spanish Republic (1931\u201336)===\n{{main|Second Spanish Republic}}\n{{see also|Catholicism in the Second Spanish Republic}}\n\nPolitical ideologies were intensely polarized, as both right and left saw vast evil conspiracies on the other side that had to be stopped.  The central issue was the role of the Catholic Church, which the left saw as the major enemy of modernity and the Spanish people, and the right saw as the invaluable protector of Spanish values.<ref>Richard Herr, ''An Historical Essay on Modern Spain'' (1974)  pp 162\u20133</ref>\n\nPower seesawed back and forth, 1931\u201336, as the monarchy was overthrown and complex coalitions formed and fell apart.\n\nUnder the Second Spanish Republic, [[Women's suffrage|women were allowed to vote]] in general elections for the first time. The Republic devolved substantial autonomy to the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and to [[Catalonia]].\n\nThe first governments of the Republic were center-left, headed by [[Niceto Alcal\u00e1-Zamora]] and [[Manuel Aza\u00f1a]]. Economic turmoil, substantial debt, and fractious, rapidly changing governing coalitions led to escalating political violence and attempted coups by right and left.\n\nIn 1933, the [[right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Spanish Confederation of the Autonomous Right]] (CEDA), based on the Catholic vote, won power. An armed rising of workers in October 1934, which reached its greatest intensity in [[Asturias]] and [[Catalonia]], was forcefully put down by the CEDA government. This in turn energized political movements across the spectrum in Spain, including a revived [[anarchism|anarchist]] movement and new reactionary and [[fascist]] groups, including the [[Falange]] and a revived [[Carlism|Carlist]] movement.<ref>Herr, ''An Historical Essay on Modern Spain'' (1974)  pp 154\u201387</ref>\n\nThe end came in a devastating civil war, 1936\u201339, which was won by the conservative, pro-church, Army-backed \u201cNationalist\u201d forces supported by Nazi Germany and Italy.  The Nationalists, led by General [[Francisco Franco]], defeated the Republican coalition of liberals, socialists, anarchists, and communists, which was backed by the Soviet Union.\n\n===Spanish Civil War (1936\u201339)===\n{{main|Spanish Civil War}}\nThe Spanish Civil War was marked by numerous small battles and sieges, and many atrocities, until the rebels (the \"Nationalists\"), led by Francisco Franco, won in 1939. There was military intervention as Italy sent land forces, and Germany sent smaller elite air force and armored units to the rebel side (the Nationalists).  The Soviet Union sold armaments to the \"Loyalists\" (\"Republicans\"), while the Communist parties in numerous countries sent soldiers to the \"International Brigades.\" The civil war did not escalate into a larger conflict, but did become a worldwide ideological battleground that pitted the left and many liberals against Catholics and conservatives. Britain, France and the United States remained neutral and refused to sell military supplies. Worldwide there was a decline in pacifism and a growing sense that another world war was imminent, and that it would be worth fighting for.<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''The Spanish Revolution'' (1970) pp 262\u201376</ref>\n\n====Political and military balance====\nIn the 1930s, Spanish politics were polarized at the left and right extremes of the political spectrum. The left-wing favored [[class struggle]], [[land reform]] to overthrow the land owners,  autonomy to the regions, and the destruction of the Catholic Church. The right-wing groups, the largest of which was CEDA, a Catholic coalition, believed in tradition, stability and hierarchy. Religion was the main dividing line between right and left, but there were regional variations.  The Basques were devoutly Catholic but they put a high priority on regional autonomy. The Left offered a better deal so in 1936\u201337 they fought for the Republicans. In 1937 they pulled out of the war.\n\nThe Spanish Republican government moved to Valencia, to escape Madrid, which was under siege by the Nationalists.  It had some military strength in the Air Force and Navy, but it had lost nearly all of the regular Army.  After opening the arsenals to give rifles, machine guns and artillery to local militias, it had little control over the Loyalist ground forces.  Republican diplomacy proved ineffective, with only two useful allies, the Soviet Union and Mexico.  Britain, France and 27 other countries had agreed to an arms embargo on Spain, and the United States went along. [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] both signed that agreement, but ignored it and sent supplies and vital help, including a powerful air force under German command, the [[Condor Legion]]. Tens of thousands of Italians arrived under Italian command.  Portugal supported the Nationalists, and allowed the trans-shipment of supplies to Franco's forces. The Soviets sold tanks and other armaments for Spanish gold, and sent well-trained officers and political commissars.  It organized the mobilization of tens of thousands of mostly communist volunteers from around the world, who formed the [[International Brigades]].\n\nIn 1936, the Left united in the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] and were elected to power. However, this coalition, dominated by the centre-left, was undermined both by the revolutionary groups such as the [[anarchist]] [[Confederaci\u00f3n Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) and [[Federaci\u00f3n Anarquista Ib\u00e9rica]] (FAI) and by anti-democratic far-right groups such as the [[Falange]] and the [[Carlists]]. The political violence of previous years began to start again. There were gunfights over strikes; landless labourers began to seize land, church officials were killed and churches burnt. On the other side, right wing militias (such as the Falange) and gunmen hired by employers assassinated left wing activists. The Republican democracy never generated the consensus or mutual trust between the various political groups that it needed to function peacefully. As a result, the country slid into civil war. The right wing of the country and high ranking figures in the army began to plan a coup, and when Falangist politician [[Jos\u00e9 Calvo-Sotelo]] was shot by Republican police, they used it as a signal to act while the Republican leadership was confused and inert.<ref>Antony Beevor, ''The Spanish Civil War'' (1982), pp. 49\u201350</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Stanley G.

The Nationalists were much better unified and led than the Republicans, who squabbled and fought amongst themselves endlessly and had no clear military strategy. The Army went over to the Nationalists, but it was very poorly equipped \u2013 there were no tanks or modern airplanes.  The small navy supported the Republicans, but their armies were made up of raw recruits and they lacked both equipment and skilled officers and sergeants.  Nationalist senior officers were much better trained and more familiar with modern tactics than the Republicans.<ref>Michael Alpert, \"The Clash of Spanish Armies: Contrasting Ways of War in Spain, 1936\u20131939,\" ''War in History'' (1999) 6#3 pp 331\u2013351.</ref>\n\nOn 17 July 1936, General [[Francisco Franco]] brought the colonial army stationed in Morocco to the mainland, while another force from the north under General Mola moved south from [[Navarre]]. Another conspirator, General Sanjurjo, who was in exile in Portugal, was killed in a plane crash while being brought to join the other military leaders.  Military units were also mobilised elsewhere to take over government institutions. Franco intended to seize power immediately, but successful resistance by Republicans in the key centers of Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, the Basque country, and other points meant that Spain faced a prolonged civil war. By 1937 much of the south and west was under the control of the Nationalists, whose [[Spanish Army of Africa|Army of Africa]] was the most professional force available to either side. Both sides received foreign military aid: the Nationalists from Nazi Germany and Italy, while the Republicans were supported by organised far-left volunteers from the Soviet Union.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of [[Guernica (town)|Guernica]]]]\nThe [[Siege of the Alc\u00e1zar]] at [[Toledo (Spain)|Toledo]] early in the war was a turning point, with the Nationalists winning after a long siege. The Republicans managed to [[Siege of Madrid|hold out in Madrid]], despite a Nationalist assault in November 1936, and frustrated subsequent offensives against the capital at [[battle of Jarama|Jarama]] and [[battle of Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] in 1937. Soon, though, the Nationalists began to erode their territory, starving Madrid and making inroads into the east. The North, including the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque country]] fell in late 1937 and the Aragon front collapsed shortly afterwards. The [[bombing of Guernica]] on the afternoon of 26 April 1937 \u2013 a mission used as a testing ground for the German [[Luftwaffe]]'s [[Condor Legion]] \u2013 was probably the most infamous event of the war and inspired [[Guernica (painting)|Picasso's painting]]. The [[Battle of the Ebro]] in July\u2013November 1938 was the final desperate attempt by the Republicans to turn the tide. When this failed and [[Barcelona]] fell to the Nationalists in early 1939, it was clear the war was over. The remaining Republican fronts collapsed, as civil war broke out inside the Left, as the Republicans suppressed the Communists. Madrid fell in March 1939.<ref>Paul Preston, ''The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, and Revenge'' (2nd ed. 2007) pp 266\u2013300</ref>\n\nThe war cost between 300,000 and 1,000,000 lives. It ended with the total collapse of the Republic and the accession of Francisco Franco as dictator of Spain. Franco amalgamated all right wing parties into a reconstituted fascist party [[Falange]] and banned the left-wing and Republican parties and trade unions.  The Church was more powerful than it had been in centuries.<ref>Preston, ''The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, and Revenge'' (2007) pp 301\u2013318</ref>\n\nThe conduct of the war was brutal on both sides, with widespread massacres of civilians and prisoners. After the war, many thousands of Republicans were imprisoned and up to 150,000 were executed between 1939 and 1943.  Some 500,000 refugees escaped to France; they remained in exile for years or decades.\n\n===The dictatorship of Francisco Franco (1936\u201375)===\n{{main|Francoist Spain}}\nThe Francoist regime resulted in the deaths and arrests of hundreds of thousands of people who were either supporters of the previous Second Republic of Spain or potential threats to Franco's state. They were executed, sent to prisons or [[concentration camps]]. According to Gabriel Jackson, the number of victims of the White Terror (executions and hunger or illness in prisons) just between 1939 and 1943 was 200,000.<ref>Jackson, Gabriel. ''The Spanish Republic and the Civil War, 1931\u20131939.'' Princeton University Press. 1967. Princeton. p.539</ref>\n\nDuring [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s rule, Spain was officially [[Spain in World War II|neutral in World War II]] and remained largely economically and culturally isolated from the outside world. Under a military dictatorship, Spain saw its political parties banned, except for the official party (Falange). Labour unions were banned and all political activity using violence or intimidation to achieve its goals was forbidden.\n\nUnder Franco, Spain actively sought the return of [[Gibraltar]] by the United Kingdom, and gained some support for its cause at the [[United Nations]]. During the 1960s, Spain began imposing restrictions on Gibraltar, culminating in the closure of the border in 1969. It was not fully reopened until 1985.\n\nSpanish rule in [[Morocco]] ended in 1967. Though militarily victorious in the 1957\u201358 [[Ifni War|Moroccan invasion of Spanish West Africa]], Spain gradually relinquished its remaining African colonies. Spanish Guinea was granted independence as [[Equatorial Guinea]] in 1968, while the Moroccan enclave of [[Ifni]] had been ceded to Morocco in 1969.  Two cities in Africa, [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] remain under Spanish rule and sovereignty.\n\nThe latter years of Franco's rule saw some economic and political liberalization (the [[Spanish miracle]]), including the birth of a tourism industry. Spain began to catch up economically with its European neighbors.<ref>Stanley G. Payne, ''Franco and Hitler: Spain, Germany, and World War II'' (2009)</ref>\n\nFranco ruled until his death on 20 November 1975, when control was given to [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|King Juan Carlos]].<ref>Jean Grugel and Tim Rees, ''Franco's Spain'' (1997)</ref> In the last few months before Franco's death, the Spanish state went into a paralysis. This was capitalized upon by King [[Hassan II of Morocco]], who ordered the '[[Green March]]' into [[Western Sahara]], Spain's last colonial possession.\n\n==Post-Francoist Spain==\n{{main|History of Spain (1975\u2013present)}}\n\n===Transition to democracy===\n{{main|Spanish transition to democracy}}\n\nThe Spanish transition to democracy or new Bourbon restoration was the era when Spain moved from the dictatorship of Francisco Franco to a liberal democratic state. The transition is usually said to have begun with Franco's death on 20 November 1975, while its completion is marked by the electoral victory of the socialist [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|PSOE]] on 28 October 1982.\n\nUnder its current (1978) constitution, Spain is a [[constitutional monarchy]]. It comprises 17 [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous communities]] ([[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]], [[Asturias]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Cantabria]], [[Castile and Le\u00f3n]], [[Castile\u2013La Mancha]], [[Catalonia]], [[Extremadura]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], [[Community of Madrid]], [[Region of Murcia]], [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Valencian Community]], and [[Navarre]]) and 2 autonomous cities ([[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]).\n\nBetween 1978 and 1982, Spain was led by the ''[[Union of the Democratic Centre (Spain)|Uni\u00f3n del Centro Democr\u00e1tico]]'' governments.\nIn 1981 the [[23-F]] coup d'\u00e9tat attempt took place. On 23 February [[Antonio Tejero]], with members of the [[Guardia Civil (Spain)|Guardia Civil]] entered the Congress of Deputies, and stopped the session, where [[Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo]] was about to be named prime minister of the government. Officially, the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] failed thanks to the intervention of King [[Juan Carlos of Spain|Juan Carlos]]. Spain joined [[NATO]] before Calvo-Sotelo left office.\nAlong with political change came [[Spanish society after the democratic transition|radical change in Spanish society]].  Spanish society had been extremely conservative under Franco, but the transition to democracy also began a liberalization of values and social mores.\n\nFrom 1982 until 1996, the social democratic PSOE governed the country, with [[Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez]] as prime minister. In 1986, Spain [[Accession of Spain to the European Union|joined the European Economic Community]] (EEC, now [[European Union]]), and the country hosted the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona and [[Seville Expo '92]].\n\n===Spain within the European Union (1993 to present)===\n{{further|Spanish property bubble|2008\u201314 Spanish financial crisis|Eurozone crisis}}\n\nIn 1996, the centre-right ''Partido Popular'' government came to power, led by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]]. On 1 January 1999, Spain exchanged the ''[[Spanish peseta|peseta]]'' for the new [[Euro]] currency. The peseta continued to be used for cash transactions until January 1, 2002. On 11 March 2004 a number of [[March 11, 2004 Madrid attacks|terrorist bombs exploded on busy commuter trains in Madrid]] by Islamic extremists linked to [[Al-Qaeda]], killing 191 persons and injuring thousands.\nThe election, held three days after the attacks, was won by the PSOE, and [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero]] replaced Aznar as prime minister. As [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar]] and his ministers at first accused [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] of the atrocity, it has been argued that the outcome of the election has been influenced by this event.\n\nIn the wake of its joining the EEC, Spain experienced an economic boom during two decades, cut painfully short by the [[2008\u201314 Spanish financial crisis|financial crisis]] of 2008.\nDuring the boom years, Spain attracted a large number of [[immigration to Spain|immigrants]], especially from the United Kingdom, but also including unknown but substantial [[illegal immigration]], mostly from Latin America, eastern Europe and north Africa.<ref>Giles Tremlett,   [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/26/spain.gilestremlett Spain attracts record levels of immigrants seeking jobs and sun]   ''[[The Guardian]]'', Wednesday 26 July 2006</ref>\nSpain had the fourth largest economy in the [[Eurozone]], but after 2008 the global economic recession hit Spain hard, with the bursting of the housing bubble and unemployment reaching over 25%, sharp budget cutbacks were needed to stay in the Euro zone.

This is neither totally true nor totally false. The Spanish monarchy had never stopped being officially a new juxtaposition of kingdoms and crowns converging on the person of the sovereign. Of course this vision purely of paper reflected neither the authentic political reality nor the social culture and not even fully the juridical, which happened in a background of de facto unity. The fact remains, however, that ... there had never been a proclamation of a Kingdom of Spain, so that difficulties always arose over the legal meaning of the very frequent references to 'Spain' in the legal texts of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.\nThe Spanish sovereigns had always refused the advice... in the sense of establishing a United Kingdom of Spain, preferring to see themselves as vertices of converging scattered kingdoms,  at least in theory.\nEven the Napoleonic Bayonne Constitution of 1808 did not proclaim a kingdom of Spain, but a 'Crown of Spain and the Indies'. On the other hand, 'Spain' was merely a geographical name, a simple Romance version of 'Hispania', whereby its use, in principle, should not have to go beyond the Latin designations 'Gallia' and 'Germania'. Except that, of course, there was in fact a political union of most of that Hispania, and under it there were the very similar Romance languages of the spanned territories, in addition to very close historic, cultural and commercial links.}}</ref> Portugal was also [[Iberian Union|ruled by the House of Habsburg]] with Castile and Aragon but this came to an end with a revolt after sixty years.\n\nThe statehood of Spain is generally accepted by the population of Spain as the Spanish Constitution of 1978<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/constitucion/Paginas/ConstitucionIngles.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620064544/http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/es/constitucion/Paginas/ConstitucionIngles.aspx |archivedate=2013-06-20 |df= }}</ref> was massively approved by universal referendum.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/28295/stanley-meisler/spains-new-democracy|title=Spain's New Democracy|first=Stanley|last=Meisler|date=1 October 1977|publisher=|journal=Foreign Affairs}}</ref> The vigor of the constitutional regime and tacit support by the Spanish population has been repeatedly confirmed ever since through periodical national elections to configure the Spanish Parliament.

In 1978, a decentralization process started after the creation of the current constitution. The constitution established a complex framework that combines the concept of Spain as a single political nation with the existence of autonomy statutes granted to all seventeen regions. The degree of autonomy for a number of regions is fairly high; these are the \u2018historical\u2019 regions. In 1983, all seventeen autonomous communities had adopted a statute. Although differences exist in the level of autonomy between \u2018historical\u2019 and \u2018ordinary\u2019 regions, all communities have experienced an increase in their level of autonomy. The group of the \u2018historical\u2019 communities consists of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia. This group was joined later by Andalusia. The group of \u2018ordinary\u2019 regions consists of the rest of the autonomous communities (Aragon, Asturias, Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, Cantabria, Castilla de La Mancha, Castilla-Leon, Extremadura, Madrid, Murcia, Navarra, La Rioja, and Valencia). The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own parliaments and regional governments. The distribution of powers is different for every community, as laid out in the autonomy statutes. The \u2018ordinary\u2019 regions, which always had fewer powers, have slowly caught up with the \u2018historical\u2019 regions. In 1992, for example, the regional autonomy pact extended the power of the autonomous communities in areas of education and health, especially for the \u2018ordinary\u2019 autonomous communities.

In the latter half of the 1950s, however, the economy began to fail and the government introduced censorship laws limiting dissent. The government became plagued by high inflation and a massive debt.\n\n====Military coups====\nOn May 27, 1960, General [[Cemal G\u00fcrsel]] led [[1960 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|a military coup d'\u00e9tat]], removing President [[Celal Bayar]] and Prime Minister Menderes, the second of whom was executed. The system returned to civilian control in October 1961. A fractured political system emerged in the wake of the 1960 coup, producing a series of unstable government coalitions in parliament alternating between the [[Justice Party (Turkey)|Justice Party]] of [[S\u00fcleyman Demirel]] on the right and the [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] of \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc and [[B\u00fclent Ecevit]] on the left.\n\nThe army issued a memorandum warning the civilian government in 1971, leading to [[1971 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|another coup]] which resulted in the fall of the Demirel government and the establishment of interim governments.\n[[File:Turkey.ogv|thumb|1973 film about contemporary events in Turkey]]\n\nIn July 1974, under Prime Minister Ecevit in coalition with the religious [[National Salvation Party]], Turkey carried out the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]].\n\nThe governments of the National Front, a series of coalitions between rightist parties, followed as Ecevit was not able to remain in office despite ranking first in the elections. The fractured political scene and poor economy led to [[Political violence in Turkey, 1970s|mounting violence]] between ultranationalists and communists in the streets of Turkey's cities, resulting in some 5,000 deaths during the late 1970s.\n\nA [[1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup d'\u00e9tat]], headed by General [[Kenan Evren]], took place in 1980. [[Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey|Martial law]] was extended from 20 to all then existing 67 [[provinces of Turkey]].<ref>\nAmnesty International: Turkey Briefing, London, November 1988, AI Index Eur/44/65/88, {{ISBN|0-86210-156-5}}, page 1; [http://ob.nubati.net/wiki/Illustrated_Reports_of_Amnesty_International#Turkey_Briefing] an online edition with scanned pages; accessed on 31 October 2009\n</ref> Within two years, the military returned the government to civilian hands, although retaining close control of the political scene. The political system came under one-party governance under the [[Motherland Party (Turkey)|Motherland Party]] (ANAP) of [[Turgut \u00d6zal]] (Prime Minister from 1983 to 1989). The ANAP combined a globally oriented economic program with the promotion of conservative social values. Under \u00d6zal, the economy boomed, converting towns like [[Gaziantep]] from small provincial capitals into mid-sized economic boomtowns. Military rule began to be phased out at the end of 1983.<ref>[http://ob.nubati.net/en/campaign.php Amnesty International: ''Human Rights Denied''], London, November 1988, AI Index Eur/44/65/88\n</ref>  In particular in provinces in the south-east of Turkey it was replaced by a [[Martial law and state of emergency in Turkey#OHAL|state of emergency]]. In 1985 the government established [[village guards]] (local paramilitary militias) to [[Kurdish\u2013Turkish conflict|oppose separatist Kurdish groups]].\n\n===Political instability (1987\u20132002)===\nStarting in July 1987, the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|South-East]] was submitted to state of emergency legislation, a measure which lasted until November 2002. With the turn of the 1990s, political instability returned. The [[Turkish general election, 1995|1995 elections]] brought a short-lived coalition between [[Mesut Y\u0131lmaz]]'s ANAP and the [[True Path Party]], now with [[Tansu \u00c7iller]] at the helm.\n\nIn 1997, the military, citing his government's support for religious policies deemed dangerous to Turkey's secular nature, sent a [[1997 Turkish military memorandum|memorandum]] to Prime Minister [[Necmettin Erbakan]] requesting that he resign, which he did.

A new government was formed by ANAP and Ecevit's [[Democratic Left Party (Turkey)|Democratic Left Party]] (DSP) supported from the outside by the center-left [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP), led by [[Deniz Baykal]]. The DSP became the largest parliamentary party in the [[Turkish 1999 elections|1999 elections]]. Second place went to the far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP). These two parties, alongside Y\u0131lmaz's ANAP formed a government. The government was somewhat effective, if not harmonious, bringing about much-needed economic reform, instituting [[Human rights in Turkey|human rights legislation]], and bringing Turkey ever closer to the [[European Union]].\n\n===AKP government (2002\u2013present)===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n{{POV|date=June 2013}}\n[[File:\u015eafak Pavey - The Turkish Experience.webm|thumb|MP [[\u015eafak Pavey]] on the Islamisation of Turkey during the AKP government.]]\nA series of economic shocks led to new [[Turkish general election, 2002|elections in 2002]], bringing into power the conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP) of the former mayor of [[Istanbul]], [[Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan]]. The political reforms of the AKP have ensured the beginning of the negotiations with the European Union. The AKP again won the [[Turkish general election, 2007|2007 elections]], which followed the controversial [[Turkish presidential election, 2007|August 2007 presidential election]], during which AKP member [[Abdullah G\u00fcl]] was elected President at the third round. Recent developments in [[History of Iraq|Iraq]] (explained under positions on terrorism and security), secular and religious concerns, the intervention of the military in political issues, relations with the EU, the [[United States]], and the Muslim world were the main issues. The outcome of this election, which brought the Turkish and Kurdish ethnic/nationalist parties ([[Nationalist Movement Party|MHP]] and [[Democratic Society Party|DTP]]) into the parliament, will affect [[accession of Turkey to the European Union|Turkey's bid for the European Union membership]], as Turkish perceptions of the current process (or lack thereof) affected the results and will continue to affect policy making in coming years.{{original research inline|date=September 2013}}\n\n[[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|AKP]] is the only government in Turkish political history that has managed to win three general elections in a row with an increasing amount of votes received in each one. The AKP has positioned itself in the midpoint of the Turkish political scene, much thanks to the stability brought by steady economic growth since they came to power in 2002. A large part of the population have welcomed the end of the political and economic instability of the 1990s, often associated{{by whom|date=September 2013}} with coalition governments - see [[Economic history of Turkey]]. 2011 figures showed a 9% GDP growth for Turkey.\n\nAlleged members of a clandestine group called [[Ergenekon (organization)|Ergenekon]] were detained in 2008 as part of a long and complex trial.

With Muhammad's death in 632, disagreement broke out over who would [[Succession to Muhammad|succeed him as leader of the Muslim community]] which was eventually resurrected leading to the [[First Fitna]]. The dispute would intensify greatly after the [[Battle of Karbala]], in which Muhammad's grandson [[Hussein ibn Ali]] was killed by the ruling [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Yazid&nbsp;I]], and the outcry for revenge divided the early Islamic community.\n\nBy the [[8th century]], the [[Historical powers#Arab Caliphates|Islamic empire]] extended from [[Al-Andalus|Iberia]] in the west to the [[Indus river]] in the east. Polities such as those ruled by the Umayyads (in the [[Middle East]] and later in [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba|Iberia]]), [[Abbasids]], [[Fatimids]], and [[Mamluk]]s were among the most influential powers in the world. The [[Islamic Golden Age]] gave rise to many centers of culture and [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|science]] and produced notable [[Astronomy in the medieval Islamic world|astronomers]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematicians]], [[Medicine in the medieval Islamic world|doctors]] and [[Islamic philosophy|philosophers]] during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].\n\nIn the early [[13th century]], the [[Delhi Sultanate]] took over northern parts of [[Indian subcontinent]]. In the 13th and 14th centuries, destructive [[Mongol invasions]] from the East, along with the loss of population in the [[Black Death]], greatly weakened the traditional centers of the Islamic world, stretching from [[Persia]] to [[Egypt]], but in the [[Early Modern period]], the [[Ottomans]], the [[Safavids]], and the [[Mughals]] were able to create new world powers again. During the [[19th century|19th]] and early [[20th century|20th]] centuries, most parts of the [[Muslim world]] fell under the influence or direct control of [[Europe]]an \"[[Great Powers]].\" Their efforts to win independence and build modern nation states over the course of the last two centuries continue to reverberate to the present day.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Timeline==\n{{Main|Timeline of Muslim history}}\n\nThe following timeline can serve as a rough visual guide to the most important polities in the Islamic world prior to the [[First World War]]. It covers major historical centers of power and culture, including [[Arabia]], [[Mesopotamia]] (modern [[Iraq]]), [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]), [[Levant]] (modern [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]] and [[Palestine (region)|Israel/Palestine]]), [[Egypt]], [[Maghreb]] (north-west Africa), [[al-Andalus]] ([[Iberia]]), [[Transoxania]] ([[Central Asia]]), [[Hindustan]] (including modern [[Pakistan]]), and [[Anatolia]] (modern [[Turkey]]). It is necessarily an approximation, since rule over some regions was sometimes divided among different centers of power, and authority in larger polities was often distributed among several dynasties. For example, during the later stages of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], even the capital city of [[Baghdad]] was effectively ruled by other dynasties such as the [[Buyyids]] and the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]], while the [[Ottomans]] commonly delegated executive authority over outlying provinces to local potentates, such as the [[Dey]]s of Algiers, the [[Beys of Tunis]], and the [[Mamluks of Iraq]].\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:200\nPlotArea = width:720 height:150 left:75 bottom:20\n\nColors =\n    id:blank value:gray(0.9) #\n    id:rashidun value:teal #\n    id:umayyad value:yelloworange #\n    id:abbasid value:black #\n    id:fatimid value:green #\n    id:ayyubid value:orange #\n    id:mamluk value:gray(0.3) #\n    id:mongol value:powderblue #\n    id:seljuk value:tan1 #\n    id:ghaznavid value:skyblue #\n    id:delhi value:lightorange #\n    id:ottoman value:red #\n    id:khedive value:pink #\n    id:safavid value:yellowgreen #\n    id:qajar value:dullyellow #\n    id:mughal value:lavender #\n\nPeriod = from:600 till:2000\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:100 start:600\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:10 start:600\n\nPlotData=\n align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 width:11 mark:(line,black)\n\n bar: --Region--\n bar:Arabia\n from:632 till: 661 color:rashidun shift:(2,7) text:[[Rashidun]]\n from:661 till: 750 color:umayyad shift:(17,12) text:[[Umayyads]]\n from:750 till: 969 color:abbasid shift:(8,15) text:[[Abbasid Caliphate]]\n from:969 till: 1176 color:fatimid shift:(2,10) text:[[Fatimids]]\n from:1176 till: 1260 color:ayyubid shift:(2,10) text:[[Ayyubids]]\n from:1260 till: 1517 color:mamluk shift:(2,10) text:[[Mamluks]]\n from:1517 till: 1923 color:ottoman shift:(2,10) text:[[Ottomans]]\n bar:Mesopotamia\n from:638 till: 661 color:rashidun \n from:661 till: 750 color:umayyad\n from:750 till: 1258 color:abbasid \n from:1258 till: 1432 color:mongol shift:(2,-4) text:[[Mongols]]\n from:1432 till: 1533 color:blank\n from:1533 till: 1918 color:ottoman\n bar:Persia\n from:651 till: 661 color:rashidun\n from:661 till: 750 color:umayyad \n from:750 till: 1220 color:abbasid \n from:1220 till: 1501 color:mongol\n from:1501 till: 1736 color:safavid shift:(2,-4) text:[[Safavids]]\n from:1736 till: 1794 color:blank\n from:1794 till: 1925 color:qajar shift:(2,-4) text:[[Qajars]]\n bar:Levant\n from:637 till: 661 color:rashidun \n from:661 till: 750 color:umayyad \n from:750 till: 969 color:abbasid \n from:969 till: 1070 color:fatimid \n from:1070 till: 1171 color:abbasid \n from:1171 till: 1260 color:ayyubid\n from:1260 till: 1517 color:mamluk\n from:1517 till: 1923 color:ottoman\n bar:Egypt\n from:637 till: 661 color:rashidun \n from:661 till: 750 color:umayyad \n from:750 till: 969 color:abbasid \n from:969 till: 1171 color:fatimid # shift:(0,-4) text:[[Fatimids]]\n from:1171 till: 1260 color:ayyubid # shift:(2,-4) text:[[Ayyubids]]\n from:1260 till: 1517 color:mamluk\n from:1517 till: 1867 color:ottoman\n from:1867  till: 1914 color:khedive shift:(20,-3) text:[[Khedivate]]\n bar:Maghreb\n from:709 till: 750 color:umayyad \n from:750 till: 920 color:abbasid \n from:920 till: 1040 color:fatimid \n from:1040 till: 1517 color:blank  shift:(0,-4) text:[[various]]\n from:1517  till: 1911 color:ottoman\n bar:al-Andalus\n from:711 till: 1031 color:umayyad \n from:1031 till: 1492 color:blank shift:(0,-4) text:[[various]]\n bar:Transoxania\n from:710 till: 750 color:umayyad \n from:750 till: 1220 color:abbasid\n from:1220 till: 1507 color:mongol shift:(0,-4) text:[[Mongols]]\n from:1507 till: 1920 color:blank shift:(0,-4) text:[[various]]\n bar:Hindustan\n from:712 till: 750 color:umayyad \n from:750 till: 977 color:abbasid\n from:977 till: 1186 color:ghaznavid shift:(0,-4) text:[[Ghaznavids]]\n from:1186 till: 1206 color:blank\n from:1206 till: 1526 color:delhi shift:(0,-4) text:[[Delhi Sultanate]]\n from:1526 till: 1857 color:mughal shift:(0,-4) text:[[Mughals]]\n bar:Anatolia\n from:1077 till: 1300 color:seljuk shift:(0,-4) text:[[Sultanate of Rum]]\n from:1300 till: 1923 color:ottoman\n</timeline>\n\n::: ''Dates are approximate, consult particular articles for details.''\n\n==Early sources==\n{{main|Historiography of early Islam}}\n\nThe study of the earliest periods in Islamic history is made difficult by a lack of sources.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=628}} For example, the most important historiographical source for the origins of Islam is the work of [[al-Tabari]].{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=6}}  While [[al-Tabari]] was an excellent historian by the standards of his time and place, use of his work as a source is problematic for two reasons.  For one, his style of historical writing permitted liberal use of mythical, legendary, stereotyped, distorted, and polemical presentations of its subject matter. Second, al-Tabari's descriptions of the beginning of Islam post-date the events by a large amount of time, al-Tabari having died in 923.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=2}}{{sfn|Hughes|2013|p=56}}\n\nDiffering views about how to deal with the available sources has led to the development of four different approaches to the history of early Islam.  All four methods have some level of support today.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=633}}<ref>See also {{harvnb|Hughes|2013|pp=6 & 7}}, who links the practice of source and tradition (or [[form criticism|form]]) criticism as one approach.</ref>  The ''descriptive'' method uses the outlines of Islamic traditions, while being adjusted for the stories of miracles and faith-centred claims within those sources.{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=629, 633}} [[Edward Gibbon]] and [[Gustav Weil]] represent some of the first historians following the descriptive method.  On the ''[[source criticism|source critical]]'' method, a comparison of all the sources is sought in order to identify which informants to the sources are weak and thereby distinguish spurious material.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=630}}  The work of [[William Montgomery Watt]] and that of [[Wilferd Madelung]] are two source critical examples.  On the ''[[tradition criticism|tradition critical]]'' method, the sources are believed to be based on oral traditions with unclear origins and transmission history, and so are treated very cautiously.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=631}} [[Ignaz Goldziher]] was the pioneer of the tradition critical method, and [[Uri Rubin]] gives a contemporary example.  The ''skeptical'' method doubts nearly all of the material in the traditional sources, regarding any possible historical core as too difficult to decipher from distorted and fabricated material.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=632}}  An early example of the skeptical method was the work of [[John Wansbrough]].\n\nNowadays, the popularity of the different methods employed varies on the scope of the works under consideration. For overview treatments of the history of early Islam, the descriptive approach is more popular.  For scholars who look at the beginnings of Islam in depth, the source critical and tradition critical methods are more often followed.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=633}}\n\nAfter the 8th century, the quality of sources improves.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=9}}  Those sources which treated earlier times with a large temporal and cultural gap now begin to give accounts which are more contemporaneous, the quality of genre of available historical accounts improves, and new documentary sources\u2014such as official documents, correspondence and poetry\u2014appear.{{sfn|Robinson|2010|p=9}} For the time prior to the beginning of Islam\u2014in the 6th century\u2014sources are superior as well, if still of mixed quality.

Under the rule of [[Yazid I]], some Muslims in Kufa began to think that if [[Husayn ibn Ali]] the descendent of Muhammad was their ruler, he would have been more just. He was invited to Kufa but was later betrayed and killed. Imam Husain's son, Imam [[Ali ibn Husain]], was imprisoned along with Husain's sister and other ladies left in [[Karbala]] war. Due to opposition by public they were later released and allowed to go to their native place Medina. One Imam after another continued in the generation of Imam Husain but they were opposed by the Caliphs of the day as their rivals till Imam [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]] came in power as first Caliph of [[Fatimid]] in North Africa when Caliphate and Imamate came to same person again after Imam Ali. These Imams were recognized by Shia Islam taking Imam Ali as first Caliph/ Imam and the same is institutionalised by the [[Safavids]] and many similar institutions named now as [[Ismaili]], [[Twelver]] etc.\n\nThe period under [[Muawiya II]] was marked by civil wars ([[Second Fitna]]). This would ease in the reign of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]], a well-educated and capable ruler. Despite the many political problems that impeded his rule, all important records were translated into Arabic. In his reign, a [[currency]] for the Muslim world was minted. This led to war with the Byzantine Empire under [[Justinian II]] ([[Battle of Sebastopolis]]) in 692 in [[Asia Minor]]. The Byzantines were decisively defeated by the Caliph after the defection of a large contingent of [[Slavs]]. The Islamic currency was then made the exclusive currency in the Muslim world.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} He reformed agriculture and commerce.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Abd al-Malik consolidated Muslim rule and extended it, made Arabic the state language, and organized a regular [[postal service]].\n[[File:The Saracen Army outside Paris, 730-32 AD.png|thumb|Umayyad army invades France after conquering the Iberian Peninsula]][[Al-Walid I]] began the next stage of Islamic conquests. Under him the early Islamic empire reached its farthest extent. He reconquered parts of Egypt from the Byzantine Empire and moved on into [[Carthage]] and across to the west of North Africa. Muslim armies under [[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] crossed the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and began to [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|conquer the Iberian Peninsula]] using North African [[Berber people|Berber]] armies. The [[Visigoths]] of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] were defeated when the Umayyad conquered [[Lisbon]]. The Iberian Peninsula was the farthest extent of Islamic control of Europe (they were stopped at the [[Battle of Tours]]). In the east, Islamic armies under [[Muhammad bin Qasim]] made it as far as the [[Indus Valley]]. Under Al-Walid, the caliphate empire stretched from the Iberian Peninsula to India. [[Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] played a crucial role in the organization and selection of military commanders. Al-Walid paid great attention to the expansion of an organized military, building the strongest navy in the Umayyad era., This tactic was crucial for the expansion to the Iberian Peninsula. His reign is considered to be the apex of Islamic power.\n\n[[Sulayman ibn Abd al-Malik]] was hailed as caliph the day al-Walid died. He appointed [[Yazid ibn al-Muhallab]] governor of [[Mesopotamia]]. Sulayman ordered the arrest and execution of the family of [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf|al-Hajjaj]], one of two prominent leaders (the other was [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]]) who had supported the succession of al-Walid's son Yazid, rather than Sulayman. Al-Hajjaj had predeceased al-Walid, so he posed no threat. Qutaibah renounced allegiance to Sulayman, though his troops rejected his appeal to revolt. They killed him and sent his head to Sulayman. Sulayman did not move to [[Damascus]] on becoming Caliph, remaining in [[Ramla]]. Sulayman sent [[Maslama ibn Abd al-Malik]] to attack the Byzantine capital ([[Siege of Constantinople (717\u201318)|siege of Constantinople]]). The intervention of [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]] on the Byzantine side proved decisive. The Muslims sustained heavy losses. Sulayman died suddenly in 717.\n\n[[Yazid II]] came to power on the death of Umar II. Yazid fought the Kharijites, with whom Umar had been negotiating, and killed the Kharijite leader Shawdhab. In Yazid's reign, civil wars began in different parts of the empire.<ref>In the Al-Andalus (the Iberian Peninsula), North Africa and in the east populations revolted. In A.H. 102 (720\u2013721) in Ifriqiyah, the harsh governor Yazid ibn Muslim was overthrown and Muhammad ibn Yazid, the former governor, restored to power. The caliph accepted this and confirmed Muhammad ibn Yazid as governor of Ifriqiyah.</ref> Yazid expanded the Caliphate's territory into the Caucasus, before dying in 724. Inheriting the caliphate from his brother, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] ruled an empire with many problems. He was effective in addressing these problems, and in allowing the Umayyad empire to continue as an entity. His long rule was an effective one, and renewed reforms introduced by Umar II. Under Hisham's rule, regular raids against the Byzantines continued. In North Africa, Kharijite teachings combined with local restlessness to produce the [[Berber Revolt]]. He was also faced with a revolt by [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. Hisham suppressed both revolts. The Abbasids continued to gain power in Khurasan and Iraq. However, they were not strong enough to make a move yet. Some were caught and punished or executed by eastern governors. The [[Battle of Akroinon]], a decisive Byzantine victory, was during the final campaign of the Umayyad dynasty.<ref>*Eggenberger, David (1985).

[[Yazid III]] spoke out against his cousin Walid's \"immorality\" which included discrimination on behalf of the [[Qays and Yaman tribes|Banu Qays Arabs against Yemenis]] and [[Mawali|non-Arab Muslims]], and Yazid received further support from the Qadariya and Murji'iya (believers in human [[free will]]).<ref>von Ess, \"Kadar\", ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'' 2nd Ed.</ref> Walid was shortly thereafter deposed in a [[coup]].<ref>Theophilus.

He explained that he had rebelled on behalf of the Book of Allah and the Sunna. Yazid reigned for only six months, while various groups refused allegiance and dissident movements arose, after which he died. [[Ibrahim ibn al-Walid]], named heir apparent by his brother Yazid III, ruled for a short time in 744, before he abdicated. [[Marwan II]] ruled from 744 until he was killed in 750. He was the last Umayyad ruler to rule from Damascus. Marwan named his two sons Ubaydallah and Abdallah heirs. He appointed governors and asserted his authority by force. Anti-Umayyad feeling was very prevalent, especially in Iran and Iraq. The Abbasids had gained much support. Marwan's reign as caliph was almost entirely devoted to trying to keep the Umayyad empire together. His death signalled the end of Umayyad rule in the East, and was followed by the massacre of Umayyads by the Abbasids. Almost the entire Umayyad dynasty was killed, except for the talented prince [[Abd al-Rahman I|Abd al-Rahman]] who escaped to the Iberian Peninsula and founded a dynasty there.\n\n==Islamic Golden Age==\n{{Main|Islamic Golden Age}}\n\n=== Islamic world during the Abbasid Caliphate ===\n{{Main|Abbasid Caliphate|}}\n[[File:Abbasids850.png|thumb|Abbasid caliphate]]\nThe [[Abbasid]] dynasty rose to power in 750, consolidating the gains of the earlier [[Caliphate]]s.

Although the Umayyad family had been killed by the revolting Abbasids, one family member, [[Abd ar-Rahman I]], escaped to Spain and established an independent caliphate there in 756. In the [[Maghreb]], Harun al-Rashid appointed the Arab [[Aghlabid]]s as virtually autonomous rulers, although they continued to recognise central authority. Aghlabid rule was short-lived, and they were deposed by the [[Shiite]] [[Fatimid]] dynasty in 909. By around 960, the Fatimids had conquered Abbasid Egypt, building a capital there in 973 called \"''al-Qahirah''\" (meaning \"the planet of victory\", known today as [[Cairo]]).

The [[Mali Empire|Islamic kingdoms associated with Mali]] reached prominence in the 13th century.<ref>\"Islam\". Encyclopaedia of Islam Online</ref>\n\nThe Abbasids developed initiatives aimed at greater Islamic unity. Different sects of the Islamic faith and mosques, separated by doctrine, history, and practice, were pushed to cooperate. The Abbasids also distinguished themselves from the Umayyads by attacking the Umayyads' moral character and administration. According to [[Ira Lapidus]], \"The Abbasid revolt was supported largely by Arabs, mainly the aggrieved settlers of Marw with the addition of the Yemeni faction and their [[Mawali]]\".<ref>{{harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=54}}</ref> The Abbasids also appealed to non-Arab Muslims, known as ''mawali'', who remained outside the [[kinship]]-based society of the Arabs and were perceived as a lower class within the Umayyad empire. Islamic [[ecumenism]], promoted by the Abbasids, refers to the idea of unity of the ''[[Ummah]]'' in the literal meaning: that there was a single faith. Islamic philosophy developed as the [[Shariah]] was codified, and the four [[Madhabs]] were established. This era also saw the rise of classical [[Sufism]]. Religious achievements included completion of the canonical collections of [[Hadith]] of [[Sahih Bukhari]] and others.<ref>{{harvnb|Nasr|2003|p=121}}</ref> Islam recognized to a certain extent the validity of the [[Abrahamic religion]]s, the Quran identifying [[Judaism|Jews]], [[Christianity|Christian]]s, [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrians]], and \"[[Sabians|Sabi'un]]\" or \"baptists\" (usually taken as a reference to the [[Mandean]]s and related Mesopotamian groups) as \"[[people of the book]]\".

Al-Ma'mun extended the Abbasid empire's territory during his reign and dealt with rebellions.<ref>Hindu rebellions in Sindh were put down, and most of Afghanistan was absorbed with the surrender of the leader of Kabul. Mountainous regions of Iran were brought under a tighter grip of the central Abbasid government, as were areas of Turkestan. There were disturbances in Iraq during the first several years of Al-Ma'mun's reign. Egypt continued to be unquiet. Sindh was rebellious, but Ghassan ibn Abbad subdued it. An ongoing problem for Al-Ma'mun was the uprising headed by Babak Khorramdin. In 214 Babak routed a Caliphate army, killing its commander Muhammad ibn Humayd.</ref> Al-Ma'mun had been named governor of Khurasan by Harun, and after his ascension to power, the caliph named Tahir as governor of his military services in order to assure his loyalty. Tahir and his family became entrenched in Iranian politics and became powerful, frustrating Al-Ma'mun's desire to centralize and strengthen Caliphal power. The rising power of the [[Tahirid dynasty]] became a threat as Al-Ma'mun's own policies alienated them and other opponents.\n\nAl-Ma'mun worked to centralize power and ensure a smooth succession. Al-Mahdi proclaimed that the caliph was the protector of Islam against heresy, and also claimed the ability to declare orthodoxy. Religious scholars averred that Al-Ma'mun was overstepping his bounds in the ''[[Mihna]]'', the [[Abbasid inquisition]] which he introduced in 833 four months before he died.<ref>The Mihna subjected traditionalist scholars with social influence and intellectual quality to imprisonment, religious tests, and loyalty oaths. Al-Ma'mun introduced the Mihna with the intention to centralize religious power in the caliphal institution and test the loyalty of his subjects. The Mihna had to be undergone by elites, scholars, judges and other government officials, and consisted of a series of questions relating to theology and faith. The central question was about the state of the creation of the Qur'an: if the person interrogated stated he believed the Qur'an to be created, he was free to leave and continue his profession.</ref> The ''[[Ulama]]'' emerged as a force in Islamic politics during Al-Ma'mun's reign for opposing the inquisitions. The ''Ulema'' and the major Islamic law schools took shape in the period of Al-Ma'mun. In parallel, Sunnism became defined as a religion of laws. Doctrinal differences between Sunni and Shi'a Islam became more pronounced.\n\nDuring the Al-Ma'mun regime, [[List of border conflicts|border war]]s increased. Al-Ma'mun made preparations for a major campaign, but died while leading an expedition in [[Sardis]]. Al-Ma'mun gathered scholars of many religions at Baghdad, whom he treated well and with tolerance. He sent an emissary to the Byzantine Empire to collect the most famous manuscripts there, and had them translated into Arabic.<ref>Had he been victorious over the Byzantine Emperor, Al-Ma'mun would have made a condition of peace be that the emperor hand over of a copy of the \"Almagest\".</ref> His scientists originated [[alchemy]]. Shortly before his death, during a visit to Egypt in 832, the caliph ordered the breaching of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] to search for knowledge and treasure. Workers tunneled in near where tradition located the original entrance. Al-Ma'mun later died near Tarsus under questionable circumstances and was succeeded by his half-brother, [[Al-Mu'tasim]], rather than his son, Al-Abbas ibn Al-Ma'mun.\n\nAs Caliph, Al-Mu'tasim promptly ordered the dismantling of al-Ma'mun's military base at Tyana. He faced Khurramite revolts. One of the most difficult problems facing this Caliph was the ongoing uprising of Babak Khorramdin. Al-Mu'tasim overcame the rebels and secured a significant victory. [[Theophilos (emperor)|Byzantine emperor Theophilus]] launched an attack against Abbasid fortresses. Al-Mu'tasim sent Al-Afshin, who met and defeated Theophilus' forces at the [[Battle of Anzen]]. On his return he became aware of a serious military conspiracy which forced him and his successors to rely upon Turkish commanders and [[ghilman]] slave-soldiers (foreshadowing the [[Mamluk]] system). The Khurramiyyah were never fully suppressed, although they slowly declined during the reigns of succeeding Caliphs. Near the end of al-Mu'tasim's life there was an uprising in Palestine, but he defeated the rebels.\n\nDuring Al-Mu'tasim's reign, the Tahirid dynasty continued to grow in power. The Tahirids were exempted from many tribute and oversight functions. Their independence contributed to Abbasid decline in the east. Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim followed his half-brother al-Ma'mun. He continued his predecessor's support for the Islamic Mu'tazila sect, applying brutal torture against the opposition. Arab mathematician [[Al-Kindi]] was employed by Al-Mu'tasim and tutored the Caliph's son. Al-Kindi had served at the House of Wisdom and continued his studies in Greek geometry and algebra under the caliph's patronage.<ref>Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, History v. 32 \"The Reunification of the Abbasid Caliphate,\" SUNY, Albany, 1987; v. 33 \"Storm and Stress along the Northern frontiers of the Abbasid Caliphate,\" transl. C.E. Bosworth, SUNY, Albany, 1991</ref>\n\n[[Al-Wathiq]] succeeded his father. Al-Wathiq dealt with opposition in Arabia, Syria, Palestine and in Baghdad. Using a famous sword he personally joined the execution of the Baghdad rebels. The revolts were the result of an increasingly large gap between Arab populations and the Turkish armies. The revolts were put down, but antagonism between the two groups grew, as Turkish forces gained power. He also secured a captive exchange with the Byzantines. Al-Wathiq was a patron of scholars, as well as artists. He personally had musical talent and is reputed to have composed over one hundred songs.<ref>[[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] History v. 34 \"Incipient Decline,\" transl. Joel L. Kramer, SUNY, Albany, 1989. {{ISBN|0-88706-875-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88706-875-1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Great Mosque of Samarra.jpg|thumb|[[Malwiya|Minaret]] at the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]].]]\nWhen Al-Wathiq died of high fever, [[Al-Mutawakkil]] succeeded him. Al-Mutawakkil's reign is remembered for many reforms and is viewed as a golden age. He was the last great Abbasid caliph; after his death the dynasty fell into decline. Al-Mutawakkil ended the Mihna. Al-Mutawakkil built the [[Great Mosque of Samarra]]<ref>Its minarets were spiraling cones {{convert|55|m|ft}} high with a spiral ramp, and it had 17 aisles with walls paneled with mosaics of dark blue glass.</ref> as part of an extension of Samarra eastwards. During his reign, Al-Mutawakkil met famous Byzantine theologian [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Constantine the Philosopher]], who was sent to strengthen diplomatic relations between the Empire and the Caliphate by [[Michael III|Emperor Michael III]]. Al-Mutawakkil involved himself in religious debates, as reflected in his actions against minorities. The Sh\u012b\u02bbi faced repression embodied in the destruction of the [[Imam Husayn Shrine|shrine of Hussayn ibn \u02bbAl\u012b]], an action that was ostensibly carried out to stop pilgrimages. Al-Mutawakkil continued to rely on Turkish statesmen and slave soldiers to put down rebellions and lead battles against foreign empires, notably capturing Sicily from the Byzantines. Al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a Turkish soldier.\n\n[[Al-Muntasir]] succeeded to the Caliphate on the same day with the support of the Turkish faction, though he was implicated in the murder. The Turkish party had al-Muntasir remove his brothers from the line of succession, fearing revenge for the murder of their father. Both brothers wrote statements of abdication. During his reign, Al-Muntasir removed the ban on pilgrimage to the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn and sent Wasif to raid the Byzantines. Al-Muntasir died of unknown causes. The Turkish chiefs held a council to select his successor, electing [[Al-Musta'in]]. The Arabs and western troops from Baghdad were displeased at the choice and attacked. However, the Caliphate no longer depended on Arabian choice, but depended on Turkish support. After the failed Muslim campaign against the Christians, people blamed the Turks for bringing disaster on the faith and murdering their Caliphs. After the Turks besieged Baghdad, Al-Musta'in planned to abdicate to [[Al-Mu'tazz]] but was put to death by his order. Al-Mu'tazz was enthroned by the Turks, becoming the youngest Abbasaid Caliph to assume power.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; clear:left; width: 250px; margin-right:1em;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color: #f8eaba;\" | High Abbasids<br />Jurisprudence\n|-\n|{{center|''Four constructions of Islamite law''}}\n* [[Abu Hanifa]] (Iraq teacher)\n* [[Malik bin Anas]] (Medina Imam)\n* [[Muhammad ibn Idris ash-Shafi`i]] (Egyptian Iman)\n* [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] (Baghdad teacher)\n|-\n!style=\"background-color: #f8eaba;\" | Early Abbasids<br />Literature and Science\n|-\n|\n* [[Hunayn ibn Ishaq]], physician, Greek translator;\n* [[Ibn Fadlan]], explorer;\n* [[Al Battani]], astronomer;\n* [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|Tabari]], historian and theologian;\n* [[Al-Razi]], philosopher, medic, chemist;\n* [[Al-Farabi]], chemist and philosopher;\n* [[Abu Nasr Mansur]], mathematician;\n* [[Alhazen]], mathematician;\n* [[Al-Biruni]], mathematician, astronomer, physicist;\n* [[Omar Khayy\u00e1m]], poet, mathematician, and astronomer;\n* [[Mansur Al-Hallaj]], Sufism mystic, writer and teacher\n|}\nAl-Mu'tazz proved too apt a pupil of his Turkish masters, but was surrounded by parties jealous of each other. At [[Samarra]], the Turks were having problems with the \"Westerns\" (Berbers and [[Moor (people)|Moor]]s), while the Arabs and Persians at Baghdad, who had supported al-Musta'in, regarded both with equal hatred. Al-Mu'tazz put his brothers Al-Mu'eiyyad and Abu Ahmed to death. The ruler spent recklessly, causing a revolt of Turks, Africans, and Persians for their pay. Al-Mu'tazz was brutally deposed shortly thereafter. [[Al-Muhtadi]] became the next Caliph. He was firm and virtuous compared to the earlier Caliphs, though the Turks held the power. The Turks killed him soon after his ascension. [[Al-Mu'tamid]] followed, holding on for 23 years, though he was largely a ruler in name only. After the [[Zanj Rebellion]], Al-Mu'tamid summoned [[Al-Muwaffaq (vizier)|al-Muwaffak]] to help him. Thereafter, Al-Muwaffaq ruled in all but name. The [[Hamdanid dynasty]] was founded by [[Hamdan ibn Hamdun]] when he was appointed governor of [[Mardin]] in Anatolia by the Caliphs in 890. Al-Mu'tamid later transferred authority to his son, [[al-Mu'tadid]], and never regained power. The [[Tulunids]] became the first independent state in Islamic Egypt, when they broke away during this time.\n\nAl-Mu'tadid ably administered the Caliphate. Egypt returned to allegiance and Mesopotamia was restored to order. He was tolerant towards Shi'i, but toward the Umayyad community he was not so just. Al-Mu'tadid was cruel in his punishments, some of which are not surpassed by those of his predecessors. For example, the Kharijite leader at Mosul was paraded about Baghdad clothed in a robe of silk, of which Kharijites denounced as sinful, and then crucified. Upon Al-Mu'tadid's death, his son by a Turkish slave-girl, [[Al-Muktafi]], succeeded to the throne.\n\nAl-Muktafi became a favorite of the people for his generosity, and for abolishing his father's secret prisons, the terror of Baghdad. During his reign, the Caliphate overcame threats such as the [[Carmathians]]. <!-- prevailed more or less with the Byzantines, who were not slow to take advantage of the Caliphate's difficulties.what does this mean? hostilities do not prevail. one or the other combatants might. \"War was kept up with various fortune on both sides.\" Did the fortunes fund the war or did both sides have success?--> Upon Al-Muktafi's death, the vazir next chose [[Al-Muqtadir]]. Al-Muqtadir's reign was a constant succession of thirteen Vazirs, one rising on the fall or assassination of another. His long reign brought the Empire to its lowest ebb. Africa was lost, and Egypt nearly. Mosul threw off its dependence, and the Greeks raided across the undefended border. The East continued to formally recognise the Caliphate, including those who virtually claimed independence.\n\nAt the end of the Early Baghdad Abbasids period, Empress [[Zoe Karbonopsina]] pressed for an armistice with Al-Muqtadir and arranged for the ransom of the Muslim prisoner<ref>A sum of 120,000 golden pieces was paid for the freedom of the captives.</ref> while the Byzantine frontier was threatened by Bulgarians. This only added to Baghdad's disorder. Though despised by the people, Al-Muqtadir was again placed in power after upheavals. Al-Muqtadir was eventually slain outside the city gates, whereupon courtiers chose his brother [[al-Qahir]]. He was even worse. Refusing to abdicate, he was blinded and cast into prison.\n\nHis son [[Ar-Radi]] took over only to experience a cascade of misfortune. Praised for his piety, he became the tool of the de facto ruling Minister, [[Ibn Raik]] (''[[amir al-umara]]''; 'Amir of the Amirs'). Ibn Raik held the reins of government and his name was joined with the Caliph's in public prayers. Around this period, the [[Hanbali]]s, supported by popular sentiment, set up in fact a kind of 'Sunni inquisition'. Ar-Radi is commonly regarded as the last of the real Caliphs: the last to deliver orations at the Friday service, to hold assemblies, to commune with philosophers, to discuss the questions of the day, to take counsel on the affairs of State;  to distribute [[Alms and Almsgiving|alms]], or to temper the severity of cruel officers. Thus ended the Early Baghdad Abbasids.\n\nIn the late mid-930s, the [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshidids]] of Egypt carried the Arabic title \"Wali\" reflecting their position as governors on behalf of the Abbasids, The first governor ([[Muhammad bin Tughj Al-Ikhshid]]) was installed by the Abbasid Caliph. They gave him and his descendants the Wilayah for 30 years. The last name Ikhshid is Soghdian for \"prince\".\n\nAlso in the 930s, [['Imad al-Daula|\u2018Al\u012b ibn B\u016byah]] and his two younger brothers, [[Rukn al-Daula|al-Hassan]] and [[Mu'izz al-Daula|A\u1e25mad]] founded the [[Buyid dynasty|B\u016byid confederation]]. Originally a soldier in the service of the [[Ziyarids|Ziy\u0101r\u012bds]] of [[Tabaristan|\u1e6cabarist\u0101n]], \u2018Al\u012b was able to recruit an army to defeat a Turkish general from [[Baghdad]] named Y\u0101q\u016bt in 934. Over the next nine years the three brothers gained control of the remainder of the caliphate, while accepting the titular authority of the caliph in Baghdad. The B\u016byids made large territorial gains. [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Jibal]] were conquered. Central Iraq submitted in 945, before the B\u016byids took [[Kerman|Kerm\u0101n]] (967), [[Oman]] (967), the [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jaz\u012bra]] (979), \u1e6cabarist\u0101n (980), and [[Gorgan]] (981). After this the B\u016byids went into slow decline, with pieces of the confederation gradually breaking off and local dynasties under their rule becoming ''de facto'' independent.<ref>Examples of the former include the loss of [[Mosul]] in 990, and the loss of \u1e6cabarist\u0101n and Gurg\u0101n in 997. An example of the latter is the [[Kakuyids|Kak\u016byid]] dynasty of [[Isfahan|Isfah\u0101n]], whose fortunes rose with the decline of the B\u016byids of northern Iran.</ref>\n\n====Middle Baghdad Abbasids====\n''Early High Middle Ages''\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:800 height:75\nPlotArea = width:720 height:55 left:65 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\n\nColors =\n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) #\n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) #\n    id:span value:rgb(0.9,0.8,0.5) #\n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) #\n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) #\n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:940 till:1094\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:940\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:940\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:8 mark:(line, black) width:10 shift:(0,-3)\n\n  from:940  till:944 color:era shift:(0,9) text:[[Al-Muttaqi|Muttaqi]]\n  from:944  till:946 color:age shift:(0,-15) text:[[Al-Mustakfi|Mustakfi]]\n  from:946  till:974 color:era text:[[Al-Muti|Muti]]\n  from:974  till:991 color:age text:[[At-Ta'i|Ta'i]]\n  from:991  till:1031 color:era text:[[Al-Qadir|Qadir]]\n  from:1031 till:1075 color:age text:[[Al-Qa'im (caliph)|Qa'im]]\n  from:1075 till:1094 color:era text:[[Al-Muqtadi|Muqtadi]]\n</timeline>\n\n[[File:Dirham of al-Muttaqi.jpg|thumb|Dirham of Al-Muttaqi]]\nAt the beginning of the Middle Baghdad Abbasids, the Caliphate had become of little importance. The ''amir al-umara'' [[Bajkam]] contented himself with dispatching his secretary to Baghdad to assemble local dignitaries to elect a successor. The choice fell on [[Al-Muttaqi]]. Bajkam was killed on a hunting party by marauding Kurds. In the ensuing anarchy in Baghdad, Ibn Raik persuaded the Caliph to flee to Mosul where he was welcomed by the Hamdanids. They assassinated Ibn Raik. Hamdanid [[Nasir al-Dawla]] advanced on Baghdad, where mercenaries and well-organised Turks repelled them. Turkish general [[Tuzun (amir al-umara)|Tuzun]] became ''amir al-umara''. The Turks were staunch Sunnis. A fresh conspiracy placed the Caliph in danger. Hamdanid troops helped ad-Daula escape to Mosul and then to Nasibin. Tuzun and the Hamdanid were stalemated. Al-Muttaqi was at [[Raqqa]], moving to Tuzun where he was deposed. Tuzun installed the blinded Caliph's cousin as successor, with the title of [[Al-Mustakfi]]. With the new Caliph, Tuzun attacked the [[Buwayhid dynasty]] and the [[Hamdanids]]. Soon after, Tuzun died, and was succeeded by one of his generals, Abu Ja'far. The Buwayhids then attacked Baghdad, and Abu Ja'far fled into hiding with the Caliph. Buwayhid Sultan Muiz ud-Daula assumed command forcing the Caliph into abject submission to the Amir. Eventually, Al-Mustakfi was blinded and deposed. The city fell into chaos, and the Caliph's palace was looted.<ref>{{cite book | first = Harold | last = Bowen | title = The Life and Times of \u02bfAl\u00ed Ibn \u02bf\u00cds\u00e0: The Good Vizier | year = 1928 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TZM3AAAAIAAJ | page = 385}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left; clear:left; width: 250px; margin-right:1em;\"\n|-\n!style=\"background-color: #f8eaba;\" |Significant Middle Abbasid Muslims\n|-\n|\n* [[Ibn Rushd]] ([[Averroes]]), philosopher;\n* [[al-Farabi]], Persian (Soghdian) philosopher;\n* [[Al-Mutanebbi]], Arabic poet;\n* [[Ibn S\u012bn\u0101|Abu Ali Husain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina]] ([[Avicenna]]),  physician, philosopher, and scientist\n|}\nOnce the Buwayhids controlled Baghdad, [[Al-Muti]] became caliph. The office was shorn of real power and Shi'a observances were established. The Buwayhids held on Baghdad for over a century. Throughout the Buwayhid reign the Caliphate was at its lowest ebb, but was recognized religiously, except in [[Iberia]]. Buwayhid Sultan [[Mu'izz al-Dawla]] was prevented from raising a Shi'a Caliph to the throne by fear for his own safety, and fear of rebellion, in the capital and beyond.<ref>R. N. Frye (1975).

The Hideaway dynasyty also fractured. The Abbasid borders were the defended only by small border states. [[Baha' al-Dawla]], the Buyid amir of Iraq, deposed al-Ta'i in 991 and proclaimed [[al-Qadir]] the new caliph.<ref name=Hanne>{{cite book|last=Hanne|first=Eric, J.|title=Putting the Caliph in His Place: Power, Authority, and the Late Abbasid Caliphate|year=2007|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|isbn=9780838641132|pages=55}}</ref>\n\nDuring al-Qadir's Caliphate, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] looked after the empire. Mahmud of Ghazni, of Eastern fame, was friendly towards the Caliphs, and his victories in the Indian Empire were accordingly announced from the pulpits of Baghdad in grateful and glowing terms. Al-Qadir fostered the Sunni struggle against Shi\u02bfism and outlawed heresies such as the [[Baghdad Manifesto]] and the doctrine that the Quran was created. He outlawed the [[Mu\u02bftazila]], bringing an end to the development of rationalist Muslim philosophy. During this and the next period, [[Islamic literature]], especially [[Persian literature]], flourished under the patronage of the Buwayhids.<ref>[[William Muir]]. The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall.</ref> By 1000, the global Muslim population had climbed to about 4 percent of the world, compared to the Christian population of 10 percent.\n\nDuring [[Al-Qa'im (caliph)|Al-Qa'im]]'s reign, the Buwayhid ruler often fled the capital and the Seljuq dynasty gained power. [[Toghr\u00fcl]] overran Syria and Armenia. He then made his way into the Capital, where he was well-received both by chiefs and people. In [[Bahrain]], the Qarmatian state collapsed in [[Al-Hasa]].

The first Caliph was [[Al-Mustazhir]]. He was politically irrelevant, despite civil strife at home and the [[First Crusade]] in Syria. [[Raymond IV of Toulouse]] attempted to attack Baghdad, losing at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. The global Muslim population climbed to about 5 per cent as against the Christian population of 11 per cent by 1100. [[Jerusalem]] was captured by crusaders who massacred its inhabitants. Preachers travelled throughout the caliphate proclaiming the tragedy and rousing men to recover the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] from the ''[[Franks]]'' (European Crusaders). Crowds of exiles rallied for war against the [[infidel]]. Neither the Sultan nor the Caliph sent an army west.<ref>[[William Muir]], The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall.</ref>\n\n[[Al-Mustarshid]] achieved more independence while the sultan [[Mahmud II of Great Seljuq]] was engaged in war in the East.

Dubays was crushed by a Seljuq army under [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], founder of the [[Zengid dynasty]]. Mahmud's death was followed by a civil war between his son Dawud, his nephew Mas'ud and the atabeg Toghrul II. Zengi was recalled to the East, stimulated by the Caliph and Dubays, where he was beaten. The Caliph then laid siege to Mosul for three months without success, resisted by Mas'ud and Zengi. It was nonetheless a milestone in the caliphate's military revival.<ref>{{cite book|author=Martin Sicker|title=The Islamic World in Ascendancy: From the Arab Conquests to the Siege of Vienna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlWsMcwZ9vEC|date= 2000|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-96892-2}}</ref>\n\nAfter the siege of Damascus (1134),<ref>Jean Richard, The Latin kingdom of Jerusalem: Volume 1. 1979. p. 36.</ref> Zengi undertook [[Military history of the Crusader states#War with the Zengids|operations in Syria]].

Zengi, because of the murder of Dubays, set up a rival Sultanate. Mas'ud attacked; the Caliph and Zengi, hopeless of success, escaped to Mosul. The Sultan regained power, a council was held, the Caliph was deposed, and his uncle, son of [[Al-Muqtafi (Abbasid Caliph)|Al-Muqtafi]], appointed as the new Caliph. Ar-Rashid fled to [[Isfahan]] and was killed by Hashshashins.<ref>William Muir. book The Caliphate: Its Rise, Decline, and Fall, 1924.</ref>\n\nContinued disunion and contests between Seljuq Turks allowed al-Muqtafi to maintain control in Baghdad and to extend it throughout Iraq. In 1139, al-Muqtafi granted protection to the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorian]] patriarch [[Abdisho III]]. While the Crusade raged, the Caliph successfully defended Baghdad against Muhammad II of Seljuq in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1157)]]. The Sultan and the Caliph dispatched men in response to Zengi's appeal, but neither the Seljuqs, nor the Caliph, nor their Amirs, dared resist the Crusaders.\n\nThe next caliph, [[Al-Mustanjid]], saw [[Saladin]] extinguish the [[Fatimid dynasty]] after 260 years, and thus the Abbasids again prevailed. [[Al-Mustadi]] reigned when Saladin become the sultan of Egypt and declared allegiance to the Abbasids.\n\n[[An-Nasir]], \"''The Victor for the Religion of God''\", attempted to restore the Caliphate to its ancient dominant role. He consistently held Iraq from Tikrit to the Gulf without interruption. His forty-seven year reign was chiefly marked by ambitious and corrupt dealings with the Tartar chiefs, and by his hazardous invocation of the Mongols, which ended his dynasty. His son, [[Az-Zahir (Abbasid caliph)|Az-Zahir]], was Caliph for a short period before his death and An-Nasir's grandson, [[Al-Mustansir (caliph)|Al-Mustansir]], was made caliph.\n\nAl-Mustansir founded the [[Mustansiriya Madrasah]]. In 1236 [[\u00d6gedei Khan]] commanded to raise up [[Greater Khorasan|Khorassan]]<!-- what does \"to raise up\" mean here?--> and populated [[Herat]]. The Mongol military governors mostly made their camp in [[Mughan plain]], Azerbaijan. The rulers of [[Mosul]] and [[Cilician Armenia]] surrendered.

To the east, Mongol forces under [[Hulagu Khan]] swept through the [[Transoxiana]] and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]]. [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|Baghdad was sacked]] and the caliph deposed soon afterwards.

Crossing the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] (named after the General), it won a decisive victory in the summer of 711 when the Visigothic king [[Roderic]] was defeated and killed on July 19 at the [[Battle of Guadalete]].

Rahman I continued south through Palestine, the Sinai, and then into Egypt. Rahman I was one of several surviving Umayyad family members to make a perilous trek to Ifriqiya at this time. Rahman I and Bedr reached modern day Morocco near [[Ceuta]]. Next step would be to cross to sea to al-Andalus, where Rahman I could not have been sure whether he would be welcome. Following the [[Berber Revolt]] (740s), the province was in a state of confusion, with the [[Ummah]] torn by tribal dissensions among the Arabs and racial tensions between the Arabs and Berbers. Bedr lined up three Syrian commanders \u2013 [[Obeid Allah ibn Uthman]] and [[Abd Allah ibn Khalid]], both originally of Damascus, and Yusuf ibn Bukht of Qinnasrin and contacted al-Sumayl (then in [[Zaragoza]]) to get his consent, but al-Sumayl refused, fearing Rahman I would try to make himself emir. After discussion with Yemenite commanders, Rahman I was told to go to al-Andalus. Shortly thereafter, he set off with Bedr and a small group of followers for Europe. Abd al-Rahman landed at [[Almu\u00f1\u00e9car]] in al-Andalus, to the east of [[M\u00e1laga]].\n\nDuring his brief time in M\u00e1laga, he quickly amassed local support. News of the prince's arrival spread throughout the peninsula. In order to help speed his ascension to power, he took advantage of the feuds and dissensions. However, before anything could be done, trouble broke out in northern al-Andalus. Abd al-Rahman and his followers were able to [[Zaragoza#Moorish Saraqusta|control Zaragoza]]. Rahman I fought to rule al-Andalus in a battle at the [[Guadalquivir|Guadalquivir river]], just outside C\u00f3rdoba on the plains of Musarah (Battle of Musarah). Rahman I was victorious, chasing his enemies from the field with parts of their army. Rahman I marched into the capital, C\u00f3rdoba, fighting off a [[counterattack]], but negotiations ended the confrontation. After Rahman I consolidated power, he proclaimed himself the al-Andalus emir. Rahman I did not claim the Muslim caliph, though.<ref>This was likely because al-Andalus was a land besieged by many different loyalties, and the proclamation of caliph would have likely caused much unrest. Abd al-Rahman's progeny would, however, take up the title of caliph.</ref> The last step was to have al-Fihri's general, al-Sumayl, garroted in C\u00f3rdoba's jail. Al-Andalus was a [[wikt:safe haven|safe haven]] for the house of Umayya that managed to evade the Abbasids.<ref>Michael Hamilton Morgan.

Rahman I and his army confronted the Abbasids, killing most of the Abbasid army. The main Abbasid leaders were decapitated, their heads preserved in salt, with identifying tags pinned to their ears. The heads were bundled in a gruesome package and sent to the Abbasid caliph who was on pilgrimage at Mecca. Rahman I quelled repeated rebellions in al-Andalus. He began the building of the great mosque [cordova], and formed ship-yards along the coast; he is moreover said to have been the first to transplant the palm and the pomegranate into the congenial climate of Spain: and he encouraged science and literature in his states. He died on 29 September 788, after a reign of thirty-four years and one month.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ns5PAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA385|year=1839|publisher=C.

His successor [[Al-Hakam I]] came to power and was challenged by his uncles, other sons of Rahman I. One, Abdallah, went to the court of Charlemagne in [[Aix-la-Chapelle]] to negotiate for aid.

During the reign of his father, Mundhir I commanded military operations against the neighbouring Christian kingdoms and the Muladi rebellions. At his father's death, he inherited the throne. During his two-year reign, Mundhir I fought against [[Umar ibn Hafsun]]. He died in 888 at Bobastro, succeeded by his brother [[Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi]].\n\nUmawi showed no reluctance to dispose of those he viewed as a threat. His government was marked by continuous wars between Arabs, Berbers and Muladi. His power as emir was confined to the area of C\u00f3rdoba, while the rest had been seized by rebel families. The son he had designated as successor was killed by one of Umawi's brothers.

Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had by then all adopted Islam, and the major trading routes in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and the Red Sea came under the sway of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Caliphs]].

Suleiman I advanced deep into Hungary following the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526 \u2014 [[Siege of Vienna|reaching as far as the gates of Vienna]] thereafter, and signed a Franco-Ottoman alliance with [[Francis I of France]] against [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] 10 years later.

The Safavids were originally Sufi and Iran was Sunni.<ref>Peter B.

[[Zaydis]], the largest group amongst the Shia before the [[Safavid Dynasty]] were also forced to convert to the Twelver Shia. The [[Zaydis]] at that time used the Hanafi Fiqh, as did most Sunnis and there were good relations between them. [[Abu Hanifah]] and [[Zayd ibn Ali]] were also very good friends.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/><ref name=\"Arab-Israeli Conflict Page 917\"/><ref name=\"The Iraq Effect Page 91\"/>\n\nThe [[Safavids]] dynasty from [[Azarbaijan]] ruled from 1501 to 1736, and which established [[Twelver]] [[Shi'a]] Islam as the region's [[Safavid conversion of Iran from Sunnism to Shiism|official religion]] and united its provinces under a single sovereignty, thereby reigniting the [[History of Iran|Persian]] identity.\n{{clear|left}}\n[[File:Shah soleiman safavi.jpg|thumb|right|[[Suleiman I of Persia|Shah Suleiman I]] and his courtiers, [[Isfahan]], 1670.

Note the two [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] figures with their names at the top left.]]\nAlthough claiming to be the descendants of [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]], the Safavids were [[Sunni]] (the name \"Safavid\" comes from a Sufi order called ''Safavi''). Their origins go back to [[Firuz Shah Zarrinkolah]], a local dignitary from the north. During their rule, the Safavids recognized Twelver Shi'a Islam as the State religion, thus giving the region a separate identity from its Sunni neighbours.\n\nIn 1524, [[Tahmasp I]] acceded to the throne, initiating a revival of the arts. [[Persian carpet|Carpetmaking]] became a major industry. The tradition of [[Persian miniature]] painting in manuscripts reached its peak, until Tahmasp turned to strict religious observance in middle age, prohibiting the consumption of alcohol and [[hashish]] and removing [[casino]]s, [[tavern]]s and [[brothel]]s.  Tahmasp's nephew [[Ibrahim Mirza]] continued to patronize a last flowering of the arts until he was murdered, after which many artists were recruited by the Mughal dynasty.\n\nTahmasp's grandson, [[Shah Abbas I]], restored the shrine of the eighth Twelver Shi'a Imam, [[Ali al-Ridha]] at [[Mashhad]], and restored the dynastic shrine at [[Ardabil]]. Both shrines received jewelry, fine manuscripts and Chinese porcelains. Abbas moved the capital to [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], revived old ports, and established thriving trade with Europeans. Amongst Abbas's most visible cultural achievements was the construction of ''[[Naqsh-e Jahan Square]]'' (\"Design of the World\").

It was founded by the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] prince [[Babur]] in 1526 with the destruction of the [[Delhi sultanate]], placing its capital in [[Agra]]. Babur's death some years later and the indecisive rule of his son, [[Humayun]], brought instability to Mughal rule. The resistance of the [[Afghanistan|Afghani]] [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]], who administered a string of defeats to Humayun, weakened the empire. A year before his death, however, Humayun managed to recover much of the lost territories, leaving a substantial legacy for his son, the 13-year-old [[Akbar the Great|Akbar]] (later known as ''Akbar the Great''), in 1556.[[File:Taj Mahal (south view, 2006).jpg|right|thumb|The Taj Mahal]] Under Akbar, consolidation of the Mughal Empire occurred through both expansion and administrative reforms.  After Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan came to power.

Its decline in the early 18th century allowed India to be divided into smaller kingdoms and states. The Mughal dynasty was dissolved by the [[British Empire]] after the [[Indian rebellion of 1857]].<ref name=\"AHGC\"/><ref name = \"odpftr\"/> It left a lasting legacy on Indian culture and architecture. Famous buildings built by the Mughals, include: the [[Taj Mahal]], the [[Red Fort]], the [[Badshahi Mosque]], the [[Lahore Fort]], the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]] and the [[Agra Fort]]. During the empire's reign, Muslim communities flourished all over India, in [[Gujarat]], [[Bengal]] and [[Hyderabad district (India)|Hyderabad]]. Various Sufi orders from Afghanistan and Persia were active throughout the region. More than a quarter of the population converted to Islam.<ref name = \"odpftr\"/>\n\n== Modern period ==\nThe modern age brought technological and organizational changes to Europe while the Islamic region continued the patterns of earlier centuries. The European powers, and especially [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]], globalized economically and colonized much of the region.\n\n=== Ottoman Empire partition ===\n{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S29571, T\u00fcrkei, Dardanellen, MG-Stellung.jpg|thumb|Ottoman army in World War I]] \nBy the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman Empire had declined. The decision to back [[Germany]] in [[World War I]] meant they shared the [[Central Powers]]' defeat in that war. The defeat led to the overthrow of the Ottomans by Turkish nationalists led by the victorious general of the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]: [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]], who became known to his people as Atat\u00fcrk, \"Father of the Turks.\" Atat\u00fcrk was credited with renegotiating the [[treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) which ended Turkey's involvement in the war and establishing the modern [[Republic of Turkey]], which was recognized by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]]. Atat\u00fcrk went on to implement an ambitious program of modernization that emphasized economic development and [[secular]]ization. He transformed Turkish culture to reflect European laws, adopted [[Arabic numerals]], the [[Latin script]], separated the religious establishment from the state, and emancipated woman\u2014even giving them the right to vote in parallel with [[women's suffrage]] in the west.<ref>{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=961, 969}}</ref>\n\nFollowing World War I, the vast majority of former Ottoman territory outside of Asia Minor was handed over to the victorious European powers as [[protectorate]]s. During the war the Allies had promised the subject peoples independence in exchange for their assistance fighting the Turkish powers. To their dismay, they found that this system of \"protectorates\" was a smoke-screen for their continued subjugation by the British and the French. The struggles for independence from their Turkish overlords and the cooperation of partisan forces with the British were romanticized in the stories of British secret intelligence agent [[T. E. Lawrence]]\u2014later known as \"Lawrence of Arabia.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Bentley|Ziegler|2006|pp=971\u201372}}</ref> Ottoman successor states include today's [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], Egypt, Greece, Iraq, [[Israel]], Lebanon, [[Romania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Serbia]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], Turkey, Balkan states, North Africa and the north shore of the [[Black Sea]].<ref>{{harvnb|McNeill|Bentley|Christian|2005|p=1402}}</ref>\n\nMany Muslim countries sought to adopt European political organization and [[nationalism]] began to emerge in the Muslim world. Countries like Egypt, Syria and Turkey organized their governments and sought to develop national pride among their citizens. Other places, like Iraq, were not as successful due to a lack of unity and an inability to resolve age-old prejudices between Muslim sects and against non-Muslims.\n\nSome Muslim countries, such as Turkey and Egypt, sought to separate Islam from the secular government. In other cases, such as Saudi Arabia, the government brought out religious expression in the re-emergence of the puritanical form of Sunni Islam known to its detractors as [[Wahabism]], which found its way into the [[Saudi royal family]].\n{{See also|Ottoman Caliphate|Turkish War of Independence}}\n\n===Arab\u2013Israeli conflict===\n{{Main|Arab\u2013Israeli conflict}}\nThe Arab\u2013Israeli conflict spans about a century of political tensions and open hostilities. It involves the establishment of the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]] as a [[Jew]]ish [[nation state]], the consequent [[1948 Palestinian exodus|displacement]] of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]] and [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]], as well as the adverse relationship between the [[Arab]] states and the State of Israel (see related [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict]]). Despite at first involving only the Arab states bordering Israel, animosity has also developed between Israel and other predominantly [[Muslim world|Muslim states]].\n\nThe [[Six-Day War]] of June 5\u201310, 1967, was fought between [[Israel]] and the neighbouring states of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. The Arab countries closed the [[Suez canal]] and it was followed in May 1970 by the closure of the \"tapline\" from Saudi Arabia through Syria to Lebanon. These developments had the effect of increasing the importance of [[petroleum]] in [[Libya]], which is a short (and canal-free) shipping distance from Europe. In 1970, [[Occidental Petroleum]] broke with other oil companies and accepted the Arab demands for price increases.\n\nMany countries, individuals and [[non-governmental organizations]] elsewhere in the world feel involved in this conflict for reasons such as cultural and religious ties with Islam, [[Arab culture]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], [[Jewish culture]], or for ideological, [[human rights]], or strategic reasons.

Following the Revolution, and a new constitution was approved and a referendum established the government, electing Ruhollah Khomeini as [[Supreme Leader]]. During the following two years, liberals, leftists, and Islamic groups fought each other, and the Islamics captured power.\n\nThe development of the two opposite fringes, the [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam]] the Twelver Shia version and its reinforcement by the [[Iranian Revolution]] and the [[Salafi]] in Saudi Arabia, coupled with the [[Iran\u2013Saudi Arabia relations]] resulted in these governments using sectarian conflict to enhance their political interests.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Heather S.

Certain Iranian exiles also helped convince Saddam that if he invaded, the fledgling Islamic republic would quickly collapse.\n\nIn October 1973, a new war between Israel and its Muslim neighbors, known as the [[Yom Kippur War]], broke out just as the oil companies began meeting with [[OPEC]] leaders. OPEC had been emboldened by the success of [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat's]] campaigns and the war strengthened their unity. In response to the emergency resupply effort by the [[Western Bloc|West]] that enabled Israel to put up a resistance against the Egyptian and Syrian forces, the Arab world imposed the 1973 oil embargo against the United States and Western Europe. Faisal agreed that Saudi Arabia would use some of its oil wealth to finance the \"front-line states\", those that bordered Israel, in their struggle. The centrality of petroleum, the [[Arab-Israeli Conflict]] and political and economic instability and uncertainty remain constant features of the politics of the region.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|History of Islam}}\n*[[Islam by country]] \u2013 a list\n*[[List of the Muslim Empires]]\n*[[Political aspects of Islam]]\n*[[Islamism]]\n*[[Islam and secularism]]\n*[[Pre-Islamic Arabia]]\n*[[The Ottomans: Europe's Muslim Emperors]]\n*[[History of the Balkans]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n'''Books, articles, and journals'''\n*{{Cite book| last=Armstrong | first=Karen | authorlink=Karen Armstrong | title=Islam: A Short History | publisher=Modern Library | year=2000 | isbn=978-0-679-64040-0 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book| last=Berkey| first=Jonathan Porter | authorlink=Jonathan Berkey | title=The Formation of Islam: Religion and Society in the Near East, 600\u20131800| publisher=Cambridge University Press | year=2003 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book|last1=Bloom |last2=Blair|title=Islam:A Thousand Years of Faith and Power|year=2000 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book| last=Esposito | first=John | authorlink=John Esposito | year=2000 | title=Oxford History of Islam | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-19-510799-9 |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite encyclopedia| last = Donner| first=Fred M.| entry=Modern approaches to early Islamic history |title=The New Cambridge History of Islam| pages=625\u201347 |volume=Volume 1: The Formation of the Islamic World, Sixth to Eleventh Centuries |publisher=Cambridge University Press |ref=harv |year=2010 |isbn=9780521838238 |editor-last=Robinson | editor-first=Chase F.}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Hart|first=Michael|title=The 100:Ranking of the most influential persons in history| publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location=New York |year=1978|isbn = 978-0-8065-1057-6  |ref=harv}}\n*{{Cite book| authors=P.

This empire reached its height during the mid-14th century BC under [[Suppiluliuma I]], when it encompassed an area that included most of Anatolia as well as parts of the northern [[Levant]] and [[Upper Mesopotamia]].\n\nBetween the 15th and 13th centuries BC the Empire of Hattusa, conventionally called the Hittite Empire, came into conflict with the [[Egyptian Empire]], [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] and the empire of the [[Mitanni]] for control of the [[Near East]]. The [[Assyria]]ns eventually emerged as the dominant power and annexed much of the Hittite empire, while the remainder was sacked by [[Phrygia]]n newcomers to the region. After c. 1180 BC, during the [[Bronze Age collapse]], the Hittites splintered into several independent \"[[Neo-Hittite]]\" city-states, some of which survived until the 8th century BC before succumbing to the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]].\n\nThe [[Hittite language]] was a distinct member of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian branch]] of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] family, and along with the related [[Luwian language]], is the oldest historically attested [[Indo-European language]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leidenuniv.nl/en/researcharchive/index.php3-c=178.htm|title=2006-05-02 Hittite|date=7 July 2004|publisher=}}</ref> Hittites referred to their native language as {{transl|hit|''ne\u0161ili''}} \"in the language of [[K\u00fcltepe|Nesa]]\" but called their native land as ''Kingdom of [[Hattusa]]'' (Hatti in Akkadian). The conventional name \"Hittites\" is due to their initial identification with the [[Biblical Hittites]] in 19th century [[archaeology]]. Despite their use of the name [[Hattusa]] for their state, the Hittites should be distinguished from the [[Hattians]], an earlier people who inhabited the region of Hattusa (until the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC) and spoke an unrelated language known as [[Hattic language|Hattic]].<ref>Ardzinba, Vladislav.

Ethnic Hittite dynasties survived in small kingdoms scattered around modern [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]] and [[Israel]].

Introduction</ref> Sayce and other scholars also noted that Judah and the Hittites were never enemies in the Hebrew texts; in the [[Books of Kings|Book of Kings]], they supplied the Israelites with cedar, chariots, and horses, and in the [[Book of Genesis]] were a friend and ally to [[Abraham]].

In 1887, excavations at [[Amarna]] in [[Egypt]] uncovered the diplomatic correspondence of Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]] and his son, [[Akhenaten]]. Two of the letters from a \"kingdom of ''Kheta''\"\u2014apparently located in the same general region as the Mesopotamian references to \"land of ''Hatti''\"\u2014were written in standard Akkadian cuneiform, but in an unknown language; although scholars could read it, no one could understand it. Shortly after this, [[Archibald Sayce]] proposed that ''Hatti'' or ''Khatti'' in Anatolia was identical with the \"kingdom of ''Kheta''\" mentioned in these [[Egypt]]ian texts, as well as with the biblical Hittites. Others, such as [[Max M\u00fcller]], agreed that ''Khatti'' was probably ''Kheta'', but proposed connecting it with Biblical [[Kittim]] rather than with the [[Biblical Hittites]]. Sayce's identification came to be widely accepted over the course of the early 20th century; and the name \"Hittite\" has become attached to the civilization uncovered at Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n[[Image:Sphinx_Gate,_Hattusa_01.jpg|thumb|Sphinx Gate entrance at [[Hattusa]].]]\n\nDuring sporadic excavations at Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y ([[Hattusa]]) that began in 1906, the archaeologist [[Hugo Winckler]] found a royal archive with 10,000 tablets, inscribed in cuneiform Akkadian and the same unknown language as the Egyptian letters from ''Kheta''\u2014thus confirming the identity of the two names. He also proved that the ruins at Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y were the remains of the capital of an empire that, at one point, controlled northern Syria.\n\nUnder the direction of the [[German Archaeological Institute]], excavations at Hattusa have been under way since 1907, with interruptions during the world wars. K\u00fcltepe was successfully excavated by Professor [[Tahsin \u00d6zg\u00fc\u00e7]] from 1948 until his death in 2005. Smaller scale excavations have also been carried out in the immediate surroundings of Hattusa, including the rock sanctuary of [[Yaz\u0131l\u0131kaya]], which contains numerous [[rock relief]]s portraying the Hittite rulers and the gods of the Hittite pantheon.\n\n===Writings===\nThe Hittites used a variation of cuneiform called [[Hittite cuneiform]]. Archaeological expeditions to [[Hattusa]] have discovered entire sets of royal archives on cuneiform tablets, written either in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], the diplomatic language of the time, or in the various dialects of the Hittite confederation.<ref>''The Hittite Empire''.

After Hattusa was made capital, the area encompassed by the bend of the [[K\u0131z\u0131l\u0131rmak River]] (Hittite ''Marassantiya'') was considered the core of the Empire, and some Hittite laws make a distinction between \"this side of the river\" and \"that side of the river\". For example, the reward for the capture of an escaped slave after he managed to flee beyond the Halys is higher than that for a slave caught before he could reach the river.\n\nTo the west and south of the core [[territory]] lay the region known as ''[[Luwians|Luwiya]]'' in the earliest Hittite texts. This terminology was replaced by the names [[Arzawa]] and [[Kizzuwatna]] with the rise of those kingdoms.<ref>''A Short Grammar of Hieroglyphic Luwian'', John Marangozis (2003)</ref> Nevertheless, the Hittites continued to refer to the language that originated in these areas as [[Luwian language|Luwian]]. Prior to the rise of [[Kizzuwatna]], the heart of that territory in [[Cilicia]] was first referred to by the Hittites as [[Adana|Adaniya]].<ref>Beal, Richard H, \"The History of Kizzuwatna and the Date of the \u0160una\u0161\u0161ura Treaty\", ''Orientalia'' 55 (1986) pp. 424ff.</ref> Upon its revolt from the Hittites during the reign of [[Ammuna]],<ref>Beal.

To the north, lived the mountainous people called the [[Kaskians]]. To the southeast of the Hittites lay the Hurrian empire of [[Mitanni]]. At its peak, during the reign of [[Mur\u0161ili II]], the Hittite empire stretched from [[Arzawa]] in the west to [[Mitanni]] in the east, many of the Kaskian territories to the north including [[Hayasa-Azzi]] in the far north-east, and on south into [[Canaan]] approximately as far as the southern border of [[Lebanon]], incorporating all of these territories within its domain.\n\n==History<!--'History of the Hittites' redirects here-->==\n\n[[File:IE expansion.png|300px|thumb|right|Map of Indo-European migrations from {{circa|4000}} to 1000 BC according to the Kurgan model.

[[Huzziya I]], descendant of a Huzziya of Zalpa, took over Hatti.

Hattusili I campaigned as far as the Semitic [[Amorite]] kingdom of [[Yamkhad]] in [[Syria]], where he attacked, but did not capture, its capital of [[Aleppo]]. Hattusili I did eventually capture Hattusa and was credited for the foundation of the Hittite Empire. According to ''The Edict of Telepinu'', which dates back to the 16th century BC, \"Hattusili was king, and his sons, brothers, in-laws, family members, and troops were all united. Wherever he went on campaign he controlled the enemy land with force. He destroyed the lands one after the other, took away their power, and made them the borders of the sea. When he came back from campaign, however, each of his sons went somewhere to a country, and in his hand the great cities prospered. But, when later the princes\u2019 servants became corrupt, they began to devour the properties, conspired constantly against their masters, and began to shed their blood.\u201d This excerpt from the edict is supposed to illustrate the unification, growth, and prosperity of the Hittites under his rule. It also illustrates the corruption of \"the princes\" who are believed to be his sons. The corruption is dealt with, however, the lack of sources leads to uncertainty with how the corruption was dealt with. On Hattusili I's deathbed, he chose his grandson, Mursuli I, as his heir.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ancient.eu/hittite/|title=The Hittites|last=Mark|first=Joshua |date=28 April 2011 |website= |accessdate=9 May 2017}}</ref> [[Mursili I]] conquered that city in a campaign conducted against the [[Amorites]] in 1595 BC (middle chronology). Also in 1595 BC, Mursili I (or Murshilish I) conducted a great raid down the Euphrates River, bypassing [[Assyria]] and captured [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and [[Babylonia]], ejecting the [[Amorite]] founders of the Babylonian state in the process. However, the Hittite campaigns caused internal dissension which forced a withdrawal of troops to the Hittite homelands. Throughout the remainder of the 16th century BC, the Hittite kings were held to their homelands by dynastic quarrels and warfare with the [[Hurrians]]\u2014their neighbours to the east.<ref name=\"Roebuck 93\">{{cite book|title=The World of Ancient Times|last=Roebuck|first=Carl|publisher=Charles Schibner's Sons|year=1966|location=New York|page=93}}</ref> Also the campaigns into Amurru (modern Syria) and southern Mesopotamia may be responsible for the reintroduction of [[cuneiform]] writing into Anatolia, since the Hittite script is quite different from the script of the preceding Assyrian Colonial period.\n\nMursili continued the conquests of Hattusili I. Mursili's conquests reached southern [[Mesopotamia]] and even ransacked [[Babylon]] itself in 1531 BC (short chronology).<ref name=\"Gurney 23\">{{cite book |first=O. R. |last=Gurney |title=The Hittites |publisher=Penguin Books |location=Baltimore, Maryland |year=1966 |page=23}}</ref> Rather than incorporate Babylonia into Hittite domains, Mursili seems to have instead turned control of Babylonia over to his [[Kassites|Kassite]] allies, who were to rule it for the next four centuries. This lengthy campaign, however, strained the resources of Hatti, and left the capital in a state of near-anarchy. Mursili was assassinated shortly after his return home, and the Hittite Kingdom was plunged into chaos. The [[Hurrians]] (under the control of an [[Indo-Aryan Mitanni]] ruling class), a people living in the mountainous region along the upper [[Tigris River|Tigris]] and [[Euphrates River|Euphrates]] rivers in modern south east Turkey, took advantage of the situation to seize Aleppo and the surrounding areas for themselves, as well as the coastal region of Adaniya, renaming it [[Kizzuwatna]] (later [[Cilicia]]).\n\nFollowing this, the Hittites entered a weak phase of obscure records, insignificant rulers, and reduced area of control. This pattern of expansion under strong kings followed by contraction under weaker ones, was to be repeated over and over again throughout the Hittite Kingdom's 500-year history, making events during the waning periods difficult to reconstruct with much precision. The political instability of these years of the Old Hittite Kingdom, can be explained in part by the nature of the Hittite kingship at that time. During the Old Hittite Kingdom period prior to 1400 BC, the king of the Hittites was not viewed by the Hittite citizenry as a \"living god\", like the [[Pharaoh]]s of Egypt, but rather as a first among equals.<ref name=\"Roebuck 94\" /> Only in the later period of the Hittite Empire, from 1400 BC until 1200 BC, did the kingship of the Hittites become more centralized and powerful. Also in earlier years the succession was not legally fixed, enabling the [[Wars of the Roses|\"war of the Roses\"]] style rivalries between northern and southern branches.\n\nThe next monarch of any note following Mursili I was [[Telepinu]] (c. 1500 BC), who won a few victories to the southwest, apparently by allying himself with one Hurrian state ([[Kizzuwatna]]) against another ([[Mitanni]]). Telepinu also attempted to secure the lines of succession.<ref>Fortanini, 115-6.</ref>\n\n===Middle Kingdom===\n[[File:Yazilikaya_B_12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|left|Twelve Hittite gods of the Underworld in the nearby [[Yaz\u0131l\u0131kaya]], a sanctuary of [[Hattusa]]]]\nThe last monarch of the Old kingdom, Telepinu, reigned until about 1500 BC.

The capital once again went on the move, first to [[Sapinuwa]] and then to [[Samuha]]. There is an archive in Sapinuwa but it has not been adequately translated to date.\n\nIt segues into the \"Hittite Empire period\" proper, which dates from the reign of [[Tudhaliya I]] from c. 1430 BC.\n\nOne innovation that can be credited to these early Hittite rulers is the practice of conducting treaties and alliances with neighboring states; the Hittites were thus among the earliest known pioneers in the art of international politics and diplomacy. This is also when the Hittite religion adopted several gods and rituals from the Hurrians.\n\n===New Kingdom===\n[[File:Hattusa,_capital_of_the_Hittite_Empire_38.jpg|thumb|Tudhaliya IV (relief in [[Hattusa]])]]\n[[File:Ankara_Muzeum_B19-45.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hittite monument, an exact replica of monument from Fas\u0131llar in [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], [[Ankara]].]]\nWith the reign of [[Tudhaliya I]] (who may actually not have been the first of that name; see also [[Tudhaliya]]), the Hittite Kingdom re-emerged from the fog of obscurity. Hittite civilization entered the period of time called the \"Hittite Empire period\". Many changes were afoot during this time, not the least of which was a strengthening of the kingship. Settlement of the Hittites progressed in the Empire period.<ref name=\"Roebuck 94\" /> However, the Hittite people tended to settle in the older lands of south Anatolia rather than the lands of the Aegean. As this settlement progressed, treaties were signed with neighboring peoples.<ref name=\"Roebuck 94\">{{cite book |first=Carl |last=Roebuck |title=The World of Ancient Times |page=94}}</ref> During the Hittite Empire period the kingship became hereditary and the king took on a \"superhuman aura\" and began to be referred to by the Hittite citizens as \"My Sun\". The kings of the Empire period began acting as a high priest for the whole kingdom\u2014making an annual tour of the Hittite holy cities, conducting festivals and supervising the upkeep of the sanctuaries.<ref name=\"Roebuck 94\" />\n\nDuring his reign (c. 1400 BC), King Tudhaliya I, again allied with [[Kizzuwatna]], then vanquished the Hurrian states of [[Aleppo]] and Mitanni, and expanded to the west at the expense of [[Arzawa]] (a [[Luwian]] state).\n\nAnother weak phase followed Tudhaliya I, and the Hittites' enemies from all directions were able to advance even to Hattusa and raze it. However, the Kingdom recovered its former glory under [[Suppiluliuma I]] (c. 1350 BC), who again conquered [[Aleppo]], Mitanni was reduced to vassalage by the Assyrians under his son-in-law, and he defeated [[Carchemish]], another Amorite city-state. With his own sons placed over all of these new conquests, [[Babylonia]] still in the hands of the allied [[Kassites]], this left Suppiluliuma the supreme power broker in the known world, alongside [[Assyria]] and [[Egypt]], and it was not long before Egypt was seeking an alliance by marriage of another of his sons with the widow of [[Tutankhamen]]. Unfortunately, that son was evidently murdered before reaching his destination, and this alliance was never consummated. However, the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1365\u20131050 BC) once more began to grow in power also, with the ascension of [[Ashur-uballit I]] in 1365 BC. Ashur-uballit I attacked and defeated [[Shattiwaza|Mattiwaza]] the [[Mitanni]] king despite attempts by the Hittite king [[Suppiluliumas I]], now fearful of growing Assyrian power, attempting to preserve his throne with military support. The lands of the [[Mitanni]] and [[Hurrians]] were duly appropriated by Assyria, enabling it to encroach on Hittite territory in eastern [[Asia Minor]], and [[Adad-nirari I]] annexed [[Carchemish]] and north east Syria from the control of the Hittites.<ref name=Roux>{{cite book |first=Georges |last=Roux |title=Ancient Iraq}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Suppiluliumas I]], and a very brief reign by his eldest son, another son, [[Mursili II]] became king (c. 1330). Having inherited a position of strength in the east, Mursili was able to turn his attention to the west, where he attacked Arzawa and a city known as Millawanda ([[Miletus]]) which was under the control of [[Ahhiyawa]]. More recent research based on new readings and interpretations of the Hittite texts, as well as of the material evidence for Mycenaean contacts with the Anatolian mainland, came to the conclusion that ''Ahhiyawa'' referred to [[Mycenaean Greece]], or at least to a part of it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Windle|first=Joachim Latacz|title=Troy and Homer: Towards a Solution of an Old Mystery|year=2004|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-926308-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ccQIyA9CW-wC|ref=harv|pages=121\u2013122}}; {{cite book|last=Bryce|first=Trevor|title=The Kingdom of the Hittites|year=1999|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-924010-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Agg5-lpVI2MC|ref=harv|page=60}}.{{cite book|last1=Beckman|first1=Gary M.|last2=Bryce|first2=Trevor R.|last3=Cline|first3=Eric H.|title=Writings from the Ancient World: The Ahhiyawa Texts|year=2012|location=Atlanta|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|url=http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/061528P.front.pdf|issn=1570-7008|ref=harv|page=6|quote=At the very least, perhaps we can say that the Ahhiyawa Problem/Question has been solved and answered after all, for there is now little doubt that Ahhiyawa was a reference by the Hittites to some or all of the Bronze Age Mycenaean world.}}</ref>\n\n====Battle of Kadesh====\n[[File:Ramses IIs seger \u00f6ver Chetafolket och stormningen av Dapur, Nordisk familjebok.png|thumb|Egyptian pharaoh [[Ramesses II]] storming the Hittite fortress of [[Siege of Dapur|Dapur]].]]\n{{Main|Battle of Kadesh}}\nHittite prosperity was mostly dependent on control of the trade routes and metal sources.

In response to increasing Assyrian annexation of Hittite territory, he concluded a peace and alliance with [[Rameses II]] (also fearful of Assyria), presenting his daughter's hand in marriage to the Pharaoh.<ref name=\"Gurney 36\" /> The \"Treaty of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]\", one of the oldest completely surviving treaties in history, fixed their mutual boundaries in southern Canaan, and was signed in the 21st year of Rameses (c. 1258 BC).

He even temporarily annexed the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] island of [[Cyprus]], before that too fell to Assyria. The very last king, [[Suppiluliuma II]] also managed to win some victories, including a naval battle against [[Alashiya]] off the coast of Cyprus.<ref name=\"naval\">Horst Nowacki, Wolfgang Lef\u00e8vre ''Creating Shapes in Civil and Naval Architecture: A Cross-Disciplinary Comparison'' BRILL, 2009 {{ISBN|9004173455}}</ref> But the Assyrians, under [[Ashur-resh-ishi I]] had by this time annexed much Hittite territory in Asia Minor and Syria, driving out and defeating the [[Babylonia]]n king [[Nebuchadnezzar I]] in the process, who also had eyes on Hittite lands.

This left the Hittite homelands vulnerable to attack from all directions, and [[Hattusa]] was burnt to the ground sometime around 1180 BC following a combined onslaught from new waves of invaders, the [[Kaskas]], [[Phrygians]] and [[Bryges]].

In that year, the Assyrian king [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] was defeating the ''[[Mushku]]'' ([[Phrygians]]) who had been attempting to press into Assyrian colonies in southern Anatolia from the Anatolian highlands, and the [[Kaskians|Kaska]] people, the Hittites' old enemies from the northern hill-country between Hatti and the Black Sea, seem to have joined them soon after. The Phrygians had apparently overrun [[Cappadocia]] from the West, with recently discovered epigraphic evidence confirming their origins as the Balkan \"Bryges\" tribe, forced out by the Macedonians.\n\nAlthough the Hittite kingdom disappeared from Anatolia at this point, there emerged a number of so-called [[Neo-Hittite]] kingdoms in Anatolia and northern Syria. They were the successors of the Hittite Kingdom. The most notable Syrian Neo-Hittite kingdoms were those at [[Carchemish]] and [[Milid]] (near the later [[Melitene]]). These Neo-Hittite Kingdoms gradually fell under the control of the [[Neo Assyrian Empire]] (911\u2013608 BC). Carchemish and Milid were made vassals of Assyria under [[Shalmaneser III]] (858\u2013823 BC), and fully incorporated into Assyria during the reign of [[Sargon II]] (722\u2013705 BC).\n\nA large and powerful state known as [[Tabal]] occupied much of southern Anatolia.

The usage of the term Kattaha over Hannikkun, according to Ronald Gorny (head of the Alisar regional project in Turkey), was a device to downgrade the Pre-Hittite identity of this female deity, and to bring her more in touch with the Hittite tradition. Their reconfiguration of Gods throughout their early history such as with Kattaha was a way of legitimizing their authority and to avoid conflicting ideologies in newly included regions and settlements. By transforming local deities to fit their own customs, the Hittites hoped that the traditional beliefs of these communities would understand and accept the changes to become better suited for the Hittite political and economic goals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorny|first=Ronald|date=Fall 1995|title=Hittite Imperialism and Anti-Imperial Resistance As Viewed from Ali\u0219ar H\u00f6y\u00fck|jstor=1357346|journal=The Archaeology of Empire in Ancient Anatolia|volume=299/300|pages=69\u201370}}</ref>\n\n===Political dissent in the Old Kingdom===\nIn 1595 BC, King Marsilis I ({{reign|1556|1526}} BC) marched into the city of Babylon and sacked the city.

On his journey back to Hattusa he was assassinated by his brother-in-law Hantili I who then took the throne. Hantili was able to escape multiple murder attempts on himself, however, his family did not. His wife, Harapsili and her son were murdered. In addition, other members of the royal family were killed by Zindata I who was then murdered by his own son, Ammunna. All of the internal unrest among the Hittite royal family led to a decline of power.

Within this edict, he designated the pankus, which was a \"general assembly\", that acted as a high court. Crimes such as murder were observed and judged by the Pankus. Kings were also subject to jurisdiction under the Pankus. The Pankus also served as an advisory council for the king.

For example, in cases of thievery, the punishment of that crime would to be to repay what was stolen in equal value.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heritageinstitute.com/zoroastrianism/ranghaya/hittites.htm#governance |title=Hittites|last=Eduljee|first=|date=5 May 2017|website=Heritage Institute|accessdate=5 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Language==\n{{Indo-European topics}}\n{{Main|Hittite language}}\n[[File:Hattusa_Bronze_Tablet_Cuneiform.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Bronze tablet from \u00c7orum-Bo\u011fazk\u00f6y dating from 1235 BC. Photographed at [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], [[Ankara]].]]\n\nThe Hittite language is recorded fragmentarily from about the 19th century BC (in the [[K\u00fcltepe]] texts, see ''[[Ishara]]''). It remained in use until about 1100 BC. Hittite is the best attested member of the [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] branch of the [[Indo-European language family]], and the Indo-European language for which the earliest surviving written attestation exists.\n\nThe language of the Hattusa tablets was eventually deciphered by a [[Czechs|Czech]] linguist, [[Bedrich Hrozny|Bed\u0159ich Hrozn\u00fd]] (1879\u20131952), who, on 24 November 1915, announced his results in a lecture at the Near Eastern Society of Berlin. His book about the discovery was printed in [[Leipzig]] in 1917, under the title ''The Language of the Hittites; Its Structure and Its Membership in the Indo-European Linguistic Family''.<ref>Hrozn\u00fd, Bed\u0159ich, ''Die Sprache der Hethiter: ihr Bau und ihre Zugeh\u00f6rigkeit zum indogermanischen Sprachstamm: ein Entzifferungsversuch'' (Leipzig, Germany: J.C. Hinrichs, 1917).</ref> The preface of the book begins with:\n\n:\"The present work undertakes to establish the nature and structure of the hitherto mysterious language of the Hittites, and to decipher this language [...] It will be shown that Hittite is in the main an Indo-European language.\"\n\nThe decipherment famously led to the confirmation of the [[laryngeal theory]] in Indo-European linguistics, which had been predicted several decades before. Due to its marked differences in its structure and phonology, some early [[philology|philologists]], most notably [[Warren Cowgill]] had even argued that it should be classified as a sister language to Indo-European languages ([[Indo-Hittite]]), rather than a daughter language. By the end of the Hittite Empire, the Hittite language had become a written language of administration and diplomatic correspondence. The population of most of the Hittite Empire by this time spoke [[Luwian]] dialects, another Indo-European language of the Anatolian family that had originated to the west of the Hittite region.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nAccording to [[Craig Melchert]], the current tendency is to suppose that Proto-Indo-European evolved, and that the \"prehistoric speakers\" of Anatolian became isolated \"from the rest of the PIE speech community, so as not to share in some common innovations.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Melchert|2012|p=7}}.</ref> Hittite, as well as its [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] cousins, split off from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] at an early stage, thereby preserving archaisms that were later lost in the other Indo-European languages.<ref>{{harvnb|Jasanoff|2003|p=20 with footnote 41}}</ref>\n\nIn Hittite there are many loanwords, particularly religious vocabulary, from the non-Indo-European [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]] and [[Hattic language|Hattic]] languages. The latter was the language of the [[Hattians]], the local inhabitants of the land of [[Hattians|Hatti]] before being absorbed or displaced by the Hittites. Sacred and magical texts from [[Hattusa]] were often written in Hattic, [[Hurrian]], and [[Luwian language|Luwian]], even after Hittite became the norm for other writings.\n\n==Art==\n[[File:Eflatunpinar.jpg|thumb|Monument over a spring at [[Eflatun P\u0131nar]]]]\n{{main|Hittite art}}\nGiven the size of the empire, there are relatively few remains of Hittite art. These include some impressive monumental carvings, a number of [[rock relief]]s, as well as metalwork, in particular the [[Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck bronze standards]], carved ivory, and ceramics, including the [[H\u00fcseyindede vases]].  The Sphinx Gates of [[Alaca H\u00f6y\u00fck]] and [[Hattusa]], with the monument at the spring of [[Eflatun P\u0131nar]], are among the largest constructed sculptures, along with a number of large recumbent lions, of which the [[Lion of Babylon (statue)|''Lion of Babylon'']] statue at [[Babylon]] is the largest, if it is indeed Hittite. Unfortunately, nearly all are notably worn.  Rock reliefs include the [[Hanyeri relief]], and [[Hemite relief]].  The [[Ni\u011fde Stele]] is a [[Neo-Hittite]] monument from the modern Turkish city of [[Ni\u011fde]], which dates from the end of the 8th century BC.\n\n==Religion and mythology==\n[[File:Museum_of_Anatolian_Civilizations027.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Stag statuette, symbol of a Hittite male god in [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], [[Ankara]]. This figure is used for the [[Hacettepe University]] emblem.]]\n{{Main|Hittite mythology}}\nHittite religion and mythology were heavily influenced by their [[Hittite empire|Hattic]], [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian]], and [[Hurrians#Religion|Hurrian]] counterparts. In earlier times, [[Indo-European mythology|Indo-European]] elements may still be clearly discerned.\n\n[[Weather god|Storm gods]] were prominent in the Hittite pantheon. [[Tarhunt]] ([[Hurrian]]'s Teshub) was referred to as 'The Conqueror', 'The king of Kummiya', 'King of Heaven', 'Lord of the land of Hatti'. He was chief among the gods and his [[symbol]] is the bull. As Teshub he was depicted as a bearded man astride two mountains and bearing a club. He was the god of battle and victory, especially when the conflict involved a foreign power.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~chris.s/hittite-ref.html|author=Siren, Christopher B.|title='Hittite/Hurrian Mythology REF 1.2', ''Myths and Legends''|website=Comcast.net}}</ref> Teshub was also known for his conflict with the serpent [[Illuyanka]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0KXABAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT32&ots=wxPLvtPDsf&dq=Teshub%20Illuyanka&pg=PT32#v=onepage&q=Teshub%20Illuyanka&f=false|title=A Brief Guide to the Greek Myths|last=Kershaw|first=Stephen P.|date=7 February 2013 |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=9781472107541|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Law==\nHittite laws, much like other records of the empire, are recorded on [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] tablets made from baked clay.  What is understood to be the Hittite Law Code comes mainly from two clay tablets, each containing 186 articles, and are a [[Codification (law)|collection of practiced laws]] from across the early Hittite Kingdom.<ref name=\":43\">{{Cite journal|last=Ta\u015f|first=\u0130lknur|last2=Dinler|first2=Veysel|date=2015-01-01|title=Hittite Criminal Law in the Light of Modern Paradigms: Searching for the traces of Modernday Criminal Law in the Past|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312373101_Hittite_Criminal_Law_in_the_Light_of_Modern_Paradigms_Searching_for_the_traces_of_Modernday_Criminal_Law_in_the_Past|journal=ARAMAZD ARMENIAN JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES|volume=9|pages=73\u201390}}</ref> In addition to the tablets, monuments bearing Hittite cuneiform inscriptions can be found in central [[Anatolia]] describing the government and law codes of the empire.<ref name=\":52\">{{Cite web|url=https://www-jstor-org.libproxy.nau.edu/stable/3140922?seq=5#page_scan_tab_contents|title=The Hittite Inscriptions|last=Sayce|first=A.

These changes could possibly be attributed to the rise of new and different kings throughout the history empire or to the new translations that change the language used in the law codes.<ref name=\":13\" /> In either case, the law codes of the Hittites provide very specific fines or punishments that are to be issued for specific crimes<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":33\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/796081940|title=A reader of ancient Near Eastern texts : sources for the study of the Old Testament|last=David.|first=Coogan, Michael|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195324921|location=New York|oclc=796081940}}</ref> and have many similarities to Biblical laws found in the books of Exodus and [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]].<ref name=\":33\" /> In addition to criminal punishments, the law codes also provide instruction on certain situations such as inheritance and death.\n\n=== Use of laws ===\n\nThe law articles used by the Hittites most often outline very specific crimes or offenses, either against the state or against other individuals, and provide a sentence for these offenses. The laws carved in the tablets are an assembly of established social conventions from across the empire. Hittite laws at this time have a prominent lack of equality in punishments In many cases, distinct punishments or compensations for men and women are listed.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":33\" /> Free men most often received more compensation for offenses against them than free women did. Slaves, male or female, had very little rights, and could easily be punished or executed by their masters for crimes.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":33\" /> Most articles describe destruction of property and personal injury, to which the most common sentence was payment for compensation of the lost property. Again, in these cases men often times receive a greater amount of compensation than women.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":33\" /> Other articles describe how marriage of slaves and free individuals should be handled. In any case of separation or estrangement, the free individual, male or female, would keep all but one child that resulted from the marriage.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":33\" /> Another thing to note is that homosexuality is not mentioned in any of the law articles of the Hittite Empire.<ref name=\":43\"/>\n\nCases in which capital punishment is recommended in the articles most often seem to come from pre-reform sentences for severe crimes and prohibited sexual pairings. Many of these cases include public torture and execution as punishment for serious crimes against religion. Most of these sentences would begin to go away in the later stages of the Hittite Empire as major law reforms began to occur.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":43\"/>\n\n=== Law reform ===\nWhile different translations of laws can be seen throughout the history of the empire,<ref name=\":23\" /> the Hittite outlook of law was originally founded on religion and were intended to preserve the authority of the state.<ref name=\":43\"/> Additionally, punishments had the goal of crime prevention and the protection of individual property rights.<ref name=\":43\" /> The goals of crime prevention can be seen in the severity of the punishments issued for certain crimes. Capital punishment and torture are specifically mentioned as punishment for more severe crimes against religion and harsh fines for the loss of private property of life. The tablets also describe the ability of the king to pardon certain crimes, but specifically prohibit an individual being pardoned for murder.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":13\" />\n\nAt some point in the 16th or 15th century BC, Hittite law codes move away from torture and capital punishment and to more humanitarian forms of punishments, such as fines.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":13\" /> Where the old law system was based on retaliation and retribution for crimes, the new system saw punishments that were much more mild, favoring monetary compensation over physical or capital punishment.<ref name=\":43\"/> Why these drastic reforms happened is not exactly clear, but it is likely that punishing murder with execution was deemed not to benefit any individual or family involved.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":13\" /> These reforms were not just seen in the realm of capital punishment. Where major fines were to be paid, a severe reduction in penalty can be seen. For example, prior to these major reforms, the payment to be made for the theft of an animal was thirty times the animal's value; after the reforms, the penalty was reduced to half the original fine. Simultaneously, attempts to modernize the language and change the verbiage used in the law codes can be seen during this period of reform.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":23\" />\n\n===Examples of laws===\nUnder both the old and reformed Hittite law codes, three main types of punishment can be seen: Death, torture, or compensation/fines.<ref name=\":43\"/> The articles outlined on the cuneiform tablets provide very specific punishments for crimes committed against the Hittite religion or against individuals. In many, but not all cases, articles describing similar laws are grouped together. More than a dozen consecutive articles describe what are known to be permitted and prohibited sexual pairings.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":33\" /> These pairings mostly describe men (sometimes specifically referred to as free men, sometimes just men in general)<ref name=\":33\" /> having relations, be it consensual or not, with animals, step-family, relatives of spouses, or concubines.<ref name=\":43\"/> Many of these articles do not provide specific punishments but, prior to the law reforms, crimes against religion were most often punishable by death. These include incestuous marriages and sexual relations with certain animals.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":33\" /> For example, one article states, \"If a man has sexual relations with a cow, it is an unpermitted sexual pairing: he will be put to death.\"<ref name=\":33\" /> Similar relations with horses and mules were not subject to capital punishment, but the offender could not become a priest afterword.<ref name=\":43\"/><ref name=\":13\" /> Actions at the expense of other individuals most often see the offender paying some sort of compensation, be it in the form money, animals, or land. These actions could include the destruction of farmlands, death or injury of livestock, or assault of an individual.<ref name=\":33\" /> Several articles also specifically mention acts of the gods. If an animal were to die by certain circumstances, the individual could claim that it died by the hand of a god. Swearing that what they claim was true, it seems that they were exempt from paying compensation to the animal's owner.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":33\" /> Injuries inflicted upon animals owned by another individual are almost always compensated with either direct payment, or trading the injured animal with a healthy one owned by the offender.<ref name=\":33\" />\n\nNot all laws prescribed in the tablets deal with criminal punishment. For example, the instructions of how the marriage of slaves and division of their children are given in a group of articles, \"The slave woman shall take most of the children, with the male slave taking one child.\"<ref name=\":33\" /> Similar instructions are given to the marriage of free individuals and slaves. Other actions include how breaking of engagements are to be handled.<ref name=\":13\" /><ref name=\":33\" />\n\n==Biblical Hittites==\n{{Main|Biblical Hittites}}\n\nThe [[Bible]] refers to \"Hittites\" in several passages, ranging from Genesis to the post-Exilic [[Ezra\u2013Nehemiah]]. Genesis 10 (the [[Generations of Noah]]) links them to an eponymous ancestor Heth, a descendant of [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] through his son, [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]]. The Hittites are thereby counted among the Canaanites. The Hittites are usually depicted as a people living among the Israelites\u2014Abraham purchases the Patriarchal burial-plot of Machpelah from \"Ephron HaChiti\", Ephron the Hittite; and Hittites serve as high military officers in [[David]]'s army. In 2 Kings 7:6, however, they are a people with their own kingdoms (the passage refers to \"kings\" in the plural), apparently located outside geographic Canaan, and sufficiently powerful to put a Syrian army to flight.<ref>King James Bible, 2 Kings 7:6: For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, Lo, the king of Israel hath hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.</ref>\n\nIt is a matter of considerable scholarly debate whether the biblical \"Hittites\" signified any or all of: 1) the original [[Hattians]]; 2) their Indo-European conquerors, who retained the name \"Hatti\" for Central Anatolia, and are today referred to as the \"Hittites\" (the subject of this article); or 3) a Canaanite group who may or may not have been related to either or both of the Anatolian groups, and who also may or may not be identical with the later [[Syro-Hittite states]].<ref name=\"Woudstra1981\">{{cite book|last=Woudstra|first=Marten|authorlink=Marten Woudstra|title=The Book of Joshua|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfG1svPVYyQC&pg=PA60|year=1981|publisher=Wm.

Endocrine glands are the cardinal example, but specialized cells in various other organs also secrete hormones. Hormone secretion occurs in response to specific biochemical signals from a wide range of regulatory systems. For instance, [[serum calcium]] concentration affects [[parathyroid hormone]] synthesis; [[blood sugar]] (serum glucose concentration) affects [[insulin]] synthesis; and because the outputs of the [[stomach]] and exocrine [[pancreas]] (the amounts of [[gastric juice]] and [[pancreatic juice]]) become the input of the [[small intestine]], the small intestine secretes hormones to stimulate or inhibit the stomach and pancreas based on how busy it is. Regulation of hormone synthesis of [[sex steroid|gonadal hormones]], [[adrenocortical hormone]]s, and [[thyroid hormone]]s is often dependent on complex sets of direct influence and feedback interactions involving the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis|hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal]] (HPA), [[hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis|-gonadal]] (HPG), and [[hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis|-thyroid]] (HPT) axes.\n\nUpon secretion, certain hormones, including protein hormones and catecholamines, are water-soluble and are thus readily transported through the circulatory system. Other hormones, including steroid and thyroid hormones, are lipid-soluble; to allow for their widespread distribution, these hormones must bond to [[carrier plasma glycoprotein]]s (e.g., [[thyroxine-binding globulin]] (TBG)) to form [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]-protein complexes. Some hormones are completely active{{define}} when released into the bloodstream (as is the case for insulin and growth hormones), while others are [[prohormone]]s that must be activated in specific cells through a series of activation steps that are commonly highly regulated. The [[endocrine system]] [[secrete]]s hormones directly into the [[circulatory system|bloodstream]], typically via [[Capillary#Types|fenestrated capillaries]], whereas the [[exocrine system]] secretes its hormones indirectly using [[Duct (anatomy)|ducts]]. Hormones with [[paracrine]] function diffuse through the [[Interstitial fluid|interstitial space]]s to nearby target tissue.\n\n== Introduction/Overview ==\n{{further|Signal transduction}}\n\nHormonal signaling involves the following steps:<ref name=Nussey_Whitehead_2001>{{cite book|vauthors=Nussey S, Whitehead S | title=Endocrinology: an integrated approach|year = 2001 | publisher = Bios Scientific Publ. | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-1-85996-252-7 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22/ }}</ref>\n# '''[[Biosynthesis]]''' of a particular hormone in a particular tissue\n# '''Storage and [[Cellular secretion|secretion]]''' of the hormone\n# '''Transport''' of the hormone to the target cell(s)\n# '''Recognition''' of the hormone by an [[membrane protein|associated cell membrane]] or [[intracellular]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] protein\n# '''Relay and amplification''' of the received hormonal signal via a [[signal transduction]] process: This then leads to a cellular response. The reaction of the target cells may then be recognized by the original hormone-producing cells, leading to a [[down-regulation]] in hormone production. This is an example of a [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[negative feedback loop]].\n# '''Breakdown''' of the hormone.\n\nHormone producing cells are typically of a specialized cell type, residing within a particular [[endocrine system|endocrine gland]], such as the [[thyroid gland]], [[ovary|ovaries]], and [[testes]]. Hormones exit their cell of origin via [[exocytosis]] or another means of [[cell membrane|membrane transport]]. The hierarchical model is an oversimplification of the hormonal signaling process. Cellular recipients of a particular hormonal signal may be one of several cell types that reside within a number of different tissues, as is the case for [[insulin]], which triggers a diverse range of systemic physiological effects. Different tissue types may also respond differently to the same hormonal signal.\n\n== Regulation ==\n\nThe rate of hormone biosynthesis and secretion is often regulated by a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] [[negative feedback]] control mechanism. Such a mechanism depends on factors that influence the [[metabolism]] and [[excretion]] of hormones. Thus, higher hormone concentration alone cannot trigger the negative feedback mechanism. Negative feedback must be triggered by overproduction of an \"effect\" of the hormone.\n\nHormone secretion can be stimulated and inhibited by:\n* Other hormones (''stimulating''- or ''releasing'' -hormones)\n* Plasma concentrations of ions or nutrients, as well as binding [[globulin]]s\n* [[Neuron]]s and mental activity\n* Environmental changes, e.g., of light or temperature\n\nOne special group of hormones is the [[tropic hormone]]s that stimulate the hormone production of other [[endocrine system|endocrine glands]].  For example, [[thyroid-stimulating hormone]] (TSH) causes growth and increased activity of another endocrine gland, the [[thyroid]], which increases output of [[thyroid hormone]]s.\n\nTo release active hormones quickly into the [[Circulatory system|circulation]], hormone biosynthetic cells may produce and store biologically inactive hormones in the form of [[prehormone|pre-]] or [[prohormone]]s. These can then be quickly converted into their active hormone form in response to a particular stimulus.\n\n[[Eicosanoid]]s are considered to act as local hormones. They are considered to be \"local\" because they possess specific effects on target cells close to their site of formation. They also have a rapid degradation cycle, making sure they do not reach distant sites within the body.<ref>\"Eicosanoids\". www.rpi.edu.

The transduction pathway ends (3) with transcription factors being activated in the nucleus, and protein synthesis beginning. In both diagrams, a is the hormone, b is the cell membrane, c is the cytoplasm, and d is the nucleus.]] Most hormones initiate a cellular response by initially binding to either [[membrane protein|cell membrane associated]] or [[intracellular]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s. A cell may have several different receptor types that recognize the same hormone but activate different [[signal transduction]] pathways, or a cell may have several different receptors that recognize different hormones and activate the same biochemical pathway.\n\nReceptors for most [[peptide hormone|peptide]] as well as many [[eicosanoid]] hormones are embedded in the [[plasma membrane]] at the surface of the cell and the majority of these receptors belong to the [[G protein-coupled receptor]] (GPCR) class of seven [[alpha helix]] [[transmembrane]] proteins.  The interaction of hormone and receptor typically triggers a cascade of secondary effects within the [[cytoplasm]] of the cell, described as [[signal transduction]], often involving [[phosphorylation]] or dephosphorylation of various other cytoplasmic proteins, changes in [[ion channel]] permeability, or increased concentrations of intracellular molecules that may act as [[second messenger|secondary messengers]] (e.g., [[cyclic AMP]]). Some [[protein hormone]]s also interact with [[intracellular]] receptors located in the [[cytoplasm]] or [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] by an [[intracrine]] mechanism.\n\nFor [[steroid hormone|steroid]] or [[thyroid hormone|thyroid]] hormones, their [[steroid hormone receptor|receptors]] are located [[intracellular|inside the cell]] within the [[cytoplasm]] of the target cell. These receptors belong to the  [[nuclear receptor]] family of ligand-activated [[transcription factor]]s. To bind their receptors, these hormones must first cross the cell membrane. They can do so because they are lipid-soluble. The combined hormone-receptor [[protein complex|complex]] then moves across the nuclear membrane into the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to specific [[DNA sequences]], regulating the expression of certain [[genes]], and thereby increasing the levels of the proteins encoded by these genes.<ref name=beato>{{cite journal |vauthors=Beato M, Chavez S, Truss M | title = Transcriptional regulation by steroid hormones | journal = Steroids | year=1996 | volume=61 | issue=4 | pages=240\u2013251 | pmid = 8733009 | doi = 10.1016/0039-128X(96)00030-X}}</ref> However, it has been shown that not all steroid receptors are located inside the cell.

Local preparations for use in [[otolaryngology]] often contain [[pharmacology|pharmacologic]] equivalents of [[adrenaline]], while [[steroid]] and [[vitamin D]] creams are used extensively in [[dermatology|dermatological]] practice.\n\nA \"pharmacologic dose\" or \"supraphysiological dose\" of a hormone is a medical usage referring to an amount of a hormone far greater than naturally occurs in a healthy body. The effects of pharmacologic doses of hormones may be different from responses to naturally occurring amounts and may be therapeutically useful, though not without potentially adverse side effects. An example is the ability of pharmacologic doses of [[glucocorticoid]]s to suppress [[inflammation]].\n\n== Hormone-behavior interactions ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nAt the neurological level, behavior can be inferred based on: hormone concentrations; hormone-release patterns; the numbers and locations of hormone receptors; and the efficiency of hormone receptors for those involved in gene transcription. Not only do hormones influence behavior, but also behavior and the environment influence hormones. Thus, a feedback loop is formed. For example, behavior can affect hormones, which in turn can affect behavior, which in turn can affect hormones, and so on.\n\nThree broad stages of reasoning may be used when determining hormone-behavior interactions:\n* The frequency of occurrence of a hormonally dependent behavior should correspond to that of its hormonal source\n* A hormonally dependent behavior is not expected if the hormonal source (or its types of action) is non-existent\n* The reintroduction of a missing behaviorally dependent hormonal source (or its types of action) is expected to bring back the absent behavior\n\n== Comparison with neurotransmitters ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nThere are various clear distinctions between hormones and [[neurotransmitter]]s:\n* A hormone can perform functions over a larger spatial and temporal scale than can a neurotransmitter.\n* Hormonal signals can travel virtually anywhere in the circulatory system, whereas neural signals are restricted to pre-existing nerve tracts\n* Assuming the travel distance is equivalent, neural signals can be transmitted much more quickly (in the range of milliseconds) than can hormonal signals (in the range of seconds, minutes, or hours). Neural signals can be sent at speeds up to 100 meters per second.\n* Neural signalling is an all-or-nothing (digital) action, whereas hormonal signalling is an action that can be continuously variable as dependent upon hormone concentration.\n\n==Binding proteins==\nHormone transport and the involvement of binding proteins is an essential aspect when considering the function of hormones. There are several benefits with the formation of a complex with a binding protein: the effective half-life of the bound hormone is increased; a reservoir of bound hormones is created, which evens the variations in concentration of unbound hormones (bound hormones will replace the unbound hormones when these are eliminated).<ref>Boron WF, Boulpaep EL.

Hanert{{sfn|Bush|Kassel|2006|p=168}} and first manufactured in 1935.{{sfn|Corbin|2006|p=151}} Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding [[#Drawbars|drawbars]] to specify a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal [[tonewheel]] near an [[electromagnetic pickup]], and then strengthening the signal with an [[Power amplifier|amplifier]] so it can drive a [[speaker enclosure|speaker cabinet]]. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the [[Leslie speaker]].\n\nThe organ was originally marketed and sold by the Hammond Organ Company to [[Church (building)|churches]] as a lower-cost alternative to the wind-driven [[pipe organ]], or instead of a [[piano]]. It quickly became popular with professional [[jazz]] musicians in [[organ trio]]s, a small group centered on the Hammond organ. Organ trios were hired by [[jazz club]] owners, who found that organ trios were a much cheaper alternative to hiring a [[big band]]. [[Jimmy Smith (musician)|Jimmy Smith]]'s use of the Hammond B-3, with its additional harmonic percussion feature, inspired a generation of organ players, and its use became more widespread in the 1960s and 1970s in [[rhythm and blues]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[reggae]], as well as being an important instrument in [[progressive rock]].\n\nThe Hammond Organ Company struggled financially during the 1970s, as they abandoned tonewheel organs and switched to manufacturing instruments using [[integrated circuits]]. These instruments were not as popular with musicians as the tonewheels had been, and the company went out of business in 1985. The Hammond name was purchased by the [[Suzuki Musical Instrument Corporation]], which proceeded to manufacture digital simulations of the most popular tonewheel organs. This culminated in the production of the \"New B-3\" in 2002, which provided an accurate recreation of the original B-3 organ using modern digital technology.\n\nHammond-Suzuki continues to manufacture a variety of organs for both professional players and churches. Other companies, such as [[Korg]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland]], and [[Clavia]], have also achieved success in providing more lightweight and portable [[Clonewheel organ|emulations]] of the original tonewheel organs. The sound of a tonewheel Hammond can also be emulated using modern software such as [[Native Instruments]] B4.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Features==\nA number of distinctive Hammond organ features are not usually found on other keyboards like the [[piano]] or [[synthesizer]]. Some are similar to a [[pipe organ]], but others are unique to the instrument.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=34}}\n\n===Keyboards and pedalboard===\n[[File:Hammond B2 (closeup).jpg|thumb|right|200px|The two manuals of the Hammond B-2.]]\n{{Listen\n| filename=Drawbar C Chord.ogg\n| title=C Note\n| description=A single note ([[C (musical note)|C]]) played on a Hammond organ\n| format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:Hammond C2 pedalboards (Supernatural).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Unlike an [[American Guild of Organists]] pedalboard, a console Hammond normally has 25 pedals.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=76}}]]\nMost Hammond organs have two 61-note (five-[[octave]]) keyboards called [[manual (music)|manuals]]. As with [[pipe organ]] keyboards, the two manuals are arrayed on two levels close to each other. Each is laid out in a similar manner to a piano keyboard, except that pressing a key on a Hammond results in the sound continuously playing until it is released, whereas with a piano, the note's volume decays. No difference in volume occurs regardless of how heavily or lightly the key is pressed (unlike with a piano), so overall volume is controlled by a pedal (also known as a \"swell\" or \"expression\" pedal).{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=33-34}} The keys on each manual have a lightweight [[Action (piano)|action]], which allows players to perform rapid passages more easily than on a piano. In contrast to piano and pipe organ keys, Hammond keys have a flat-front profile, commonly referred to as \"waterfall\" style. Early Hammond console models had sharp edges, but starting with the B-2, these were rounded, as they were cheaper to manufacture.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=50}} The M series of spinets also had waterfall keys (which has subsequently made them ideal for spares on B-3s and C-3s{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=89}}), but later spinet models had \"diving board\" style keys which resembled those found on a church organ.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintageorganparts.com/organ-keys.html|title=Organ Keys|publisher=Vintage Organ Parts|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}</ref> Modern Hammond-Suzuki models use waterfall keys.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hammondorganco.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/web-SKseries-BROCHURE.pdf |title=SK Series Brochure|publisher=Hammond USA|accessdate=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHammond console organs come with a wooden [[pedal keyboard|pedalboard]] played with the feet, for bass notes. Most console Hammond pedalboards have 25 notes, with the bottom note a low C and the top note a [[C (musical note)|middle C]] two octaves higher. Hammond used a 25-note pedalboard because he found that on traditional 32-note pedalboards used in church pipe organs, the top seven notes were seldom used. The Hammond Concert models E, RT, RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 had 32-note [[American Guild of Organists]] (AGO) pedalboards going up to the [[G (musical note)|G]] above middle C as the top note.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=76}} The RT-2, RT-3 and D-100 also contained a separate solo pedal system that had its own volume control and various other features.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=58}} Spinet models have 12- or 13-note miniature pedalboards.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=76}}\n\n===Drawbars===\n[[File:Hammond-drawbars-plain.svg|thumb|The sound on a Hammond is varied using drawbars, similar to faders on an [[Mixing console|audio mixing board]]{{sfn|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=447}}]]\nThe sound on a tonewheel Hammond organ is varied through the manipulation of drawbars. A drawbar is a metal slider that controls the volume of a particular sound component, in a similar way to a fader on an [[Mixing console|audio mixing board]]. As a drawbar is incrementally pulled out, it increases the volume of its sound. When pushed all the way in, the volume is decreased to zero.{{sfn|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=447}}\n\nThe labeling of the drawbar derives from the [[Organ stop|stop]] system in pipe organs, in which the physical length of the pipe corresponds to the pitch produced. Most Hammonds contain nine drawbars per manual. The drawbar marked \"8\u2032\" generates the [[fundamental frequency|fundamental]] of the note being played, the drawbar marked \"16\u2032\" is an octave below, and the drawbars marked \"4\u2032\", \"2\u2032\" and \"1\u2032\" are one, two and three octaves above, respectively. The other drawbars generate various other [[harmonics]] and  [[subharmonics]] of the note.<ref name=\"robjohns\"/> While each individual drawbar generates a relatively pure sound similar to a flute or electronic oscillator, more complex sounds can be created by mixing the drawbars in varying amounts.{{sfn|Browne|Browne|2001|p=361}}\n\nSome drawbar settings have become well-known and associated with certain musicians. A very popular setting is 888000000 (i.e., with the drawbars labelled \"16\u2032\", \"{{frac|5|1|3}}\u2032\" and \"8\u2032\" fully pulled out), and has been identified as the \"classic\" Jimmy Smith sound.<ref name=\"spark\"/>\n\n===Presets===\n[[File:Hammond preset keys.jpg|thumb|left|Preset keys on a Hammond organ are reverse-colored and sit to the left of the [[manual (music)|manuals]]]]\nIn addition to drawbars, many Hammond tonewheel organ models also include presets, which make predefined drawbar combinations available at the press of a button. Console organs have one octave of reverse colored keys (naturals are black, sharps and flats are white) to the left of each manual, with each key activating a preset; the far left key (C), also known as the cancel key, de-activates all presets, and results in no sound coming from that manual. The two right-most preset keys (B and B{{music|flat}}) activate the corresponding set of drawbars for that manual, while the other preset keys produce preselected drawbar settings that are internally wired into the preset panel.<ref>\n{{cite AV media\n| title=Inside of Hammond Organ\n| url=http://www.theatreorgans.com/hammond/ABACK.JPG\n| medium=photograph\n| publisher=TheatreOrgans.com\n}}</ref>\n\n===Vibrato and chorus===\nHammond organs have a built-in [[vibrato]] effect that provides a small variation in pitch while a note is being played, and a [[chorus effect]] where a note's sound is combined with another sound at a slightly different and varying pitch. The best known vibrato and chorus system consists of six settings, V1, V2, V3, C1, C2 and C3 (i.e., three each of vibrato and chorus), which can be selected via a rotary switch. Vibrato / chorus can be selected for each manual independently.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=52}}\n\n===Harmonic percussion===\nThe B-3 and C-3 models introduced the concept of \"Harmonic Percussion\", which was designed to emulate the percussive sounds of the [[harp]], [[xylophone]], and [[marimba]].{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=53}} When selected, this feature plays a decaying second- or third-harmonic [[overtone]] when a key is pressed. The selected percussion harmonic fades out, leaving the sustained tones the player selected with the drawbars. The volume of this percussive effect is selectable as either normal or soft.{{sfn|Clark|1999|p=47}} Harmonic Percussion retriggers only after all notes have been released, so legato passages sound the effect only on the very first note or chord, making Harmonic Percussion uniquely a \"single-trigger, polyphonic\" effect.<ref name=\"reid200401\">{{cite journal\n| last       = Reid |first=Gordon\n| title      = Synthesizing tonewheel organs\n| url        = http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jan04/articles/synthsecrets.htm\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827225557/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov03/articles/synthsecrets.htm\n| archivedate= August 27, 2008\n| publisher  = Sound On Sound\n| date       = January  2004\n| accessdate = July 30, 2013\n}}</ref>\n\n===Start and run switches===\n[[File:Hammond B-3 START-RUN.jpg|thumb|upright|170px|Console Hammond organs such as the B-3 require two switches; \"Start\" to drive the [[starter motor]] and \"Run\" to drive the main tonewheel generator.]]\nBefore a Hammond organ can produce sound, the motor that drives the tonewheels must come up to speed. On most models, starting a Hammond organ involves two switches. The \"Start\" switch turns a dedicated [[starter motor]], which must run for about 12 seconds. Then, the \"Run\" switch is turned on for about four seconds. The \"Start\" switch is then released, whereupon the organ is ready to generate sound.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=69}} The H-100 and E-series consoles and L-100 and T-100 spinet organs, however, had a self-starting motor that required only a single \"On\" switch.{{sfn|Vail|2002|pages=83,87}} A [[pitch bend]] effect can be created on the Hammond organ by turning the \"Run\" switch off and on again. This briefly cuts power to the generators, causing them to run at a slower pace and generate a lower pitch for a short time. Hammond's New B3 contains similar switches to emulate this effect, though it is a digital instrument.<ref name=\"robjohns\"/>{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=369}}\n\n==History==\n<!--[[File:Hammond RT.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hammond organ, concert model RT-2. Manufactured between 1949 and 1955 by Hammond Instrument Co.]]-->\nThe Hammond organ's technology derives from the [[Telharmonium]], an instrument created in 1897 by [[Thaddeus Cahill]]. The telharmonium used revolving electric [[alternator]]s which generated tones that could be transmitted over wires. The instrument was bulky, because the alternators had to be large enough to generate high [[voltage]] for a loud enough signal. The Hammond organ solved this problem by using an [[amplifier]].{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=36}}\n\nLaurens Hammond graduated from [[Cornell University]] with a [[mechanical engineering]] degree in 1916. By the start of the 1920s, he had designed a spring-driven clock, which provided enough sales for him to start his own business, the [[Hammond Clock Company]], in 1928. As well as clocks, his early inventions included [[3D viewer|three-dimensional glasses]] and an automatic [[contract bridge|bridge]] table shuffler.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=55}} However, as the [[Great Depression]] continued into the 1930s, sales of the bridge table declined and he decided to look elsewhere for a commercially successful product. Hammond was inspired to create the [[tonewheel]] or \"phonic wheel\" by listening to the moving gears of his electric clocks and the tones produced by them.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=63}} He gathered pieces from a second-hand piano he had purchased for $15 and combined it with a tonewheel generator in a similar form to the telharmonium, albeit much shorter and more compact. Since Hammond was not a musician, he asked the company's assistant treasurer, W. L. Lahey, to help him achieve the desired organ sound.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=57}} To cut costs, Hammond made a pedalboard with only 25 notes, instead of the standard 32 on church organs, and it quickly became a ''de facto'' standard.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=63}}\n\nOn April 24, 1934, Hammond filed a patent for an \"electrical musical instrument\",<ref>\n{{US patent reference\n| number=1956350\n| issue-date=April 24, 1934\n| inventor=Laurens Hammond\n| title=[http://www.google.com/patents?id=NUlkAAAAEBAJ Electrical Musical Instrument]\n}}</ref> which was personally delivered to the patent office by Hanert, explaining that they could start production immediately and it would be good for local employment in Chicago.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=59}} The invention was unveiled to the public in April 1935, and the first model, the Model A, was made available in June of that year.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=68}} Over 1,750 churches purchased a Hammond organ in the first three years of manufacturing, and by the end of the 1930s, over 200 instruments were being made each month.{{sfn|Waring|2002|p=319}} For all its subsequent success with professional musicians, the original company did not target its products at that market, principally because Hammond did not think  enough money was  in it.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=60}} The Hammond Organ Company produced an estimated two million instruments in its lifetime; these have been described as \"probably the most successful electronic organs ever made\".{{sfn|Waring|2002|p=319}} In 1966, an estimated 50,000 churches had installed a Hammond.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=26}}\n\nIn 1936, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) filed a complaint claiming that the Hammond Company made \"false and misleading\" claims in advertisements for its organ, including that the Hammond could produce \"the entire range of tone coloring of a pipe organ\".<ref>{{cite journal| title = Federal Trade Commission Decision: Official Findings and Order|journal = The American Organist| volume = 21| issue = 8| date = August 1938}}</ref> The complaint resulted in lengthy hearing proceedings, which featured a series of auditory tests that pitted a Hammond costing about $2600 against a $75,000 Skinner pipe organ in the University of Chicago [[Rockefeller Chapel]].<ref>{{cite magazine| title = Federal Trade Commission Sponsors Auditory Test\u2014Hammond vs. $75,000 Organ|magazine=Piano Trade Magazine| date = April 1937}}</ref> During the auditory tests, sustained tones and excerpts from musical works were played on the electric and pipe organs while a group of musicians and laymen attempted to distinguish between the instruments. While attorneys for Hammond argued that the test listeners were wrong or guessed nearly half the time, witnesses for the FTC claimed that Hammond employees had unfairly manipulated the Skinner organ to sound more like the Hammond.<ref>{{cite magazine| title = Hammond Arguments presented in Briefs|magazine=[[The Diapason (magazine)|The Diapason]]| date=May 1, 1938}}</ref> In 1938, the FTC ordered Hammond to \"cease and desist\" a number of advertising claims, including that its instrument was equivalent to a $10,000 pipe organ. After the FTC's decision, Hammond claimed that the hearings had vindicated his company's assertions that the organ produced \"real\", \"fine\", and \"beautiful\" music, phrases which were each cited in the FTC's original complaint, but not included in the \"cease and desist\" order. Hammond also claimed that although the hearing was expensive for his company, the proceedings generated so much publicity that \"as a result we sold enough extra organs to cover the expense.\"<ref name=\"diapason\">{{cite magazine| title = Hammond is Ordered to 'Cease and Desist'|magazine=[[The Diapason (magazine)|The Diapason]]| date=August 1, 1938}}</ref>\n\nA key ingredient to the Hammond organ's success was the use of dealerships and a sense of community. Several dedicated organ dealers set up business in the United States{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=16}} and there was a bi-monthly newsletter, ''The Hammond Times'', mailed out to subscribers.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=18}} Advertisements tended to show families gathered around the instrument, often with a child playing it, as an attempt to show the organ as a center-point of home life and to encourage children to learn music.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=25}}\n\n===Tonewheel organs===\nHammond organs, as manufactured by the original company, can be divided into two main groups:\n* '''Console organs''' have two 61-note manuals and a pedalboard of at least two [[octave]]s. Most consoles do not have a built-in [[power amplifier]] or speakers, so an [[Keyboard amplifier|external amplifier and speaker cabinet]] is required.\n* '''Spinet organs''' have two 44-note manuals and one octave of pedals, plus an internal power amplifier and set of speakers.{{sfn|Bush|Kassel|2006|p=169}}\n\n====Console organs====\n{{Listen\n| filename=Hammond_Organ_-_Model_A_Medley.ogg\n| title=Medley\n| description=A medley played on a 1935 Model A Hammond organ through a [[Leslie speaker]].\n| format=[[Ogg]]}}\n[[File:Hammond B3, Museum of Making Music (without warning board).jpg|thumb|left|The B-3 was the most popular Hammond organ, produced from 1954 to 1974{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=33}}]]\nThe first model in production, in June 1935, was the Model A. It contained most of the features that came to be standard on all console Hammonds, including two 61-key manuals, a 25-key pedalboard, an expression pedal, 12 reverse-color preset keys, two sets of drawbars for each manual, and one for the pedals.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=69}}\n\nTo address concerns that the sound of the Hammond was not rich enough to accurately mimic a pipe organ, the model BC was introduced in December 1936. It included a chorus generator, in which a second tonewheel system added slightly sharp or flat tones to the overall sound of each note. The cabinet was made deeper to accommodate this.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=69}} Production of the old Model A cases stopped, but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=68}}\n\nCriticism that the Hammond organ was more aesthetically suitable to the home instead of the church led to the introduction of the model C in September 1939. It contained the same internals as the AB or BC, but covered on the front and sides by [[modesty panel|\"modesty panels\"]] to cover female organists' legs while playing in a skirt, often a consideration when a church organ was placed in front of the congregation. The model C did not contain the chorus generator, but had space in the cabinet for it to be fitted. The concurrent model D was a model C with a prefitted chorus.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=71}} Development of the vibrato system took place during the early 1940s, and was put into production shortly after the end of [[World War II]]. The various models available were the BV and CV (vibrato only) and BCV and DV (vibrato and chorus).{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=69}}\n\n[[File:Hammond Concert model E Organ - Science Museum, London.jpg|thumb|left|The Concert Model E was designed for the church and features a full 32-note pedalboard.]]\nThe B-2 and C-2, introduced in 1949, allowed vibrato to be enabled or disabled on each manual separately.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=54}} In 1954, the B-3 and C-3 models were introduced with the additional harmonic percussion feature.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=33,49}} Despite several attempts by Hammond to replace them, these two models remained popular{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=83}} and stayed in continuous production through early 1975.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=33}}\n\nTo cater more specifically to the church market, Hammond introduced the Concert Model E in July 1937, which included a full 32-note pedalboard and four electric switches known as toe pistons, allowing various sounds to be selected by the feet.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=72}} The model E was replaced by the model RT in 1949, which retained the full-sized pedalboard, but otherwise was internally identical to the B and C models. RT-2 and RT-3 models subsequently appeared in line with the B-2/C-2 and B-3/C-3, respectively.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=74}}\n\n[[File:Hammond H-100 series.jpg|thumb|The H-100 was an unsuccessful attempt to replace the B-3]]\nIn 1959, Hammond introduced the A-100 series. It was effectively a self-contained version of the B-3/C-3, with an internal power amplifier and speakers. The organ was manufactured in a variety of different chassis, with the last two digits of the specific model number determining the style and finish of the instrument. For example, A-105 was \"Tudor styling in light oak or walnut\", while the A-143 was \"warm cherry finish, Early American styling\".{{sfn|Vail|2002|pages=74\u201375}} This model numbering scheme was used for several other series of console and spinet organs that subsequently appeared. The D-100 series, which provided a self-contained version of the RT-3, followed in 1963.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=76}}\n\nThe E-100 series was a cost-reduced version of the A-100 introduced in 1965, with only one set of drawbars per manual, a reduced number of presets, and a slightly different tone generator.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=77}} This was followed by the H-100 series, with a redesigned tonewheel generator and various other additional features.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=83}} The organ was not particularly well made, and suffered a reputation for being unreliable. Hammond service engineer Harvey Olsen said, \"When they [H-100s] work, they sound pretty decent. But die-hard enthusiasts won't touch it.\"{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=85-86}}\n\n====Spinet organs====\n[[File:Hammond L-112.jpg|thumb|left|The L-100 spinet was particularly popular in the UK.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=78}}]]\nThough the instrument had been originally designed for use in a church, Hammond realized that the amateur home market was a far more lucrative business, and started manufacturing spinet organs in the late 1940s.{{sfn|Th\u00e9berge|1997|p=47}} Outside of the United States, they were manufactured in greater numbers than the consoles, and hence were more widely used. Several different types of M series instruments were produced between 1948 and 1964; they contained two 44-note manuals with one set of drawbars each, and a 12-note pedalboard. The M model was produced from 1948 to 1951, the M-2 from 1951 to 1955, and the M-3 from 1955 to 1964.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=89}} The M series was replaced by the M-100 series in 1961, which used a numbering system to identify the body style and finish as used on earlier console series. It included the same manuals as the M, but increased the pedalboard size to 13 notes, stretching a full octave, and included a number of presets.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=91}}\n\n[[File:Hammond T400 series with Rhythm II, My Room.jpg|thumb|The T-402 was one of the last tonewheel organs manufactured and included a built in [[drum machine]]]]\nThe L-100 series entered production at the same time as the M-100. It was an economy version, with various cost-cutting changes so the organ could retail for under $1000. The vibrato was a simpler circuit than on other consoles and spinets. Two variations of the vibrato were provided, plus a chorus that mixed various vibrato signals together.

The X-66 contained just 12 tonewheels, and used electronics for [[Frequency divider organ|frequency division]]. It contained separate \"vibrato bass\" and \"vibrato treble\" in an attempt to simulate a Leslie speaker. Hammond designed it as the company's flagship product, in response to market competition and to replace the B-3. However, it was considered expensive at $9,795 and it sold poorly. It did not sound like a B-3.{{sfn|Vail|2002|pages=94\u201395}}\n\nHammond introduced their first [[integrated circuit]] (IC) model, the Concorde, in 1971.{{sfn|Kakehashi|2002|p=176}} The company had stopped manufacturing tonewheel organs entirely by 1975, due to increased financial inefficiency,{{sfn|Riley|2006|p=58,63}} and switched to making IC models full-time.

Leslie. The Leslie system is an integrated speaker/amplifier combination in which sound is emitted by a rotating [[Horn (acoustic)|horn]] over a stationary treble [[compression driver]], and a rotating [[Sound baffle|baffle]] beneath a stationary bass [[woofer]]. This creates a characteristic sound because of the constantly changing pitch shifts that result from the [[Doppler effect]] created by the moving sound sources.{{sfn|Brice|2001|p=427}}\n\nThe Leslie was originally designed to mimic the complex tones and constantly shifting sources of sound emanating from a large group of ranks in a pipe organ. The effect varies depending on the speed of the rotors, which can be toggled between fast (tremolo) and slow (chorale) using a console [[half-moon switch|half-moon]] or pedal switch, with the most distinctive effect occurring as the speaker rotation speed changes. The most popular Leslies were the 122, which accepted a balanced signal suitable for console organs, and the 147, which accepted an unbalanced signal and could be used for spinet organs with a suitable adapter.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=129}} The Pro-Line series of Leslies which were made to be portable for gigging bands using solid-state amps were popular during the 1970s.{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=164}}\n[[File:Half-Moon Switch.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A \"half-moon\"-shaped switch for changing the speed of a Leslie speaker]]\nLeslie initially tried to sell his invention to Hammond, but Laurens Hammond was unimpressed and declined to purchase it.

Each one rotates in front of an electromagnetic pickup. The variation in the [[magnetic field]] induces a small [[alternating current]] at a particular frequency, which represents a signal similar to a [[sine wave]]. When a key is pressed on the organ, it completes a circuit of nine electrical switches, which are linked to the drawbars. The position of the drawbars, combined with the switches selected by the key pressed, determines which tonewheels are allowed to sound.<ref name=\"reid200311\">\n{{cite journal\n| last       = Reid |first=Gordon\n| title      = Synthesizing tonewheel organs\n| url        = http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov03/articles/synthsecrets.htm\n| journal    = Sound On Sound\n| date       = November 2003\n| accessdate = April 25, 2011\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n |title      = Technical Information for Hammond Tone Wheel Organ\n |url        = http://b3world.com/hammond-techinfo3.html\n |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20000519040737/http://www.b3world.com/hammond-techinfo3.html\n |dead-url   = yes\n |archive-date = May 19, 2000\n |publisher  = Keyboard Exchange International\n |accessdate = April 25, 2011\n}}</ref>{{sfn|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=71}} Every tonewheel is connected to a synchronous motor via a system of gears, which ensures that each note remains at a constant relative pitch to every other.{{sfn|Campbell|Greated|Myers|2004|p=441}} The combined signal from all depressed keys and pedals is fed through to the vibrato system, which is driven by a metal scanner. As the scanner rotates around a set of pickups, it changes the pitch of the overall sound slightly.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=48}} From here, the sound is sent to the main amplifier, and on to the audio speakers.\n\n[[File:Organ light tonegenerator.JPG|thumb|right|A prototype light-weight tonewheel generator, produced at the Hammond Organ Company's factory in [[Antwerp]]]]\nThe Hammond organ makes technical compromises in the notes it generates.

One of the first performers to use the Hammond organ was [[Ethel Smith (organist)|Ethel Smith]], who was known as the \"first lady of the Hammond organ\".{{sfn|Corbin|2006|p=153}} [[Fats Waller]] and [[Count Basie]] also started using the Hammond.{{sfn|Kirchner|2005|p=384}} Organist [[John Medeski]] thinks the Hammond became \"the poor man's big band\", but because of that, it became more economical to book [[organ trio]]s.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=18}}\n\nJimmy Smith began to play Hammond regularly in the 1950s, particularly in his sessions for the [[Blue Note]] label between 1956 and 1963. He eschewed a bass player, and played all the bass parts himself using the pedals,{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=1170}} generally using a walking bassline on the pedals in combination with percussive left-hand chords. His trio format, composed of organ, guitar, and drums, became internationally famous following an appearance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in 1957.{{sfn|Kirchner|2005|p=384}} Medeski says musicians \"were inspired when they heard Jimmy Smith's records.\"{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=19}} [[Jack McDuff|\"Brother\" Jack McDuff]] switched from piano to Hammond in 1959, and toured regularly throughout the 1960s and 1970s.{{sfn|Davis|2012|p=236}} In his Hammond playing, [[Keith Emerson]] sought partly to replicate the sound achieved by McDuff in his arrangement of \"Rock Candy\".{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=168}} An admirer of [[Billy Preston]]'s work also, particularly the 1965 instrumental \"[[Billy's Bag]]\", Emerson limited the use of Leslie because he felt that was Preston's domain at the time, whereas he himself was approaching the instrument with an aesthetic combining \"a white European attitude\", classical music, and rock.{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=169}}\n\n[[File:Keith Emerson & Moog 15May10.jpg|thumb|\"I took to riding the L100 like a bucking bronco.

Jones]] is cited as being the bridge from [[rhythm and blues]] to rock. British organist [[James Taylor Quartet|James Taylor]] said the Hammond \"became popular [in the UK] when people such as [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]] and artists on the [[Stax Records]] label came over to London and played gigs.\"{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=21}} [[Matthew Fisher (musician)|Matthew Fisher]] first encountered the Hammond in 1966, having heard the [[Small Faces]]' [[Ian McLagan]] playing one. When Fisher asked if he could play it, McLagan told him, \"They're yelling out for Hammond players; why don't you go out and buy one for yourself?\"{{sfn|Johansen|2001|p=65}} Fisher went on to play the organ lines on [[Procol Harum]]'s \"[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]\", which topped the UK charts in the summer of 1967.{{sfn|Johansen|2001|p=66}}{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=33}} [[Steve Winwood]] started his musical career with the [[Spencer Davis Group]] playing guitar and piano, but he switched to Hammond when he hired one to record \"[[Gimme Some Lovin']]\".{{sfn|Welch|1990|p=73}}\n\n[[Gregg Allman]] became interested in the Hammond after [[Mike Finnigan]] had introduced him to Jimmy Smith's music, and started to write material with it.{{sfn|Allman|2012|p=67-68}} His brother [[Duane Allman|Duane]] specifically requested he play the instrument when forming the [[Allman Brothers Band]],{{sfn|Allman|2012|p=97}} and he was presented with a brand new B-3 and Leslie 122RV upon joining. Allman recalls the instrument was cumbersome to transport, particularly on flights of stairs, which often required the whole band's assistance.{{sfn|Allman|2012|pages=100\u2013101}} Author Frank Moriarty considers Allman's Hammond playing a vital ingredient of the band's sound.{{sfn|Moriarty|2003|p=44}}\n\n[[File:Deep Purple, John Lord 1970.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jon Lord]] put his Hammond C-3 through an [[distortion (music)|overdriven]] [[Marshall stack]] to fit in with [[Deep Purple]]'s hard rock sound.]]\n[[Deep Purple]]'s [[Jon Lord]] became inspired to play the Hammond after hearing Jimmy Smith's \"Walk on the Wild Side\".<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.thehighwaystar.com/interviews/lord/jl19741000.html|title=Deep Purple's Jon Lord and 'Burn'|publisher=Circus Magazine|last=Cohen|first=Scott|pages=42\u201345|date=October 1974|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref> He modified his Hammond so it could be played through a [[Marshall stack]] to get a growling, overdriven sound,{{sfn|Till|2010|p=122}} which became known as his trademark and he is strongly identified with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonlord.org/a-biography/|title=Jon Lord \u2013 A Biography|publisher=Jon Lord (official site)|accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref> This organ was later acquired by [[Joey DeFrancesco]].{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=186}} [[Van der Graaf Generator]]'s [[Hugh Banton]] modified his Hammond E-100 extensively with customised electronics, including the ability to put effects such as [[distortion (music)|distortion]] on one manual but not the other, and rewiring the motor. The modifications created, in Banton's own words, \"unimaginable sonic chaos.\"{{sfn|Faragher|2011|p=369}}\n\n[[File:Joey-defrancesco-ffm-003.jpg|thumb|[[Joey DeFrancesco]] has achieved critical success in the jazz genre using both original tonewheel Hammonds and the \"New B-3\".]]\nThe Hammond was a key instrument in [[progressive rock]] music. Author Edward Macan thinks this is because of its versatility, allowing both chords and lead lines to be played, and a choice between quiet and clean, and what Emerson described as a \"tacky, aggressive, almost distorted, angry sound.\"{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=34}} Emerson first found commercial success with [[the Nice]], with whom he used and abused an L-100, putting knives in the instrument, setting fire to it, playing it upside down, or riding it across stage in the manner of a horse. He continued to play the instrument in this manner alongside other keyboards in [[Emerson, Lake and Palmer]].{{sfn|Cateforis|2011|p=158}} Other prominent Hammond organists in progressive rock include [[the Zombies]]' and [[Argent (band)|Argent]]'s [[Rod Argent]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]]'s [[Tony Kaye (musician)|Tony Kaye]] and [[Rick Wakeman]], [[Focus (band)|Focus]]'s [[Thijs van Leer]], [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]]'s [[Ken Hensley]], [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Rick Wright]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]]'s [[Steve Walsh (musician)|Steve Walsh]], and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]'s [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]]. Banks later claimed he only used the Hammond because a piano was impractical to transport to gigs.{{sfn|Awde|2008|p=200}}\n\n[[Ska]] and [[reggae]] music made frequent use of the Hammond throughout the 1960s and 1970s. [[Junior Marvin]] started to play the instrument after hearing Booker T & The MGs' \"[[Green Onions]]\", although he complained about its weight.{{sfn|Masouri|2010|p=71}} Winston Wright was regarded in the music scene of [[Jamaica]] as one of the best organ players, and used the Hammond when performing live with [[Toots and the Maytals]], as well as playing it on sessions with [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]], [[Jimmy Cliff]], and [[Gregory Isaacs]].{{sfn|Moskowitz|2006|p=320}} [[Tyrone Downie]], best known as [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]]' keyboard player, made prominent use of the Hammond on \"[[No Woman, No Cry]]\", as recorded at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London]], for the album [[Live! (Bob Marley & the Wailers album)|''Live!'']]{{sfn|Masouri|2010|p=596}}\n\n[[File:BarbaraDennerlein2010.jpg|thumb|left|[[Barbara Dennerlein]] has been praised for her work on the Hammond's [[Pedal keyboard|bass pedals.]]]]\nThe Hammond organ was perceived as outdated by the late 1970s, particularly in the UK, where it was often used to perform pop songs in social clubs.{{sfn|Fowles|Wade|2012|pages=165\u2013166}} [[Punk rock|Punk]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] bands tended to prefer second-hand [[combo organs]] from the 1960s, or use no keyboards at all.{{sfn|Cateforis|2011|p=104,160}} Other groups started taking advantage of cheaper and more portable [[synthesizer]]s that were starting to come onto the market.{{sfn|Fowles|Wade|2012|pages=136\u2013137}} [[The Stranglers]]' [[Dave Greenfield]] was an exception to this, and used a Hammond onstage during the band's early career. Andy Thompson, better known for being an aficionado of the [[Mellotron]], stated, \"the Hammond never really went away. There are a lot of studios that have had a B-3 or C-3 sitting away in there since the 70s.\"{{sfn|Awde|2008|p=531}} The instrument underwent a brief renaissance in the 1980s with the [[mod revival]] movement. Taylor played the Hammond through the 1980s, first with [[the Prisoners]] and later with the [[James Taylor Quartet]].{{sfn|Bogdanov|2001|p=507}} The sound of the Hammond has appeared in [[hip-hop]] music, albeit mostly via samples. A significant use is the [[Beastie Boys]]' 1992 single \"[[So What'cha Want]]\", which features a Hammond mixed into the foreground (the instrument was recorded live rather than being sampled).{{sfn|Vail|2002|p=22}}\n\nJazz, blues, and gospel musicians continued to use Hammond organs into the 21st century. [[Barbara Dennerlein]] has received critical acclaim for her performances on the Hammond, particularly her use of the bass pedals,{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=325}} and has modified the instrument to include [[sampling (music)|samplers]] triggered by the pedals.{{sfn|Enstice|Stockhouse|2004|pp=96\u2013110}} Joey DeFrancesco embraced the instrument during the 1990s, and later collaborated with Jimmy Smith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joey-defrancesco-mn0000209719/biography|title=Joey DeFrancesco: Artist Biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|accessdate=July 30, 2013}}</ref> He is positive about the future of the Hammond organ, saying \"Everybody loves it.

There is no consistent order to the appearance of the symptoms, if symptoms even occur. Specific manifestations may also vary by age, by severity of the hypoglycemia and the speed of the decline. In young children, vomiting can sometimes accompany morning hypoglycemia with [[ketosis]]. In older children and adults, moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble [[mania]], mental illness, drug intoxication, or drunkenness. In the elderly, hypoglycemia can produce focal [[stroke]]-like effects or a hard-to-define malaise. The symptoms of a single person may be similar from episode to episode, but are not necessarily so and may be influenced by the speed at which glucose levels are dropping, as well as previous incidents.\n\nIn newborns, hypoglycemia can produce irritability, jitters, [[myoclonic jerk]]s, [[cyanosis]], respiratory distress, [[apnea|apneic]] episodes, sweating, [[hypothermia]], somnolence, [[hypotonia]], refusal to feed, and seizures or \"spells.\" Hypoglycemia can resemble [[asphyxia]], [[hypocalcemia]], [[sepsis]], or [[heart failure]].\n\nIn both young and old patients, the brain may habituate to low glucose levels, with a reduction of noticeable symptoms despite [[neuroglycopenia|neuroglycopenic]] impairment. In insulin-dependent diabetic patients this phenomenon is termed ''[[Diabetic hypoglycemia#Hypoglycemic unawareness|hypoglycemia unawareness]]'' and is a significant clinical problem when improved [[Diabetes management#Glycemic control|glycemic control]] is attempted. Another aspect of this phenomenon occurs in [[glycogen storage disease|type I glycogenosis]], when chronic hypoglycemia before diagnosis may be better tolerated than acute hypoglycemia after treatment is underway.\n\nHypoglycemic symptoms can also occur when one is sleeping. Examples of symptoms during sleep can include damp bed sheets or clothes from perspiration. Having nightmares or the act of crying out can be a sign of hypoglycemia. Once the individual is awake they may feel tired, irritable, or confused and these may be signs of hypoglycemia as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia |title=Hypoglycemia&nbsp;\u2013 National Diabetes Information Clearinghouse |publisher=Diabetes.niddk.nih.gov |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308211445/http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/hypoglycemia/ |archivedate=8 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn nearly all cases, hypoglycemia that is severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain. Cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged, untreated unconsciousness, interference with breathing, severe concurrent disease, or some other type of vulnerability. Nevertheless, brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe hypoglycemia.\n\nResearch in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below 3.6 mM (65&nbsp;mg/dL). [[hormone|Hormonal]] defense mechanisms ([[adrenaline]] and [[glucagon]]) are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level (about 55&nbsp;mg/dL (3.0 mM) for most people), producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and [[dysphoria]].<ref name=\"isbn0-7216-9196-X\">{{Cite book|author=Cryer, Philip E. |editor=Larsen, P.

Since the brain effects of hypoglycemia, termed [[neuroglycopenia]], determine whether a given low glucose is a \"problem\" for that person, most doctors use the term ''hypoglycemia'' only when a moderately low glucose level is accompanied by symptoms or brain effects.\n\nDetermining the presence of both parts of this definition is not always straightforward, as hypoglycemic symptoms and effects are vague and can be produced by other conditions; people with recurrently low glucose levels can lose their threshold symptoms so that severe neuroglycopenic impairment can occur without much warning, and many measurement methods (especially glucose meters) are imprecise at low levels.\n\nIt may take longer to recover from severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness or seizure even after restoration of normal blood glucose. When a person has not been unconscious, failure of carbohydrate to reverse the symptoms in 10\u201315 minutes increases the likelihood that hypoglycemia was not the cause of the symptoms. When severe hypoglycemia has persisted in a hospitalized person, the amount of glucose required to maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels becomes an important clue to the underlying etiology. Glucose requirements above 10&nbsp;mg/kg/minute in infants, or 6&nbsp;mg/kg/minute in children and adults are strong evidence for [[hyperinsulinism]]. In this context this is referred to as the ''glucose infusion rate'' (GIR). Finally, the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia. A rise of blood glucose by more than 30&nbsp;mg/dL (1.70&nbsp;mmol/l) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia.\n\n===Long-term effects===\nSignificant hypoglycemia appears to increase the risk of [[cardiovascular disease]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Goto|first=Atshushi|title=Severe hypoglycaemia and cardiovascular disease: systematic review and meta-analysis with bias analysis|journal=BMJ|date=July 30, 2013|doi=10.1136/bmj.f4533|volume=347|pages=f4533}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n{{main|List of causes of hypoglycemia}}\nThe most common cause of hypoglycemia is medications used to treat [[diabetes mellitus]] such as [[insulin]], [[sulfonylurea]]s, and [[biguanide]]s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=\"Sch2007\"/> Risk is greater in diabetics who have eaten less than usual, exercised more than usual, or drunk [[ethanol|alcohol]].<ref name=NIH2008/> Other causes of hypoglycemia include [[kidney failure]], certain [[tumors]], [[liver disease]], [[hypothyroidism]], [[starvation]], [[inborn errors of metabolism]], [[sepsis|severe infections]], [[reactive hypoglycemia]], and a number of drugs including alcohol.<ref name=NIH2008/><ref name=Sch2007/> Low blood sugar may occur in babies who are otherwise healthy who have not eaten for a few hours.<ref name=Perk2008/> Inborn errors of metabolism may include the lack of an enzyme to make glycogen (glycogen storage type 0).\n\n===Serious illness===\nSerious illness may result in low blood sugar.<ref name=NIH2008/> Severe disease of nearly all major organ systems can cause hypoglycemia as a secondary problem. [[Hospital]]ized persons, especially in [[intensive care unit]]s or those prevented from eating, can develop hypoglycemia from a variety of circumstances related to the care of their primary disease. Hypoglycemia in these circumstances is often multifactorial or [[Iatrogenesis|caused by the healthcare]]. Once identified, these types of hypoglycemia are readily reversed and prevented, and the underlying disease becomes the primary problem.\n\n===Hormone deficiency===\nNot enough cortisol, such as in [[Addison's disease]], not enough glucagon, or not enough epinephrine can result in low blood sugar.<ref name=NIH2008/> This is a more common cause in children.<ref name=NIH2008/>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\nLike most animal tissues, brain [[metabolism]] depends primarily on glucose for fuel in most circumstances. A limited amount of glucose can be derived from [[glycogen]] stored in [[astrocyte]]s, but it is consumed within minutes. For most practical purposes, the brain is dependent on a continual supply of glucose diffusing from the blood into the interstitial tissue within the [[central nervous system]] and into the [[neuron]]s themselves.\n\nTherefore, if the amount of glucose supplied by the blood falls, the brain is one of the first organs affected. In most people, subtle reduction of mental efficiency can be observed when the glucose falls below 65&nbsp;mg/dL (3.6 mM). Impairment of action and judgment usually becomes obvious below 40&nbsp;mg/dL (2.2 mM). Seizures may occur as the glucose falls further. As blood glucose levels fall below 10&nbsp;mg/dL (0.55 mM), most neurons become electrically silent and nonfunctional, resulting in [[coma]]. These brain effects are collectively referred to as [[neuroglycopenia]].\n\nThe importance of an adequate supply of glucose to the brain is apparent from the number of nervous, hormonal and metabolic responses to a falling glucose level. Most of these are defensive or adaptive, tending to raise the blood sugar by [[glycogenolysis]] and [[gluconeogenesis]] or provide alternative fuels. If the blood sugar level falls too low, the liver converts a storage of glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream, to prevent the person going into a [[diabetic coma]], for a short time.\n\nBrief or mild hypoglycemia produces no lasting effects on the brain, though it can temporarily alter brain responses to additional hypoglycemia. Prolonged, severe hypoglycemia can produce lasting damage of a wide range. This can include impairment of cognitive function, motor control, or even consciousness. The likelihood of permanent brain damage from any given instance of severe hypoglycemia is difficult to estimate and depends on a multitude of factors such as age, recent blood and brain glucose experience, concurrent problems such as [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and availability of alternative fuels.\n\nIt has been frequently found that those type 1 diabetics found \"dead in bed\" in the morning after suspected severe hypoglycemia had some underlying coronary pathology that led to an induced fatal heart attack. Recently,{{when|date=February 2018}} several of these individuals found \"dead in bed\" were wearing [[continuous glucose monitor]]s (CGMs), which provided a history of glucose levels before the fatal event. In several cases the fatality was preceded by at least two hours of blood glucose levels under 40&nbsp;mg/dL, possibly lower as CGMs are not accurate at levels below 40&nbsp;mg/dL. The individuals failed to respond to the audible alarms produced by the monitors which may have been \"alarming\" for many hours.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe vast majority of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes result in no detectable permanent harm.<ref>{{Cite book|editor=Allen I.

This is usually conducted in the hospital, and the duration depends on the age of the patient and response to the fast. A healthy adult can usually maintain a glucose level above 50&nbsp;mg/dL (2.8 mM) for 72 hours, a child for 36 hours, and an infant for 24 hours. The purpose of the fast is to determine whether the person can maintain his or her blood glucose as long as normal, and can respond to fasting with the appropriate metabolic changes. At the end of the fast the insulin should be nearly undetectable and [[ketosis]] should be fully established. The patient's blood glucose levels are monitored and a critical specimen is obtained if the glucose falls. Despite its unpleasantness and expense, a diagnostic fast may be the only effective way to confirm or refute a number of serious forms of hypoglycemia, especially those involving excessive insulin.\n\nThe precise level of glucose considered low enough to define hypoglycemia is dependent on (1) the measurement method, (2) the age of the person, (3) presence or absence of effects, and (4) the purpose of the definition. While there is no disagreement as to the normal range of blood sugar, debate continues as to what degree of hypoglycemia warrants medical evaluation or treatment, or can cause harm.<ref name=\"Koh_1988\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Koh TH, Eyre JA, Aynsley-Green A |title=Neonatal hypoglycaemia \u2013 the controversy regarding definition |journal=Arch.

This leads people to use different \"cutoff levels\" of glucose in different contexts and for different purposes. Because of all the variations, the Endocrine Society recommends that a diagnosis of hypoglycemia as a problem for an individual be based on the combination of a low glucose level and evidence of adverse effects.<ref name=Cry2009/>\n\nGlucose concentrations are expressed as milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL or mg/100 mL) in Lebanon, the United States, Japan, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, India and Israel, while millimoles per [[liter]] (mmol/L or mM) are the units used in most of the rest of the world. Glucose concentrations expressed as mg/dL can be converted to mmol/L by dividing by 18.0 g/dmol (the [[molar mass]] of glucose). For example, a glucose concentration of 90&nbsp;mg/dL is 5.0&nbsp;mmol/L or 5.0 mM.\n\nThe circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Circumstances include the age of the person, time of day, time since last meal, previous episodes, nutritional status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxins (especially insulin or other diabetes drugs), diseases of other organ systems, family history, and response to treatment. When hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly, a record or \"diary\" of the spells over several months, noting the circumstances of each spell (time of day, relation to last meal, nature of last meal, response to carbohydrate, and so forth) may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the hypoglycemia.\n\n===Method of measurement===\n[[Blood glucose]] levels discussed in this article are [[vein|venous]] [[Blood plasma|plasma or serum]] levels measured by standard, automated [[glucose oxidase]] methods used in [[medical laboratory|medical laboratories]]. For clinical purposes, plasma and serum levels are similar enough to be interchangeable. [[Artery|Arterial]] plasma or serum levels are slightly higher than [[venous]] levels, and [[capillary]] levels are typically in between.<ref name=Tustison/> This difference between arterial and venous levels is small in the fasting state but is amplified and can be greater than 10% in the postprandial state.<ref name = \"rssxhn\">{{Cite book|editor=John Bernard Henry |title=Clinical diagnosis and management by laboratory methods |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=1979 |pages= |isbn=0-7216-4639-5 |oclc= 4884633|doi=}}</ref> On the other hand, whole blood glucose levels (e.g., by [[glucose meter|fingerprick meters]]) are about 10\u201315% lower than venous plasma levels.<ref name=Tustison>{{cite journal |vauthors=Tustison WA, Bowen AJ, Crampton JH |title=Clinical interpretation of plasma glucose values |journal=Diabetes |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=775\u20137 |year=1966 |pmid=5924610 |doi=10.2337/diab.15.11.775 }}</ref> Furthermore, available [[fingerstick]] glucose meters are only warranted to be accurate to within 15% of a simultaneous laboratory value under optimal conditions,{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} and home use in the investigation of hypoglycemia is fraught with misleading low numbers.<ref name=Clarke_1987>{{cite journal |vauthors=Clarke WL, Cox D, Gonder-Frederick LA, Carter W, Pohl SL |title=Evaluating clinical accuracy of systems for self-monitoring of blood glucose |journal=Diabetes Care |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=622\u20138 |year=1987 |pmid=3677983 | doi = 10.2337/diacare.10.5.622}}</ref><ref name=Gama_2000>{{cite journal |vauthors=Gama R, Anderson NR, Marks V |title='Glucose meter hypoglycaemia': often a non-disease |journal=Ann.

The disparity between venous and whole blood concentrations is greater when the hematocrit is high, as in newborn infants, or adults with [[polycythemia]].<ref name = \"rssxhn\"/> High neonatal hematocrits are particularly likely to confound glucose measurement by meter. Second, unless the specimen is drawn into a [[sodium fluoride|fluoride]] tube or processed immediately to separate the serum or plasma from the cells, the measurable glucose will be gradually lowered by ''in vitro'' metabolism of the glucose at a rate of approximately 7&nbsp;mg/dL/h, or even more in the presence of [[leukocytosis]].<ref name = \"rssxhn\"/><ref name=dePasqua_1984>{{cite journal |vauthors=de Pasqua A, Mattock MB, Phillips R, Keen H |title=Errors in blood glucose determination |journal=Lancet |volume=2 |issue=8412 |page=1165 |year=1984 |pmid=6150231 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(84)91611-8}}</ref><ref name=Horwitz_1989>{{cite journal |author=Horwitz DL |title=Factitious and artifactual hypoglycemia |journal=Endocrinol.

Experts continue to debate the significance and risk of such levels, though the trend has been to recommend maintenance of glucose levels above 60\u201370&nbsp;mg/dL the first day after birth.\n\n[[Diabetic hypoglycemia]] represents a special case with respect to the relationship of measured glucose and hypoglycemic symptoms for several reasons. First, although home glucose meter readings are often misleading, the probability that a low reading, whether accompanied by symptoms or not, represents real hypoglycemia is much higher in a person who takes insulin than in someone who does not.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/308/9/485?ijkey=f5b959a37b1a8754a4e583ffd636126f572e97c7&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |title=20 White NH, Skor D, Cryer PE, Bier DM, Levandoski L, Santiago JV: Identification of type 1 diabetic patients at increased risk for hypoglycemia during intensive therapy |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=308 |issue=9 |pages=485\u201391 |year=1983 |accessdate=2012-03-10 |doi=10.1056/nejm198303033080903 |pmid=6337335 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090512205023/http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/abstract/308/9/485?ijkey=f5b959a37b1a8754a4e583ffd636126f572e97c7&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |archivedate=12 May 2009 |df=dmy-all |last1=White |first1=Neil H |last2=Skor |first2=Donald A |last3=Cryer |first3=Philip E |last4=Levandoski |first4=Lucy A |last5=Bier |first5=Dennis M |last6=Santiago |first6=Julio V }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/8/732?ijkey=f8bbc21f8a2aa52bf4be5331deba240047cdaac7&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |author=Bolli GB, De Feo P, De Cosmo S, Perriello G, Ventura MM, Massi-Benedetti M, Santeusanio F, Gerich JE, Brunetti P |title=A reliable and reproducible test for adequate glucose counterregulation in type 1 diabetes |journal=Diabetes |volume=33 |issue=8 |pages=732\u20137 |date=1984-08-01 |accessdate=2012-03-10 |doi=10.2337/diabetes.33.8.732 |pmid=6378698 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515190652/http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/8/732?ijkey=f8bbc21f8a2aa52bf4be5331deba240047cdaac7&keytype2=tf_ipsecsha |archivedate=15 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Other tests===\nThe following is a brief list of hormones and metabolites which may be measured in a critical sample. Not all tests are checked on every patient. A \"basic version\" would include insulin, cortisol, and electrolytes, with C-peptide and drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children. The value of additional specific tests depends on the most likely diagnoses for an individual patient, based on the circumstances described above. Many of these levels change within minutes, especially if glucose is given, and there is no value in measuring them after the hypoglycemia is reversed. Others, especially those lower in the list, remain abnormal even after hypoglycemia is reversed, and can be usefully measured even if a critical specimen is missed.\n\nPart of the value of the critical sample may simply be the proof that the symptoms are indeed due to hypoglycemia. More often, measurement of certain hormones and metabolites at the time of hypoglycemia indicates which organs and body systems are responding appropriately and which are functioning abnormally. For example, when the blood glucose is low, hormones which raise the glucose should be rising and insulin secretion should be completely suppressed.\n\n===Differential diagnosis===\nIt can also be mistaken for [[alcohol intoxication]].<ref>{{cite book|editor=C. Ronald Kahn|display-editors=etal|title=Joslin's diabetes mellitus|year=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams & Willkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781727969|page=1154|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohgjG0qAvfgC&pg=PA1154|edition=14th|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515222350/https://books.google.com/books?id=ohgjG0qAvfgC&pg=PA1154|archivedate=15 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Prevention==\nThe most effective means of preventing further episodes of hypoglycemia depends on the cause.\n\nThe risk of further episodes of diabetic hypoglycemia can often (but not always) be reduced by lowering the dose of insulin or other medications, or by more meticulous attention to blood sugar balance during unusual hours, higher levels of exercise, or decreasing alcohol intake.\n\nMany of the inborn errors of metabolism require avoidance or shortening of fasting intervals, or extra carbohydrates. For the more severe disorders, such as type 1 glycogen storage disease, this may be supplied in the form of [[cornstarch]] every few hours or by continuous gastric infusion.\n\nSeveral treatments are used for [[hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia]], depending on the exact form and severity. Some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism respond to [[diazoxide]] or [[octreotide]]. Surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when hyperinsulinism is focal or due to a benign insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas. When congenital hyperinsulinism is diffuse and refractory to medications, near-total pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort, but in this condition is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications.\n\nHypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies such as hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency usually ceases when the appropriate hormone is replaced.\n\nHypoglycemia due to dumping syndrome and other post-surgical conditions is best dealt with by altering diet. Including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion. Some forms of this respond to treatment with a [[glucosidase inhibitor]], which slows [[starch]] digestion.\n\nReactive hypoglycemia with demonstrably low blood glucose levels is most often a predictable nuisance which can be avoided by consuming fat and protein with carbohydrates, by adding morning or afternoon snacks, and reducing alcohol intake.\n\nIdiopathic postprandial syndrome without demonstrably low glucose levels at the time of symptoms can be more of a management challenge. Many people find improvement by changing eating patterns (smaller meals, avoiding excessive sugar, mixed meals rather than carbohydrates by themselves), reducing intake of stimulants such as [[caffeine]], or by making lifestyle changes to reduce stress. See the following section of this article.\n\n==Treatment==\nTreatment of some forms of hypoglycemia, such as in diabetes, involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal through the ingestion of carbohydrates, determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes. However, this treatment is not optimal in other forms such as [[reactive hypoglycemia#Treatment|reactive hypoglycemia]], where rapid carbohydrate ingestion may lead to a further hypoglycemic episode.\n\nBlood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking (or receiving) 10\u201320&nbsp;grams of [[carbohydrate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diabetes.co.uk/Diabetes-and-Hypoglycaemia.html |title=Diabetes and Hypoglycemia |publisher=Diabetes.co.uk |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313090543/http://www.diabetes.co.uk/Diabetes-and-Hypoglycaemia.html |archivedate=13 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3\u20134 ounces (100\u2013120 ml) of orange, apple, or grape juice although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose, alternatively, about 4\u20135 ounces (120\u2013150 ml) of regular (non-diet) soda may also work, as will about one slice of bread, about 4 crackers, or about 1 serving of most starchy foods. [[Starch]] is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking [[acarbose]]), but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full recovery may take 10\u201320 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery and if the person has diabetes will simply produce [[hyperglycemia]] afterwards.  A mnemonic used by the [[American Diabetes Association]] and others is the \"rule of 15\"&nbsp;\u2013 consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15-minute wait, repeated if glucose remains low (variable by individual, sometimes 70&nbsp;mg/dL).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-blood-glucose/MY01267 |title=Living with diabetes blog |author1=Nancy Klobassa Davidson, R.N. |author2=Peggy Moreland, R.N. |publisher=Mayo Clinic |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319034417/http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/low-blood-glucose/MY01267 |archivedate=19 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIf a person is suffering such severe effects of hypoglycemia that they cannot (due to combativeness) or should not (due to seizures or unconsciousness) be given anything by mouth, medical personnel such as paramedics, or in-hospital personnel can establish IV access and give intravenous dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%, children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can cause skin necrosis if the IV is infiltrated, sclerosis of veins, and many other fluid and electrolyte disturbances if administered incorrectly. If IV access cannot be established, the patient can be given 1 to 2 milligrams of glucagon in an [[intramuscular injection]]. More treatment information can be found in the article [[diabetic hypoglycemia]].  If a person is suffering less severe effects, and is conscious with the ability to swallow, medical personal such as EMT-B's may administer gelatinous oral glucose.\n\nOne situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking [[acarbose]]. Since acarbose and other [[alpha-glucosidase inhibitor]]s prevents starch and other sugars from being broken down into [[monosaccharide]]s that can be absorbed by the body, patients taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose tablets, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia.\n\n==History==\nHypoglycemia was first discovered by [[James Collip]] when he was working with [[Frederick Banting]] on purifying insulin in 1922.  Collip was tasked with developing an assay to measure the activity of insulin.  He first injected insulin into a rabbit, and then measured the reduction in blood glucose levels.  Measuring blood glucose was a time consuming step.  Collip observed that if he injected rabbits with a too large a dose of insulin, the rabbits began convulsing, went into a coma, and then died.  This observation simplified his assay.  He defined one unit of insulin as the amount necessary to induce this convulsing hypoglycemic reaction in a rabbit.  Collip later found he could save money, and rabbits, by injecting them with glucose once they were convulsing.<ref>{{cite web|title=Collip discovers hypoglycemia|url=https://tacomed.com/chapter-7-standardization/collip-discovers-hypoglycemia/|website=Treating Diabetes|accessdate=18 June 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908182717/https://tacomed.com/chapter-7-standardization/collip-discovers-hypoglycemia/|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word ''hypoglycemia'' is [[American and British English spelling differences#ae and oe|also spelled]] ''hypoglycaemia'' or ''hypoglyc\u00e6mia''.

"format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{WikiProject status|active|sc1=WP:DAYS}}\n<br>\n\nThis is a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject|WikiProject]] page relating to '''days of the year'''. It is meant to be a style guide for date pages (for example, [[January 1]], [[January 2]], [[January 3]], ''etc.''). It is the goal of this project to make all 366 historical anniversary pages consistent in style and content. Pages that are part of this wikiproject will display this on the talk page:\n{{WikiProject Days of the Year|category=no}}\n\n==Style==\n{{WikiProject style advice |type=section |shortcut1=WP:DOYSTYLE}}\n* All entries in the Wikicalendar articles should adhere to the guideline set forth at [[Wikipedia:Days of the year]].  \n* Any change to the page layout that would be a deviation from the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Days_of_the_year/Template|template]] should be discussed on [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Days of the year|this project's talk page]] '''before''' such change is made.  Standard date page layout includes the sections:  Events, Births, Deaths, Holidays and observances, and External links.\n* {{Added}}: Any [[WP:BURDEN|material lacking a reliable source '''directly supporting it''']] may be removed and should not be restored without an inline citation to a reliable source.\t\n* All events, births, deaths, and holidays should be linked to existing Wikipedia articles and those articles should mention the specific events.  Per [[WP:USERG]], such a wikilink is not considered a reliable source, and '''a direct source is required.'''\n* Events should be written in the present tense, not the past or future tense.[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style&oldid=568479367#Request_for_comment_regarding_tense_for_past_events.]  Entries should be written in a timeless fashion so that they do not need to be updated as time passes.  \n* Entries should be concise and informative, and not contain long narratives. Linked articles provide detailed information.\n* The date pages should be kept clean of trivia such as film history, fabricated holidays and observances, fictional events, etc.\n* Items, such as dates and years, should not be linked more than once within a section.  Years of birth in the Deaths section and years of death in the Births section (e.g. (b. 1970)) should not be linked.  Redundant links to other articles (linking the same thing more than once) should be limited to linking in order to support a particular event.  See [[WP:OVERLINK]] for more on the general topic.  \n* Red links should not be created in the Wikicalendar articles.  Only links to existing articles that support the content should be added.\n* Whenever possible, [[Old Style and New Style dates|new style dates]] should be used for entries.  Duplicate entries on corresponding old style dates should be removed.\n* When ordering births and deaths that occur in the same year, listings should be ordered alphabetically by the [[surname]] of the subject.\n* Multiple deaths caused by the same event (e.g. December 7, 1941) may be listed, indented with a \":*\", under the name of the event. See [[December_7#Deaths]] for an example.\n* In keeping with the layout in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Days of the year/Template|template]], entries should be formatted using &amp;ndash; because it is easier to be consistently duplicated in new entries. Often editors will use the - instead of the \u2013 without knowing the difference. Since \u2013 is proper for these pages, it is better to leave them as &amp;ndash;.\n* The External links section is considered static and the addition of new links should be discussed on this project's talk page.\n\n==Task list==\n# Ensure each article has <nowiki>==References== </nowiki>{{tlx|reflist}} added\n# Review and maintain article conformation to template\n# Review and verify talk page template usage\n# Review and verify appropriateness of content\n# Assist in the dissemination of information about project goals and guidelines\n\n==Members==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[User:Adamfinmo|Adam F]]\n*[[User:Arch dude|Arch dude]]\n*[[User:Codrinb|Codrinb]]\n*[[User:Deb|Deb]]\n*[[User:Drappel|Drappel]]\n*[[User:Kingturtle|Kingturtle]]\n*[[User:McMarcoP|McMarcoP]]\n*[[User:Mufka|Mufka]]\n*[[User:Natalie Bueno Vasquez|Natalie Bueno Vasquez]]\n*[[User:Toddst1|Toddst1]]\n*[[User:Zzyzx11|Zzyzx11]]\n\n{{Div col end}}\n\nAll members should feel free to add {{tl|User WikiProject Days of the year}} to their userpages.\n\n===Inactive===\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*[[User:Arthur Smart|Art Smart]]\n*[[User:Badbilltucker|Badbilltucker]]\n*[[User:Brianjd|Brianjd]]\n*[[User:Fabricationary|Fabricationary]]\n*[[User:Fimatic|Fimatic]]\n*[[User:Icelilly|Icelilly]]\n*[[User:Jared Preston|Jared Preston]]\n*[[User:Jim Douglas|Jim Douglas]]\n*[[User:Jordan Timothy James Busson|Jordan Timothy James Busson]]\n*[[User:Kentholke|Ken Tholke]]\n*[[User:Mighty Pies|Mighty Pies]]\n*[[User:Reddi|J.
