Symphonic repertoire often involves separate parts for trumpet and cornet. As several instrument builders made improvements to both instruments, they started to look and sound more alike. The modern day cornet is used in [[Brass band (British style)|brass band]]s, [[concert band]]s, and in specific [[orchestra]]l repertoire that requires a more mellow sound.<ref name=\"American\">''The American History and Encyclopedia of Music'', W.C. Hubbard (ed.), \"Musical Instruments\", George W. Andrews, Irving Square, NY, NY, 1924</ref>\n\nThe name cornet derives from corne, meaning ''horn'', itself from Latin cornu. While not musically related, instruments of the [[cornett|Zink]] family (which includes [[Serpent (musical instrument)|serpents]]) are named \"cornetto\" or \"cornett\" in modern English to distinguish them from the valved cornet described here. The 11th edition of the ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'' referred to serpents as \"old wooden cornets\".<ref name=\"EB1\">''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Hugh Chisolm (ed.),  NY, NY, 1911, p. 675</ref> The Roman/Etruscan [[cornu (horn)|cornu]] (or simply \"horn\") is the lingual ancestor of these. It is a predecessor of the [[post horn]] from which the cornet evolved and was used like a bugle to signal orders on the battlefield.<ref name=\"American\"/>\n\nThe instrument was once sometimes referred to as a cornopean, referencing the earliest cornets with the [[St\u00f6lzel valve system]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n==Relationship to trumpet==\nThe cornet was invented by adding valves to the [[post horn]] in circa 1828.<ref name=\"NPDM\">{{cite book | title=The New Penguin Dictionary of Music | page=195 | author=Griffiths, Paul | location=London | publisher=Penguin Books | year=2006 | isbn=0-141-00925-X }}</ref>  The valves allowed for melodic playing throughout the register of the cornet. Trumpets were slower to adopt the new valve technology, so for the next 100 years or more, composers often wrote separate parts for trumpet and cornet. The trumpet would play [[fanfare]]-like passages, while the cornet played more melodic passages. The modern trumpet has valves that allow it to play the same notes and fingerings as the cornet.<ref>''The Technique of Orchestration'', Kent Wheeler Kennan, Prentice Hall, NY, NY 1952, {{Page needed|date=October 2017}}.</ref>\n\nCornets and trumpets made in a given [[Key (music)|key]] (usually the key of B{{music|flat}}) play at the same pitch, and the technique for playing the instruments is nearly identical.  However, cornets and trumpets are not entirely interchangeable, as they differ in [[timbre]]. Also available, but usually seen only in the brass band, is an E{{music|flat}} soprano model, pitched a fourth above the standard B{{music|flat}}.\n\nUnlike the trumpet, which has a cylindrical bore up to the bell section, the tubing of the cornet has a mostly conical bore, starting very narrow at the [[Mouthpiece (brass)|mouthpiece]] and gradually widening towards the bell. Cornets following the 1913 patent of [[E.A. Couturier]] can have a continuously conical bore. The conical bore of the cornet is primarily responsible for its characteristic warm, mellow tone, which can be distinguished from the more penetrating sound of the trumpet. The conical bore of the cornet also makes it more agile than the trumpet when playing fast passages, but correct pitching is often less assured.<ref name=\"American\"/> The cornet is often preferred for young beginners as it is easier to hold, with its centre of gravity much closer to the player.\n\nThe cornet mouthpiece has a shorter and narrower shank than that of a trumpet so it can fit the cornet's smaller mouthpiece receiver. The cup size is  often deeper than that of a trumpet mouthpiece.<ref name=\"EB1\"/>\n\n[[File:Cornet2.png|thumb|Short model traditional cornet, also known as a ''\"Shepherd's Crook\"'' shaped model (Webster's Dictionary 1911).]]\n\nOne variety is the short model traditional cornet, also known as a ''\"Shepherd's Crook\"'' shaped model. These are most often large\u2013bore instruments with a rich mellow sound. There is also a long-model or \"American-wrap\" cornet, often with a smaller bore and a brighter sound, which is produced in a variety of different tubing wraps and is closer to a trumpet in appearance. The Shepherd's Crook model is preferred by cornet traditionalists. The long-model cornet is generally used in concert bands in the United States, but has found little following in British-style brass and concert bands.<ref>Advertisement for the \"King\" Long Model Cornet, [[H.N.

The second bell has a sound similar to that of a [[Harmon mute]] and is typically used to play echo phrases, whereupon the player imitates the sound from the primary bell using the echo chamber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vintagecornets.com/html/echo_cornets.htm|title=Echo Cornets|author=|date=|website=www.vintagecornets.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110153603/http://www.vintagecornets.com/html/echo_cornets.htm|archivedate=10 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Playing technique==\n[[File:Connie Jones Silver Cornet.jpg|thumb|right|[[Connie Jones]] playing a long-model cornet.]]\nLike the trumpet and all other modern brass wind instruments, the cornet makes a sound when the player vibrates (\"buzzes\") the lips in the mouthpiece, creating a vibrating column of air in the tubing. The [[frequency]] of the air column's vibration can be modified by changing the lip tension and aperture or \"[[embouchure]]\", and by altering the tongue position to change the shape of the oral cavity, thereby increasing or decreasing the speed of the airstream. In addition, the column of air can be lengthened by engaging one or more valves, thus lowering the pitch. [[double tonguing|Double and triple tonguing]] are also possible.\n\nWithout valves, the player could produce only a [[Harmonic series (music)|harmonic series]] of notes like those played by the [[Bugle (instrument)|bugle]] and other \"natural\" brass instruments. These notes are far apart for most of the instrument's range, making [[diatonic and chromatic]] playing impossible except in the extreme high register. The valves change the length of the vibrating column and provide the cornet with the ability to play chromatically.<ref name=\"EB1\"/>\n\n==Ensembles with cornets==\n\n===Brass band===\n[[British brass band]]s consist only of brass instruments and a [[Percussion instrument|percussion]] section. The cornet is the leading melodic instrument in this ensemble; trumpets are never used. The ensemble consists of about thirty musicians, including nine B{{music|flat}} cornets and one E{{music|flat}} cornet ([[soprano cornet]]). In the UK, companies such as [[Besson (company)|Besson]] and [[Boosey & Hawkes]] specialized in instrument for brass bands. In America, 19th-century manufacturers such as Graves and Company, Hall and Quinby, E.G. Wright and the [[Boston Musical Instrument Company|Boston Musical Instrument Manufactury]] made instruments for this ensemble.\n\n===Concert band===\nThe cornet features in the British-style [[concert band]], and early American [[concert band]] pieces, particularly those written or transcribed before 1960, often feature distinct, separate parts for trumpets and cornets. Cornet parts are rarely included in later American pieces, however, and cornets are replaced in modern American bands by the [[trumpet]]. This slight difference in instrumentation derives from the British concert band's heritage in [[military band]]s, where the highest brass instrument is always the cornet. There are usually four to six B{{music|flat}} cornets present in a British concert band, but no E{{music|flat}} instrument, as this role is taken by the [[E-flat clarinet|E{{music|flat}} clarinet]].\n\n===Fanfare orkest===\nFanfare orkesten (\"[[fanfare orchestra]]s\"), found in only the Netherlands, Belgium, Northern France and Lithuania, use the complete [[saxhorn]] family of instruments. The standard instrumentation includes both the cornet and the trumpet; however, in recent decades, the cornet has largely been replaced by the trumpet.\n\n===Jazz ensemble===\nIn old style [[jazz band]]s, the cornet was preferred to the trumpet, but from the swing era onwards, it has been largely replaced by the louder, more piercing trumpet.  Likewise the cornet has been largely phased out of [[big band]]s by a growing taste for louder and more aggressive instruments, especially since the advent of [[bebop]] in the post [[World War II]] era.\n\nLegendary jazz pioneer [[Buddy Bolden]] played the cornet, and [[Louis Armstrong]] started off on the cornet but his switch to the trumpet is often credited with beginning of the trumpet\u2019s dominance in jazz.<ref>{{cite web |last1=West |first1=Michael J. |title=The Cornet: Secrets of the Little Big Horn |url=https://jazztimes.com/features/cornet-horn-trumpet/ |website=JazzTimes.com |accessdate=17 August 2018 |date=3 November 2017}}</ref> Cornetists such as [[Bubber Miley]] and [[Rex Stewart]] contributed substantially to the [[Duke Ellington Orchestra]]'s early sound. Other influential jazz cornetists include [[King Oliver]], [[Bix Beiderbecke]], [[Ruby Braff]], [[Bobby Hackett]], and [[Nat Adderley]]. Notable performances on cornet by players generally associated with the trumpet include [[Freddie Hubbard]]'s on ''[[Empyrean Isles]]'' by [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Don Cherry (trumpeter)|Don Cherry]]'s on ''[[The Shape of Jazz to Come]]'' by [[Ornette Coleman]].\n\n==Notable cornetists==\n\n===Historic===\n*[[Nat Adderley]], jazz artist and brother of the famous alto saxophonist [[Cannonball Adderley]],\n*[[Jean-Baptiste Arban]], one of the most influential cornet performers and pedagogues,\n*[[Louis Armstrong]], [[trumpet]] player and singer, and one of the most influential artists in the history of jazz and American music, who, early on in his career, played the cornet before switching over to the trumpet.\n*[[Bix Beiderbecke]], one of the best known jazz cornet players, he had a huge influence on many future jazz musicians\n*[[Buddy Bolden]], often considered the father of jazz, although his playing is unrecorded.\n*[[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]] was one of the major innovators of the free jazz, and world music pioneer, famous for his work with Ornette Coleman; also a proponent of the [[pocket trumpet]].\n*[[Herbert Lincoln Clarke]], one of the finest cornet soloists (for [[Patrick Gilmore]], [[Victor Herbert]], and [[John Philip Sousa]]) and band leaders at the turn of the 20th century.\n*[[Bobby Hackett]], a swing-era cornet (and trumpet) player associated with [[Glenn Miller]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Vic Schoen]], and [[Jackie Gleason]]\n*[[W.C.

Sir [[William Phips]], governor of the newly chartered [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], appointed his lieutenant governor, [[William Stoughton (Massachusetts)|William Stoughton]], as head of a special witchcraft tribunal and then as chief justice of the colonial courts, where he presided over the witch trials. According to George Bancroft, Mather had been influential in gaining the politically unpopular Stoughton his appointment as lieutenant governor under Phips through the intervention of Mather's own politically powerful father, Increase. \"Intercession had been made by Cotton Mather for the advancement of Stoughton, a man of cold affections, proud, self-willed and covetous of distinction.\"{{Sfn|Bancroft|1874\u20131878|p=83}} Apparently Mather saw in Stoughton, a bachelor who had never wed, an ally for church-related matters. Bancroft quotes Mather's reaction to Stoughton's appointment as follows:\n\n{{quote|\"The time for a favor is come\", exulted Cotton Mather; \"Yea, the set time is come.\"{{Sfn|Bancroft|1874\u20131878|p=84}}}}\n\nMather claimed not to have attended the trials in Salem (although his father attended the trial of [[George Burroughs]]). His contemporaries Calef and [[Thomas Brattle]] place him at the executions (see below). Mather began to publicize and celebrate the trials well before they were put to an end: \"If in the midst of the many Dissatisfaction among us, the publication of these Trials may promote such a pious Thankfulness unto God, for Justice being so far executed among us, I shall Re-joyce that God is Glorified.\" Mather called himself a historian not an advocate but, according to one modern writer, his writing largely presumes the guilt of the accused and includes such comments as calling Martha Carrier \"a rampant hag\". Mather referred to George Burroughs<ref>Burroughs was a Harvard alumnus who survived Indian attacks in [[Maine]]. He was an unordained minister hanged the same day as Martha Carrier, John Proctor, George Jacobs, and John Willard</ref> as a \"very puny man\" whose \"tergiversations, contradictions, and falsehoods\" made his testimony not \"worth considering\".<ref>Stacy Schiff. \"The Witches of Salem: Diabolical doings in a Puritan village\", ''The New Yorker'', September 7, 2015, pp. 46-55.</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=[[Wonders of the Invisible World]]}}.</ref>{{Page needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Caution on the use of spectral evidence===\nThe afflicted girls claimed that the semblance of a defendant, invisible to any but themselves, was tormenting them; this was considered evidence of witchcraft, despite the defendant's denial and profession of strongly held Christian beliefs. On May 31, 1692, Mather wrote to one of the judges, [[John Richards (colonial judge)|John Richards]], a member of his congregation,{{Sfn|Upham|1869}}{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} expressing his support of the prosecutions, but cautioning; \"do not lay more stress on pure [[spectral evidence]] than it will bear \u2026 It is very certain that the Devils have sometimes represented the Shapes of persons not only innocent, but also very virtuous.

The original full version of the letter was reprinted in late 1692 in the final two pages of [[Increase Mather]]'s ''Cases of Conscience''. It is a curious document and remains a source of confusion and argument. Calef calls it \"perfectly Ambidexter, giving as great as greater Encouragement to proceed in those dark methods, then cautions against them\u2026 indeed the Advice then given, looks most like a thing of his Composing, as carrying both Fire to increase and Water to quench the Conflagration.\"{{Sfn|Upham|1859}}{{Sfn|Calef|1823|pages=301\u201303}}  It seems likely that the \"Several\" ministers consulted did not agree, and thus Cotton Mather's construction and presentation of the advice could have been crucial to its interpretation.\n\n[[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] summarized the Return, \"The two first and the last sections of this advice took away the force of all the others, and the prosecutions went on with more vigor than before.\" Reprinting the Return five years later in his anonymously published ''Life of Phips'' (1697), Cotton Mather omitted the fateful \"two first and the last\" sections, though they were the ones he had already given most attention in his \"Wonders of the Invisible World\" rushed into publication in the summer and early autumn of 1692.\n\nOn August 19, 1692, Mather attended the execution of George Burroughs<ref>Three independent contemporary sources place him there: Thomas Brattle, Samuel Sewall, and Robert Calef. Brattle refers to him \"C.M.\" in Burr ''Narratives'' (Scribner, 1914) p. 177. Calef's account is also reprinted in Burr \"Narratives\" p. 360. Diary of Samuel Sewall (MHS, Boston, 1878) p. 363</ref> (and four others who were executed after Mather spoke) and Robert Calef presents him as playing a direct and influential role:\n\n{{quote|Mr. Buroughs [sic] was carried in a Cart with others, through the streets of Salem, to Execution. When he was upon the Ladder, he made a speech for the clearing of his Innocency, with such Solemn and Serious Expressions as were to the Admiration of all present; his Prayer (which he concluded by repeating the Lord's Prayer) [as witches were not supposed to be able to recite] was so well worded, and uttered with such composedness as such fervency of spirit, as was very Affecting, and drew Tears from many, so that if seemed to some that the spectators would hinder the execution. The accusers said the black Man [Devil] stood and dictated to him. As soon as he was turned off [hanged], Mr. Cotton Mather, being mounted upon a Horse, addressed himself to the People, partly to declare that he [Mr. Burroughs] was no ordained Minister, partly to possess the People of his guilt, saying that the devil often had been transformed into the Angel of Light. And this did somewhat appease the People, and the Executions went on; when he [Mr. Burroughs] was cut down, he was dragged by a Halter to a Hole, or Grave, between the Rocks, about two feet deep; his Shirt and Breeches being pulled off, and an old pair of Trousers of one Executed put on his lower parts: he was so put in, together with [John] Willard and [Martha] Carrier, that one of his Hands, and his Chin, and a Foot of one of them, was left uncovered.}}\n\n[[File:C.

[[Increase Mather]] was said to have publicly burned Calef's book in Harvard Yard around the time he was removed from the head of the college and replaced by [[Samuel Willard]].<ref>MHS secretary John Eliot seems to be the first to make this claim in \"Biographical Dictionary\" (Boston and Salem, 1809) PD available online. p 95-6.</ref>{{Sfn|Lovelace|1979|p=22}}\n\n===Poole vs. Upham===\nIn 1869, [[William Frederick Poole]] quoted from various school textbooks of the time demonstrating they were in agreement on Cotton Mather's role in the Witch Trials:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nIf anyone imagines that we are stating the case too strongly, let him try an experiment with the first bright boy he meets by asking,...\n'Who got up Salem Witchcraft?'... he will reply, 'Cotton Mather'. Let him try another boy...\n'Who was Cotton Mather?' and the answer will come, 'The man who was on horseback, and hung witches.'<ref>{{cite book|last=Poole|first=William Frederick|title=Cotton Mather and Salem Witchcraft|year=1869|publisher=University Press: Welch, Bigelow, & Co.|location=Cambridge|page=67}}</ref></poem></blockquote>\n\nPoole was a librarian, and a lover of literature, including Mather's ''Magnalia'' \"and other books and tracts, numbering nearly 400 [which] were never so prized by collectors as today.\" Poole announced his intention to redeem Mather's name, using as a springboard a harsh critique of a recently published tome by [[Charles Wentworth Upham]], ''Salem Witchcraft Volumes I and II With an Account of Salem Village and a History of Opinions on Witchcraft and Kindred Subjects'', which runs to almost 1,000 pages, and a quick search of the name Mather (referring to either father, son, or ancestors) shows that it occurs 96 times. Poole's critique, in book form, runs less than 70 pages but the name \"Mather\" occurs many more times than the other book, which is more than ten times as long. Upham shows a balanced and complicated view of Cotton Mather, such as this first mention: \"One of Cotton Mather's most characteristic productions is the tribute to his venerated master. It flows from a heart warm with gratitude.\"\n\nUpham's book refers to [[Robert Calef]] no fewer than 25 times with the majority of these regarding documents compiled by Calef in the mid-1690s and stating: \"Although zealously devoted to the work of exposing the enormities connected with the witchcraft prosecutions, there is no ground to dispute the veracity of Calef as to matters of fact.\" He goes on to say that Calef's collection of writings \"gave a shock to Mather's influence, from which it never recovered.\"\n\nCalef produced only the one book; he is self-effacing and apologetic for his limitations, and on the title page he is listed not as author but \"collector\". Poole, champion of literature, cannot accept Calef whose \"faculties, as indicated by his writings appear to us to have been of an inferior order;\u2026\", and his book \"in our opinion, has a reputation much beyond its merits.\" Poole refers to Calef as Mather's \"personal enemy\" and opens a line, \"Without discussing the character and motives of Calef\u2026\" but does not follow up on this suggestive comment to discuss any actual or purported motive or reason to impugn Calef. Upham responded to Poole (referring to Poole as \"the Reviewer\") in a book running five times as long and sharing the same title but with the clauses reversed: Salem Witchcraft and Cotton Mather.Many of Poole's arguments were addressed, but both authors emphasize the importance of Cotton Mather's difficult and contradictory view on spectral evidence, as copied in the final pages, called \"The Return of Several Ministers\", of Increase Mather's \"Cases of Conscience\".<ref>{{Citation|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/mather/mather.html|title=Witchcraft|last=Mather|publisher=University of Virginia}}.</ref>\n\n===The debate continues: Kittredge vs. Burr===\nEvidenced by the published opinion in the years that followed the Poole vs Upham debate, it would seem Upham was considered the clear winner (see Sibley, GH Moore, WC Ford, and GH Burr below.).  In 1891, Harvard English professor Barrett Wendall wrote [https://books.google.com/books/about/Cotton_Mather_the_Puritan_Priest.html?id=PD8NAAAAYAAJ ''Cotton Mather, The Puritan Priest'']. His book often expresses agreement with Upham but also announces an intention to show Cotton Mather in a more positive light. \"[Cotton Mather] gave utterance to many hasty things not always consistent with fact or with each other\u2026\" And some pages later: \"[Robert] Calef\u2019s temper was that of the rational Eighteenth century; the Mathers belonged rather to the Sixteenth, the age of passionate religious enthusiasm.\"\n\nIn 1907, George Lyman Kittredge published an essay that would become foundational to a major change in the 20th-century view of witchcraft and Mather culpability therein. Kittredge is dismissive of Robert Calef, and sarcastic toward Upham, but shows a fondness for Poole and a similar soft touch toward Cotton Mather. Responding to Kittredge in 1911, [[George Lincoln Burr]], a historian at Cornell, published an [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44817262.pdf essay] that begins in a professional and friendly fashion toward both Poole and Kittredge, but quickly becomes a passionate and direct criticism, stating that Kittredge in the \"zeal of his apology\u2026 reached results so startlingly new, so contradictory of what my own lifelong study in this field has seemed to teach, so unconfirmed by further research\u2026 and withal so much more generous to our ancestors than I can find it in my conscience to deem fair, that I should be less than honest did I not seize this earliest opportunity share with you the reasons for my doubts\u2026\"<ref>GL Burr, England's Place in the History of Witchcraft\" AAS, pp 4-5. These page numbers refer to original book format, available PD online.  Also see link to PDF from AAS.</ref> (In referring to \"ancestors\" Burr primarily means the Mathers, as is made clear in the substance of the essay.) The final paragraph of Burr's 1911 essay pushes these men's debate into the realm of a progressive creed\n\n<blockquote>\u2026 I fear that they who begin by excusing their ancestors may end by excusing themselves.<ref>GL Burr, NE Place in Witchcraft, 1911, p 35.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPerhaps as a continuation of his argument, in 1914, [[George Lincoln Burr]] published a large compilation \"Narratives\". This book arguably continues to be the single most cited reference on the subject. Unlike Poole and Upham, Burr avoids forwarding his previous debate with Kittredge directly into his book and mentions Kittredge only once, briefly in a footnote citing both of their essays from 1907 and 1911, but without further comment.<ref>Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648\u20131706. PD available online. p xxi footnote 1.</ref> But in addition to the viewpoint displayed by Burr's selections, he weighs in on the Poole vs Upham debate at various times, including siding with Upham in a note on [[Thomas Brattle]]'s letter, \"The strange suggestion of W. F. Poole that Brattle here means Cotton Mather himself, is adequately answered by Upham\u2026\"<ref>Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648\u20131706. PD available online. p 188 footnote 3.</ref> Burr's \"Narratives\" reprint a lengthy but abridged portion of Calef's book and introducing it he digs deep into the historical record for information on Calef and concludes \"\u2026that he had else any grievance against the Mathers or their colleagues there is no reason to think.\" Burr finds that a comparison between Calef's work and original documents in the historical record collections \"testify to the care and exactness\u2026\"<ref>Burr, George Lincoln. Narrative of Witchcraft Cases 1648\u20131706. PD available online. p 293.</ref>\n\n===20th century revision: The Kittredge lineage at Harvard===\n\n<blockquote>1920\u20133 [[Secret Court of 1920|Kenneth B. Murdock]] wrote a doctoral dissertation on Increase Mather advised by [[Secret Court of 1920|Chester Noyes Greenough]] and Kittredge. Murdock's father was a banker hired in 1920 to run the Harvard Press<ref>Max Hall ''Harvard University Press A History'' 1986 Harvard University Press Cambridge MA p 43, 61</ref> and he published his son's dissertation as a handsome volume in 1925: ''Increase Mather, The Foremost American Puritan'' (Harvard University Press). Kittredge was right hand man to the elder Murdock at the Press.<ref>Max Hall ''Harvard University Press'', p 43, 61.</ref> This work focuses on Increase Mather and is more critical of the son, but the following year he published a selection of Cotton Mather's writings with an introduction that claims Cotton Mather was \"not less but more humane than his contemporaries. Scholars have demonstrated that his advice to the witch judges was always that they should be more cautious in accepting evidence\" against the accused.<ref>K Murdock ''Selections from Cotton Mather'' (Hafner, New York, 1926). See introduction.</ref> Murdock's statement seems to claim a majority view. But one wonders who Murdock would have meant by \"scholars\" at this time other than Poole, Kittredge, and TJ Holmes (below)<ref>For contrast, see Herbert Schneider, of Columbia University, who in 1930 described the Mathers as \"smug ministers of God\" whose misdeeds in 1692 \"put an official end to the theocracy.\" Schneider, Herbert Wallace, ''The Puritan Mind'', Henry Holt & Co, 1930, p. 92.</ref> and Murdock's obituary calls him a pioneer \"in the reversal of a movement among historians of American culture to discredit the Puritan and colonial period\u2026\"<ref>http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44517578.pdf</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>1924 [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44539299.pdf Thomas J. Holmes] was an Englishman with no college education, but he apprenticed in bookbinding and emigrated to the U.S. and become the librarian at the William G. Mather Library in Ohio <ref>See link above containing obituary by CK Shipley in AAS Proceedings.</ref> where he likely met Murdock. In 1924, Holmes wrote an essay for the Bibliographical Society of America identifying himself as part of the Poole-Kittredge lineage and citing Kenneth B. Murdock's still unpublished dissertation. In 1932 Holmes published a bibliography of Increase Mather followed by ''Cotton Mather, A Bibliography'' (1940). Holmes often cites Murdock and Kittredge and is highly knowledgeable about the construction of books. Holmes' work also includes Cotton Mather\u2019s October 20, 1692 letter (see above) to his uncle opposing an end to the trials.</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote> 1930 Samuel Eliot Morison published ''Builders of the Bay Colony.'' Morison chose not to include anyone with the surname Mather or Cotton in his collection of twelve \"builders\" and in the bibliography writes \"I have a higher opinion than most historians of Cotton Mather's ''Magnalia''\u2026 Although Mather is inaccurate, pedantic, and not above ''suppresio veri'', he does succeed in giving a living picture of the person he writes about.\" Whereas Kittredge and Murdock worked from the English department, Morison was from Harvard's history department. Morison's view seems to have evolved over the course of the 1930s, as can be seen in ''Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century'' (1936) published while Kittredge ran the Harvard press, and in a year that coincided with the tercentary of the college: \"Since the appearance of Professor Kittredge's work, it is not necessary to argue that a man of learning\u2026\" of that era should be judged on his view of witchcraft.<ref>Morison, Samuel E ''Harvard College in the Seventeenth Century'' Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 1936 p 494-497</ref> In ''The Intellectual Life of Colonial New England'' (1956), Morison writes that Cotton Mather found balance and level-thinking during the witchcraft trials.

By July 1716, he had read an endorsement of inoculation by Dr Emanuel Timonius of Constantinople in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]''. Mather then declared, in a letter to Dr [[John Woodward (naturalist)|John Woodward]] of [[Gresham College]] in London, that he planned to press Boston's doctors to adopt the practice of inoculation should smallpox reach the colony again.<ref>Blake 1952, pp. 490\u201391</ref>\n\nBy 1721, a whole generation of young Bostonians was vulnerable and memories of the last epidemic's horrors had by and large disappeared.<ref>Winslow 1974, pp. 24\u201329</ref> On April 22 of that year, the HMS ''Seahorse'' arrived from the West Indies carrying smallpox on board. Despite attempts to protect the town through quarantine, eight known cases of smallpox appeared in Boston by May 27, and by mid-June, the disease was spreading at an alarming rate. As a new wave of smallpox hit the area and continued to spread, many residents fled to outlying rural settlements. The combination of exodus, quarantine, and outside traders' fears disrupted business in the capital of the Bay Colony for weeks. Guards were stationed at the House of Representatives to keep Bostonians from entering without special permission. The death toll reached 101 in September, and the [[Selectmen]], powerless to stop it, \"severely limited the length of time funeral bells could toll.\"<ref name=\"Blake 1952, 4952\">Blake 1952, p. 495</ref> As one response, legislators delegated a thousand pounds from the treasury to help the people who, under these conditions, could no longer support their families.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nOn June 6, 1721, Mather sent an abstract of reports on inoculation by Timonius and Jacobus Pylarinus to local physicians, urging them to consult about the matter.

All recovered in about a week. Boylston inoculated seven more people by mid-July. The epidemic peaked in October 1721, with 411 deaths; by February 26, 1722, Boston was again free from smallpox.

At the extreme, in November 1721, someone hurled a lighted grenade into Mather's home.{{Sfn|Blake|1952|p=495}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/special-edition-on-infectious-disease/2014/the-fight-over-inoculation-during-the-1721-boston-smallpox-epidemic|date=December 31, 2014|title=The Fight Over Inoculation During the 1721 Boston Smallpox Epidemic|publisher=Harvard University|first=Matthew|last=Niederhuber}}</ref>\n\n====Medical opposition====\nSeveral opponents of smallpox inoculation, among them John Williams, stated that there were only two laws of physick (medicine): sympathy and antipathy. In his estimation, inoculation was neither a sympathy toward a wound or a disease, or an antipathy toward one, but the creation of one. For this reason, its practice violated the natural laws of medicine, transforming health care practitioners into those who harm rather than heal.{{Sfn|Williams|1721|p=13}}\n\nAs with most colonists, Williams' Puritan beliefs were enmeshed in every aspect of his life, and he used the [[Bible]] to state his case. He quoted [[Matthew 9:12]], when [[Jesus]] said: \"It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick.\" Dr. [[William Douglass (physician)|William Douglass]] proposed a more [[secular]] argument against inoculation, stressing the importance of reason over passion and urging the public to be pragmatic in their choices. In addition, he demanded that ministers leave the practice of medicine to physicians, and not meddle in areas where they lacked expertise. According to Douglass, smallpox inoculation was \"a medical experiment of consequence,\" one not to be undertaken lightly. He believed that not all learned individuals were qualified to doctor others, and while ministers took on several roles in the early years of the colony, including that of caring for the sick, they were now expected to stay out of state and civil affairs. Douglass felt that inoculation caused more deaths than it prevented. The only reason Mather had had success in it, he said, was because Mather had used it on children, who are naturally more resilient. Douglass vowed to always speak out against \"the wickedness of spreading infection\".{{Sfn|Douglass|1722|p=11}} Speak out he did: \"The battle between these two prestigious adversaries [Douglass and Mather] lasted far longer than the epidemic itself, and the literature accompanying the controversy was both vast and venomous.\"{{Sfn|Van de Wetering|1985|p=46}}\n\n====Puritan resistance====\nGenerally, Puritan pastors favored the inoculation experiments. Increase Mather, Cotton's father, was joined by prominent pastors Benjamin Colman and William Cooper in openly propagating the use of inoculations.<ref>Stout, ''The New England Soul'', p. 102</ref> \"One of the classic assumptions of the Puritan mind was that the will of God was to be discerned in nature as well as in revelation.\"<ref>{{Citation|first=Alan|last=Heimert|title=Religion and the American Mind|page=5}}.<!-- publishing info, ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Nevertheless, Williams questioned whether the smallpox \"is not one of the strange works of God; and whether inoculation of it be not a fighting with the most High.\" He also asked his readers if the smallpox epidemic may have been given to them by God as \"punishment for sin,\" and warned that attempting to shield themselves from God's fury (via inoculation), would only serve to \"provoke him more\".{{Sfn|Williams|1721|p=4}}\n\nPuritans found meaning in affliction, and they did not yet know why God was showing them disfavor through smallpox. Not to address their errant ways before attempting a cure could set them back in their \"errand\". Many Puritans believed that creating a wound and inserting poison was doing violence and therefore was antithetical to the healing art. They grappled with adhering to the [[Ten Commandments]], with being proper church members and good caring neighbors. The apparent contradiction between harming or murdering a neighbor through inoculation and the Sixth Commandment\u2014\"thou shalt not kill\"\u2014seemed insoluble and hence stood as one of the main objections against the procedure. Williams maintained that because the subject of inoculation could not be found in the Bible, it was not the will of God, and therefore \"unlawful.\"<ref>Williams 1721, p. 2</ref> He explained that inoculation violated [[The Golden Rule]], because if one neighbor voluntarily infected another with disease, he was not doing unto others as he would have done to him. With the Bible as the Puritans' source for all decision-making, lack of scriptural evidence concerned many, and Williams vocally scorned Mather for not being able to reference an inoculation edict directly from the Bible.<ref>Williams 1721, p. 14</ref>\n\n====Inoculation defended====\nWith the smallpox epidemic catching speed and racking up a staggering death toll, a solution to the crisis was becoming more urgently needed by the day. The use of quarantine and various other efforts, such as balancing the body's [[humors]], did not slow the spread of the disease. As news rolled in from town to town and correspondence arrived from overseas, reports of horrific stories of suffering and loss due to smallpox stirred mass panic among the people. \"By circa 1700, smallpox had become among the most devastating of epidemic diseases circulating in the Atlantic world.\"{{Sfn|Gronim|2007|p=248}}\n\nMather strongly challenged the perception that inoculation was against the will of God and argued the procedure was not outside of Puritan principles. He wrote that \"whether a Christian may not employ this Medicine (let the matter of it be what it will) and humbly give Thanks to God's good Providence in discovering of it to a miserable World; and humbly look up to His Good Providence (as we do in the use of any other Medicine) It may seem strange, that any wise Christian cannot answer it. And how strangely do Men that call themselves Physicians betray their Anatomy, and their Philosophy, as well as their Divinity in their invectives against this Practice?\"{{Sfn|Mather|1721|page=25, n. 15}} The Puritan minister began to embrace the sentiment that smallpox was an inevitability for anyone, both the good and the wicked, yet God had provided them with the means to save themselves. Mather reported that, from his view, \"none that have used it ever died of the Small Pox, tho at the same time, it were so malignant, that at least half the People died, that were infected With it in the Common way.\"{{Sfn|Mather|1721|p=2}}\n\nWhile Mather was experimenting with the procedure, prominent Puritan pastors Benjamin Colman and William Cooper expressed public and theological support for them.<ref>{{Citation|first=William|last=Cooper|title=A Letter from a Friend in the Country, Attempting a Solution of the Scruples and Objections of a Conscientious or Religious Nature, Commonly Made Against the New Way of Receiving the Small Pox|place=Boston|publisher=S.

Although many were initially wary of the concept, it was because people were able to witness the procedure's consistently positive results, within their own community of ordinary citizens, that it became widely utilized and supported. One important change in the practice after 1721 was regulated [[quarantine]] of innoculees.{{Sfn|Van de Wetering|1985|page=66, n. 55}}\n\n===The aftermath===\nAlthough Mather and Boylston were able to demonstrate the efficacy of the practice, the debate over inoculation would continue even beyond the epidemic of 1721\u201322.

However, other critics have praised Mather's work, citing it as one of the best efforts at properly documenting the establishment of America and growth of the people.{{Sfn|Halttunen|1978|p=311}}\n\n===''The Christian Philosopher''===\nIn 1721, Mather published ''The Christian Philosopher'', the first systematic book on science published in America. Mather attempted to show how Newtonian science and religion were in harmony. It was in part based on [[Robert Boyle]]'s ''[[The Christian Virtuoso]]'' (1690). Mather reportedly took inspiration from ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'', by the 12th-century Islamic philosopher Abu Bakr [[Ibn Tufail]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nDespite condemning the \"Mahometans\" as infidels, Mather viewed the novel's protagonist, Hayy, as a model for his ideal Christian philosopher and monotheistic scientist. Mather viewed Hayy as a [[noble savage]] and applied this in the context of attempting to understand the Native American Indians, in order to convert them to Puritan Christianity. Mather's short treatise on the [[Lord's Supper]] was later translated by his nephew [[Josiah Cotton]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=To every tribe|work=Josiah Cotton|title=Thanksgiving's Wampanoag call: Come Over and Help Us!|url=http://www.toeverytribe.org/tag/josiah-cotton|accessdate=September 13, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610050416/http://www.toeverytribe.org/tag/josiah-cotton/|archivedate=June 10, 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{Citation|last=Mather|first=Cotton|authorlink=Cotton Mather|year=2001|origyear=1689|title=A Family, Well-Ordered}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Mather | first = Cotton | year = 1911\u20131912 | author-mask = 3 | author-link = Cotton Mather | title = Diary | publisher = Massachusetts Historical Society | series = Collections | number = vii | volume = vii\u2013viii}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Mather | first = Cotton | year = 1995 | editor-last = Smolinski | editor-first = Reiner | title = The Threefold Paradise of Cotton Mather: An Edition of 'Triparadisus' | place = Athens and London | publisher = University of Georgia Press | isbn = 0-8203-1519-2 | url = http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/etas/48/ | author-mask = 3}}.\n* {{Citation | last = Mather | first = Cotton | year = 2010 | author-mask = 3 | editor-last = Smolinski | editor-first = Reiner | title = Biblia Americana | volume = 1: Genesis | type = edited, with an introduction and annotations | place = Grand Rapids and Tuebingen | publisher = Baker Academic and Mohr Siebeck | isbn = 978-0-8010-3900-3}}.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Calvinism|Biography|United States|Massachusetts|North America}}\n*[[John Ratcliff (bookbinder)|John Ratcliff]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation | last1 = Aronson | first1 = Stanley M | first2 = Lucile | last2 = Newman | year = 2002 | url = http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2002-03/02-017t.html | title = God Have Mercy on This House: Being a Brief Chronicle of Smallpox in Colonial New England | publisher = [[Brown University]] News Service}}.\n* {{Citation | first =George | last = Bancroft |title= History of the United States of America, from the discovery of the American continent |publisher= Little, Brown, & co |location=Boston|date=1874\u20131878 |isbn= 0-665-61404-7}}\n* {{Citation | last = Bercovitch | first = Sacvan | contribution = Cotton Mather | title = Major Writers of Early American Literature | editor-first = Everett | editor-last = Emerson | place = Wisconsin | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1972}}.<!-- ISBN needed -->\n* {{Citation | last = Blake | first = John B | date = December 1952 | title = The Inoculation Controversy in Boston: 1721\u20131722 | journal = The New England Quarterly | volume = 25 | number = 4 | pages = 489\u2013506 | doi=10.2307/362582}}.\n* Boylston, Zabdiel.

Linebarger was a noted [[East Asia]] scholar and expert in [[psychological warfare]]. (\"Cordwainer\" is an archaic word for \"a worker in cordwain or cordovan [[leather]]; a [[shoemaker]]\",<ref name=OED>[[Oxford English Dictionary]]</ref> and a \"smith\" is \"one who works in [[iron]] or other metals; esp. a [[blacksmith]] or [[farrier]]\":<ref name=OED/> two kinds of skilled workers with traditional materials.)\nLinebarger also employed the literary pseudonyms \"Carmichael Smith\" (for his political thriller ''[[Atomsk (novel)|Atomsk]]''), \"Anthony Bearden\" (for his poetry) and \"Felix C. Forrest\" (for the novels ''Ria'' and ''Carola'').  \nHe died of a heart attack in 1966 at [[Johns Hopkins University#Medical|Johns Hopkins University Medical Center]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], at age 53.\n\n==Early life and education==\nLinebarger was born in [[Milwaukee]], Wisconsin. His father was Paul M. W. Linebarger, a lawyer and political activist with close ties to the leaders of the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese revolution of 1911]]. As a result of those connections, Linebarger's [[Godparent|godfather]] was [[Sun Yat-sen]], considered the father of Chinese nationalism.<ref name=JH>Stimpson, Ashley and Irtenkauf, Jeffrey,  [https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2018/fall/cordwainer-smith-paul-linebarger/ \"Throngs of Himself\"], ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', Fall 2018.</ref>\n\nWhile Sun Yat-sen was struggling against contentious warlords in China, Linebarger's father moved his family between a variety of places in Asia, Europe, and the United States and sometimes sent his son to boarding schools for safety; Linebarger attended more than 30 schools. In 1919 at a boarding school in Hawaii he was blinded in his right eye; the vision in his remaining eye was impaired by infection.<ref name=JH/>\n\nLinebarger was familiar with six languages by adulthood. At the age of 23, he received a PhD in Political Science from [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref name=JH/>\n\n==Career==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\nFrom 1937 to 1946, Linebarger held a faculty appointment at [[Duke University]], where he began producing highly regarded works on [[Far Eastern]] affairs.\n\nWhile retaining his professorship at Duke after the beginning of [[World War II]], Linebarger began serving as a second lieutenant of the [[United States Army]], where he was involved in the creation of the [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] and the Operation Planning and Intelligence Board. He also helped organize the Army's first [[psychological warfare]] section. In 1943, he was sent to [[China]] to coordinate military intelligence operations. When he later pursued his interest in China, Linebarger became a close confidant of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. By the end of the war, he had risen to the rank of major.\n\n[[File:Psychological Warfare Linebarger.jpg|frame|left]]\n\nIn 1947, Linebarger moved to the Johns Hopkins University's [[School of Advanced International Studies]] in Washington, DC, where he served as Professor of [[Asiatic Studies]]. He used his experiences in the war to write the book ''Psychological Warfare'' (1948), regarded by many in the field as a classic text.\n\nHe eventually rose to the rank of colonel in the reserves. He was recalled to advise the British forces in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the [[U.S. Eighth Army]] in the [[Korean War]]. While he was known to call himself a \"visitor to small wars\", he refrained from becoming involved in the [[Vietnam War]], but is known to have done work for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]].  In 1969 CIA officer [[Miles Copeland Jr.]] wrote that Linebarger was \"perhaps the leader practitioner of 'black' and 'gray' propaganda in the Western world\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Copeland |first1=Miles, Jr. |authorlink=Miles Copeland Jr.|title=The Game of Nations|date=1969|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=100, 113}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New Book Points Up Middle East Involvement|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/62613878/|accessdate=22 June 2017|publisher=San Antonio Express|date=12 August 1969}}</ref> According to Joseph Burkholder Smith, a former CIA operative, he conducted classes in psychological warfare for CIA agents at his home in Washington under cover of his position at the School of Advanced International Studies.<ref name=JH/> He traveled extensively and became a member of the [[Foreign Policy Association]], and was called upon to advise President [[John F. Kennedy]].\n\n==Marriage and family==\n{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}\nIn 1936, Linebarger married Margaret Snow. They had a daughter in 1942 and another in 1947. They divorced in 1949.\n\nIn 1950, Linebarger married again to Genevieve Collins; they had no children. They remained married until his death from a heart attack in 1966, in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. Linebarger had expressed a wish to retire to Australia, which he had visited in his travels.\n\nColonel Linebarger is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], Section 35, Grave Number 4712. His widow, Genevieve Collins Linebarger, was interred with him on November 16, 1981.<ref>[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/linebarg.htm Paul Myron Anthony Linebarger]</ref>\n\n==Case history debate==\nLinebarger is long rumored to have been \"[[Kirk Allen]]\", the fantasy-haunted subject of [[Kirk Allen|\"The Jet-Propelled Couch,\"]] a chapter in [[psychologist]] [[Robert M. Lindner]]'s best-selling 1954 collection ''The Fifty-Minute Hour.''<ref name=JH/><ref>Lindner, Robert. ''The Fifty-Minute Hour.''

''Billion Year Spree: The True History of Science Fiction.'' New York: Doubleday, 1973.</ref> More recently, both Elms and librarian Lee Weinstein<ref>Weinstein, Lee. \"In Search of Kirk Allen,\" ''New York Review of Science Fiction'', April 2001.</ref> have gathered circumstantial evidence to support the case for Linebarger's being Allen, but both concede there is no direct proof that Linebarger was ever a patient of Lindner's or that he suffered from a disorder similar to that of Kirk Allen.<ref>See also '[http://www.cordwainer-smith.com/scholarly.htm Cordwainer Smith Scholarly Corner] by Alan C. Elms</ref>\n\n==Science fiction style==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2012}}\nAccording to Frederik Pohl\n{{quote|In his stories, which were a wonderful and inimitable blend of a strange, raucous poetry and a detailed technological scene, we begin to read of human beings in worlds so far from our own in space in time that they were no longer quite Earth (even when they were the third planet out from Sol), and the people were no longer quite human, but something perhaps better, certainly different{{r|pohl196612}}}}\n\nLinebarger's identity as \"Cordwainer Smith\" was secret until his death.<ref name=\"pohl196612\">{{Cite magazine |last=Pohl |first=Frederik |date=December 1966 |title=Cordwainer Smith |department=Editorial |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v25n02_1966-12_modified#page/n5/mode/2up |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |page=6 }}</ref>\n\nSmith's stories are unusual, sometimes being written in narrative styles closer to traditional [[Chinese literature|Chinese stories]] than to most English-language fiction, as well as reminiscent of the [[Hikaru Genji|Genji]] tales of [[Lady Murasaki]]. The total volume of his science fiction output is relatively small, because of his time-consuming profession and his early death.\n\nSmith's works consist of: One novel, originally published in two volumes in edited form as ''The Planet Buyer'', also known as ''The Boy Who Bought Old Earth'' (1964) and ''The Underpeople'' (1968), and later restored to its original form as ''[[Norstrilia]]'' (1975); and 32 short stories (collected in ''[[The Rediscovery of Man]]'' (1993), including two versions of the short story \"War No. 81-Q\").\n\nLinebarger's cultural links to China are partially expressed in the pseudonym \"Felix C. Forrest\", which he used in addition to \"Cordwainer Smith\": his godfather [[Sun Yat-Sen]] suggested to Linebarger that he adopt the Chinese name \"Lin Bai-lo\" ({{zh|t=\u6797\u767d\u6a02|s=\u6797\u767d\u4e50|p=L\u00edn B\u00e1il\u00e8}}), which may be roughly translated as \"Forest of Incandescent Bliss\". (\"Felix\" is Latin for \"happy\".) In his later years, Linebarger proudly wore a tie with the Chinese characters for this name embroidered on it.\n\nAs an expert in psychological warfare, Linebarger was very interested in the newly developing fields of [[psychology]] and [[psychiatry]]. He used many of their concepts in his fiction. His fiction often has religious overtones or motifs, particularly evident in characters who have no control over their actions. James B. Jordan argued for the importance of [[Anglicanism]] to Smith's works back to 1949.<ref>Jordan, James B., [http://www.sunpopblue.com/Music-Art-Books/Cordwainer-Smith.html \"Christianity in the Science Fiction of 'Cordwainer Smith'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925221215/http://www.sunpopblue.com/Music-Art-Books/Cordwainer-Smith.html |date=September 25, 2008 }}, ''Contra Mundum'', No. 2 Winter 1992</ref> But Linebarger's daughter Rosana Hart has indicated that he did not become an Anglican until 1950, and was not strongly interested in religion until later still.<ref>[http://www.cordwainer-smith.com/remember.htm \"Biography and memories of Paul M. A. Linebarger, who was Cordwainer Smith]\", www.cordwainer-smith.com</ref> The introduction to the collection ''Rediscovery of Man'' notes that from around 1960 Linebarger became more devout and expressed this in his writing. Linebarger's works are sometimes included in analyses of Christianity in fiction, along with the works of authors such as [[C. S. Lewis]] and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].\n\nMost of Smith's stories are set in an era starting some 14,000 years in the future. The [[Instrumentality of Mankind]] rules Earth and goes on to control other planets later inhabited by humanity. The Instrumentality attempts to revive old cultures and languages in a process known as the Rediscovery of Man. This rediscovery can be seen as the initial period when humankind emerges from a mundane utopia and the nonhuman Underpeople gain freedom from slavery. It may also be viewed as part of a continuing process begun by the Instrumentality, encompassing the whole cycle, where mankind is constantly at risk of falling back into bad old ways.\n\nFor years, Linebarger had a pocket notebook which he had filled with ideas about The Instrumentality and additional stories in the series. But while in a small boat in a lake or bay in the mid 60s, he leaned over the side, and his notebook fell out of his breast pocket into the water, where it was lost forever. Another story claims that he accidentally left the notebook in a restaurant in [[Rhodes]] in 1965. With the book gone, he felt empty of ideas, and decided to start a new series which was an allegory of Mid-Eastern politics.<ref>[http://www.thewaythefutureblogs.com/2010/12/cordwainer-smith-the-ballad-of-lost-linebarger-part-2/ Cordwainer Smith: The Ballad of Lost Linebarger, Part 2]</ref><ref>[http://worldtracker.org/media/library/English%20Literature/S/Smith,%20Cordwainer/Smith,%20Cordwainer%20-%20The%20Rediscovery%20of%20Man.html Cordwainer Smith - The Rediscovery of Man]</ref>\n\nSmith's stories describe a long [[future history]] of Earth. The settings range from a [[postapocalyptic]] landscape with [[walled cities]], defended by agents of the Instrumentality, to a state of sterile utopia, in which freedom can be found only deep below the surface, in long-forgotten and buried [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] strata. These features may place Smith's works within the [[Dying Earth subgenre]] of science fiction. They are ultimately more optimistic and distinctive.\n\nSmith's most celebrated short story is his first-published, \"[[Scanners Live in Vain]]\", which led many of its earliest readers to assume that \"Cordwainer Smith\" was a new pen name for one of the established giants of the genre. It was selected as one of the best science fiction short stories of the pre-[[Nebula Award]] period by the [[Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America]]. It was selected for ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame Volume One, 1929-1964]]''.\n\nSmith's next story did not appear for several years, but readers began recognizing the name on stories and novelettes, often published through ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]''.{{r|pohl196612}} His stories feature strange and vivid creations, such as:\n* The planet Norstrilia (Old North Australia), a semi-arid planet where an immortality drug called ''stroon'' is harvested from gigantic, virus-infected sheep each weighing more than 100 tons. Norstrilians are nominally the richest people in the galaxy and defend their immensely valuable stroon with sophisticated weapons (as shown in the story \"[[Mother Hitton's Littul Kittons]]\"). However, extremely high taxes ensure that everyone on the planet lives a frugal, rural life, like the farmers of old Australia, to keep the Norstrilians tough.\n* The punishment world Shayol (cf. [[Sheol]]), where criminals are punished by the regrowth and harvesting of their organs for transplanting\n* ''Planoforming'' [[spacecraft]], which are crewed by humans telepathically linked with cats to defend against the attacks of malevolent entities in space, which are perceived by the humans as dragons, and by the cats as gigantic rats, in \"The Game of Rat and Dragon\".\n* The ''Underpeople'', animals modified into human form and intelligence to fulfill servile roles, and treated as property. Several stories feature clandestine efforts to liberate the Underpeople and grant them [[civil rights]]. They are seen everywhere throughout regions controlled by the Instrumentality. Names of Underpeople are based on their animal species. Thus C'Mell (\"[[The Ballad of Lost C'Mell]]\") is cat-derived; D'Joan (\"[[The Dead Lady of Clown Town]]\"), a [[Joan of Arc]] figure, is descended from dogs; and B'dikkat (\"[[A Planet Named Shayol]]\") has bovine ancestors.\n* ''Habermans'' and their supervisors, ''Scanners'', who are essential for space travel, but at the cost of having their sensory [[nerve]]s cut to block the \"pain of space\", and who perceive only by vision and various life-support implants. A technological breakthrough removes the need for the treatment, but resistance among the Scanners to their perceived loss of status ensues, forming the basis of the story \"Scanners Live in Vain\".\n* Early works in the timeline include [[neologism]]s which are not explained to any great extent, but serve to produce an atmosphere of strangeness. These words are usually derived from non-English words. For instance, ''manshonyagger'' derives from the German words \"menschen\" meaning, in some senses, \"men\" or \"mankind\", and \"j\u00e4ger\", meaning a hunter, and refers to war machines that roam the wild lands between the walled cities and prey on men, except for those they can identify as Germans. Another example is \"Meeya Meefla\", the only city to have preserved its name from the pre-atomic era: evidently Miami, Florida, from its abbreviated form (as on road signs) \"MIAMI FLA\".\n* Character names in the stories often derive from words in languages other than English. Smith seemed particularly fond of using numbers for this purpose. For instance, the name \"Lord Sto Odin\" in the story \"Under Old Earth\" is derived from the Russian words for \"One hundred and one\", \u0441\u0442\u043e \u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d; it also suggests the name of the Norse god [[Odin]]. Quite a few of the names mean \"five-six\" in different languages, including both the robot Fisi (fi[ve]-si[x]), the dead Lady Panc Ashash (in Sanskrit \"pa\u00f1cha\" [\u092a\u091e\u094d\u091a] is \"five\" and \"\u1e63a\u1e63\" [\u0937\u0937\u094d] is \"six\"), Limaono ([[wikt:lima#Hawaiian|lima]]-[[wikt:ono#Hawaiian|ono]], Hawaiian and/or Fijian), Englok (ng<sup>5</sup>-luk<sup>6</sup> <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikt:\u4e94#Cantonese|\u4e94]]-[[wikt:\u516d#Cantonese|\u516d]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, in Cantonese), Goroke (go-roku <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[wikt:\u4e94#Japanese|\u4e94]]-[[wikt:\u516d#Japanese|\u516d]]<nowiki>]</nowiki>, Japanese) and Femtiosex (\"[[wikt:femtio|fifty]]-[[wikt:sex#Swedish|six]]\" in Swedish) in \"The Dead Lady of Clown Town\" as well as the main character in \"[[Think Blue, Count Two]]\", Veesey-koosey, which is an English transcription of the Finnish words \"[[wikt:viisi|viisi]]\" (five) and \"[[wikt:kuusi|kuusi]]\" (six). Four of the characters in \"Think Blue, Count Two\" are called \"Thirteen\" in different languages: Tiga-belas (both in [[:id:13 (angka)|Indonesian]] and [[:ms:13 (nombor)|Malay]]), Trece ([[wikt:trece|Spanish]]), Talatashar (based on an Arabic dialect form <big>\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b \u0639\u0634\u0631</big>, ''thal\u0101th \u02bfashar'') and Sh'san (based on Mandarin \u5341\u4e09, ''sh\u00eds\u0101n'', where the \"\u00ed\" is never pronounced). Other names, notably that of Lord Jestocost (Russian \u0416\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c, Cruelty), are non-English but not numbers.\n* Remnants of contemporary culture accordingly appear as valued antiquities or sometimes just as unrecognized survivals, lending a rare feeling of nostalgia for the present to the stories.\n\n==Published non-fiction==\n* 1937, ''The Political Doctrines of Sun Yat-Sen: An Exposition of the San Min Chu I'', Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press\n* 1938, ''Government in Republican China'', London: McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-88355-081-4}}\n* 1941, ''The China of Chiang K'ai-shek: A Political Study'', Boston: World Peace Foundation, {{ISBN|0-8371-6779-5}}\n* 1948, ''Psychological Warfare'', Washington: Infantry Journal Press; revised second edition, 1954, New York: Duell, Sloan and Pearce ([http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/48612 available online])\n* 1951, ''Foreign milieux (HBM 200/1)'', Dept. of Defense, Research and Development Board\n* 1951, ''Immediate improvement of theater-level psychological warfare in the Far East'', [[Operations Research Office]], Johns Hopkins University\n* 1954, ''Far Eastern Government and Politics: China and Japan'' (with Djang Chu and Ardath W.

A local society supported the Kyd family financially after the death of the father. Kidd's origins in [[Greenock]] have been dismissed by David Dobson, who found neither the name Kidd nor Kyd in baptismal records; the myth that his \"father was thought to have been a [[Church of Scotland]] minister\" has been discounted, insofar as there is no mention of the name in comprehensive Church of Scotland records for the period.

Some published information suggests that he was a seaman's [[apprentice]] on a pirate ship during this time, before partaking in his more famous seagoing exploits.\n\nBy 1689, Kidd was a member of a French-English pirate crew sailing the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]] under Captain [[Jean Fantin]]. During one of their voyages, Kidd and other crew members mutinied, ousting the captain and sailing to the British colony of [[Nevis]].<ref name=\"The Pirate Hunter\">{{cite book|last1=Zacks|first1=Richard|title=The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd|date=2003|publisher=Hachette Books|location=New York|isbn=9781401398187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbqZAAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=31 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> There they renamed the ship ''[[Blessed William]]'', and Kidd became captain either as a result of election by the ship's crew, or by appointment of Christopher Codrington, governor of the island of Nevis.

It would have been viewed as disloyalty to the crown to turn down this request, carrying much social stigma, making it difficult for Kidd to say no. The request preceded the voyage which established Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and marked his image in history and [[folklore]].\n\nFour-fifths of the cost for the venture was paid for by noble lords, who were among the most powerful men in England: the [[Edward Russell, 1st Earl of Orford|Earl of Orford]], the Baron of Romney, the [[Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury|Duke of Shrewsbury]], and [[John Somers, 1st Baron Somers|Sir John Somers]]. Kidd was presented with a [[letter of marque]], signed personally by King [[William III of England]]. This letter reserved 10% of the loot for the Crown, and Henry Gilbert's ''The Book of Pirates'' suggests that the King may have fronted some of the money for the voyage himself. Kidd and his acquaintance Colonel [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] orchestrated the whole plan, they sought additional funding from a merchant named [[Blackham baronets|Sir Richard Blackham]].<ref>https://www.gilderlehrman.org/content/secret-agreement-between-pirate-hunters-1696</ref> Kidd also had to sell his ship ''Antigua'' to raise funds.\n\nThe new ship, ''[[Adventure Galley]]''<ref>{{cite web| title =Buccaneers and Pirates of Our Coasts\" \"The Real Captain Kidd| author =Frank R. Stockton| publisher =The Baldwin Online Children's Literature Project| url =http://www.mainlesson.com/display.php?author=stockton&book=buccaneers&story=kidd| accessdate =13 December 2007}}</ref> was well suited to the task of catching pirates, weighing over 284 [[Builder's Old Measurement|tons burthen]] and equipped with 34 [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail|cannon]], oars, and 150 men. The oars were a key advantage, as they enabled ''Adventure Galley'' to manoeuvre in a battle when the winds had calmed and other ships were dead in the water. Kidd took pride in personally selecting the crew, choosing only those whom he deemed to be the best and most loyal officers.\n\n{{quote|As the Adventure Galley sailed down the [[Thames]], Kidd unaccountably failed to salute a Navy yacht at Greenwich, as custom dictated. The Navy yacht then fired a shot to make him show respect, and Kidd\u2019s crew responded with an astounding display of impudence \u2013 by turning and slapping their backsides in [disdain].<ref>Botting (1978) p.106</ref>}}\n\nBecause of Kidd's refusal to salute, the Navy vessel's captain retaliated by [[impressment|pressing]] much of Kidd's crew into [[Royal Navy|naval service]], despite rampant protests. Thus short-handed, Kidd sailed for New York City, capturing a French vessel en route (which was legal under the terms of his commission). To make up for the lack of officers, Kidd picked up replacement crew in New York, the vast majority of whom were known and hardened criminals, some undoubtedly former pirates.\n\nAmong Kidd's officers was his [[quartermaster]] [[Hendrick van der Heul]]. The quartermaster was considered \"second in command\" to the captain in pirate culture of this era. It is not clear, however, if van der Heul exercised this degree of responsibility, because Kidd was nominally a privateer. Van der Heul is also noteworthy because he may have been African or of African descent. A contemporary source describes him as a \"small black Man\". If van der Heul was indeed of African ancestry, this fact would make him the highest ranking black pirate so far identified. Van der Heul went on to become a [[master's mate]] on a merchant vessel, and was never convicted of piracy.\n\n===Hunting for pirates===\nIn September 1696, Kidd [[Weigh anchor|weighed anchor]] and set course for the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. A third of his crew died on the [[Comoros]] due to an outbreak of [[cholera]], the brand-new ship developed many leaks, and he failed to find the pirates whom he expected to encounter off [[Madagascar]].\n\nAs it became obvious that his ambitious enterprise was failing, Kidd became desperate to cover its costs. But, once again, he failed to attack several ships when given a chance, including a Dutchman and a New York privateer. Some of the crew deserted Kidd the next time that ''Adventure Galley'' anchored offshore, and those who decided to stay on made constant [[coercion|open threats]] of [[mutiny]].\n\n[[File:Pyle pirate relaxing2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd and his ship, ''Adventure Galley'', in [[New York Harbor]]]]\n[[File:Pyle pirates burying2.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Howard Pyle's fanciful painting of Kidd burying treasure]]\nKidd killed one of his own crewmen on 30 October 1697. Kidd's gunner William Moore was on deck sharpening a [[chisel]] when a Dutch ship appeared. Moore urged Kidd to attack the Dutchman, an act not only piratical but also certain to anger Dutch-born King William. Kidd refused, calling Moore a lousy dog. Moore retorted, \"If I am a lousy dog, you have made me so; you have brought me to ruin and many more.\" Kidd snatched up and heaved an ironbound bucket at Moore. Moore fell to the deck with a [[Skull fracture|fractured skull]] and died the following day.<ref>Cordingly (1995), p.183</ref>\n\nSeventeenth-century English [[admiralty law]] allowed captains great leeway in using violence against their crew, but outright murder was not permitted. Yet Kidd seemed unconcerned, later explaining to his surgeon that he had \"good friends in England, that will bring me off for that\".\n\n===Accusations of piracy===\nActs of savagery on Kidd's part were reported by escaped prisoners, who told stories of being hoisted up by the arms and ''drubbed'' with a drawn [[cutlass]]. On one occasion, crew members ransacked the trading ship ''Mary'' and tortured several of its crew members while Kidd and the other captain, Thomas Parker, conversed privately in Kidd's cabin. When Kidd found out what had happened, he was outraged and forced his men to return most of the stolen property.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nKidd was declared a pirate very early in his voyage by a Royal Navy officer, to whom he had promised \"thirty men or so\".<ref name=\"Hamilton, 1961 p\"/> Kidd sailed away during the night to preserve his crew, rather than subject them to Royal Navy [[impressment]].{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 30 January 1698, Kidd raised French colours and took his greatest prize, the 400-ton ''[[Quedagh Merchant]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Pirates of the High Seas \u2013 Capt.

The captain of ''Quedagh Merchant'' was an Englishman named Wright, who had purchased passes from the French East India Company promising him the protection of the French Crown. After realising the captain of the taken vessel was an Englishman, Kidd tried to persuade his crew to return the ship to its owners,{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} but they refused, claiming that their prey was perfectly legal, as Kidd was commissioned to take French ships, and that an Armenian ship counted as French, if it had French passes. In an attempt to maintain his tenuous control over his crew, Kidd relented and kept the prize. When this news reached England, it confirmed Kidd's reputation as a pirate, and various naval commanders were ordered to \"pursue and seize the said Kidd and his accomplices\" for the \"notorious piracies\" they had committed.<ref>Hamilton, (1961)</ref>\n\nKidd kept the French passes of ''Quedagh Merchant'', as well as the vessel itself. While the passes were at best a dubious defence of his capture, British admiralty and vice-admiralty courts (especially in North America) heretofore had often winked at privateers' excesses into piracy, and Kidd may have been hoping that the passes would provide the legal fig leaf that would allow him to keep ''Quedagh Merchant'' and her cargo. Renaming the seized merchantman ''Adventure Prize'', he set sail for Madagascar.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nOn 1 April 1698, Kidd reached Madagascar. After meeting privately with trader [[Tempest Rogers]] (who would later be accused of trading and selling Kidd's looted East India goods),<ref>{{cite book|last1=Office|first1=Great Britain Public Record|title=Calendar of State Papers: Colonial Series ...|date=1908|publisher=Longman|location=London|pages=486\u2013487|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LBQFAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=16 August 2017|language=en}}</ref> he found the first pirate of his voyage, [[Robert Culliford]] (the same man who had stolen Kidd\u2019s ship years before) and his crew aboard ''Mocha Frigate''. Two contradictory accounts exist of how Kidd reacted to his encounter with Culliford. According to ''The General History of the Pirates'', published more than 25 years after the event by an author whose identity remains in dispute, Kidd made peaceful overtures to Culliford: he \"drank their Captain's health\", swearing that \"he was in every respect their Brother\", and gave Culliford \"a Present of an Anchor and some Guns\".<ref>Charles Johnson (1728). ''The History of the Pyrates'', p. 75.</ref> This account appears to be based on the testimony of Kidd's crewmen Joseph Palmer and Robert Bradinham at his trial. The other version was presented by Richard Zacks in his 2002 book ''The Pirate Hunter: The True Story of Captain Kidd''. According to Zacks, Kidd was unaware that Culliford had only about 20 crew with him, and felt ill-manned and ill-equipped to take ''Mocha Frigate'' until his two prize ships and crews arrived, so he decided not to molest Culliford until these reinforcements came. After ''Adventure Prize'' and ''Rouparelle'' came in, Kidd ordered his crew to attack Culliford's ''Mocha Frigate''. However, his crew, despite their previous eagerness to seize any available prize, refused to attack Culliford and threatened instead to shoot Kidd. Zacks does not refer to any source for his version of events.<ref>Zacks, p. 185-86.</ref>\n\nBoth accounts agree that most of Kidd's men now abandoned him for Culliford. Only 13 remained with ''Adventure Galley''. Deciding to return home, Kidd left the ''[[Adventure Galley]]'' behind, ordering her to be burnt because she had become worm-eaten and leaky. Before burning the ship, he was able to salvage every last scrap of metal, such as hinges. With the loyal remnant of his crew, he returned to the Caribbean aboard the ''Adventure Prize''.{{fact|date=April 2018}} Some of his crew later returned to America on their own as passengers aboard [[Giles Shelley]]'s ship ''Nassau''.<ref name=\"Jameson - Privateering and Piracy\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=John Franklin|title=Privateering and Piracy in the Colonial Period by J.

There is speculation that he probably would have been spared had he talked. Finding Kidd politically useless, the Tory leaders sent him to stand trial before the [[Admiralty court|High Court of Admiralty]] in London, for the charges of piracy on high seas and the murder of William Moore. Whilst awaiting trial, Kidd was confined in the infamous [[Newgate Prison]], and wrote several letters to King William requesting clemency.{{fact|date=April 2018}}\n\nKidd had two lawyers to assist in his defence.<ref>Zacks, p. 364.</ref> He was shocked to learn at his trial that he was charged with murder. He was found guilty on all charges (murder and five counts of piracy) and sentenced to death. He was hanged in a public execution on 23 May 1701, at [[Execution Dock]], [[Wapping]], in London. He was hanged two times. On the first attempt, the hangman's rope broke and Kidd survived. Although some in the crowd called for Kidd's release, claiming the breaking of the rope was a sign from God, Kidd was hanged again minutes later, this time successfully.

Both proteins, calnexin and calreticulin, have the function of binding to [[oligosaccharide]]s containing terminal glucose residues, thereby targeting them for degradation.  In normal cellular function, trimming of glucose residues off the core oligosaccharide added during N-linked [[glycosylation]] is a part of protein processing.  If \"overseer\" enzymes note that residues are misfolded, proteins within the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum|rER]] will re-add glucose residues so that other calreticulin/calnexin can bind to these proteins and prevent them from proceeding to the Golgi.  This leads these aberrantly folded proteins down a path whereby they are targeted for degradation.\n\nStudies on transgenic mice reveal that calreticulin is a cardiac embryonic gene that is essential during development.<ref name=\"pmid12445456\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Michalak M, Lynch J, Groenendyk J, Guo L, Robert Parker JM, Opas M | title = Calreticulin in cardiac development and pathology | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1600 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 32\u20137 | date = Nov 2002 | pmid = 12445456 | doi = 10.1016/S1570-9639(02)00441-7 }}</ref>\n\nCalreticulin and calnexin are also integral proteins in the production of [[MHC class I]] Proteins. As newly synthesized MHC class I \u03b1-chains enter the endoplasmic reticulum, calnexin binds on to them retaining them in a partly folded state.<ref>{{cite book | author = Murphy K |title=Janeway's Immunobiology | date = 2011 | publisher = Taylor & Francis | location = Oxford | isbn = 978-0815342434 | edition = 8th}}</ref> After the \u03b22-microglobulin binds to the peptide-loading complex (PLC), calreticulin (along with [[ERp57]]) takes over the job of chaperoning the MHC class I protein while the [[tapasin]] links the complex to the [[transporter associated with antigen processing]] (TAP) complex. This association prepares the MHC class I for binding an antigen for presentation on the cell surface.\n\n=== Transcription regulation ===\n\nCalreticulin is also found in the nucleus, suggesting that it may have a role in transcription regulation. Calreticulin binds to the [[synthetic peptide]] KLGFFKR, which is almost identical to an amino acid sequence in the [[DNA-binding domain]] of the superfamily of [[nuclear receptor]]s. The [[N-terminus|amino terminus]] of calreticulin interacts with the DNA-binding domain of the [[glucocorticoid receptor]] and prevents the receptor from binding to its specific [[glucocorticoid response element]]. Calreticulin can inhibit the binding of [[androgen receptor]] to its hormone-responsive DNA element and can inhibit androgen receptor and [[retinoic acid receptor]] transcriptional activities in vivo, as well as retinoic acid-induced neuronal differentiation. Thus, calreticulin can act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors.\n\n== Clinical significance ==\n\nCalreticulin binds to [[antibody|antibodies]] in certain area of [[Lupus erythematosus|systemic lupus]] and [[Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome|Sjogren]] patients that contain [[Anti-SSA/Ro autoantibodies|anti-Ro/SSA antibodies]]. Systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with increased autoantibody titers against calreticulin, but calreticulin is not a Ro/SS-A antigen.

The reason why most of the cells are not destroyed is the presence of another molecule with signal [[CD47]], which blocks CRT.  Hence antibodies that block CD47 might be useful as a cancer treatment.

The choice of a small islet as a home may seem odd today, yet waterways were the main channels for both communication and travel until the 19th century in much of Ireland and especially Highland Scotland. Crannogs are traditionally interpreted as simple prehistorical farmsteads. They are also interpreted as boltholes in times of danger, as status symbols with limited access and as inherited locations of power that imply a sense of legitimacy and ancestry towards ownership of the surrounding landscape.\n\nA strict definition of a crannog, which has long been debated, requires the use of timber.<ref name=Lynn /> Sites in the Western Isles do not satisfy this criterion, although their inhabitants shared the common habit of living on water.<ref name=Lynn /><ref name=\"Harding 2000\" /> If not classed as \"true\" crannogs, small occupied islets (often at least partially artificial in nature) may be referred to as \"island duns\",<ref name=\"Armit 1996\" /> although rather confusingly, 22 islet-based sites are classified as \"proper\" crannogs due to the different interpretations of the inspectors or excavators who drew up field reports.<ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/results/?sitename=&site_type_term=CRANNOG+&site_discipline=1&numlink=&mapno=&site=&council_code=410&parish=&region_code=&district_code=&county_code=&ngr=&locat_xy_radius_m=&collection_name=&biblio_surname=&biblio_inits=&biblio_title=&biblio_date=&biblio_journal=&site_country=1&submit=Search Canmore search for crannog in the Western Isles]</ref> Hebridean island dwellings or crannogs were commonly built on both natural and artificial islets, usually reached by a stone causeway.

Thus the re-occupiers may have viewed crannogs as a legacy that remained alive in local tradition and memory. Crannog reoccupation is important and significant, especially in the many instances of crannogs built near natural islets that were often completely unused. This long chronology of use has been verified both by [[radiocarbon dating]] and more precisely by [[dendrochronology]].<ref name=\"Crone, B. A 2000\"/> Interpretations of crannog function are not static through time; instead they appear to change in both the archaeological and historic records. Rather than largely simple domestic residences in prehistory, the medieval crannogs were increasingly seen as strongholds of the upper class or regional political players such as Gaelic chieftains like the O'Boylans and McMahons in [[County Monaghan]] and the Kingdom of [[Airg\u00edalla]] until the 17th century. In Scotland, their medieval and post-medieval use is also documented into the early 18th century.<ref name=\"Dixon 2004\" /><ref name=Morrison /> Whether this increase in status is real, or just a by-product of increasingly complex material assemblages, remains to be convincingly validated.<ref name=Fredengren />\n\n==History==\nThe earliest known construction of a crannog is the completely artificial Neolithic islet of [[Eilean D\u00f2mhnuill]], Loch Olabhat on [[North Uist]] in Scotland. Eilean Domhnuill<ref name=\"Armit 1996\" /> has produced radiocarbon dates ranging from 3650 to 2500 BC<ref name=\"Armit 2003\" /> while Irish crannogs appear from middle [[Bronze Age]] layers at [[Ballinderry]] (1200\u2013600 BC).<ref>''National Handbook of Underwater Archaeology'', by Carol Rupp\u00e9, Jan Barstadch.</ref> Prior to the Bronze Age, the existence of artificial island settlement in Ireland is not as clear. While lakeside settlements are evident in Ireland from 4500 BC, these settlements are not crannogs as they were not intended to be islands. Despite having a tremendous chronology, their use was not at all consistent or unchanging. Crannog construction and occupation was at its peak in Scotland from about 800 BC to AD 200.<ref name=\"Henderson 1998\" /> Not surprisingly, crannogs have useful defensive properties, although there appears to be more significance to prehistoric use than simple defense, as very few weapons or evidence for destruction appear in excavations of prehistoric crannogs. In Ireland, crannogs were at their zenith during the Early Historic period,<ref name=\"O'Sullivan 2000\" /> when they were the homes and retreats of kings, lords, prosperous farmers and occasionally socially marginalised groups such as monastic hermits or metalsmiths who could work in isolation. However, despite earlier concepts of a strict Early Historic evolution,<ref name=Lynn /> Irish excavations are increasingly uncovering examples, which date from the \"missing\" Iron Age in Ireland.<ref name=\"O'Sullivan & Sands\" />\n\n==Construction==\n[[File:Loughbrickland Crannog.jpg|thumb|[[Loughbrickland Crann\u00f3g]] in [[Northern Ireland]].]]\nThe construction techniques for a crannog (prehistoric or otherwise) are as varied as the multitude of finished forms witnessed in the archaeological record. Island settlement in Scotland and Ireland is manifest through the entire range of possibilities ranging from entirely natural, small islets to completely artificial islets, therefore definitions will invariably remain contentious. For crannogs in the strict sense, typically this effort began on a shallow reef or rise in the lochbed.\n\nWhen timber was available, many were surrounded by a circle of wooden [[Deep foundation|piles]] with axe-sharpened bases that were driven into the bottom, forming a circular enclosure that helped to retain the main mound and prevent erosion. The piles could also be joined together by [[mortise and tenon]], or large holes cut to carefully accept specially shaped timbers designed to interlock and provide structural rigidity. On other examples, interior surfaces were built up with any mixture of clay, peat, stone, timber or brush \u2013 whatever was available. In some instances, more than one structure was built on crannogs.<ref name=\"Armit 2003\" />\n\nOther types of crannogs saw the occupants add large stones to the waterline of small natural islets, extending and enlarging them over successive phases of renewal. Larger crannogs could be occupied by extended families or communal groups, and access was either by logboats or coracles while evidence for timber or stone causeways exists on a large number of crannogs. The causeways themselves may have been slightly submerged; this has been interpreted as a device to make access difficult<ref name=\"Beveridge, E 1911\"/> but may also simply be a by-product of loch level fluctuations over the ensuing centuries or indeed millennia. Organic remains are often found in excellent condition on these water-logged sites. The bones of [[cattle]], [[deer]], and [[Pig|swine]] have been found in excavated crannogs while remains of wooden utensils and even dairy products can remain completely preserved for several millennia.<ref name=\"Dixon 2004\" />\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | last = Burnett | first = George\n | title = The Family of Burnett of Leys\n | editor = J.

The calendar date allows the specific day to be identified. The number of days between two dates may be calculated. For example, \"24 {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}\" is ten days after \"14 {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}\" in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. The date of a particular event depends on the observed [[time zone]]. For example, the air [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] that began at 7:48&nbsp;a.m. Hawaiian time on December 7, 1941, took place at 3:18&nbsp;a.m. December 8 in Japan ([[Japan Standard Time]]). \n\nA particular day may be represented by a different date in another calendar as in the [[Gregorian calendar]] and the [[Julian calendar]], which have been used simultaneously in different places. In most calendar systems, the date consists of three parts: the ''day of month'', ''month'', and the ''year''. There may also be additional parts, such as the ''day of week''. Years are usually counted from a particular starting point, usually called the [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]], with [[era]] referring to the particular period of time (Note [[geologic time scale|the different use]] of the terms in [[geology]]).\n\nThe most widely used epoch is a [[Convention (norm)|conventional]] [[Historical Jesus#Birth|birthdate of Jesus]] (which was established by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the sixth century). A date without the year part may also be referred to as a ''date'' or ''calendar date'' (such as \"{{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}}\" rather than \"{{CURRENTDAY}} {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}\"). As such, it defines the day of an annual event, such as a birthday or Christmas on 24/25 December.\n\nMany computer systems internally store points in time in [[Unix time]] format or some other [[system time]] format.\nThe [[date (Unix)]] command\u2014internally using the [[C date and time functions]]\u2014can be used to convert that internal representation of a point in time\nto most of the date representations shown here.\n\nThe current date in the Gregorian calendar is {{Date}}.  If this is not really the current date, then {{Purge|click here}} to update it.\n\n==Date format==\n{{See also|Date format by country}}\n\nThere is a large variety of formats for dates in use, which differ in the order of date components (e.g. 31/05/1999, 05/31/1999, 1999/05/31), component separators (e.g. 31.05.1999, 31/05/1999, 31-05-1999), whether leading zeros are included (e.g. 31/5/1999 vs. 31/05/1999), whether all four digits of the year are written (e.g., 31.05.1999 vs. 31.05.99), and whether the month is represented in [[Arabic numerals|Arabic]] or [[Roman numerals]] or by name  (e.g. 31.05.1999, 31.V.1999 vs. 31 May 1999).\n\n===Gregorian, day-month-year (DMY)===\n<!--[[DMY]], [[Dmy], [[DMY date]] and [[Dmy date]] redirect here-->\nThis [[little-endian]] sequence is common to the majority of the world's countries. This date format originates from the custom of writing the date as \"the 9th day of November in the year of our Lord 2014\" in Western religious and legal documents. The format has shortened over time but the order of the elements has remained constant.\n\n*\"9 November 2014\" or \"9.

It is associated with a number of schools and universities. It has also been used by the Vatican as an alternative to using months named after Roman deities. It is used on Canadian postmarks as a [[bilingual]] form of the month.\n*9 November 2014 [[Common Era|CE]] or 9 November [[Anno Domini|AD]] 2014\n\n===Gregorian, year-month-day (YMD)===\n<!--[[YMD]] and [[YMD date]] redirect here-->\nIn this format the most significant data item is written before lesser data items i.e. year before month before day.

That is, using this format textual orderings and chronological orderings are identical. This form is standard in East Asia, Iran, Lithuania, Hungary and Sweden; and some other countries to a limited extent.\n\nExamples for the 9th of November 2003:\n*2003-11-09: the standard Internet date/time format,<ref>[http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime W3C Date and Time Formats] Internet date/time format<!-- retrieved 23 September --></ref> a profile of the international standard [[ISO 8601]], orders the components of a date like this, and additionally uses leading zeros, for example, 1996-05-01, to be easily read and sorted by computers. It is used with [[UTC]] in RFC 3339. This format is also favoured in certain [[Asia]]n countries, mainly [[East Asian]] countries, as well as in some European countries.

In the United States, it is said as Sunday, November 9, although usage of \"the\" isn't uncommon (e.g. ''Sunday, November the 9th'', and even ''November the 9th, Sunday'', are also possible and readily understood).\n\n*Sunday, November 9, 2014\n*November 9, 2014\n*Nov. 9, 2014 or 11/9/2014\n*11-9-2014, 11.9.2014, 11.09.14, or 11/09/14\n\nThe modern convention is to avoid using the ordinal (th, st, rd, nd) form of numbers when the day follows the month (July 4 or July 4, 1776).  The ordinal was common in the past, and is still sometimes used (4th July or July 4th).\n\n===Gregorian, year-day-month (YDM)===\nThis date format is used in [[Latvia]], [[Nepal]] and [[Turkmenistan]].\n\n===Standards===\nThere are several standards that specify date formats:\n* [[ISO 8601]] ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'' specifies ''YYYY-MM-DD'' (the separators are optional, but only hyphens are allowed to be used), where all values are fixed length numeric, but also allows ''YYYY-DDD'', where ''DDD'' is the ordinal number of the day within the year, e.g. 2001-365.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=40874 ISO 8601:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'']</ref>\n* RFC 3339 ''Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps'' specifies ''YYYY-MM-DD'', i.e. a particular subset of the options allowed by ISO 8601.<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6 RFC 3339 ''Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps'', section 5.6 Internet Date/Time Format]</ref>\n* [[RFC 5322]] ''Internet Message Format'' specifies ''day month year'' where ''day'' is one or two digits, ''month'' is a three letter month abbreviation, and ''year'' is four digits.<ref>[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.3 RFC 5322 ''Internet Message Format'', section 3.3 Date and Time Specification]</ref>\n\n===Usage overloading===\nMany numerical forms can create confusion when used in international correspondence, particularly when abbreviating the year to its final two digits.\n\nFor example, \"7/8\" could refer to either 7 August or July 8. In the [[United States]], dates are rarely written in purely numerical forms in formal writing, although they are very common elsewhere; when numerical forms are used, the month appears first. In the United Kingdom, while it is regarded as acceptable albeit less common to write ''month-name day, year'', this order is never used when written numerically. However, as an exception, the American shorthand \"9/11\" is widely understood as referring to the [[September 11 attacks|11 September 2001 terrorist attacks]].<ref name=\"BBC-ADOT\">[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/americas/2001/day_of_terror/ BBC News \u2013 America's Day of Terror\"] (Example of British website using \"9/11\" shorthand)</ref>\n\nWhen numbers are used to represent months, a significant amount of confusion can arise from the ambiguity of a date order; especially when the numbers representing the day, month or year are low, it can be impossible to tell which order is being used. This can be clarified by using four digits to represent years, and naming the month; for example, \"Feb\" instead of \"02\". The ISO 8601 date order with four-digit years: YYYY-MM-DD (introduced in ISO 2014), is specifically chosen to be unambiguous. The ISO 8601 standard also has the advantage of being language independent and is therefore useful when there may be no language context and a universal application is desired (expiration dating on export products, for example). Many Internet sites use YYYY-MM-DD, and those using other conventions often use -MMM- for the month to further clarify and avoid ambiguity (2001-MAY-09, 9-MAY-2001, MAY 09 2001, etc.).\n\nIn addition, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] considers its ISO 8601 standard to make sense from a logical perspective.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/date_and_time_format | accessdate=2008-04-27 | title=Numeric representation of Dates and Time }}</ref> Mixed units, for example feet and inches, or pounds and ounces, are normally written with the largest unit first, in decreasing order. Numbers are also written in that order, so the digits of 2006 indicate, in order, the millennium, the century within the millennium, the decade within the century, and the year within the decade. The only date order that is consistent with these well-established conventions is year-month-day. A plain text list of dates with this format can be easily sorted by [[file manager]]s, [[word processor]]s, [[spreadsheet]]s and other software tools with built-in sorting functions. Some database systems use an eight-digit YYYYMMDD representation to handle date values. Naming folders with YYYY-MM-DD at the beginning allows them to be listed in date order when sorting by name - especially useful for organising document libraries.\n\nAn early U.S. [[Federal Information Processing Standard]] recommended 2-digit years. This is now widely recognized as a bad idea, because of the [[year 2000 problem]]. Some U.S. government agencies now use ISO 8601 with 4-digit years.<ref>[http://www.nyecounty.net/iso8601.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221020451/http://www.nyecounty.net/iso8601.html |date=February 21, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iprocessmart.com/techsmart/iso-time.htm |title=International Standard Date and Time Notation |publisher=Iprocessmart.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-26}}</ref>\n\nWhen transitioning from one date notation to another, people often write both styles; for example [[Old Style and New Style dates]] in the transition from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar.\n\n==Advantages for ordering in sequence==\nOne of the advantages of using the [[ISO 8601]] date format is that the [[lexicographical order]] ([[ASCIIbetical]]) of the representations is equivalent to the chronological order of the dates, assuming that all dates are in the same time zone. Thus dates can be sorted using simple string comparison algorithms, and indeed by any left to right [[collation]]. For example:\n\n 1998-02-28 (28 February 1998) sorts before\n 1999-03-01 (1 March 1999) which sorts before\n 2000-01-30 (30 January 2000)\n\nThe YYYY-MM-DD layout is the only common format that can provide this.<ref name=W3CFAQ>{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-date-format | accessdate=2008-10-21 | title=FAQ: Date formats | publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) }}</ref> Sorting other date representations involves some [[parsing]] of the date strings. This also works when a time in 24-hour format is included after the date, as long as all times are understood to be in the same time zone.\n\nISO 8601 is used widely where concise, human readable yet easily computable and unambiguous dates are required, although many applications store dates internally as [[UNIX time]] and only convert to ISO 8601 for display. It is worth noting that all modern computer [[Operating Systems]] retain date information of files outside of their titles, allowing the user to choose which format they prefer and have them sorted thus, irrespective of the files' names.\n\n==Specialized usage==\n\n===Day and year only===\n{{See also|calendar|time|date-time group|Japanese calendar|Wikibooks:English in Use/Time and Date}}\n\nThe U.S. military sometimes uses a system, which they call \"Julian date format\"<ref>Hynes, John (?). A summary of time formats and standards. Retrieved on 2011-02-09 from http://www.decimaltime.hynes.net/p/dates.html.</ref> that indicates the year and the actual day out of the 365 days of the year (and thus a designation of the month would not be needed). For example, \"11 December 1999\" can be written in some contexts as \"1999345\" or \"99345\", for the 345th day of 1999.<ref name=km-iso>Kuhn, Markus (2004-12-19). A summary of the international standard date and time notation. University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. Retrieved on 2006-08-01 from http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-time.html.</ref> This system is most often used in US military logistics, since it makes the process of calculating estimated shipping and arrival dates easier. For example: say a tank engine takes an estimated 35 days to ship by sea from the US to Korea. If the engine is sent on 99104, it should arrive on 99139. Note that outside of the US military and some US government agencies, including the [[Internal Revenue Service]], this format is usually referred to as \"[[ordinal date]]\", rather than \"Julian date\"<ref>Department of Defense. [http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/06-MAPAD_DEFINITIONS_TERMS_12-17-01.pdf \"Definition of Terms.\"] March 11, 1997. Retrieved October 24, 2011.</ref>\n\nSuch ordinal date formats are also used by many computer programs (especially those for mainframe systems). Using a three-digit [[Julian date|Julian day number]] saves one byte of computer storage over a two-digit month plus two-digit day, for example, \"January 17\" is 017 in Julian versus 0117 in month-day format. [[OS/390]] or its successor, [[z/OS]], display dates in yy.ddd format for most operations.\n\n[[UNIX time]], which stores time as a number in seconds since the UNIX Epoch (1970-01-01).\n\nAnother \"ordinal\" date system (\"ordinal\" in the sense of advancing in value by one as the date advances by one day) is in common use in astronomical calculations and referencing and uses the same name as this \"logistics\" system. The continuity of representation of period regardless of the time of year being considered is highly useful to both groups of specialists. The astronomers describe their system as also being a \"[[Julian date]]\" system. Unlike the system described above, the astronomical system does not consider years, it only counts days. Thus it is unperturbed by complications such as leap years.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}\n\n===Week number used===\nCompanies in Europe often use year, week number and day for planning purposes.\nSo, for example, an event in a project can happen on w43 (week 43) or w43-1 (Monday, week 43) or, if the year needs to be indicated, on w0543 or w543 (year 2005 week 43).\n\nThe ISO does present a standard for [[ISO week date|identifying weeks]], but as it does not match up with Gregorian calendar (the beginning and ending days of a given year do not match up), this standard is somewhat more problematic than the other standards for dates.\n\n===Expressing dates in spoken English===\nIn [[English language|English-language]]  outside North America (mostly in Anglophone Europe and some countries in Australasia), full dates are written as ''7 December 1941'' (or ''7th December 1941'') and spoken as \"the seventh of December, nineteen forty-one\" (exceedingly common usage of \"the\" and \"of\"), with the occasional usage of ''December 7, 1941'' (\"December the seventh, nineteen forty-one\"). In common with most continental European usage, however, all-numeric dates are invariably ordered dd/mm/yyyy.\n\nIn [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the usual written form is ''December 7, 1941'', spoken as \"December seventh, nineteen forty-one\" or colloquially \"December the seventh, nineteen forty-one\". [[Ordinal number (linguistics)|Ordinal]] numerals, however, are not always used when writing and pronouncing dates, and \"December seven, nineteen forty-one\" is also an accepted pronunciation of the date written ''December 7, 1941''. A notable exception to this rule is the [[Fourth of July]] (U.S. [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[:Category:Calendar algorithms|Calendar algorithms]]\n* [[Date and time representation by country]]\n* [[Date and time notation in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Date and time notation in the United States]]\n* [[Internationalization and localization]]\n* [[ISO 8601]] \u2013 an international standard covering the representation of dates and times\n* [[Time formatting and storage bugs]]\n* [[Year 10,000 problem]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[[IETF]]: RFC 3339\n*[http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/formats.htm The ISO 8601 Date Format]<!-- Retrieved 23 September 2006 -->\n*{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/locales/index.jsp |title=Globalization locale database |accessdate=2008-10-13 |publisher=IBM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426205632/http://www-01.ibm.com/software/globalization/locales/index.jsp |archivedate=April 26, 2009 }}\n*{{cite web| url=http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/nlsweb/default.mspx | title=NLS (National Language Support) information page | publisher=Microsoft | accessdate=2008-10-13 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080315070046/http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/nlsweb/default.mspx| archivedate = March 15, 2008}}\n* RFC 2550 : Y10K and Beyond\n*[http://www.curiousnotions.com/todays-date.asp Today's date (Gregorian) in over 400 more-or-less obscure foreign languages]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Calendar Date}}\n[[Category:Calendars]]", "sha1": "9gy8w0ty5g8vmr3genczbexmd0trtls"}}, {"title": "Cist", "ns": "0", "id": "7124", "revision": {"id": "854928031", "parentid": "841833718", "timestamp": "2018-08-14T19:14:26Z", "contributor": {"ip": "31.52.113.206"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses}}\n[[File:Drizzlecombe kist 4.JPG|thumb|[[Kistvaen]] on the southern edge of [[Dartmoor]] in [[Drizzlecombe]] (England) showing the capstone and the inner cist structure.]][[Image:Cista.jpg|thumb|Cist]]\n\nA '''cist''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u026a|s|t}} or {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u026a|s|t}}; also '''kist''' {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|k|\u026a|s|t}};<ref>{{cite book | author = Houghton Mifflin | authorlink = Houghton Mifflin | title = The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language | edition = 4th | publisher = Houghton Mifflin | year = 2000 | location = Boston and New York | pages = 339 | url = http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/epub/ahd4.shtml | isbn = 978-0-395-82517-4}}</ref><ref>[http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com Merriam-Webster Unabridged] (MWU).

The entries 7 are symmetric to the main diagonal. (Only for the identity element is this true in all groups.)]]\nIn [[abstract algebra]], the '''center''' of a [[group (mathematics)|group]], {{math|''G''}}, is the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of elements that [[commutative|commute]] with every element of {{math|''G''}}. It is denoted {{math|Z(''G'')}}, from German ''[[wikt:Zentrum|Zentrum]],'' meaning ''center''. In [[set-builder notation]],\n\n:{{math|Z(''G'') {{=}} {''z'' \u2208 ''G'' \u2223 \u2200''g'' \u2208 ''G'', ''zg'' {{=}} ''gz''} }}.\n\nThe center is a [[normal subgroup]], {{math|Z(''G'') \u22b2 ''G''}}.  As a subgroup, it is always [[characteristic subgroup|characteristic]], but is not necessarily [[fully characteristic subgroup|fully characteristic]].  The [[quotient group]], {{math|''G'' / Z(''G'')}}, is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[inner automorphism]] group, {{math|Inn(''G'')}}.\n\nA group {{math|''G''}} is abelian if and only if {{math|Z(''G'') {{=}} ''G''}}.  At the other extreme, a group is said to be '''centerless''' if {{math|Z(''G'')}} is [[trivial group|trivial]]; i.e., consists only of the [[identity element]].\n\nThe elements of the center are sometimes called '''central'''.\n\n==As a subgroup==\nThe center of ''G'' is always a [[subgroup (mathematics)|subgroup]] of {{math|''G''}}.  In particular:\n# {{math|Z(''G'')}} contains the [[identity element]] of {{math|''G''}}, {{math|''e''}}, because, for all {{math|''g'' \u2208 G}}, it commutes with {{math|''g''}}, {{math|''eg'' {{=}} ''g'' {{=}} ''ge''}}, by definition;\n# If {{math|''x''}} and {{math|''y''}} are in {{math|Z(''G'')}}, then so is {{math|''xy''}}, by associativity: {{math|(''xy'')''g'' {{=}} ''x''(''yg'') {{=}} ''x''(''gy'') {{=}} (''xg'')''y'' {{=}} (''gx'')''y'' {{=}} ''g''(''xy'')}} for each {{math|''g'' \u2208 ''G''}}; i.e., {{math|Z(''G'')}} is closed;\n# If {{math|''x''}} is in {{math|Z(''G'')}}, then so is {{math|''x''{{sup|\u22121}}}} as, for all {{math|''g''}} in {{math|''G''}}, {{math|''x{{sup|\u22121}}''}} commutes with {{math|''g''}}: {{math|(''gx'' {{=}} ''xg'') \u21d2 (''x''{{sup|\u22121}}''gxx''{{sup|\u22121}} {{=}} ''x''{{sup|\u22121}}''xgx''{{sup|\u22121}}) \u21d2 (''x''{{sup|\u22121}}''g'' {{=}} ''gx''{{sup|\u22121}})}}.\n\nFurthermore, the center of {{math|''G''}} is always a [[normal subgroup]] of {{math|''G''}}, as it is closed under [[conjugate closure|conjugation]], as all elements commute.\n\n==Conjugacy classes and centralizers==\nBy definition, the center is the set of elements for which the [[conjugacy class]] of each element is the element itself; i.e., {{math|Cl(''g'') {{=}} {''g''}}}.\n\nThe center is also the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of all the [[centralizer and normalizer|centralizers]] of each element of {{math|''G''}}. As centralizers are subgroups, this again shows that the center is a subgroup.\n\n==Conjugation==\nConsider the map, {{math|''f'': ''G'' \u2192 Aut(''G'')}}, from {{math|''G''}} to the [[automorphism group]] of {{math|''G''}} defined by {{math|''f''(''g'') {{=}} ''\u03d5''{{sub|''g''}}}}, where {{math|''\u03d5''{{sub|''g''}}}} is the automorphism of {{math|''G''}} defined by \n:{{math|''f''(''g'')(''h'') {{=}} ''\u03d5''{{sub|''g''}}(''h'') {{=}} ''ghg''{{sup|\u22121}}}}.\n\nThe function, {{math|''f''}} is a [[group homomorphism]], and its [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] is precisely the center of {{math|''G''}}, and its image is called the [[inner automorphism group]] of {{math|''G''}}, denoted {{math|Inn(''G'')}}. By the [[first isomorphism theorem]] we get,\n:{{math|''G''/Z(''G'') \u2243 Inn(''G'')}}.\n\nThe [[cokernel]] of this map is the group {{math|Out(''G'')}} of [[outer automorphism]]s, and these form the [[exact sequence]]\n:{{math|1 \u27f6 Z(''G'') \u27f6 ''G'' \u27f6 Aut(''G'') \u27f6 Out(''G'') \u27f6 1}}.\n\n==Examples==\n{{unordered list\n| The center of an [[abelian group]], {{math|''G''}}, is all of {{math|''G''}}.\n| The center of the [[Heisenberg group]], {{math|''G''}}, are all matrices of the form:\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\n   1 & 0 & z\\\\\n   0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n   0 & 0 & 1\n \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n| The center of a [[nonabelian group|nonabelian]] [[simple group]] is trivial.\n| The center of the [[dihedral group]], {{math|D{{sub|''n''}}}}, is trivial when {{math|''n''}} is odd.

The republic's existence was declared through \"An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth\",<ref>[[Wikisource:An Act declaring England to be a Commonwealth]]</ref> adopted by the [[Rump Parliament]] on 19 May 1649.  Power in the early Commonwealth was vested primarily in the Parliament and a [[English Council of State|Council of State]]. During the period, fighting continued, particularly in [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Ireland]] and Scotland, between the parliamentary forces and those opposed to them, as part of what is now referred to as the [[Third English Civil War]].\n\nIn 1653, after the forcible dissolution of the Rump Parliament, the [[Army Council (1647)|Army Council]] adopted the [[Instrument of Government]] which made [[Oliver Cromwell]] [[Lord Protector]] of a united \"Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland\", inaugurating the period now usually known as [[the Protectorate]]. After Cromwell's death, and following a brief period of rule under his son, [[Richard Cromwell]], the [[Third Protectorate Parliament|Protectorate Parliament]] was dissolved in 1659 and the Rump Parliament recalled, the start of a process that led to the [[Restoration (England)|restoration of the monarchy]] in 1660. The term Commonwealth is sometimes used for the whole of 1649 to 1660 \u2013 a period referred to by monarchists as the [[Interregnum (1649\u20131660)|Interregnum]] \u2013 although for other historians, the use of the term is limited to the years prior to Cromwell's formal assumption of power in 1653.\n\n== 1649\u20131653 ==\n{{Infobox former country\n| conventional_long_name = Commonwealth of England\n| common_name            = Commonwealth of England\n| continent              = Europe\n| region                 = British Isles\n| government_type        = [[Commonwealth]]\n| image_map = Commonwealth of England (1649 to 1653).png\n| image_map_caption = Territory claimed by the Commonwealth in 1653\n| image_coat   = Arms of the Commonwealth of England.svg\n| coa_size     = x100px\n| symbol_type  = Arms\n| year_start   = 1649\n| year_end     = 1653\n| date_start   = 19 May\n| event_start  = Declaration\n| date_end     = 16 December\n| event_end    = [[Instrument of Government]]\n| p1           = Kingdom&nbsp;of England\n| image_p1     = [[File:Royal Arms of England (1603-1707).svg|20px|link=]]\n| p2      = Kingdom of Ireland\n| image_p2 = [[File:Arms of Ireland (Historical).svg|20px|link=Kingdom of Ireland]]\n| s1           = The Protectorate{{!}}Protectorate (Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland)\n| image_s1     = [[File:Arms of the Commonwealth of England.svg|20px|link=]]\n| capital      = [[London]]\n| title_leader = \n| leader1      = \n| year_leader1 = \n| legislature  = [[Rump Parliament|Parliament]]\n| house1       = \n| house2       = \n| stat_year1   = \n| stat_area1   = \n| stat_pop1    = \n| today        = \n| footnotes    = \n| width        = 265px\n| symbol_type_article=  Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom#Union of the Crowns and the Commonwealth\n\n}}\n\n=== Rump Parliament ===\n{{Main|Rump Parliament}}\n\nThe Rump was created by [[Pride's Purge]] of those members of the [[Long Parliament]] who did not support the political position of the [[Grandee#Grandee (New Model Army)|Grandee]]s in the [[New Model Army]]. Just before and after the execution of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] on 30 January 1649, the Rump passed a number of acts of Parliament creating the legal basis for the republic. With the abolition of the monarchy, [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] and the [[House of Lords]], it had unchecked executive and legislative power. The [[English Council of State]], which replaced the Privy Council, took over many of the executive functions of the monarchy. It was selected by the Rump, and most of its members were MPs. However, the Rump depended on the support of the Army with which it had a very uneasy relationship. After the execution of Charles I, the House of Commons abolished the monarchy and the House of Lords. It declared the people of England \"and of all the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging\" to be henceforth under the governance of a \"Commonwealth\",{{sfn|HMSO|1911}} effectively a republic.\n\n==== Structure ====\nIn [[Pride's Purge]], all members of parliament (including most of the political [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]]) who would not accept the need to bring the King to trial had been removed. Thus the Rump never had more than two hundred members (less than half the number of the Commons in the original Long Parliament). They included: supporters of religious independents who did not want an established church and some of whom had sympathies with the [[Levellers]]; Presbyterians who were willing to countenance the trial and execution of the King; and later admissions, such as formerly excluded MPs who were prepared to denounce the Newport Treaty negotiations with the King.\n\nMost Rumpers were [[gentry]], though there was a higher proportion of lesser gentry and lawyers than in previous parliaments.  Less than one-quarter of them were [[regicide]]s. This left the Rump as basically a conservative body whose vested interests in the existing land ownership and legal systems made it unlikely to want to reform them.\n\n==== Issues and achievements ====\n[[File:An Act Declaring and Constituting the People of England to be a Commonwealth and Free-State (1649).pdf|thumb|left|A 21st-century edition of the Act Declaring and Constituting the People of England to be a Commonwealth and Free-State enacted on 19 May 1649]]\n\nFor the first two years of the Commonwealth, the Rump faced economic depression and the risk of invasion from [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]]. By 1653 Cromwell and the Army had largely eliminated these threats.\n\nThere were many disagreements amongst factions of the Rump. Some wanted a republic, but others favoured retaining some type of monarchical government. Most of England's traditional ruling classes regarded the Rump as an illegal government made up of regicides and upstarts. However, they were also aware that the Rump might be all that stood in the way of an outright [[martial law|military dictatorship]]. High taxes, mainly to pay the Army, were resented by the gentry. Limited reforms were enough to antagonise the ruling class but not enough to satisfy the radicals.\n\nDespite its unpopularity, the Rump was a link with the old constitution, and helped to settle England down and make it secure after the biggest upheaval in its history. By 1653, [[France]] and [[Spain]] had recognised England's new government.\n\n==== Reforms ====\nThough the [[Church of England]] was retained, episcopacy was suppressed and the [[Act of Uniformity 1558]] was repealed in September 1650.<ref>27 September 1650 \"Act for the Repeal of several Clauses in Statutes imposing Penalties for not coming to Church\" {{harv|Firth|Rait|1911|pp=423\u2013425}}</ref>  Mainly on the insistence of the Army, many independent churches were tolerated, although everyone still had to pay [[tithe]]s to the established church.\n\nSome small improvements were made to law and court procedure; for example, all court proceedings were now conducted in English rather than in [[Law French]] or [[Latin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56426|title=November 1650: An Act for turning the Books of the Law, and all Proces and Proceedings in Courts of Justice, into English.|publisher=}}</ref> However, there were no widespread reforms of the [[common law]]. This would have upset the gentry, who regarded the common law as reinforcing their status and property rights.\n\nThe Rump passed many restrictive laws to regulate people's moral behaviour, such as [[London theatre closure 1642|closing down theatres]] and requiring [[Blue law|strict observance of Sunday]]. This antagonised most of the gentry.\n\n==== Dismissal ====\nCromwell, aided by [[Thomas Harrison (soldier)|Thomas Harrison]], forcibly dismissed the Rump on 20 April 1653, for reasons that are unclear. Theories are that he feared the Rump was trying to perpetuate itself as the government, or that the Rump was preparing for an election which could return an anti-Commonwealth majority. Many former members of the Rump continued to regard themselves as England's only legitimate constitutional authority. The Rump had not agreed to its own dissolution; their legal, constitutional view it was unlawful was based on Charles' concessionary Act prohibiting the dissolution of Parliament without its own consent (on 11 May 1641, leading to the entire Commonwealth being the latter years of the [[Long Parliament]] in their majority view).\n\n=== Barebone's Parliament, July\u2013December 1653 ===\n[[File:Commonwealth Unite 1653 692157.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|A gold [[Unite (English coin)|Unite]] from 1653]]\n\nThe dissolution of the Rump was followed by a short period in which Cromwell and the Army ruled alone. Nobody had the constitutional authority to call an election, but Cromwell did not want to impose a military dictatorship. Instead, he ruled through a 'nominated assembly' which he believed would be easy for the Army to control since Army officers did the nominating.\n\n[[Barebone's Parliament]] was opposed by former Rumpers and ridiculed by many gentries as being an assembly of 'inferior' people. However, over 110 of its 140 members were lesser [[landed gentry|gentry]] or of higher social status. (An exception was [[Praise-God Barebone]], a Baptist merchant after whom the Assembly got its derogatory nickname.) Many were well educated.\n\nThe assembly reflected the range of views of the officers who nominated it. The Radicals (approximately forty) included a hard core of [[Fifth Monarchists]] who wanted to be rid of Common Law and any state control of religion. The Moderates (approximately 60) wanted some improvements within the existing system and might move to either the radical or conservative side depending on the issue. The Conservatives (approximately 40) wanted to keep the status quo (since Common Law protected the interests of the gentry, and tithes and [[advowson]]s were valuable property).\n\nCromwell saw Barebone's Parliament as a temporary legislative body which he hoped would produce reforms and develop a constitution for the Commonwealth. However, members were divided over key issues, only 25 had previous parliamentary experience, and although many had some legal training, there were no qualified lawyers.\n\nCromwell seems to have expected this group of 'amateurs' to produce reform without management or direction. When the radicals mustered enough support to defeat a bill which would have preserved the status quo in religion, the conservatives, together with many moderates, surrendered their authority back to Cromwell who sent soldiers to clear the rest of the Assembly.  Barebone's Parliament was over.\n\n==The Protectorate, 1653\u20131659==\n{{main|The Protectorate}}\n{{See also|First Protectorate Parliament|Second Protectorate Parliament|Third Protectorate Parliament}}\n[[File:Arms of the Protectorate (1653\u20131659).svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Arms of Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector, used on the great seal from 1655 to 1659.<ref>{{cite web|author=Culture 24|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/art367176|title=Parliament Week: A Cromwellian Act and Seal from the Cromwell Museum|publisher=Culture24.org.uk|accessdate=10 January 2015}}</ref>]]\n\nCommonwealth government under the Barebones was officially by a Council of State and Parliament.\n\nIn 1653, Oliver Cromwell became Lord Protector under England's first written constitution the [[Instrument of Government]], and then under the second and last written full constitutions, known as the [[Humble Petition and Advice]] of 1657. This meant executive power solely vested in the [[Lord Protector (Cromwell)|Lord Protector]] under a written and rewritten constitution that mandated that he summon triennial parliaments that should sit for several months each year.\n\nOn 12 April 1654, under the terms of the [[Tender of Union]], the ''Ordinance for uniting Scotland into one Commonwealth with England'' was issued by the Lord Protector and proclaimed in Scotland by the military governor of Scotland, General [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle]]. The ordinance declared that \"the people of Scotland should be united with the people of England into one Commonwealth and under one Government\" and decreed that a new \"[[Coat of arms of the Commonwealth of England|Arms of the Commonwealth]]\", incorporating the [[Saltire]], should be placed on \"all the public seals, seals of office, and seals of bodies civil or corporate, in Scotland\" as \"a badge of this Union\".{{sfn|Sevaldsen|2007|p=39}}{{sfn|Schultz|2010}}\n\nOn the death of Oliver Cromwell in 1658, his son, [[Richard Cromwell]], inherited the title, Lord Protector. Internal divisions among the Republican faction and quiet lobbying by moderates led to his resignation, the end of the Protectorate and a second brief spell of Commonwealth government by a Council of State and Parliament.\n\n== 1659\u20131660 ==<!-- This section is linked from [[The Protectorate]] -->\n{{Infobox former country\n| conventional_long_name = Commonwealth of England\n| common_name            = Commonwealth of England\n| continent              = Europe\n| region                 = British Isles\n| government_type        = [[Commonwealth]]\n| image_coat        = Arms of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland.svg\n| coa_size = x100px\n| symbol_type       = Arms\n| image_map = UK of Britain & Ireland in Europe.png\n| image_map_caption = Territory of the Commonwealth in 1660\n| year_start  = 1659\n| year_end    = 1660\n| date_start  = 25 May\n| event_start = [[Richard Cromwell|R.

Richard Cromwell's main weakness was that he did not have the confidence of the [[New Model Army]].\n\nAfter seven months the Grandees in the New Model Army removed him and, on 6 May 1659, they reinstalled the [[Rump Parliament]]. [[Charles Fleetwood]] was appointed a member of the [[English Committee of Safety|Committee of Safety]] and of the Council of State, and one of the seven commissioners for the army. On 9 June he was nominated lord-general (commander-in-chief) of the army. However, his power was undermined in parliament, which chose to disregard the army's authority in a similar fashion to the pre\u2013Civil War parliament. On 12 October 1659 the Commons cashiered [[John Lambert (general)|General John Lambert]] and other officers, and installed Fleetwood as chief of a military council under the authority of the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]]. The next day Lambert ordered that the doors of the House be shut and the members kept out. On 26 October a \"Committee of Safety\" was appointed, of which Fleetwood and Lambert were members. Lambert was appointed major-general of all the forces in England and Scotland, Fleetwood being general. Lambert was now sent, by the Committee of Safety, with a large force to meet [[George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle|George Monck]], who was in command of the English forces in Scotland, and either negotiate with him or force him to come to terms.\n\nIt was into this atmosphere that General George Monck marched south with his army from [[Scotland]]. Lambert's army began to desert him, and he returned to London almost alone. On 21 February 1660, Monck reinstated the Presbyterian members of the Long Parliament 'secluded' by Pride, so that they could prepare legislation for a new parliament. Fleetwood was deprived of his command and ordered to appear before parliament to answer for his conduct. On 3 March Lambert was sent to the Tower, from which he escaped a month later. Lambert tried to rekindle the civil war in favour of the Commonwealth by issuing a proclamation calling on all supporters of the \"[[Good Old Cause]]\" to rally on the battlefield of Edgehill. But he was recaptured by Colonel [[Richard Ingoldsby]], a [[regicide]] who hoped to win a pardon by handing Lambert over to the new regime. The Long Parliament dissolved itself on 16 March.\n\nOn 4 April 1660, in response to a secret message sent by Monck, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] issued the [[Declaration of Breda]], which made known the conditions of his acceptance of the crown of England. Monck organised the [[Convention Parliament (1660)|Convention Parliament]], which met for the first time on 25 April. On 8 May it proclaimed that King Charles II had been the lawful monarch since the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in January 1649.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.asp?compid=26183#s2|title=House of Commons Journal Volume 8: 8 May 1660|publisher=}}</ref> Charles returned from exile on 23 May.<ref name=\"pepysdiary23\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pepysdiary.com/archive/1661/04/23/index.php|title=Tuesday 23 April 1661|work=The Diary of Samuel Pepys}}</ref> He entered [[London]] on 29 May, his birthday.

This allows several users to share a band of frequencies (see [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]]). To permit this without undue interference between the users, CDMA employs [[spread spectrum]] technology and a special coding scheme (where each transmitter is assigned a code).<ref name=Zander/>\n\nCDMA is used as the access method in many [[mobile phone standards]]. [[cdmaOne|IS-95]], also called \"cdmaOne\", and its [[3G]] evolution [[CDMA2000]], are often simply referred to as \"CDMA\", but [[UMTS]], the 3G standard used by [[GSM]] carriers, also uses \"wideband CDMA\", or W-CDMA, as well as TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA, as its radio technologies.\n\n==History==\nThe technology of code-division multiple access channels has long been known. In the [[Soviet Union]] (USSR), the first work devoted to this subject was published in 1935 by [[Dmitry Vasiliyevich Ageev|Dmitry Ageev]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ageev|first=D.

The technology of CDMA was used in 1957, when the young military radio engineer [[Leonid Kupriyanovich]] in Moscow made an experimental model of a wearable automatic mobile phone, called LK-1 by him, with a base station.

The phone system weighed {{convert|11|kg|abbr=on}}.  It was placed in the trunk of the vehicles of high-ranking officials and used a standard handset in the passenger compartment. The main developers of the Altai system were VNIIS (Voronezh Science Research Institute of Communications) and GSPI (State Specialized Project Institute). In 1963 this service started in Moscow, and in 1970 Altai service was used in 30 USSR cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://englishrussia.com/2006/09/18/first-russian-mobile-phone/|title=First Russian Mobile Phone|date=September 18, 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Uses ==\n[[File:Au CDMA 1X WIN W31SAII gravelly silver expansion.jpg|thumb|A CDMA2000 [[mobile phone]]]]\n* One of the early applications for code-division multiplexing is in the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS).

A spread-spectrum technique spreads the bandwidth of the data uniformly for the same transmitted power.  A spreading code is a pseudo-random code that has a narrow [[ambiguity function]], unlike other narrow pulse codes. In CDMA a locally generated code runs at a much higher rate than the data to be transmitted.  Data for transmission is combined by bitwise [[XOR#Bitwise operation|XOR]] (exclusive OR) with the faster code.  The figure shows how a spread-spectrum signal is generated. The data signal with pulse duration of <math>T_b</math> (symbol period) is XORed with the code signal with pulse duration of <math>T_c</math> (chip period). (Note: [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] is proportional to <math>1/T</math>, where <math>T</math> = bit time.) Therefore, the bandwidth of the data signal is <math>1/T_b</math> and the bandwidth of the spread spectrum signal is <math>1/T_c</math>.  Since <math>T_c</math> is much smaller than <math>T_b</math>, the bandwidth of the spread-spectrum signal is much larger than the bandwidth of the original signal. The ratio <math>T_b/T_c</math> is called the spreading factor or processing gain and determines to a certain extent the upper limit of the total number of users supported simultaneously by a base station.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = Vern A.\n | last = Dubendorf\n | year = 2003\n | title = Wireless Data Technologies\n | edition =\n | publisher = John Wiley & Sons, Ltd\n | isbn =\n}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Generation of CDMA.svg|thumb|500px|center|Generation of a CDMA signal]]\n\nEach user in a CDMA system uses a different code to modulate their signal. Choosing the codes used to modulate the signal is very important in the performance of CDMA systems.<ref name=Zander/>  The best performance occurs when there is good separation between the signal of a desired user and the signals of other users. The separation of the signals is made by [[Cross-correlation|correlating]] the received signal with the locally generated code of the desired user. If the signal matches the desired user's code, then the correlation function will be high and the system can extract that signal.  If the desired user's code has nothing in common with the signal, the correlation should be as close to zero as possible (thus eliminating the signal); this is referred to as [[cross-correlation]]. If the code is correlated with the signal at any time offset other than zero, the correlation should be as close to zero as possible.  This is referred to as auto-correlation and is used to reject multi-path interference.<ref>{{cite web\n | last=\n | first =\n | title=CDMA Spectrum\n | publisher=\n | year=\n | work=\n | url= http://www.activexperts.com/asmssrvr/cellular/cdmaspectrum/\n | accessdate=2008-04-29\n}}</ref>\n\nAn analogy to the problem of multiple access is a room (channel) in which people wish to talk to each other simultaneously.  To avoid confusion, people could take turns speaking (time division), speak at different pitches (frequency division), or speak in different languages (code division). CDMA is analogous to the last example where people speaking the same language can understand each other, but other languages are perceived as [[noise]] and rejected.  Similarly, in radio CDMA, each group of users is given a shared code.  Many codes occupy the same channel, but only users associated with a particular code can communicate.\n\nIn general, CDMA belongs to two basic categories: synchronous (orthogonal codes) and asynchronous (pseudorandom codes).\n\n==Code-division multiplexing (synchronous CDMA)==\nThe digital modulation method is analogous to those used in simple radio transceivers. In the analog case, a low-frequency data signal is time-multiplied with a high-frequency pure sine-wave carrier and transmitted. This is effectively a frequency convolution ([[Wiener\u2013Khinchin theorem]]) of the two signals, resulting in a carrier with narrow sidebands. In the digital case, the sinusoidal carrier is replaced by [[Walsh function]]s. These are binary square waves that form a complete orthonormal set. The data signal is also binary and the time multiplication is achieved with a simple XOR function. This is usually a [[Gilbert cell]] mixer in the circuitry.\n\nSynchronous CDMA exploits mathematical properties of [[orthogonality]] between [[coordinate vector|vectors]] representing the data strings. For example, binary string ''1011'' is represented by the vector (1, 0, 1, 1). Vectors can be multiplied by taking their [[dot product]], by summing the products of their respective components (for example, if '''u''' = (''a'', ''b'') and '''v''' = (''c'', ''d''), then their dot product '''u'''\u00b7'''v''' = ''ac'' + ''bd'').  If the dot product is zero, the two vectors are said to be ''orthogonal'' to each other. Some properties of the dot product aid understanding of how [[W-CDMA]] works. If vectors '''a''' and '''b''' are orthogonal, then <math>\\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = 0</math> and:\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{a}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2,\\ \\text{since}\\ \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = \\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 + 0, \n</math>\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{a}\\cdot(-\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) = -\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2,\\ \\text{since}\\ {-\\mathbf{a}}\\cdot\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{a}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = -\\|\\mathbf{a}\\|^2 + 0,\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{b}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}) = \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|^2,\\ \\text{since}\\ \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a} + \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = 0 + \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|^2,\n</math>\n:<math>\n\\mathbf{b}\\cdot(\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}) = -\\|\\mathbf{b}\\|^2,\\ \\text{since}\\ \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{b}\\cdot\\mathbf{b} = 0 - \\|\\mathbf{b}\\|^2.\n</math>\n\nEach user in synchronous CDMA uses a code orthogonal to the others' codes to modulate their signal.  An example of 4 mutually orthogonal digital signals is shown in the figure below.  Orthogonal codes have a cross-correlation equal to zero; in other words, they do not interfere with each other.  In the case of IS-95, 64-bit [[Walsh code]]s are used to encode the signal to separate different users.  Since each of the 64 Walsh codes is orthogonal to all other, the signals are channelized into 64 orthogonal signals.  The following example demonstrates how each user's signal can be encoded and decoded.\n\n===Example===\n[[Image:Cdma orthogonal signals.png|thumb|right|An example of 4 mutually orthogonal digital signals]]\n\nStart with a set of vectors that are mutually [[orthogonality|orthogonal]]. (Although mutual orthogonality is the only condition, these vectors are usually constructed for ease of decoding, for example columns or rows from [[Walsh matrix|Walsh matrices]].) An example of orthogonal functions is shown in the adjacent picture.  These vectors will be assigned to individual users and are called the ''code'', ''[[chip (CDMA)|chip]] code'', or ''chipping code''.  In the interest of brevity, the rest of this example uses codes '''v''' with only two bits.\n\nEach user is associated with a different code, say '''v'''. A 1 bit is represented by transmitting a positive code '''v''', and a 0 bit is represented by a negative code '''\u2212v'''.  For example, if '''v''' = (''v''<sub>0</sub>, ''v''<sub>1</sub>) = (1, \u22121) and the data that the user wishes to transmit is (1, 0, 1, 1), then the transmitted symbols would be\n:('''v''', '''\u2212v''', '''v''', '''v''') = (''v''<sub>0</sub>, ''v''<sub>1</sub>, \u2212''v''<sub>0</sub>, \u2212''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>0</sub>, ''v''<sub>1</sub>, ''v''<sub>0</sub>, ''v''<sub>1</sub>) = (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121).\nFor the purposes of this article, we call this constructed vector the ''transmitted vector''.\n\nEach sender has a different, unique vector '''v''' chosen from that set, but the construction method of the transmitted vector is identical.\n\nNow, due to physical properties of interference, if two signals at a point are in phase, they add to give twice the amplitude of each signal, but if they are out of phase, they subtract and give a signal that is the difference of the amplitudes. Digitally, this behaviour can be modelled by the addition of the transmission vectors, component by component.\n\nIf sender0 has code (1, \u22121) and data (1, 0, 1, 1), and sender1 has code (1, 1) and data (0, 0, 1, 1), and both senders transmit simultaneously, then this table describes the coding steps:\n\n{| style=\"border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; background-color: #f7f8ff; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n| align=center bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" | Step\n| align=center bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" | Encode sender0\n| align=center bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" | Encode sender1\n|-\n| valign=top | 0\n| code0 = (1, \u22121), data0 = (1, 0, 1, 1)\n| code1 = (1, 1), data1 = (0, 0, 1, 1)\n|-\n| valign=top | 1\n| encode0 = 2(1, 0, 1, 1) \u2212 (1, 1, 1, 1) = (1, \u22121, 1, 1)\n| encode1 = 2(0, 0, 1, 1) \u2212 (1, 1, 1, 1) = (\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1)\n|-\n| valign=top | 2\n| signal0 = encode0 \u2297 code0<br />= (1, \u22121, 1, 1) \u2297 (1, \u22121)<br />= (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121)\n| signal1 = encode1 \u2297 code1<br />= (\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1) \u2297 (1, 1)<br />= (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, 1, 1)\n|}\n\nBecause signal0 and signal1 are transmitted at the same time into the air, they add to produce the raw signal\n\n:(1, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121) + (\u22121, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, 1, 1) = (0, \u22122, \u22122, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0).\n\nThis raw signal is called an interference pattern.  The receiver then extracts an intelligible signal for any known sender by combining the sender's code with the interference pattern. The following table explains how this works and shows that the signals do not interfere with one another:\n\n{|style=\"border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; background-color: #f7f8ff; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Step\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Decode sender0\n|align=center bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\"|Decode sender1\n|-\n|0\n|code0 = (1, \u22121), signal = (0, \u22122, \u22122, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0)\n|code1 = (1, 1), signal = (0, \u22122, \u22122, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0)\n|-\n|1\n|decode0 = pattern.vector0\n|decode1 = pattern.vector1\n|-\n|2\n|decode0 = ((0, \u22122), (\u22122, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0))\u2009\u00b7\u2009(1, \u22121)\n|decode1 = ((0, \u22122), (\u22122, 0), (2, 0), (2, 0))\u2009\u00b7\u2009(1, 1)\n|-\n|3\n|decode0 = ((0 + 2), (\u22122 + 0), (2 + 0), (2 + 0))\n|decode1 = ((0 \u2212 2), (\u22122 + 0), (2 + 0), (2 + 0))\n|-\n|4\n|data0=(2, \u22122, 2, 2), meaning (1, 0, 1, 1)\n|data1=(\u22122, \u22122, 2, 2), meaning (0, 0, 1, 1)\n|}\n\nFurther, after decoding, all values greater than 0 are interpreted as 1, while all values less than zero are interpreted as 0. For example, after decoding, data0 is (2, \u22122, 2, 2), but the receiver interprets this as (1, 0, 1, 1). Values of exactly 0 means that the sender did not transmit any data, as in the following example:\n\nAssume signal0 = (1, \u22121, \u22121, 1, 1, \u22121, 1, \u22121) is transmitted alone.

Since it is not mathematically possible to create signature sequences that are both orthogonal for arbitrarily random starting points and which make full use of the code space, unique \"pseudo-random\" or \"pseudo-noise\" (PN) sequences are used in ''asynchronous'' CDMA systems. A PN code is a binary sequence that appears random but can be reproduced in a deterministic manner by intended receivers. These PN codes are used to encode and decode a user's signal in asynchronous CDMA in the same manner as the orthogonal codes in synchronous CDMA (shown in the example above). These PN sequences are statistically uncorrelated, and the sum of a large number of PN sequences results in ''multiple access interference'' (MAI) that is approximated by a Gaussian noise process (following the [[central limit theorem]] in statistics).  [[Gold code]]s are an example of a PN suitable for this purpose, as there is low correlation between the codes. If all of the users are received with the same power level, then the variance (e.g., the noise power) of the MAI increases in direct proportion to the number of users. In other words, unlike synchronous CDMA, the signals of other users will appear as noise to the signal of interest and interfere slightly with the desired signal in proportion to number of users.\n\nAll forms of CDMA use [[spread-spectrum]] [[process gain]] to allow receivers to partially discriminate against unwanted signals. Signals encoded with the specified PN sequence (code) are received, while signals with different codes (or the same code but a different timing offset) appear as wideband noise reduced by the process gain.\n\nSince each user generates MAI, controlling the signal strength is an important issue with CDMA transmitters. A CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, or FDMA receiver can in theory completely reject arbitrarily strong signals using different codes, time slots or frequency channels due to the orthogonality of these systems. This is not true for asynchronous CDMA; rejection of unwanted signals is only partial. If any or all of the unwanted signals are much stronger than the desired signal, they will overwhelm it. This leads to a general requirement in any asynchronous CDMA system to approximately match the various signal power levels as seen at the receiver. In CDMA cellular, the base station uses a fast closed-loop power-control scheme to tightly control each mobile's transmit power.\n\n===Advantages of asynchronous CDMA over other techniques===\n\n====Efficient practical utilization of the fixed frequency spectrum====\nIn theory CDMA, TDMA and FDMA have exactly the same spectral efficiency, but, in practice, each has its own challenges \u2013 power control in the case of CDMA, timing in the case of TDMA, and frequency generation/filtering in the case of FDMA.\n\nTDMA systems must carefully synchronize the transmission times of all the users to ensure that they are received in the correct time slot and do not cause interference.  Since this cannot be perfectly controlled in a mobile environment, each time slot must have a guard time, which reduces the probability that users will interfere, but decreases the spectral efficiency.\n\nSimilarly, FDMA systems must use a guard band between adjacent channels, due to the unpredictable [[Doppler shift]] of the signal spectrum because of user mobility. The guard bands will reduce the probability that adjacent channels will interfere, but decrease the utilization of the spectrum.\n\n====Flexible allocation of resources====\nAsynchronous CDMA offers a key advantage in the flexible allocation of resources i.e. allocation of PN codes to active users.  In the case of CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA the number of simultaneous orthogonal codes, time slots, and frequency slots respectively are fixed, hence the capacity in terms of the number of simultaneous users is limited. There are a fixed number of orthogonal codes, time slots or frequency bands that can be allocated for CDM, TDMA, and FDMA systems, which remain underutilized due to the bursty nature of telephony and packetized data transmissions.  There is no strict limit to the number of users that can be supported in an asynchronous CDMA system, only a practical limit governed by the desired bit error probability since the SIR (signal-to-interference ratio) varies inversely with the number of users.  In a bursty traffic environment like mobile telephony, the advantage afforded by asynchronous CDMA is that the performance (bit error rate) is allowed to fluctuate randomly, with an average value determined by the number of users times the percentage of utilization.  Suppose there are 2''N'' users that only talk half of the time, then 2''N'' users can be accommodated with the same ''average'' bit error probability as ''N'' users that talk all of the time.  The key difference here is that the bit error probability for ''N'' users talking all of the time is constant, whereas it is a ''random'' quantity (with the same mean) for 2''N'' users talking half of the time.\n\nIn other words, asynchronous CDMA is ideally suited to a mobile network where large numbers of transmitters each generate a relatively small amount of traffic at irregular intervals. CDM (synchronous CDMA), TDMA, and FDMA systems cannot recover the underutilized resources inherent to bursty traffic due to the fixed number of [[orthogonal]] codes, time slots or frequency channels that can be assigned to individual transmitters. For instance, if there are ''N'' time slots in a TDMA system and 2''N'' users that talk half of the time, then half of the time there will be more than ''N'' users needing to use more than ''N'' time slots.  Furthermore, it would require significant overhead to continually allocate and deallocate the orthogonal-code, time-slot or frequency-channel resources. By comparison, asynchronous CDMA transmitters simply send when they have something to say and go off the air when they don't, keeping the same PN signature sequence as long as they are connected to the system.\n\n===Spread-spectrum characteristics of CDMA===\nMost modulation schemes try to minimize the bandwidth of this signal since bandwidth is a limited resource.  However, spread-spectrum techniques use a transmission bandwidth that is several orders of magnitude greater than the minimum required signal bandwidth.  One of the initial reasons for doing this was military applications including guidance and communication systems. These systems were designed using spread spectrum because of its security and resistance to jamming.  Asynchronous CDMA has some level of privacy built in because the signal is spread using a pseudo-random code; this code makes the spread-spectrum signals appear random or have noise-like properties.  A receiver cannot demodulate this transmission without knowledge of the pseudo-random sequence used to encode the data.  CDMA is also resistant to jamming.  A jamming signal only has a finite amount of power available to jam the signal.  The jammer can either spread its energy over the entire bandwidth of the signal or jam only part of the entire signal.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | first = Bernard\n | last = Skylar\n | year = 2001\n | title = Digital Communications: Fundamentals and Applications\n | edition = Second\n | publisher = Prentice-Hall PTR.\n | ISBN =\n}}</ref>\n\nCDMA can also effectively reject narrow-band interference.  Since narrow-band interference affects only a small portion of the spread-spectrum signal, it can easily be removed through notch filtering without much loss of information.  [[Convolution encoding]] and [[forward error correction#Interleaving|interleaving]] can be used to assist in recovering this lost data.  CDMA signals are also resistant to multipath fading.  Since the spread-spectrum signal occupies a large bandwidth, only a small portion of this will undergo fading due to multipath at any given time.  Like the narrow-band interference, this will result in only a small loss of data and can be overcome.\n\nAnother reason CDMA is resistant to multipath interference is because the delayed versions of the transmitted pseudo-random codes will have poor correlation with the original pseudo-random code, and will thus appear as another user, which is ignored at the receiver.  In other words, as long as the multipath channel induces at least one chip of delay, the multipath signals will arrive at the receiver such that they are shifted in time by at least one chip from the intended signal.  The correlation properties of the pseudo-random codes are such that this slight delay causes the multipath to appear uncorrelated with the intended signal, and it is thus ignored.\n\nSome CDMA devices use a [[rake receiver]], which exploits multipath delay components to improve the performance of the system.\nA rake receiver combines the information from several correlators, each one tuned to a different path delay, producing a stronger version of the signal than a simple receiver with a single correlation tuned to the path delay of the strongest signal.<ref>\n{{cite book\n | first = Theodore S.\n | last = Rapporteur\n | year = 2002\n | title = Wireless Communications, Principles and Practice\n | edition =\n | publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc\n | isbn =\n}}</ref>\n\nFrequency reuse is the ability to reuse the same radio channel frequency at other cell sites within a cellular system.  In the FDMA and TDMA systems, frequency planning is an important consideration.  The frequencies used in different cells must be planned carefully to ensure signals from different cells do not interfere with each other.  In a CDMA system, the same frequency can be used in every cell, because channelization is done using the pseudo-random codes.  Reusing the same frequency in every cell eliminates the need for frequency planning in a CDMA system; however, planning of the different pseudo-random sequences must be done to ensure that the received signal from one cell does not correlate with the signal from a nearby cell.<ref name = \"xtsphp\">\n{{cite book\n | first = Lawrence, Richard, Romans\n | last = Harte, Levine, Kikta\n | year = 2002\n | title = 3G Wireless Demystified\n | edition =\n | publisher = McGowan-Hill\n | isbn =\n}}</ref>\n\nSince adjacent cells use the same frequencies, CDMA systems have the ability to perform soft hand-offs.  Soft hand-offs allow the mobile telephone to communicate simultaneously with two or more cells.  The best signal quality is selected until the hand-off is complete.  This is different from hard hand-offs utilized in other cellular systems.  In a hard-hand-off situation, as the mobile telephone approaches a hand-off, signal strength may vary abruptly. In contrast, CDMA systems use the soft hand-off, which is undetectable and provides a more reliable and higher-quality signal.<ref name = \"xtsphp\"/>\n\n==Collaborative CDMA==\nIn a recent study, a novel collaborative multi-user transmission and detection scheme called collaborative CDMA<ref>{{cite news\n | first = Indu L.\n | last = Shakya\n | year = 2011\n | title = High User Capacity Collaborative CDMA\n | edition =\n | publisher = IET Communications\n}}</ref> has been investigated for the uplink that exploits the differences between users' fading channel signatures to increase the user capacity well beyond the spreading length in the MAI-limited environment. The authors show that it is possible to achieve this increase at a low complexity and high [[bit error rate]] performance in flat fading channels, which is a major research challenge for overloaded CDMA systems. In this approach, instead of using one sequence per user as in conventional CDMA, the authors group a small number of users to share the same spreading sequence and enable group spreading and despreading operations. The new collaborative multi-user receiver consists of two stages: group multi-user detection (MUD) stage to suppress the MAI between the groups and a low-complexity maximum-likelihood detection stage to recover jointly the co-spread users' data using minimal Euclidean-distance measure and users' channel-gain coefficients.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|CDMA}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[CDMA spectral efficiency]]\n* [[CDMA2000]]\n* [[IS-95|cdmaOne]]\n* [[Comparison of mobile phone standards]]\n* [[Orthogonal variable spreading factor]] (OVSF), an implementation of CDMA\n* [[Pseudo-random noise]]\n* [[Quadrature-division multiple access]] (QDMA), an implementation of CDMA\n* [[Spread spectrum]]\n* [[W-CDMA]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book\n | first = Andrew J.\n | last = Viterbi\n | authorlink = Andrew Viterbi\n | year = 1995\n | title = CDMA: Principles of Spread Spectrum Communication\n | edition = 1st\n | publisher = Prentice Hall PTR\n | isbn = 0-201-63374-4\n}}\n*{{cite web\n | last=\n | first =\n | title=CDMA Spectrum\n | publisher=\n | year=\n | work=\n | url= http://www.activexperts.com/asmssrvr/cellular/cdmaspectrum/\n | accessdate=2008-04-29\n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.cdg.org/ CDMA Development Group]\n*[http://video.ias.edu/goresky-lecture-4-13   Talk at Princeton Institute for Advanced Study on Solomon Golomb's work on pseudorandom sequences]\n{{cdma|state=uncollapsed}}{{Channel access methods}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Code Division Multiple Access}}\n[[Category:Code division multiple access| ]]\n[[Category:Multiplexing]]\n[[Category:Radio resource management]]\n[[Category:Media access control]]", "sha1": "l1gclja79jdenx3vfcsnyvcplpb6pvd"}}, {"title": "Content-control software", "ns": "0", "id": "7144", "revision": {"id": "866328549", "parentid": "862223511", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T18:10:20Z", "contributor": {"username": "Plartball", "id": "32973902"}, "comment": "Updated pronoun", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "'''Content-control software''', commonly referred to as an '''internet filter''', is [[software]] that restricts or controls the content an Internet user is capable to access, especially when utilised to restrict material delivered over the [[Internet]] via the [[World Wide Web|Web]], [[e-mail]], or other means. Content-control software determines what content will be available or be blocked.\n\nSuch restrictions can be applied at various levels: a government can attempt to apply them nationwide (see [[Internet censorship]]), or they can, for example, be applied by an [[ISP]] to its clients, by an employer to its personnel, by a school to its students, by a library to its visitors, by a parent to a child's computer, or by an [[self-censorship|individual user to their own computer]].\n\nThe motive is often to prevent access to content which the computer's owner(s) or other authorities may consider objectionable. When imposed without the consent of the user, content control can be characterised as a form of internet censorship. Some content-control software includes time control functions that empowers parents to set the amount of time that child may spend accessing the Internet or playing games or other computer activities.\n\nIn some countries, such software is ubiquitous.

Multiple free [[Public_recursive_name_server|public DNS services]] offer filtering options as part of their services.\n\n;Search-engine filters\n:Many search engines, such as Google and Bing offer users the option of turning on a safety filter. When this safety filter is activated, it filters out the inappropriate links from all of the search results.

In 1994, the [[Internet Content Rating Association]] (ICRA) &mdash; now part of the [[Family Online Safety Institute]] &mdash; developed a content rating system for online content providers. Using an online questionnaire a webmaster describes the nature of their web content. A small file is generated that contains a condensed, computer readable digest of this description that can then be used by content filtering software to block or allow that site.\n\nICRA labels come in a variety of formats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fosi.org/icra/#tech |title=ICRA: Technical standards used |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work= |publisher=FOSI |date= }}</ref> These include the World Wide Web Consortium's [[Resource Description Framework]] (RDF) as well as [[Platform for Internet Content Selection]] (PICS) labels used by [[Microsoft]]'s [[Internet Explorer]] Content Advisor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/ie6/using/howto/security/contentadv/config.mspx |title=Browse the Web with Internet Explorer 6 and Content Advisor |accessdate= |work= |publisher=Microsoft |date=March 26, 2003 }}</ref>\n\nICRA labels are an example of self-labeling. Similarly, in 2006 the [[Association of Sites Advocating Child Protection (ASACP)]] initiated the Restricted to Adults self-labeling initiative. ASACP members were concerned that various forms of legislation being proposed in the [[United States]] were going to have the effect of forcing adult companies to label their content.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asacp.org/page.php?content=news&item=511 |title=ASACP Participates in Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography  |accessdate=2008-07-04 |work= |publisher= |date=November 20, 2007 }}</ref> The RTA label, unlike ICRA labels, does not require a webmaster to fill out a questionnaire or sign up to use. Like ICRA the RTA label is free. Both labels are recognized by a [[List of Content Control Software|wide variety of content-control software]].\n\nThe [[Voluntary Content Rating]] (VCR) system was devised by [[Solid Oak Software]] for their [[CYBERsitter]] filtering software, as an alternative to the PICS system, which some critics deemed too complex. It employs [[HTML]] [[meta element|metadata]] tags embedded within web page documents to specify the type of content contained in the document. Only two levels are specified, ''mature'' and ''adult'', making the specification extremely simple.\n\n==Use in public libraries==\n\n===United States===\nThe use of Internet filters or content-control software varies widely in public libraries in the United States, since Internet use policies are established by the local library board. Many libraries adopted Internet filters after Congress conditioned the receipt of universal service discounts on the use of Internet filters through the [[Children's Internet Protection Act]] (CIPA). Other libraries do not install content control software, believing that acceptable use policies and educational efforts address the issue of children accessing [[age-inappropriate]] content while preserving adult users' right to freely access information. Some libraries use Internet filters on computers used by children only. Some libraries that employ content-control software allow the software to be deactivated on a case-by-case basis on application to a librarian; libraries that are subject to CIPA are required to have a policy that allows adults to request that the filter be disabled without having to explain the reason for their request.\n\nMany legal scholars believe that a number of legal cases, in particular ''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union]]'', established that the use of content-control software in libraries is a violation of the First Amendment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spectacle.org/cs/library.bak |title=Purchase of blocking software by public libraries is unconstitutional |accessdate= |last=Wallace |first=Jonathan D. |date=November 9, 1997 |work= |publisher=}}</ref> The Children's Internet Protection Act [CIPA] and the June 2003 case ''[[United States v. American Library Association]]'' found CIPA constitutional as a condition placed on the receipt of federal funding, stating that First Amendment concerns were dispelled by the law's provision that allowed adult library users to have the filtering software disabled, without having to explain the reasons for their request. The plurality decision left open a future \"as-applied\" Constitutional challenge, however.\n\nIn November 2006, a lawsuit was filed against the North Central Regional Library District (NCRL) in Washington State for its policy of refusing to disable restrictions upon requests of adult patrons, but CIPA was not challenged in that matter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aclu-wa.org/detail.cfm?id=557 |title=ACLU Suit Seeks Access to Information on Internet for Library Patrons |accessdate= |work= |publisher=ACLU of Washington |date=November 16, 2006 }}</ref> In May 2010, the Washington State Supreme Court provided an opinion after it was asked to certify a question referred by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington: \u201cWhether a public library, consistent with Article I, \u00a7 5 of the Washington Constitution, may filter Internet access for all patrons without disabling Web sites containing constitutionally-protected speech upon the request of an adult library patron.\u201d The Washington State Supreme Court ruled that NCRL\u2019s internet filtering policy did not violate Article I, Section 5 of the Washington State Constitution. The Court said: \u201cIt appears to us that NCRL\u2019s filtering policy is reasonable and accords with its mission and these policies and is viewpoint neutral. It appears that no article I, section 5 content-based violation exists in this case. NCRL\u2019s essential mission is to promote reading and lifelong learning. As NCRL maintains, it is reasonable to impose restrictions on Internet access in order to maintain an environment that is conducive to study and contemplative thought.\u201d The case returned to federal court.\n\nIn March 2007, Virginia passed a law similar to CIPA that requires public libraries receiving state funds to use content-control software. Like CIPA, the law requires libraries to disable filters for an adult library user when requested to do so by the user.<ref>{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Sluss |title=Kaine signs library bill: The legislation requires public libraries to block obscene material with Internet filters |url=http://www.roanoke.com/politics/wb/wb/xp-109919 |work= |publisher=The Roanoke Times |date=March 23, 2007 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n===Australia===\nThe Australian Internet Safety Advisory Body has information about \"practical advice on Internet safety, parental control and filters for the protection of children, students and families\" that also includes public libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcw.vic.edu.au/Our%20School/Parents%20Guide%20to%20Internet%20Safety.pdf |title=NetAlert: Parents Guide to Internet Safety |publisher=Australian Communications and Media Authority |date=2 August 2007 |accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nNetAlert, the software made available free of charge by the Australian government, was allegedly cracked by a 16-year-old student, Tom Wood, less than a week after its release in August 2007.

Also cached web pages returned by Google or other searches could bypass some controls as well. Web syndication services may provide alternate paths for content. Some of the more poorly designed programs can be shut down by killing their processes: for example, in [[Microsoft Windows]] through the Windows [[Task Manager]], or in [[Mac OS X]] using Force Quit or [[Activity Monitor (macOS)|Activity Monitor]]. Numerous workarounds and counters to workarounds from content-control software creators exist.\n[[Google]] services are often blocked by filters, but these may most often be bypassed by using ''https://'' in place of ''http://'' since content filtering software is not able to interpret content under secure connections (in this case SSL).\n\nMany content filters have an option which allows authorized people to bypass the content filter. This is especially useful in environments where the computer is being supervised and the content filter is aggressively blocking Web sites that need to be accessed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\nAn encrypted [[VPN]] can be used as means of bypassing content control software, especially if the content control software is installed on an Internet gateway or firewall.\n\nThere many other ways in which to bypass a content control filter that include translation sites, establishing a remote connection with another computer that has no content control filter on it and altering the proxy settings of the browser.<ref name=\"comdodome\">{{cite web |url=https://cdome.comodo.com/bypass-avoid-internet-filters.php |title=Is It Possible To Easily Avoid Internet Filters? |last=|first=|date=4 June 2007 |publisher=comodo.com |accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref> \n\nSometimes, an antivirus software with web protection may stop the content-control filter.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}\n\n==Products and services==\n{{See also|List of content-control software|Category:Content-control software}}\nSome ISPs offer [[parental control]] options. Some offer security software which includes parental controls. [[Mac OS X v10.4]] offers parental controls for several applications ([[Mail (OS X)|Mail]], [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]], [[iChat]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] & [[Dictionary (software)|Dictionary]]). Microsoft's [[Windows Vista]] operating system also includes content-control software.\n\nContent filtering technology exists in two major forms: [[Application-level gateway|application gateway]] or [[Deep packet inspection|packet inspection]]. For HTTP access the application gateway is called a web-proxy or just a proxy. Such web-proxies can inspect both the initial request and the returned web page using arbitrarily complex rules and will not return any part of the page to the requester until a decision is made. In addition they can make substitutions in whole or for any part of the returned result. Packet inspection filters do not initially interfere with the connection to the server but inspect the data in the connection as it goes past, at some point the filter may decide that the connection is to be filtered and it will then disconnect it by injecting a TCP-Reset or similar faked packet. The two techniques can be used together with the packet filter monitoring a link until it sees an HTTP connection starting to an IP address that has content that needs filtering. The packet filter then redirects the connection to the [[Proxy server#Intercepting proxy server|web-proxy]] which can perform detailed filtering on the website without having to pass through all unfiltered connections. This combination is [[Cleanfeed (content blocking system)|quite popular]] because it can significantly reduce the cost of the system.\n\nGateway-based content control software may be more difficult to bypass than desktop software as the user does not have physical access to the filtering device. However, many of the techniques in the [[Content-control software#Bypassing filters|Bypassing filters]] section still work.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adultism]]\n*[[Ad filtering]]\n*[[Comparison of content-control software and providers]] (incl. parental control software)\n*[[Computer and network surveillance]]\n*[[David Burt (filtering advocate)|David Burt]], a former librarian and advocate for content-control software\n*[[Deep content inspection]]\n*[[Egress filtering]], control of outbound network traffic\n*[[Financial Coalition Against Child Pornography]]\n*[[Internet censorship]]\n*[[Internet censorship circumvention]]\n*[[Internet safety]]\n*[[Opposition to pornography]]\n*[[Parental controls]]\n*[[Peacefire]], a U.S.-based website dedicated to \"preserving First Amendment rights for Internet users, particularly those younger than 18\"\n*[[Russian State Duma Bill 89417-6]] - a proposed bill that would mandate content control software\n*[[Wordfilter]], generic name for scripts typically used on Internet forums or chat rooms that automatically scans users' posts or comments as they are submitted and automatically changes or censors particular words or phrases\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{Wiktionary|censorware}}{{Censorship}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Content-Control Software}}\n[[Category:Content-control software| ]]\n[[Category:Web browsers]]\n[[Category:Internet censorship]]\n[[Category:Digital rights management]]", "sha1": "jhhoowpre19p5ese9rbqmmln24ueb6l"}}, {"title": "Chambered cairn", "ns": "0", "id": "7145", "revision": {"id": "848475949", "parentid": "824774621", "timestamp": "2018-07-02T04:17:05Z", "contributor": {"username": "Me, Myself, and I are Here", "id": "17619453"}, "minor": "", "comment": "fixed [[MOS:DASH|dashes]] using a [[User:GregU/dashes.js|script]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "[[File:Maes Howe Cross Sections.gif|thumb|Cross sections of [[Maeshowe]]]]\nA '''chambered cairn''' is a burial monument, usually constructed during the [[Neolithic]], consisting of a sizeable (usually stone) chamber around and over which a [[cairn]] of stones was constructed. Some chambered cairns are also [[passage grave|passage-graves]]. They are found throughout [[Prehistoric Britain|Britain]] and [[Ireland]], with the largest number in [[Scotland]].\n\nTypically, the chamber is larger than a [[cist]], and will contain a larger number of interments, which are either [[Excarnation|excarnated]] bones or inhumations (cremations). Most were situated near a settlement, and served as that community's \"graveyard\".\n\n==Scotland==\n[[File:Cairn Holy, Galloway.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Cairn Holy I., Galloway]]\n\n===Background===\nDuring the early Neolithic (4000\u20133300 BC) architectural forms are highly regionalised with timber and earth monuments predominating in the east and stone-chambered cairns in the west. During the later Neolithic (3300\u20132500 BC) massive circular enclosures and the use of [[grooved ware]] and [[Unstan ware]] pottery emerge.<ref>Noble (2006) p. 15</ref> Scotland has a particularly large number of chambered cairns; they are found in various different types described below. Along with the excavations of settlements such as [[Skara Brae]], [[Links of Noltland]], [[Barnhouse]], [[Rinyo]] and [[Balfarg]] and the complex site at [[Ness of Brodgar]] these cairns provide important clues to the character of civilization in Scotland in the Neolithic.<ref>Barclay (2005) pp. 41, 46</ref> However the increasing use of [[cropmark]]s to identify Neolithic sites in [[Central Lowlands|lowland]] areas has tended to diminish the relative prominence of these cairns.<ref>Barclay, Gordon \"The Neolithic\" in Edwards and Ralston (2003) p. 131</ref>\n\nIn the early phases bones of numerous bodies are often found together and it has been argued that this suggests that in death at least, the status of individuals was played down.<ref>Barclay (2005) p. 20</ref> During the late Neolithic [[henge]] sites were constructed<ref>Barclay (2005) p. 29</ref> and single burials began to become more commonplace;  by the [[Bronze Age]] it is possible that even where chambered cairns were still being built they had become the burial places of prominent individuals rather than of communities as a whole.<ref name=B5255>Barclay (2005) pp. 52, 55</ref><ref>Barclay, Gordon \"The Neolithic\" in Edwards and Ralston (2003) pp. 132\u201333</ref>\n\n===Clyde-Carlingford court cairns===\n{{Main|Court cairn}}\n[[File:Cairnholy2.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Cairn Holy II \u2013 a chambered cairn near [[Newton Stewart]].]]\nThe Clyde or Clyde-Carlingford type are principally found in northern and western [[Ireland]] and southwestern Scotland. They first were identified as a separate group in the [[Firth of Clyde]] region, hence the name. Over 100 have been identified in Scotland alone. Lacking a significant passage, they are a form of [[gallery grave]]. The burial chamber is normally located at one end of a rectangular or trapezoidal cairn, while a roofless, semi-circular forecourt at the entrance provided access from the outside (although the entrance itself was often blocked), and gives this type of chambered cairn its alternate name of [[Court tomb|court tomb or court cairn]]. These forecourts are typically fronted by large stones and it is thought the area in front of the cairn was used for public rituals of some kind. The chambers were created from large stones set on end, roofed with large flat stones and often sub-divided by slabs into small compartments. They are generally considered to be the earliest in Scotland.<ref>Noble (2006) pp. 104\u201305</ref>\n\nExamples include [[Cairnholy|Cairn Holy I and Cairn Holy II]] near [[Newton Stewart]],<ref>Noble (2006) pp. 111\u201312</ref> a cairn at [[Port Charlotte, Islay|Port Charlotte]], [[Islay]], which dates to 3900\u20134000 BC,<ref name=N108>Noble (2006) p. 108</ref><ref>[http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/37313/details/islay+port+charlotte/ \"Islay, Port Charlotte\"].

It has been subdivided into Yarrows, Camster and Cromarty subtypes but the differences are extremely subtle. The design is of dividing slabs at either side of a rectangular chamber, separating it into compartments or stalls.<ref name=Ritch29>Ritchie, Graham \"The Early Peoples\" in Omand (2003) p. 29</ref> The number of these compartments ranges from 4 in the earliest examples to over 24 in an extreme example on [[Orkney]].

It is likely that these are the result of cultural influences from mainland [[Europe]], as they are similar to designs found in [[France]] and [[Spain]].\n\nExamples include [[Midhowe Chambered Cairn|Midhowe]] on [[Rousay]] and [[Unstan Chambered Cairn]] from the [[Mainland, Orkney|Orkney Mainland]], both of which date from the mid 4th millennium BC and were probably in use over long periods of time.

While rum was the primary alcoholic product distilled in the cities, a result of access to sugar from British colonial plantations, excess grain being harvested in the rural areas was distilled in small batches. The first commercial scale production of whisky in Canada began in 1801 when [[John Molson]] purchased a copper pot still, previously used to produce rum in Montreal. John's son [[Thomas Molson|Thomas]] took an interest in producing whisky, first in the Molson distillery then independently in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] from 1821 to 1834 but left it to [[James Morton (Canadian businessman)|James Morton]] as the family focused on their brewery. Molson, the largest distillery in Canada at the time, had exported most of this early whisky to Britain where tastes were shifting away from French wine and brandies to whiskies as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. [[Gooderham and Worts]] began producing whisky in 1837 in Toronto as a side business to their wheat milling but surpassed Molson's production by the 1850s as it expanded their operations with a new distillery in what would become the [[Distillery District]]. [[Henry Corby]] started distilling whisky as a side business from his gristmill in 1859 in what became known as [[Corbyville, Ontario|Corbyville]] and [[Joseph E. Seagram|Joseph Seagram]] began working in his father-in-law's [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] flour mill and distillery in 1864, which he would eventually purchase in 1883. Meanwhile, Americans [[Hiram Walker]] and [[John Philip Wiser|J.P. Wiser]] moved to Canada: Walker to [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] in 1858 to open a flour mill and distillery and Wiser to [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]] in 1857 to work at his uncle's distillery where he introduced a rye whisky and was successful enough to buy the distillery five years later. The disruption of [[American Civil War]] created an export opportunity for Canadian-made whiskies and their quality, particularly those from Walker and Wiser who had already begun the practice of aging their whiskies, sustained that market even after post-war tariffs were introduced.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mensjournal.com/food-drink/canadian-whisky-makes-a-big-comeback-20150209/ |publisher=[[Men's Journal]] |title=Canadian Whisky Makes a Big Comeback |first=Margaret |last=Eby|date=2015 |accessdate=October 12, 2018}}</ref> In the 1880s, Canada's [[National Policy]] placed high tariffs on foreign alcoholic products as whisky began to be sold in bottles and the federal government instituted a [[bottled in bond]] program that provided certification of the time a whisky spent aging and allowed deferral of taxes for that period, which encouraged aging. In 1890 Canada became the first country to enact an aging law for whiskies, requiring them to be aged at least two years. The growing [[temperance movement]] culminated in [[Prohibition in Canada|prohibition]] in 1916 and distilleries had to either specialize in the export market or switch to alternative products, like industrial alcohols which were in demand in support of the [[war effort]].<ref name=Kergommeaux>{{cite book |title=Canadian Whisky: The portable expert |first=Davin |last= Kergommeaux |publisher=McClelland & Stewart |year=2012 |isbn=9780771027437 |pages=93-187}}</ref>\n\nWith the deferred revenue and storage costs of the Aging Law acting as a barrier to new entrants and the reduced market due to prohibition, consolidation of Canadian whisky had begun. [[Henry Corby Jr.]] modernized and expanded upon his father's distillery and sold it, in 1905, to businessman [[Mortimer Davis]] who also purchased the Wiser distillery, in 1918, from the heirs of J.P. Wiser. Davis's salesman [[Harry C. Hatch|Harry Hatch]] spent time promoting the brands and developing a distribution network in the United States. As Canadian prohibition ended and [[Prohibition in the United States|American prohibition]] began, Corby and Wiser whiskies profited from this network. After Hatch's falling out with Davis, Hatch purchased the struggling [[Gooderham and Worts]] in 1923 and switched out Davis's whisky for his.<ref name=Kergommeaux/> Hatch was successful enough to be able to also purchase the Walker distillery, and the popular [[Canadian Club]] brand, from Hiram's grandsons in 1926.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/the-old-booze-barons/article17975561/ |title=The old booze barons |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=November 28, 2008 |accessdate=October 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Illicit export to the United States===\t\nCanadian whisky featured prominently in [[rum-running]] into the U.S. during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]].

Most collective nouns in everyday speech are mundane and ''not'' specific to just one kind, such as the word \"group\", which is applied to \"people\" in the phrase \"a group of people\", but is also applied to \"dogs\" in the phrase \"a group of dogs\". Other collective nouns ''are specific'' to one kind, especially [[#Terms of venery|terms of venery]], which identify specific groups of animals. For example, \"pride\" as a term of [[game (hunting)|venery]] always refers to [[lion]]s, never to [[dog]]s or [[cow]]s. Similarly, a group of owls is called a \"congress\".\n\nDifferent forms of English handle verb [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective [[count noun]]s differently; in particular, users of [[British English]] generally accept that collective nouns take either singular or plural verb forms depending on context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies.\n\n== Derivation ==\n[[Morphological derivation]] accounts for many collective words and various languages have common [[affix]]es for denoting collective nouns. Because derivation is a slower and less productive [[word formation]] process than the more overtly [[syntax|syntactical]] morphological methods, there are fewer collectives formed this way. As with all derived words, derivational collectives often differ [[Semantics|semantically]] from the original words, acquiring new [[connotation]]s and even new [[denotation]]s.\n\n== Affixes ==\n\n=== Proto-Indo-European===\nEarly Proto-Indo-European used the suffix *eh2 to form collective nouns. From there we have, for example, the Latin neuter plural ending -a. Late Proto-Indo-European used the ending *t. From there we have the English ending -th, as in \"youth\".\n\n=== English ===\nThe English endings ''-age'' and ''-ade'' often signify a collective. Sometimes, the relationship is easily recognizable: ''baggage, drainage, blockade.'' Though the [[etymology]] is plain to see, the derived words take on a distinct meaning. This is a [[Productive (linguistics)|productive]] ending, as evidenced in the recent [[Coined word|coin]], \"[[signage]]\".\n\n=== German ===\n[[German language|German]] uses the [[prefix]] ''[[wikt:ge-#German|ge]]-'' to create collectives. The root word often undergoes [[I-mutation|umlaut]] and [[suffix]]ation as well as receiving the ''ge-'' prefix. Nearly all nouns created in that way are of [[neuter gender]]:\n* ''{{lang|de|das Gebirge}}'', \"group of hills, mountain range\" {{abbr|<|from}} ''{{lang|de|der Berg}}'', \"mountain\" or \"hill\"\n* ''{{lang|de|das Gep\u00e4ck}}'', \"luggage, baggage\" < ''{{lang|de|der Pack}}'', \"pack, bundle, pile\"\n* ''{{lang|de|das Gefl\u00fcgel}}'', \"poultry, fowl (birds)\" < late [[Middle High German|MHG]] ''{{lang|gmh|gevl\u00fcgel(e)}}'', under the influence of ''{{lang|de|der Fl\u00fcgel}}'', \"wing\" < MHG ''{{lang|gmh|gev\u00fcgel}}'' < [[Old High German|OHG]] ''{{lang|goh|gifugili}}'' = collective formation of ''{{lang|goh|fogal}}'', \"bird\"\n* ''{{lang|de|das Gefieder}}'', \"plumage\" < ''{{lang|de|die Feder}}'', \"feather\"\n* ''{{lang|de|das Geschwisterkind}}'', \"sibling\" < ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', \"sister\"\n* ''{{lang|de|die Geschwister}}'', \"siblings\" < ''{{lang|de|die Schwester}}'', \"sister\"\n* \"Der Gebirgszug\" and \"die Bergkette\" also mean \"mountain range\", drawing on the words \"der Zug\" = train, and \"die Kette\" = chain.\nThere are also several endings that can be used to create collectives, such as \"welt\" and \"masse\".\n\n=== Dutch ===\n[[Dutch language|Dutch]] has a similar pattern but sometimes uses the (unproductive) [[circumfix]] ''{{linktext|ge- -te}}'':<ref>{{cite book|title=The Morphology of Dutch|last=Booij|first=Geert|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n* ''{{lang|nl|berg}}'' 'mountain' > ''{{lang|nl|gebergte}}'' 'mountain range'\n* ''{{lang|nl|been}}'' 'bone' > ''{{lang|nl|gebeente}}'' 'skeleton'\n* ''{{lang|nl|vogel}}'' 'bird' > ''{{lang|nl|gevogelte}}'' 'poultry'\n* ''{{lang|nl|blad}}'' 'leaf' > ''{{lang|nl|gebladerte}}'' 'foliage'\n\n=== Swedish ===\nThe following [[Swedish language|Swedish]] example has different words in the collective form and in the individual form:\n* An individual mosquito is a ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygga|mygga]]}}'' (plural: ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:myggor|myggor]]}}''), but mosquitos as a collective is ''{{lang|sv|[[wikt:mygg|mygg]]}}''.\n\n=== Esperanto ===\n[[Esperanto]] uses the collective suffix -''[[wikt:-ar#Esperanto|ar]]'' to produce a large number of derived words:\n* ''monto'' 'mountain' > ''montaro'' 'mountain range'\n* ''birdo'' 'bird' > ''birdaro'' 'flock'\n* ''arbo'' 'tree' > ''arbaro'' 'forest'\n* ''\u015dipo'' 'ship' > ''\u015diparo'' 'fleet'\n* ''man\u011dilo'' 'eating utensil' > ''man\u011dilaro'' 'silverware', 'cutlery'\n\n== Metonymic merging of grammatical number ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}{{Main|Synesis|Plurale tantum}}Two good examples of collective nouns are \"team\" and \"government\", which are both words referring to groups of (usually) people. Both \"team\" and \"government\" are [[count noun]]s (consider: \"one team\", \"two teams\", \"most teams\"; \"one government\", \"two governments\", \"many governments\").\n\n=== Agreement in different forms of English ===\n{{Main|American and British English grammatical differences#Subject-verb_agreement}}\n\nConfusion often stems from the way that different forms of English handle [[Agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with collective nouns. The [[plural verb]] forms are often used in [[British English]] with the singular forms of these [[count noun]]s (e.g., \"The team ''have'' finished the project.\"). Conversely, in the English language as a whole, singular verb forms can often be used with nouns ending in \"-s\" that were once considered plural (e.g., \"Physics ''is'' my favorite academic subject\"). This apparent \"number mismatch\" is a natural and logical feature of human language, and its mechanism is a subtle [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift in the concepts underlying the words.\n\nIn British English, it is generally accepted that collective nouns can take either singular or plural verb forms depending on the context and the [[metonymy|metonymic]] shift that it implies. For example, \"the team ''is'' in the dressing room\" (''[[formal agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as an ensemble, while \"the team ''are'' fighting among themselves\" (''[[notional agreement]]'') refers to ''the team'' as individuals. That is also the British English practice with names of countries and cities in sports contexts (e.g., \"[[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]] ''have'' won the competition.\").\n\nIn [[American English]], collective nouns almost always take singular verb forms (formal agreement). In cases that a metonymic shift would be revealed nearby, the whole sentence should be recast to avoid the metonymy. (For example, \"The team are fighting among themselves\" may become \"the team ''members'' are fighting among themselves\" or simply \"The team is infighting.\") Collective [[proper noun]]s are usually taken as singular (\"[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] is expected to release a new phone this year\"), unless the plural is explicit in the proper noun itself, in which case it is taken as plural (\"The [[Green Bay Packers]] are scheduled to play the [[Minnesota Vikings]] this weekend\").\nMore explicit examples of collective proper nouns include \"[[General Motors]] is once again the world's largest producer of vehicles,\" and \"[[Texas Instruments]] is a large producer of [[electronics]] here,\" and \"[[British Airways]] is an airline company in Europe.\" Furthermore, \"[[American Telephone & Telegraph]]\" is a [[telecommunications]] company in North America.\" Such phrases might look plural, but they are not.\n\n=== Examples of metonymic shift ===\nA good example of such a metonymic shift in the singular-to-plural direction (which, generally, occurs only in British English) is the following sentence: \"The team have finished the project.\" In that sentence, the underlying thought is of the individual members of the team working together to finish the project. Their accomplishment is collective, and the emphasis is not on their individual identities, but they are still discrete individuals; the word choice \"team have\" manages to convey both their collective and discrete identities simultaneously. A good example of such a metonymic shift in the plural-to-singular direction is the following sentence: \"Mathematics is my favorite academic subject.\" The word \"mathematics\" may have originally been plural in concept, referring to mathematic endeavors, but metonymic shift (the shift in concept from \"the endeavors\" to \"the whole set of endeavors\") produced the usage of \"mathematics\" as a singular entity taking singular verb forms. (A true [[mass noun|mass-noun]] sense of \"mathematics\" followed naturally.)\n\nNominally singular pronouns can be collective nouns taking plural verbs, according to the same rules that apply to other collective nouns. For example, it is correct usage in both British English and American English usage to say: \"None are so fallible as those who are sure they're right.\" In that case, the plural verb is used because the context for \"none\" suggests more than one thing or person.<ref>Strunk & White, The Elements of Style (4th ed., 2000), p. 10.</ref>\n\n== Terms of venery ==\n{{further|List of English terms of venery, by animal}}\nThe tradition of using \"terms of [[game (hunting)|venery]]\" or \"nouns of assembly\", collective nouns that are specific to certain kinds of animals, stems from an [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[medieval hunting|hunting tradition]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The fashion of a consciously developed hunting language came to England from [[medieval France|France]]. It was marked by an extensive proliferation of specialist vocabulary, applying different names to the same feature in different animals. The elements can be shown to have already been part of French and English hunting terminology by the beginning of the 14th century. In the course of the 14th century, it became a courtly fashion to extend the vocabulary, and by the 15th century, the tendency had reached exaggerated proportions.\n\n''[[The Treatise (Walter of Bibbesworth)|The Treatise]]'', written by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]] in the mid-1200s, is the earliest source for collective nouns of animals in any European vernacular (and also the earliest source for animal noises).<ref>William Sayers, \"Animal vocalization and human polyglossia in Walter of Bibbesworth's 13th-century domestic treatise in Anglo-Norman French\" in Sign System Studies (Tartu, 2009) pp. 173\u2013187</ref> The ''Venerie'' of Twiti (early 14th century) distinguished three types of [[droppings]] of animals, and three different terms for [[herd]]s of animals. [[Gaston Phoebus]] (14th century) had five terms for droppings of animals, which were extended to seven in the ''Master of the Game'' (early 15th century). The focus on collective terms for groups of animals emerged in the later 15th century. Thus, a list of collective nouns in Egerton MS 1995, dated to c. 1452 under the heading of \"termis of venery &c.''\"'', extends to 70 items,<ref>David Dalby, ''Lexicon of the Mediaeval German Hunt: A Lexicon of Middle High German Terms (1050\u20131500), Associated with the Chase, Hunting with Bows, Falconry, Trapping and Fowling'', Walter de Gruyter, 1965, {{ISBN|978-3-11-081860-4}}, p. xli.</ref> and the list in the ''[[Book of Saint Albans]]'' (1486) runs to 165 items, many of which, even though introduced by \"the compaynys of beestys and fowlys\", relate not to venery but to human groups and professions and are clearly humorous, such as \"a Doctryne of doctoris\"'', \"''a Sentence of Juges\"'', \"''a Fightyng of beggers\"'', \"''an uncredibilite of Cocoldis\"'', \"''a Melody of harpers\"'', \"''a Gagle of women\"'', \"''a Disworship of Scottis\", etc.<ref>1901 facsimile reprint, E.

[[Gervase Markham]] edited and commented on the list in his ''The Gentleman's Academic'', in 1595.

Tramlink then follows the former [[Woodside and South Croydon Railway]] to reach the current Addiscombe tram stop, adjacent to the site of the demolished [[Bingham Road railway station]]. It continues along the former railway route to near Sandilands where Tramlink curves sharply towards Sandilands tram stop.

In 2007 that payment was \u00a34m, with an annual increase in rate.<ref name=tfln7741>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx|title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services|accessdate=18 March 2008 |publisher=[[Transport for London]]|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |archivedate = 12 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008 TfL introduced a new livery, using the blue, white and green of the routes on TfL maps, to distinguish the trams from buses operating in the area.

They are unstaffed and had automated ticket machines that are no longer in use due to TfL making trams cashless. In general, access between the platforms involves crossing the tracks by pedestrian level crossing.\nThere are 39 stops, most being {{convert|32.2|m|abbr=on}} long. They are virtually level with the doors and are all wider than {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}}. This allows [[wheelchair]]s, [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|prams]], [[Baby transport#Wheeled devices|pushchairs]] and the elderly to board the tram easily with no steps. In street sections, the stop is integrated with the pavement.\n\nTramlink uses some former main-line stations on the Wimbledon\u2013West Croydon and Elmers End\u2013Coombe Lane stretches of line. The railway platforms have been demolished and rebuilt to Tramlink specifications, except at Elmers End and Wimbledon where the track level was raised to meet the higher main-line platforms to enable [[cross-platform interchange]].\n\nThirty-eight stops opened in the phased introduction of tram services in May 2000. [[Centrale tram stop]] in Tamworth Road opened on 10 December 2005, increasing journey times slightly. As turnround times were already quite tight this raised the issue of buying an extra tram to maintain punctuality. Partly for this reason but also to take into account the planned restructuring of services (subsequently introduced in July 2006), TfL issued tenders for a new tram. However, nothing resulted from this.\n\nAll stops have disabled access, raised paving, CCTV, a Passenger Help Point, a Passenger Information Display (PID), litter bins, a ticket machine, a noticeboard and lamp-posts, and most also have seats and a shelter.\n\nThe PIDs display the destinations and expected arrival times of the next two trams. They can also display any message the controllers want to display, such as information on delays or even instructions to vandals to stop placing objects on the track.\n\n===Routes===\n[[File:Tramlink Route 2 at Beckenham Junction.jpg|thumb|Tram 2545 in original livery at [[Beckenham Junction]] in 2001.]]\n[[File:Tramlink-Tram2536-03.jpg|thumb|Tram 2536 in the second livery at [[Morden Road tram stop|Morden Road]], heading towards Wimbledon in 2006.]]\n[[File:Tram at Reeves Corner, Croydon - geograph.org.uk - 1238898.jpg|thumb|A tram leaving Croydon towards Wimbledon, going past [[Reeves Corner]] in 2009.]]\n[[File:Au Morandarte Flickr Tramlink 2558 on Route 1, East Croydon (9756077682).jpg|thumb|Tram 2558 at [[East Croydon]] in 2013.]]\n\nTramlink has been shown on the principal [[tube map]] since 1 June 2016, having previously appeared only on the [[Tube map#Official versions of the Tube map|\"London Connections\" map]].\n\nWhen Tramlink first opened it had three routes: Line 1 (yellow) from [[Wimbledon station|Wimbledon]] to [[Elmers End station|Elmers End]], Line 2 (red) from Croydon to [[Beckenham Junction station|Beckenham Junction]], and Line 3 (green) from Croydon to [[New Addington tram stop|New Addington]].<ref name=\"Tramlink p 10\">''Tramlink: Your top 10 questions answered\u2026'' Poster, 1995.</ref> On 23 July 2006 the network was restructured, with Route 1 from Elmers End to Croydon, Route 2 from Beckenham Junction to Croydon and Route 3 from New Addington to Wimbledon.

However, in the final masterplan planning application approved by Croydon Council and the Mayor of London, commitment by the Croydon Partnership to partially funding the loop was withdrawn, leading TfL and Croydon Council to review the affordability of the scheme.<ref>https://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/news/croydon-news/doubt-cast-over-funding-croydon-1387988</ref> In May 2018, it was announced a third of the cost for Elmers End improvements would be funded from the TfL Growth Fund, with work proposed to start later in the year.<ref>http://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/london-tram-enhancements-included-in-growth-fund.html</ref>\n\n====Phase B====\nAn increase in capacity westwards from Croydon centre could support housing growth at industrial and commercial areas in the Wandle Valley area; this could help fund the schemes through a housing levy, although this would require changes in planning allocation from both Croydon and Sutton councils.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> To achieve this, dual-tracking between Beddington Lane and Mitcham Junction and a second platform at Wimbledon was completed in November 2015, allowing for an initial 50% increase in capacity when the network was extended to Wimbledon.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |title= Wimbledon tram stop reopens with new platform |author= Transport for London |date= |website= tfl.gov.uk |accessdate= 9 May 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20170729054724/https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2015/november/wimbledon-tram-stop-reopens-with-new-platform |archivedate= 29 July 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> To further increase capacity by ~150%, a series of bottlenecks are proposed to be either resolved or avoided: as well as dual-tracking of line at Phipps Bridge and on the Wandle Flyover (between Reeves Corner and Wandle Park), a new route has been proposed between a spur in [[South Wimbledon tube station|South Wimbledon]] or [[Colliers Wood tube station|Colliers Wood]] and a reversing loop in Old Town, Croydon to avoid constraints at Wimbledon station and in Croydon.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This line could provide connections to the South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood Area for Intensification and the Northern Line, as well as supporting connections to the proposed [[London Overground#Future acquisitions|South London Metro]] at Mitcham Junction and West Croydon.<ref name=\"london.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The new service could initially run between Morden Road and Croydon before being extended to the new spur.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/> New stops would be built in South Wimbledon/Colliers Wood and in Old Town (initially proposed as Frith Road), as well as an additional platform at Reeves Corner for westward services.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This plan may be in service by 2023.<ref name=\"gov.uk\">{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425134041/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595947/london-south-coast-rail-corridor.pdf |archivedate=25 April 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n====Phase C====\nA 25% increase in capacity could be achieved by the introduction of another passing loop on the Beckenham Junction branch; the extra services could either be fed through Croydon centre or around the Dingwall Loop; this could be in place by 2027.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/> Furthermore, if extra capacity is required, tram stops could be lengthened to serve either longer trams or two trams coupled together on services between Wimbledon and Beckenham Junction or Elmers End; however, the expense required as well as issues from lengthening stops in the Croydon centre may prevent this.<ref name=\"content.tfl.gov.uk\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\nThis would be in place by 2029.<ref name=\"gov.uk\"/>\n\n====Other developments====\nThese developments could see an increase in fleet from 30 to up to 80 trams (depending on whether longer trams or coupled trams are used).

The first, principally between Wimbledon and Sutton, was in view even before Tramlink opened: the trams were delivered with this as \"line 4\" on their destination blinds.\n\n====Sutton to Wimbledon====\nThe Sutton to Wimbledon proposal utilises the existing line between Wimbledon and Morden Road, but the cramped terminus inside Wimbledon station is barely adequate for its present function. If another service is to serve Wimbledon a new terminus will be needed. Diverging from the present route, the Sutton line might adopt a segregated alignment within the highway along Morden Road, serving Morden station interchange. It would probably use Aberconway Road to reach Morden Hall Road before using the spacious St Helier Avenue as the direct route to St Helier, Rose Hill. St Helier Hospital is an important local traffic objective, despite the need to deviate from the direct route into Sutton via Angel Hill. A number of variants in Sutton Town centre are to be examined to see how the shopping centre, station and office complex can be accessed.\nThe alignment is served by busy bus routes and would give Tramlink direct with the Northern line at Morden. A south-to-east curve may also be considered at Morden Road to permit direct links from St Helier to Mitcham and Croydon.<ref>[http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/19 Proposals to extend the Tramlink system] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071111080806/http://www.alwaystouchout.com/project/19 |date=11 November 2007 }} Always Touch Out</ref>\n\nIn July 2013, Mayor Boris Johnson affirmed that there is a reasonable business case for Tramlink to cover the Wimbledon - Sutton corridor. A map has been released showing the planned route. It would leave the existing route just to the east of Morden Road and head along the A24 and A297 to Rosehill Roundabout, then the B2230 through Sutton town centre, ending at the station. A loop via St Helier Hospital and a possible extension to Royal Marsden Hospital also are shown. Stops would be at Morden Hall, Ivy Lodge, Boxley Road, Langdon Road, Middleton Road, Rosehill Roundabout, St Helier Hospital (on loop), Rosehill Park, Sutton Tennis Centre, Angel Hill, Sutton Green, High Street North, Crown Road (northbound only), St Nicholas Road (northbound only), Throwley Way (southbound only) and Sutton Station<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|title=Boris tells City Hall there is 'reasonable business case' for extending tram route to Sutton|author=|date=|website=Your Local Guardian|accessdate=9 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304120504/http://www.yourlocalguardian.co.uk/news/10557415.Boris_tells_City_Hall_there_is__reasonable_business_case__for_extending_tram_route_to_Sutton/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Sutton to Tooting====\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2016}}\nThe other Sutton proposal, to Tooting, is more ambitious and contains many more challenges than Sutton/Wimbledon link. Apart from workshop/depot facilities and a curve required to link the line into the existing system, this extension would share no infrastructure with it. If \"line 4\" is realised ahead of this proposal, the Tooting line would have the St Helier to Sutton section in common. North of St Helier, the alignment is likely to fit across parkland and open space to take in the Willow Lane Industrial Estate before serving Mitcham town centre. There would be some commonality here with the short separate proposal for a spur from Mitcham Junction to Mitcham town centre. From here, the extension would seek to use the pedestrianised town centre before sharing the carriageway with all traffic in London Road south of Figge\u2019s Marsh, with room for segregation beyond the junction with Streatham Road. The most difficult leg arises immediately the Merton/Wandsworth boundary is crossed and the most effective way of reaching Tooting Broadway from this point will stir much debate.\n\n====North and south from Croydon====\n[[File:Tram in Church Street - geograph.org.uk - 1209531.jpg|right|thumb|A tram travelling on Church Street, Croydon town centre]]\nTo the north and south of Croydon are some busy bus corridors, which derive from earlier tram routes.

Beyond Purley, an extension to [[Coulsdon]] will be investigated. As this would be close to the [[M23 motorway]], a possibility would be the construction of a [[park and ride]] site. Finding a good alignment will be more difficult south of Purley, where Brighton Road is the [[A23 road|A23 trunk road]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\nTo the north of Croydon, it is proposed to use a highway alignment based on London Road. To the south of [[Thornton Heath Pond]], the use of a shared carriageway is a possibility. North of this point the road becomes the A23 again, but there are likely to be some opportunities for [[trambaan]] type segregation to [[Norbury]] and between Norbury and Streatham, although Norbury is a pinch point. The proposal is to terminate the line at [[Streatham railway station]], providing an interchange to the extended [[East London Line]].<ref name=\"spext\"/>\n\n====Crystal Palace extension====\n[[File:Climbing the Addington Hills (5276420251).jpg|thumb|Near the summit of line 3, having climbed through the Addington Hills from Lloyd Park.]]\nThe proposed extension to [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace]] would have linked it to Harrington Road and Beckenham Junction, with services terminating at Crystal Palace Parade.<ref name=LambethCouncil>{{cite web|title=Croydon Tramlink extension to Crystal Palace|url=http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/Services/TransportStreets/PublicTransportTaxis/PublicTransportConsultation/ExtendingTramlinkToCrystalPalace.htm|work=Lambeth Council Website|publisher=Lambeth Council|accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> There were three options on how to get to the Parade: on-street, off-street and a mixture of the two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/trams/pdf/Crystal-Palace-2006-10-19.pdf |title=Crystal Palace extension options to reach the Parade |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |website=tfl.gov.uk |accessdate=9 May 2018}}</ref> After consultation in 2006 the off-street option was favoured, with trams running along existing railway as far as [[Crystal Palace railway station|Crystal Palace Station]], and then running round the western edge of [[Crystal Palace Park]] (within the current park's perimeter) to the bus terminus near the parade.

The symmetric modes consisting of two evanescent waves would form a catenary shape.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bourke|first=Levi|last2=Blaikie|first2=Richard J.|date=2017-12-01|title=Herpin effective media resonant underlayers and resonant overlayer designs for ultra-high NA interference lithography|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/josaa/abstract.cfm?uri=josaa-34-12-2243|journal=JOSA A|language=EN|volume=34|issue=12|pages=2243\u20132249|doi=10.1364/JOSAA.34.002243|pmid=29240100|issn=1520-8532}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pu|first=Mingbo|last2=Guo|first2=Yinghui|last3=Li|first3=Xiong|last4=Ma|first4=Xiaoliang|last5=Luo|first5=Xiangang|date=2018-07-05|title=Revisitation of Extraordinary Young's Interference: from Catenary Optical Fields to Spin\u2013Orbit Interaction in Metasurfaces|journal=ACS Photonics|volume=5|issue=8|pages=3198\u20133204|language=en|doi=10.1021/acsphotonics.8b00437|issn=2330-4022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pu|first=Mingbo|last2=Ma|first2=XiaoLiang|last3=Guo|first3=Yinghui|last4=Li|first4=Xiong|last5=Luo|first5=Xiangang|date=2018-07-23|title=Theory of microscopic meta-surface waves based on catenary optical fields and dispersion|url=https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-26-15-19555|journal=Optics Express|language=EN|volume=26|issue=15|pages=19555\u201319562|doi=10.1364/OE.26.019555|pmid=30114126|issn=1094-4087}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:GaudiCatenaryModel.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Antoni Gaud\u00ed]]'s catenary model at [[Casa Mil\u00e0]]]]\n\nThe word \"catenary\" is derived from the Latin word ''cat\u0113na'', which means \"[[chain]]\".

The equation can be determined in this case as follows:<ref>Following Todhunter Art. 186</ref>\nRelabel if necessary so that {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>}} is to the left of {{math|''P''<sub>2</sub>}} and let {{mvar|h}} be the horizontal and {{mvar|v}} be the vertical distance from {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''P''<sub>2</sub>}}. [[Translation (geometry)|Translate]] the axes so that the vertex of the catenary lies on the {{mvar|y}}-axis and its height {{mvar|a}} is adjusted so the catenary satisfies the standard equation of the curve\n \n:<math>y = a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x}{a}\\right)</math>\n\nand let the coordinates of {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''P''<sub>2</sub>}} be {{math|(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''y''<sub>1</sub>)}} and {{math|(''x''<sub>2</sub>, ''y''<sub>2</sub>)}} respectively. The curve passes through these points, so the difference of height is\n\n:<math>v = a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x_2}{a}\\right) - a \\cosh\\left(\\frac{x_1}{a}\\right)\\,.</math>\n\nand the length of the curve from {{math|''P''<sub>1</sub>}} to {{math|''P''<sub>2</sub>}} is\n\n:<math>s = a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x_2}{a}\\right) - a \\sinh\\left(\\frac{x_1}{a}\\right)\\,.</math>\n\nWhen {{math|''s''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''v''<sup>2</sup>}} is expanded using these expressions the result is\n\n:<math>s^2-v^2=2a^2\\left(\\cosh\\left(\\frac{x_2-x_1}{a}\\right)-1\\right)=4a^2\\sinh^2\\left(\\frac{h}{2a}\\right)\\,,</math>\nso\n:<math>\\sqrt{s^2-v^2}=2a\\sinh\\left(\\frac{h}{2a}\\right)\\,.</math>\n\nThis is a transcendental equation in {{mvar|a}} and must be solved [[Numerical analysis|numerically]]. It can be shown with the methods of calculus<ref>See [[#Routh|Routh]] art. 447</ref> that there is at most one solution with {{math|''a'' > 0}} and so there is at most one position of equilibrium.\n\n==Generalizations with vertical force==\n\n===Nonuniform chains===\nIf the density of the chain is variable then the analysis above can be adapted to produce equations for the curve given the density, or given the curve to find the density.<ref>Following [[#Routh|Routh]] Art. 450</ref>\n\nLet {{mvar|w}} denote the weight per unit length of the chain, then the weight of the chain has magnitude\n\n:<math>\\int_\\mathbf{c}^\\mathbf{r} w\\, ds\\,,</math>\n\nwhere the limits of integration are {{math|'''c'''}} and {{math|'''r'''}}.

Most [[suspension bridge]] cables follow a parabolic, not a catenary curve, due to the weight of the roadway being much greater than that of the cable.]]\n\nA similar analysis can be done to find the curve followed by the cable supporting a [[suspension bridge]] with a horizontal roadway.<ref>Following [[#Routh|Routh]] Art. 452</ref> If the weight of the roadway per unit length is {{mvar|w}} and the weight of the cable and the wire supporting the bridge is negligible in comparison, then the weight on the cable from {{math|'''c'''}} to {{math|'''r'''}} is {{mvar|wx}} where {{mvar|x}} is the horizontal distance between {{math|'''c'''}} and {{math|'''r'''}}. Proceeding as before gives the differential equation\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx}=\\tan \\varphi = \\frac{w}{T_0}x\\,. </math>\n\nThis is solved by simple integration to get\n\n:<math>y=\\frac{w}{2T_0}x^2 + \\beta</math>\n\nand so the cable follows a parabola. If the weight of the cable and supporting wires is not negligible then the analysis is more complex.<ref>Ira Freeman investigated the case where only the cable and roadway are significant, see the External links section. [[#Routh|Routh]] gives the case where only the supporting wires have significant weight as an exercise.</ref>\n\n===Catenary of equal strength===\nIn a catenary of equal strength, cable is strengthened according to the magnitude of the tension at each point, so its resistance to breaking is constant along its length. Assuming that the strength of the cable is proportional to its density per unit length, the weight, {{mvar|w}}, per unit length of the chain can be written {{mvar|{{sfrac|T|c}}}}, where {{mvar|c}} is constant, and the analysis for nonuniform chains can be applied.<ref>Following [[#Routh|Routh]] Art. 453</ref>\n\nIn this case the equations for tension are\n\n:<math>T \\cos \\varphi = T_0\\,,</math>\n:<math>T \\sin \\varphi = \\frac{1}{c}\\int T\\, ds\\,.</math>\n\nCombining gives\n\n:<math>c \\tan \\varphi = \\int \\sec \\varphi\\, ds</math>\n\nand by differentiation\n\n:<math>c = \\rho \\cos \\varphi</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c1}} is the radius of curvature.\n\nThe solution to this is\n\n:<math>y = c \\ln\\left(\\sec\\left(\\frac{x}{c}\\right)\\right)\\,.</math>\n\nIn this case, the curve has vertical asymptotes and this limits the span to {{math|\u03c0''c''}}.

At the rigid [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] where {{mvar|E}} is large, the shape of the curve reduces to that of a non-elastic chain.\n\n==Other generalizations==\n\n===Chain under a general force===\nWith no assumptions have been made regarding the force {{math|'''G'''}} acting on the chain, the following analysis can be made.<ref>Follows [[#Routh|Routh]] Art. 455</ref>\n\nFirst, let {{math|1='''T''' = '''T'''(''s'')}} be the force of tension as a function of {{mvar|s}}. The chain is flexible so it can only exert a force parallel to itself. Since tension is defined as the force that the chain exerts on itself, {{math|'''T'''}} must be parallel to the chain. In other words,\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{T} = T \\mathbf{u}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere {{mvar|T}} is the magnitude of {{math|'''T'''}} and {{math|'''u'''}} is the unit tangent vector.\n\nSecond, let {{math|1='''G''' = '''G'''(''s'')}} be the external force per unit length acting on a small segment of a chain as a function of {{mvar|s}}. The forces acting on the segment of the chain between {{mvar|s}} and {{math|''s'' + \u0394''s''}} are the force of tension {{math|'''T'''(''s'' + \u0394''s'')}} at one end of the segment, the nearly opposite force {{math|\u2212'''T'''(''s'')}} at the other end, and the external force acting on the segment which is approximately {{math|'''G'''\u0394''s''}}. These forces must balance so\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{T}(s+\\Delta s)-\\mathbf{T}(s)+\\mathbf{G}\\Delta s \\approx \\mathbf{0}\\,.</math>\n\nDivide by {{math|\u0394''s''}} and take the limit as {{math|\u0394''s'' \u2192 0}} to obtain\n\n:<math>\\frac{d\\mathbf{T}}{ds} + \\mathbf{G} = \\mathbf{0}\\,.</math>\n\nThese equations can be used as the starting point in the analysis of a flexible chain acting under any external force. In the case of the standard catenary, {{math|1='''G''' = (0, \u2212''\u03bbg'')}} where the chain has mass {{mvar|\u03bb}} per unit length and {{mvar|g}} is the acceleration of gravity.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Catenary arch]]\n* [[Chain fountain]] or self-siphoning beads\n* [[Overhead line]] \u2013 power lines suspended over rail or tram vehicles\n* [[Roulette (curve)]] \u2013 an elliptic/hyperbolic catenary\n* [[Troposkein]] \u2013 the shape of a spun rope\n* [[Weighted catenary]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{anchor|Lockwood}}{{cite book |title=A Book of Curves|first=E.H.|last=Lockwood|publisher=Cambridge|year=1961\n|chapter=Chapter 13: The Tractrix and Catenary|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofcurves006299mbp}}\n* {{cite book|last=Salmon|first=George | title=Higher Plane Curves\n|publisher=Hodges, Foster and Figgis|year=1879|pages=287\u2013289\n}}\n* {{anchor|Routh}}{{cite book| last = Routh| first = Edward John| authorlink = Edward Routh| title = A Treatise on Analytical Statics| url = https://books.google.com/?id=3N5JAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA315| year = 1891| publisher = University Press| chapter = Chapter X: On Strings }}\n* {{cite book| last = Maurer| first = Edward Rose| title = Technical Mechanics| url = https://books.google.com/?id=L98uAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA107| year = 1914| publisher = J.

An [[incandescent lamp]]'s light is thermal radiation, and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially the temperature of the filament. Thus a relatively low temperature emits a dull red and a high temperature emits the almost white of the traditional incandescent light bulb. Metal workers are able to judge the temperature of hot metals by their color, from dark red to orange-white and then white (see [[red heat]]).\n\nMany other light sources, such as [[fluorescent lamp]]s, or [[LED]]s (light emitting diodes) emit light primarily by processes other than thermal radiation. This means that the emitted radiation does not follow the form of a [[Planck's law|black-body spectrum]]. These sources are assigned what is known as a [[Color temperature#Correlated color temperature|correlated color temperature]] (CCT). CCT is the color temperature of a black-body radiator which to [[color vision|human color perception]] most closely matches the light from the lamp. Because such an approximation is not required for incandescent light, the CCT for an incandescent light is simply its unadjusted temperature, derived from comparison to a black-body radiator.\n\n===The Sun===\nThe [[Sun]] closely approximates a black-body radiator. The effective temperature, defined by the total radiative power per square unit, is about 5780&nbsp;K.<ref>{{cite web |last=Williams |first=D.

The changing color of the Sun over the course of the day is mainly a result of the [[scattering]] of light and is not due to changes in black-body radiation. The blue color of the sky is caused by [[Rayleigh scattering]] of the sunlight by the atmosphere, which tends to scatter blue light more than red light.\n\nSome early morning and evening light ([[golden hour (photography)|golden hours]]) has a lower color temperature due to increased low-wavelength light scattering by the [[Tyndall effect]].\n\nDaylight has a spectrum similar to that of a black body with a correlated color temperature of 6500&nbsp;K ([[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]] viewing standard) or 5500&nbsp;K (daylight-balanced photographic film standard).\n\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Color temperature black body 800-12200K.svg|thumb|center|512px|Hues of the Planckian locus on a logarithmic scale]]\n\nFor colors based on black-body theory, blue occurs at higher temperatures, whereas red occurs at lower temperatures.

This is equivalent to an increase of color temperature with water depth in this spectral range. Because coral typically live in shallow water and receive intense, direct tropical sunlight, the focus was once on simulating this situation with 6500&nbsp;K lights. In the meantime higher temperature light sources have become more popular, first with 10000&nbsp;K and more recently 16000&nbsp;K and 20000&nbsp;K.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  [[Actinic lighting]] at the violet end of the visible range (420\u2013460&nbsp;nm) is used to allow night viewing without increasing algae bloom or enhancing photosynthesis, and to make the somewhat [[fluorescent]] colors of many corals and fish \"pop\", creating brighter display tanks.\n\n===Digital photography===\nIn [[digital photography]], the term color temperature is sometimes used interchangeably with [[white balance]], which allow a remapping of color values to simulate variations in ambient color temperature. Most digital cameras and RAW image software provide presets simulating specific ambient values (e.g., sunny, cloudy, tungsten, etc.) while others allow explicit entry of white balance values in kelvins. These settings vary color values along the blue\u2013yellow axis, while some software includes additional controls (sometimes labeled \"tint\") adding the magenta\u2013green axis, and are to some extent arbitrary and a matter of artistic interpretation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chriskern.net/essay/realityCheck.html |title=Reality Check: Ambiguity and Ambivalence in Digital Color Photography |last=Kern |first=Chris |accessdate=2011-03-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722001411/http://www.chriskern.net/essay/realityCheck.html |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}</ref>\nUse of absolute color temperature values are unlikely to be popular with digital photographers, as those with physical science backgrounds will note. However the general idea of high K (blue-white) and low K (red-orange) will inform all who seek to experiment with their own hardware and software.\n\n===Photographic film===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nPhotographic emulsion film does not respond to lighting color identically to the human retina or visual perception. An object that appears to the observer to be white may turn out to be very blue or orange in a photograph. The [[color balance]] may need to be corrected during printing to achieve a neutral color print.  The extent of this correction is limited since color film normally has three layers sensitive to different colors and when used under the \"wrong\" light source, every layer may not respond proportionally, giving odd color casts in the shadows, although the mid-tones may have been correctly white-balanced under the enlarger.  Light sources with discontinuous spectra, such as fluorescent tubes, cannot be fully corrected in printing either, since one of the layers may barely have recorded an image at all.\n\nPhotographic film is made for specific light sources (most commonly daylight film and [[tungsten film]]), and, used properly, will create a neutral color print. Matching the [[sensitometry|sensitivity of the film]] to the color temperature of the light source is one way to balance color. If tungsten film is used indoors with incandescent lamps, the yellowish-orange light of the [[tungsten]] incandescent lamps will appear as white (3200&nbsp;K) in the photograph.  Color negative film is almost always daylight-balanced, since it is assumed that color can be adjusted in printing (with limitations, see above).  Color transparency film, being the final artefact in the process, has to be matched to the light source or filters must be used to correct color.\n\n[[filter (photography)|Filters]] on a camera lens, or [[color gel]]s over the light source(s) may be used to correct color balance. When shooting with a bluish light (high color temperature) source such as on an overcast day, in the shade, in window light, or if using tungsten film with white or blue light, a yellowish-orange filter will correct this. For shooting with daylight film (calibrated to 5600&nbsp;K) under warmer (low color temperature) light sources such as sunsets, candlelight or [[tungsten lighting]], a bluish (e.g. #80A) filter may be used. More-subtle filters are needed to correct for the difference between, say 3200&nbsp;K and 3400&nbsp;K tungsten lamps or to correct for the slightly blue cast of some flash tubes, which may be 6000&nbsp;K. <ref>Strobist 101 and 102:  http://strobist.blogspot.com/2008/04/lighting-102-61-gelling-for-fluorescent.html</ref> <ref>Strobist: http://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/03/lighting-101-using-gels-to-correct.html</ref>\n\nIf there is more than one light source with varied color temperatures, one way to balance the color is to use daylight film and place color-correcting gel filters over each light source.\n\nPhotographers sometimes use color temperature meters. These are usually designed to read only two regions along the visible spectrum (red and blue); more expensive ones read three regions (red, green, and blue). However, they are ineffective with sources such as fluorescent or discharge lamps, whose light varies in color and may be harder to correct for. Because this light is often greenish, a magenta filter may correct it. More sophisticated [[colorimetry]] tools can be used if such meters are lacking.\n\n===Desktop publishing===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nIn the desktop publishing industry, it is important to know a monitor\u2019s color temperature. Color matching software, such as Apple's [[ColorSync]] for Mac OS, measures a monitor's color temperature and then adjusts its settings accordingly. This enables on-screen color to more closely match printed color. Common monitor color temperatures, along with matching [[standard illuminant]]s in parentheses, are as follows:\n*5000&nbsp;K (D50)\n*5500&nbsp;K (D55)\n*6500&nbsp;K ([[CIE Standard Illuminant D65|D65]])\n*7500&nbsp;K (D75)\n*9300&nbsp;K\n\nD50 is scientific shorthand for a [[standard illuminant]]: the daylight spectrum at a correlated color temperature of 5000&nbsp;K. Similar definitions exist for D55, D65 and D75. Designations such as ''D50'' are used to help classify color temperatures of [[light table]]s and viewing booths. When viewing a [[Reversal film|color slide]] at a light table, it is important that the light be balanced properly so that the colors are not shifted towards the red or blue.\n\n[[Digital camera]]s, web graphics, [[DVD]]s, etc., are normally designed for a 6500&nbsp;K color temperature. The [[sRGB color space|sRGB standard]] commonly used for images on the Internet stipulates (among other things) a 6500&nbsp;K display [[white point]].\n\n===TV, video, and digital still cameras===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nThe [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] TV norms call for a compliant TV screen to display an electrically black and white signal (minimal color saturation) at a color temperature of 6500&nbsp;K. On many consumer-grade televisions, there is a very noticeable deviation from this requirement. However, higher-end consumer-grade televisions can have their color temperatures adjusted to 6500&nbsp;K by using a preprogrammed setting or a custom calibration. Current versions of [[ATSC (standards)|ATSC]] explicitly call for the color temperature data to be included in the data stream, but old versions of ATSC allowed this data to be omitted. In this case, current versions of ATSC cite default colorimetry standards depending on the format. Both of the cited standards specify a 6500&nbsp;K color temperature.\n\nMost video and digital still cameras can adjust for color temperature by zooming into a white or neutral colored object and setting the manual \"white balance\" (telling the camera that \"this object is white\"); the camera then shows true white as white and adjusts all the other colors accordingly. White-balancing is necessary especially when indoors under fluorescent lighting and when moving the camera from one lighting situation to another. Most cameras also have an automatic white balance function that attempts to determine the color of the light and correct accordingly. While these settings were once unreliable, they are much improved in today's digital cameras and produce an accurate white balance in a wide variety of lighting situations.\n\n===Artistic application via control of color temperature===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\n[[File:Example different color temp.jpg|right|thumb|180px|The house above appears a light cream during midday, but seems to be bluish white here in the dim light before full sunrise. Note the color temperature of the sunrise in the background.]]\n\nVideo [[camera operator]]s can white-balance objects that are not white, downplaying the color of the object used for white-balancing. For instance, they can bring more warmth into a picture by white-balancing off something that is light blue, such as faded blue denim; in this way white-balancing can replace a filter or lighting gel when those are not available.\n\n[[Cinematographer]]s do not \u201cwhite balance\u201d in the same way as video camera operators; they use techniques such as filters, choice of film stock, [[pre-flashing]], and, after shooting, [[color grading]], both by exposure at the labs and also digitally. Cinematographers also work closely with set designers and lighting crews to achieve the desired color effects.\n\nFor artists, most pigments and papers have a cool or warm cast, as the human eye can detect even a minute amount of saturation. Gray mixed with yellow, orange, or red is a \u201cwarm gray\u201d. Green, blue, or purple create \u201ccool grays\u201d. Note that this sense of temperature is the reverse of that of real temperature; bluer is described as \u201ccooler\u201d even though it corresponds to a higher-temperature [[black body]].\n\n{| style=\"border:1px solid #aaaaaa; background-color:white; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px; float: left; margin-left: 10px\"\n|- align=center\n|colspan=2|[[Image:grays.svg|240px]]\n|- align=center\n||'''\"Warm\" gray'''\n||'''\"Cool\" gray'''\n|- align=center\n||Mixed with 6% yellow.\n||Mixed with 6% blue.\n|}\n\n[[Lighting designers]] sometimes select [[filter (optics)|filter]]s by color temperature, commonly to match light that is theoretically white. Since fixtures using [[Metal halide lamp|discharge]] type lamps produce a light of a considerably higher color temperature than do [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten lamps]], using the two in conjunction could potentially produce a stark contrast, so sometimes fixtures with [[High-intensity discharge lamp|HID lamps]], commonly producing light of 6000\u20137000&nbsp;K, are fitted with 3200&nbsp;K filters to emulate tungsten light. Fixtures with color mixing features or with multiple colors, (if including 3200&nbsp;K) are also capable of producing tungsten-like light. Color temperature may also be a factor when selecting [[Electric light|lamps]], since each is likely to have a different color temperature.<ref>[http://www.highend.com/support/training/colortemp.asp Color Temperature and Metal Halide Sources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421143458/http://www.highend.com/support/training/colortemp.asp |date=2008-04-21 }}</ref>\n<div style=\"clear: both;\"></div>\n\n==Correlated color temperature==<!-- This section is linked from [[Color temperature]] -->\n[[File:Blackbody_peak_wavelength_exitance_vs_temperature.svg|thumb|250px|Log-log graphs of [[Wien's_displacement_law|peak emission wavelength]] and [[radiant exitance]] vs [[black-body]] temperature &ndash; red arrows show that [[photosphere|5780 K]] black bodies have 501 nm peak wavelength and 63.3 MW/m&#178; radiant exitance]]\n{{quote|The '''correlated color temperature''' (CCT, T<sub>cp</sub>) is the temperature of the Planckian radiator whose perceived color most closely resembles that of a given stimulus at the same brightness and under specified viewing conditions| [http://www.cie.co.at/publ/abst/17-4-89.html CIE/IEC 17.4:1987]|International Lighting Vocabulary ({{ISBN|3900734070}})<ref>{{cite journal|title=The concept of correlated colour temperature revisited|first=\u00c1kos|last=Borb\u00e9ly|volume=26|issue=6|pages=450\u2013457|date=December 2001|doi=10.1002/col.1065|journal=Color Research & Application|url=http://www.knt.vein.hu/staff/schandaj/SJCV-Publ-2005/462.doc|last2=S\u00e1mson|first2=\u00c1rp\u00e1d|last3=Schanda|first3=J\u00e1nos|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205040121/http://www.knt.vein.hu/staff/schandaj/SJCV-Publ-2005/462.doc|archivedate=2009-02-05|df=}}</ref>}}\n\n===Motivation===\n[[Black-body]] radiators are the reference by which the whiteness of light sources is judged. A black body can be described by its color temperature, whose hues are depicted above. By analogy, nearly Planckian light sources such as certain [[fluorescent lamp|fluorescent]] or [[high-intensity discharge lamp]]s can be judged by their correlated color temperature (CCT), the color temperature of the Planckian radiator that best approximates them. For light source spectra that are not Planckian, color temperature is not a well defined attribute; the concept of correlated color temperature was developed to map such sources as well as possible onto the one-dimensional scale of color temperature, where \"as well as possible\" is defined in the context of an objective color space.\n\n===Background===\n[[File:Judd's (r,g) diagram.svg|thumb|200px|Judd's (r,g) diagram.

Bridging the concepts of color difference and color temperature, Priest made the observation that the eye is sensitive to constant differences in \"reciprocal\" temperature:<ref>{{cite journal|title=A proposed scale for use in specifying the chromaticity of incandescent illuminants and various phases of daylight|first=Irwin G.|last=Priest|date=February 1933|journal=[[JOSA]]|volume=23|issue=2|url=http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=josa-23-2-41|pages=42|doi=10.1364/JOSA.23.000041}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|A difference of one [[mired|micro-reciprocal-degree]] (\u03bcrd) is fairly representative of the doubtfully perceptible difference under the most favorable conditions of observation.}}\n\nPriest proposed to use \"the scale of temperature as a scale for arranging the chromaticities of the several illuminants in a serial order\".

The original title for these drawings was ''Mr Punch's face is the letter Q'' and the new title \"cartoon\" was intended to be ironic, a reference to the self-aggrandizing posturing of Westminster politicians.\n\nCartoons can be divided into gag cartoons, which include editorial cartoons, and comic strips.\n\nModern single-panel [[gag cartoon|''gag cartoons'']], found in magazines, generally consist of a single drawing with a typeset caption positioned beneath, or\u2014less often\u2014a [[speech balloon]].{{sfn|Bishop|2009|p=92}} Newspaper syndicates have also distributed single-panel gag cartoons by [[Mel Calman]], [[Bill Holman (cartoonist)|Bill Holman]], [[Gary Larson]], [[George Lichty]], [[Fred Neher]] and others. Many consider ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' cartoonist [[Peter Arno]] the father of the modern gag cartoon (as did Arno himself).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maslin |first1=Michael |title=The Peter Arno Cartoons That Help Rescue The New Yorker |url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-peter-arno-cartoons-that-helped-rescue-the-new-yorker |publisher=The New Yorker |accessdate=2018-09-16 |date=May 5, 2016}}</ref> The roster of magazine gag cartoonists includes [[Charles Addams]], [[Charles Barsotti]], and [[Chon Day]].\n\n[[Bill Hoest]], [[Jerry Marcus]], and [[Virgil Partch]] began as magazine gag cartoonists and moved to syndicated [[comic strips]]. [[Richard Thompson (cartoonist)|Richard Thompson]] is noteworthy in the area of newspaper cartoon illustration; he illustrated numerous feature articles in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' before creating his ''[[Cul de Sac (comic strip)|Cul de Sac]]'' comic strip. The sports section of newspapers usually featured cartoons, sometimes including syndicated features such as Chester \"Chet\" Brown's ''[[All in Sport]]''.\n\n''[[Editorial cartoons]]'' are found almost exclusively in news publications and news websites. Although they also employ humor, they are more serious in tone, commonly using [[irony]] or [[satire]]. The art usually acts as a visual metaphor to illustrate a point of view on current social or political topics. Editorial cartoons often include speech balloons and sometimes use multiple panels. [[Editorial cartoonist]]s of note include [[Herblock]], [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], [[Jeff MacNelly]], [[Mike Peters (cartoonist)|Mike Peters]], and [[Gerald Scarfe]].<ref name=Becker/>\n\n''Comic strips'', also known as ''cartoon strips'' in the United Kingdom, are found daily in newspapers worldwide, and are usually a short series of cartoon illustrations in sequence. In the United States, they are not commonly called \"cartoons\" themselves, but rather \"comics\" or \"[[Sunday comics|funnies]]\". Nonetheless, the creators of comic strips\u2014as well as [[comic book]]s and [[graphic novel]]s\u2014are usually referred to as \"[[cartoonist]]s\". Although humor is the most prevalent subject matter, adventure and drama are also represented in this medium. Some noteworthy cartoonists of humorous comic strips are [[Scott Adams]], [[Steve Bell (cartoonist)|Steve Bell]], [[Charles Schulz]], [[E. C. Segar]], [[Mort Walker]] and [[Bill Watterson]].<ref name=Becker/>\n\n===Political cartoons===\n{{main article|Editorial cartoon}}\n\nPolitical cartoons are like illustrated editorial that serve visual commentaries on political events. They offer subtle criticism which are cleverly quoted with humour and satire to the extent that the criticized does not get embitered.\n\nThe pictorial satire of [[William Hogarth]] is regarded as a precursor to the development of political cartoons in 18th century England.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}} [[George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend|George Townshend]] produced some of the first overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.{{sfn|Press|1981|page=34}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Birth+of+England%27s+pocket+cartoon%3B+LOCAL+HISTORY+Smile+awhile+through...-a0153110971| title=Birth of England's pocket cartoon|author=Chris Upton|publisher=The Free Library}}</ref> The medium began to develop in the latter part of the 18th century under the direction of its great exponents, [[James Gillray]] and [[Thomas Rowlandson]], both from London. Gillray explored the use of the medium for lampooning and [[caricature]], and has been referred to as the father of the political cartoon.{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} By calling the king, prime ministers and generals to account for their behaviour, many of Gillray's satires were directed against [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], depicting him as a pretentious buffoon, while the bulk of his work was dedicated to ridiculing the ambitions of [[revolutionary France]] and [[Napoleon]].{{sfn|Rowson|2015}} [[George Cruikshank]] became the leading cartoonist in the period following Gillray, from 1815 until the 1840s. His career was renowned for his social caricatures of English life for popular publications.\n\n[[File:Tammany Ring, Nast crop.jpg|thumb|250px|Nast depicts the [[Tweed Ring]]: \"Who stole the people's money?\" / \"'Twas him.\"|alt=A cartoon showing a circle of men pointing their fingers at the man to their right with grimaces on their faces.]]\n\nBy the mid 19th century, major political newspapers in many other countries featured cartoons commenting on the politics of the day. [[Thomas Nast]], in New York City, showed how realistic German drawing techniques could redefine American cartooning.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|p=24}} His 160 cartoons relentlessly pursued the criminal characteristic of the [[William M. Tweed|Tweed machine]] in New York City, and helped bring it down. Indeed, Tweed was arrested in Spain when police identified him from Nast's cartoons.{{sfn|Adler|Hill|2008|pp=49\u201350}} Sir [[John Tenniel]] was the toast of London.{{sfn|Morris|Tenniel|2005|p=344}}\n\nPolitical cartoons can be humorous or satirical, sometimes with piercing effect. The target of the humor may complain, but they can seldom fight back. Lawsuits have been very rare; the first successful lawsuit against a cartoonist in over a century in Britain came in 1921, when [[J. H. Thomas]], the leader of the [[National Union of Railwaymen]] (NUR), initiated libel proceedings against the magazine of the [[British Communist Party]]. Thomas claimed defamation in the form of cartoons and words depicting the events of \"Black Friday\", when he allegedly betrayed the locked-out [[Miners' Federation of Great Britain|Miners' Federation]]. To Thomas, the framing of his image by the far left threatened to grievously degrade his character in the popular imagination. Soviet-inspired communism was a new element in European politics, and cartoonists unrestrained by tradition tested the boundaries of libel law. Thomas won the lawsuit and restored his reputation.<ref>Samuel S.  Hyde, \"'Please, Sir, he called me \u201cJimmy!' Political Cartooning before the Law: 'Black Friday,' J.H. Thomas, and the Communist Libel Trial of 1921,\" ''Contemporary British History'' (2011) 25#4 pp 521-550</ref>\n\n===Scientific cartoons===\nCartoons such as ''[[xkcd]]'' have also found their place in the world of [[science]], [[mathematics]], and [[technology]]. Cartoons related to [[chemistry]] are, for example, the ''Wonderlab'', which looked at daily life in the lab.  In the U.S., one well-known cartoonist for these fields is [[Sidney Harris (cartoonist)|Sidney Harris]]. Not all, but many of [[Gary Larson]]'s cartoons have a scientific flavor.\n\n===Comic books<!--'Humor comics' and 'Humour comics' redirect here-->===\n{{Main|Comic book}}\n \nBooks with cartoons are usually magazine-format \"comic books,\" or occasionally [[Comics collection|reprints of newspaper cartoons]].\n\nIn Britain in the 1930s adventure magazines became quite popular, especially those published by [[DC Thomson]]; the publisher sent observers around the country to talk to boys and learn what they wanted to read about. The story line in magazines, comic books and cinema that most appealed to boys was the glamorous heroism of British soldiers fighting wars that were exciting and just.<ref>[[Ernest Sackville Turner]], ''Boys Will Be Boys: The Story of Sweeney Todd, Deadwood Dick, Sexton Blake, Billy Bunter, Dick Barton et al.'' (3rd ed. 1975).</ref>  D.C. Thomson issued the first [[The Dandy|''The Dandy Comic'']] in December 1937. It had a revolutionary design that broke away from the usual children's comics that were published broadsheet in size and not very colourful.  Thomson capitalized on its success with a similar product ''[[The Beano]]''  in 1938.<ref>{{cite book|author=M. Keith Booker|title=Comics through Time: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas &#91;4 volumes&#93;: A History of Icons, Idols, and Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hnuQBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA74|year=2014|page=74}}</ref>\n\nOn some occasions, new gag cartoons have been created for book publication, as was the case with ''[[Think Small]]'', a 1967 promotional book distributed as a giveaway by [[Volkswagen]] dealers. [[Bill Hoest]] and other cartoonists of that decade drew cartoons showing Volkswagens, and these were published along with humorous automotive essays by such humorists as [[H. Allen Smith]], [[Roger Price (comedy)|Roger Price]] and [[Jean Shepherd]]. The book's design juxtaposed each cartoon alongside a photograph of the cartoon's creator.\n\n==Animation==\n[[File:Animhorse.gif|thumb|200px|An [[animated cartoon]] horse, drawn by [[rotoscoping]] from [[Eadweard Muybridge]]'s 19th-century photos|alt=a running horse (animated)]]\n{{Main article|Animated cartoon}}\nBecause of the stylistic similarities between comic strips and early animated movies, ''cartoon'' came to refer to [[animation]], and the word ''cartoon'' is currently used in reference to both animated cartoons and gag cartoons.{{sfn|Walasek|2009|p=116}}  While ''animation'' designates any style of illustrated images seen in rapid succession to give the impression of movement, the word \"cartoon\" is most often used as a descriptor for television programs and short films aimed at children, possibly featuring [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] animals,{{sfn|Wells|2008|p=41}} [[superhero]]es, the adventures of child protagonists or related themes.\n\nIn the 1980s, ''cartoon'' was shortened to ''toon'', referring to characters in animated productions. This term was popularized in 1988 by the combined live-action/animated film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'', followed in 1990 by the animated TV series ''[[Tiny Toon Adventures]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Cartoon|Comics|Arts|Visual arts|Film}}\n*[[Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum]]\n*[[Caricature]]\n*[[Comics]]\n*[[Comics studies]]\n*[[Editorial cartoon]]\n*''[[Histoire de M.

The office is the equivalent of a [[Premiers of the Australian states|State Premier]].  \nWhen the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] was created in 1974, the head of government was officially known as '''Majority Leader'''. This title was used in the first parliament (1974\u20131977) and the first eighteen months of the second. When self-government was granted the Northern Territory in 1978, the title of the head of government became Chief Minister.\n\nThe Chief Minister is formally appointed by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory of Australia|Administrator]], who in normal circumstances will appoint the head of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] Legislative Assembly. In times of constitutional crisis, the Administrator can appoint someone else as Chief Minister, however, this has never occurred.\n\nSince 31 August, following the [[Northern Territory general election, 2016|2016 election]], the Chief Minister is [[Michael Gunner]] of the [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Labor Party]].

At the [[Northern Territory general election, 1977|1977 election]] Letts lost his seat and party leadership. He was succeeded on 13 August 1977 by [[Paul Everingham]] (CLP) as Majority Leader. When the Territory attained self-government on 1 July 1978, Everingham became Chief Minister with greatly expanded powers.\n\nIn 2001, [[Clare Martin]] became the first Labor and female Chief Minister of the Northern Territory.

Chemotherapy may be given with a [[cure|curative]] intent (which almost always involves combinations of drugs), or it may aim to prolong life or to [[Palliative care|reduce symptoms]] (palliative chemotherapy). Chemotherapy is one of the major categories of the medical discipline specifically devoted to [[pharmacotherapy]] for [[cancer]], which is called [[oncology#Specialties|''medical oncology'']].\n\nThe term ''chemotherapy'' has come to connote non-specific usage of intracellular [[poison]]s to inhibit [[mitosis]], cell division. The connotation excludes more selective agents that block extracellular signals ([[signal transduction]]). The development of therapies with specific molecular or genetic targets, which inhibit growth-promoting signals from classic endocrine hormones (primarily [[estrogen]]s for breast cancer and [[androgen]]s for prostate cancer) are now called [[hormonal therapy (oncology)|hormonal therapies]]. By contrast, other inhibitions of growth-signals like those associated with [[receptor tyrosine kinase]]s are referred to as [[targeted therapy]].\n\nImportantly, the use of drugs (whether chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or targeted therapy) constitutes ''systemic therapy'' for cancer in that they are introduced into the blood stream and are therefore in principle able to address cancer at any anatomic location in the body. Systemic therapy is often used in conjunction with other modalities that constitute ''local therapy'' (i.e. treatments whose efficacy is confined to the anatomic area where they are applied) for cancer such as [[radiation therapy]], [[surgery]] or [[hyperthermia therapy]].\n\nTraditional chemotherapeutic agents are [[cytotoxicity|cytotoxic]] by means of interfering with cell division (mitosis) but cancer cells vary widely in their susceptibility to these agents. To a large extent, chemotherapy can be thought of as a way to damage or stress cells, which may then lead to cell death if [[apoptosis]] is initiated. Many of the side effects of chemotherapy can be traced to damage to normal cells that divide rapidly and are thus sensitive to anti-mitotic drugs: cells in the [[bone marrow]], [[digestive tract]] and [[hair follicle]]s. This results in the most common side-effects of chemotherapy: [[myelosuppression]] (decreased production of blood cells, hence also [[immunosuppression]]), [[mucositis]] (inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract), and [[alopecia]] (hair loss). Because of the effect on immune cells (especially lymphocytes), chemotherapy drugs often find use in a host of diseases that result from harmful overactivity of the immune system against self (so-called [[autoimmunity]]). These include [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], [[multiple sclerosis]], [[vasculitis]] and many others.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Treatment strategies ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right;\"\n|+ Common combination [[chemotherapy regimen]]s<ref name=Corrie />\n! scope=\"col\" | Cancer type\n! scope=\"col\" | Drugs\n! scope=\"col\" | Acronym\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Breast cancer]]\n| [[Cyclophosphamide]], [[methotrexate]], [[5-fluorouracil]], [[vinorelbine]]  || CMF\n|-\n| [[Doxorubicin]], [[cyclophosphamide]]|| AC\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"3\" |[[Hodgkin's lymphoma]]\n| [[Docetaxel]], [[doxorubicin]], [[cyclophosphamide]]\n|TAC\n|-\n|[[Doxorubicin]], [[bleomycin]], [[vinblastine]], [[dacarbazine]]\n|ABVD\n|-\n|[[Chlormethine|Mustine]], [[vincristine]], [[procarbazine]], [[prednisolone]]\n|MOPP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]]\n|[[Cyclophosphamide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[vincristine]], [[prednisolone]]|| CHOP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Germ cell tumor]]\n|[[Bleomycin]], [[etoposide]], [[cisplatin]]|| BEP\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |[[Stomach cancer]]<ref name=CochraneGastric2017>{{cite journal|last1=Wagner|first1=Anna Dorothea|last2=Syn|first2=Nicholas LX|last3=Moehler|first3=Markus|last4=Grothe|first4=Wilfried|last5=Yong|first5=Wei Peng|last6=Tai|first6=Bee-Choo|last7=Ho|first7=Jingshan|last8=Unverzagt|first8=Susanne|title=Chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=29 August 2017|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd004064.pub4|pmid=28850174|volume=8|page=CD004064}}</ref>\n| [[Epirubicin]], [[cisplatin]], [[Fluorouracil|5-fluorouracil]]|| ECF\n|-\n|[[Epirubicin]], [[cisplatin]], [[capecitabine]]|| ECX\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Bladder cancer]]\n| [[Methotrexate]], [[vincristine]], [[doxorubicin]], [[cisplatin]]|| MVAC\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Lung cancer]]\n| [[Cyclophosphamide]], [[doxorubicin]], [[vincristine]], [[vinorelbine]]|| CAV\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Colorectal cancer]]\n| [[5-fluorouracil]], [[folinic acid]], [[oxaliplatin]] || FOLFOX\n|-\n|}\n\nThere are a number of strategies in the administration of chemotherapeutic drugs used today.

Unlike alkylating agents, anti-metabolites are cell cycle dependent. This means that they only work during a specific part of the cell cycle, in this case [[S-phase]] (the DNA synthesis phase). For this reason, at a certain dose, the effect plateaus and proportionally no more cell death occurs with increased doses.

When the DNA double-strand helix is unwound, during DNA replication or [[transcription (biology)|transcription]], for example, the adjacent unopened DNA winds tighter (supercoils), like opening the middle of a twisted rope. The stress caused by this effect is in part aided by the topoisomerase enzymes. They produce single- or double-strand breaks into DNA, reducing the tension in the DNA strand. This allows the normal unwinding of DNA to occur during [[DNA replication|replication]] or transcription. Inhibition of topoisomerase I or II interferes with both of these processes.<ref>{{cite book | name-list-format = vanc |vauthors=Lodish H, Berk A, Zipursky SL |title=Molecular Cell Biology. 4th edition.

This overcomes the effect of drugs that reduce the expression of genes involved in replication. With more copies of the gene, the drug can not prevent all expression of the gene and therefore the cell can restore its proliferative ability. Cancer cells can also cause defects in the cellular pathways of [[apoptosis]] (programmed cell death). As most chemotherapy drugs kill cancer cells in this manner, defective apoptosis allows survival of these cells, making them resistant. Many chemotherapy drugs also cause DNA damage, which can be repaired by [[enzyme]]s in the cell that carry out [[DNA repair]]. Upregulation of these genes can overcome the DNA damage and prevent the induction of apoptosis.

They are divided into two groups: small molecule and antibodies. The massive toxicity seen with the use of cytotoxics is due to the lack of cell specificity of the drugs. They will kill any rapidly dividing cell, tumor or normal. Targeted therapies are designed to affect cellular proteins or processes that are utilised by the cancer cells. This allows a high dose to cancer tissues with a relatively low dose to other tissues. Although the [[adverse effects|side effects]] are often less severe than that seen of cytotoxic chemotherapeutics, life-threatening effects can occur. Initially, the targeted therapeutics were supposed to be solely selective for one protein. Now it is clear that there is often a range of protein targets that the drug can bind. An example target for targeted therapy is the protein produced by the [[Philadelphia chromosome]], a genetic lesion found commonly in [[chronic myelomonocytic leukemia]]. This fusion protein has enzyme activity that can be inhibited by [[imatinib]], a [[small molecule]] drug.<ref name=\"pmid18297955\">{{cite journal | author = Gerber DE | title = Targeted therapies: a new generation of cancer treatments | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 77 | issue = 3 | pages = 311\u20139 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18297955 | doi =  }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid12360278\">{{cite journal | author = Allen TM | title = Ligand-targeted therapeutics in anticancer therapy | journal = Nature Reviews.

The [[Spring and Autumn Annals|''Chunqiu (Spring and Autumn Annals'', \u6625\u79cb)]], the official chronicle of the [[State of Lu]], cover the period from 722 to 481 BC, and are among the earliest surviving Chinese historical texts to be arranged as [[annal]]s. The compilations of both of these works are traditionally ascribed to [[Confucius]]. The [[Zuo Zhuan|''Zuo Zhuan'' (\u5de6\u50b3)]], attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the 5th century BC, is the earliest Chinese work of narrative history and covers the period from 722 to 468 BC. The anonymous [[Zhan Guo Ce|''Zhan Guo Ce'' (\u6230\u570b\u7b56)]] was a renowned ancient Chinese historical work composed of sporadic materials on the [[Warring States period]] between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC.\n\nThe first systematic Chinese historical text, the [[Records of the Grand Historian|''Shiji'' (''Records of the Grand Historian'', \u53f2\u8a18)]], was written by [[Sima Qian]] (c.{{nbsp}}145 or 135\u201386{{nbsp}}BC) based on work by his father, [[Sima Tan]]. It covers the period from the time of the [[Yellow Emperor]] until the author's own lifetime. Because of this highly praised and frequently copied work, Sima Qian is often regarded as the father of Chinese [[historiography]]. The [[Twenty-Four Histories|''Twenty-Four Histories'' (\u4e8c\u5341\u56db\u53f2)]], the official histories of the dynasties considered legitimate by imperial Chinese historians, all copied Sima Qian's format. Typically, rulers initiating a new dynasty would employ scholars to compile a final history from the annals and records of the previous one.\n\nThe [[Shitong|''Shitong'' (\u53f2\u901a)]] was the first Chinese work about historiography. It was compiled by [[Liu Zhiji]] between 708 and 710 AD. The book describes the general pattern of the official dynastic histories with regard to the structure, method, arrangement, sequence, caption, and commentary dating back to the [[Warring States period]].\n\nThe [[Zizhi Tongjian|''Zizhi Tongjian'' (\u8cc7\u6cbb\u901a\u9451)]] was a pioneering reference work of Chinese historiography. [[Emperor Yingzong of Song]] ordered [[Sima Guang]] and other scholars to begin compiling this universal history of China in 1065, and they presented it to his successor [[Emperor Shenzong of Song|Shenzong]] in 1084. It contains 294 volumes and about three million characters, and it narrates the history of China from 403 BC to the beginning of the [[Song dynasty]] in 959. This style broke the nearly thousand-year tradition of Sima Qian, which employed annals for imperial reigns but biographies or treatises for other topics. The more consistent style of the ''Zizhi Tongjian'' was not followed by later official histories. In the mid 13th century, [[Ouyang Xiu]] was heavily influenced by the work of [[Xue Juzheng]]. This led to the creation of the [[New History of the Five Dynasties|''Xin Wudai Shi (New History of the Five Dynasties'', \u65b0\u4e94\u4ee3\u53f2)]], which covered five dynasties in over 70 chapters.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11380/ |title=History of the Five Dynasties |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1280\u20131368 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref>\n\nToward the end of the [[Qing dynasty]] in the early 20th century, scholars looked to Japan and the West for models. In the late 1890s, although deeply learned in the traditional forms, [[Liang Qichao]] began to publish extensive and influential studies and [[polemic]]s that converted young readers to a new type of historiography that Liang regarded as more scientific. [[Liu Yizheng]] published several specilized history works including ''History of Chinese Culture''. This next generation became professional historians, training and teaching in universities. They included [[Chang Chi-yun]], <!--? [[Hu Shi]] (not professional historian. He taught philosophy\uff0cEnglish, literature, etc.) ,--> [[Gu Jiegang]], [[Fu Sinian]], and [[Tsiang Tingfu]], who were PhDs from [[Columbia University]]; and [[Chen Yinke]], who conducted his investigations into medieval Chinese history in both Europe and the United States. Other historians, such as [[Qian Mu]], who was trained largely through independent study, were more conservative but remained innovative in their response to world trends.<ref>Laurence A. Schneider, ''Ku Chieh-Kang and China's New History; Nationalism and the Quest for Alternative Traditions'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1971), ''passim''</ref> In the 1920s, wide-ranging scholars, such as [[Guo Moruo]], adapted Marxism in order to portray China as a nation among nations, rather than having an exotic and isolated history. The ensuing years saw historians such as [[Wu Han (historian)|Wu Han]] master both Western theories, including Marxism, and Chinese learning.<ref>Mary Gale Mazur, ''Wu Han, Historian: Son of China's Times'' (Lanham: Lexington Books, 2009)</ref>\n\n==Key organizing concepts==\n\n===Dynastic cycle===\nLike the [[Three-age system#The Metallic Ages of Hesiod|three ages]] of the Greek poet [[Hesiod]], the oldest Chinese historiography viewed mankind as living in a fallen age of depravity, cut off from the virtues of the past, as [[Confucius]] and his disciples revered the [[sage king]]s [[Emperor Yao]] and [[Emperor Shun]].\n\nUnlike Hesiod's system, however, the [[Duke of Zhou]]'s idea of the [[Mandate of Heaven]] as a rationale for dethroning the supposedly divine [[Zi (surname)|Zi]] clan led subsequent historians to see man's fall as a [[dynastic cycle|cyclical pattern]]. In this view, a new dynasty is founded by a morally upright founder, but his successors cannot help but become increasingly corrupt and dissolute. This immorality removes the dynasty\u2019s divine favor and is manifested by natural disasters (particularly [[Yellow River|floods]]), rebellions, and foreign invasions. Eventually, the dynasty becomes weak enough to be replaced by a new one, whose founder is able to [[rectification of names|rectify]] many of society\u2019s problems and begin the cycle anew. Over time, many people felt a full correction was not possible, and that the [[golden age]] of Yao and Shun could not be attained.\n\nThis [[teleology|teleological]] theory implies that there can be only one rightful sovereign [[all under heaven|under heaven]] at a time. Thus, despite the fact that Chinese history has had many lengthy and contentious periods of disunity, a great effort was made by official historians to establish a legitimate precursor whose fall allowed a new dynasty to acquire its mandate. Similarly, regardless of the particular merits of individual emperors, founders would be portrayed in more laudatory terms, and the last ruler of a dynasty would always be castigated as depraved and unworthy, even when that was not the case. Such a narrative was employed after the fall of the empire, by those compiling the history of the Qing and by those who justified the attempted restorations of the imperial system by [[Yuan Shikai]] and [[Zhang Xun (Qing loyalist)|Zhang Xun]].\n\n===Multi-ethnic history===\nAs early as the 1930s, the American scholar [[Owen Lattimore]] argued that China was the product of the interaction of farming and pastoral societies, rather than simply the expansion of the Han Chinese people. Lattimore did not accept the more extreme [[Sino-Babylonianism|Sino-Babylonian]] theories that the essential elements of early Chinese technology and religion had come from Western Asia, but he was among the scholars to argue against the assumption they had all been indigenous.{{sfnb|Cotton|1989| p = passim}} \n\n[[Republic of China|Nationalist]] and Communist China both held the view that Chinese history should include all the ethnic groups of the lands held by the [[Qing Empire]] ([[Zhonghua Minzu]]), and not just the history of the [[Han Chinese]] in so-called [[China Proper]], the [[Han chauvinism]] of the Qing-era [[Tongmenghui]]. This expanded view encompassed internal and external tributary lands and [[conquest dynasties]] in the history of a China seen as a coherent multi-ethnic nation from time immemorial, incorporating the contributions of non-Han to Chinese history, including dynasties once considered foreign, such as the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and the Manchu [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], as well as the Khitan [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] and Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin]] dynasties.\n\nThe acceptance of this view by ethnic minorities sometimes depends on their views on present-day issues. The [[14th Dalai Lama]], long insistent on Tibet's history being separate from that of China, conceded in 2005 that Tibet \"is a part of\" China's \"5,000-year history\" as part of a new proposal for Tibetan autonomy.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Tibet-part-of-China-Dalai-Lama-agrees/2005/03/14/1110649129309.html |title=Tibet part of China, Dalai Lama agrees |first=Hamish |last=McDonald |date=2005-03-15 |accessdate=2010-11-05 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}</ref> [[Korean nationalism|Korean nationalists]] have virulently reacted against China's application to [[UNESCO]] for recognition of the [[Goguryeo tombs]] in Chinese territory.

The compilation of official histories usually involved monumental intellectual labor. The Yuan and Qing Dynasties, which might be thought foreign, faithfully carried out this practice, writing the official Chinese-language histories of the Han-ruled Song and Ming Dynasties, respectively. Had these two non-Han imperial families not thought of themselves as continuing the Mandate of Heaven of the Middle Kingdom, it would be hard to explain why they retained the costly tradition. Thus, every non-Han dynasty saw itself as the legitimate holder of the Mandate of Heaven, which legitimized the dynastic cycle regardless of social or ethnic background.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nRecent Western scholars have reacted against the ethnically inclusive narrative in Communist-sponsored history, by writing [[Historical revisionism|revisionist histories]] of China that feature, according to James A.

These theories were first applied in the 1920s by Chinese scholars such as [[Guo Moruo]], and became orthodoxy in academic study after 1949. The Marxist view of history is that history is governed by universal laws and that according to these laws, a society moves through a series of stages, with the transition between stages being driven by class struggle.<ref>Arif Dirlik, \"The Universalization of a Concept: From 'Feudalism' to Feudalism in Chinese Marxist Historiography,\" ''Journal of Peasant Studies'' 12.2\u20133 (January/April 1985): 197\u2013227.</ref> These stages are:\n* Slave society\n* Feudal society\n* Capitalist society\n* Socialist society\n* The world communist society\n\nThe official historical view within the People's Republic of China associates each of these stages with a particular era in Chinese history.\n* Slave society \u2013 [[Xia dynasty|Xia]] to [[Shang dynasty|Shang]]\n* Feudal society (decentralized) \u2013 [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] to [[Sui dynasty|Sui]]\n* Feudal society (bureaucratic) \u2013 [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] to the [[First Opium War]]\n* Feudal society (semi-colonial) \u2013 First Opium War to end of [[Qing dynasty]]\n* Capitalist society \u2013 [[History of the Republic of China|Republican era]]\n* Socialist society \u2013 [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] 1949 to present\n\nBecause of the strength of the [[Communist Party of China]] and the importance of the Marxist interpretation of history in legitimizing its rule, it was for many years difficult for historians within the PRC to actively argue in favor of non-Marxist and anti-Marxist interpretations of history.  However, this political restriction is less confining than it may first appear in that the Marxist historical framework is surprisingly flexible, and it is a rather simple matter to modify an alternative historical theory to use language that at least does not challenge the Marxist interpretation of history.<ref>Albert Feuerwerker, \"China's History in Marxian Dress,\" ''The American Historical Review'' 66.2  (1961): 323\u2013353. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1844030</ref>\n\nPartly because of the interest of [[Mao Zedong]], historians in the 1950s took a special interest in the role of [[list of rebellions in China|peasant rebellions]] in Chinese history and compiled documentary histories to examine them.<ref>James P. Harrison. ''The Communists and Chinese Peasant Rebellions; a Study in the Rewriting of Chinese History''. New York: Atheneum, 1969.</ref>\n\nThere are several problems associated with imposing Marx\u2019s European-based framework on Chinese history. First, slavery existed throughout China's history but never as the primary form of labor.  While the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] and earlier dynasties may be labeled as [[feudalism|feudal]], later dynasties were much more centralized than how Marx analyzed their European counterparts as being. To account for the discrepancy, Chinese Marxists invented the term<!--pov?--> \"bureaucratic feudalism\". The placement of the Tang as the beginning of the bureaucratic phase rests largely on the replacement of [[nine-rank system|patronage networks]] with the [[imperial examination]]. Some [[World systems theory|world-systems analysts]], such as [[Janet Abu-Lughod]], claim that analysis of [[Kondratiev waves]] shows that capitalism first arose in [[Song dynasty]] China, although widespread trade was subsequently disrupted and then curtailed.\n\nThe Japanese scholar [[Tanigawa Michio]], writing in the 1970s and 1980s, set out to revise the generally Marxist views of China prevalent in post-war Japan. Tanigawa writes that historians in Japan fell into two schools. One held that China followed the set European pattern which Marxists thought to be universal; that is, from ancient slavery to medieval feudalism to modern capitalism; while another group argued that \"Chinese society was extraordinarily saturated with stagnancy, as compared to the West\" and assumed that China existed in a \"qualitatively different historical world from Western society\". That is, there is an argument between those who see \"unilinear, monistic world history\" and those who conceive of a \"two-tracked or multi-tracked world history\". Tanigawa reviewed the applications of these theories in Japanese writings about Chinese history and then tested them by analyzing the [[Six Dynasties]] 220\u2013589 CE period, which Marxist historians saw as feudal. His conclusion was that China did not have feudalism in the sense that Marxists use, that Chinese military governments did not lead to a European-style military aristocracy. The period established social and political patterns which shaped China's history from that point on.{{sfnb|Tanigawa|1985| p = [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft1k4003vg&chunk.id=d0e823&toc.depth=1&toc.id=d0e815&brand=ucpress 3]}}\n\nThere was a gradual relaxation of Marxist interpretation after the death of Mao in 1976,<ref>Kwang-Ching Liu, \"World View and Peasant Rebellion: Reflections on Post-Mao Historiography,\" ''The Journal of Asian Studies'' Vol. 40, No. 2 (Feb., 1981), pp. 295\u2013326 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2054866]</ref> which was accelerated after the [[Tiananmen Square protest of 1989|Tian'anmen Square protest]] and [[Revolutions of 1989|other revolutions]] in 1989, which damaged Marxism's ideological legitimacy in the eyes of Chinese academics.\n\n===Modernization===\nThis view of Chinese history sees Chinese society as a traditional society needing to become modern, usually with the implicit assumption of Western society as the model.<ref>A prominent example is Gilbert Rozman, ed., ''The Modernization of China'' (New York: Free Press; London: Collier Macmillan, 1981), in which a series of essays analyzes \"The Legacy of the Past\" and \"The Transformation.\"</ref> Such a view was common among British and French scholars during the 19th and early 20th centuries but is now typically dismissed as [[eurocentrism]] or even racism, since such a view permits an implicit justification for breaking the society from its static past and bringing it into the modern world under European direction.<ref>Ch. 2 \"Moving Beyond 'Tradition' and 'Modernity,'\" Paul Cohen, ''Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past'' (New York, London: Columbia University Press, 1984; 2010)</ref>\n\nBy the mid-20th century, it was increasingly clear to historians that the notion of \"changeless China\" was untenable.  A new concept, popularized by [[John Fairbank]], was the notion of \"change within tradition\", which argued that China did change in the pre-modern period but that this change existed within certain cultural traditions. This notion has also been subject to the criticism that to say \"China has not changed fundamentally\" is [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], since it requires that one look for things that have not changed and then arbitrarily define those as fundamental.\n\nNonetheless, studies seeing China's interaction with Europe as the driving force behind its recent history are still common. Such studies may consider the [[First Opium War]] as the starting point for China's modern period. Examples include the works of [[Hosea Ballou Morse|H.B. Morse]], who wrote chronicles of China's international relations such as ''Trade and Relations of the Chinese Empire''.<ref>Cohen, ''Discovering History in China''p. 102</ref>\n\nIn the 1950s, several of Fairbank's students argued that Confucianism was incompatible with modernity. [[Joseph Levenson]] and [[Mary C. Wright]], and [[Albert Feuerwerker]] argued in effect that traditional Chinese values were a barrier to modernity and would have to be abandoned before China could make progress.<ref>Cohen, ''Discovering History in China'', pp. 79\u201380.</ref> Wright concluded, \"The failure of the [[Tongzhi Restoration|T'ung-chih [''Tongzhi''] Restoration]] demonstrated with a rare clarity that even in the most favorable circumstances there is no way in which an effective modern state can be grafted onto a Confucian society. Yet in the decades that followed, the political ideas that had been tested and, for all their grandeur, found wanting, were never given a decent burial.\"<ref>Mary Clabaugh Wright. ''The Last Stand of Chinese Conservatism: The T'ung-Chih Restoration, 1862\u20131874.'' (Stanford,: Stanford University Press, 1957), 300\u201312.</ref>\n\nIn a different view of modernization, the Japanese historian [[Naito Torajiro]] argued that China reached modernity during its [[Mid-Imperial China|mid-Imperial period]], centuries before Europe. He believed that the reform of the [[scholar-bureaucrat|civil service]] into a meritocratic system and the disappearance of the ancient [[Chinese nobility]] from the bureaucracy constituted a modern society. The problem associated with this approach is the subjective meaning of modernity. The Chinese nobility had been in decline since the Qin dynasty, and while the exams were largely meritocratic, performance required time and resources that meant examinees were still typically from the [[Chinese gentry|gentry]]. Moreover, expertise in the [[Confucian classics]] did not guarantee competent bureaucrats when it came to managing public works or preparing a budget. Confucian hostility to commerce placed merchants at the bottom of the [[four occupations]], itself an archaism maintained by devotion to classic texts. The social goal continued to be to invest in land and enter the gentry, ideas more like those of the [[physiocrats]] than those of [[Adam Smith]].<ref>See, for instance, Joshua A. Fogel, ''Politics and Sinology: The Case of Nait\u014d K\u014dnan (1866\u20131934)'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts; London: Council on East Asian Studies, distributed by Harvard University Press, 1984).</ref>\n\n===Hydraulic despotism===\nWith ideas derived from Marx and [[Max Weber]], [[Karl August Wittfogel]] argued that bureaucracy arose to manage irrigation systems. Despotism was needed to force the people into building canals, dikes, and waterways to increase agriculture. [[Yu the Great]], one of China's legendary founders, is known for his control of the floods of the [[Yellow River]].  The [[hydraulic empire]] produces wealth from its stability; while dynasties may change, the structure remains intact until destroyed by modern powers. In Europe abundant rainfall meant less dependence on irrigation. In the Orient natural conditions were such that the bulk of the land could not be cultivated without large-scale irrigation works. As only a centralized administration could organize the building and maintenance of large-scale systems of irrigation, the need for such systems made [[bureaucratic despotism]] inevitable in Oriental lands.<ref name=\"Andreski1985\">{{cite book|author=Stanislav Andreski|title=The Use of Comparative Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7eW0hwZ3eZMC&pg=PA165|accessdate=16 September 2013|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|page=165|id=GGKEY:Y0TY2LKP809}}</ref>\n\nCritics of Wittfogel's theory point out that water management was given the high status China accorded to officials concerned with taxes, rituals, or fighting off bandits. The theory also has a strong [[oriental studies|orientalist]] bent, regarding all Asian states as generally the same while finding reasons for European polities not fitting the pattern.<ref>Frederick W. Mote, \"The Growth of Chinese Despotism: A Critique of Wittfogel's Theory of Oriental Despotism as Applied to China,\" ''Oriens Extremu''s 8.1  (1961):  1\u201341.</ref>\n\nWhile Wittfogel's theories were not popular among Marxist historians in China, the economist [[Ji Chaoding|Chi Ch'ao-ting]] used them in his influential 1936 book, ''[[Ji Chaoding#Key Economic Areas in Chinese History|Key Economic Areas in Chinese History, as Revealed in the Development of Public Works for Water-Control]]''. The book identified key areas of grain production which, when controlled by a strong political power, permitted that power to dominate the rest of the country and enforce periods of stability.<ref>Michael Dillon, Dictionary of Chinese History [https://books.google.com/books?id=e-BkAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA102&dq=Key+economic+areas+in+Chinese+history&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CFQQ6AEwCDgeahUKEwid3N2Kt_nGAhXLOj4KHbLrAKQ#v=onepage&q=Key%20economic%20areas%20in%20Chinese%20history&f=false p. 102]</ref>\n\n===Convergence===\nConvergence theory, including [[Hu Shih]] and [[Ray Huang]]'s involution theory, holds that the past 150 years have been a period in which Chinese and Western civilization have been in the process of converging into a world civilization. Such a view is heavily influenced by [[modernization theory]] but, in China's case, it is also strongly influenced by indigenous sources such as the notion of ''Shijie Datong'' or \"Great Unity\".  It has tended to be less popular among more recent historians, as postmodern Western historians discount overarching narratives, and nationalist Chinese historians feel similar about narratives failing to account for some special or unique characteristics of Chinese culture.\n\n===Anti-imperialism===\nClosely related are colonial and [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] narratives. These often merge or are part of Marxist critiques from within China or the former Soviet Union, or are postmodern critiques such as [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'', which fault traditional scholarship for trying to fit West, South, and East Asia's histories into European categories unsuited to them. With regard to China particularly, [[Jiang Tingfu|T.F. Tsiang]] and [[John King Fairbank|John Fairbank]] used newly opened archives in the 1930s to write modern history from a Chinese point of view. Fairbank and [[Deng Siyu|Teng Ssu-yu]] then edited the influential volume ''[[China's Response to the West]]'' (1953). This approach was attacked for ascribing the change in China to outside forces. In the 1980s, [[Paul Cohen (historian)|Paul Cohen]], a student of Fairbank's, issued a call for a more \"China-Centered history of China\".<ref>Paul Cohen, ''Discovering History in China: American Historical Writing on the Recent Chinese Past'' (New York, London:: Columbia University Press,  1984), Ch 1 \"The Problem with 'China's Response to the West,'pp. 1\u201356, and Ch 4, \"Toward a China-Centered History of China,\" pp. 149\u2013198.</ref>\n\n===Republican===\nThe schools of thought on the [[Xinhai Revolution|1911 Revolution]] have evolved from the early years of the Republic. The Marxist view saw the events of 1911 as a [[Marxism#Revolution, socialism, and communism|Bourgeois Revolution]].<ref>Winston Hsieh, ''Chinese Historiography on the Revolution of 1911 : A Critical Survey and a Selected Bibliography'' (Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University, 1975)</ref> In the 1920s, the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]] issued a theory of three political stages based on [[Sun Yatsen]]'s writings:\n* Military unification \u2013 1923 to 1928 ([[Northern Expedition (1926\u20131927)|Northern Expedition]])\n* Political tutelage \u2013 1928 to 1947\n* [[Constitution of the Republic of China|Constitutional democracy]] \u2013 1947 onward\n\nThe most obvious criticism is the near-identical nature of \"political tutelage\" and of a \"constitutional democracy\" consisting only of the one-party rule until the 1990s. Against this, [[Chen Shui-bian]] proposed his own [[Four-Stage Theory of the Republic of China|four-stage theory]].\n\n===Postmodernism===\nPostmodern interpretations of Chinese history tend to reject narrative history and instead focus on a small subset of Chinese history, particularly the daily lives of ordinary people in particular locations or settings.\n\n==Recent trends==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}\n\nFrom the beginning of Communist rule in 1949 until the 1980s, Chinese historical scholarship focused largely on peasant life interpreted via the officially sanctioned Marxist theory of class struggle. From the time of [[Deng Xiaoping]] on, there has been a drift towards a Marxist-inspired nationalist perspective, and consideration of China's contemporary international status has become of paramount importance in historical studies. The current focus tends to be on specifics of civilization in ancient China, and the general paradigm of how China has responded to the dual challenges of interactions with the outside world and modernization in the post-1700 era. Long abandoned as a research focus among most Western scholars due to postmodernism's influence, this remains the primary interest for most historians inside China.\n\nThe late 20th century and early 21st century have seen numerous studies of Chinese history that challenge traditional paradigms. The field is rapidly evolving, with much new scholarship, often based on the realization that there is much about Chinese history that is unknown or controversial. For example, an active topic concerns whether the typical Chinese peasant in 1900 was seeing his life improve. In addition to the realization that there are major gaps in our knowledge of Chinese history is the equal realization that there are tremendous quantities of primary source material that have not yet been analyzed.\n\nRecent Western scholarship of China has been heavily influenced by [[postmodernism]], and has questioned [[modernist]] narratives of China's backwardness and lack of development. The desire to challenge the preconception that 19th-century China was weak, for instance, has led to a scholarly interest in Qing expansion into Central Asia. In fact, postmodern scholarship largely rejects grand narratives altogether, preferring to publish empirical studies on the socioeconomics, and political or cultural dynamics, of smaller communities within China.\n\nScholars are attempting to assess source material more critically. For example, for a long time it was assumed that Imperial China had no system of [[Civil law (private law)|civil law]] because its law codes did not explicitly provide for civil lawsuits.  However, more recent studies, using the records of civil magistrates, suggest that a well-developed system of Chinese civil law interpreted provisions of the criminal code to allow civil causes of action. In another example, intellectuals of the mid-Qing dynasty made hostile statements about commerce; but recent studies, using sources such as magistrates' diaries and genealogical records, show that these statements should not be taken at face value, and that merchants exerted powerful influence on government policies. The division between the world of the merchant and the official was far more porous than once believed. In fact, the growing consensus is that the anti-merchant statements of the mid-Qing record a growth of merchants' power and influence rather than the opposite.\n\nScholars are also attempting to assess new and previously overlooked documentary evidence, such as masses of government and family archives, and economic records such as census tax rolls, price records, and land surveys. In addition, artifacts such as vernacular novels, how-to manuals, and children's books are analyzed for clues about day-to-day life.\n\nStill, Chinese historical scholarship remains largely [[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]]<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|last=Fitzgerald\n|first=John\n|date=1997\n|title=Review of Rescuing History from the Nation: Questioning Narratives of Modern China\n|work=The China Journal\n|volume=38\n|pages=219\u201322\n|doi=10.2307/2950363\n|jstor=2950363\n|publisher=Chicago Journals\n}}</ref> and modernist or even traditionalist.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The legacies of the modernist school (such as [[Lo Hsiang-lin]]) and the traditionalist school (such as [[Chien Mu]]) remain strong in Chinese circles. The more modernist works focus on imperial systems in China and employ the scientific method to analyze epochs of Chinese dynasties from geographical, genealogical, and cultural artifacts: for example, using Carbon-14 dating and geographical records to correlate climates with cycles of calm and calamity in Chinese history. The traditionalist school of scholarship resorts to official imperial records and colloquial historical works, and analyzes the rise and fall of different dynasties using Confucian philosophy,{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} albeit modified by an institutional administration perspective.{{clarify|date=October 2012}}\n\n==See also==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Timeline of Chinese history]]\n* [[Dynasties in Chinese history]]\n* [[Industrial Revolution in China]]\n* [[Sinology]]\n* [[Official Communications of the Chinese Empire]]\n* [[Early Imperial China]]\n* [[Mid-Imperial China]]\n* [[Late Imperial China]]\n* [[Korean nationalist historiography]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References and further reading==\n* W.

The [[Communism|Communist]] Party is the [[One-party state|sole governing party]] within [[mainland China]], [[List of political parties in the People's Republic of China|permitting only eight other]], subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the [[United Front (China)|United Front]]. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by [[Chen Duxiu]] and [[Li Dazhao]]. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the nationalist [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) [[Nationalist government|government]] from [[mainland China]] after the [[Chinese Civil War]], leading to the establishment of the People's Republic of China. It also controls the world's largest armed forces, the [[People's Liberation Army]].\n\nThe CPC is officially organised on the basis of [[democratic centralism]], a principle conceived by Russian [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[Theoretician (Marxism)|theoretician]] [[Vladimir Lenin]] which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the [[National Congress of the Communist Party of China|National Congress]], convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of China|Politburo]] and its [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Standing Committee]]. The [[List of leaders of the Communist Party of China|party's leader]] holds the offices of [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] (responsible for civilian party duties), [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and [[President of the People's Republic of China|State President]] (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country's [[paramount leader]]. The current paramount leader is [[Xi Jinping]], elected at the [[18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China|18th National Congress]] held in October 2012.\n\nThe CPC is committed to [[communism]] and continues to participate in the [[International Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties]] each year. According to the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party constitution]], the CPC adheres to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]], [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]], [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]], the [[Three Represents]], the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]] and [[Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese characteristics for a New Era]]. The official explanation for [[Reform and opening-up|China's economic reforms]] is that the country is in the [[primary stage of socialism]], a developmental stage similar to the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]]. The [[command economy]] established under [[Mao Zedong]] was replaced by the [[socialist market economy]], the [[Economy of China|current economic system]], on the basis that \"Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth\".\n\nSince the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of Eastern European communist governments]] in 1989\u20131990 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the CPC has emphasised its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining [[socialist state]]s. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling [[communist parties]] around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of [[one-party states]] (whatever their ideology), [[Dominant-party system|dominant parties]] in [[democracies]] (whatever their ideology) and [[Social democracy|social democratic]] parties.\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of the Communist Party of China}}\n\n=== Founding and early history (1921\u20131927) ===\nThe CPC has its origins in the [[May Fourth Movement]] of 1919, during which radical Western ideologies like [[Marxism]] and [[Anarchism in China|anarchism]] gained traction among Chinese intellectuals.<ref name=\"XinhuaCCPhistory\" /> Other influences stemming from the Bolshevik revolution and Marxist theory inspired the Communist Party of China.<ref>{{cite book |title=The World Transformed:1945 to the Present |last=Hunt |first=Michael |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2013 |location= |page = 114 }}</ref> [[Li Dazhao]] was the first leading Chinese intellectual who publicly supported [[Leninism]] and [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=26}} In contrast to [[Chen Duxiu]], Li did not renounce participation in the affairs of the [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} Both of them regarded the [[October Revolution]] in Russia as groundbreaking, believing it to herald a new era for oppressed countries everywhere.{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=27}} The CPC was modeled on [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s theory of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|pp=34\u201338}} Study circles were, according to [[Cai Hesen]], \"the rudiments [of our party]\".{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=38}} Several study circles were established during the [[New Culture Movement]], but \"by 1920 skepticism about their suitability as vehicles for reform had become widespread.\"{{sfn|Van de Ven|1991|p=44}}\n\nThe [[1st National Congress of the Communist Party of China|founding National Congress]] of the CPC was held on 23\u201331 July 1921.<ref>[http://www.chinatoday.com/org/cpc/cpc_1st_congress_standing_polibureau.htm 1st.

A battalion led by General [[Zhu De]] was ordered to take the city of [[Nanchang]] on 1 August 1927 in what became known as the [[Nanchang uprising]]; initially successful, they were forced into retreat after five days, marching south to [[Shantou]], and from there being driven into the wilderness of [[Fujian]].{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=63}} [[Mao Zedong]] was appointed commander-in-chief of the Red Army, and led four regiments against Changsha in the [[Autumn Harvest Uprising]], hoping to spark peasant uprisings across Hunan.{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=64}} His plan was to attack the KMT-held city from three directions on 9 September, but the Fourth Regiment deserted to the KMT cause, attacking the Third Regiment. Mao's army made it to Changsha, but could not take it; by 15 September, he accepted defeat, with 1,000 survivors marching east to the [[Jinggang Mountains]] of [[Jiangxi]].{{sfn|Carter|1976|p=64}}{{sfn|Schram|1966|pp=122\u2013125}}{{sfn|Feigon|2002|pp=46\u201347}}\n\n=== Chinese Civil War and World War II (1927\u20131949) ===\n{{Further|Chinese Civil War|Chinese Soviet Republic|Chinese Red Army|Long March|Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese Communist Revolution}}\n\n[[File:\u4e2d\u570b\u5de5\u8fb2\u7d05\u8ecd\u8ecd\u65d7.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Flag of the [[History of the People's Liberation Army#From the founding of the People's Liberation Army to the Korean War|Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army]]]]\n\nThe near-destruction of the CPC's urban organizational apparatus led to institutional changes within the party.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The party adopted [[democratic centralism]], a way to organize revolutionary parties, and established a Politburo (to function as the standing committee of the Central Committee).{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The result was increased centralization of power within the party .{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} At every level of the party this was duplicated, with standing committees now in effective control.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} After Chen Duxiu's dismissal, [[Li Lisan]] was able to assume ''de facto'' control of the party organization by 1929\u201330.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} Li Lisan's leadership was a failure, leaving the CPC on the brink of destruction.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The [[Comintern]] became involved, and by late 1930, his powers had been taken away.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} By 1935 Mao had become the party's informal leader, with [[Zhou Enlai]] and [[Zhang Wentian]], the formal head of the party, serving as his informal deputies.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}} The conflict with the KMT led to the reorganization of the Red Army, with power now centralized in the leadership through the creation of CPC political departments charged with supervising the army.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=72}}\n\nThe [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] caused a pause in the conflict between the CPC and the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=370}} The [[Second United Front]] was established between the CPC and the KMT to tackle the invasion.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=354}} While the front formally existed until 1945, all collaboration between the two parties had ended by 1940.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=354}} Despite their formal alliance, the CPC used the opportunity to expand and carve out independent bases of operations to prepare for the coming war with the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} In 1939 the KMT began to restrict CPC expansion within China.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} This led to frequent clashes between CPC and KMT forces{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} but which subsided rapidly on the realisation on both sides that civil war was not an option.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}} Yet, by 1943, the CPC was again actively expanding its territory at the expense of the KMT.{{sfn|Leung|1992|p=355}}\n\n[[File:Mao proclaiming the establishment of the PRC in 1949.jpg|thumb|Mao Zedong declared the establishment of the People's Republic of China on 1 October 1949]]\n\nFrom 1945 until 1949, the war had been reduced to two parties;

|accessdate = 4 January 2014 }}</ref> In recent years, noting the self-reform of the European social democratic movement in the 1980s and 1990s, the CPC \"has noted the increased marginalization of West European communist parties.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=100}}\n\n==== Ruling parties of socialist states ====\nThe CPC has retained close relations with the remaining [[socialist state]]s still espousing [[communism]]: [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]] and their respective ruling parties as well as [[North Korea]] and its ruling party, which officially abandoned communism in 2009.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=81}} It spends a fair amount of time analyzing the situation in the remaining socialist states, trying to reach conclusions as to why these states survived when so many did not, following the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Eastern European socialist states]] in 1989 and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} In general, the analyses of the remaining socialist states and their chances of survival have been positive, and the CPC believes that the socialist movement will be revitalized sometime in the future.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}}\n\nThe ruling party which the CPC is most interested in is the [[Communist Party of Vietnam]] (CPV).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} In general the CPV is considered a model example of socialist development in the post-Soviet era.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} Chinese analysts on Vietnam believe that the introduction of the [[Doi Moi]] reform policy at the [[6th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam|6th CPV National Congress]] is the key reason for Vietnam's current success.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}}\n\nWhile the CPC is probably the organization with [[China-North Korea relations|most access to North Korea]], writing about North Korea is tightly circumscribed.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} The few reports accessible to the general public are those about [[North Korean economic reform]]s.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=82}} While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for [[Economy of North Korea|North Korea's economic system]], the [[North Korea's cult of personality|cult of personality]] which pervades society, the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the [[Korean People's Army]] and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=82\u201383}} There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the [[Cultural Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the [[Workers' Party of Korea]] (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the [[First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK general secretary]] [[Kim Jong-il]] to [[North China Plain|Guandong province]] to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}} In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=83}}\n\nThere is a considerable degree of interest in Cuba within the CPC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[Fidel Castro]], the former [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] (PCC), is greatly admired, and books have been written focusing on the successes of the [[Cuban Revolution]].{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=84}} [[China-Cuba relations|Communication between the CPC and the PCC]] has increased considerably since the 1990s, hardly a month going by without a diplomatic exchange.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=85}} At the 4th Plenary Session of the [[16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|16th Central Committee]], which discussed the possibility of the CPC learning from other ruling parties, praise was heaped on the PCC.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008 |p=85}} When [[Wu Guanzheng]], a Central Politburo member, met with Fidel Castro in 2007, he gave him a personal letter written by Hu Jintao: \"Facts have shown that China and Cuba are trustworthy good friends, good comrades, and good brothers who treat each other with sincerity. The two countries' friendship has withstood the test of a changeable international situation, and the friendship has been further strengthened and consolidated.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=85\u201386}}\n\n=== Non-communist parties ===\nSince the decline and fall of communism in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties.{{sfn|Smith|West|2012|p=127}} These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=86\u201392}} For instance, the CPC has been eager to understand how the [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party of Singapore]] (PAP) maintains its total domination over [[Politics of Singapore|Singaporean politics]] through its \"low-key presence, but total control.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} According to the CPC's own analysis of [[Singapore]], the PAP's dominance can be explained by its \"well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups.\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a [[liberal democracy]], they view it as a [[guided democracy]] led by the PAP.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=93}} Other differences are, according to the CPC, \"that it is not a political party based on the working class\u2014instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the [[parliamentary system]], not a [[vanguard party|revolutionary party]].\"{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=94}} Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the [[United Malays National Organisation]], which has ruled [[Malaysia]] democratically since 1957, and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in [[Japan]], which dominated [[Japanese politics]] for over five uninterrupted decades.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|pp=95\u201396}}\n\nThe CPC has, since Jiang Zemin's time, made friendly overtures to its erstwhile foe, the Kuomintang. The CPC emphasizes strong party-to-party relations with the KMT so as to strengthen the probability of the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} However, several studies have been written on the KMT's loss of power in 2000, after having ruled Taiwan since 1949 (the KMT officially ruled mainland China from 1928 to 1949).{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} In general, one-party states or dominant-party states are of special interest to the party, and party-to-party relations are formed so that the CPC can study them.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=96}} For instance, the longevity of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party \u2013 Syria Region|Syrian Regional Branch]] of the [[Ba'ath Party (Syrian-dominated faction)|Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party]] is attributed to the personalization of power in the [[al-Assad family]], the strong [[presidential system]], the inheritance of power, which passed from [[Hafez al-Assad]] to his son [[Bashar al-Assad]], and the role given to the [[Syrian military]] in politics.{{sfn|Shambaugh|2008|p=97}}\n[[File:Cena de Estado que en honor del Excmo.

Liquid nitrogen is the most commonly used element in cryogenics and is legally purchasable around the world. Liquid helium is also commonly used and allows for the lowest attainable temperatures to be reached.\n\nThese liquids may be stored in [[Dewar flask]]s, which are double-walled containers with a high vacuum between the walls to reduce heat transfer into the liquid.  Typical laboratory Dewar flasks are spherical, made of glass and protected in a metal outer container.  Dewar flasks for extremely cold liquids such as liquid helium have another double-walled container filled with liquid nitrogen.  Dewar flasks are named after their inventor, [[James Dewar]], the man who first liquefied [[hydrogen]].  [[Thermos]] bottles are smaller [[vacuum flask]]s fitted in a protective casing.\n\nCryogenic barcode labels are used to mark dewar flasks containing these liquids, and will not frost over down to \u2212195 degrees Celsius.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thermal|first1=Timmy|title=Cryogenic Labels|url=http://www.midcomdata.com/cryogenic-labels/|website=MidcomData|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nCryogenic transfer pumps are the pumps used on [[LNG pier]]s to transfer [[liquefied natural gas]] from [[LNG carrier]]s to [[Storage tank|LNG storage tanks]], as are cryogenic valves.\n\n=== Cryogenic processing ===\nThe field of cryogenics advanced during World War II when scientists found that metals frozen to low temperatures showed more resistance to wear.  Based on this theory of [[cryogenic hardening]], the commercial [[cryogenic processor|cryogenic processing]] industry was founded in 1966 by Ed Busch. With a background in the [[heat treatment|heat treating]] industry, Busch founded a company in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] called CryoTech in 1966 <ref>{{cite book|last1=Gantz|first1=Carroll|title=Refrigeration: A History|date=2015|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-7687-9|page=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UgjCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA227&dq=ed+busch+cryotech&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwifsIKqh9fZAhVL8IMKHaH6ARkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=ed%20busch%20cryotech&f=false}}</ref> which merged with [http://www.300below.com/ 300 Below] in 1999 to become the world's largest and oldest commercial cryogenic processing company.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} Busch originally experimented with the possibility of increasing the life of metal tools to anywhere between 200%-400% of the original life expectancy using [[cryogenic tempering]] instead of heat treating.{{Citation needed|reason=Materials would re-age at room temperature.|date=March 2015}} This evolved in the late 1990s into the treatment of other parts.\n\nCryogens, such as liquid [[nitrogen]], are further used for specialty chilling and freezing applications.  Some chemical reactions, like those used to produce the active ingredients for the popular [[statin]] drugs, must occur at low temperatures of approximately {{convert|\u2212100|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. Special cryogenic [[chemical reactor]]s are used to remove reaction heat and provide a low temperature environment.  The freezing of foods and biotechnology products, like [[vaccine]]s, requires nitrogen in blast freezing or immersion freezing systems. Certain soft or elastic materials become hard and [[brittleness|brittle]] at very low temperatures, which makes cryogenic [[mill (grinding)|milling]] ([[cryomilling]]) an option for some materials that cannot easily be milled at higher temperatures.\n\nCryogenic processing is not a substitute for heat treatment, but rather an extension of the heating - quenching - tempering cycle. Normally, when an item is quenched, the final temperature is ambient. The only reason for this is that most heat treaters do not have cooling equipment. There is nothing metallurgically significant about ambient temperature. The cryogenic process continues this action from ambient temperature down to {{convert|-320|\u00b0F|\u00b0R K \u00b0C|0}}.\nIn most instances the cryogenic cycle is followed by a heat tempering procedure. As all alloys do not have the same chemical constituents, the tempering procedure varies according to the material's chemical composition, thermal history and/or a tool's particular service application.\n\nThe entire process takes 3\u20134 days.\n\n=== Fuels ===\n\nAnother use of cryogenics is [[cryogenic fuel]]s for rockets with [[liquid hydrogen]] as the most widely used example. [[Liquid oxygen]] (LOX) is even more widely used but as an [[oxidizer]], not a fuel. [[NASA]]'s workhorse [[space shuttle]] used cryogenic hydrogen/oxygen propellant as its primary means of getting into [[orbit]]. LOX is also widely used with [[RP-1]] kerosene, a non-cryogenic hydrocarbon, such as in the rockets built for the [[Soviet space program]] by [[Sergei Korolev]].\n\nRussian aircraft manufacturer [[Tupolev]] developed a version of its popular design [[Tu-154]] with a cryogenic fuel system, known as the [[Tu-155]]. The plane uses a fuel referred to as  [[liquefied natural gas]] or LNG, and made its first flight in 1989.\n\n== Other applications ==\n[[File:The MUSE instrument on the VLT.jpg|thumb|Astronomical instruments on the [[Very Large Telescope]] are equipped with continuous flow cooling systems.<ref>{{cite web|title=ESO Signs Technology Transfer Licence Agreement for Cooling System|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann15041/|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>]]\nSome applications of cryogenics:\n\n* [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) is one of the most common methods to determine the physical and chemical properties of atoms by detecting the radio frequency absorbed and subsequent relaxation of nuclei in a magnetic field.  This is one of the most commonly used characterization techniques and has applications in numerous fields.  Primarily, the strong magnetic fields are generated by supercooling electromagnets, although there are [[Benchtop NMR spectrometer|spectrometers]] that do not require cryogens.  In traditional superconducting solenoids, liquid helium is used to cool the inner coils because it has a boiling point of around 4 K at ambient pressure.  Cheap metallic superconductors can be used for the coil wiring.  So-called high-temperature superconducting compounds can be made to super conduct with the use of liquid nitrogen which boils at around 77 K.\n* [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) is a complex application of NMR where the geometry of the resonances is deconvoluted and used to image objects by detecting the relaxation of protons that have been perturbed by a radio-frequency pulse in the strong magnetic field. This is mostly commonly used in health applications.\n* In large cities, [[electric power transmission]] is difficult to transmit power by overhead cables in big cities, so underground cables are used. But underground cables get heated and the resistance of the wire increases leading to waste of power.  Superconductors could be used to increase power throughput, although they would require cryogenic liquids such as nitrogen or helium to cool special alloy-containing cables to increase power transmission.  Several feasibility studies have been performed and the field is the subject of an agreement within the [[International Energy Agency]].\n[[Image:Cryogenic Gases Delivery Truck Ypsilanti Michigan.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cryogenic gases delivery truck at a supermarket, [[Ypsilanti, Michigan]]]]\n* Cryogenic gases are used in transportation and storage of large masses of [[frozen food]]. When very large quantities of food must be transported to regions like war zones, earthquake hit regions, etc., they must be stored for a long time, so cryogenic food freezing is used. Cryogenic food freezing is also helpful for large scale food processing industries.\n*Many infra-red ([[forward looking infrared]]) cameras require their detectors to be cryogenically cooled.\n* Certain rare blood groups are stored at low temperatures, such as \u2212165&nbsp;\u00b0C at blood banks.\n* Cryogenics technology using [[liquid nitrogen]] and CO<sub>2</sub> has been built into [[nightclub]] effect systems to create a chilling effect and white fog that can be illuminated with colored lights.\n* Cryogenic cooling is used to cool the tool tip at the time of machining in [[manufacturing process]]. It increases the tool life. Oxygen is used to perform several important functions in the steel manufacturing process.\n* Many [[rocket]]s use cryogenic gases as propellants. These include liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen, and liquid methane.\n*By freezing the automobile or truck tire in liquid nitrogen, the rubber is made brittle and can be crushed into small particles. These particles can be used again for other items.\n*Experimental research on certain physics phenomena, such as spintronics and magnetotransport properties, requires cryogenic temperatures for the effects to be observed.\n\n== Production ==\nCryogenic cooling of devices and material is usually achieved via the use of [[liquid nitrogen]], [[liquid helium]], or a [[Cryocooler|mechanical cryocooler]] (which uses high pressure helium lines). Gifford-McMahon cryocoolers, [[Pulse tube refrigerator|pulse tube cryocoolers]] and [[Stirling engine#Stirling cryocoolers|Stirling cryocoolers]] are in wide use with selection based on required base temperature and cooling capacity. The most recent development in cryogenics is the use of magnets as regenerators as well as refrigerators. These devices work on the principle known as the [[Magnetic refrigeration|magnetocaloric]] effect.\n\n== Detectors ==\n\nThere are various [[cryogenic detectors]] which are used to detect cryogenic particles.\n\nFor cryogenic temperature measurement down to 30K, Pt100 sensors, a [[Resistance thermometer|resistance temperature detector (RTD)]], are used. For temperatures lower than 30K it is necessary to use a [[silicon bandgap temperature sensor|silicon diode]] for accuracy.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Absolute zero]]\n* [[Coldest temperature recorded on Earth]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n*Haselden, G.

Guest is most widely known in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] for having written, directed and starred in his series of comedy films shot in mock-documentary ([[mockumentary]]) style. Many scenes and character backgrounds in Guest's films are written and directed, although actors have no rehearsal time and the ensemble improvise scenes while filming them. The series of films began with ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]'', and continued with ''[[Waiting for Guffman]]'', ''[[Best in Show (film)|Best In Show]]'', ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'',  ''[[For Your Consideration (film)|For Your Consideration]]'', and ''[[Mascots (2016 film)|Mascots]]''.\n\nGuest holds a [[Hereditary peer|hereditary]] [[British peerage]] as the 5th [[Baron Haden-Guest]], and has publicly expressed a desire to see the [[House of Lords]] reformed as a democratically elected chamber.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Guardian Weekend]]|title=Nowt so queer as folk|author=Richard Grant|date=January 10, 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend}}</ref> Though he was initially active in the Lords, his career there was cut short by the [[House of Lords Act 1999]], which removed the right of most hereditary peers to a seat in the parliament. When using his title, he is normally [[Style (manner of address)|styled]] as '''Lord Haden-Guest'''. Guest is married to the actress and author [[Jamie Lee Curtis]].\n\n== Early years ==\nGuest was born in New York City, the son of [[Peter Haden-Guest, 4th Baron Haden-Guest|Peter Haden-Guest]], a British [[United Nations]] diplomat who later became the 4th [[Baron Haden-Guest]], and his second wife, Jean Pauline Hindes, an American former vice president of casting at [[CBS]].<ref name=\"ny times\" /> Guest's paternal grandfather, [[Leslie Haden-Guest, 1st Baron Haden-Guest|Leslie, Baron Haden-Guest]], was a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician, who was a [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] to Judaism.

He attended [[The High School of Music & Art]] (New York City), studying classical music (clarinet) at the [[Stockbridge School]] in Interlaken, Massachusetts. He later took up the [[mandolin]], became interested in [[country music]], and played guitar with [[Arlo Guthrie]], a fellow student at Stockbridge School.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nowt so queer as folk|author=Richard Grant|date=January 10, 2004|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jan/10/features.weekend|magazine=[[The Guardian Weekend]] }}</ref> Guest later began performing with [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands until he took up [[rock and roll]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Gross|first=Terry|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14081515|title=Christopher Guest Plays with Parody|work=[[Fresh Air]], [[WHYY-FM|WHYY]]|publisher=[[NPR]]|location=Philadelphia|date=September 14, 1989|accessdate=August 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\nGuest studied acting at [[New York University]]'s [[Tisch School of the Arts#Graduate Acting Program|Graduate Acting Program]] at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]], graduating in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|title=NYU Graduate Acting Alumni |url=http://gradacting.tisch.nyu.edu/object/ga_alumbios.html|year=2011|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 1970s ===\nGuest began his career in theatre during the early 1970s with one of his earliest professional performances being the role of Norman in [[Michael Weller]]'s ''[[Moonchildren]]'' for the play's American premiere at the [[Arena Stage]] in Washington D.C. in November 1971. Guest continued with the production when it moved to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1972. The following year he began making contributions to ''[[The National Lampoon Radio Hour]]'' for a variety of National Lampoon audio recordings. He both performed comic characters (Flash Bazbo\u2014Space Explorer, Mr. Rogers, music critic Roger de Swans, and sleazy record company rep Ron Fields) and wrote, arranged and performed numerous musical parodies (of Bob Dylan, James Taylor and others). He was featured alongside [[Chevy Chase]] and [[John Belushi]] in the [[Off-Broadway]] revue ''[[National Lampoon's Lemmings]]''. Two of his earliest film roles were small parts as uniformed police officers in the 1972 film ''[[The Hot Rock (film)|The Hot Rock]]'' and 1974's ''[[Death Wish (1974 film)|Death Wish]]''.\n\nGuest played a small role in the 1977 ''All In the Family'' episode \"[[List of All in the Family episodes#Season 8: 1977\u20131978|Mike and Gloria Meet]]\", where in a [[flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence Mike and Gloria recall their first blind date, set up by Michael's college buddy Jim (Guest), who dated Gloria's girlfriend Debbie ([[Priscilla Lopez]]).\n\n=== 1980s ===\nGuest's biggest role of the first two decades of his career is likely that of [[Nigel Tufnel]] in the 1984 Rob Reiner film ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]]''. Guest made his first appearance as Tufnel on the 1978 sketch comedy program ''The TV Show''.\n\nAlong with [[Martin Short]], [[Billy Crystal]] and [[Harry Shearer]], Guest was hired as a one-year only cast member for the [[History of Saturday Night Live (1980\u201385)#1984\u201385 season|1984\u201385]] season on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Recurring characters on SNL played by Guest include Frankie, of Willie and Frankie (coworkers who recount in detail physically painful situations in which they have found themselves, remarking laconically \"I hate when that happens\"); Herb Minkman, a shady novelty toymaker with a brother named Al (played by Crystal); Rajeev Vindaloo, an eccentric foreign man in the same vein as [[Andy Kaufman]]'s [[Latka Gravas|Latka]] character from ''[[Taxi (TV series)|Taxi]]''; and Se\u00f1or Cosa, a Spanish ventriloquist often seen on the recurring spoof of ''[[The Joe Franklin Show]]''. He also experimented behind the camera with pre-filmed sketches, notably directing a documentary-style short starring Shearer and Short as synchronized swimmers. In another short film from SNL, Guest and Crystal appear as retired [[Negro league baseball]] players, \"The Rooster and the King\".\n\nHe appeared as Count Rugen in ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. He had a cameo role as the first customer, a pedestrian, in the 1986 musical [[Little Shop of Horrors (1986 film)|remake]] of ''[[The Little Shop of Horrors]]'', that also featured Steve Martin. As a co-writer and director, Guest made the Hollywood satire ''[[The Big Picture (1989 film)|The Big Picture]]''.\n\nUpon his father succeeding to the family [[peerage]] in 1987, he was known as ''[[The Honourable|The Hon.]] Christopher Haden-Guest''. This was his official [[Style (manner of address)|style]] and name until he inherited the barony in 1996.\n\n=== 1990\u2013present ===\nThe experience of having made ''Spinal Tap'' would directly inform the second phase of his career. Starting in 1996, Guest began writing, directing and acting in his own series of substantially [[Improvisational comedy|improvised]] films. Many of them would come to be definitive examples of what came to be known as \"mockumentaries\"\u2014not a term Guest appreciates in describing his unusual approach to exploring the passions that make the characters in his films so interesting. He maintains that his intention is not to mock anyone, but to explore insular, perhaps obscure communities through his method of filmmaking.\n\nHis frequent writing partner is [[Eugene Levy]]. Together, Levy, Guest and a small band of other actors have formed a loose [[repertory]] group, which appear across several films. These include [[Catherine O'Hara]], [[Michael McKean]], [[Parker Posey]], [[Bob Balaban]], [[Jane Lynch]], [[John Michael Higgins]], [[Harry Shearer]], [[Jennifer Coolidge]], [[Ed Begley, Jr.]] and [[Fred Willard]]. Guest and Levy write backgrounds for each of the characters and notecards for each specific scene, outlining the plot, and then leave it up to the actors to improvise the dialogue, which is supposed to result in a much more natural conversation than scripted dialogue would. Typically, everyone who appears in these movies receives the same fee and the same portion of profits.<ref name=\"crose03\">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2003/05/12/1/a-conversation-with-director-christopher-guest|last=Rose|first=Charlie|title=A conversation with director Christopher Guest|publisher=Charlie Rose LLC|date=May 12, 2003|accessdate=August 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201094915/http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2003/05/12/1/a-conversation-with-director-christopher-guest|archivedate=December 1, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nGuest had a guest voice-over role in the animated comedy series ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' as SpongeBob's cousin, Stanley.\n\nGuest appeared as Dr. Stone in ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), as Lord Cromer in ''[[Mrs Henderson Presents]]'' (2005) and in the 2009 comedy ''[[The Invention of Lying]]''.\n\nHe is also currently a member of the musical group [[The Beyman Bros]], which he formed with childhood friend [[David Nichtern]] and Spinal Tap's current keyboardist [[C.

According to an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Guest attended the [[House of Lords]] regularly until the [[House of Lords Act 1999]] barred most hereditary peers from their seats.

They have two [[adoption|adopted]] children: Anne (born 1986) and Thomas (born 1996). Because Guest's children are adopted, they cannot inherit the family barony under the terms of the [[letters patent]] that created it, though a 2004 [[Warrant (law)|Royal Warrant]] addressing the style of a peer's adopted children states that they can use [[Courtesy titles in the United Kingdom|courtesy titles]]. The current [[heir presumptive]] to the barony is Guest's younger brother, actor [[Nicholas Guest]].\n\n== Off-stage demeanor ==\nAs reported by Louis B. Hobson, \"On film, Guest is a hilariously droll comedian. In person he is serious and almost dour.\" He quotes Guest as saying \"People want me to be funny all the time. They think I'm being funny no matter what I say or do and that's not the case. I rarely joke unless I'm in front of a camera. It's not what I am in real life. It's what I do for a living.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Hobson|first=Louis B|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/G/Guest_Christopher/2000/10/10/pf-758773.html|title=Guest Shots|publisher=Canoe Inc.|work=Canoe Jam!|date=October 10, 2000|accessdate=August 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n=== Film ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Title\n! colspan=\"4\" | Credit\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Role\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes\n|-\n!

A C*-algebra is a [[complex number|complex]] [[algebra over a field|algebra]] ''A'' of [[continuous linear operator]]s on a [[complex number|complex]] [[Hilbert space]] with two additional properties:\n\n* ''A'' is a topologically [[closed set]] in the [[norm topology]] of operators.\n* ''A'' is closed under the operation of taking [[adjoint of an operator|adjoint]]s of operators.\n\nC*-algebras were first considered primarily for their use in [[quantum mechanics]] to [[model (abstract)|model]] algebras of physical [[observable]]s.  This line of research began with [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[matrix mechanics]] and in a more mathematically developed form with [[Pascual Jordan]] around 1933.  Subsequently, [[John von Neumann]] attempted to establish a general framework for these algebras which culminated in a series of papers on rings of operators.  These papers considered a special class of C*-algebras which are now known as [[von Neumann algebra]]s.\n\nAround 1943, the work of [[Israel Gelfand]] and [[Mark Naimark]] yielded an abstract characterisation of C*-algebras making no reference to operators on a Hilbert space.\n\nC*-algebras are now an important tool in the theory of [[unitary representation]]s of [[locally compact group]]s, and are also used in algebraic formulations of quantum mechanics. Another active area of research is the program to obtain classification, or to determine the extent of which classification is possible, for separable simple [[nuclear C*-algebra]]s.\n\n== Abstract characterization ==\n\nWe begin with the abstract characterization of C*-algebras given in the 1943 paper by Gelfand and Naimark.\n\nA C*-algebra, ''A'', is a [[Banach algebra]] over the field of [[complex number]]s, together with a [[Map (mathematics)|map]] * : ''A'' \u2192 ''A''. One writes ''x*'' for the image of an element ''x'' of ''A''. The map * has the following properties:\n\n* It is an [[Semigroup with involution|involution]], for every ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math> x^{**} = (x^*)^* =  x </math>\n\n* For all ''x'', ''y'' in ''A'':\n::<math> (x + y)^* = x^* + y^* </math>\n::<math> (x y)^* = y^* x^*</math>\n\n* For every complex number \u03bb in '''C''' and every ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math> (\\lambda x)^* = \\overline{\\lambda} x^* .</math>\n\n* For all ''x'' in ''A'':\n::<math>  \\|x^* x \\| = \\|x\\|\\|x^*\\|.</math>\n\n'''Remark.''' The first three identities say that ''A'' is a [[*-algebra]]. The last identity is called the '''C* identity''' and is equivalent to:\n\n<math>\\|xx^*\\| = \\|x\\|^2,</math>\n\nwhich is sometimes called the B*-identity. For history behind the names C*- and B*-algebras, see the [[#Some_history:_B.2A-algebras_and_C.2A-algebras|history]] section below.\n\nThe C*-identity is a very strong requirement. For instance, together with the [[spectral radius|spectral radius formula]], it implies that the C*-norm is uniquely determined by the algebraic structure:\n\n::<math> \\|x\\|^2 = \\|x^* x\\| = \\sup\\{|\\lambda| : x^* x - \\lambda \\,1 \\text{ is not invertible} \\}.</math>\n\nA [[bounded linear map]], \u03c0 : ''A'' \u2192 ''B'', between C*-algebras ''A'' and ''B'' is called a '''*-homomorphism''' if\n\n* For ''x'' and ''y'' in ''A''\n\n::<math> \\pi(x y) = \\pi(x) \\pi(y) \\,</math>\n\n* For ''x'' in ''A''\n\n::<math> \\pi(x^*) = \\pi(x)^* \\,</math>\n\nIn the case of C*-algebras, any *-homomorphism \u03c0 between C*-algebras is [[Contraction (operator theory)|contractive]], i.e. bounded with norm \u2264 1. Furthermore, an injective *-homomorphism between C*-algebras is [[isometry|isometric]]. These are consequences of the C*-identity.\n\nA bijective *-homomorphism \u03c0 is called a '''C*-isomorphism''', in which case ''A'' and ''B'' are said to be '''isomorphic'''.\n\n== Some history: B*-algebras and C*-algebras ==\nThe term B*-algebra was introduced by C. E. Rickart in 1946 to describe [[Banach *-algebra]]s that satisfy the condition:\n\n* <math>\\lVert x x^* \\rVert = \\lVert x \\rVert ^2</math> for all ''x'' in the given B*-algebra. (B*-condition)\n\nThis condition automatically implies that the *-involution is isometric, that is, <math>\\lVert x \\rVert = \\lVert x^* \\rVert </math>. Hence, <math>\\lVert xx^*\\rVert = \\lVert x \\rVert \\lVert x^*\\rVert</math>, and therefore, a B*-algebra is also a C*-algebra. Conversely, the C*-condition implies the B*-condition. This is nontrivial, and can be proved without using the condition <math>\\lVert x \\rVert = \\lVert x^* \\rVert</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|pp=5\u20136}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&pg=PA5 Google Books].</ref> For these reasons, the term B*-algebra is rarely used in current terminology, and has been replaced by the term 'C*-algebra'.\n\nThe term C*-algebra was introduced by [[Irving Segal|I. E. Segal]] in 1947 to describe norm-closed subalgebras of ''B''(''H''), namely, the space of bounded operators on some Hilbert space ''H''. 'C' stood for 'closed'.<ref>{{harvnb|Doran|Belfi|1986|p=6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6jNbsnJVjMoC&pg=PA6 Google Books].</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Segal|1947}}</ref> In his paper Segal defines a C*-algebra as a \"uniformly closed, self-adjoint algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space\".<ref>{{harvnb|Segal|1947|p=75}}</ref>\n\n== Structure of C*-algebras ==\n\nC*-algebras have a large number of properties that are technically convenient. Some of these properties can be established by using the [[continuous functional calculus]] or by reduction to commutative  C*-algebras.  In the latter case, we can use the fact that the structure of these is completely determined by the [[Gelfand isomorphism]].\n\n=== Self-adjoint elements ===\n\nSelf-adjoint elements are those of the form ''x''=''x''*. The set of elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' of the form ''x*x'' forms a closed [[convex cone]].  This cone is identical to the elements of the form ''xx*''. Elements of this cone are called ''non-negative'' (or sometimes ''positive'', even though this terminology conflicts with its use for elements of '''R'''.)\n\nThe set of self-adjoint elements of a C*-algebra ''A'' naturally has the structure of a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[vector space]]; the ordering is usually denoted \u2265. In this ordering, a self-adjoint element ''x'' of ''A'' satisfies ''x'' \u2265 0 if and only if the [[Spectrum (functional analysis)|spectrum]] of ''x''  is non-negative,{{clarify|Under the Gelfand representation?|date=August 2014}} if and only if ''x'' = ''s*s'' for some ''s''. Two self-adjoint elements ''x'' and ''y'' of ''A'' satisfy ''x'' \u2265 ''y'' if ''x''\u2212''y'' \u2265 0.\n\nThis partially ordered subspace allows the definition of a [[positive linear functional]] on a C*-algebra, which in turn is used to define the [[State (functional analysis)|states]] of a C*-algebra, which in turn can be used to construct the [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]] using the [[GNS construction]].\n\n=== Quotients and approximate identities ===\n\nAny C*-algebra ''A'' has an [[approximate identity]].  In fact, there is a directed family {''e''<sub>\u03bb</sub>}<sub>\u03bb\u2208I</sub> of self-adjoint elements of ''A'' such that\n\n:: <math> x e_\\lambda \\rightarrow x </math>\n:: <math> 0 \\leq e_\\lambda \\leq e_\\mu \\leq 1\\quad \\mbox{ whenever } \\lambda \\leq \\mu. </math>\n\n: In case ''A'' is separable, ''A'' has a sequential approximate identity. More generally, ''A'' will have a sequential approximate identity if and only if ''A'' contains a '''[[Hereditary C*-subalgebra|strictly positive element]]''', i.e. a positive element ''h'' such that ''hAh'' is dense in ''A''.\n\nUsing approximate identities, one can show that the algebraic [[quotient]] of a C*-algebra by a closed proper two-sided [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]], with the natural norm, is a C*-algebra.\n\nSimilarly, a closed two-sided ideal of a C*-algebra is itself a C*-algebra.\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Finite-dimensional C*-algebras ===\nThe algebra M(''n'', '''C''') of ''n'' \u00d7 ''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over '''C''' becomes a C*-algebra if we consider matrices as operators on the Euclidean space, '''C'''<sup>''n''</sup>, and  use the [[operator norm]] ||.|| on matrices. The involution is given by the [[conjugate transpose]].  More generally, one can consider finite [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s of matrix algebras. In fact, all C*-algebras that are finite dimensional as vector spaces are of this form, up to isomorphism. The self-adjoint requirement means finite-dimensional C*-algebras are [[Semisimple algebra|semisimple]], from which fact one can deduce the following theorem of [[Artin\u2013Wedderburn theorem|Artin\u2013Wedderburn]] type:\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.'''  A finite-dimensional C*-algebra, ''A'', is [[Canonical form|canonically]] isomorphic to a finite direct sum\n:<math> A = \\bigoplus_{e \\in \\min A } A e</math>\nwhere min ''A'' is the set of minimal nonzero self-adjoint central projections of ''A''.</blockquote>\n\nEach C*-algebra, ''Ae'', is isomorphic (in a noncanonical way) to the full matrix algebra M(dim(''e''), '''C'''). The finite family indexed on min ''A'' given by {dim(''e'')}<sub>''e''</sub> is called the ''dimension vector'' of ''A''.  This vector uniquely determines the isomorphism class of a finite-dimensional C*-algebra. In the language of [[operator K-theory|K-theory]], this vector is the [[ordered group|positive cone]] of the ''K''<sub>0</sub> group of ''A''.\n\nA '''\u2020-algebra''' (or, more explicitly, a ''\u2020-closed algebra'') is the name occasionally used in [[physics]]<ref>John A. Holbrook, David W. Kribs, and Raymond Laflamme. \"Noiseless Subsystems and the Structure of the Commutant in Quantum Error Correction.\" ''Quantum Information Processing''. Volume 2, Number 5, p. 381&ndash;419.  Oct 2003.</ref> for a finite-dimensional C*-algebra.  The [[dagger (typography)|dagger]], \u2020, is used in the name because physicists typically use the symbol to denote a [[Hermitian adjoint]], and are often not worried about the subtleties associated with an infinite number of dimensions.  (Mathematicians usually use the asterisk, *, to denote the Hermitian adjoint.) \u2020-algebras feature prominently in [[quantum mechanics]], and especially [[quantum information science]].\n\nAn immediate generalization of finite dimensional C*-algebras are the [[approximately finite dimensional C*-algebra]]s.\n\n=== C*-algebras of operators ===\nThe prototypical example of a C*-algebra is the algebra ''B(H)'' of bounded (equivalently continuous) [[linear operator]]s defined on a complex [[Hilbert space]] ''H''; here ''x*'' denotes the [[adjoint operator]] of the operator ''x'' : ''H'' \u2192 ''H''. In fact, every C*-algebra, ''A'', is *-isomorphic to a norm-closed adjoint closed subalgebra of ''B''(''H'') for a suitable Hilbert space, ''H''; this is the content of the [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark theorem]].\n\n=== C*-algebras of compact operators ===\nLet ''H'' be a [[separable space|separable]] infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The algebra ''K''(''H'') of [[Compact operator on Hilbert space|compact operator]]s on ''H'' is a [[norm closed]] subalgebra of ''B''(''H''). It is also closed under involution; hence it is a  C*-algebra.\n\nConcrete C*-algebras of compact operators admit a characterization similar to Wedderburn's theorem for finite dimensional C*-algebras:\n\n<blockquote>'''Theorem.''' If ''A'' is a C*-subalgebra of ''K''(''H''), then there exists Hilbert spaces {''H<sub>i</sub>''}<sub>''i''\u2208''I''</sub> such that\n:<math> A \\cong \\bigoplus_{i \\in I } K(H_i),</math>\nwhere the (C*-)direct sum consists of elements (''T<sub>i</sub>'') of the Cartesian product \u03a0 ''K''(''H<sub>i</sub>'') with ||''T<sub>i</sub>''|| \u2192 0.</blockquote>\n\nThough ''K''(''H'')  does not have an identity element, a sequential [[approximate identity]] for ''K''(''H'') can be developed. To be specific, ''H'' is isomorphic to the space  of square summable sequences ''l''<sup>2</sup>; we may assume that ''H'' = ''l''<sup>2</sup>.  For each natural number ''n'' let ''H<sub>n</sub>'' be the subspace of sequences of ''l''<sup>2</sup> which vanish for indices ''k'' \u2264 ''n'' and let ''e<sub>n</sub>'' be the orthogonal projection onto ''H<sub>n</sub>''. The sequence {''e<sub>n</sub>''}<sub>''n''</sub> is an approximate identity for ''K''(''H'').\n\n''K''(''H'') is a two-sided closed ideal of ''B''(''H''). For separable Hilbert spaces, it is the unique ideal. The [[quotient]] of ''B''(''H'') by ''K''(''H'') is the [[Calkin algebra]].\n\n=== Commutative C*-algebras ===\nLet ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] Hausdorff space.  The space <math>C_0(X)</math> of complex-valued continuous functions on ''X'' that ''vanish at infinity'' (defined in the article on [[locally compact|local compactness]]) form a commutative C*-algebra <math>C_0(X)</math> under pointwise multiplication and addition. The involution is pointwise conjugation. <math>C_0(X)</math> has a multiplicative unit element if and only if <math>X</math> is  compact.  As does any C*-algebra, <math>C_0(X)</math> has an [[approximate identity]]. In the case of <math>C_0(X)</math> this is immediate: consider the directed set of compact subsets of <math>X</math>, and for each compact <math>K</math> let <math>f_K</math> be a function of compact support which is identically 1 on <math>K</math>.  Such functions exist by the [[Tietze extension theorem]] which applies to locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Any such sequence of functions <math>\\{f_K\\}</math> is an approximate identity.\n\nThe [[Gelfand representation]] states that every commutative C*-algebra is *-isomorphic to the algebra <math>C_0(X)</math>, where <math>X</math> is the space of [[Character (mathematics)|characters]] equipped with the [[Weak topology|weak* topology]]. Furthermore, if <math>C_0(X)</math> is [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to <math>C_0(Y)</math> as C*-algebras, it follows that <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math> are [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]]. This characterization is one of the motivations for the [[noncommutative topology]] and [[noncommutative geometry]] programs.\n\n=== C*-enveloping algebra ===\nGiven a Banach *-algebra ''A'' with an [[approximate identity]], there is a unique (up to C*-isomorphism) C*-algebra '''E'''(''A'') and *-morphism \u03c0 from ''A'' into '''E'''(''A'') which is [[universal morphism|universal]], that is, every other continuous *-morphism {{nowrap|\u03c0\u2009'\u2009: ''A'' \u2192 ''B''}} factors uniquely through \u03c0.  The algebra '''E'''(''A'') is called the '''C*-enveloping algebra''' of the Banach *-algebra ''A''.\n\nOf particular importance is the C*-algebra of a [[locally compact group]] ''G''.  This is defined as the enveloping C*-algebra of the [[group algebra]] of ''G''.  The  C*-algebra of ''G''  provides context for general [[harmonic analysis]] of ''G'' in the case ''G'' is non-abelian.  In particular, the dual of a locally compact group is defined to be the primitive ideal space of the group C*-algebra.  See [[spectrum of a C*-algebra]].\n\n=== Von Neumann algebras ===\n\n[[Von Neumann algebra]]s, known as W* algebras before the 1960s, are a special kind of C*-algebra. They are required to be closed in the [[weak operator topology]], which is weaker than the norm topology.\n\nThe [[Sherman\u2013Takeda theorem]] implies that any C*-algebra has a universal enveloping W*-algebra, such that any homomorphism to a W*-algebra factors through it.\n\n== Type for C*-algebras ==\nA C*-algebra ''A'' is of type I if and only if for all non-degenerate representations \u03c0 of ''A'' the von Neumann algebra \u03c0(''A'')\u2032\u2032 (that is, the bicommutant of \u03c0(''A'')) is a type I von Neumann algebra. In fact it is sufficient to consider only factor representations, i.e. representations \u03c0 for which \u03c0(''A'')\u2032\u2032 is a factor.\n\nA locally compact group is said to be of type I if and only if its [[group C^*-algebra|group C*-algebra]] is type I.\n\nHowever, if a C*-algebra has non-type I representations, then by results of [[James Glimm]] it also has representations of type II and type III. Thus for C*-algebras and locally compact groups, it is only meaningful to speak of type I and non type I properties.\n\n== C*-algebras and quantum field theory ==\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], one typically describes a physical system with a C*-algebra ''A'' with unit element; the self-adjoint elements of ''A'' (elements ''x'' with ''x*'' = ''x'') are thought of as the ''observables'', the measurable quantities, of the system. A ''state'' of the system is defined as a positive functional on ''A'' (a '''C'''-linear map \u03c6 : ''A'' \u2192 '''C''' with \u03c6(''u*u'') \u2265 0 for all ''u'' \u2208 ''A'') such that \u03c6(1) = 1. The expected value of the observable ''x'', if the system is in state \u03c6, is then \u03c6(''x'').\n\nThis C*-algebra approach is used in the Haag-Kastler axiomatization of [[local quantum field theory]], where every open set of [[Minkowski spacetime]] is associated with a C*-algebra.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Banach algebra]]\n* [[Star-algebra|*-algebra]]\n* [[Hilbert C*-module]]\n* [[Operator K-theory]]\n* [[Operator system]], a unital subspace of a C*-algebra that is *-closed.\n* [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark\u2013Segal construction]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{citation|first=W.|last=Arveson|authorlink=William Arveson|title=An Invitation to C*-Algebra|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1976|isbn=0-387-90176-0}}.

Croydon was served by the [[Surrey Iron Railway]], the first public railway (horse drawn) in the world, in 1803, and by the [[Brighton Main Line|London to Brighton]] rail link in the mid-19th century, helping it to become the largest town in what was then [[Surrey]].<ref name=\"Croyweb History\"/>\n\nIn the 20th century Croydon became known for industries such as metal working, car manufacture and its aerodrome, [[Croydon Airport]]. Starting out during World War I as an airfield for protection against [[Zeppelin]]s, an adjacent airfield was combined, and the new aerodrome opened on 29 March 1920. It became the largest in London, and was the main terminal for international air freight into the capital. It developed into one of the great airports of the world during the 1920s and 1930s, and welcomed the world's pioneer aviators in its heyday.<ref name=\"Battle book\">{{cite book|last=Cluett|first=Douglas|author2=Joanna Bogle |author3=Bob Learmonth |title=Croydon Airport and The Battle for Britain|year=1984|location=London Borough of Sutton Libraries and Arts Services|isbn=0-907335-11-X}}</ref> [[British Airways Ltd]] used the airport for a short period after redirecting from [[RAF Northolt|Northolt Aerodrome]], and Croydon was the operating base for [[Imperial Airways]]. It was partly due to the airport that Croydon suffered heavy bomb damage during World War II. As aviation technology progressed, however, and aircraft became larger and more numerous, it was recognised in 1952 that the airport would be too small to cope with the ever-increasing volume of air traffic. The last scheduled flight departed on 30 September 1959. It was superseded as the main airport by both [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] and [[London Gatwick Airport]] (see below). The air terminal, now known as Airport House, has been restored, and has a hotel and museum in it.<ref name=\"Croyweb History\"/>\n\nIn the late 1950s and through the 1960s the council commercialised the centre of Croydon with massive development of office blocks and the [[Whitgift Centre]] which was formerly the biggest in-town shopping centre in Europe.<ref name=\"urbanisation\">{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://usj.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/43/13/2399|title=Modernism vs Urban Renaissance: Negotiating Post-war Heritage in English City Centres|publisher=Urban Studies Journal|accessdate=5 June 2008}}</ref> The centre was officially opened in October 1970 by the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]].

If it had been successful, it would have been the third local authority in [[Greater London]] to hold that status, along with the ''[[City of London]]'' and the ''[[City of Westminster]]''. At present the London Borough of Croydon is the second most populous [[Local government district]] of England without city status, [[Kirklees]] being the first.

There is a Shadow Cabinet drawn from the sole opposition party. A backbench cross-party scrutiny and overview committee is in place to hold the executive cabinet to account.\n\nFrom the borough's creation in 1965 until 1994 the council saw continuous control under first Conservatives and Residents' Ratepayers councillors up to 1986 and then Conservatives. From 1994 to 2006 [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] councillors controlled the council. After a further eight-year period of Conservative control the Labour group secured a ten-seat majority in the local council elections on 22 May 2014. Councillor Tony Newman returned to lead the council for Labour.\n\nIn the 2014 local elections the Labour party gained all the seats in the Ashburton and Waddon wards and gained the one seat held by the Conservatives in the New Addington ward. The election marked the first time that Ashburton ward had been represented by Labour. Elected as a Labour councillor in Waddon was Croydon Central's previous Conservative then Independent MP and leader of the Conservatives on Croydon council up to 2005, Andrew Pelling.\n\nAt the [[Croydon Council election, 2010|2010 Croydon local elections]] seats lost previously in Addiscombe, South Norwood and Upper Norwood were retaken by Labour Party councillors; in New Addington the Conservative party gained a councillor, the first time that the Conservatives had taken a seat there since 1968.

Former Croydon councillors include former MPs [[Andrew Pelling]], [[Vivian Bendall]], [[David Congdon]], [[Geraint Davies (Labour politician)|Geraint Davies]] and [[Reg Prentice]], [[London Assembly]] member [[Valerie Shawcross]], [[Peter Spencer Bowness|Lord Bowness]], [[John Donaldson, Baron Donaldson of Lymington]] ([[Master of the Rolls]]) and [[H.T. Muggeridge]], MP and father of [[Malcolm Muggeridge]]. The first Mayor of the newly created [[county borough]] was [[Jabez Balfour]], later a disgraced Member of Parliament. Former Conservative Director of Campaigning, [[Gavin Barwell]], was a Croydon councillor between 1998 and 2010 and was the MP for Croydon Central from 2010 until 2017. [[Sarah Jones (politician)]] won the Croydon Central seat for Labour in 2017.  Croydon North has a Labour MP, [[Steve Reed (politician)]], and Croydon South has a Conservative MP, [[Chris Philp]].\n \nSome 10,000 people work directly or indirectly for the council, at its main offices at Bernard Weatherill House or in its schools, care homes, housing offices or work depots. The council is generally well regarded, having made important improvements in education and social services. However, there have been concerns over benefits, leisure services and waste collection. Although the council has one of London's lower rates of council tax, there are claims{{who|date=December 2017}} that it is too high and that resources are wasted.\n\nThe [[Mayors in England|Mayor of Croydon]] for 2010-11 was Councillor Avril Slipper. The Leader is Cllr Mike Fisher and the Deputy Leaders are Cllr Tim Pollard and Cllr Dudley Mead. The Chief Executive since 7 July 2007 has been Jon Rouse.{{Fix|text=out of date?}}\n\n===Government buildings===\n[[File:Croydon clocktower.jpg|thumb|Croydon's Victorian Town Hall]]\n[[Croydon Clocktower|Croydon Town Hall]] on Katharine Street in [[Croydon|Central Croydon]] houses the committee rooms, the mayor's and other councillors' offices, electoral services and the arts and heritage services.\nThe present Town Hall is Croydon's third. The first town hall is thought to have been built in either 1566 or 1609.<ref name=\"Croydon Town Hall\">{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/town_hall.asp|title=Katharine Street, Town Hall: Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=10 October 2007}}</ref> The second was built in 1808 to serve the growing town but was demolished after the present town hall was erected in 1895.\n\nThe 1808 building cost \u00a38,000, which was regarded as an enormous sum for those days and was perhaps as controversial as the administrative building Bernard Weatherill House opened for occupation in 2013 and reputed to have cost \u00a3220,000,000. The early 19th century building was known initially as \"Courthouse\" as, like its predecessor and successor, the local court met there. The building stood on the western side of the High Street near to the junction with Surrey Street, the location of the town's market. The building became inadequate for the growing local administrative responsibilities and stood at a narrow point of a High Street in need of widening.\n\nThe present town hall was designed by local architect Charles Henman<ref name=\"Croydon Town Hall\"/> and was officially opened by the Prince and [[Queen Alexandra|Princess of Wales]] on 19 May 1896. It was constructed in red brick, sourced from [[Wrotham]] in Kent, with [[Portland stone]] dressings and green [[Westmorland|Westmoreland]] [[slate]]s for the roof. It also housed the court and most central council employees.\n\nThe Borough's incorporation in 1883 and a desire to improve central Croydon with improvements to traffic flows and the removal of social deprivation in Middle Row prompted the move to a new configuration of town hall provision. The second closure of the Central Railway Station provided the Corporation with the opportunity to buy the station land from the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company for \u00a311,500 to provide the site for the new town hall. Indeed, the council hoped to be able to sell on some of the land purchased with enough for municipal needs and still \"leave a considerable margin of land which might be disposed of\". The purchase of the failed railway station came despite local leaders having successfully urged the re-opening of the poorly patronised railway station. The railway station re-opening had failed to be a success so freeing up the land for alternative use.\n\nParts, including the former court rooms, have been converted into the [[Museum of Croydon]] and exhibition galleries. The original public library was converted into the [[David Lean Cinema]], part of the [[Croydon Clocktower]]. The Braithwaite Hall is used for events and performances. The town hall was renovated in the mid-1990s and the imposing central staircase, long closed to the public and kept for councillors only, was re-opened in 1994. The civic complex, meanwhile, was substantially added to, with buildings across Mint Walk and the 19-floor Taberner House to house the rapidly expanding corporation's employees.\n\n[[File:CroydonTabHouse.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Croydon Council's offices were in [[Taberner House]] until September 2013]]\n[[Ruskin House]] is the headquarters of Croydon's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], Trade Union and [[Co-operative Party|Co-operative]] movements and is itself a co-operative with shareholders from organisations across the three movements. In the 19th century, Croydon was a bustling commercial centre of London. It was said that, at the turn of the 20th century, approximately \u00a310,000 was spent in Croydon's taverns and inns every week. For the early labour movement, then, it was natural to meet in the town's public houses, in this environment. However, the temperance movement was equally strong, and [[Georgina King Lewis]], a keen member of the [[Croydon United Temperance Council]], took it upon herself to establish a dry centre for the labour movement. The first Ruskin House was highly successful, and there has been two more since.<ref name=\"Ruskin House\">This text was taken, with permission, from ''Ruskin House: A History'', M. Tiedemann & E.

Today, Ruskin House continues to serve as the headquarters of the Trade Union, Labour and Co-operative movements in Croydon, hosting a range of meetings and being the base for several labour movement groups. Office tenants include the headquarters of the [[Communist Party of Britain]] and Croydon Labour Party.

Thornley, with Allan Holt and Hugh Lea as borough engineers. Although the council had needed extra space since the 1920s, it was only with the imminent creation of the London Borough of Croydon that action was taken. The building, being demolished in 2014, was in classic 1960s style, praised at the time but subsequently much derided. It has its elegant upper slab block narrowing towards both ends, a formal device which has been compared to the famous [[Pirelli Tower]] in Milan. It was named after Ernest Taberner OBE, Town Clerk from 1937 to 1963.<ref name=\"Taberner House names\">{{cite web|year=2005|url=http://www.croydononline.org/history/heritage/taberner_house.asp|title=Park Lane, Taberner House:Heritage Pages|publisher=Croydon Online|accessdate=10 October 2007}}</ref> Until September 2013, Taberner House housed most of the council's central employees and was the main location for the public to access information and services, particularly with respect to housing.\n\nIn September 2013, Council staff moved into [[Bernard Weatherill House]] in Fell Road, (named after the former Speaker of the House and Member of Parliament for Croydon North-East). Staff from the Met Police, NHS, Jobcentre Plus, Croydon Credit Union, Citizens Advice Bureau as well as 75 services from the council all moved to the new building.\n\n==Geography and climate==\nThe borough is in the far south of London, with the [[M25 motorway|M25 orbital motorway]] stretching to the south of it, between Croydon and [[Tandridge (district)|Tandridge]]. To the north and east, the borough mainly borders the [[London Borough of Bromley]], and in the north west the boroughs of [[London Borough of Lambeth|Lambeth]] and [[London Borough of Southwark|Southwark]]. The boroughs of [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]] are located directly to the west.

It lies {{convert|10|mi|km}} south of Central London, and the earliest settlement may have been a Roman staging post on the London-Portslade road, although conclusive evidence has not yet been found. The main town centre houses a great variety of well-known stores on [[North End, Croydon|North End]] and two shopping centres. It was pedestrianised in 1989 to attract people back to the town centre.

The [[Great North Wood]] is a former natural oak forest that covered the [[Sydenham|Sydenham Ridge]] and the southern reaches of the [[River Effra]] and its tributaries.

The tower was originally nicknamed the ''Threepenny bit building'', as it resembles a stack of pre-decimalisation [[Threepence (British coin)|Threepence]] coins, which were 12-sided. It is now most commonly called The Octagon, being 8-sided.\n\n[[Lunar House]] is another high-rise building. Like other government office buildings on Wellesley Road, such as '''[[Apollo House (Croydon)|Apollo House]]''', the name of the building was inspired by the [[Project Apollo|US moon landings]] (In the Croydon suburb of New Addington there is a [[public house]], built during the same period, called ''The Man '''on''' the Moon''). Lunar House houses the Home Office building for Visas and Immigration. Apollo House houses The Border Patrol Agency.\n\nA new generation of buildings are being considered by the council as part of [[Croydon Vision 2020]], so that the borough doesn't lose its title of having the \"largest office space in the south east\", excluding central London.<ref>{{cite web|title=Croydon Gateway - Arrowcroft Scheme|publisher=Emporis|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/bu/nc/ne/?id=101018|accessdate=12 October 2007}}</ref> Projects such as [[Wellesley Square]], which will be a mix of residential and retail with an eye-catching colour design and [[100 George Street]] a proposed modern office block are incorporated in this vision.\n\nNotable events that have happened to Croydon's skyline include the Millennium project to create the largest single urban lighting project ever. It was created for the buildings of Croydon to illuminate them for the third millennium. Not only did this project give new lighting to the buildings, but it provided an opportunity to project onto them images and words, mixing art and poetry with coloured light, and also displaying public information after dark. Apart from increasing night time activity in Croydon and thereby reducing the fear of crime, it helped to promote the sustainable use of older buildings by displaying them in a more positive way.<ref name=\"skyline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&id=38&t=2|title=Croydon Skyline|accessdate=12 October 2007|publisher=Millennium Commission|year=2003|work=Croydon Skyline Millennium Trust|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031104234739/http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&id=38&t=2|archivedate=4 November 2003|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\n{{Historical populations\n|type = UK\n|title = Population\n|footnote = Source: [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data_cube_table_page.jsp?data_theme=T_POP&data_cube=N_TPop&u_id=10192973&c_id=10001043&add=N ''A Vision of Britain through time'']\n\n|1801 |6742\n|1811 |8911\n|1821 |10567\n|1831 |14031\n|1841 |18638\n|1851 |21849\n|1861 |42197\n|1871 |62545\n|1881 |82893\n|1891 |108339\n|1901 |141918\n|1911 |185914\n|1921 |221692\n|1931 |264358\n|1941 |281273\n|1951 |299271\n|1961 |316084\n|1971 |333942\n|1981 |316296\n|1991 |319218\n|2001 |330688\n|2011 |363378\n|2013 |372759\n}}\n\nAccording to the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], Croydon had a population of 363,378, making Croydon the most populated borough in [[Greater London|Greater London]].

It was constructed in the 1960s as part of a planned ring road for Croydon<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/croydonringroad/|title=CBRD - In Depth - Croydon Ring Road|accessdate=9 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619132406/http://www.cbrd.co.uk/indepth/croydonringroad/|archive-date=19 June 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and includes an [[Croydon Underpass|underpass]], which allows traffic to avoid going into the town centre.\n\nThe hilly topography of Croydon and the lack of underground services in that part of South London is a reason for the extensive suburban and inter-urban railway network. Croydon is in the commuter belt to London as part of suburbia. There are several busy local rail routes running along the borough's towns, connecting it with [[London Bridge station|London Bridge]] and [[London Victoria]]. These local routes mainly run on the [[Brighton Main Line]] and [[Sutton & Mole Valley Lines]]. As well as the main stations of East Croydon and West Croydon, there are several suburban stations at [[Norwood Junction railway station|Norwood Junction]], [[Purley railway station|Purley]], [[Coulsdon South railway station|Coulsdon South]] and [[Kenley railway station|Kenley]] and more.\n\n[[File:Addington Village bus and tram station.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Tramlink]] at Addington Interchange]]\nThe light rail system ''[[Tramlink]]'' (Operated by [[Tramtrack Croydon]], a wholly owned subsidiary of Transport for London),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |title=TfL announces plans to take over Tramlink services |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=24 May 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412011803/http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/7741.aspx |archivedate=12 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> opened in 2000, serves the borough and surrounding areas. Its network consists of three lines, from [[Elmers End]] to West Croydon, from [[Beckenham]] to West Croydon, and from [[New Addington]] to [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]], with all three lines running via the Croydon loop on which it is centred. It has been highly successful, environmentally-friendly and a reliable light rail system carrying around 22 million passengers a year. It is also the only tram system in London but there is another light rail system [[Docklands Light Railway|in the Docklands]]. It serves [[Mitcham]], [[Woodside, London|Woodside]], [[Addiscombe]] and the [[Purley Way]] retail and industrial area amongst others. An extension to [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] is currently being developed by Transport for London with the support of the council and the South London Partnership. This would improve public transport access to [[Upper Norwood]] and [[Crystal Palace Park]] and help to stimulate regeneration across the wider area. The extension could be in service by 2013. Other possible extensions include [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], a new park and ride close to the M25, [[Coulsdon]], [[Purley, London|Purley]], [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Tolworth]], [[Tooting]], [[Brixton]] for an interchange with the proposed [[Cross River Tram]], [[Bromley]] and [[Lewisham]] for an interchange with the Docklands Light Railway.\n\nA sizeable bus infrastructure which is part of the [[London Buses]] network operates from a main hub at [[West Croydon station]]. The bus station at [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]] is undergoing a major re-development to make it more modern and future-proof. There are also plans to create a new bus terminal at [[Park Place (Croydon)|Park Place]] if the shopping centre is built. [[Addington Interchange]] is a regional bus terminal in [[Addington, London|Addington Village]] which has an interchange between [[Tramlink]] and bus services in the remote area. [[Arriva London]], part of [[Arriva]], is one of the largest bus operators to serve Croydon along with [[Metrobus (South East England)|Metrobus]], [[Selkent]], and [[Travel London|National Express London]]. Unlike other places in the country, London's transport infrastructure is regulated and therefore is not subject to price wars between different companies with TfL setting a standard price for bus services which is currently set at 90p with an [[Oyster card]]. Services include buses to central London, Purley Way, Bromley, Lewisham and a number of other [[civic centre]]s in the south. [[London Buses route X26]], the longest route in London, provides services to Heathrow Airport via [[Richmond station (London)|Richmond]] and Sutton.\n\nAlthough hilly, Croydon is compact and has few major trunk roads running through it. It is on one of the [[Connect2]] schemes which are part of the [[National Cycle Network]] route running around [[Croydon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sustransconnect2.org.uk/schemes/project_detail.php?id=147|title=London - Croydon Park Links|year=2008|accessdate=24 May 2008}}</ref> The [[North Downs]], an area of outstanding natural beauty popular with both on- and off-road cyclists, is so close to Croydon that part of the park lies within the borough boundary, and there are routes into the park almost from the civic centre.\n\nFollowing the extension of the [[East London Line]] in 2010, two stations in Croydon are now served by [[London Overground]] services; [[Norwood Junction]] and [[West Croydon station|West Croydon]].

There are different definitions used in [[group theory]] and [[ring theory]].\n\n== Group theory ==\nThe '''commutator''' of two elements, {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}}, of a [[group (mathematics)|group]] {{mvar|G}}, is the element\n: {{math|[''g'', ''h''] {{=}} ''g''<sup>\u22121</sup>''h''<sup>\u22121</sup>''gh''}}.\n\nIt is equal to the group's identity if and only if {{mvar|g}} and {{mvar|h}} commute (i.e., if and only if {{math|''gh'' {{=}} ''hg''}}). The [[subgroup]] of ''G'' [[Generating set of a group|generated]] by all commutators is called the ''derived group'' or the ''[[commutator subgroup]]'' of ''G''. Note that one must consider the subgroup generated by the set of commutators because in general the set of commutators is not closed under the group operation. Commutators are used to define [[nilpotent group|nilpotent]] and [[solvable group|solvable]] groups.\n\nThe above definition of the commutator is used by some group theorists, as well as throughout this article. However, many other group theorists define the commutator as\n:{{math|[''g'', ''h''] {{=}} ''ghg''<sup>\u22121</sup>''h''<sup>\u22121</sup>}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=108}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Herstein|1975|p=65}}</ref>\n\n=== Identities (group theory) ===\nCommutator identities are an important tool in [[group theory]].<ref>{{harvtxt|McKay|2000|p=4}}</ref> The expression {{math|''a<sup>x</sup>''}} denotes the [[conjugate (group theory)#Definition|conjugate]] of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|x}}, defined as {{math|''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>''ax''}}.\n\n# <math>x^y = x[x, y].</math>\n# <math>[y, x] = [x,y]^{-1}.</math>\n# <math>[x, zy] = [x, y]\\cdot [x, z]^y</math> and <math>[x z, y] = [x, y]^z \\cdot [z, y].</math>\n# <math>\\left[x, y^{-1}\\right] = [y, x]^{y^{-1}}</math> and <math>\\left[x^{-1}, y\\right] = [y, x]^{x^{-1}}.</math>\n# <math>\\left[\\left[x, y^{-1}\\right], z\\right]^y \\cdot \\left[\\left[y, z^{-1}\\right], x\\right]^z \\cdot \\left[\\left[z, x^{-1}\\right], y\\right]^x = 1</math> and <math>\\left[\\left[x, y\\right], z^x\\right] \\cdot  \\left[[z ,x], y^z\\right] \\cdot \\left[[y, z], x^y\\right] = 1.</math>\n\nIdentity (5) is also known as the ''Hall\u2013Witt identity'', after [[Philip Hall]] and [[Ernst Witt]].  It is a group-theoretic analogue of the [[Jacobi identity]] for the ring-theoretic commutator (see next section).\n\nN.B., the above definition of the conjugate of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|x}} is used by some group theorists.<ref>{{harvtxt|Herstein|1975|p=83}}</ref>  Many other group theorists define the conjugate of {{mvar|a}} by {{mvar|x}} as {{math|''xax<sup>\u22121</sup>''}}.<ref>{{harvtxt|Fraleigh|1976|p=128}}</ref>  This is often written <math>{}^x a</math>.  Similar identities hold for these conventions.\n\nMany identities are used that are true modulo certain subgroups.  These can be particularly useful in the study of [[solvable group]]s and [[nilpotent group]]s.  For instance, in any group, second powers behave well:\n:<math>(xy)^2 = x^2 y^2 [y, x][[y, x], y].</math>\n\nIf the [[derived subgroup]] is central, then\n:<math>(xy)^n = x^n y^n [y, x]^\\binom{n}{2}.</math>\n\n== Ring theory ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Lie algebra]] -->\nThe '''commutator''' of two elements ''a'' and ''b'' of a [[ring (algebra)|ring]] or an [[associative algebra]] is defined by\n: <math>[a, b] = ab - ba.</math>\n\nIt is zero if and only if ''a'' and ''b'' commute. In [[linear algebra]], if two [[endomorphism]]s of a space are represented by commuting matrices in terms of one basis, then they are so represented in terms of every basis. By using the commutator as a [[Lie algebra|Lie bracket]], every associative algebra can be turned into a [[Lie algebra]].\n\nThe '''anticommutator''' of two elements {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} of a ring or an associative algebra is defined by\n: <math>\\{a, b\\} = ab + ba.</math>\n\nSometimes the brackets [ ]<sub>+</sub> are also used to denote anticommutators, while [ ]<sub>\u2212</sub> is then used for commutators.<ref>{{harvtxt|McMahon|2008}}</ref> The anticommutator is used less often than the commutator, but can be used, for example, to define [[Clifford algebra]]s, [[Jordan algebra]]s and is utilized to derive the [[Dirac equation]] in particle physics.\n\nThe commutator of two operators acting on a [[Hilbert space]] is a central concept in [[quantum mechanics]], since it quantifies how well the two [[observable]]s described by these operators can be measured simultaneously.

The word ''cairn'' comes from the {{lang-gd|c\u00e0rn}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8k\u02b0a\u02d0r\u02e0n\u032a\u02e0||}} (plural {{lang|gd|c\u00e0irn}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8k\u02b0a\u02d0r\u02e0\u0272||}}).<ref>Peter Drummond, ''Scottish Hill Names'', Scottish Mountaineering Trust (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-907521-95-2}}, page 25</ref>\n\nCairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present.\n\nIn [[modern time]]s, cairns are often erected as [[landmark]]s, a use they have had since [[ancient times]]. However, since [[prehistory]], they have also been built and used as [[Sepulchre|burial]] monuments; for defense and hunting; for ceremonial purposes, sometimes relating to  [[astronomy]]; to locate buried items, such as caches of food or objects; and to mark trails, among other purposes.\n\n[[File:Cairn Northumberland and Durham.jpg|thumb|Cairn at the boundary of Counties Durham and Northumberland UK]]\n\nCairns are used as [[Trail blazing|trail markers]] in many parts of the world, in [[Upland (geology)|uplands]], on  [[moorland]],   on  [[Summit (topography)|mountaintops]], near [[waterway]]s and on [[sea cliff]]s, as well as in barren [[desert]]s and [[tundra]]. They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of [[megalith]]ic engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, whether for increased visibility or for religious reasons. An ancient example is the [[inuksuk]] (plural inuksuit), used by the [[Inuit]], [[Inupiat]], [[Kalaallit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], and other peoples of the [[Arctic]] region of North America.  Inuksuit are found from [[Alaska]] to [[Greenland]]. This region, above the [[Arctic Circle]], is dominated by the tundra [[biome]] and has areas with few natural [[landmark]]s.\n\n==Modern cairns==\n[[File:Lion's Head snow.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Line of cairns used to mark the way above the treeline on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington, New Hampshire]], US]]\nDifferent types of cairns exist from rough piles of stones to interlocking dry stone round cylinders.  The most important cairns commonly used around the world are interlocking stone survey cairns constructed around a central survey mark about every 30&nbsp;km on the tallest peaks across a nation. These physical survey mark cairn systems are the basis for national survey grids to interconnect individual land survey measurements for entire nations. On occasion these permanent interlocking stone cairns are taken down then reconstructed to re-mark measurements to increase the accuracy of the national survey grid. They can also be used in unpopulated countries as emergency location points.  In [[North America]] and [[Northern Europe]] any type of cairn can be used to mark [[mountain bike]] and [[hiking trail]]s and other cross-country [[trail blazing]], especially in mountain regions at or above the [[tree line]]. For example, the extensive trail network maintained by the DNT, the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]], extensively uses cairns in conjunction with T-painted rock faces to mark trails.  Other examples of these can be seen in the lava fields of [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Volcanoes National Park]] to mark several hikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/hike_bc.htm |title=Backcountry Hikes - Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}</ref> Placed at regular intervals, a series of cairns can be used to indicate a path across stony or barren terrain, even across [[glacier]]s. Such cairns are often placed at junctions or in places where the trail direction is not obvious. They may also be used to indicate an obscured danger such as a sudden drop, or a noteworthy point such as the summit of a mountain.  Most trail cairns are small, usually being a foot or less in height. However, they may be built taller so as to protrude through a layer of snow. Hikers passing by often add a stone, as a small bit of maintenance to counteract the erosive effects of severe weather. North American trail marks are sometimes called \"ducks\" or \"duckies\", because they sometimes have a \"beak\" pointing in the direction of the route. The expression \"two rocks do not make a duck\" reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.\n\nThe building of cairns for recreational purposes along trails, to mark one's personal passage through the area, can result in an overabundance of rock piles. This distracts from cairns used as genuine navigational guides, and also conflicts with the [[Leave No Trace]] ethic. This ethic of outdoor practice advocates for leaving the outdoors undisturbed and in its natural condition.\n[[File:Isandlwanamassgrave.JPG|left|thumb|200px|One of many cairns marking British mass graves at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] (1879), [[South Africa]]]]\nCoastal cairns, or \"sea marks\", are also common in the northern latitudes, especially in the island-strewn waters of [[Scandinavia]] and eastern [[Canada]]. Often indicated on navigation charts, they may be painted white or lit as beacons for greater visibility offshore.\n\nModern cairns may also be erected for historical or memorial commemoration or simply for decorative or artistic reasons. One example is a series of many cairns marking [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers' [[mass graves]] at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]]. Another is the [[Matthew Flinders]] Cairn on the side of [[Arthur's Seat, Victoria|Arthur's Seat]], a small mountain on the shores of [[Port Phillip Bay]], [[Australia]]. A large cairn, commonly referred to as \"the igloo\" by the locals, was built atop a hill next to the [[I-476]] highway in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]] and is a part of a series of large rock sculptures initiated in 1988 to symbolize the township's [[Wales|Welsh]] heritage and to beautify the visual imagery along the highway.<ref>[http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 Radnor Township website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820120212/http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 |date=2007-08-20 }}, Gateway Enhancement Strategy.</ref> Some are merely places where farmers have collected stones removed from a field. These can be seen in the [[Catskill Mountains]], [[North America]] where there is a strong Scottish heritage, and may also represent places where livestock were lost. In locales exhibiting fantastic rock formations, such as the [[Grand Canyon]], tourists often construct simple cairns in reverence of the larger counterparts.<ref>[[:commons:File:Cairns at Grand Canyon North Rim 2013.jpg]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}</ref> By contrast, cairns may have a strong aesthetic purpose, for example in the art of [[Andy Goldsworthy]].\n\n===Illegal construction===\nNorwegian authorities said in 2015 that illegal cairns are being built each year, to a large degree by tourists to Norway; part of the problem is that individual stones are being removed from registered- and unregistered ''kulturminner'' (e.g., historical monuments).<ref>[http://www.nrk.no/finnmark/_-ulovlige-varder-er-blitt-en-farsott-1.12499962 \u2013 Ulovlige varder er blitt en farsott] [\u2013 Illegal cairns have become a craze]</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Europe===\nThe building of cairns for various purposes goes back into [[prehistory]] in [[Eurasia]], ranging in size from small rock sculptures to substantial man-made hills of stone (some built on top of larger, natural hills). The latter are often relatively massive [[Bronze Age]] or earlier structures which, like kistvaens and [[dolmen]]s, frequently contain burials; they are comparable to [[Tumulus|tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]s), but of stone construction instead of [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. ''Cairn'' originally could more broadly refer to various types of hills and natural stone piles, but today is used exclusively of artificial ones.\n[[File:Cairn Gavrinis exterieur.jpg|thumb|Cairn of the [[Neolithic]]-era [[passage grave]] on [[Gavrinis]] island, [[Brittany]]]]\nThe word ''cairn'' derives from [[Scots language|Scots]] {{lang|gd|cairn}} (with the same meaning), in turn from [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|c\u00e0rn}}, which is essentially the same as the corresponding words in other native [[Celtic language]]s of [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]], including [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|carn}} (and {{lang|cy|carnedd}}), [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|karn}}, [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|carn}}, and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] {{lang|kw|karn}} or {{lang|kw|carn}}.  Cornwall ({{lang|kw|Kernow}}) itself may actually be named after the cairns that dot its landscape, such as Cornwall's highest point, [[Brown Willy Cairns|Brown Willy Summit Cairn]], a 5&nbsp;m (16&nbsp;ft) high and 24&nbsp;m (79&nbsp;ft) diameter mound atop [[Brown Willy]] hill in [[Bodmin Moor]], an area with many ancient cairns.  Burial cairns and other [[megalith]]s are the subject of a variety of legends and folklore throughout Britain and Ireland. In [[Scotland]], it is traditional to carry a stone up from the bottom of a hill to place on a cairn at its top. In such a fashion, cairns would grow ever larger. An old Scottish Gaelic blessing is {{lang|gd|Cuiridh mi clach air do ch\u00e0rn}}, \"I'll put a stone on your stone\".  In Highland folklore it is recounted that before Highland clans fought in a battle, each man would place a stone in a pile. Those who survived the battle returned and removed a stone from the pile. The stones that remained were built into a cairn to honour the dead. Cairns in the region were also put to vital practical use. For example, [[D\u00fan Aonghasa]], an all-stone [[Iron Age]] Irish [[hill fort]] on [[Inishmore]] in the [[Aran Islands]], is still surrounded by small cairns and strategically placed jutting rocks, used collectively as an alternative to [[Defensive wall|defensive earthworks]] because of the [[karst]] landscape's lack of soil.\n[[File:BorderPost272 - Norway and Sweden.jpg|thumb|The [[Stone Cairn (Riksr\u00f6sen)|Riksr\u00f6sen]] divide Norway and Sweden.]]\nIn [[Scandinavia]], cairns have been used for centuries as trail and sea marks, among other purposes. In [[Iceland]], cairns were often used as markers along the numerous single-file roads or paths that crisscrossed the island; many of these ancient cairns are still standing, although the paths have disappeared. In [[Norse Greenland]], cairns were used as a hunting implement, a game-driving \"lane\", used to direct reindeer towards a [[game jump]].<ref>Arneborg 2004</ref>\n\nIn the mythology of ancient Greece, cairns were associated with [[Hermes]], the god of overland travel. According to one legend, Hermes was put on trial by [[Hera]] for slaying her favorite servant, the monster [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. All of the other gods acted as a jury, and as a way of declaring their verdict they were given pebbles, and told to throw them at whichever person they deemed to be in the right, Hermes or Hera. Hermes argued so skillfully that he ended up buried under a heap of pebbles, and this was the first cairn.\nIn [[Croatia]], in areas of ancient [[Dalmatia]], such as [[Herzegovina]] and the [[Krajina]], they are known as ''gromila''.\n\nIn [[Portugal]] a cairn is called  a {{lang|pt|moledro}}. In a legend the moledros are enchanted soldiers, and if one stone is taken from the pile and put under a pillow, in the morning a soldier will appear for a brief moment, then will change back to a stone and magically return to the pile.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Gen\u00e9tica e a Teoria da Continuidade Paleol\u00edtica aplicada \u00e0 Lenda da Funda\u00e7\u00e3o de Portugal e Esc\u00f3cia Apenas Livros|year=2008|isbn=978-989-618-180-2|url=http://www.continuitas.org/texts/morais_genetica.pdf|language=pt}}</ref> The cairns that mark the place where someone died or cover the graves alongside the roads where in the past people were buried are called {{lang|pt|Fi\u00e9is de Deus}}.

A reminder of the [[desertification]] of the area is provided by [[megalith]]ic remains, which occur in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands: cairns (''kerkour''), [[dolmen]]s and circles like [[Stonehenge]], underground cells excavated in rock, [[Long barrow|barrows]] topped with huge slabs, and step [[pyramid]]-like mounds.\n\n===Asia and the Pacific===\nStarting in the [[Bronze Age]],{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=WHERE?!? \"Asia\" is huge.}} burial [[cist]]s were sometimes interred into cairns, which would be situated in conspicuous positions, often on the skyline above the village of the deceased. The stones may have been thought to deter grave robbers and scavengers. A more sinister explanation is that they were to [[Revenant (folklore)|stop the dead from rising]]. There remains a [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition of placing small stones on a person's grave as a token of respect, though this is generally to relate the longevity of stone to the eternal nature of the soul and is not usually done in a cairn fashion. [[Stupa]]s in India and [[Tibet]] probably started out in a similar fashion, although they now generally contain the ashes of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] saint or [[lama]].\n\n[[File:TallOvoo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Mongolian ceremonial cairn (''[[ovoo]]'')]]A traditional and often decorated, heap-formed cairn called an ''[[ovoo]]'' is made in [[Mongolia]].

This tradition has its roots in the worship of San-shin, or Mountain Spirit, so often still revered in Korean culture.<ref name=\"san\">{{cite book | title=Spirit of the Mountains - Korea's San-Shin and Traditions of Mountain Worship| last=Mason| first=David| year=1999| page=41| publisher=Hollym International Corp.| location=Seoul, South Korea and Elizabeth, New Jersey| isbn=1-56591-107-5}}</ref>\n\n===The Americas===\n[[File:Flag of Nunavut.svg|thumb|An inuksuk on the [[flag of Nunavut]]]]\nThroughout what today are the [[continental United States]] and Canada, cairns still mark [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]' game-driving \"lanes\" leading to [[buffalo jump]]s, some of which may date to 12,000 years ago.\nNatives of arctic North America (i.e. northern Canada, [[Alaska]] and indigenous [[Greenland]]) have built carefully constructed cairns and stone sculptures, called by names such as [[Inuksuk|{{lang|iu|inuksuit|nocat=yes}} and {{lang|iu|inunnguat|nocat=yes}}]], as landmarks and directional markers since [[European colonization of the Americas|before contact with Europeans]]. They are iconic of the region (an {{lang|iu|inuksuk}} even features on the flag of the Canadian far-northeastern territory, [[Nunavut]]), and are increasingly used as a symbol of Canadian national identity. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn North America, cairns are often [[petroform]]s in the shapes of turtles or other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}\n\nCairns have been used since [[pre-Columbian]] times throughout what is now [[Latin America]] to mark trails. Even today, in the [[Andes]] of [[South America]], the [[Quechuan]] peoples use cairns as religious shrines to the indigenous [[Inca]] goddess [[Pachamama]]. This is often part of a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] form of [[Roman Catholicism]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n{{clear|left}}\n\n==Anthropomorphism==\nAlthough the practice is not common in [[Modern English language|English]], cairns are sometimes referred to by their [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities. In [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a cairn is known as {{lang|de|steinmann}} and {{lang|nl|steenman}} respectively, meaning literally \"stone man\".  A form of the [[Inuit]] {{lang|iu|[[inuksuk]]}} is also meant to represent a human figure, and is called an {{lang|iu|inunguak}} (\"imitation of a person\"). In Italy, especially the [[Italian Alps]], a cairn is an {{lang|it|ometto}}, or a \"small man\".\n<!--Don't need this yet: {{clear|right}}-->\n\n==Sea cairns==\n[[File:Kummel Korpo 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sea mark]] in [[Finland|Finnish]] coastal waters]]\nCoastal cairns called [[sea mark]]s are also common in the northern latitudes, and are placed along shores and on islands and islets.

Examples of characteristic subgroups include the [[commutator subgroup]] and the [[center of a group]].\n\n== Definition ==\nA subgroup {{math|''H''}} of a group {{math|''G''}} is called '''characteristic subgroup''', {{math|''H'' char ''G''}}, if for every automorphism {{math|''\u03c6''}} of {{math|''G''}}, {{math|\u03c6[''H''] \u2264 ''H''}} holds, i.e. if every automorphism of the parent group maps the subgroup to within itself.\n\nEvery automorphism of {{math|''G''}} induces an automorphism of the quotient group, {{math|''G/H''}}, which yields a map {{math|Aut(''G'') \u2192 Aut(''G''/''H'')}}.\n\nIf {{math|''G''}} has a unique subgroup {{math|''H''}} of a given (finite) index, then {{math|''H''}} is characteristic in {{math|''G''}}.\n\n== Related concepts ==\n\n=== Normal subgroup ===\n{{main|Normal subgroup}}\nA subgroup of {{math|''H''}} that is invariant under all inner automorphisms is called [[normal subgroup|normal]]; also, an invariant subgroup.\n:{{math|\u03c6[''H''] \u2264 ''H'', \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 Inn(''G'')}}\n\nSince {{math|Inn(''G'') \u2286 Aut(''G'')}} and a characteristic subgroup is invariant under all automorphisms, every characteristic subgroup is normal. However, not every normal subgroup is characteristic.  Here are several examples:\n* Let {{math|''H''}} be a nontrivial group, and let {{math|''G''}} be the [[direct product of groups|direct product]], {{math|''H'' \u00d7 ''H''}}.  Then the subgroups, {{math|{1} \u00d7 ''H''}} and {{math|''H''  \u00d7 {1{{)}}}}, are both normal, but neither is characteristic.  In particular, neither of these subgroups is invariant under the automorphism, {{math|(''x'', ''y'') \u2192 (''y'', ''x'')}}, that switches the two factors.\n* For a concrete example of this, let {{math|''V''}} be the [[Klein four-group]] (which is [[group isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the direct product, {{math|[[cyclic group|\u2124{{sub|2}}]] \u00d7 \u2124{{sub|2}}}}).  Since this group is [[abelian group|abelian]], every subgroup is normal; but every permutation of the 3 non-identity elements is an automorphism of {{math|''V''}}, so the 3 subgroups of order 2 are not characteristic.  Here {{math|V {{=}} {''e'', ''a'', ''b'', ''ab''} }}. Consider {{math|H {{=}} {''e'', ''a''{{)}}}} and consider the automorphism, {{math|T(''e'') {{=}} ''e'', T(''a'') {{=}} ''b'', T(''b'') {{=}} ''a'', T(''ab'') {{=}} ''ab''}}; then {{math|T(''H'')}} is not contained in {{math|''H''}}.\n* In the [[quaternion group]] of order 8, each of the cyclic subgroups of order 4 is normal, but none of these are characteristic.  However, the subgroup, {{math|{1, \u22121{{)}}}}, is characteristic, since it is the only subgroup of order 2.\n* If {{math|''n''}} is even, the [[dihedral group]] of order {{math|2''n''}} has 3 subgroups of [[index of a subgroup|index]] 2, all of which are normal.  One of these is the cyclic subgroup, which is characteristic.  The other two subgroups are dihedral; these are permuted by an [[outer automorphism group|outer automorphism]] of the parent group, and are therefore not characteristic.\n\n=== Strictly characteristic subgroup{{anchor|Strictly invariant subgroup}} ===\nA ''{{vanchor|strictly characteristic subgroup}}'', or a ''{{vanchor|distinguished subgroup}}'', which is invariant under [[surjective]] [[endomorphism]]s. For [[finite group]]s, surjectivity implies injectivity, so a surjective endomorphism is an automorphism; thus being ''strictly characteristic'' is equivalent to ''characteristic''. This is not the case anymore for infinite groups.\n\n=== Fully characteristic subgroup{{anchor|Fully invariant subgroup}} ===\nFor an even stronger constraint, a ''fully characteristic subgroup'' (also, ''fully invariant subgroup''; cf. invariant subgroup), {{math|''H''}}, of a group, {{math|''G''}} is a group remaining [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under every endomorphism of {{math|''G''}}; that is,\n:{{math|\u03c6[''H''] \u2264 ''H'', \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 End(''G'')}}.\n\nEvery group has itself (the improper subgroup) and the trivial subgroup as two of its fully characteristic subgroups.

More generally, any [[verbal subgroup]] is always fully characteristic. For any [[reduced free group]], and, in particular, for any [[free group]], the converse also holds: every fully characteristic subgroup is verbal.\n\n== Transitivity ==\nThe property of being characteristic or fully characteristic is [[transitive relation|transitive]]; if {{math|''H''}} is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of {{math|''K''}}, and {{math|''K''}} is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of {{math|''G''}}, then {{math|''H''}} is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of {{math|''G''}}.\n:{{math|''H'' char ''K'' char ''G'' \u21d2 ''H'' char ''G''}}.\n\nMoreover, while normality is not transitive, it is true that every characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal.\n:{{math|''H'' char ''K'' \u22b2 ''G'' \u21d2 ''H'' \u22b2 ''G''}}\n\nSimilarly, while being strictly characteristic (distinguished) is not transitive, it is true that every fully characteristic subgroup of a strictly characteristic subgroup is strictly characteristic.\n\nHowever, unlike normality, if {{math|''H'' char ''G''}} and {{math|''K''}} is a subgroup of {{math|''G''}} containing {{math|''H''}}, then in general {{math|''H''}} is not necessarily characteristic in {{math|''K''}}.\n:{{math|''H'' char ''G'', ''H'' < ''K'' < ''G'' \u21cf ''H'' char ''K''}}\n\n== Containments ==\nEvery subgroup that is fully characteristic is certainly strictly characteristic and characteristic; but a characteristic or even strictly characteristic subgroup need not be fully characteristic.\n\nThe [[center of a group]] is always a strictly characteristic subgroup, but it is not always fully characteristic.  For example, the finite group of order 12, {{math|Sym(3) \u00d7 \u2124/2\u2124}}, has a homomorphism taking {{math|(''\u03c0'', ''y'')}} to {{math|((1, 2){{sup|''y''}}, 0)}} which takes the center, {{math|1 \u00d7 \u2124/2\u2124}}, into a subgroup of {{math|Sym(3) \u00d7 1}}, which meets the center only in the identity.\n\nThe relationship amongst these subgroup properties can be expressed as:\n:[[Subgroup]] \u21d0 [[Normal subgroup]] \u21d0 '''Characteristic subgroup''' \u21d0 Strictly characteristic subgroup \u21d0 [[Fully characteristic subgroup]] \u21d0 [[Verbal subgroup]]\n\n==Examples==\n\n=== Finite example ===\nConsider the group {{math|''G'' {{=}} S{{sub|3}} \u00d7 \u2124{{sub|2}}}} (the group of order 12 which is the direct product of the [[symmetric group]] of order 6 and a [[cyclic group]] of order 2). The center of {{math|''G''}} is its second factor {{math|\u2124{{sub|2}}}}. Note that the first factor, {{math|S{{sub|3}}}}, contains subgroups isomorphic to {{math|\u2124{{sub|2}}}}, for instance {{math|{e, (12)} }}; let {{math|''f'': \u2124{{sub|2}} \u2192 S{{sub|3}}}} be the morphism mapping {{math|\u2124{{sub|2}}}} onto the indicated subgroup. Then the composition of the projection of {{math|''G''}} onto its second factor {{math|\u2124{{sub|2}}}}, followed by {{math|''f''}}, followed by the inclusion of {{math|S{{sub|3}}}} into {{math|''G''}} as its first factor, provides an endomorphism of {{math|''G''}} under which the image of the center, {{math|\u2124{{sub|2}}}}, is not contained in the center, so here the center is not a fully characteristic subgroup of {{math|''G''}}.\n\n=== Cyclic groups ===\nEvery subgroup of a cyclic group is characteristic.\n\n=== Subgroup functors ===\nThe [[derived subgroup]] (or commutator subgroup) of a group is a verbal subgroup.  The [[torsion subgroup]] of an [[abelian group]] is a fully invariant subgroup.\n\n=== Topological groups ===\nThe [[identity component]] of a [[topological group]] is always a characteristic subgroup.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Characteristically simple group]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Subgroup properties]]", "sha1": "2ktlgvjubzvaa882qgj789uxbmux6br"}}, {"title": "List of cat breeds", "ns": "0", "id": "7199", "revision": {"id": "866278543", "parentid": "866210856", "timestamp": "2018-10-29T11:40:14Z", "contributor": {"username": "Rodw", "id": "125972"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Disambiguating links to [[Abyssinian]] (link changed to [[Abyssinian cat]]) using [[User:Qwertyytrewqqwerty/DisamAssist|DisamAssist]].", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{more footnotes|date=March 2013}}\nThe following '''list of cat breeds''' includes only domestic cat [[breed]]s and [[Felid hybrid#Domestic cat and hybridization|domestic&nbsp;\u00d7 wild hybrids]].

And \"Colo[u]rpoint Longhair\" refers to multiple different breeds in some other registries. There are several examples of nomenclatural confusion of this sort.

legal term|names of various art works|Class Action (disambiguation)}}\n{{Civil procedure (United States)}}\nA '''class action''', '''class suit''', or '''representative action''' is a type of [[lawsuit]] where one of the parties is a group of people who are represented collectively by a member of that group. The class action originated in the United States and is still predominantly a U.S. phenomenon, but Canada, as well as several European countries with [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] have made changes in recent years to allow consumer organizations to bring claims on behalf of consumers.\n\n==Description==\nIn a typical class action, a [[Plaintiff|plaintiff]] sues a defendant or a number of defendants on behalf of a group, or class, of absent parties.<ref name=Wex>{{cite web|title=Class Action|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/class_action|website=Wex Legal Dictionary|accessdate=5 May 2015}}</ref> This differs from a traditional lawsuit, where one party sues another party for redress of a wrong, and all of the parties are present in court. Although standards differ between states and countries, class actions are most common where the allegations involve a large number of people (usually 40 or more) who have been injured by the same defendant in the same way.<ref name=Wex /> Instead of each damaged person bringing his or her own lawsuit, the class action allows all the claims of all class members\u2014whether they know they have been damaged or not\u2014to be resolved in a single proceeding through the efforts of the representative plaintiff(s) and appointed class counsel.<ref name=Wex />\n\n==History==\n\n===England===\nThe antecedent of the class action was what modern observers call \"group litigation\", which appears to have been quite common in medieval [[England]] from about 1200 onward.<ref name=Yeazell>{{cite book|last1=Yeazell|first1=Stephen C.|title=From Medieval Group Litigation to the Modern Class Action|date=1987|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven}}</ref>{{rp|38}} These lawsuits involved groups of people either suing or being sued in actions at common law. These groups were usually based on existing societal structures like villages, towns, parishes, and guilds.

Entire treatises have been written since to summarize the huge mass of law that sprang up from the 1966 revision of Rule 23.<ref name=Yeazell/>{{rp|229}} Just as medieval group litigation bound all members of the group regardless of whether they all actually appeared in court, the modern class action binds ''all'' members of the class, except for those who choose to opt out (if the rules permit them to do so).\n\nThe Advisory Committee that drafted the new Rule 23 in the mid-1960s was influenced by two major developments. First was the suggestion of Harry Kalven, Jr. and Maurice Rosenfield in 1941 that class action litigation by individual shareholders on behalf of all shareholders of a company could effectively supplement direct government regulation of securities markets and other similar markets.<ref name=Yeazell/>{{rp|232}} The second development was the rise of the [[civil rights movement]], [[environmentalism]] and [[consumerism]].<ref name=Yeazell/>{{rp|240\u2013244}} The groups behind these movements, as well as many others in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, all turned to class actions as a means for achieving their goals.

''Jenkins v. Raymark Indus. Inc.'', 782 F.2d 468, 473 (5th Cir. 1986) (granting certification of a class action involving [[asbestos]]).\n\nSecond, a class action may overcome \"the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights\". ''Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor'', 521 U.S. 591, 617 (1997) (quoting ''Mace v. Van Ru Credit Corp.'', 109 F.3d 388, 344 (7th Cir. 1997)). \"A class action solves this problem by aggregating the relatively paltry potential recoveries into something worth someone's (usually an attorney's) labor.\" ''Amchem Prods., Inc.'', 521 U.S. at 617 (quoting ''Mace'', 109 F.3d at 344). In other words, a class action ensures that a [[defendant]] who engages in widespread harm{{spaced ndash}}but does so minimally against each individual [[plaintiff]]{{spaced ndash}}must compensate those individuals for their injuries. For example, thousands of shareholders of a public company may have losses too small to justify separate lawsuits, but a class action can be brought efficiently on behalf of all shareholders. Perhaps even more important than compensation is that class treatment of claims may be the only way to impose the costs of wrongdoing on the wrongdoer, thus deterring future wrongdoing.\n\nThird, class action cases may be brought to purposely change behavior of a class of which the defendant is a member. ''[[Landeros v. Flood]]'' (1976) was a landmark case decided by the [[California Supreme Court]] that aimed at purposefully changing the behavior of doctors, encouraging them to report suspected child abuse. Otherwise, they would face the threat of civil action for damages in [[tort]] proximately flowing from the failure to report the suspected injuries. Previously, many physicians had remained reluctant to report cases of apparent child abuse, despite existing law that required it.\n\nFourth, in \"limited fund\" cases, a class action ensures that all [[plaintiff]]s receive relief and that early-filing plaintiffs do not raid the fund (i.e., the [[defendant]]) of all its [[asset]]s before other [[plaintiffs]] may be compensated. See ''Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp.'', 527 U.S. 815 (1999). A class action in such a situation centralizes all claims into one [[Venue (law)|venue]] where a court can equitably divide the assets amongst all the [[plaintiffs]] if they win the case.\n\nFinally, a class action avoids the situation where different court rulings could create \"incompatible standards\" of conduct for the defendant to follow. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(1)(A). For example, a court might certify a case for class treatment where a number of individual bond-holders sue to determine whether they may convert their [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] to [[common stock]]. Refusing to litigate the case in one [[trial (law)|trial]] could result in different outcomes and inconsistent standards of conduct for the defendant [[corporation]]. Thus, courts will generally allow a class action in such a situation. See, e.g., ''Van Gemert v. Boeing Co.'', 259 F. Supp. 125 (S.D.N.Y. 1966).\n\nWhether a class action is superior to individual [[litigation]] depends on the case and is determined by the judge's ruling on a motion for class certification. The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 23, for example, states that [[mass tort]]s are ordinarily \"not appropriate\" for class treatment. Class treatment may not improve the efficiency of a mass tort because the claims frequently involve individualized issues of law and fact that will have to be re-tried on an individual basis. See ''Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co.'', 84 F.3d 734 (5th Cir. 1996) (rejecting nationwide class action against tobacco companies). Mass torts also involve high individual damage awards; thus, the absence of class treatment will not impede the ability of individual claimants to seek justice. See id. Other cases, however, may be more conducive to class treatment.\n\nThe preamble to the [[Class Action Fairness Act of 2005]], passed by the United States Congress, found:\n<blockquote>Class-action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system when they permit the fair and efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm. </blockquote>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThere are several criticisms of class actions.<ref>[[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]], [http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/cjr_4.htm \"Class Actions: The Need for a Hard Second Look\"]</ref><ref>[[Michael Greve]], [http://www.aei.org/book/814 \"Harm-Less Lawsuits? What's Wrong with Consumer Class Actions\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715221116/http://www.aei.org/book/814 |date=2009-07-15 }}</ref><ref>[[Jim Copland]], [http://www.pointoflaw.com/classactions/overview.php \"Class Actions\"]</ref> The preamble to the Class Action Fairness Act stated that some abusive class actions harmed class members with legitimate claims and defendants that have acted responsibly, adversely affected interstate commerce, and undermined public respect for the country's judicial system.\n\nClass members often receive little or no benefit from class actions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Do Class Actions Benefit Class Members?|url = http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/research/do-class-actions-benefit-class-members|website = www.instituteforlegalreform.com|access-date = 2016-01-17}}</ref> Examples cited for this include large fees for the attorneys, while leaving class members with coupons or other awards of little or no value; unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at the expense of other class members; and confusing notices are published that prevent class members from being able to fully understand and effectively exercise their rights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor example, in the United States, class lawsuits sometimes bind all class members with a low [[settlement (law)|settlement]]. These \"[[coupon settlement]]s\" (which usually allow the plaintiffs to receive a small benefit such as a small check or a coupon for future services or products with the defendant company) are a way for a defendant to forestall major liability by precluding a large number of people from litigating their claims separately, to recover reasonable compensation for the damages. However, existing law requires judicial approval of all class action settlements, and in most cases class members are given a chance to opt out of class settlement, though class members, despite opt-out notices, may be unaware of their right to opt out because they did not receive the notice, did not read it, or did not understand it.\n\nThe Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 addresses these concerns. Coupon settlements may be scrutinized by an independent expert before judicial approval in order to ensure that the settlement will be of value to the class members (28 U.S.C.A. 1712(d)). Further, if the action provides for settlement in coupons, \"the portion of any attorney\u2019s fee award to class counsel that is attributable to the award of the coupons shall be based on the value to class members of the coupons that are redeemed\". 28 U.S.C.A. 1712(a).\n\n==Ethics==\nClass action cases present significant ethical challenges. Defendants can hold reverse auctions and any of several parties can engage in collusive settlement discussions. Subclasses may have interests that diverge greatly from the class, but may be treated the same. Proposed settlements could offer some groups (such as former customers) much greater benefits than others. In one paper presented at an ABA conference on class actions in 2007, authors commented that \"competing cases can also provide opportunities for collusive settlement discussions and reverse auctions by defendants anxious to resolve their new exposure at the most economic cost\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamesholmeslaw.com/Seminar%20paper.pdf |title=Ethical Issues In Class Action Settlements |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03}}</ref>\n\n==Defendant class action==\nAlthough normally plaintiffs are the class, defendant class actions are also possible. For example, in 2005, the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon]] was sued as part of the [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Portland|Catholic priest sex-abuse scandal]]. All parishioners of the Archdiocese's churches were cited as a defendant class. This was done to include their assets (local churches) in any settlement.<ref>[http://www.archdpdx.org/bankruptcy/news/class-action-notice.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106181817/http://www.archdpdx.org/bankruptcy/news/class-action-notice.html|date=January 6, 2009}}</ref> Where both the plaintiffs and the defendants have been organized into court-approved classes, the action is called a bilateral class action.\n\n==Mass actions==\nIn a class action, the plaintiff seeks court approval to litigate on behalf of a group of similarly situated persons. Not every plaintiff looks for, or could obtain, such approval. As a procedural alternative, plaintiff's counsel may attempt to sign up every similarly situated person that counsel can find as a client. Plaintiff's counsel can then join the claims of all of these persons in one complaint, a so-called \"mass action\", hoping to have the same efficiencies and economic leverage as if a class had been certified.\n\nBecause mass actions operate outside the detailed procedures laid out for class actions, they can pose special difficulties for both plaintiffs, defendants, and the court. For example, settlement of class actions follows a predictable path of negotiation with class counsel and representatives, court scrutiny, and notice. There may not be a way to uniformly settle all of the many claims brought via a mass action. Some states permit plaintiff's counsel to settle for all the mass action plaintiffs according to a majority vote, for example. Other states, such as New Jersey, require each plaintiff to approve the settlement of that plaintiff's own individual claims.\n\n==Class action legislation==\n\n===Argentina===\nClass actions were recognized in \"Halabi\" leading case ([[Supreme Court of Argentina|Supreme Court]], 2009).\n\n===Australia and New Zealand ===\nClass actions became part of the Australian legal landscape only when the Federal Parliament amended the Federal Court of Australia Act (\"the FCAA\") in 1992 to introduce the \"representative proceedings\", the equivalent of the American \"class actions\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Class Actions in Australia - An Overnew  |url=https://www.claytonutz.com/docs/Class%20Actions_Aug04.pdf  |accessdate=2 October 2015 |publisher=Clayton Utz |author=Stuart Clark and Colin Loveday |date=2004}}</ref> Likewise, class actions appeared slowly in New Zealand legal system. However, a group can bring litigation through the action of a representative under the High Court Rules which provide that one or a multitude of persons may sue on behalf of, or for the benefit of, all persons \"with the same interest in the subject matter of a proceeding\". The presence and expansion of litigation funders have been playing a significant role in the emergence of class actions in New Zealand. For example, the \"Fair Play on Fees\" proceedings in relation to penalty fees charged by banks was funded by [[Litigation Lending Services]] (LLS), a company specializing in the funding and management of litigation in Australia and New Zealand. It was the biggest class action suit in New Zealand history.<ref name=\"slater\">{{cite web |title=Slater and Gordon announces launch of New Zealand class action against ANZ |url=https://www.slatergordon.com.au/media-centre/media-releases/slater-and-gordon-announces-launch-new-zealand-class-action-against-anz  |accessdate=2 October 2015 |publisher=Slater and Gordon  |author= |date=18 June 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"stuff\">{{cite news |title=Thousands sign up for bank class action |first=Richard  |last= Meadows |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/8408827/NZ-banks-to-face-fee-class-action |publisher=Fairfax Digital |newspaper=[[Stuff.co.nz]] |accessdate=12 March 2013 |date=11 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\nThe Austrian Code of Civil Procedure (''Zivilprozessordnung''&nbsp;\u2013 ZPO) does not provide for a special proceeding for complex class action litigation. However, Austrian consumer organizations (''Verein f\u00fcr Konsumenteninformation'' (VKI) and the Federal Chamber of Labour / ''Bundesarbeitskammer'') have, in recent years, brought claims on behalf of hundreds or even thousands of consumers. In these cases the individual consumers assigned their claims to one entity, who has then brought an ordinary (two party) lawsuit over the assigned claims. The monetary benefits were redistributed among the class. This technique, soon labelled as \"class action Austrian style\", allows for a significant reduction of overall costs. The Austrian Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, has confirmed the legal admissibility of these lawsuits under the condition that all claims are essentially based on the same grounds.\n\nThe Austrian Parliament has unanimously requested the Austrian Federal Minister for Justice to examine the possibility of new legislation providing for a cost-effective and appropriate way to deal with mass claims. Together with the Austrian Ministry for Social Security, Generations and Consumer Protection, the Justice Ministry opened the discussion with a conference held in Vienna in June, 2005. With the aid of a group of experts from many fields, the Justice Ministry began drafting the new law in September, 2005. With the individual positions varying greatly, a political consensus could not be reached.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eu2006.bmsg.gv.at/cms/eu2006/attachments/4/2/7/CH0604/CMS1133429025309/klauser.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060811044842/http://eu2006.bmsg.gv.at/cms/eu2006/attachments/4/2/7/CH0604/CMS1133429025309/klauser.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-11 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nProvincial laws in Canada allow class actions. All provinces permit plaintiff classes and some permit defendant classes. [[Quebec]] was the first province to enact class proceedings legislation in 1978. [[Ontario]] was next with the Class Proceedings Act, 1992. As of 2008, 9 of 10 provinces have enacted comprehensive class actions legislation. In [[Prince Edward Island]], where no comprehensive legislation exists, following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in ''Western Canadian Shopping Centres Inc. v. Dutton'', [2001] 2 S.C.R. 534, class actions may be advanced under a local rule of court. The Federal Court of Canada permits class actions under Part V.1. of the Federal Courts Rules.\n\nLegislation in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Manitoba]], [[Ontario]], and [[Nova Scotia]] expressly or by judicial opinion has been read to allow for what are informally known as national \"opt-out\" class actions, whereby residents of other provinces may be included in the class definition and potentially be bound by the court's judgment on common issues unless they opt out in a prescribed manner and time. Court rulings have determined that this permits a court in one province to include residents of other provinces in the class action on an \"opt-out\" basis.\n\nRecent judicial opinions have indicated that provincial legislative national opt-out powers should not be exercised to interfere with the ability of another province to certify a parallel class action for residents of other provinces. The first court to certify will generally exclude residents of provinces whose courts have certified a parallel class action. However, in the [[Vioxx]] litigation, two provincial courts recently certified overlapping class actions whereby Canadian residents are class members in two class actions in two provinces.<ref>Ontario: ''Tiboni v.

This means that the class action is designed to declare the defendant generally liable with ''erga omnes'' effects if and only if the defendant is found liable, and the declaratory judgment can be used then to pursue damages in the same procedure or in individual ones in different jurisdictions. If the latter is the case, the liability cannot be discussed but only the damages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://globalclassactions.stanford.edu/content/class-actions-chile-update|title=Class Actions in Chile: Update {{!}} Global Class Actions Exchange|website=globalclassactions.stanford.edu|access-date=2016-10-25}}</ref> There under the Chilean procedural rules, one particular case works as an opt-out class action for damages.

It is not like class actions in the United States{{spaced ndash}}it only applies to parties who have already filed suit and does not allow a claim to be brought in the name of an unknown group of claimants.

Consumer associations can file claims on behalf of groups of consumers to obtain judicial orders against corporations that cause injury or damage to consumers. These types of claims are increasing and Italian courts have recently allowed them against banks that continue to apply compound interest on retail clients' current account overdrafts. The introduction of class actions is on the new government's agenda. On November 19, 2007, the Senato della Repubblica passed a class action law in Finanziaria 2008, a financial document for the economy management of the government. Now (from 10 December 2007), in order of Italian legislation system, the law is before the House and has to be passed also by the Camera dei Deputati, the second house of Italian Parliament, to become an effective law.<ref>More information [http://www.classactionitalia.com Class Action Italia]</ref> In 2004, the Italian parliament considered the introduction of a type of class action, specifically in the area of consumer law. To date, no such law has been enacted, but scholars demonstrated that class actions (''azioni rappresentative'') do not contrast with Italian principles of civil procedure. Class action is regulated by art. 140 bis of the Italian consumers' code and will be in force from 1 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tedioli.com/Italian_class_action_text_english_version.pdf |title=art. 140 bis |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref><ref>FAVA P., L'importabilit\u00e0 delle class actions in Italia, in Contratto e Impresa 1/2004 FAVA P., Class actions all'italiana: \"Paese che vai, usanza che trovi\" (l\u2019esperienza dei principali ordinamenti giuridici stranieri e le proposte A.A.C.C. n. 3838 e n. 3839), in Corr.

Although not strictly \"class action litigation\" as it is understood in American law, [[Public Interest Litigation]] arose out of the wide powers of judicial review granted to the Supreme Court of India and the various High Courts under [[s:Constitution of India/Part III#Article 32 .7BRemedies for enforcement of rights conferred by this Part.7D|Article 32]] and Article 226 of the [[Constitution of India]], respectively. The sort of remedies sought from courts in Public Interest Litigation go beyond mere award of damages to all affected groups and have sometimes (controversially) gone on to include Court monitoring of the implementation of legislation and even the framing of guidelines in the absence of [[Parliament of India|Parliamentary legislation]].<ref name=\"pil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.legalserviceindia.com/articles/pil.htm |title=PIL A Boon Or A Bane |publisher=Legalserviceindia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref><ref name=\"let\">{{cite web|url=http://www.karmayog.org/pil/pil_10720.htm |title=Introduction to Public Interest Litigation |publisher=Karmayog.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-04}}</ref>\n\nHowever, this innovative jurisprudence did not help the victims of the [[Bhopal disaster|Bhopal gas tragedy]],{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} who were unable to fully prosecute a class action litigation (as understood in the American sense) against [[Union Carbide]] due to procedural rules that would make such litigation impossible to conclude and unwieldy to carry out. Instead, the [[Government of India]] exercised its right of ''[[parens patriae]]'' to appropriate all the claims of the victims and proceeded to litigate on their behalf, first in the New York courts and later, in the Indian courts. Ultimately, the matter was settled between the Union of India and Union Carbide (in a settlement overseen by the Supreme Court of India) for a sum of {{INRConvert|760|c}} as a complete settlement of all claims of all victims for all time to come.\n\nPublic interest litigation has now broadened in scope to cover larger and larger groups of citizens who may be affected by Government inaction. Recent examples of this trend include the conversion of all public transport in the city of Delhi from diesel engines to CNG engines on the basis of the orders of the Delhi High Court; the monitoring of forest use by the High Courts and the Supreme Court to ensure that there is no unjustified loss of forest cover; and the directions mandating the disclosure of assets of electoral candidates for the Houses of Parliament and State Assembly.<ref name=\"Union of India Vs.

Observers point out that many High Courts and certain Supreme Court judges are reluctant to entertain PILs filed by [[non-governmental organization]]s and activists, citing concerns of [[separation of powers]] and [[parliamentary sovereignty]].\n\n===Netherlands===\nDutch law allows associations (''verenigingen'') and foundations (''stichtingen'') to bring a so-called collective action on behalf of other persons, provided they can represent the interests of such persons according to their by-laws (''statuten'') (section 3:305a Dutch Civil Code). All types of actions are permitted, excluding a claim for monetary damages. Most class actions over the past decade have been in the field of securities fraud and financial services. The acting association or foundation may come to a collective settlement with the defendant. The settlement may also include&nbsp;\u2013 and usually primarily consists of&nbsp;\u2013 monetary compensation of damages. Such settlement can be declared binding for all injured parties by the Amsterdam Court of Appeal (section 7:907 Dutch Civil Code). The injured parties have an opt-out right during the opt-out period set by the Court, usually 3 to 6 months. Settlements involving injured parties from outside The Netherlands can also be declared binding by the Court. Since US courts are reluctant to take up class actions brought on behalf of injured parties not residing in the US who have suffered damages due to acts or omissions committed outside the US, combinations of US class actions and Dutch collective actions may come to a settlement that covers plaintiffs worldwide. An example of this is the Royal Dutch Shell Oil Reserves Settlement that was declared binding upon both US and non-US plaintiffs.\n\n===Poland===\n\"Pozew zbiorowy\" or class action is allowed under the Polish law since July 19, 2010. A minimum of 10 persons, suing based on the same law, is required.\n\n===Spain===\nSpanish law allows nominated consumer associations to take action to protect the interests of consumers. A number of groups already have the power to bring collective or class actions: certain consumer associations, bodies legally constituted to defend the \"collective interest\" and groups of injured parties.\n\nRecent changes to Spanish civil procedure rules include the introduction of a quasi-class action right for certain consumer associations to claim damages on behalf of unidentified classes of consumers. The rules require consumer associations to represent an adequate number of affected parties who have suffered the same harm. Also any judgment made by the Spanish court will list the individual beneficiaries or, if that is not possible, conditions that need to be fulfilled for a party to benefit from a judgment.\n\n===Switzerland===\nSwiss law does not allow for any form of class action. When the [[Swiss Federal Council|government]] proposed a new federal code of civil procedure in 2006, replacing the cantonal codes of civil procedure, it rejected the introduction of class actions, arguing that\n{{quote|[It] is alien to European legal thought to allow somebody to exercise rights on the behalf of a large number of people if these do not participate as parties in the action. ... Moreover, the ''class action'' is controversial even in its country of origin, the U.S., because it can result in significant procedural problems. ... Finally, the ''class action'' can be openly or discretely abused. The sums sued for are usually enormous, so that the respondent can be forced to concede, if they do not want to face sudden [[debt|huge indebtness]] and [[insolvency]] (so-called ''legal [[blackmail]]'').<ref>Message to Parliament on the Swiss Code of Civil Procedure, [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/ff/2006/index0_37.html Federal Journal 2006 p. 7221] et seq.

The case, ''[[Frank v. Gaos]]'', which challenges that the award was not \"fair, reasonable, and adequate\", will be heard by the Supreme Court during its October 2018-June 2019 session.\n\nClass members in Rule 23 certified classes are, generally, subject to an opt-out mechanism, meaning that they (once the class definition is certified) are participants in the matter unless they opt-out (i.e., affirmatively exclude themselves therefrom). This procedure is followed, and class members are bound, regardless of whether they received actual notice, so long as the notice issued met the requisite due process requirements. Conversely, some types of class actions or so-called \"collective actions\" (e.g., actions to enforce the federal Fair Labor Standards Act or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967) are opt-in actions brought pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7216(b) (see, also 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 626(b)). In such \"216b\" actions, class members are not bound by the results of the collective action, and their claims are not tolled during the pendency thereof, until they opt-in by filing a Consent to join the litigation. Due to the tenuous rights of class members in collective actions prior to opt-in, certification in such actions is subject to a much lower standard.<ref>Cole, Scott Edward, {{cite web|url=https://scalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publication19.pdf |title=To certify or not to certify |publisher=The Boston University Public Interest Law Journal, 2004}}</ref><ref>Cole, Scott Edward, {{cite web|url=https://scalaw.com/wp-content/uploads/publication20.pdf |title=The Quest for Class Certification |publisher=Employment Law Strategist, September & October 2003}}</ref>\n\n=====Notice and settlement=====\n{{Expand section|This needs much more detail on notice and on settlement procedures|date=May 2015}}\n\n[[Due process]] requires in most cases that notice describing the class action be sent, published, or broadcast to class members. As part of this notice procedure, there may have to be several notices, first a notice giving class members the opportunity to opt out of the class, i.e. if individuals wish to proceed with their own litigation they are entitled to do so, only to the extent that they give timely notice to the class counsel or the court that they are opting out. Second, if there is a settlement proposal, the court will usually direct the class counsel to send a settlement notice to all the members of the certified class, informing them of the details of the proposed settlement.\n\n====State courts====\nSince 1938, many states have adopted rules similar to the FRCP. However, some states, like [[California]], have civil procedure systems, which deviate significantly from the federal rules; the [[California Codes]] provide for four separate types of class actions.

That is the [[judge]]'s strongest power to impose [[sanctions (law)|sanctions]] for acts that disrupt the court's normal process.\n\nA finding of being in contempt of court may result from a failure to obey a lawful order of a court, showing disrespect for the judge, disruption of the proceedings through poor behavior, or publication of material or non-disclosure of material, which in doing so is deemed likely to jeopardize a [[fair trial]]. A judge may impose sanctions such as a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] or [[jail]] for someone found guilty of contempt of court. Judges in [[common law]] systems usually have more extensive power to declare someone in contempt than judges in [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems. The client or person must be proven guilty before being punished.\n\n==In use today==\nContempt of court is essentially seen as a form of disturbance that may impede the functioning of the court. The judge may impose fines and/or jail time upon any person committing contempt of court.

Contempt of court is the only remaining [[common law offence]] in Canada, besides the related offence of [[Contempt of Parliament]].<ref>[http://www.courts.gov.bc.ca/legal_compendium/Chapter22.asp A Compendium of Law and Judges]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nContempt of court includes the following behaviors:\n* Failing to maintain a respectful attitude, failing to remain silent or failing to refrain from showing approval or disapproval of the proceeding\n* Refusing or neglecting to obey a subpoena\n* Willfully disobeying a process or order of the court\n* Interfering with the orderly administration of justice or impairing the authority or dignity of the court\n* An officer of the court failing to perform his or her duties\n* A sheriff or bailiff not executing a writ of the court forthwith or not making a return thereof\n\n====Canadian Federal courts====\n''This section applies only to [[Federal Court of Appeal]] and [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]].''\n\nUnder Federal Court Rules, Rules 466, and Rule 467 a person who is accused of Contempt needs to be first served with a contempt order and then appear in court to answer the charges. Convictions can only be made when proof beyond a reasonable doubt is achieved.<ref>[https://archive.is/20030503180331/http://reports.fja.gc.ca/regles/partie12.html Federal Court Rules Chapter 12]</ref>\n\nIf it is a matter of urgency or the contempt was done in front of a judge, that person can be punished immediately. Punishment can range from the person being imprisoned for a period of less than five years or until the person complies with the order or fine.\n\n====Tax Court of Canada====\nUnder [[Tax Court of Canada]] Rules of ''Tax Court of Canada Act'', a person who is found to be in contempt may be imprisoned for a period of less than two years or fined. Similar procedures for serving an order first is also used at the Tax Court.\n\n====Provincial courts====\nDifferent procedures exist for different provincial courts. For example, in [[British Columbia]], a [[justice of the peace]] can only issue a summons to an offender for contempt, which will be dealt with by a judge, even if the offence was done in the face of the justice.<ref>[http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/P/96379_01.htm#section31 Provincial Court Act Jurisdiction of justice]</ref>\n\n===Hong Kong===\nJudges from the [[Court of Final Appeal (Hong Kong)|Court of Final Appeal]], [[High Court (Hong Kong)|High Court]], [[District Court (Hong Kong)|District Court]] along with members from the various tribunals and Coroner's Court all have the power to impose immediate punishments for contempt in the face of the court, derived from legislation or through [[common law]]:\n\n* Insult a judge or justice, witness or [[officers of the court]]\n* Interrupts the proceedings of the court\n* Interfere with the course of justice\n* Misbehaves in court (e.g., use of [[mobile phone]] or recording devices without permission)\n* [[Juror]] who leaves without permission of the court during proceedings\n* Disobeying a judgment or court order\n* Breach of undertaking\n* Breach of a duty imposed upon a solicitor by rules of court\n\nThe use of insulting or threatening language in the [[magistrates' court (Hong Kong)|magistrates' courts]] or against a magistrate is in breach of section 99 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap 227) which states the magistrate can 'summarily sentence the offender to a fine at level 3 and to imprisonment for 6 months.'\n\nIn addition, certain appeal boards are given the statutory authority for contempt by them (e.g., Residential Care Home, Hotel and Guesthouse Accommodation, Air Pollution Control, etc.). For contempt in front of these boards, the chairperson will certify the act of contempt to the [[Court of First Instance (Hong Kong)|Court of First Instance]] who will then proceed with a hearing and determine the punishment.\n\n===India===\nIn India contempt of court is of two types:\n\n{{ordered list\n| Civil contempt: Under Section 2(b) of the Contempt of Courts Act of 1971, civil contempt has been defined as wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a court or wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court.\n| Criminal contempt: Under Section 2(c) of the Contempt of Courts Act of 1971, criminal contempt has been defined as the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which:{{ordered list| list_style_type= lower-roman\n| Scandalises or tends to scandalise, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of, any court, or\n| Prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with the due course of any judicial proceeding, or\n| Interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.}}}}\n====Punishment====\nSix months, or fine up to \u20b92000, or both.{{clarify|reason=Is the punishment the same for both types of contempt?|date=April 2018}}\n\n===England and Wales===\nIn [[England|English]] law (a [[common law]] jurisdiction) the law on contempt is partly set out in case law, and partly specified in the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]]. Contempt may be a [[Crime|criminal]] or [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] offence. The maximum sentence for criminal contempt is two years.\n\nDisorderly, contemptuous, or insolent behavior toward the judge or magistrates while holding the court, tending to interrupt the due course of a trial or other judicial proceeding, may be prosecuted as \"direct\" contempt. The term \"direct\" means that the court itself cites the person in contempt by describing the behavior observed on the record. Direct contempt is distinctly different from indirect contempt, wherein another individual may file papers alleging contempt against a person who has willfully violated a lawful court order.\n\n====Criminal contempt of court====\nThe [[Crown Court]] is a [[Superior court|superior court of record]] under the [[Senior Courts Act 1981]] and accordingly has power to punish for contempt of its own motion. The [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] has stated that this power applies in three circumstances:\n\n# Contempt \"in the face of the court\" (not to be taken literally; the judge does not need to see it, provided it took place within the court precincts or relates to a case currently before that court);\n# Disobedience of a court order; and\n# Breaches of undertakings to the court.\n\nWhere it is necessary to act quickly the judge (even the trial judge) may act to sentence for contempt.\n\nWhere it is not necessary to be so urgent, or where indirect contempt has taken place the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] can intervene and the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] will institute criminal proceedings on his behalf before a Divisional Court of the [[Queen's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]].\n\n[[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' court]]s are not superior courts of record, but nonetheless have powers granted under the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]]. They may detain any person who insults the court or otherwise disrupts its proceedings until the end of the sitting. Upon the contempt being either admitted or proved the judge or [[Justice of the peace|JP]] may imprison the offender for a maximum of one month, fine them up to \u00a32,500, or do both.\n\nIt is contempt of court to bring an audio recording device or picture-taking device of any sort into an English court without the consent of the court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/contempt_of_court/|title=Contempt of Court and Reporting Restrictions: Legal Guidance: The Crown Prosecution Service|website=www.cps.gov.uk|access-date=2017-03-29}}</ref>\n\nIt is not contempt of court (under section 10 of the Act) for a journalist to refuse to disclose his sources, unless the court has considered the evidence available and determined that the information is \"necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime\".\n\n====Strict liability contempt====\nUnder the Contempt of Court Act 1981 it is criminal contempt of court to publish anything which creates a real risk that the course of justice in proceedings may be seriously impaired. It only applies where proceedings are active, and the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] has issued guidance as to when he believes this to be the case, and there is also statutory guidance. The clause prevents the newspapers and media from publishing material that is too extreme or sensationalist about a criminal case until the trial or linked trials are over and the juries have given their verdicts.\n\nSection 2 of the Act limits the [[common law]] presumption that conduct may be treated as contempt regardless of intention: now only cases where there is a substantial risk of serious prejudice to a trial are affected.\n\n====Civil contempt====\nIn civil proceedings there are two main ways in which contempt is committed:\n\n# Failure to attend at court despite a [[summons#Civil summons|summons]] requiring attendance. In respect of the High Court, historically a [[Latitat|writ of latitat]] would have been issued, but now a [[bench warrant]] is issued, authorizing the [[tipstaff]] to arrange for the arrest of the individual, and imprisonment until the date and time the court appoints to next sit. In practice a groveling letter of apology to the court is sufficient to ward off this possibility, and in any event the warrant is generally \"backed for bail\"\u2014i.e., [[bail]] will be granted once the arrest has been made and a location where the person can be found in future established.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n# Failure to comply with a court order. A copy of the order, with a \"penal notice\"\u2014i.e., notice informing the recipient that if they do not comply they are subject to imprisonment\u2014is served on the person concerned. If, after that, they breach the order, proceedings can be started and in theory the person involved can be sent to prison. In practice this rarely happens as the cost on the claimant of bringing these proceedings is significant and in practice imprisonment is rarely ordered as an apology or fine are usually considered appropriate.\n\n===United States===\nIn United States [[jurisprudence]], acts of contempt are generally divided into direct or indirect and civil or criminal. Direct contempt occurs in the presence of a judge; civil contempt is \"coercive and remedial\" as opposed to [[punitive]]. In the United States, relevant statutes include {{usc|18|401|403}} and [[Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure]] 42.<ref>[Doyle C. (2010).

''Congressional Research Service.</ref>\n\n# Direct contempt is that which occurs in the presence of the presiding judge (''in facie curiae'') and may be dealt with summarily: the judge notifies the offending party that he or she has acted in a manner which disrupts the tribunal and prejudices the administration of justice. After giving the person the opportunity to respond, the judge may impose the sanction immediately.\n# Indirect contempt occurs outside the immediate presence of the court and consists of disobedience of a court's prior order. Generally a party will be accused of indirect contempt by the party for whose benefit the order was entered. A person cited for indirect contempt is entitled to notice of the charge and an opportunity for hearing of the evidence of contempt and, since there is no written procedure, may or may not be allowed to present evidence in rebuttal.\n\nContempt of court in a [[civil suit]] is generally not considered to be a criminal offense, with the party benefiting from the order also holding responsibility for the enforcement of the order. However, some cases of civil contempt have been perceived as intending to harm the reputation of the plaintiff, or to a lesser degree, the judge or the court.\n\nSanctions for contempt may be criminal or civil. If a person is to be punished criminally, then the contempt must be proven beyond a [[Legal burden of proof|reasonable doubt]], but once the charge is proven, then punishment (such as a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]] or, in more serious cases, imprisonment) is imposed unconditionally. The civil sanction for contempt (which is typically incarceration in the custody of the [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]] or similar court officer) is limited in its imposition for so long as the disobedience to the court's order continues: once the party complies with the court's order, the sanction is lifted. The imposed party is said to \"hold the keys\" to his or her own cell, thus conventional [[due process of law|due process]] is not required. In federal and most state courts, the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] for civil contempt is [[clear and convincing evidence]], a lower standard than in criminal cases.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO3y5uG8-6wC&lpg=PT671&dq=civil%20contempt%20clear%20and%20convincing&pg=PT671#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Understanding Remedies|last=Fischer|first=James M.|date=2010-12-07|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=9781422486559|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn civil contempt cases there is no [[Proportionality (law)|principle of proportionality]]. In ''Chadwick v. Janecka'' (3d Cir. 2002), a U.S. court of appeals held that [[H. Beatty Chadwick]] could be held indefinitely under federal law, for his failure to produce US$2.5 million as state court ordered in a civil trial. Chadwick had been imprisoned for nine years at that time and continued to be held in prison until 2009, when a state court set him free after 14 years, making his imprisonment the longest on a contempt charge to date.\n\nCivil contempt is only appropriate when the imposed party has the power to comply with the underlying order.<ref>{{cite web|title=See In re Marciano|url=http://www.protectyou.com/blog/case-law/in-re-marciano/|publisher=Westlaw|location=Donlevy-Rosen & Rosen, P.A.}}</ref>  Controversial contempt rulings have periodically arisen from cases involving [[asset protection]] trusts, where the court has ordered a settlor of an asset protection trust to repatriate assets so that the assets may be made available to a creditor.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Importance of Proper APT Design & Counsel|url=http://protectyou.com/1998/10/the-importance-of-a-property-asset-protection-design/|publisher=The Asset Protection News|author=Howard Rosen|author2=Patricia Donlevy-Rosen}}</ref>  A court cannot maintain an order of contempt where the imposed party does not have the ability to comply with the underlying order.

At least one Supreme Court Justice has made calls for jury trials to replace judge trials on contempt cases.<ref name=\"autogenerated1964\">''United States v.

For example, W, a witness, testifies that she saw X drive his automobile into a green car.  Meanwhile, Y, another witness, testifies that when he examined X's car, later that day, he noticed green paint on its fender. There can also be corroborating evidence related to a certain source, such as what makes an author think a certain way due to the evidence that was supplied by witnesses or objects.<ref>For more information on this type of reasoning, see: [[Casuistry]].</ref>\n\nAnother type of corroborating evidence comes from using the [[Baconian method]], i.e. the  [[method of agreement]], [[Mill's Methods#Method of difference|method of difference]], and [[method of concomitant variations]].\n\nThese methods are followed in [[experimental design]]. They were codified by [[Francis Bacon (philosopher)|Francis Bacon]], and developed further by [[John Stuart Mill]] and consist of controlling several [[Dependent and independent variables|variables]], in turn, to establish which variables are [[causality|causally]] connected. These principles are widely used intuitively in various kinds of proofs, demonstrations and investigations, in addition to being fundamental to experimental design.\n\nIn law, corroboration refers to the requirement in some jurisdictions, such as in [[Scots Law|Scotland]], that any evidence adduced be backed up by at least one other source (see [[Corroboration in Scots law]]).\n\n==Corroboration broken down==\nIf one person says, \u201cthis is what I intended by the action I took,\u201d and his friend agrees that his actions could have looked like what their friend intended. Then it can be generally agreed that is what happened.\n\nIf one person says, \u201cthis is what I meant by what I said,\u201d and his friend agrees that was their understanding of what was meant by their friend. Then it can be generally agreed that is what was meant.\n\n==An example of corroboration==\nDefendant says \"It was like what he/she (a witness) said and...\". This is corroborative evidence from the defendant that the evidence the witness gave is true and correct.\n\nCorroboration is not needed in certain instances. For example, there are certain statutory exceptions. In the [[Education (Scotland) Act]], it is only necessary to produce a register as proof of lack of attendance. No further evidence is needed.\n\n==England and Wales==\n'''Perjury'''\n\nSee section 13 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].\n\n'''Speeding offences'''\n\nSee section 89(2) of the [[Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984]].\n\n'''Sexual offences'''\n\nSee section 32 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].\n\n'''Confessions by mentally handicapped persons'''\n\nSee section 77 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]].\n\n'''Evidence of children'''\n\nSee section 34 of the [[Criminal Justice Act 1988]].\n\n'''Evidence of accomplices'''\n\nSee section 32 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Karl Popper]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Plutchik, Robert (1983), ''Foundations of Experimental Research'', Harper's Experimental Psychology Series.\n\n[[Category:Evidence law]]\n[[Category:Philosophy of science]]", "sha1": "2hgznytrgw3j1nausknwopdxws7v042"}}, {"title": "Cross-examination", "ns": "0", "id": "7203", "revision": {"id": "865551787", "parentid": "859748435", "timestamp": "2018-10-24T16:36:51Z", "contributor": {"username": "Amisom", "id": "16032873"}, "comment": "too weasely and totally unsourced .Has been for 18 months.

It is preceded by [[direct examination]] (in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] known as [[examination-in-chief]]) and may be followed by a [[Redirect examination|redirect]] ([[re-examination]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Pakistan]]).\n\n== Variations by jurisdiction ==\nIn the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal Courts]], a cross-examining [[lawyer|attorney]] is typically not permitted to ask questions that do not pertain to the testimony offered during direct examination, but most [[State court (United States)|state courts]] do permit a lawyer to cross-examine a witness on matters not raised during direct examination. Similarly, courts in England, South Africa, Australia, and Canada allow a cross-examiner to exceed the scope of direct examination.\n\nSince a witness called by the opposing party is presumed to be [[hostile witness|hostile]], cross-examination does permit [[leading question]]s. A witness called by the direct examiner, on the other hand, may only be treated as hostile by that examiner after being permitted to do so by the judge, at the request of that examiner and as a result of the witness being openly antagonistic and/or prejudiced against the opposing party.<ref>Ehrhardt, Charles W. and Stephanie J.

Accessed November 26, 2008.</ref>\n\n== Affecting the outcome of jury trials ==\nCross-examination is a key component in a trial and the topic is given substantial attention during courses on [[Trial Advocacy]].<ref>Lubet, Steven; ''Modern Trial Advocacy'', NITA, New York, NY 2004 pp. 83 et. seq. {{ISBN|1556818866}}</ref> The opinions by a jury or judge are often changed during cross examination if doubt is cast on the witness. In other times a credible witness affirms the belief in their original statements or in some cases enhances the judge's or jury's belief. Though the closing argument is often considered the deciding moment of a trial, effective cross-examination wins trials.<ref>{{cite book| title=Relentless Criminal Cross-Examination| last=Mahoney| first=Kevin J| location=Costa Mesa, California| publisher=James Publishing| year=2008| isbn=158012125X}}</ref>\n\nAttorneys anticipate [[hostile witness]]' responses during pretrial planning, and often attempt to shape the witnesses' perception of the questions to draw out information helpful to the attorney's case.<ref>Dreier, A.S.; ''Strategy, Planning & Litigating to Win''; Conatus, Boston, MA, 2012, pp. 79-85; {{ISBN|0615676952}}</ref>  Typically during an attorney's [[closing argument]] he will repeat any admissions made by witnesses that favor their case. Indeed, in the United States, cross-examination is seen as a core part of the entire [[adversarial system]] of justice, in that it \"is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested.\"<ref>''Davis v. Alaska'', {{ussc|415|308|1974}}.</ref> Another key component affecting a trial outcome is the [[jury selection]], in which attorneys will attempt to include jurors from whom they feel they can get a favorable response or at the least unbiased fair decision. So while there are many factors affecting the outcome of a trial, the cross-examination of a witness will often influence an open-minded unbiased jury searching for the certainty of facts upon which to base their decision.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Litigation strategy]]\n* [[Testimony]]\n* [[Trial advocacy]]\n* [[Witness impeachment]]\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Wiktionary|cross-examination}}\n*{{cite book | title=Advocacy 2007/2008 (Blackstone Bar Manual) | author=[[City Law School]] | location=Oxford | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | year=2007 | isbn=0-19-921220-1 }}\n*{{cite book | title=The Art of the Advocate | author=Du Cann, Richard | location=London | publisher=Penguin | year=1993 | isbn=0-14-017931-3 }}\n*{{cite book | title=The Golden Rules of Advocacy | author=Evans, K. | year=1993 | location=London | publisher=[[Blackstone Press]] | isbn=1-85431-259-6 }}\n*{{cite book | title=The Devil's Advocate | author=Morley, I | location=London | publisher=[[Sweet & Maxwell]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-421-91480-7 }}\n*{{cite book | title=Advocacy | author=Ross, D. | location=London | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=2005 | isbn=0-521-61117-2 }}\n*{{cite book | title=[[The Art of Cross-Examination]] | author=Wellman, F. | year=2007 | isbn=1-59462-647-2 | origyear=1903 | publisher=[[Standard Publications]] }}\n*{{cite book | title=Relentless Criminal Cross-Examination | author=Mahoney, K. | year=2008 | publisher=[[James Publishing Company]] | isbn=978-1-58012-125-5}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cross-Examination}}\n[[Category:Criminal procedure]]\n[[Category:Civil procedure]]\n[[Category:Evidence law]]\n[[Category:Testimony]]", "sha1": "gm8gqmlw8mhsssfqic1vqkbaae6b6b0"}}, {"title": "Christiania", "ns": "0", "id": "7206", "revision": {"id": "851169395", "parentid": "843375869", "timestamp": "2018-07-20T14:43:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "Narky Blert", "id": "22041646"}, "minor": "", "comment": "NOTOC", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "__NOTOC__\n{{wiktionary|Christiania}}\n'''Christiania''' may refer to:\n\n==Businesses and organizations==\n* [[Christiania Bank]], a former Norwegian bank\n* [[Christiania Theatre]] in Oslo, Norway\n* [[Christiania Spigerverk]], a steel company which was founded in Oslo, Norway, in 1853\n* [[Christiania Norwegian Theatre]], founded in 1852 under the name of Norwegian Dramatic School\n* ''[[Christiania Avertissements-Blad]]'', a former Norwegian newspaper, issued in Oslo, 1861\u20131971\n\n==Places==\n* Christiania or Kristiania, names of [[Oslo]] (1624\u20131924), expression (from 1925) for the part of Oslo that was founded by King Christian IV\n* [[Christiania Islands]], a group of islands in the Palmer Archipelago\n* [[Christiania Township, Minnesota]], a township in Jackson County, U.S.\n* [[Freetown Christiania]] (or ''Christiania''), a self-proclaimed autonomous neighborhood in Copenhagen, Denmark\n\n==Sports==\n* [[Christiania Rebels]], an American football team located in Oslo, Norway\n* [[Christiania SK]], a Norwegian Nordic skiing club, based in Oslo, Norway\n\n==Other uses==\n* [[Christiania (brachiopod)|''Christiania'' (brachiopod)]], a genus of Strophomenid brachiopods found in the Arenig geological group\n* [[Christiania Burgher School]], a private middle school in Christiania, Norway\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cristian (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Christiana (disambiguation)]]\n* [[Christiania Township (disambiguation)]]\n\n* {{look from}}\n\n{{disambiguation|geo}}", "sha1": "lrtwk6u654b4gxn7rkepn6750j7tb9p"}}, {"title": "Charles d'Abancour", "ns": "0", "id": "7207", "revision": {"id": "783251078", "parentid": "770893188", "timestamp": "2017-06-01T01:59:09Z", "contributor": {"username": "Magic links bot", "id": "30707369"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Replace [[Help:Magic links|magic links]] with templates per [[Special:Permalink/772743896#Future of magic links|local RfC]] and [[:mw:Requests for comment/Future of magic links|MediaWiki RfC]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Expand German|Charles-Xavier Franqueville d\u2019Abancourt|date=July 2013}}\n\n'''Charles Xavier Joseph de Franque Ville d'Abancour''' (4 July 1758{{snd}}9 September 1792)<ref>{{cite web | title=G.H.C.

The P-40 design was a modification of the previous [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] which reduced development time and enabled a rapid entry into production and operational service. The Warhawk was used by most [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] during World War II, and remained in frontline service until the end of the war. It was the third most-produced American fighter of World War II, after the [[North American P-51 Mustang|P-51]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt|P-47]]; by November 1944, when production of the P-40 ceased, 13,738 had been built,<ref name=Murphy>Murphy and McNiece 2009, p. 83.</ref> all at [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation]]'s main production facilities at [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\nP-40 Warhawk was the name the [[United States Army Air Corps]] and after June 1941, [[USAAF]]-adopted name for all models, making it the official name in the U.S. for all P-40s. The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] and [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|Soviet]] air forces used the name '''Tomahawk''' for models equivalent to the P-40B and P-40C, and the name '''Kittyhawk''' for models equivalent to the P-40D and all later variants.\n\nP-40s first saw combat with the British Commonwealth squadrons of the [[Desert Air Force]] in the Middle East and North African campaigns, during June 1941.<ref name = \"nijbrw\">Alexander 2006, p. 25.</ref><ref name = \"lmnsbs\">Brown 1983, p. 20.</ref> [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|No. 112 Squadron]] [[Royal Air Force]], was among the first to operate Tomahawks in North Africa and the unit was the first [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] military aviation unit to feature the \"shark mouth\" logo,<ref name=Crawford>Crawford 1977, p. 14.</ref><ref>Vader 1970, p. 95.</ref> copying [[ZG 76|similar markings]] on some Luftwaffe [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] twin-engine fighters.<ref name=Crawford/> {{refn|Inspired by 112 Squadron's usage of them in North Africa, and by the Luftwaffe's earlier use of it, both via Allied wartime newspaper and magazine article images, [[Nose art|the \"shark mouth\" logo]] on the sides of the P-40's nose was most famously used on those of the [[Flying Tigers]] in China.

However, between 1941 and 1944, the P-40 played a critical role with Allied air forces in three major theaters: [[North African Campaign|North Africa]], the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]], and [[Second Sino-Japanese War|China]]. It also had a significant role in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre|Middle East]], [[South-East Asian Theatre of World War II|Southeast Asia]], [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Europe]], [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Alaska]] and [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]]. The P-40's performance at high altitudes was not as important in those theaters, where it served as an [[air superiority fighter]], bomber escort and [[fighter-bomber]]. Although it gained a postwar reputation as a mediocre design, suitable only for [[close air support]], more recent research including scrutiny of the records of individual Allied squadrons indicates that this was not the case: the P-40 performed surprisingly well as an air superiority fighter, at times suffering severe losses, but also inflicting a very heavy toll on enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"P40Zero\">Masell, Patrick.

In contrast to the \"three-point landing\" commonly employed with British types, P-40 pilots were obliged to use a \"wheels landing\": a longer, low angle approach that touched down on the main wheels first.\n\nTesting showed the aircraft did not have the performance needed for use in [[North-West Europe|Northwest Europe]] at high-altitude, due to the service ceiling limitation.

Retrieved: 4 August 2011.</ref>\n\nCompared to opposing Japanese fighters, the P-40B's strengths were that it was sturdy, well armed, faster in a dive and possessed an excellent rate of roll. While the P-40s could not match the maneuverability of the Japanese Army air arm's [[Nakajima Ki-27]]s and [[Nakajima Ki-43|Ki-43s]], nor the much more famous [[Mitsubishi A6M|Zero naval fighter]] in a slow speed turning dogfight, at higher speeds the P-40s were more than a match. AVG leader [[Claire Chennault]] trained his pilots to use the P-40's particular performance advantages.<ref name=tiger1/> The P-40 had a higher dive speed than any Japanese fighter aircraft of the early war years, for example, and could be used to exploit so-called \"boom-and-zoom\" tactics. The AVG was highly successful, and its feats were widely published, to boost sagging public morale at home, by an active cadre of international journalists. According to its official records, in just 6 1/2 months, the Flying Tigers destroyed 297 enemy aircraft for the loss of just four of its own in air-to-air combat.\n\nThe Model Bs received by Chennault and assembled in Burma at the end of 1941 were not well liked. There were no auxiliary fuel tanks that could be dropped before going into combat, and there were no bomb racks on the wings. Chennault considered the liquid-cooled engine vulnerable in combat because a single bullet through the coolant tank would cause the engine to overheat in minutes. The Tomahawks also had no radios, so the AVG improvised by installing a fragile radio transceiver, RCA-7-H, which had been built for a Piper Cub. Because the plane lacked a supercharger, its effective ceiling was about 25,000 feet. The most critical problem was the lack of spare parts; the only source of spare parts was damaged aircraft. The planes were thought to be what no one else wanted, dangerous and difficult to fly. But the plane had advantages: its gas tanks were self-sealing and could take hits without catching fire. There were two heavy sheets of steel behind the pilot's head and back. The plane as a whole was ruggedly constructed.<ref>Schultz, Duane. 1987. The Maverick War, Chennault and the Flying Tigers. St. Martin's Press, 335 pp.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1942, the AVG received a small number of Model E's, each equipped with a radio, six .50-caliber machine guns, and auxiliary bomb racks that could hold 35-lb fragmentation bombs. Chennault's armorer fitted the new planes with additional bomb racks that held the 570-lb Russian bombs, which the Chinese had in abundance. These planes were used in the battle of the [[Salween River]] Gorge in late May, 1942, which kept the Japanese from entering China from Burma and threatening Kunming. Spare parts were still a problem. \"Scores of new planes...were now in India, and there they stayed--in case the Japanese decided to invade... the AVG was lucky to get a few tires and spark plugs with which to carry on its daily war.\"<ref>Schultz, Duane. 1987.</ref>\n\n====4th Air Group====\nChina received 27 P-40E in early 1943.

[[Robert DeHaven]] scored 10 kills (of 14 overall) in the P-40 with the 49th FG. He compared the P-40 favorably with the P-38:\n:\"If you flew wisely, the P-40 was a very capable aircraft. [It] could outturn a P-38, a fact that some pilots didn't realize when they made the transition between the two aircraft. [...] The real problem with it was lack of range. As we pushed the Japanese back, P-40 pilots were slowly left out of the war. So when I moved to P-38s, an excellent aircraft, I did not [believe] that the P-40 was an inferior fighter, but because I knew the P-38 would allow us to reach the enemy.

Robert DeHaven describes how this tactic was used in the 49th Fighter group:\n:[Y]ou could fight a Jap on even terms, but you had to make him fight your way. He could outturn you at slow speed. You could outturn him at high speed. When you got into a turning fight with him, you dropped your nose down so you kept your airspeed up, you could outturn him. At low speed he could outroll you because of those big ailerons ... on the Zero. If your speed was up over 275, you could outroll [a Zero]. His big ailerons didn't have the strength to make high speed rolls... You could push things, too. Because ... [i]f you decided to go home, you could go home. He couldn't because you could outrun him.

The P-40 remained in use in the [[China Burma India Theater]] (CBI) until 1944 and was reportedly preferred over the P-51 Mustang by some US pilots flying in China. The American Volunteer Group (Flying Tigers) was integrated into the USAAF as the [[23rd Fighter Group]] in June 1942.

Decoded [[Ultra (World War II intelligence)|Ultra]] signals revealed a plan for a large formation of [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports to cross the Mediterranean, escorted by German and Italian fighters. Between 1630 and 1830 hours, all wings of the group were engaged in an intensive effort against the enemy air transports. Of the four Kittyhawk wings, three had left the patrol area before a convoy of a 100+ enemy transports were sighted by 57th FG, which tallied 74 aircraft destroyed. The group was last in the area, and intercepted the Ju 52s escorted by large numbers of Bf 109s, Bf 110s and [[Macchi C.202]]s. The group claimed 58 Ju 52s, 14 Bf 109s and two Bf 110s destroyed, with several probables and damaged. Between 20 and 40 of the Axis aircraft landed on the beaches around [[Cap Bon]] to avoid being shot down; six Allied fighters were lost, five of them P-40s.\n\nOn 22 April, in [[Operation Flax]], a similar force of P-40s attacked a formation of 14 [[Messerschmitt Me 323]] ''Gigant'' (\"Giant\") six-engine transports, covered by seven Bf 109s from II./JG 27.

Spitfire production was being absorbed by the war in Europe; P-38s were trialled, but were difficult to obtain; Mustangs had not yet reached squadrons anywhere, and Australia's tiny and inexperienced aircraft industry was geared towards larger aircraft. USAAF P-40s and their pilots originally intended for the [[United States Far East Air Force|U.S. Far East Air Force]] in the Philippines, but diverted to Australia as a result of Japanese naval activity were the first suitable fighter aircraft to arrive in substantial numbers. By mid-1942, the RAAF was able to obtain some USAAF replacement shipments; the P-40 was given the RAAF designation A-29.\n[[File:P02808.001 P-40 Black Magic.jpg|thumb|P-40N-15 \"Black Magic\", <br />[[No. 78 Squadron RAAF]] <br />[[Flight Lieutenant|F/L]] Denis Baker scored the RAAF's last aerial victory [[New Guinea campaign|over New Guinea]] in this fighter on 10 June 1944.

While the Spitfire was considered to have performed better, it was not available for use in Canada and the P-40 was ordered to meet home air defense requirements. In all, eight Home War Establishment Squadrons were equipped with the Kittyhawk: 72 Kittyhawk I, 12 Kittyhawk Ia, 15 Kittyhawk III and 35 Kittyhawk IV aircraft, for a total of 134 aircraft. These aircraft were mostly diverted from RAF Lend-Lease orders for service in Canada.

The 126th IAP fighting on the Western and Kalinin fronts were the first unit to receive the P-40. The regiment entered action on 12 October 1941. By 15 November 1941, that unit had shot down 17 German aircraft. However, Lt (SG) Smirnov noted that the P-40 armament was sufficient for strafing enemy lines but rather ineffective in aerial combat. Another pilot, S.G. Ridnyy (Hero of Soviet Union), remarked that he had to shoot half the ammunition at 50\u2013100 meters (164\u2013339&nbsp;ft) to shoot down an enemy aircraft.<ref name=\"Gordon p. 437\"/>\n\n[[File:P-40 B Tomahawk NMNA.jpg|thumb|left|Hawk 81A-3/Tomahawk IIb ''AK255'', at the U.S. [[National Museum of Naval Aviation]], is shown in the colors of the Flying Tigers, but never actually served with them; it began life with the RAF and was later transferred to the Soviet Union.]]\n\nIn January 1942, some 198 aircraft sorties were flown (334 flying hours) and 11 aerial engagements were conducted, in which five Bf 109s, one Ju 88, and one He 111 were downed. These statistics reveal a surprising fact: it turns out that the Tomahawk was fully capable of successful air combat with a Bf 109. The reports of pilots about the circumstances of the engagements confirm this fact. On 18 January 1942, Lieutenants S. V. Levin and I. P. Levsha (in pair) fought an engagement with seven Bf 109s and shot down two of them without loss. On 22 January, a flight of three aircraft led by Lieutenant E. E. Lozov engaged 13 enemy aircraft and shot down two Bf 109Es, again without loss. Altogether, in January, two Tomahawks were lost; one downed by German antiaircraft artillery and one lost to Messerschmitts.<ref name=\"Romanenko\"/>\n\nThe Soviets stripped down their P-40s significantly for combat, in many cases removing the wing guns altogether in P-40B/C types, for example. Soviet Air Force reports state that they liked the range and fuel capacity of the P-40, which were superior to most of the Soviet fighters, though they still preferred the P-39. Soviet pilot Nikolai G. Golodnikov recalled: \"The cockpit was vast and high. At first it felt unpleasant to sit waist-high in glass, as the edge of the fuselage was almost at waist level. But the bullet-proof glass and armored seat were strong and visibility was good. The radio was also good. It was powerful, reliable, but only on HF (high frequency). The American radios did not have hand microphones but throat microphones. These were good throat mikes: small, light and comfortable.\"<ref name=\"Drabkin p. 129\">Drabkin 2007, p. 129.</ref> The biggest complaint of some Soviet airmen was its poor climb rate and problems with maintenance, especially with burning out the engines. <!-- statement already made; is there need to repeat it?---Tomahawks' Allison engine was regarded as \"not very good but powerful as such\".

During the winter of 1941 the 126 IAP (Fighter Aviation Regiment), suffered from cracked radiators on 38 occasions. Often, entire regiments were reduced to a single flyable aircraft because no replacement parts were available.<ref>Mellinger 2006, pp. 24-25</ref> They also had difficulty with the more demanding requirements for fuel quality and oil purity of the Allison engines.

It was used in the northern sectors and played a significant role in the [[Siege of Leningrad|defense of Leningrad]]. The most numerically important types were P-40B/C, P-40E and P-40K/M. By the time the better P-40F and N types became available, production of superior Soviet fighters had increased sufficiently so that the P-40 was replaced in most Soviet Air Force units by the [[Lavochkin La-5]] and various later Yakovlev types. In spring 1943, Lt D.I. Koval of the 45th IAP gained ace status on the North-Caucasian front, shooting down six German aircraft flying a P-40. Some Soviet P-40 squadrons had good combat records. While Soviet pilots became aces on the P-40, not as many as on the P-39 Airacobra, which was the most numerous Lend Lease fighter used by the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Romanenko\"/> However Soviet commanders considered the Kittyhawk to significantly outclass the Hurricane, although it was \"not in the same league as the Yak-1\".<ref name=\"Drabkin p. 130\" /><ref name=\"Gordon p. 437-438\">Gordon 2008, pp. 437\u2013438.</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nThe [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese Army]] captured some P-40s and later operated a number in [[Myanmar|Burma]].

It flew for the first time in October 1938.\nThis new liquid-cooled engine fighter had a radiator mounted under the rear fuselage\nbut the prototype XP-40 was later modified and the radiator was moved forward under the engine.\n;P-40\n:The P-40 (Curtiss Model 81A-1) was the first production variant, 199 built.\n;P-40A\n:One P-40 was modified with a camera installation in the rear fuselage and re-designated P-40A.\n*Revised versions of the P-40 soon followed: the '''P-40B''' or '''Tomahawk IIA''' had extra .30&nbsp;in (7.62&nbsp;mm) U.S., or [[.303 British|.303 in]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) machine guns in the wings and a partially protected fuel system; the '''P-40C''' or '''Tomahawk IIB''' added underbelly drop tank and bomb shackles, self-sealing fuel tanks and other minor revisions, but the extra weight did have a negative impact on aircraft performance. (All versions of the P-40 had a relatively low [[power-to-weight ratio]] compared to contemporary fighters.)\n*Only a small number of '''P-40D''' or '''Kittyhawk Mk I'''s were made, less than 50. With a new, larger Allison engine, slightly narrower fuselage, redesigned canopy, and improved cockpit, the P-40D eliminated the nose-mounted .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns and instead had a pair of .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) guns in each wing. The distinctive chin airscoop grew larger so they could adequately cool the large Allison engine.\n*Retrospective designation for a single prototype. The '''P-40A''' was a single camera-carrying aircraft.\n*The '''P-40E''' or '''P-40E-1''' was similar in most respects to the P-40D, except for a slightly more powerful engine and an extra .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) gun in each wing, bringing the total to six. Some aircraft also had small underwing bomb shackles. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IA'''. The P-40E was the variant that bore the brunt of air-to-air combat by the type in the key period of early to mid 1942, for example with the first US squadrons to replace the AVG in China (the AVG was already transitioning to this type from the P-40B/C), the type used by the Australians at Milne Bay, by the New Zealand squadrons during most of their air-to-air combat, and by the RAF/Commonwealth in North Africa as the Kittyhawk IA.\n\n[[File:P40F Merlin.JPG|thumb|The Fighter Collection's P-40F G-CGZP, showing Merlin 500 engine.]]\n[[File:Curtiss P-40Fs near Moore AAF 1943.jpg|thumb|right|In the vicinity of [[Moore Field]], Texas.

Performance for these models at higher altitudes was better than their Allison-engined cousins. The L in some cases also featured a fillet in front of the [[vertical stabilizer]], or a stretched fuselage to compensate for the higher torque. The P-40L was sometimes nicknamed \"[[Gypsy Rose Lee]]\", after a famous stripper of the era, due to its stripped-down condition. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces under the designation '''Kittyhawk Mk II''', a total of 330 Mk IIs were supplied to the RAF under Lend-Lease. The first 230 aircraft are sometimes known as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IIA'''. The P-40F/L was extensively used by U.S. fighter groups operating in the Mediterranean Theater.\n*'''P-40G''' : 43 P-40 aircraft fitted with the wings of the Tomahawk Mk IIA. A total of 16 aircraft were supplied to the Soviet Union, and the rest to the US Army Air Forces. It was later redesignated '''RP-40G'''.\n*'''P-40K''', an Allison-engined P-40L, with the nose-top scoop retained and the Allison-configured nose radiators scoop, cowl flaps and vertical-stabilizer-to-fuselage fillet. Supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk III''', it was widely used by US units in the CBI.\n*'''P-40M''', version generally similar to the P-40K, with a stretched fuselage like the P-40L and powered by an Allison V-1710-81 engine giving better performance at altitude (compared to previous Allison versions). It had some detail improvements and it was characterized by two small air scoops just before the exhaust pipes. Most of them were supplied to Allied countries (mainly UK and USSR), while some others remained in the USA for advanced training. It was also supplied to the Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk. III'''.\n*'''P-40N''' (manufactured 1943\u201344), the final production model. The P-40N featured a stretched rear fuselage to counter the torque of the more powerful, late-war Allison engine, and the rear deck of the cockpit behind the pilot was cut down at a moderate slant to improve rearward visibility. A great deal of work was also done to try and eliminate excess weight to improve the Warhawk's climb rate. Early N production blocks dropped a .50&nbsp;in (12.7&nbsp;mm) gun from each wing, bringing the total back to four; later production blocks reintroduced it after complaints from units in the field. Supplied to Commonwealth air forces as the '''Kittyhawk Mk IV'''. A total of 553 P-40Ns were acquired by the Royal Australian Air Force, making it the variant most commonly used by the RAAF. Subvariants of the P-40N ranged widely in specialization from stripped down four-gun \"hot rods\" that could reach the highest top speeds of any production variant of the P-40 (up to 380&nbsp;mph), to overweight types with all the extras intended for fighter-bombing or even training missions. The 15,000th P-40 was an N model decorated with the markings of 28 nations that had employed any of Curtiss-Wright's various aircraft products, not just P-40s. \"These spectacular markings gave rise to the erroneous belief that the P-40 series had been used by all 28 countries.\"<ref>McDowell 1968, p. 68.</ref> Since the P-40N was by 1944 used mainly as a ground attack aircraft in Europe, it was nicknamed '''B-40''' by pilots.<ref>Vader 1970, p. 137.</ref> Survivors redesignated as ZF-40N in June 1948.\n[[File:Curtiss P-40N.jpg|thumb|Curtiss P-40N Warhawk \"Little Jeanne\" in flight.]]\n*'''P-40P''' : The designation of 1,500 aircraft ordered with V-1650-1 engines, but actually built as the P-40N with V-1710-81 engines.\n*'''XP-40Q''' : Three P-40N modified with a 4-bladed prop, cut-down rear fuselage and [[bubble canopy]], four guns, squared-off wingtips and tail surfaces, and improved engine with two-speed supercharger.

It was based on Christian understanding of the [[Canonical Gospels]], the letters of the [[New Testament]] and to a lesser extent the [[Old Testament]]. Affirmation of this creed, which describes the [[Trinity]], is generally taken as a fundamental test of [[orthodoxy]] for most [[Christian denominations]].<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Johnson, Phillip R. \"The Nicene Creed.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009</ref> The [[Apostles' Creed]] is also broadly accepted. Some Christian denominations and other groups have rejected the [[#Christians without creeds|authority of those creeds]].\n\n[[Muslim]]s declare the ''[[shahada]]'', or testimony: \"I bear witness that there is no god but (the One) God ''([[Allah]])'', and I bear witness that [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] is God's messenger.\"<ref>[http://www.islamiclearningmaterials.com/shahada.html \"Proclaiming the Shahada is the First Step Into Islam.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303214355/http://islamiclearningmaterials.com/shahada.html |date=2009-03-03 }} Islamic Learning Materials.

Accessed: 28 May 2012</ref>\n\nWhether Judaism is creedal has been a point of some controversy. Although some say Judaism is noncreedal in nature, others say it recognizes a single creed, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'', which begins: \"Hear, O Israel: the {{Lord}} our God, the {{Lord}} is one.\"<ref>{{bibleverse||Deut|6:4|HE}}</ref>\n\n==Terminology==\n{{see also|Credo}}\nThe word ''creed'' is particularly used for a concise statement which is recited as part of [[liturgy]]. The term is anglicized from Latin ''credo'' \"I believe\", the [[incipit]] of the Latin texts of the [[Apostles' Creed]] and the [[Nicene Creed]]. A creed is sometimes referred to as a ''symbol'' in a specialized meaning of that word (which was first introduced to [[Late Middle English]] in this sense), after Latin ''symbolum'' \"creed\" (as in ''[[Symbolum Apostolorum]]'' = \"Apostles' Creed\"), after Greek ''symbolon'' \"token, watchword\".<ref>Justo L. Gonzalez, ''The Story of Christianity'', 2nd ed., Vol. 1, p. 77.</ref>\n\nSome longer statements of faith in the [[Protestant]] tradition are instead called \"confessions of faith\", or simply \"confession\" (as in e.g. [[Helvetic Confession]]).\nWithin [[Evangelicalism]], the terms \"doctrinal statement\" or \"doctrinal basis\" tend to be preferred. Doctrinal statements may include positions on [[lectionary]] and [[translations of the Bible]], particularly in [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] churches of the [[King James Only movement]].\n\nThe term ''creed'' is sometimes extended to comparable concepts in non-Christian theologies; thus the Islamic concept of ''[[\u02bfAq\u012bdah|\u02bfaq\u012bdah]]'' (literally \"bond, tie\") is often rendered as \"creed\".\n\n==Christian creeds==\n{{main|List of Christian creeds}}\nSeveral creeds have originated in [[Christianity]].\n* [[1 Corinthians 15]], 3\u20137 includes an early creed about Jesus' death and resurrection which was probably received by Paul. The antiquity of the creed has been located by most biblical scholars to no more than five years after Jesus' death, probably originating from the [[Early centers of Christianity#Jerusalem|Jerusalem apostolic community]].<ref>see Wolfhart Pannenberg, Jesus\u2014God and Man translated Lewis Wilkins and Duane Pribe (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1968) p. 90; Oscar Cullmann, The Early church: Studies in Early Christian History and Theology, ed.

It was based on the 2nd century Rules of Faith and the interrogatory declaration of faith for those receiving [[baptism]], which by the 4th century was everywhere tripartite in structure, following Matthew 28:19.\n* The [[Apostles' Creed]] is widely used by most [[Christian denominations]] for both [[liturgy|liturgical]] and [[catechetical]] purposes.\n* The [[Nicene Creed]] reflects the concerns of the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 which had as their chief purpose to establish what Christians believed.<ref>[http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm Kiefer, James E. \"The Nicene Creed.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314061400/http://www.spurgeon.org/~phil/creeds/nicene.htm |date=2009-03-14 }} Accessed 17 May 2009</ref>\n* The [[Chalcedonian Creed]] was adopted at the Council of Chalcedon in 451 in Asia Minor. It defines that Christ is 'acknowledged in two natures', which 'come together into one person and hypostasis'.\n* The [[Athanasian Creed]] (''Quicumque vult'') is a Christian statement of belief focusing on Trinitarian doctrine and Christology. It is the first creed in which the equality of the three persons of the Trinity is explicitly stated and differs from the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds in the inclusion of anathemas, or condemnations of those who disagree with the Creed.\n* The [[Tridentine Creed]] was initially contained in the [[papal bull]] ''[[Iniunctum Nobis]]'', issued by [[Pope Pius IV]] on November 13, 1565.  The creed was intended to summarize the teaching of the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563).\n* The [[Maasai Creed]] is a creed composed in  1960 by the [[Maasai people]] of East Africa in collaboration with  missionaries  from the [[Holy Ghost Fathers|Congregation of the Holy Ghost]].

Pope Paul VI spoke of it as \"a profession of faith, ... a creed which, without being strictly speaking a dogmatic definition, repeats in substance, with some developments called for by the spiritual condition of our time, the [[Nicene Creed|creed of Nicea]], the creed of the immortal tradition of the holy Church of God.\"\n\n==Christian confessions of faith==\nProtestant denominations are usually associated with confessions of faith, which are similar to creeds but usually longer.\n* The ''Sixty-seven Articles'' of the Swiss reformers, drawn up by [[Zwingli]] in 1523;\n* The ''[[Schleitheim Confession]]'' of the [[Anabaptist]] [[Swiss Brethren]] drawn up in 1527 \u2013 (being Anabaptist, this confession was not Protestant in the usual sense);\n* The ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'' of 1530, the work of [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philip Melanchthon]], which marked the breach with [[Rome]];\n* The ''[[Tetrapolitan Confession]]'' of the [[German Reformed Church]], 1530;\n* The ''[[Smalcald Articles]]'' of Martin Luther, 1537\n* The ''[[Guanabara Confession of Faith]]'', 1558, the first Protestant writing in the Americas.

Nor did they understand that the tighter and more specific their words became, the less they would achieve the task of unifying the church.

DeVoto, ''Claudius Aelianus: \u03a0\u03bf\u03b9\u03f0\u03af\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u1f39\u03bf\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 (\"Varia Historia\")'' Chicago, 1995; Diane Ostrom Johnson, ''An English Translation of Claudius Aelianus' \"Varia Historia\"'', 1997; and N. G. Wilson, ''Aelian: Historical Miscellany'' in the [[Loeb Classical Library]].\n\n==Other works==\nConsiderable fragments of two other works, ''On Providence'' and ''Divine Manifestations'', are preserved in the early medieval encyclopedia, the ''[[Suda]].''  Twenty \"letters from a farmer\" after the manner of [[Alciphron]] are also attributed to him.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/> The letters are invented compositions to a fictitious correspondent, which are a device for vignettes of agricultural and rural life, set in Attica, though mellifluous Aelian once boasted that he had never been outside Italy, never been aboard a ship (which is at variance, though, with his own statement, ''de Natura Animalium'' XI.40, that he had seen the bull [[Serapis]] with his own eyes). Thus conclusions about actual agriculture in the ''Letters'' are as likely to evoke [[Latium]] as [[Attica]]. The fragments have been edited in 1998 by D. Domingo-Foraste, but are not available in English. The ''Letters'' are available in the Loeb Classical Library, translated by Allen Rogers Benner and Francis H. Fobes (1949).\n\n==See also==\n*[[Historiae animalium (Gesner)|''Historiae animalium'' by Gessner]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Aelian, ''On Animals''. 3 volumes.

But to have sex with her, Zeus disguised himself as Artemis ([[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]) herself, in order to lure her into his embrace. Callisto was then turned into a [[bear]], as [[Hesiod]] described:\n\n<blockquote>...but afterwards, when she was already with child, was seen bathing and so discovered. Upon this, the goddess was enraged and changed her into a beast. Thus she became a bear and gave birth to a son called Arcas.</blockquote>\n\nEither Artemis \"slew Kallisto with a shot of her silver bow,\"<ref>''[[Homer#Works ascribed to Homer|Homerica, The Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', 316 ff (trans. Hugh G. Evelyn-White).</ref> perhaps urged by the wrath of [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] ([[Hera]])<ref>This was the version current in Greece when Pausanias visited in the second century CE ([[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], VIII.35.8).</ref> or later [[Arcas]], the eponym of [[Arcadia]], nearly killed his bear-mother, when she had wandered into the [[Temenos|forbidden precinct]] of Zeus. In every case, Zeus placed them both in the sky as the [[constellation]]s [[Ursa Major]], called ''Arktos'' (\u03b1\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2), the \"Bear\", by Greeks, and [[Ursa Minor]].\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Diana and Callisto - WGA20326.jpg|thumb|[[Diana and Callisto (Rubens)|''Diana and Callisto'']] by [[Rubens]], c. 1635]]\n\nAccording to [[Ovid]],<ref>Ovid. ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]''. Book II, Lines 405\u2013531; Ovid narrates the myth also in ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', book II.</ref> it was [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Zeus) who took the form of Diana (Artemis) so that he might evade his wife Juno\u2019s detection, forcing himself upon Callisto while she was separated from Diana and the other nymphs.<ref>The transformation of Zeus, with its [[lesbian]] overtones, was rendered as comedy in a lost work by the Attic Amphis ([http://www.theoi.com/Heroine/Kallisto.html Theoi Project \u2013 Kallisto]).</ref> Callisto's subsequent pregnancy was discovered several months later while she was bathing with Diana and her fellow nymphs. Diana became enraged when she saw that Callisto was pregnant and expelled her from the group.  Callisto later gave birth to [[Arcas]]. Juno then took the opportunity to avenge her wounded pride and transformed the nymph into a bear. Sixteen years later Callisto, still a bear, encountered her son Arcas hunting in the forest. Just as Arcas was about to kill his own mother with his javelin, Jupiter averted the tragedy by placing mother and son amongst the stars as [[Ursa Major]] and [[Ursa Minor|Minor]], respectively. Juno, enraged that her attempt at revenge had been frustrated, appealed to [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] that the two might never meet her waters, thus providing a poetic explanation for their [[circumpolar star|circumpolar]] positions in ancient times (see below).\n\n==In art==\n[[File:Callisto - Par Gillis CONGNET.jpg|thumb|[[Gillis Coignet]], 1580]]\nCallisto's story was sometimes depicted in [[classical art]], where the moment of transformation into a bear was the most popular.<ref>Gods</ref>  From the Renaissance on a series of major [[history painting]]s as well as many smaller [[cabinet painting]]s and book illustrations, usually called \"Diana and Callisto\", depicted the traumatic moment of discovery of the pregnancy, as the goddess and her nymphs bathed in a pool, following [[Ovid]]'s account.  The subject's attraction was undoubtedly mainly the opportunity it offered for a group of several females to be shown largely nude.<ref>There is a good but by no means complete, selection at [http://iconographic.warburg.sas.ac.uk/vpc/VPC_search/subcats.php?cat_1=5&cat_2=244&cat_3=2345&cat_4=3995 Warburg Institute Iconographic Database, Myths \u2192 Callisto's pregnancy discovered by Diana]; more on Wikimedia Commons</ref> \n\n[[Titian]]'s ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'' (1556-1559), was the greatest (though not the first) of these, quickly disseminated by a print by [[Cornelius Cort]].<ref>Brigstocke, 184</ref>  Here, as in most subsequent depictions, Diana points angrily, as Callisto is held by two nymphs, who may be pulling off what little clothing remains on her.  Other versions include [[Diana and Callisto (Rubens)|one by Rubens]], and ''[[Diana Bathing with her Nymphs with Actaeon and Callisto]]'' by [[Rembrandt]], which unusually combines the moment with the arrival of [[Actaeon]].<ref>Hall, Gods</ref>  The basic composition is rather unusually consistent.  [[Carlo Ridolfi]] said there was a version by [[Giorgione]], who died in 1510, though his many attributions to Giorgione of paintings that are now lost are treated with suspicion by scholars.<ref>Jane Martineau (ed), ''The Genius of Venice, 1500\u20131600'', 207, 1983, Royal Academy of Arts, London</ref>  Other, less dramatic, treatments before Titian established his composition are by [[Palma Vecchio]] and [[Dosso Dossi]].\n\nAlthough Ovid places the discovery in the ninth month of Callisto's pregnancy, in paintings she is generally shown with a rather modest bump for late pregnancy.  With the ''[[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]]'' in religious art, this was the leading recurring subject in history painting that required showing [[pregnancy in art]], which [[Early Modern]] painters still approached with some caution.  In any case, the narrative required that the rest of the group had not previously noticed the pregnancy.\n\nCallisto being seduced by Zeus/Jupiter in disguise was also a popular subject, usually called \"Jupiter and Callisto\"; it was the clearest common subject with lesbian lovers from classical mythology.  The two lovers are usually shown happily embracing in a bower. The violent rape described by Ovid as following Callisto's realization of what is going on is rarely shown.  In versions before about 1700 Callisto may show some doubt about what is going on, as in the versions by Rubens. It was especially popular in the 18th century, when depictions were increasingly erotic; [[Fran\u00e7ois Boucher]] painted several versions.<ref>Hall, Gods</ref>\n\n[[Aeschylus]]' tragedy ''Callisto'' is lost.\n\n==Origin of the myth==\n[[File:Karel Philips Spierincks - Jupiter and Callisto.jpg|thumb|left|330px|''Jupiter and Callisto'' by [[Karel Philips Spierincks]]. In the background Jupiter's jealous wife Juno is dragging Callisto by the hair.]]\nThe name ''Kalliste'' (\u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7), \"most beautiful\", may be recognized as an [[epithet]] of the goddess herself, though none of the inscriptions at Athens that record priests of ''Artemis Kalliste'' (\u0386\u03c1\u03c4\u03b5\u03bc\u03b9\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7), date before the third century BCE.<ref>Daniel J. Geagan. \"The Athenian Constitution After Sulla\" (''Hesperia Supplements'' '''12''' 1967:72, 95).</ref> Artemis Kalliste was worshiped in Athens in a shrine which lay outside the Dipylon gate, by the side of the road to the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]].<ref>''Klio: Beitr\u00e4ge Zur Alten Geschichte'' (Deutsche Akademie der Wissenschaften Zu Berlin Institut f\u00fcr Griechisch-R\u00f6mische Altertumskunde) 1907.</ref> W. S. Ferguson suggested<ref>In ''Klio'' '''7''' (1907:213f).</ref> that Artemis Soteira and Artemis Kalliste were joined in a common cult administered by a single priest. The bearlike character of Artemis herself was a feature of the [[Brauronia]].\n\nThe myth in ''[[Catasterismi]]'' may be derived from the fact that a set of constellations appear close together in the sky, in and near the [[Zodiac]] sign of [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], namely Ursa Minor, Ursa Major, [[Bo\u00f6tes]], and [[Virgo (constellation)|Virgo]]. The [[Bo\u00f6tes|constellation Bo\u00f6tes]], was explicitly identified in the Hesiodic ''Astronomia'' (\u0391\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b1)<ref>Hesiod, ''Astronomia'', fragment 3, preserved as a quote in a commentary on [[Aratus]].</ref> as Arcas, the \"Bear-warden\" (''Arktophylax''; \u0391\u03c1\u03ba\u03c4\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03b1\u03be):<ref>Thus Hesiod is quoted, though Bo\u00f6tes, \u0392\u03bf\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2, from his very name, is a ''cow'' (\u03b2\u03bf\u03c9\u03c2) herdsman.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>He is Arkas the son of Kallisto and Zeus, and he lived in the country about Lykaion. After Zeus had seduced Kallisto, Lykaon, pretending not to know of the matter, entertained Zeus, as Hesiod says, and set before him on the table the babe [Arkas] which he had cut up.<ref>The episode is a doublet of the serving up of [[Pelops]].</ref></blockquote>\n[[File:Sebastiano Ricci - Diana and Callisto - WGA19416.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastiano Ricci]], ''Diana and Callisto'', 1712-16]]\nThe stars of Ursa Major were all circumpolar in Athens of 400 BCE, and all but the stars in the Great Bear's left foot were circumpolar in Ovid's Rome, in the first century CE. Now, however, due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]], the feet of the Great Bear constellation do sink below the horizon from Rome and especially from Athens; however, Ursa Minor (Arcas) does remain completely above the horizon, even from latitudes as far south as Honolulu and Hong Kong.\n\nAccording to Julien d'Huy, who used phylogenetic and statistical tools, the story could be a recent transformation of a Palaeolithic myth.<ref>d'Huy Julien, Un ours dans les \u00e9toiles: recherche phylog\u00e9n\u00e9tique Sur un mythe pr\u00e9historique.

It also gives an alternative etymology: like the American word, from the Dutch ''koekje'', the diminutive of ''koek'', a cake. There was much trade and cultural contact across the [[North Sea]] between the [[Low Countries]] and Scotland during the [[Middle Ages]], which can also be seen in the [[history of curling]] and, perhaps, [[History of golf|golf]].\n\n==Description==\n[[File:R\u016fzn\u00e9 druhy cukrov\u00ed (2).jpg|thumb|right|A dish of assorted cookies, including [[sandwich cookies]] filled with [[jam]].]]\nCookies are most commonly baked until crisp or just long enough that they remain soft, but some kinds of cookies are not baked at all. Cookies are made in a wide variety of styles, using an array of ingredients including sugars, [[spice]]s, chocolate, [[butter]], [[peanut butter]], [[nut (fruit)|nut]]s, or dried [[fruit]]s. The softness of the cookie may depend on how long it is baked.\n\nA general theory of cookies may be formulated this way. Despite its descent from cakes and other sweetened breads, the cookie in almost all its forms has abandoned water as a medium for cohesion. Water in cakes serves to make the base (in the case of cakes called \"batter\"<ref>''Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary'', Tenth Edition. Merriam-Webster, Inc.: 1999.</ref>) as thin as possible, which allows the bubbles \u2013 responsible for a cake's fluffiness \u2013 to better form. In the cookie, the agent of cohesion has become some form of oil. Oils, whether they be in the form of butter, vegetable oils, or lard, are much more viscous than water and evaporate freely at a much higher temperature than water. Thus a cake made with butter or eggs instead of water is far denser after removal from the oven.\n\nOils in baked cakes do not behave as soda tends to in the finished result. Rather than evaporating and thickening the mixture, they remain, saturating the bubbles of escaped gases from what little water there might have been in the eggs, if added, and the [[carbon dioxide]] released by heating the baking powder. This saturation produces the most texturally attractive feature of the cookie, and indeed all fried foods: crispness saturated with a moisture (namely oil) that does not sink into it.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Thumbprint Cookies (7712226646).jpg|thumb|left|Thumbprint Cookies]]\nCookie-like hard wafers have existed for as long as baking is documented, in part because they deal with travel very well, but they were usually not sweet enough to be considered cookies by modern standards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html|title=The Food Timeline: history notes--cookies, crackers & biscuits|author=Lynne Olver|work=foodtimeline.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717061521/http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodcookies.html|archivedate=2012-07-17|df=}}</ref>\n\nCookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD [[Persia]], shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region.<ref name=\"whatscookingamerica\">{{cite web |url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm |title=History of Cookies - Cookie History |publisher=Whatscookingamerica.net |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081104004501/http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/CookieHistory.htm |archivedate=2008-11-04 |df= }}</ref> They spread to Europe through the [[Muslim conquest of Spain]].

[[Oatmeal cluster]]s and [[Rum ball]]s are no-bake cookies.\n* ''Pressed cookies'' are made from a soft dough that is extruded from a [[cookie press]] into various decorative shapes before baking. [[Spritzgeb\u00e4ck]] are an example of a pressed cookie.\n* ''Refrigerator cookies'' (also known as ''icebox cookies'') are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to make the raw dough even stiffer before cutting and baking.

Specifically mentioned in the RFC are the following contributors:<ref name=\"rfc-3875\"/>\n\n* [[Rob McCool]] (author of the [[NCSA HTTPd]] [[HTTP Server|Web Server]])\n* John Franks (author of the GN Web Server)\n* [[Ari Luotonen]] (the developer of the [[CERN httpd]] Web Server)\n* Tony Sanders (author of the Plexus Web Server)\n* George Phillips (Web server maintainer at the [[University of British Columbia]])\n\nHistorically CGI scripts were often written using the C language. RFC 3875 \"The Common Gateway Interface (CGI)\" partially defines CGI using C,<ref name=\"rfc-3875\"/> as in saying that environment variables \"are accessed by the C library routine getenv() or variable environ\".\n\nThe name CGI comes from the early days of the web, where users wanted to connect to databases to their web servers. The CGI was a program executed by the server that provided a common \"gateway\" between the web server and the database.\n\n== Purpose of the CGI standard ==\nEach [[web server]] runs [[HTTP]] server software, which responds to requests from [[Web_browser|web browsers]]. Generally, the HTTP server has a [[Directory_(computing)|directory (folder)]], which is designated as a document collection \u2014 files that can be sent to Web browsers connected to this server.<ref>[http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/urlmapping.html Mapping URLs to Filesystem Locations Apache HTTP Server Version 2.2]</ref> For example, if the Web server has the domain name <code>example.com</code>, and its document collection is stored at <code>/usr/local/apache/htdocs</code> in the local file system, then the Web server will respond to a request for <code><nowiki>http://example.com/index.html</nowiki></code> by sending to the browser the (pre-written) file <code>/usr/local/apache/htdocs/index.html</code>.\n\nFor pages constructed on the fly, the server software may defer requests to separate programs and relay the results to the requesting client (usually, a web browser that displays the page to the end user).  In the early days of the web, such programs were usually small and written in a scripting language; hence, they were known as ''scripts''.\n\nSuch programs usually require some additional information to be specified with the request. For instance, if Wikipedia were implemented as a script, one thing the script would need to know is whether the user is logged in and, if logged in, under which name.  The content at the top of a Wikipedia page depends on this information.\n\nHTTP provides ways for browsers to pass such information to the web server, e.g. as part of the URL. The server software must then pass this information through to the script somehow.\n\nConversely, upon returning, the script must provide all the information required by HTTP for a response to the request: the HTTP status of the request, the document content (if available), the document type (e.g. HTML, PDF, or plain text), et cetera.\n\nInitially, different server software would use different ways to exchange this information with scripts. As a result, it wasn't possible to write scripts that would work unmodified for different server software, even though the information being exchanged was the same.  Therefore, it was decided to establish a standard way for exchanging this information: CGI (the ''Common Gateway Interface'', as it defines a common way for server software to interface with scripts).\nWebpage generating programs invoked by server software that operate according to the CGI standard are known as ''CGI scripts''.\n\nThis standard was quickly adopted and is still supported by all well-known server software, such as [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], and (with an extension) [[node.js]]-based servers.\n\nAn early use of CGI scripts was to process forms. In the beginning of HTML, HTML forms typically had an \"action\" attribute and a button designated as the \"submit\" button. When the submit button is pushed the URI specified in the \"action\" attribute would be sent to the server with the data from the form sent as a query string. If the \"action\" specifies a CGI script then the CGI script would be executed and it then produces an HTML page.\n\n== Using CGI scripts ==\nA web server allows its owner to configure which URLs shall be handled by which CGI scripts.\n\nThis is usually done by marking a new directory within the document collection as containing CGI scripts \u2014 its name is often <code>cgi-bin</code>. For example, <code>/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin</code> could be designated as a CGI directory on the web server. When a Web browser requests a URL that points to a file within the CGI directory (e.g., <code><nowiki>http://example.com/cgi-bin/printenv.pl/with/additional/path?and=a&query=string</nowiki></code>), then, instead of simply sending that file (<code>/usr/local/apache/htdocs/cgi-bin/printenv.pl</code>) to the Web browser, the HTTP server runs the specified script and passes the output of the script to the Web browser. That is, anything that the script sends to [[standard output]] is passed to the Web client instead of being shown on-screen in a terminal window.\n\nAs remarked above, the CGI standard defines how additional information passed with the request is passed to the script.\nFor instance, if a slash and additional directory name(s) are appended to the URL immediately after the name of the script (in this example, <code>/with/additional/path</code>), then that path is stored in the <code>PATH_INFO</code> [[environment variable]] before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an [[HTTP GET]] request (a question mark appended to the URL, followed by param=value pairs; in the example, <code>?and=a&query=string</code>), then those parameters are stored in the <code>QUERY_STRING</code> environment variable before the script is called. If parameters are sent to the script via an [[HTTP POST]] request, they are passed to the script's [[standard input]].

A common convention is to have a <code>cgi-bin/</code> [[Directory (computing)|directory]] at the base of the directory tree and treat all executable files within this directory (and no other, for security) as CGI scripts. Another popular convention is to use [[filename extension]]s; for instance, if CGI scripts are consistently given the extension <code>.cgi</code>, the web server can be configured to interpret all such files as CGI scripts. While convenient, and required by many prepackaged scripts, it opens the server to attack if a remote user can upload executable code with the proper extension.\n\nIn the case of [[HTTP#Request methods|HTTP PUT or POSTs]], the user-submitted data are provided to the program via the [[standard input]]. The Web server creates a subset of the [[environment variable]]s passed to it and adds details pertinent to the HTTP environment.\n\n== Uses ==\nCGI is often used to process inputs information from the user and produce the appropriate output. An example of a CGI program is one implementing a [[Wiki]]. The user agent requests the name of an entry; the Web server executes the CGI; the CGI program retrieves the source of that entry's page (if one exists), transforms it into [[HTML]], and prints the result. The web server receives the input from the CGI and transmits it to the user agent. If the \"Edit this page\" link is clicked, the CGI populates an HTML <code>textarea</code> or other editing control with the page's contents, and saves it back to the server when the user submits the form in it.\n\n== Alternatives ==\nCalling a command generally means the invocation of a newly created [[Process (computing)|process]] on the server. Starting the process can consume much more time and memory than the actual work of generating the output, especially when the program still needs to be [[interpret]]ed or [[compiler|compiled]].\nIf the command is called often, the resulting workload can quickly overwhelm the server.\n\nThe [[computational overhead|overhead]] involved in process creation can be reduced by techniques such as [[FastCGI]] that \"prefork\" interpreter processes, or by running the application code entirely within the web server, using extension modules such as [[mod_perl]] or [[mod_php]]. Another way to reduce the overhead is to use precompiled CGI programs, e.g. by writing them in languages such as [[C (programming language)|C]] or [[C++]], rather than interpreted or compiled-on-the-fly languages such as [[Perl]] or [[PHP]], or by implementing the page generating software as a custom webserver module.\n\nAlternative approaches include:\n\n* Extensions such as [[Apache modules]], [[Netscape Server Application Programming Interface|NSAPI]] plugins, and [[ISAPI]] plugins allow third-party software to run on the web server.\n* [[FastCGI]] reduces overhead by allowing a single, long-running process to handle more than one user request. Unlike converting an application to a web server plug-in, FastCGI applications remain independent of the web server.\n* [[Simple Common Gateway Interface]] or SCGI is designed to be easier to implement, yet it reduces latency in some operations compared to CGI. \n* Replacement of the architecture for dynamic websites can also be used. This is the approach taken by [[Java EE]], which runs Java code in a Java servlet container in order to serve dynamic content and optionally static content. This approach replaces the overhead of generating and destroying processes with the much lower overhead of generating and destroying [[Thread (computer science)|threads]], and also exposes the programmer to the library that comes with [[Java Platform, Standard Edition]] on which the version of Java EE in use is based.\n\nThe optimal configuration for any Web application depends on application-specific details, amount of traffic, and complexity of the transaction; these tradeoffs need to be analyzed to determine the best implementation for a given task and time budget.  [[Web_framework|Web Frameworks]] offer an alternative to using CGI scripts to interact with user agents.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[CGI.pm]]\n* [[FastCGI]]\n* [[Perl Web Server Gateway Interface]]\n* [[Rack (web server interface)]]\n* [[Web Server Gateway Interface]]\n* [[DOS Gateway Interface]] (DGI)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.gnu.org/software/cgicc/ GNU cgicc], a C++ class library for writing CGI applications\n* [https://metacpan.org/pod/CGI CGI], a standard Perl module for CGI request parsing and HTML response generation\n* [http://www.cgi101.com/learn/ CGI Programming 101: Learn CGI Today!], a CGI tutorial\n\n{{Web interfaces}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Category:Servers (computing)]]\n[[Category:Web 1.0]]\n[[Category:Web technology]]\n[[Category:World Wide Web]]", "sha1": "ji3b0hyw5xsm8z6fsghntciu7qecj6q"}}, {"title": "Choctaw", "ns": "0", "id": "7222", "revision": {"id": "865678601", "parentid": "865678216", "timestamp": "2018-10-25T13:38:13Z", "contributor": {"username": "CASSIOPEIA", "id": "31051948"}, "minor": "", "comment": "Reverted edits by [[Special:Contributions/107.0.42.254|107.0.42.254]] ([[User talk:107.0.42.254|talk]]) ([[WP:HG|HG]]) (3.4.4)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Infobox ethnic group\n|group         = Choctaw\n| native_name      = Chahta\n| native_name_lang = \n|population    = 160,000 (2005)<ref name=\"census\">{{Cite journal |title=American Indian, Alaska Native Tables from the Statistical Abstract of the United States |journal=Statistical Abstract of the United States: 2004\u20132005 |issue=124th ed. |pages= |publisher=[[US Census Bureau]] |url=https://www.census.gov/statab/www/sa04aian.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211064810/http://www.census.gov/statab/www/sa04aian.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2005-02-11 |accessdate=2007-09-20 |format=PDF |df= }}</ref>\n|regions       = [[United States]]<br/>{{smaller|([[Oklahoma]], [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Louisiana]],  [[Texas]], [[Alabama]])}}\n|languages     = [[American English]], [[Choctaw language|Choctaw]]\n|religions     = [[Protestant]], [[Roman Catholic]], traditional beliefs\n|related       = [[Chickasaw]], [[Creek people|Muscogee (Creek)]], and later [[Seminole]]\n|image         = Louisiana Indians Walking Along a Bayou.jpg \n|caption       = ''Louisiana Indians Walking Along a Bayou'' [[Alfred Boisseau]] \u2013 1847 \n}}\n\nThe '''Choctaw''' (in the [[Choctaw language]], '''''Chahta''''')<ref group=\"note\">Common misspellings and variations in other languages include '''Chacta''',{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} '''Tchakta'''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and '''Chocktaw'''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}.</ref> are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people originally occupying what is now the [[Southeastern United States]] (modern-day [[Alabama]], [[Florida]], [[Mississippi]], and [[Louisiana]]).

These different groups sometimes created distinct, independent alliances with nearby European powers. These included the [[French colonization of the Americas|French]], based on the Gulf Coast and in Louisiana; the [[English colonization of the Americas|English]] of the Southeast, and the Spanish of Florida and Louisiana during the colonial era. During the [[American Revolution]], most Choctaw supported the [[Thirteen Colonies]]' bid for independence from the [[British Empire|British Crown]]. They never went to war against the United States but they were forcibly relocated in 1831-1833, as part of the [[Indian Removal]], in order for the US to take over their land for development by European Americans.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Choctaw were classified by European Americans as one of the \"[[Five Civilized Tribes]]\" because they adopted numerous practices of their United States neighbors. The Choctaw and the United States (US) agreed to nine treaties. By the last three, the US gained vast land cessions; they [[Indian Removal|removed]] most Choctaw west of the [[Mississippi River]] to [[Indian Territory]], sending them on a forced migration far from their homelands.  The Choctaw were the first Native American tribe forced to relocate under the [[Indian Removal Act]].

They appointed a Choctaw Delegate to represent them to the US government in Washington, DC.\n\nBy the 1831 [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]], those Choctaw who chose to stay in the newly formed state of Mississippi were to be considered state and U.S. citizens; they were one of the first major non-European ethnic groups to be granted citizenship.<ref name=us_citizenship>\n{{Cite web\n| url        = http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/cho0310.htm\n| title      = INDIAN AFFAIRS: LAWS AND TREATIES Vol. II, Treaties\n| accessdate = 2008-02-19\n| authorlink = Charles Kappler\n| last       = Kappler\n| first      = Charles\n| year       = 1904\n| publisher  = Government Printing Office\n}}\n</ref><ref name=david_baird>\n{{Cite book\n | last      = Baird\n | first     = David\n | title     = The Choctaw People\n | publisher = Indian Tribal Series\n | location  = United States\n | chapter   = The Choctaws Meet the Americans, 1783 to 1843\n | page      = 36\n | lccn      = 73-80708\n | year  = 1973\n}}\n</ref><ref name=nrc_programs>\n{{Cite web\n| url        = http://www.nrcprograms.org/site/PageServer?pagename=cin_hist_citizenshipact\n| title      = History & Culture, Citizenship Act \u2013 1924\n| accessdate = 2008-05-02\n| author     = Council of Indian Nations\n| year       = 2005\n| publisher  = Council of Indian Nations\n}}\n</ref> Article 14 in the 1830 treaty with the Choctaw stated Choctaws may wish to become citizens of the United States under the 14th Article of the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek on all of the combined lands which were consolidated under Article I from all previous treaties between the United States and the Choctaw.<ref>Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek September 30th 1830 ratified on February 24th 1831 (7 Stat. 333)</ref>\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], the Choctaw in both [[Oklahoma]] and Mississippi mostly sided with the [[Confederate States of America]]. The Confederacy had suggested to their leaders that it would support a state under Indian control if it won the war.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Mississippi, Alabama, and Louisiana Choctaw fell into obscurity for some time. The Choctaw in Oklahoma no longer considered the Mississippi Choctaw part of the Choctaw Nation. However, [[Jack Amos (Mississippi Choctaw)|Jack Amos]] legally challenged the Choctaw Nation's stance at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIn 1978, the United Supreme Court of the United States held that all remnants of the Choctaw Nation are entitled to all rights of the federally recognized Nation.<ref>''[[United States v. John (1978)|United States v. John]]'' 436 U.S. 637 (1978)</ref> The American Indian Policy Review Commission Final Report Volume I, Chapter 11, Page 468 on May 19, 1977 federally acknowledged/recognized the existence of the Choctaw Communities of Mobile and Washington Counties which are along the Tombigbee and Mobile Rivers where Choctaw Treaties were negotiated in various Choctaw Treaties.\n\nThe Choctaw in Oklahoma struggled to build a nation. They transferred the Choctaw Academy there and opened an academy for girls in the 1840s. In the aftermath of the [[Dawes Act]] in the late 19th century, the US dissolved tribal governments in order to extinguish Indian land claims and admit the Indian and Oklahoma territories as a state in 1907.  From that period, the US appointed chiefs of the Choctaw and other tribes in the former Indian Territory.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Choctaw soldiers served in the U.S. military as the first Native American [[codetalkers]], using the [[Choctaw language]]. After the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, the Choctaw reconstituted their government. The Choctaw Nation had kept their culture alive despite years of pressure for [[Americanization (of Native Americans)|assimilation]].\n\nThe Choctaw are the third-largest federally recognized tribe. Since the mid-twentieth century, the Choctaw have created new institutions, such as a [[tribal college]], housing authority, and justice system. Today the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]], the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]], and the [[Jena Band of Choctaw Indians]] are the federally recognized Choctaw tribes. Mississippi also recognizes another band, and smaller Choctaw groups are located in Louisiana, Alabama, and Texas.  The Alabama Choctaw who are federally recognized under 24 C.F.R 1000 and 25 U.S.C. 4101 called the Native American Housing Self-Determination Act of 1986 (formerly the \"Indian\" Housing Act of 1937) under which the United States Federal Government jointly owns the MOWA Choctaw Indian Reservation as land held in trust as a reservation and for the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians per multiple deeds in public records in Mobile County, Alabama Department of Revenue Records. The Department of Interior has listed the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians as a trustee of Natural Resources in the Southeast Region of the United States.   The National Park Service under the Secretary of Interior has posted public notice of the MOWA Choctaw Indian Reservation in Alabama.  The Office of the Secretary of Interior issued the MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians its Federal Bureau of Investigations ORI number formally acknowledging the Government to Government relationship in 1999.\n\nThe MOWA Band of Choctaw Indians in Alabama and the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council, which is composed solely of non-federally recognized tribes under Chief Framon Weaver, obtained a US Supreme Court ruling that sovereign immunity applies not only to entities such as the Alabama Inter-Tribal Council as an arm of the tribe, but also that sovereign immunity is inherent and possessed of Indians because they are Indians. This decision of the U.S. Federal Court of Appeals was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in 2002.<ref>''[[Taylor v.

They kept slavery until 1866. After the Civil War, they were required by treaty with the United States to [[Emancipation|emancipate]] the slaves within their Nation and, for those who chose to stay, offer them full citizenship and rights.

It drew large-scale mining and timber operations, which added to tribal receipts. But, the railroads and industries also attracted European-American settlers, including new immigrants to the United States.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\">Kidwell (2007)</ref>\n\n[[Image:Portrait (Front) of Faunceway Baptiste or Battice (Mixed Blood) 1868.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Faunceway Baptiste, a Choctaw man in 1868, of mixed-race ancestry.

In addition, it proposed the end of communal, tribal lands. Continuing the struggle over land and assimilation, the US proposed the end to the tribal lands held in common, and allotment of lands to tribal members in [[severalty]] (individually). The US declared land in excess of the registered households needs to be \"surplus\" to the tribe, and took it for sale to new European-American settlers. In addition, individual ownership meant that Native Americans could sell their individual plots. This would also enable new settlers to buy land from those Native Americans who wished to sell. The US government set up the [[Dawes Commission]] to manage the land allotment policy; it registered members of the tribe and made allocations of lands.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/>\n\nBeginning in 1894, the Dawes Commission was established to register Choctaw and other families of the Indian Territory, so that the former tribal lands could be properly distributed among them. The final list included 18,981 citizens of the Choctaw Nation, 1,639 Mississippi Choctaw, and 5,994 former slaves (and descendants of former slaves), most held by Choctaws in the Indian/Oklahoma Territory. (At the same time, the Dawes Commission registered members of the other Five Civilized Tribes for the same purpose. The Dawes Rolls have become important records for proving tribal membership.) Following completion of the land allotments, the US proposed to end tribal governments of the Five Civilized Tribes and admit the two territories jointly as a state.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\" />\n\n====Territory transition to Oklahoma statehood (1889)====\n{{Further|Indian Territory|Oklahoma Territory}}\n\n[[Image:Choctaw Senate.jpg|right|275px|thumb|Choctaw Nation senate in 1898.

The government used its railroad access to the Oklahoma Territory to stimulate development there. The Indian Appropriations Bill of 1889 included an amendment by Illinois Representative [[William McKendree Springer]], that authorized President [[Benjamin Harrison]] to open the two million acres (8,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of Oklahoma Territory for settlement, resulting in the [[Land Run of 1889]]. The Choctaw Nation was overwhelmed with new settlers and could not regulate their activities. In the late 19th century, Choctaws suffered almost daily from violent crimes, murders, thefts and assaults from whites and from other Choctaws. Intense factionalism divided the traditionalistic \"Nationalists\" and pro-assimilation \"Progressives,\" who fought for control.<ref>Devon Abbott Mihesuah, ''Choctaw Crime and Punishment, 1884\u20131907'' (2009)</ref>\n\nIn 1905, delegates of the Five Civilized Tribes met at the [[Sequoyah Convention]] to write a constitution for an Indian-controlled state. They wanted to have Indian Territory admitted as the [[State of Sequoyah]]. Although they took a thoroughly developed proposal to Washington, DC, seeking approval, eastern states' representatives opposed it, not wanting to have two western states created in the area, as the Republicans feared that both would be Democrat-dominated, as the territories had a southern tradition of settlement. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a Republican, ruled that the Oklahoma and Indian territories had to be jointly admitted as one state, Oklahoma. To achieve this, tribal governments had to end and all residents accept state government. Many of the leading Native American representatives from the Sequoyah Convention participated in the new state convention. Its constitution was based on many elements of the one developed for the State of Sequoyah.<ref name=choctaw_ok_statehood />\n\nIn 1906 the U.S. dissolved the governments of the Five Civilized Tribes. This action was part of continuing negotiations by Native Americans and European Americans over the best proposals for the future. The Choctaw Nation continued to protect resources not stipulated in treaty or law.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/> On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was admitted to the union as the 46th state.\n\n===Mississippi Choctaw Delegation to Washington (1914)===\n\n[[Image:Wesley Johnson with Delegates.jpg|right|thumb|From left to right, Chief Wesley Johnson, T.

Although the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] stated Mississippi Choctaws had U.S. citizenship, they had become associated with \"colored people\" as non-white in a state that had imposed racial segregation under [[Jim Crow laws]]. State services for Native Americans were non-existent. The state was poor and still dependent on agriculture. In its system of segregation, services for minorities were consistently underfunded.

Jackson, Lonnie Anderson, Joseph Farve, Phillip Farve, Will Wilson, Hensley Gibson, Will Jimmie, Baxter York, Ennis Martin, and Jimpson McMillan.\n\nAfter World War II, pressure in Congress mounted to reduce Washington's authority on Native American lands and liquidate the government's responsibilities to them. In 1953 the House of Representatives passed Resolution 108, proposing an end to federal services for 13 tribes deemed ready to handle their own affairs. The same year, Public Law 280 transferred jurisdiction over tribal lands to state and local governments in five states. Within a decade Congress terminated federal services to more than sixty groups despite intense opposition by Indians. Congress settled on a policy to [[Indian termination policy|terminate]] tribes as quickly as possible. Out of concern for the isolation of many Native Americans in rural areas, the federal government created relocation programs to cities to try to expand their employment opportunities. Indian policy experts hoped to expedite assimilation of Native Americans to the larger American society, which was becoming urban.<ref name=\"Kidwell 2007\"/>  In 1959, the Choctaw Termination Act was passed.<ref name=indian_termination>{{Cite web\n |url          = http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/native_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=96\n |title        = U.S. House of Representatives Resolution 108, 83rd Congress, 1953.

Realizing the damage that had been done by termination of tribal status, he ended the federal emphasis of the 1950s on termination of certain tribes' federally recognized status and relationships with the federal government:\n\n{{quote|Forced termination is wrong, in my judgment, for a number of reasons.

The legislation authorized processes by which tribes could negotiate contracts with the BIA to manage directly more of their education and social service programs. In addition, it provided direct grants to help tribes develop plans for assuming such responsibility. It also provided for Indian parents' participation on local school boards.<ref name=\"William C.

They had many people available to work, natural resources, and no state or federal taxes. Industries have included automotive parts, greeting cards, direct mail and printing, and plastic-molding. The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians is one of the state's largest employers, running 19 businesses and employing 7,800 people.<ref name=\"mshistory.k12.ms.us\">[http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/10/choctaw-indians-in-the-21st-century Deborah Boykin, \"Choctaw Indians in the 21st Century\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210154522/http://mshistory.k12.ms.us/articles/10/choctaw-indians-in-the-21st-century |date=2009-02-10 }}, Mississippi History Now, accessed 25 March 2009</ref>\n\nStarting with New Hampshire in 1963, numerous state governments began to operate lotteries and other gambling in order to raise money for government services, often promoting the programs by promising to earmark revenues to fund education, for instance. In 1987 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled that [[federally recognized tribes]] could operate gaming facilities on reservations, as this was sovereign territory, and be  free from state regulation. As tribes began to develop gaming, starting with bingo, in 1988 the U.S. Congress enacted the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] (IGRA). It set the broad terms for Native American tribes to operate [[casino]]s, requiring that they do so only in states that had already authorized private gaming.<ref name=\"William C. Canby pp. 23-33\"/> Since then development of casino gaming has been one of the chief sources for many tribes of new revenues.\n\nThe [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]] developed gaming operations and a related resort: the [[Choctaw Casino Resort]] and [[Choctaw Casino Bingo]] are their popular gaming destinations in [[Durant, Oklahoma|Durant]]. Located near the Oklahoma-Texas border, these sites attract residents of Southern Oklahoma and North Texas. The largest regional population base from which they draw is the [[Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex]].\n\nThe Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (MBCI) unsuccessfully sought state agreement to develop gaming under the [[Ray Mabus]] administration. But in 1992 Mississippi Governor [[Kirk Fordice]] gave permission for the MBCI to develop Class III gaming. They have developed one of the largest casino resorts in the nation; it is located in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]] near the [[Pearl River (Mississippi\u2013Louisiana)|Pearl River]]. The Silver Star Casino opened its doors in 1994. The Golden Moon Casino opened in 2002. The casinos are collectively known as the [[Pearl River Resort]].\n\nAfter nearly two hundred years, the Choctaw have regained control of the ancient sacred site of [[Nanih Waiya]]. Mississippi protected the site for years as a state park. In 2006, the state legislature passed a bill to return ''Nanih Waiya'' to the Choctaw.\n\n===Jack Abramoff and Indian casino lobbying===\n\n{{Further|Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal}}\n[[Image:Abramoff SIAC 20040929 2.jpg|right|thumb|275px|Video capture from video of Senate Indian Affairs Committee Hearing on 'Lobbying Practices Involving Indian Tribes' on September 29, 2004 as found at indian.senate.gov]]\n\nIn the second half of the 1990s, lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]] was employed by Preston Gates Ellis & Rouvelas Meeds LLP, the lobbying arm in Washington, DC of the [[Preston Gates & Ellis]] LLP law firm based in [[Seattle, Washington]]. In 1995, Abramoff began representing Native American tribes who wanted to develop gambling casinos, starting with the [[Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians]].\n\nThe Choctaw originally had lobbied the federal government directly, but beginning in 1994, they found that many of the congressional members who had responded to their issues had either retired or were defeated in the \"[[Republican Revolution]]\" of the [[United States House elections, 1994|1994 elections]]. Nell Rogers, the tribe's specialist on legislative affairs, had a friend who was familiar with the work of Abramoff and his father as Republican activists. The tribe contacted Preston Gates, and soon after hired the firm and Abramoff.\n\nAbramoff succeeded in gaining defeat of a Congressional bill to use the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) to tax Native American casinos; it was sponsored by Reps. [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] (R-TX) and [[Ernest Istook]] (R-OK). Since the matter involved taxation, Abramoff enlisted help from [[Grover Norquist]], a Republican acquaintance from college, and his [[Americans for Tax Reform]] (ATR). The bill was eventually defeated in 1996 in the Senate, due in part to grassroots work by ATR. The Choctaw paid $60,000 in fees to Abramoff.\n\nAccording to ''Washington Business Forward'', a lobbying trade magazine, Senator [[Tom DeLay]] was also a major figure in achieving defeat of the bill. The fight strengthened Abramoff's alliance with him.<ref>[http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ www.bizforward.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206184358/http://www.bizforward.com/wdc/issues/2002-11/government/abramoff/ |date=December 6, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nPurporting to represent Native Americans before Congress and state governments in the developing field of gaming, [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal|Jack Abramoff]] and [[Michael Scanlon]] used fraudulent means to gain profits of $15 million in total payments from the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians.

The Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs voted 11\u20132 in support of federal recognition for the MOWA Choctaw.  To date the tribe has had 12 Congressional Bills, 3 appeals through the office of federal acknowledgement, and a federal lawsuit directed at its efforts for federal recognition.\n\nFederal recognition is not a pre-requisite to accord a tribe sovereign immunity, according to ''[[John. S. Bottomly v Passamaquoddy Tribe et al.]]'' 595 F.2d 1061 (1st Cir. 1979).  In Bottomly, the United States Supreme Court held that the availability of sovereign immunity is not conditioned on formal federal recognition of a particular tribe.  Therefore a tribe, its chief, nor its tribal officials do not need to prove that it has been federally recognized in order to assert immunity from suit for acts done in their official tribal capacity.\n\n*Mississippi, Live Oak Choctaw\n*Louisiana: \n-Bayou Lacombe Choctaw\n-Clifton Choctaw\n-Jena Band of Choctaw Indians\n-Choctaw-Apache of Ebarb\n\n===In the 2010 Census===\nIn the 2010 US Census, there were people who identified as Choctaw living in every state of the Union.<ref>2010 US Census table on reported tribes</ref>  The states with the largest Choctaw populations were:\n* Oklahoma \u2013 79,006\n* Texas \u2013 24,024\n* California \u2013 23,403\n* Mississippi \u2013 9,260\n* Arkansas \u2013 4,840\n* Alabama \u2013 4,513\n\n==Culture==\n{{Main|Culture of the Choctaw}}\n\n[[Image:Tullockchishko.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Tullockchishko'' (Drinks the Juice of the Stones) was the greatest of Choctaw stickball players, 1834.]]\n\nThe Choctaw people are believed to have coalesced in the 17th century, perhaps from peoples from Alabama and the Plaquemine culture.

Some of their communities had extensive trade and interaction with Europeans, including people from [[Spain]], [[France]], and [[England]] greatly shaped it as well.

The people had a [[matrilineal]] kinship system, with children born into the clan or iska of the mother and taking their social status from it. In this system, their maternal uncles had important roles. Identity was established first by moiety and iska; so a Choctaw identified first as Imoklasha or Inhulata, and second as Choctaw.

The Choctaw language is the essence of tribal culture, tradition, and identity.<ref name=living_tradition>\n{{Cite book\n | title     = A Living Tradition: An Overview of Choctaw Cultural Arts\n | publisher = Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians\n | page      = 5\n | year = 2006\n}}\n</ref> Many Choctaw adults learned to speak the language before speaking English.

They may have been sun, or ''Hushtahli'', worshippers. The historian John Swanton wrote,\n<blockquote>[T]he Choctaws anciently regarded the sun as a deity ... the sun was ascribed the power of life and death. He was represented as looking down upon the earth, and as long as he kept his flaming eye fixed on any one, the person was safe ... fire, as the most striking representation of the sun, was considered as possessing intelligence, and as acting in concert with the sun ... [having] constant intercourse with the sun ...<ref name=john_reed /></blockquote>\n\nThe word ''nanpisa'' (the one who sees) expressed the reverence the Choctaw had for the sun.<ref name=john_reed_religion>\n{{Cite book\n | last = Swanton | first = John R.\n | title     = Source Material for the Social and Ceremonial Life of the Choctaw Indians\n | publisher = The University of Alabama Press\n | pages     = 194\u2013196\n | isbn      = 0-8173-1109-2\n | year      = 2001\n | origyear  = 1931\n}}\n</ref>\n\n{{quote|Anthropologist theorize that the Mississippian ancestors of the Choctaw placed the sun at the center of their cosmological system. Mid-eighteenth-century Choctaws did view the sun as a being endowed with life. Choctaw diplomats, for example, spoke only on sunny days. If the day of a conference were cloudy or rainy, Choctaws delayed the meeting until the sun returned, usually on the pretext that they needed more time to discuss particulars. They believed the sun made sure that all talks were honest.

They are based on designs of their ancestors, who adapted 19th-century European-American styles to their needs. Today many Choctaw wear such traditional clothing mainly for special events.

Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]] led to the replacement of the term \"affinity\" by the term \"[[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]]\" in much of the English-speaking world.\n\nAccording to Prigogine,<ref>I.Prigogine. (1980). ''From being to becoming. Time and Complexity in the Physical Sciences''. San Francisco: W.H.Freeman and Co</ref> the term was introduced and developed by [[Th\u00e9ophile de Donder]].<ref>de Donder, T. (1936). ''L'affinit\u00e9''. Ed. Pierre Van Rysselberghe. Paris: Gauthier-Villars</ref>\n\n[[Goethe]] used the concept in his novel [[Elective Affinities]] (1809).\n\n===Visual representations ===\nThe affinity concept was very closely linked to the visual representation of substances on a table.  The first-ever ''affinity table'', which was based on [[displacement reaction]]s, was published in 1718 by the French chemist [[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois Geoffroy]].  Geoffroy's name is best known in connection with these tables of \"affinities\" (''tables des rapports''), which were first presented to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1718 and 1720, as shown below:\n\n<center>\n[[Image:Affinity-table.jpg|500px|center|thumb|Geoffroy's '''Affinity Table''' (1718): At the head of the column is a substance with which all the substances below can combine, where each column below the header is ranked by degrees of \"'''affinity'''\".]]\n</center>\n\nDuring the 18th century many versions of the table were proposed with leading chemists like Torbern Bergman in Sweden and Joseph Black in Scotland adapting it to accommodate new chemical discoveries.  All the tables were essentially lists, prepared by collating observations on the actions of substances one upon another, showing the varying degrees of affinity exhibited by analogous bodies for different [[reagent]]s.\n\nCrucially, the table was the central graphic tool used to teach chemistry to students and its visual arrangement was often combined with other kinds diagrams.  Joseph Black, for example, used the table in combination with chiastic and circlet diagrams to visualise the core principles of chemical affinity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=How to See a Diagram: A Visual Anthropology of Chemical Affinity|journal=Osiris|date=2014|pages=178\u2013196|doi=10.1086/678093|url=https://www.academia.edu/4588508/How_to_See_a_Diagram_A_Visual_Anthropology_of_Chemical_Affinity_Osiris_2014_178-196|volume=29}}</ref>  Affinity tables were used throughout Europe until the early 19th century when  they were displaced by affinity concepts introduced by [[Claude Louis Berthollet|Claude Berthollet]].\n\n==Modern conceptions==\nIn [[chemical physics]] and [[physical chemistry]], '''chemical affinity''' is the electronic property by which dissimilar [[chemical species]] are capable of forming [[chemical compounds]].<ref>{{harvnb|Chisholm|1911|loc=Affinity, Chemical}}</ref>  Chemical affinity can also refer to the tendency of an [[atom]] or compound to combine by [[chemical reaction]] with atoms or compounds of unlike composition.\n\nIn modern terms, we relate affinity to the phenomenon whereby certain atoms or molecules have the tendency to aggregate or bond.  For example, in the 1919 book ''Chemistry of Human Life'' physician George W. Carey states that, \"Health depends on a proper amount of iron phosphate Fe<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> in the blood, for the molecules of this salt have chemical affinity for oxygen and carry it to all parts of the organism.\" In this antiquated context, chemical affinity is sometimes found synonymous with the term \"magnetic attraction\".  Many writings, up until about 1925, also refer to a \"law of chemical affinity\".\n\n[[Ilya Prigogine]] summarized the concept of affinity, saying, \"All chemical reactions drive the system to a state of [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] in which the ''affinities'' of the reactions vanish.\"\n\n==Thermodynamics==\n\nThe present [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition is that affinity ''A'' is the negative [[partial derivative]] of [[Gibbs free energy]] ''G'' with respect to [[extent of reaction]] ''\u03be'' at constant [[pressure]] and [[temperature]].<ref>[http://www.IUPAC.org IUPAC Green Book and Gold Book in .pdf]</ref> That is,\n:<math>A = -\\left(\\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial \\xi}\\right)_{P,T}.</math>\n\nIt follows that affinity is positive for [[Spontaneous process|spontaneous reactions]].\n\nIn 1923, the Belgian mathematician and physicist [[Th\u00e9ophile de Donder]] derived a relation between affinity and the Gibbs free energy of a [[chemical reaction]].  Through a series of derivations, de Donder showed that if we consider a mixture of [[chemical species]] with the possibility of chemical reaction, it can be proven that the following relation holds:\n\n:<math> A = -\\Delta_rG. \\,</math>\n\nWith the writings of [[Th\u00e9ophile de Donder]] as precedent, [[Ilya Prigogine]] and Defay in ''Chemical Thermodynamics'' (1954) defined chemical affinity as the rate of change of the uncompensated [[heat]] of reaction ''Q''' as the [[Stoichiometry|reaction progress variable]] or reaction extent ''\u03be'' grows infinitesimally:\n\n:<math>A  = \\frac{{\\mathrm d}Q'}{{\\mathrm d}\\xi}. \\, </math>\n\nThis definition is useful for quantifying the factors responsible both for the state of equilibrium systems (where {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 0}}), and for changes of state of non-equilibrium systems (where ''A'' \u2260 0'').\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Chemistry]]\n*[[Chemical bond]]\n*[[Electronegativity]]\n*[[Electron affinity]]\n*[[\u00c9tienne Fran\u00e7ois Geoffroy]] \u2014 Geoffroy's 1718 Affinity Table\n*[[Valency (chemistry)|Valency]]\n*[[Affinity chromatography]]\n*[[Affinity electrophoresis]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n\n*{{EB1911|wstitle=Affinity, Chemical}}\n\n==External links==\n* [[William Whewell]].

Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with any degree of certainty is difficult, Hale\u2013Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed [[perihelion]] on April 1, 1997. It was visible to the naked eye for a record 18&nbsp;months, twice as long as the previous record holder, the [[Great Comet of 1811]]. Accordingly, Hale\u2013Bopp was dubbed the [[Great comet|Great Comet]] of 1997.\n\n== Discovery ==\nThe comet was discovered independently on July 23, 1995, by two observers, [[Alan Hale (astronomer)|Alan Hale]] and [[Thomas Bopp]], both in the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = The comets of 1995 | last = Shanklin |first = Jonathan D. | journal = Journal of the British Astronomical Association | year= 2000 | volume =110 |issue = 6 |page= 311 |bibcode = 2000JBAA..110..311S}}</ref>\n\nHale had spent many hundreds of hours searching for comets without success, and was tracking known comets from his driveway in [[New Mexico]] when he chanced upon Hale\u2013Bopp just after midnight. The comet had an [[apparent magnitude]] of 10.5 and lay near the [[globular cluster M70]] in the constellation of [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Sagittarius]].<ref name=\"Circ6187\" /> Hale first established that there was no other [[deep-sky object]] near M70, and then consulted a directory of known comets, finding that none were known to be in this area of the sky.

Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail.

It adjoins the [[Thar Desert]], extending over to [[Sindh]] and into [[India]].\n\nThe word Cholistan is derived from the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''chol'',  meaning ''desert''. The people of Cholistan lead a semi-nomadic life, moving from one place to another in search of water and fodder for their animals. The dry bed of the [[Hakra River]] runs through the area, along which many settlements of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] have been found.\n\nThe desert also hosts an annual Jeep rally, known as [[Cholistan Desert Jeep Rally]]. It is the biggest motor sports event in Pakistan.\n\n==Culture and traditions==\n\n===Arts and crafts===\nIn a harsh and barren land where rainfall is very sparse and unreliable, Cholistanis rely mainly on their livestock of sheep, goats, and camel. However, in cold nights of winter they huddle indoor and engage themselves in various arts and crafts such as textiles, weaving, leatherwork, and pottery.\n\n===Local crafts===\nAs mentioned above, the Indus Valley has always been occupied by the wandering [[Nomad|nomadic]] tribes, who are fond of isolated areas, as such areas allow them to lead life free of foreign intrusion, enabling them to establish their own individual and unique cultures. Cholistan till the era of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]] had also been isolated from outside influence. During the rule of [[Jalal-ud-Din Muhammad Akbar|Mughal Emperor Akbar]], it became a proper productive unit. The entire area was ruled by a host of kings who securely guarded their frontiers. The rulers were the great patrons of art, and the various crafts underwent a simultaneous and parallel development, influencing each other. Masons, stone carvers, artisans, artists, and designers started rebuilding the old cities and new sites, and with that flourished new courts, paintings, weaving, and pottery. The fields of architecture, sculpture, terra cotta, and pottery developed greatly in this phase.\n\n===Livestock===\nThe backbone of Cholistan economy is cattle breeding. It has the major importance for satisfying the area's major needs for cottage industry as well as milk meat and fat. Because of the nomadic way of life the main wealth of the people are their cattle that are bred for sale, milked or shorn for their wool. Moreover, isolated as they were, they had to depend upon themselves for all their needs like food, clothing, and all the items of daily use. So all their crafts initially stemmed from necessity but later on they started exporting their goods to the other places as well. The estimated number of livestock in the desert areas is 1.6 million.\n\n===Cotton and wool products===\nCholistan produces very superior type of carpet wool as compared to that produced in other parts of Pakistan. From this wool they knit beautiful carpets, rugs and other woolen items. This includes blankets, which is also a local necessity for the desert is not just a land of dust and heat, but winter nights here are very cold, usually below freezing points. Khes and pattu are also manufactured with wool or cotton. Khes is a form of blanket with a field of black white and pattu has a white ground base. Cholistanis now sell the wool for it brings maximum profit.\n\n===Textiles===\nIt may be mentioned that cotton textiles have always been a hallmark of craft of Indus valley civilization. Various kinds of khaddar-cloth are made for local consumption, and fine khaddar bedclothes and coarse lungies are woven here. A beautiful cloth called Sufi is also woven of silk and cotton, or with cotton wrap and silk wool. Gargas are made with numerous patterns and color, having complicated embroidery, mirror, and patchwork. Ajrak is another specialty of Cholistan. It is a special and delicate printing technique on both sides of the cloth in indigo blue and red patterns covering the base cloth. Cotton turbans and shawls are also made here. Chunri is another form of dopattas, having innumerable colors and patterns like dots, squares, and circles on it.\n\n===Camel products===\nCamels are highly valued by the desert dwellers. Camels are not only useful for transportation and loading purposes, but its skin and wool are also quite worthwhile. Camel wool is spun and woven into beautiful woolen blankets known as falsies and into stylish and durable rugs. The camel's leather is also utilized in making kuppies, goblets, and expensive lampshades.\n\n===Leatherwork===\nLeatherwork is another important local cottage industry due to the large number of livestock here. Other than the products mentioned above, Khusa (shoes) is a specialty of this area. Cholistani khusas are very famous for the quality of workmanship, variety, and richness of designs especially when stitched and embroidered with golden or brightly colored threads.\n\n===Jewellery ===\nThe Cholistanis are fond of jewellery, especially gold jewellery. The chief ornaments made and worn by them are ''Nath'' (nose gay), ''Katmala'' (necklace) ''Kangan'' (bracelet), and ''Pazeb'' (anklets). Gold and silver bangles are also a product of Cholistan. The locals similarly work in enamel, producing enamel buttons, earrings, bangles, and rings.\n\n===Love for colors===\nThe great desert though considered to be colorless and drab, is not wholly devoid of color. Its green portion plays the role of \"color belt\" especially after rains when vegetation growth is at its peak. Adding to that the locals always wear brightly colored clothes mostly consisting of brilliant reds, blazing oranges shocking pinks, and startling yellows and greens. Even the cloth trappings of their bullocks and camels are richly colored and highly textured.\n\n==Forests in Cholistan==\nThere is a rain forest in Cholistan named \"Dodhla Forest\"\n\n==Wildlife==\nThe wildlife of Cholistan desert mostly consists of migratory birds, especially [[Houbara bustard]] who migrates to this part during winters. This species of birds is most famous in the hunting season, even though they are [[endangered]] in [[Pakistan]] ([[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] globally), according to [[IUCN Red List]]. Their population has decreased from 4,746 in 2001 to just a few dozens in recent times.<ref name=\"tribune.com.pk\">{{cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/121981/cholistan-wildlife-gazelles-migratory-birds-threatened-by-poachers/|title=Cholistan wildlife: Gazelles, migratory birds threatened by poachers - The Express Tribune|author=|date=22 February 2011|website=tribune.com.pk|accessdate=13 April 2018}}</ref> \nIn December 2016, a Qatari prince, had his hunting license rejected due to the species being endangered.

Local soil is very fine, thus most suitable for making pottery. The fineness of the earth can be observed on the Kacha houses which are actually plastered with mud but look like white cemented. The chief Cholistani ceramic articles are their surahies, piyalas, and glasses, remarkable for their lightness and fine finishing.\n\nIn the early times only the art of pottery and terracotta developed, but from the seventh century onwards, a large number of temples and images were also built on account of the intensified religious passions and the accumulation of wealth in cities. The building activity reached to such an extent that some cities actually became city temples. In fact the area particularly came to be known for its forts, villas, palaces, havelis, gateways, fortifications, and city walls.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n*Mughal, M.R. 1997.

It is likely that {{lang|gd|Causant\u00edn}}'s (Constantine I) reign witnessed increased activity by [[Vikings]], based in [[Ireland]], [[Northumbria]] and northern [[Great Britain|Britain]]. He died fighting one such invasion.\n\n==Sources==\nVery few records of ninth century events in northern Britain survive. The main local source from the period is the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'', a list of kings from Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn (died 858) to [[Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Coluim]] (died 995). The list survives in the [[Poppleton Manuscript]], a thirteenth-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added from the tenth century onwards.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 87\u201393; Dumville, \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\".</ref> In addition to this, later king lists survive.<ref>Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', reproduces these lists and discusses their origins, further discussed by Broun, ''Irish origins''.</ref> The earliest [[genealogical]] records of the descendants of Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn may date from the end of the tenth century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.<ref>Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 133\u2013164; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220\u2013221.</ref> The Pictish king-lists originally ended with this Causant\u00edn, who was reckoned the seventieth and last king of the Picts.<ref>Broun, ''Irish Identity'', p. 168\u2013169; Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', p. 78</ref>\n\nFor narrative history the principal sources are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and the Irish annals. While [[Scandinavia]]n [[sagas]] describe events in 9th century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 277\u2013285; \u00d3 Corrain, \"Vikings in Scotland and Ireland\"...</ref> If the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] and the former Pictland, are limited and late, those for the areas on the [[Irish Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coasts\u2014the modern regions of north-west England and all of northern and western Scotland\u2014are non-existent, and [[archaeology]] and [[toponymy]] are of primary importance.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Languages and names==\nWriting a century before Causant\u00edn was born, [[Bede]] recorded five languages in Britain. [[Latin]], the common language of the church; [[Old English language|Old English]], the language of the Angles and Saxons; [[Irish language|Irish]], spoken on the western coasts of Britain and in Ireland; [[British language (Celtic)|Brythonic]], ancestor of the [[Welsh language]], spoken in large parts of western Britain; and [[Pictish language|Pictish]], spoken in northern Britain. By the ninth century a sixth language, [[Old Norse]], had arrived with the Vikings.\n\n==Amla\u00edb and \u00cdmar==\nViking activity in northern Britain appears to have reached a peak during Causant\u00edn's reign. Viking armies were led by a small group of men who may have been kinsmen. Among those noted by the Irish annals, the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' and the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' are [[\u00cdmar|\u00cdvarr]]\u2014\u00cdmar in Irish sources\u2014who was active from [[Kingdom of East Anglia|East Anglia]] to Ireland, Halfd\u00e1n\u2014Albdann in Irish, Healfdene in Old English\u2014 and [[Amla\u00edb Conung|Amla\u00edb]] or \u00d3l\u00e1fr. As well as these leaders, various others related to them appear in the surviving record.<ref>Downham, Smyth, Woolf.</ref>\n\nViking activity in Britain increased in 865 when the [[Great Heathen Army]], probably a part of the forces which had been active in [[Francia]], landed in East Anglia.<ref>Check Nelson.</ref> The following year, having obtained tribute from the East Anglian King [[Edmund the Martyr|Edmund]], the Great Army moved north, seizing [[York]], chief city of the Northumbrians.<ref>Downham, Keynes, Woolf.</ref> The Great Army defeated an attack on York by the two rivals for the Northumbrian throne, [[Osberht of Northumbria|Osberht]] and [[\u00c6lla of Northumbria|\u00c6lla]], who had put aside their differences in the face of a common enemy. Both would-be kings were killed in the failed assault, probably on 21 March 867. Following this, the leaders of the Great Army are said to have installed one [[Ecgberht I of Northumbria|Ecgberht]] as king of the Northumbrians.<ref>Downham, Higham, Keynes, O Corrain, Smyth, Woolf.</ref> Their next target was [[Mercia]] where King [[Burgred of Mercia|Burgred]], aided by his brother-in-law King [[\u00c6thelred of Wessex]], drove them off.<ref>Keynes ...</ref>\n\nWhile the kingdoms of East Anglia, Mercia and Northumbria were under attack, other Viking armies were active in the far north. Amla\u00edb and [[Auisle]] (\u00c1sl or Au\u00f0g\u00edsl), said to be his brother, brought an army to Fortriu and obtained tribute and hostages in 866. Historians disagree as to whether the army returned to Ireland in 866, 867 or even in 869.<ref>Downham, O Corrain, Smyth, Woolf, AU 866.1.</ref> Late sources of uncertain reliability state that Auisle was killed by Amla\u00edb in 867 in a dispute over Amla\u00edb's wife, the daughter of Cin\u00e1ed. It is unclear whether, if accurate, this woman should be identified as a daughter of Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn, and thus Causant\u00edn's sister, or as a daughter of [[Cin\u00e1ed mac Conaing]], [[king of Brega]].<ref>Downham, ??, FAA.</ref> While Amla\u00edb and Auisle were in north Britain, the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' record that [[\u00c1ed Findliath]], [[High King of Ireland]], took advantage of their absence to destroy the [[longphort]]s along the northern coasts of Ireland.<ref>Byrne? O Corrain? AU 866.4</ref> \u00c1ed Findliath was married to Causant\u00edn's sister M\u00e1el Muire. She later married \u00c1ed's successor [[Flann Sinna]]. Her death is recorded in 913.<ref>Woolf, AU 913.1, Byrne p. 857, poss. same as Amla\u00edb's wife.</ref>\n\nIn 870, Amla\u00edb and \u00cdvarr attacked [[Dumbarton Rock]], where the [[River Leven, Dunbartonshire|River Leven]] meets the [[River Clyde]], the chief place of the kingdom of [[Alt Clut]], south-western neighbour of Pictland. The siege lasted four months before the fortress fell to the Vikings who returned to Ireland with many prisoners, \"Angles, Britons and Picts\", in 871. Archaeological evidence suggests that Dumbarton Rock was largely abandoned and that [[Govan]] replaced it as the chief place of the kingdom of Strathclyde, as Alt Clut was later known.<ref>AU 870.6, AU 871.2, Woolf, Downham, Smyth.</ref> King [[Artgal of Alt Clut]] did not long survive these events, being killed \"at the instigation\" of Causant\u00edn son of Cin\u00e1ed two years later. Artgal's son and successor [[Run of Alt Clut|Run]] was married to a sister of Causant\u00edn.<ref>AU 872.5, Smyth, Woolf.</ref>\n\nAmla\u00edb disappears from Irish annals after his return to Ireland in 871. According to the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' he was killed by Causant\u00edn either in 871 or 872 when he returned to Pictland to collect further tribute.<ref>Woolf, Downham.</ref> His ally \u00cdvarr died in 873.<ref>Woolf, Downham, AU 873.3</ref>\n\n==Last days of the Pictish kingdom==\nIn 875, the ''Chronicle'' and the ''Annals of Ulster'' again report a Viking army in Pictland. A battle, fought near [[Dollar, Clackmannanshire|Dollar]], was a heavy defeat for the Picts; the ''Annals of Ulster'' say that \"a great slaughter of the Picts resulted\". In 877, shortly after building a new church for the [[Culdees]] at St Andrews, Causant\u00edn was captured and executed (or perhaps killed in battle) after defending against Viking raiders.<ref>Raymond Lamont-Brown, ''St Andrews: City by the Northern Sea'' (Edinburgh: Berlinn, 2006), 9.</ref> Although there is agreement on the time and general manner of his death, it is not clear where this happened. Some believe he was beheaded on a Fife beach, following a battle at [[Fife Ness]], near Crail. [[William Forbes Skene]] reads the ''Chronicle'' as placing Causant\u00edn's death at Inverdovat (by [[Newport-on-Tay]]), which appears to match the [[Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]]. The account in the ''[[Chronicle of Melrose]]'' names the place as the \"Black Cave,\" and [[John of Fordun]] calls it the \"Black Den\". Causant\u00edn was buried on [[Iona]].\n\n==Aftermath==\nCausant\u00edn's son [[Donald II of Scotland|Domnall]] and his descendants represented the main line of the [[kings of Alba]] and later [[Scotland]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin}}\n*{{citation |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100001A/index.html |title=The Annals of Ulster, AD 431\u20131201 |accessdate=2007-10-02 |year=2003 |work= |publisher=CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts }}\n*{{citation |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100016/ |title=Chronicon Scotorum |accessdate=2007-10-29 |year=2003 |publisher=CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts }}\n*{{citation |url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100028/ |title=Lebor Bretnach (The Irish version of the Historia Britonum of Nennius) |accessdate=2008-10-04 |year=2002 |publisher=CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts }}\n*{{citation |last=Anderson |first=Alan Orr |authorlink=Alan Orr Anderson |title=Early Sources of Scottish History A.D. 500 to 1286 |volume=I |year=1990 |edition=2nd |publisher=Paul Watkins |location=Stamford |isbn=1-871615-03-8}}\n*{{citation |last=Anderson |first=Alan Orr |title=Scottish Annals from English Chroniclers A.D. 500 to 1286 |year=1908 |publisher=D.

The [[Kingdom of Alba]], a name which first appears in Constantine's lifetime, was situated in modern-day Scotland. The core of the kingdom was formed by the lands around the [[River Tay]]. Its southern limit was the [[River Forth]], northwards it extended towards the [[Moray Firth]] and perhaps to [[Caithness]], while its western limits are uncertain. Constantine's grandfather [[Kenneth I of Scotland]] (Cin\u00e1ed mac Ailp\u00edn, died 858) was the first of the family recorded as a king, but as [[king of the Picts]]. This change of title, from king of the Picts to king of Alba, is part of a broader transformation of [[Pictland]] and the [[origins of the Kingdom of Alba]] are traced to Constantine's lifetime.\n\nHis reign, like those of his predecessors, was dominated by the actions of [[Viking]] rulers in the [[British Isles]], particularly the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] (\"the grandsons of \u00cdmar\", or [[Ivar the Boneless]]). During Constantine's reign the rulers of the southern kingdoms of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]], later the [[Kingdom of England]], extended their authority northwards into the disputed kingdoms of [[Northumbria]]. At first allied with the southern rulers against the Vikings, Constantine in time came into conflict with them. King [[Athelstan of England|\u00c6thelstan]] was successful in securing Constantine's submission in 927 and 934, but the two again fought when Constantine, allied with the [[Strathclyde Britons]] and the Viking king of [[Dublin]], invaded \u00c6thelstan's kingdom in 937, only to be defeated at the great [[battle of Brunanburh]]. In 943 Constantine abdicated the throne and retired to the [[C\u00e9li D\u00e9]] (Culdee) [[Church of St Mary on the Rock|monastery of St Andrews]] where he died in 952. He was succeeded by his predecessor's son [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm&nbsp;I]] (M\u00e1el Coluim mac Domnaill).\n\nConstantine's reign of 43 years, exceeded in Scotland only by that of King [[William I of Scotland|William the Lion]] before the [[Union of the Crowns]] in 1603, is believed to have played a defining part in the [[gaelicisation]] of Pictland, in which his patronage of the Irish C\u00e9li D\u00e9 monastic reformers was a significant factor. During his reign the words \"Scots\" and \"Scotland\" ({{lang-ang|Scottas, Scotland}}) are first used to mean part of what is now [[Scotland]]. The earliest evidence for the ecclesiastical and administrative institutions which would last until the [[Davidian Revolution]] also appears at this time.\n\n==Sources==\nCompared to neighbouring Ireland and [[Anglo-Saxon England]], few records of 9th- and 10th-century events in Scotland survive. The main local source from the period is the ''[[Chronicle of the Kings of Alba]]'', a list of kings from Kenneth MacAlpin (died 858) to [[Kenneth II of Scotland|Kenneth&nbsp;II]] (Cin\u00e1ed mac Ma\u00edl Coluim, died 995). The list survives in the [[Poppleton Manuscript]], a 13th-century compilation. Originally simply a list of kings with reign lengths, the other details contained in the Poppleton Manuscript version were added in the 10th and 12th centuries.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 87\u201393; Dumville, \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\".</ref> In addition to this, later king lists survive.<ref>Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', reproduces these lists and discusses their origins.</ref> The earliest [[genealogical]] records of the descendants of Kenneth MacAlpin may date from the end of the 10th century, but their value lies more in their context, and the information they provide about the interests of those for whom they were compiled, than in the unreliable claims they contain.<ref>Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 133\u2013164; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220\u2013221.</ref>\n\nFor narrative history the principal sources are the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' and the [[Irish annals]]. The evidence from [[charter]]s created in the [[Kingdom of England]] provides occasional insight into events in northern Britain.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 2\u20133, 87\u201388, and 357\u2013359.</ref> While [[Scandinavia]]n [[sagas]] describe events in 10th-century Britain, their value as sources of historical narrative, rather than documents of social history, is disputed.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 277\u2013285; \u00d3 Corrain, \"Vikings in Scotland and Ireland\"; Sawyer and Sawyer, ''Medieval Scandinavia'', pp. 21\u201326.</ref> Mainland European sources rarely concern themselves with affairs in Britain, and even less commonly with events in northern Britain, but the life of Saint [[Cathr\u00f3e of Metz]], a work of [[hagiography]] written in Germany at the end of the 10th century, provides plausible details of the saint's early life in north Britain.<ref>MacQuarrie, ''Saints of Scotland'', pp. 199\u2013210.</ref>\n\nWhile the sources for north-eastern Britain, the lands of the kingdom of [[Northumbria]] and the former Pictland, are limited and late, those for the areas on the [[Irish Sea]] and Atlantic coasts\u2014the modern regions of north-west England and all of northern and western Scotland\u2014are non-existent, and [[archaeology]] and [[toponymy]] are of primary importance.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Pictland from Constant\u00edn mac Fergusa to Constantine I==\n{{main|Origins of the Kingdom of Alba}}\n[[Image:Early Alpinid kings.svg|280px|thumb|Recorded relationships within the early [[House of Alpin]]]]\n\nThe dominant kingdom in eastern Scotland before the [[Viking Age]] was the northern [[Pictish]] kingdom of [[Fortriu]] on the shores of the [[Moray Firth]]. By the 9th century, the [[Gaels]] of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] (Dalriada) were subject to the kings of Fortriu of the family of [[Constant\u00edn of the Picts|Constant\u00edn mac Fergusa]] (Constantine son of Fergus). Constant\u00edn's family dominated Fortriu after 789 and perhaps, if Constant\u00edn was a kinsman of [[\u00d3engus I of the Picts]] (\u00d3engus son of Fergus), from around 730. The dominance of Fortriu came to an end in 839 with a defeat by Viking armies reported by the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' in which King [[Uen of the Picts|Uen]] of Fortriu and his brother Bran, Constant\u00edn's nephews, together with the king of D\u00e1l Riata, [[\u00c1ed mac Boanta]], \"and others almost innumerable\" were killed.<ref>''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 838.</ref> These deaths led to a period of instability lasting a decade as several families attempted to establish their dominance in Pictland. By around 848 [[Kenneth I of Scotland|Kenneth MacAlpin]] had emerged as the winner.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 57\u201367 and 93\u201398; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 180\u2013185; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 8\u201310; Bannerman, \"Scottish takeover\"; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 107\u2013108.</ref>\n\nLater [[national myth]] made Kenneth MacAlpin the creator of the [[kingdom of Scotland]], the founding of which was dated from 843, the year in which he was said to have destroyed the Picts and inaugurated a new era. The historical record for 9th-century Scotland is meagre, but the Irish annals and the 10th-century ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' agree that Kenneth was a Pictish king, and call him \"king of the Picts\" at his death. The same style is used of Kenneth's brother [[Donald I of Scotland|Donald&nbsp;I]] (Domnall mac Ailp\u00edn) and sons [[Constantine I of Scotland|Constantine&nbsp;I]] (Constant\u00edn mac Cin\u00e1eda) and [[\u00c1ed of Scotland|\u00c1ed]] (\u00c1ed mac Cin\u00e1eda).<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 93\u2013117 and 320\u2013322; Broun, \"Dunkeld\"; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 13\u201314; Herbert, \"''Ri \u00c9irenn, Ri Alban''\"; Dumville, \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\", p. 76.</ref>\n\nThe kingdom ruled by Kenneth's descendants\u2014older works used the name [[House of Alpin]] to describe them but descent from Kenneth was the defining factor, Irish sources referring to ''Clann Cin\u00e1eda meic Ailp\u00edn'' (\"the Clan of Kenneth MacAlpin\")<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 220\u2013221 and 256\u2013257; Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 173\u2013174</ref>\u2014lay to the south of the previously dominant kingdom of Fortriu, centred in the lands around the [[River Tay]]. The extent of Kenneth's nameless kingdom is uncertain, but it certainly extended from the [[Firth of Forth]] in the south to the [[Mounth]] in the north. Whether it extended beyond the mountainous spine of north Britain\u2014[[Druim Alban]]\u2014is unclear. The core of the kingdom was similar to the old counties of [[Kincardineshire|Mearns]], [[Forfarshire|Forfar]], [[Perthshire|Perth]], Fife, and [[Kinross-shire|Kinross]]. Among the chief ecclesiastical centres named in the records are [[Dunkeld]], probably seat of the bishop of the kingdom, and ''Cell R\u00edgmonaid'' (modern [[St Andrews]]).<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 98\u2013101; Driscoll, ''Alba'' pp. 33\u201351; Foster, ''Picts, Gaels and Scots'', pp. 8 fig. 1, 39 fig. 24., and 110\u2013111.</ref>\n\nKenneth's son Constantine died in 876, probably killed fighting against a Viking army which had come north from Northumbria in 874. According to the king lists, he was counted the 70th and last king of the Picts in later times.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 106\u2013116; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 72\u201375, s.a. 875. For Constantine as the last Pictish king, the original count being 66 kings, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 124\u2013126; Broun, ''Irish Identity'', pp. 168\u2013169; Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 78\u201379.</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Britain and Ireland at the end of the ninth century}}\n\n==Britain and Ireland at the end of the 9th century==\n[[Image:Locations in north Britain in the early tenth century.png|thumb|Some locations in northern Britain, late 9th and early 10th centuries.

The situation in the Danish kingdoms of eastern Britain is less clear. King [[Eohric of East Anglia|Eohric]] was probably ruling in [[East Anglia]], but no dates can reliably be assigned to the successors of [[Guthfrith, King of York|Guthfrith of York]] in Northumbria. It is known that Guthfrith was succeeded by Sigurd and Cnut, although whether these men ruled jointly or one after the other is uncertain. Northumbria may have been divided by this time between the Viking kings in York and the local rulers, perhaps represented by [[Eadulf I of Bernicia|Eadulf]], based at [[Bamburgh]] who controlled the lands from the [[River Tyne]] or [[River Tees]] to the Forth in the north.<ref>Keynes, \"Rulers of the English\", pp. 504\u2013505; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138\u2013139; Blair, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 75\u201379.</ref>\n\nIn Ireland, [[Flann Sinna]], married to Constantine's aunt M\u00e1el Muire, was dominant. The years around 900 represented a period of weakness among the Vikings and [[Norse-Gaels]] of [[Dublin]]. They are reported to have been divided between two rival leaders. In 894 one group left Dublin, perhaps settling on the Irish Sea coast of Britain between the [[River Mersey]] and the [[Firth of Clyde]]. The remaining Dubliners were expelled in 902 by Flann Sinna's son-in-law [[Cerball mac Muirec\u00e1in]], and soon afterwards appeared in western and northern Britain.<ref>Annals of Ulster, s.a. 893 and 902; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 131 and 138\u2013139.</ref>\n\nTo the south-west of Constantine's lands lay the [[kingdom of Strathclyde]]. This extended north into the [[Lennox (district)|Lennox]], east to the River Forth, and south into the [[Southern Uplands]]. In 900 it was probably ruled by King [[Dyfnwal I of Strathclyde|Dyfnwal]].<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 153\u2013157.</ref>\n\nThe situation of the Gaelic kingdoms of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in western Scotland is uncertain. No kings are known by name after \u00c1ed mac Boanta. The [[Francia|Frankish]] ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' may record the conquest of the [[Inner Hebrides]], the seaward part of D\u00e1l Riata, by Northmen in 849.<ref>Woolf, pp. 99\u2013100 and 286\u2013289; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 277.</ref> In addition to these, the arrival of new groups of Vikings from northern and western Europe was still commonplace. Whether there were Viking or Norse-Gael kingdoms in the [[Western Isles]] or the [[Northern Isles]] at this time is debated.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 275\u2013311, especially 286\u2013289; \u00d3 Corrain, \"Vikings in Scotland and Ireland\"; Crawford, ''Scandinavian Scotland'', pp. 39\u201362; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 141\u2013174.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n[[\u00c1ed of Scotland|\u00c1ed]], Constantine's father, succeeded Constantine's uncle and namesake [[Constantine I of Scotland|Constantine&nbsp;I]] in 876 but was killed in 878. \u00c1ed's short reign is glossed as being of no importance by most king lists. Although the date of his birth is nowhere recorded, Constantine&nbsp;II cannot have been born any later than the year after his father's death, that is 879. His name may suggest that he was born rather earlier, during the reign of his uncle Constantine&nbsp;I.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 116\u2013117, 124, and 166, note 84.</ref>\n\nAfter \u00c1ed's death, there is a two-decade gap until the death of [[Donald II of Scotland|Donald&nbsp;II]] (Domnall mac Constant\u00edn) in 900 during which nothing is reported in the Irish annals.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 357\u2013358 and 395; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117\u2013118.</ref> The entry for the reign between \u00c1ed and Donald&nbsp;II is corrupt in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', and in this case the ''Chronicle'' is at variance with every other king list.<ref>On this, note Dumville's comments regarding [[damnatio memoriae]], Dumville, \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\", p. 75; see also Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117\u2013121.</ref> According to the ''Chronicle'', \u00c1ed was followed by [[Eochaid of Scotland|Eochaid]], a grandson of Kenneth MacAlpin, who is somehow connected with [[Giric of Scotland|Giric]], but all other lists say that Giric ruled after \u00c1ed and make great claims for him.<ref>Anderson, ''Kings and Kingship'', pp. 251\u2013252, 254, 263, 267, 274, 283, and 288.</ref> Giric is not known to have been a kinsman of Kenneth's, although it has been suggested that he was related to him by marriage. The major changes in Pictland which began at about this time have been associated by [[Alex Woolf]] and [[Archie Duncan (historian)|Archie Duncan]] with Giric's reign.<ref>Duncan, pp. 11\u201316; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 117\u2013121, 137\u2013138, and 320\u2013322. For an alternative view of all this, see Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 215\u2013218.</ref>\n\nWoolf suggests that Constantine and his cousin Donald may have passed Giric's reign in exile in Ireland where their aunt M\u00e1el Muire was wife of two successive [[High Kings of Ireland]], [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] and [[Flann Sinna]].<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 122\u2013125.</ref> Giric died in 889. If he had been in exile, Constantine may have returned to Pictland where his cousin Donald&nbsp;II became king. Donald's reputation is suggested by the [[epithet]] ''dasachtach'', a word used of violent madmen and mad bulls, attached to him in the 11th-century writings of [[Flann Mainistrech]], echoed by the his description in the ''[[Prophecy of Berchan]]'' as \"the rough one who will think relics and psalms of little worth\".<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. cxlix and 397\u2013398.</ref> Wars with the Viking kings in Britain and Ireland continued during Donald's reign and he was probably killed fighting yet more Vikings at [[Dunnottar]] in the Mearns in 900. Constantine succeeded him as king.<ref>Woolf, p. 125; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 395\u2013398. The account of the conquest of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] in Domnall's time given by, for example, Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 217\u2013218, is rejected by Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', p. 40, and Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 152\u2013157.</ref>\n\n==Vikings and bishops==\n[[Image:Monymusk Reliquary.jpg|thumb|The cult of Saint [[Columba]] and its relics were associated with victory in battle. The ''Cathbuaid'', Columba's [[crozier]] or staff, has been lost but the 8th-century ''Breccbennach'' or [[Monymusk Reliquary]] shown here, which held relics of Columba, is known to have been carried into battle from the reign of King [[William I of Scotland|William&nbsp;I]] onwards.<ref>Yorke, ''The Conversion of Britain'', pp. 190\u2013191; Alcock, ''Kings and Warriors'', pp. 327\u2013329; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p.136. See also the [[Cathach of St. Columba]], a 7th-century [[psalter]] to which similar powers were attributed.</ref>]]\n\nThe earliest event recorded in the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' in Constantine's reign is an attack by Vikings and the plundering of Dunkeld \"and all Albania\" in his third year. This is the first use of the word Albania, the [[Latin]] form of the [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''Alba'', in the ''Chronicle'' which until then describes the lands ruled by the descendants of Cin\u00e1ed as Pictavia.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 122\u2013126; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 444\u2013446, where Albania is translated as Scotland; Broun, \"Dunkeld\".</ref>\n\nThese Northmen may have been some of those who were driven out of [[Dublin]] in 902, but could also have been the same group who had defeated Domnall in 900. The ''Chronicle'' states that the Northmen were killed in ''Srath Erenn'', which is confirmed by the ''Annals of Ulster'' which records the death of [[\u00cdmar ua \u00cdmair|\u00cdmar grandson of \u00cdmar]] and many others at the hands of the men of Fortriu in 904. This \u00cdmar was the first of the [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]], that is the grandsons of \u00cdmar, to be reported; three more grandsons of \u00cdmar appear later in Constant\u00edn's reign. The ''[[Fragmentary Annals of Ireland]]'' contain an account of the battle, and this attributes the defeat of the Norsemen to the intercession of Saint [[Columba]] following fasting and prayer. An entry in the ''[[Chronicon Scotorum]]'' under the year 904 may possibly contain a corrupted reference to this battle.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 127\u2013128 and 130\u2013131; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 398, 399, and 444\u2013446; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 902, 904; ''Chronicon Scotorum'', s.a. 902, 904; ''Fragmentary Annals'', FA 429.</ref>\n\nThe next event reported by the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' is dated to 906. This records that:<blockquote>King Constantine and Bishop [[Cellach I of Cennr\u00edgmonaid|Cellach]] met at the ''Hill of Belief'' near the royal city of [[Scone, Perth and Kinross|Scone]] and pledged themselves that the laws and disciplines of the faith, and the laws of churches and gospels, should be kept ''pariter cum Scottis''.<ref>After Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 445.</ref></blockquote> The meaning of this entry, and its significance, have been the subject of debate.\n\n[[Image:Moot hill.jpg|thumb|left|The [[moot hill]] at Scone, perhaps the ''Hill of Belief'' of 906<ref>Bannerman, \"Scottish Takeover\", p. 79.</ref>]]\n\nThe phrase ''pariter cum Scottis'' in the [[Latin]] text of the ''Chronicle'' has been translated in several ways. [[William Forbes Skene]] and [[Alan Orr Anderson]] proposed that it should be read as \"in conformity with the customs of the Gaels\", relating it to the claims in the king lists that Giric liberated the church from secular oppression and adopted Irish customs.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 445, note 1; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 135. This version is followed by Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 188\u2013189.</ref> It has been read as \"together with the Gaels\", suggesting either public participation or the presence of Gaels from the western coasts as well as the people of the east coast.<ref>Driscoll, p. 37, translates the phrase in this way; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 135\u2013136.</ref> Finally, it is suggested that it was the ceremony which followed \"the custom of the Gaels\" and not the agreements.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 136; see also Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p. 188.</ref>\n\nThe idea that this gathering agreed to uphold Irish laws governing the church has suggested that it was an important step in the [[gaelicisation]] of the lands east of Druim Alban.<ref>Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 188\u2013189, writes that \"it marks the final triumph of the Gaelic order over the old Pictish order\".</ref> Others have proposed that the ceremony in some way endorsed Constantine's kingship, prefiguring later royal inaugurations at Scone.<ref>Driscoll, ''Alba'', p. 37; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', pp. 15\u201316.</ref> Alternatively, if Bishop Cellach was appointed by Giric, it may be that the gathering was intended to heal a rift between king and church.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 137\u2013138.</ref>\n\n==Return of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair==\nFollowing the events at Scone, there is little of substance reported for a decade. A story in the ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', perhaps referring to events some time after 911, claims that Queen \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d, who ruled in Mercia, allied with the Irish and northern rulers against the Norsemen on the Irish sea coasts of Northumbria. The ''Annals of Ulster'' record the defeat of an Irish fleet from the kingdom of [[Ulaid]] by Vikings \"on the coast of England\" at about this time.<ref>Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 185\u20136; ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', FA 429; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 913.</ref>\n\nIn this period the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' reports the death of [[Cormac mac Cuilenn\u00e1in]], [[king of Munster]], in the eighth year of Constantine's reign.<ref>The ''Annals of Ulster'' states that Cormac died on {{Nowrap|13 September}} 908; Woolf, pp. 127\u20139.</ref> This is followed by an undated entry which was formerly read as \"In his time Domnall [i.e. Dyfnwal], king of the [Strathclyde] Britons died, and Domnall son of \u00c1ed was elected\". This was thought to record the election of a brother of Constantine named Domnall to the kingship of the Britons of Strathclyde and was seen as early evidence of the domination of Strathclyde by the kings of Alba. The entry in question is now read as \"...Dynfwal... and Domnall son \u00c1ed [[king of Ailech]] died\", this [[Domnall Dabaill|Domnall]] being a son of [[\u00c1ed Findliath]] who died on {{Nowrap|21 March}} 915.<ref>Domnall's death is recorded by the ''Annals of Ulster''. For the re-reading by Benjamin Hudson, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 127\u2013129 and 152\u2013157; Dumville, \"Chronicle of the Kings of Alba\", p. 77. Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 222\u2013223, is typical of the interpretation found in older works. The phrase in question reads \"''et Dunenaldus filius Ede elig<sub>7</sub>''\".</ref> Finally, the deaths of Flann Sinna and [[Niall Gl\u00fandub]] are recorded.<ref>The ''Annals of Ulster'' record the death of Flann on {{Nowrap|25 May}} 916 and that of Niall on {{Nowrap|14 September}} 919; Woolf, pp. 127\u20139.</ref>\n\nThere are more reports of Viking fleets in the [[Irish Sea]] from 914 onwards. By 916 fleets under [[Sihtric C\u00e1ech]] and [[Ragnall ua \u00cdmair|Ragnall]], said to be grandsons of \u00cdmar (that is, they belonged to the same [[U\u00ed \u00cdmair]] kindred as the \u00cdmar who was killed in 904), were very active in Ireland.  Sihtric inflicted a heavy defeat on the armies of [[Leinster]] and retook Dublin in 917.<ref>Hart, \"Sihtric C\u00e1ech\"; Hart \"Ragnall\"; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138\u2013141; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 914\u2013917.</ref> The following year Ragnall appears to have returned across the Irish sea intent on establishing himself as king at [[York]].<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 142; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 918.</ref> The only precisely dated event in the summer of 918 is the death of Queen \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d on {{Nowrap|12 June}} 918 at [[Tamworth, Staffordshire]]. \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d had been negotiating with the Northumbrians to obtain their submission, but her death put an end to this and her successor, her brother [[Edward the Elder]], was occupied with securing control of Mercia.<ref>Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186\u20138; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 105, Ms. C, s.a. 918, 919.</ref>\n\n[[Image:Dere Street.JPG|thumb|[[Dere Street]]; Corbridge is just south of [[Hadrian's Wall]] in the centre of the map]]\n\nThe northern part of Northumbria, and perhaps the whole kingdom, had probably been ruled by [[Ealdred I of Bernicia|Ealdred]] son of [[Eadulf I of Bernicia|Eadulf]] since 913.<ref>Keynes, \"Rulers of the English\"; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 138\u2013141.</ref> Faced with Ragnall's invasion, Ealdred came north seeking assistance from Constantine. The two advanced south to face Ragnall, and this led to a battle somewhere on the banks of the [[River Tyne]], probably at [[Corbridge]] where [[Dere Street]] crosses the river. The [[Battle of Corbridge]] appears to have been indecisive; the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' is alone in giving Constantine the victory.<ref>There is disagreement as to whether there was one battle at Corbridge in the 910s or two. The ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 918, the ''Fragmentary Annals of Ireland'', and the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'', report only one battle. The idea that there were two rests on the ''[[Historia de Sancto Cuthberto]]'', for which see Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', p. 64. The question is discussed by Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 142\u2013144; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 332\u2013333.</ref>\n\nThe report of the battle in the ''Annals of Ulster'' says that none of the kings or [[mormaer]]s among the men of Alba were killed. This is the first surviving use of the word mormaer; other than the knowledge that Constantine's kingdom had its own bishop or bishops and royal villas, this is the only hint to the institutions of the kingdom.<ref>For Mormaers, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 342\u2013350; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 219\u2013220.

In the south, Alfred's son Edward had rapidly secured control of Mercia and had a [[burh]] constructed at [[Bakewell]] in the [[Peak District]] from which his armies could easily strike north. An army from Dublin led by Ragnall's kinsman Sihtric struck at north-western Mercia in 919, but in 920 or 921 Edward met with Ragnall and other kings. The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' states that these king \"chose Edward as father and lord\". Among the other kings present were Constantine, Ealdred son of Eadwulf, and the king of Strathclyde, [[Owain ap Dyfnwal (fl. 934)|Owain ap Dyfnwal]]. Here, again, a new term appears in the record, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' for the first time using the word ''scottas'', from which Scots derives, to describe the inhabitants of Constantine's kingdom in its report of these events.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 333\u2013335; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 104, Ms. A, s.a. 924; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 145\u2013147.</ref>\n\nEdward died in 924. His realms appear to have been divided with the West Saxons recognising [[\u00c6lfweard of Wessex|\u00c6lfweard]] while the Mercians chose [[\u00c6thelstan]] who had been raised at \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d's court. \u00c6lfweard died within weeks of his father and \u00c6thelstan was inaugurated as king of all of Edward's lands in 925.<ref>Keynes, \"Rulers of the English\", p. 514; Miller, \"\u00c6thelstan\"; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 339.</ref>\n\n==\u00c6thelstan==\nBy 926 Sihtric had evidently acknowledged [[\u00c6thelstan]] as over-king, adopting Christianity and marrying a sister of \u00c6thelstan at Tamworth. Within the year he may have abandoned his new faith and repudiated his wife, but before \u00c6thelstan and he could fight, Sihtric died suddenly in 927. His kinsman, perhaps brother, [[Gofraid ua \u00cdmair|Gofraid]], who had remained as his deputy in [[Dublin]], came from Ireland to take power in York, but failed. \u00c6thelstan moved quickly, seizing much of Northumbria. In less than a decade, the kingdom of the English had become by far the greatest power in Britain and Ireland, perhaps stretching as far north as the [[Firth of Forth]].<ref>Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', pp. 186\u2013190; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339\u2013340; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp.148\u2013151; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 105 and 107, Ms. D, s.a. 925, 926, Ms. E, F, s.a. 927.</ref>\n\n[[John of Worcester]]'s chronicle suggests that \u00c6thelstan faced opposition from Constantine, from Owain, and from the Welsh kings. [[William of Malmesbury]] writes that Gofraid, together with Sihtric's young son [[Olaf Cuaran]] fled north and received refuge from Constantine, which led to war with \u00c6thelstan. A meeting at [[Eamont Bridge]] on {{Nowrap|12 July}} 927 was sealed by an agreement that Constantine, Owain, [[Hywel Dda]], and Ealdred would \"renounce all idolatry\": that is, they would not ally with the Viking kings. William states that \u00c6thelstan stood godfather to a son of Constantine, probably [[Indulf of Scotland|Indulf]] (Ildulb mac Constant\u00edn), during the conference.<ref>Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 66\u201367; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p.107, Ms. D, s.a. 926; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 339\u2013340; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp 150\u2013152 and 192\u2013193; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 201\u2013202; Miller, \"\u00c6thelstan\".</ref>\n\n\u00c6thelstan followed up his advances in the north by securing the recognition of the Welsh kings.<ref>Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 340\u2013341.</ref> For the next seven years, the record of events in the north is blank. \u00c6thelstan's court was attended by the Welsh kings, but not by Constantine or Owain. This absence of record means that \u00c6thelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 161\u2013165. The previous year had seen the death of \u00c6thelstan's brother [[Edwin, son of Edward the Elder|Edwin]], perhaps drowned on the king's orders; Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, Ms. E, s.a. 933 and note 11; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 355\u2013356. The following year Gofraid died and was succeeded by his son Amla\u00edb, Constantine's son-in-law; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 934. Finally, the ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' report the death of \"Adulf mcEtulfe, king of the North Saxons\" in the same year as \u00c6thelstan's campaign; Woolf suggests that this may represent Ealdred, or some other son of Eadulf, ruling in Northumbria.</ref>\n\n\u00c6thelstan's campaign is reported by in brief by the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', and later chroniclers such as John of Worcester, William of Malmesbury, [[Henry of Huntingdon]], and [[Symeon of Durham]] add detail to that bald account. \u00c6thelstan's army began gathering at [[Winchester]] by {{Nowrap|28 May}} 934, and reached [[Nottingham]] by {{Nowrap|7 June}}. He was accompanied by many leaders, including the Welsh kings Hywel Dda, Idwal Foel, and [[Morgan ab Owain]]. From Mercia the army went north, stopping at [[Chester-le-Street]], before resuming the march accompanied by a fleet of ships. Owain was defeated and Symeon states that the army went as far north as Dunnottar and Fortriu, while the fleet is said to have raided [[Caithness]], by which a much larger area, including [[Sutherland]], is probably intended. It is unlikely that Constantine's personal authority extended so far north, and while the attacks may have been directed at his allies, they may also have been simple looting expeditions.<ref>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', p. 107, Ms. D, s.a. 934; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 67\u201369; Miller, \"\u00c6thelstan\"; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', p. 342; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 160\u2013166; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', p. 203.</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Annals of Clonmacnoise]]'' state that \"the Scottish men compelled [\u00c6thelstan] to return without any great victory\", while Henry of Huntingdon claims that the English faced no opposition. A negotiated settlement may have ended matters: according to John of Worcester, a son of Constantine was given as a hostage to \u00c6thelstan and Constantine himself accompanied the English king on his return south. He witnessed a charter with \u00c6thelstan at [[Buckingham]] on {{Nowrap|13 September}} 934 in which he is described as ''subregulus'', that is a king acknowledging \u00c6thelstan's overlordship.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 426; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 67\u201369; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166\u2013168; {{cite web|url=http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=get&type=charter&id=426 |title=Charter S 426 |last=Miller |first=Sean |work=Anglo-Saxons.net |accessdate=28 November 2007 }}</ref> The following year, Constantine was again in England at \u00c6thelstan's court, this time at [[Cirencester]] where he appears as a witness, appearing as the first of several subject kings, followed by Owain and Hywel Dda, who subscribed to the diploma.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 166\u2013168; only a part of this charter survives, see {{cite web |url=http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/kemble/pelteret/Lsp/Lsp%2011.htm |accessdate=28 November 2007 |title=Charter S 1792 |work=Anglo-Saxon Charters Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227002745/http://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/kemble/pelteret/Lsp/Lsp%2011.htm |archivedate=27 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> At Christmas of 935, Owain was once more at \u00c6thelstan's court along with the Welsh kings, but Constantine was not. His return to England less than two years later would be in very different circumstances.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n==Brunanburh and after==\nFollowing his disappearance from \u00c6thelstan's court after 935, there is no further report of Constantine until 937. In that year, together with Owain and [[Olaf III Guthfrithson|Olaf Guthfrithson]] of Dublin, Constantine invaded England. The resulting [[battle of Brunanburh]]\u2014''D\u00fan Brunde''\u2014is reported in the ''Annals of Ulster'' as follows:<blockquote>a great battle, lamentable and terrible was cruelly fought... in which fell uncounted thousands of the Northmen.&nbsp; ...And on the other side, a multitude of Saxons fell; but \u00c6thelstan, the king of the Saxons, obtained a great victory.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 428\u20139; ''Annals of Ulster'', s.a. 937.</ref></blockquote> The battle was remembered in England a generation later as \"the Great Battle\". When reporting the battle, the ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' abandons its usual terse style in favour of a heroic poem vaunting the great victory. In this the \"hoary\" Constantine, by now around 60 years of age, is said to have lost a son in the battle, a claim which the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' confirms. The ''Annals of Clonmacnoise'' give his name as Cellach. For all its fame, the site of the battle is uncertain and several sites have been advanced, with [[Bromborough]] on the [[Wirral Peninsula|Wirral]] the most favoured location.<ref>Swanton, ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'', pp. 106\u201310, Ms. A, s.a. 937; Anderson, ''Scottish Annals'', pp. 69\u201373; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 429; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', 168\u201373; Smyth, ''Warlords and Holy Men'', pp. 203\u20134; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 342\u20133; Scragg, \"''Battle of Brunanburh''\".</ref>\n\nBrunanburh, for all that it had been a famous and bloody battle, settled nothing. On {{Nowrap|27 October}} 939 \u00c6thelstan, the \"pillar of the dignity of the western world\" in the words of the ''Annals of Ulster'', died at [[Malmesbury]]. He was succeeded by his brother [[Edmund I of England|Edmund]], then aged 18. \u00c6thelstan's empire, seemingly made safe by the victory of Brunanburh, collapsed in little more than a year from his death when Amla\u00edb returned from Ireland and seized Northumbria and the Mercian Danelaw. Edmund spent the remainder of Constant\u00edn's reign rebuilding the empire.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 174; Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 356\u20139; Higham, ''Kingdom of Northumbria'', p. 193; Blair, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pp. 87\u20139.</ref>\n\nFor Constantine's last years as king there is only the meagre record of the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba''. The death of \u00c6thelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of [[Dubacan of Angus|Dubacan]], [[mormaer of Angus]] or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this occasion the title mormaer is attached to a geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 175, 211\u20132.</ref> The second death, entered with that of \u00c6thelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailp\u00edn, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constant\u00edn.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175.</ref>\n\n==Abdication and posterity==\nBy the early 940s Constantine was an old man, in his late 60s or early 70s. The kingdom of Alba was too new to be said to have a customary rule of succession, but Pictish and Irish precedents favoured an adult successor descended from Kenneth MacAlpin. Constantine's surviving son [[Indulf of Scotland|Indulf]], probably baptised in 927, would have been too young to be a serious candidate for the kingship in the early 940s, and the obvious heir was Constantine's nephew, [[Malcolm I of Scotland|Malcolm&nbsp;I]]. As Malcolm was born no later than 901, by the 940s he was no longer a young man, and may have been impatient. Willingly or not\u2014the 11th-century ''[[Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n]]'', a verse history in the form of a supposed prophecy, states that it was not a voluntary decision\u2014Constantine abdicated in 943 and entered a monastery, leaving the kingdom to Malcolm.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 444\u2013448; Broun, \"Constantine&nbsp;II\".</ref>\n\nAlthough his retirement may have been involuntary, the ''Life'' of [[Cathr\u00f3e of Metz]] and the ''Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n'' portray Constantine as a devout king. The monastery which Constantine retired to, and where he is said to have been [[abbot]], was probably that of [[Church of St Mary on the Rock|St Andrews]]. This had been refounded in his reign and given to the reforming [[C\u00e9li D\u00e9]] (Culdee) movement. The C\u00e9li D\u00e9 were subsequently to be entrusted with many monasteries throughout the kingdom of Alba until replaced in the 12th century by new orders imported from France.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 431\u2013444; Broun, \"Constantine&nbsp;II\"; Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', p. 175; MacQuarrie, ''Saints of Scotland'', pp. 199\u2013210. The ''Prophecy of Berch\u00e1n'' describes Constantine's \"fair, long reign\" as a time \"with fruit upon slender branches, with ale, with music, with good cheer; with corn, with milk, with nimble cattle; with pride, with fortune, with [worth]\"; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 447\u2013448.</ref>\n\nSeven years later the ''Chronicle of the Kings of Alba'' says:<blockquote>[Malcolm&nbsp;I] plundered the English as far as the [[river Tees]], and he seized a multitude of people and many herds of cattle: and the Scots called this the raid of Albidosorum, that is, Nainndisi. But others say that Constantine made this raid, asking of the king, Malcolm, that the kingship should be given to him for a week's time, so that he could visit the English. In fact, it was Malcolm who made the raid, but Constantine incited him, as I have said.<ref>Anderson, ''Early Sources'', pp. 452\u2013453.</ref></blockquote> Woolf suggests that the association of Constantine with the raid is a late addition, one derived from a now-lost saga or poem.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 178\u2013181.</ref>\n\nConstantine's death in 952 is recorded by the Irish annals, who enter it among ecclesiastics. His son Indulf would become king on Malcolm's death. The last of Constantine's certain descendants to be king in Alba was a great-grandson, [[Constantine III of Scotland|Constantine&nbsp;III]] (Constant\u00edn mac Cuil\u00e9in). Another son had died at Brunanburh, and, according to John of Worcester, Amla\u00edb mac Gofraid was married to a daughter of Constantine. It is possible that Constantine had other children, but like the name of his wife, or wives, this has not been recorded.<ref>Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 171, 175, and 177; Duncan, ''Kingship of the Scots'', p. 345, table A; Anderson, ''Early Sources'', p. 451.</ref>\n\nThe form of kingdom which appeared in Constantine's reign continued in much the same way until the [[Davidian Revolution]] in the 12th century. As with his ecclesiastical reforms, his political legacy was the creation of a new form of Scottish kingship that lasted for two centuries after his death.<ref>Broun, \"Constantine&nbsp;II\". The nature of that kingdom is, however, still a matter of debate, see Woolf, ''Pictland to Alba'', pp. 342\u2013350; {{citation |last=Grant |first=Alexander |contribution=The Construction of the Early Scottish State |title=The Medieval State: Essays presented to James Campbell |editor-last=Maddicott |editor-first=J.

Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 59.</ref> \u2013 22 May 337 AD), also known as '''Constantine I''', was a [[Roman Emperor]] who ruled between 306 and 337 AD.  Born on the territory now known as [[Ni\u0161]] ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: \u041d\u0438\u0448, located in [[Serbia]]), he was the son of [[Flavius Valerius Constantius]], a [[Roman Army]] officer of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] origins.  His mother [[Helena of Constantinople|Helena]] was Greek.  His father became ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'', the deputy emperor in the west, in 293&nbsp;AD.  Constantine was sent east, where he rose through the ranks to become a [[military tribune]] under Emperors [[Diocletian]] and [[Galerius]].  In 305, Constantius raised himself to the rank of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', senior western emperor, and Constantine was recalled west to campaign under his father in [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britannia]] (Britain).  Constantine was acclaimed as emperor by the army at [[Eboracum]] (modern-day [[York]]) after his father's death in 306 AD.  He emerged victorious in a series of civil wars against Emperors [[Maxentius]] and [[Licinius]] to become sole ruler of both west and east by 324&nbsp;AD.\n\nAs emperor, Constantine enacted administrative, financial, social, and military reforms to strengthen the empire.  He [[Praetorian prefecture|restructured]] the government, separating [[Praetorian prefect|civil]] and [[Magister militum|military]] authorities.  To combat inflation he introduced the [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]], a new [[gold coin]] that became the standard for Byzantine and European currencies for more than a thousand years.  The Roman army was reorganised to consist of [[comitatenses|mobile field units]] and [[limitanei|garrison soldiers]] capable of countering internal threats and [[barbarian invasions]].  Constantine pursued successful campaigns against the tribes on the Roman frontiers\u2014the [[Franks]], the [[Alamanni]], the [[Goths]], and the [[Sarmatians]]\u2014even resettling territories abandoned by his predecessors during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]].\n\nConstantine was the first Roman emperor to [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|convert]] to [[Christianity]].{{refn|With the possible exception of [[Philip the Arab]] (r. 244\u2013249).

He played an influential role in the proclamation of the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313, which declared religious tolerance for Christianity in the Roman empire.  He called the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325, which produced the statement of Christian belief known as the [[Nicene Creed]].  The [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] was built on his orders at the purported site of [[Jesus]]' tomb in [[Jerusalem]] and became the holiest place in [[Christendom]].  The [[Temporal power (papal)|Papal claim to temporal power]] in the [[High Middle Ages]] was based on the forged [[Donation of Constantine]].  He is venerated as a saint by the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]]es.  He has historically been referred to as the \"First Christian Emperor\", and he did heavily promote the Christian Church.  Some modern scholars, however, debate his beliefs and even his comprehension of the Christian faith itself.{{refn|Constantine was not baptised until just before his death.<ref>{{cite web |title= Constantine the Great |publisher= About.com | url= http://ancienthistory.about.com/cs/people/p/constantine.htm |accessdate= 3 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title= Constantinople: Capital of Byzantium |author= Harris, Jonathan |publisher= Bloomsbury Academic |edition= 2nd |year=2017 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b-ECDgAAQBAJ |page= 38|isbn= 9781474254670 }}</ref>|group=notes}}\n\nThe age of Constantine marked a distinct epoch in the history of the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>Gregory, ''A History of Byzantium'', 49.</ref>  He built a new imperial residence at [[Byzantium]] and renamed the city [[Constantinople]] (now [[Istanbul]]) after himself (the laudatory epithet of \"New Rome\" came later, and was never an official title).  It became the capital of the Empire for more than a thousand years, with the later eastern Roman Empire now being referred to as the [[Byzantine Empire]] by historians.  His more immediate political legacy was that he replaced Diocletian's [[tetrarchy]] with the principle of dynastic succession by leaving the empire to his sons.  His reputation flourished during the lifetime of his children and for centuries after his reign.  The medieval church upheld him as a paragon of virtue, while secular rulers invoked him as a prototype, a point of reference, and the symbol of imperial legitimacy and identity.<ref>Van Dam, ''Remembering Constantine at the Milvian Bridge'', 30.</ref>  Beginning with [[the Renaissance]], there were more critical appraisals of his reign, due to the rediscovery of anti-Constantinian sources.

This system would later be called the [[Tetrarchy]]. Diocletian's first appointee for the office of Caesar was Constantius; his second was [[Galerius]], a native of Felix Romuliana.

Galerius sent [[Flavius Valerius Severus|Severus]] against Maxentius, but during the campaign, Severus' armies, previously under command of Maxentius' father Maximian, defected, and Severus was seized and imprisoned.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30\u201331; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 41\u201342; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 62\u201363; Odahl, 86\u201387; Potter, 348\u201349.</ref> Maximian, brought out of retirement by his son's rebellion, left for Gaul to confer with Constantine in late 307&nbsp;AD. He offered to marry his daughter [[Fausta]] to Constantine and elevate him to Augustan rank. In return, Constantine would reaffirm the old family alliance between Maximian and Constantius and offer support to Maxentius' cause in Italy. Constantine accepted and married Fausta in Trier in late summer 307&nbsp;AD. Constantine now gave Maxentius his meagre support, offering Maxentius political recognition.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 64; Odahl, 87\u201388; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15\u201316.</ref>\n\nConstantine remained aloof from the Italian conflict, however. Over the spring and summer of 307 AD, he had left Gaul for Britain to avoid any involvement in the Italian turmoil;<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 30; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 62\u201363; Odahl, 86\u201387.</ref> now, instead of giving Maxentius military aid, he sent his troops against Germanic tribes along the Rhine. In 308 AD, he raided the territory of the [[Bructeri]], and made a bridge across the Rhine at Colonia Agrippinensium ([[Cologne]]). In 310 AD, he marched to the northern Rhine and fought the Franks. When not campaigning, he toured his lands advertising his benevolence and supporting the economy and the arts. His refusal to participate in the war increased his popularity among his people and strengthened his power base in the West.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 63\u201365; Odahl, 89; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 15\u201316.</ref> Maximian returned to Rome in the winter of 307\u2013308 AD, but soon fell out with his son. In early 308&nbsp;AD, after a failed attempt to usurp Maxentius' title, Maximian returned to Constantine's court.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 64; Odahl, 89, 93.</ref>\n\nOn 11 November 308 AD, Galerius called a general council at the military city of [[Carnuntum]] ([[Petronell-Carnuntum]] [[Austria]]) to resolve the instability in the western provinces. In attendance were Diocletian, briefly returned from retirement, Galerius, and Maximian. Maximian was forced to abdicate again and Constantine was again demoted to Caesar. [[Licinius]], one of Galerius' old military companions, was appointed Augustus in the western regions. The new system did not last long: Constantine refused to accept the demotion and continued to style himself as Augustus on his coinage, even as other members of the Tetrarchy referred to him as a Caesar on theirs. [[Maximinus II|Maximinus Daia]] was frustrated that he had been passed over for promotion while the newcomer Licinius had been raised to the office of Augustus and demanded that Galerius promote him. Galerius offered to call both Maximinus and Constantine \"sons of the Augusti\",<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 32\u201334; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 42\u201343; Jones, 61; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 65; Odahl, 90\u201391; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 349\u201350; Treadgold, 29.</ref> but neither accepted the new title.

Maximian had been sent south to Arles with a contingent of Constantine's army, in preparation for any attacks by Maxentius in southern Gaul. He announced that Constantine was dead, and took up the [[Tyrian purple#History|imperial purple]]. In spite of a large donative pledge to any who would support him as emperor, most of Constantine's army remained loyal to their emperor, and Maximian was soon compelled to leave. Constantine soon heard of the rebellion, abandoned his campaign against the Franks, and marched his army up the Rhine.<ref name=\"yuhknp\">Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34\u201335; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 65\u201366; Odahl, 93; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 17; Potter, 352.</ref> At Cabillunum ([[Chalon-sur-Sa\u00f4ne]]), he moved his troops onto waiting boats to row down the slow waters of the [[Sa\u00f4ne]] to the quicker waters of the [[Rhone]]. He disembarked at [[Lugdunum]] ([[Lyon]]).<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 34.</ref> Maximian fled to Massilia ([[Marseille]]), a town better able to withstand a long siege than Arles. It made little difference, however, as loyal citizens opened the rear gates to Constantine. Maximian was captured and reproved for his crimes. Constantine granted some clemency, but strongly encouraged his suicide. In July 310 AD, Maximian hanged himself.<ref name=\"yuhknp\" />\n\nIn spite of the earlier rupture in their relations, Maxentius was eager to present himself as his father's devoted son after his death.<ref>Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 68; Pohlsander, ''Emperor Constantine'', 20.</ref> He began minting coins with his father's deified image, proclaiming his desire to avenge Maximian's death.<ref>Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 68.</ref> Constantine initially presented the suicide as an unfortunate family tragedy. By 311&nbsp;AD, however, he was spreading another version. According to this, after Constantine had pardoned him, Maximian planned to murder Constantine in his sleep. Fausta learned of the plot and warned Constantine, who put a [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] in his own place in bed. Maximian was apprehended when he killed the eunuch and was offered suicide, which he accepted.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 30.1; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 40\u201341, 305.</ref> Along with using propaganda, Constantine instituted a ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'' on Maximian, destroying all inscriptions referring to him and eliminating any public work bearing his image.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 68.</ref>\n\nThe death of Maximian required a shift in Constantine's public image. He could no longer rely on his connection to the elder Emperor Maximian, and needed a new source of legitimacy.<ref>Potter, 352.</ref> In a speech delivered in Gaul on 25 July 310 AD, the anonymous orator reveals a previously unknown dynastic connection to [[Claudius II]], a 3rd-century emperor famed for defeating the Goths and restoring order to the empire. Breaking away from [[Tetrarchy|tetrarchic]] models, the speech emphasizes Constantine's ancestral prerogative to rule, rather than principles of imperial equality. The new ideology expressed in the speech made Galerius and Maximian irrelevant to Constantine's right to rule.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7); Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 35\u201337, 301; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 66; Odahl, 94\u201395, 314\u201315; Potter, 352\u201353.</ref> Indeed, the orator emphasizes ancestry to the exclusion of all other factors: \"No chance agreement of men, nor some unexpected consequence of favor, made you emperor,\" the orator declares to Constantine.<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7)1. Qtd. in Potter, 353.</ref>\n\nThe oration also moves away from the religious ideology of the Tetrarchy, with its focus on twin dynasties of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Hercules]]. Instead, the orator proclaims that Constantine experienced a divine vision of [[Apollo]] and [[Victoria (mythology)|Victory]] granting him [[laurel wreath]]s of health and a long reign. In the likeness of Apollo Constantine recognized himself as the saving figure to whom would be granted \"rule of the whole world\",<ref>''Panegyrici Latini'' 6(7).21.5.</ref> as the poet Virgil had once foretold.<ref>Virgil, ''[[Bucolics|Ecologues]]'' 4.10.</ref> The oration's religious shift is paralleled by a similar shift in Constantine's coinage. In his early reign, the coinage of Constantine advertised [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]] as his patron. From 310&nbsp;AD on, Mars was replaced by [[Sol Invictus]], a god conventionally identified with Apollo.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36\u201337; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 67; Odahl, 95.</ref> There is little reason to believe that either the dynastic connection or the divine vision are anything other than fiction, but their proclamation strengthened Constantine's claims to legitimacy and increased his popularity among the citizens of Gaul.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 36\u201337; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 50\u201353; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 66\u201367; Odahl, 94\u201395.</ref>\n\n== Civil wars ==\n{{See also|Civil wars of the Tetrarchy}}\n\n=== War against Maxentius ===\n{{Campaignbox Constantine Wars}}\nBy the middle of 310 AD, Galerius had become too ill to involve himself in imperial politics.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 31\u201335; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.16; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95\u201396, 316.</ref> His final act survives: a letter to provincials posted in Nicomedia on 30 April 311 AD, proclaiming an end to the persecutions, and the resumption of religious toleration.<ref>Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34; Eusebius, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' 8.17; Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 304; Jones, 66.</ref> He died soon after the edict's proclamation,<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 39; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 43\u201344; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 68; Odahl, 95\u201396.</ref> destroying what little remained of the tetrarchy.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41; Elliott, ''Christianity of Constantine'', 45; Lenski, \"Reign of Constantine\" (CC), 69; Odahl, 96.</ref> Maximinus mobilized against Licinius, and seized Asia Minor.

In February 313, he met with Licinius in Milan and developed the [[Edict of Milan]], which stated that Christians should be allowed to follow their faith without oppression.<ref>Bowder, Diana. ''The Age of Constantine and Julian''. New York: Barnes & Noble, 1978</ref> This removed penalties for professing Christianity, under which [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|many had been martyred previously]], and it returned confiscated Church property. The edict protected all religions from persecution, not only Christianity, allowing anyone to worship any deity that they chose. A similar edict had been issued in 311 by [[Galerius]], senior emperor of the [[Tetrarchy]], which granted Christians the right to practise their religion but did not restore any property to them.<ref>See Lactantius, ''De Mortibus Persecutorum'' 34\u201335.</ref> The Edict of Milan included several clauses which stated that all confiscated churches would be returned, as well as other provisions for previously persecuted Christians. Scholars debate whether Constantine adopted his mother [[Helena (Empress)|Helena]]'s Christianity in his youth, or whether he adopted it gradually over the course of his life.<ref>R.

In constructing the Old Saint Peter's Basilica Constantine went to great lengths to erect the basilica on top of St. Peter's resting place, so much so that it even effected the design of the basilica and even undertook the challenge of erecting it on the hill where St. Peter rested, making its complete construction time over 30 years from the date Constantine ordered it to be built.\n\nConstantine might not have patronized Christianity alone. He built a triumphal arch in 315 to celebrate his victory in the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312) which was decorated with images of the goddess [[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]], and sacrifices were made to pagan gods at its dedication, including [[Apollo]], [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]], and [[Hercules]]. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, so the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''apud'' Jonathan Bardill, '' Constantine, Divine Emperor of the Christian Golden Age''.

The African bishops could not come to terms and the Donatists asked Constantine to act as a judge in the dispute. Three regional Church councils and another trial before Constantine all ruled against Donatus and the [[Donatism]] movement in North Africa. In 317, Constantine issued an edict to confiscate Donatist church property and to send Donatist clergy into exile.<ref>Frend, W.H.C., \"The Donatist Church; A Movement of Protest in Roman North Africa,\" (1952 Oxford), pp. 156\u2013162</ref> More significantly, in 325 he summoned the [[First Council of Nicaea]], most known for its dealing with Arianism and for instituting the [[Nicene Creed]]. He enforced the Council's prohibition against celebrating the Lord's Supper on the day before the Jewish [[Passover]], which marked a definite break of Christianity from the Judaic tradition. From then on, the solar [[Julian Calendar]] was given precedence over the lunisolar [[Hebrew Calendar]] among the Christian churches of the Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/25023.htm|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Life of Constantine, Book III (Eusebius)|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nConstantine made some new laws regarding the Jews; some of them were unfavorable towards Jews, although they were not harsher than those of his predecessors.<ref name=\"Goldsworthy187\">Cf.

Senators were stripped of the command of legions and most provincial governorships, as it was felt that they lacked the specialized military upbringing needed in an age of acute defense needs;<ref>Christol & Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 241</ref> such posts were given to equestrians by Diocletian and his colleagues, following a practice enforced piecemeal by their predecessors. The emperors, however, still needed the talents and the help of the very rich, who were relied on to maintain social order and cohesion by means of a web of powerful influence and contacts at all levels. Exclusion of the old senatorial aristocracy threatened this arrangement.\n\nIn 326, Constantine reversed this pro-equestrian trend, raising many administrative positions to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices to the old aristocracy; at the same time, he elevated the rank of existing equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order in the process (at least as a bureaucratic rank).<ref>As equestrian ''order'' refers to people of equestrian ''census'' that had an actual position in the state bureaucracy, thousands of whom had no state function; cf.

The failure resided in the fact that the silver currency was overvalued in terms of its actual metal content, and therefore could only circulate at much discounted rates. He stopped minting the Diocletianic \"pure\" silver ''[[argenteus]]'' soon after 305, while the billon currency continued to be used until the 360s. From the early 300s on, Constantine forsook any attempts at restoring the silver currency, preferring instead to concentrate on minting large quantities of the gold [[solidus (coin)|solidus]], 72 of which made a pound of gold. New and highly debased silver pieces continued to be issued during his later reign and after his death, in a continuous process of retariffing, until this bullion minting ceased in 367, and the silver piece was continued by various denominations of bronze coins, the most important being the ''[[centenionalis]]''.<ref>Walter Scheidel, \"The Monetary Systems of the Han and Roman Empires\", 174/175</ref> These bronze pieces continued to be devalued, assuring the possibility of keeping fiduciary minting alongside a gold standard. The author of ''[[De Rebus Bellicis]]'' held that the rift widened between classes because of this monetary policy; the rich benefited from the stability in purchasing power of the gold piece, while the poor had to cope with ever-degrading bronze pieces.<ref>''De Rebus Bellicis'', 2.</ref> Later emperors such as [[Julian the Apostate]] insisted on trustworthy mintings of the bronze currency.<ref>Sandro Mazzarino, according to Christol & Nony, ''Rome et son Empire'', 246</ref>\n\nConstantine's monetary policies were closely associated with his religious policies; increased minting was associated with the confiscation of all gold, silver, and bronze statues from pagan temples between 331 and 336 which were declared to be imperial property. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting the statues and melting them for immediate minting, with the exception of a number of bronze statues that were used as public monuments in Constantinople.<ref>Carri\u00e9 & Rousselle, ''L'Empire Romain'', 245\u2013246</ref>\n\n=== Executions of Crispus and Fausta ===\n{{multiple image|total_width=350\n|image1=Crispus.jpg\n|caption1=Coin of Crispus\n|image2=P1070865 Louvre t\u00eate de Fausta Ma4881 rwk.JPG\n|caption2=Bust of Fausta, Louvre, Paris\n}}\nConstantine had his eldest son [[Crispus]] seized and put to death by \"cold poison\" at Pola ([[Pula]], Croatia) sometime between 15 May and 17 June 326.<ref>Guthrie, 325\u2013326.</ref> In July, he had his wife Empress [[Fausta]] (stepmother of Crispus) killed in an overheated bath.<ref>Guthrie, 326; Woods, \"Death of the Empress,\" 70\u201372.</ref> Their names were wiped from the face of many inscriptions, references to their lives were eradicated from the literary record, and [[Damnatio memoriae|the memory of both was condemned]].

In response to border raids, Constantine sent Constantius to guard the eastern frontier in 335.

He treated the war as a Christian crusade, calling for bishops to accompany the army and commissioning a tent in the shape of a church to follow him everywhere. Constantine planned to be baptized in the [[Jordan River]] before crossing into Persia. Persian diplomats came to Constantinople over the winter of 336\u2013337, seeking peace, but Constantine turned them away.

Barnes' Constantine experienced a radical conversion which drove him on a personal crusade to convert his empire.<ref>Lenski, \"Introduction\" (CC), 8\u20139; Odahl, 283.</ref> Charles Matson Odahl's ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'' (2004) takes much the same tack.<ref>Odahl, 283; Mark Humphries, \"Constantine,\" review of ''Constantine and the Christian Empire'', by Charles Odahl, ''Classical Quarterly'' 56:2 (2006), 449.</ref> In spite of Barnes' work, arguments continue over the strength and depth of Constantine's religious conversion.<ref>Averil Cameron, \"Introduction,\" in ''Constantine: History, Historiography, and Legend'', ed. Samuel N.C. Lieu and [[Dominic Montserrat]] (New York: Routledge, 1998), 3.</ref> Certain themes in this school reached new extremes in T.G. Elliott's ''The Christianity of Constantine the Great'' (1996), which presented Constantine as a committed Christian from early childhood.<ref>Lenski, \"Introduction\" (CC), 10.</ref> [[Paul Veyne]]'s 2007 work ''Quand notre monde est devenu chr\u00e9tien'' holds a similar view which does not speculate on the origin of Constantine's Christian motivation, but presents him as a religious revolutionary who fervently believed that he was meant \"to play a providential role in the millenary economy of the salvation of humanity\".<ref>[https://archive.is/20120708061334/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6404/is_2_69/ai_n29437350/?tag=content;col1 Quand notre monde est devenu chretien], Fabian E. Udoh, review, ''Theological Studies'', June 2008</ref>\n\n=== Donation of Constantine ===\n{{Main|Donation of Constantine}}\n[[Latin Rite]] Catholics considered it inappropriate that Constantine was baptized only on his death bed by an unorthodox bishop, as it undermined the authority of the Papacy, and a legend emerged by the early fourth century that [[Pope Sylvester I]] (314\u2013335) had cured the pagan emperor from leprosy. According to this legend, Constantine was soon baptized and began the construction of a church in the [[Lateran Palace]].<ref>Lieu, \"Constantine in Legendary Literature\" (CC), 298\u2013301.</ref> The [[Donation of Constantine]] appeared in the eighth century, most likely during the pontificate of [[Pope Stephen II]] (752\u2013757), in which the freshly converted Constantine gives \"the city of Rome and all the provinces, districts, and cities of Italy and the Western regions\" to Sylvester and his successors.<ref>''Constitutum Constantini'' 17, qtd. in Lieu, \"Constantine in Legendary Literature\" (CC), 301\u2013303.</ref> In the [[High Middle Ages]], this document was used and accepted as the basis for the Pope's [[Temporal power (Papal)|temporal power]], though it was denounced as a forgery by Emperor [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto III]]<ref>Henry Charles Lea, \"The 'Donation of Constantine'\". ''The English Historical Review'' 10: 37 (1895), 86\u20137.</ref> and lamented as the root of papal worldliness by [[Dante Alighieri]].<ref>''Inferno'' 19.115; ''Paradisio'' 20.55; cf. ''De Monarchia'' 3.10.</ref> Philologist [[Lorenzo Valla]] proved that the document was indeed a forgery.<ref>Fubini, 79\u201386; Lenski, \"Introduction\" (CC), 6.</ref>\n\n=== Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''Historia'' ===\nDuring the medieval period, [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] regarded Constantine as a king of their own people, particularly associating him with [[Segontium|Caernarfon]] in [[Kingdom of Gwynedd|Gwynedd]]. While some of this is owed to his fame and his proclamation as Emperor in [[Roman Britain|Britain]], there was also confusion of his family with [[Magnus Maximus]]'s supposed wife [[Saint Elen]] and her son, another Constantine {{nowrap|({{lang-cy|Custennin}})}}. In the 12th century [[Henry of Huntingdon]] included a passage in his ''Historia Anglorum'' that the Emperor Constantine's mother was a Briton, making her the daughter of [[King Cole]] of [[Colchester]].<ref>Henry of Huntingdon, ''Historia Anglorum'', Book I, ch. 37.</ref> [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] expanded this story in his highly fictionalized ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', an account of the supposed [[list of legendary kings of Britain|Kings of Britain]] from their [[Troy|Trojan]] origins to the [[Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain|Anglo-Saxon invasion]].<ref name=\"Greenway\">{{cite book |last= Greenway|first1= Diana (Ed.) |author2=Henry of Huntingdon|title= Historia Anglorum: The History of the English People|publisher= Oxford University Press|year= 1996|isbn= 978-0-19-822224-8|page=civ}}</ref> According to Geoffrey, Cole was King of the Britons when Constantius, here a senator, came to Britain. Afraid of the Romans, Cole submitted to Roman law so long as he retained his kingship. However, he died only a month later, and Constantius took the throne himself, marrying Cole's daughter Helena. They had their son Constantine, who succeeded his father as King of Britain before becoming Roman Emperor.\n\nHistorically, this series of events is extremely improbable. Constantius had already left Helena by the time he left for Britain.<ref name=\"marriage\" /> Additionally, no earlier source mentions that Helena was born in Britain, let alone that she was a princess. Henry's source for the story is unknown, though it may have been a lost hagiography of Helena.<ref name=\"Greenway\" />\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Byzantine Empire|Saints}}\n* [[Colossus of Constantine]]\n* [[Constantinian shift]]\n* [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine]]\n* [[German and Sarmatian campaigns of Constantine]]\n* [[List of Byzantine Emperors]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=notes}}\n\n== Citations ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Ancient sources ===\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n* [[Athanasius]] of Alexandria.

(technical standard) developed by [[Microsoft]] and standardized by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]<ref name=\"iso_iec_23271_2012\">[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=58046 ISO/IEC 23271:2012 - Information technology -- Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]</ref> and [[Ecma International|ECMA]]<ref name=\"ecma_355_2012\">[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm Standard ECMA-335 - 6th edition (June 2012)]</ref> that describes executable code and a runtime environment that allows multiple high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms without being rewritten for specific architectures. This implies it is platform agnostic. The [[.NET Framework]], [[.NET Core]], [[Mono (software)|Mono]], [[DotGNU]] and [[Portable.NET]] are implementations of the CLI.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Overview of the Common Language Infrastructure.svg|thumb|280px|Visual overview of the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]]\nAmong other things, the CLI specification describes the following four aspects:\n\n;The [[Common Type System]] (CTS)\n:A set of [[data type]]s and operations that are shared by all CTS-compliant [[programming language]]s.\n;The [[Metadata (CLI)|Metadata]]\n:Information about program structure is [[Language-independent specification|language-agnostic]], so that it can be referenced between languages and tools, making it easy to work with code written in a language the developer is not using.\n;The Common Language Specification (CLS)\n:A set of base rules to which any language targeting the CLI should conform in order to interoperate with other CLS-compliant languages. The CLS rules define a subset of the Common Type System.\n;The [[Virtual Execution System]] (VES)\n:The VES loads and executes CLI-compatible programs, using the metadata to combine separately generated pieces of code at runtime.\n\nAll compatible languages compile to [[Common Intermediate Language]] (CIL), which is an [[intermediate language]] that is abstracted from the platform hardware. When the code is executed, the platform-specific VES will compile the CIL to the [[machine language]] according to the specific hardware and operating system.\n\n==Standardization and licensing==\nIn August 2000, [[Microsoft]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Intel]], and others worked to standardize CLI. By December 2001, it was ratified by the [[Ecma International|ECMA]], with [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standardization following in April 2003.\n\nMicrosoft and its partners hold patents for CLI. ECMA and ISO require that all patents essential to implementation be made available under \"[[Reasonable and Non Discriminatory Licensing|reasonable and non-discriminatory (RAND) terms]].\" It is common for RAND licensing to require some royalty payment, which could be a cause for concern with [[Mono (software)|Mono]]. As of January 2013, neither Microsoft nor its partners have identified any patents essential to CLI implementations subject to RAND terms.\n\nAs of July 2009,<ref>{{Cite web\n|url=http://port25.technet.com/archive/2009/07/06/the-ecma-c-and-cli-standards.aspx\n|title=The ECMA C# and CLI Standards - Port 25: The Open Source Community at Microsoft\n|date=2009-07-06\n}}</ref> [[Microsoft]] added [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and CLI to the list of specifications that the [[Microsoft Community Promise]] applies to,<ref name=\"mcp_covered_specifications\">[http://www.microsoft.com/openspecifications/en/us/programs/community-promise/covered-specifications/default.aspx Covered Specifications | Microsoft Open Specifications]</ref> so anyone can safely implement specified editions of the standards without fearing a patent lawsuit from Microsoft. To implement the CLI standard requires conformance to one of the supported and defined profiles of the standard, the minimum of which is the kernel profile. The kernel profile is actually a very small set of types to support in comparison to the well known core library of default .NET installations. However, the conformance clause of the CLI allows for extending the supported profile by adding new methods and types to classes, as well as deriving from new namespaces. But it does not allow for adding new members to interfaces. This means that the features of the CLI can be used and extended, as long as the conforming profile implementation does not change the behavior of a program intended to run on that profile, while allowing for unspecified behavior from programs written specifically for that implementation.\n\nIn 2012, ECMA and ISO published the new edition of the CLI standard,<ref name=\"iso_iec_23271_2012\">[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=58046 ISO/IEC 23271:2012 - Information technology -- Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)]</ref><ref name=\"ecma_355_2012\">[http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm Standard ECMA-335 - 6th edition (June 2012)]</ref> which is not covered by the Community Promise.<ref name=\"mcp_covered_specifications\"/>\n\n==Implementations==\n*[[.NET Framework]] is Microsoft's original commercial implementation of the CLI. Its [[Virtual Execution System]] is the [[Common Language Runtime]] and its implementation of the [[Standard Libraries (CLI)|Standard Libraries]] is the [[Framework Class Library]].\n*[[.NET Compact Framework]] is Microsoft's commercial implementation of the CLI for portable devices and [[Xbox 360]].\n*[[.NET Micro Framework]] is an open source implementation of the CLI for resource-constrained devices.\n*[[Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure]] is a reference implementation of the CLI available from Microsoft, under the [[Shared Source]] licensing program.\n*[[.NET Core]] is a portable and modular free and open-source fork of Microsoft's .NET Framework by the [[.NET Foundation]] under an [[MIT license]]\n*[[Mono (software)|Mono development platform]] is an [[open source]] implementation of CLI and accompanying technologies, sponsored by [[Xamarin]].\n*[[Portable.NET]], part of the [[dotGNU]] project, is a [[free software]] implementation of ECMA-335 by [[Free Software Foundation]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Standard Libraries (CLI)]]\n*[[List of CLI languages]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite web\n|title = Standard ECMA-335, Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)\n|work = ECMA International\n|url = http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-335.htm\n|accessdate = August 31, 2005\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n|title = ISO/IEC 23271, Common Language Infrastructure\n|work = ISO\n|url = http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=42927\n|accessdate = September 27, 2006\n}}\n*{{Cite web\n|title = ECMA C# and Common Language Infrastructure Standards\n|work = Microsoft Corporation\n|url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/aa569283.aspx\n|accessdate = October 13, 2009\n}}\n\n{{Common Language Infrastructure}}\n{{Ecma International Standards}}\n{{ISO standards}}\n\n[[Category:Common Language Infrastructure]]\n[[Category:Ecma standards]]\n[[Category:IEC standards]]\n[[Category:ISO standards]]", "sha1": "l9240r8467bmqp3vv4chnsasplhmjaj"}}, {"title": "Cricket World Cup", "ns": "0", "id": "7239", "revision": {"id": "866115630", "parentid": "865931430", "timestamp": "2018-10-28T10:16:59Z", "contributor": {"username": "G\u00fcnniX", "id": "237572"}, "minor": "", "comment": "v2.0 - [[WP:WCW]] project (Double pipe in a link)", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{pp-vandalism|expiry=12:00, 1 September 2019|small=yes}}\n{{About|the men's tournament|the women's tournament|Women's Cricket World Cup|the upcoming tournament|2019 Cricket World Cup|the Twenty20 tournament|ICC World Twenty20}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}{{Infobox cricket tournament main\n| name = ICC Cricket World Cup\n| image = Icc cricket world cup trophy.jpg\n| imagesize = 150px\n| caption = The World Cup Trophy\n| administrator = [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC)\n| cricket format = [[One Day International]]\n| tournament format = [[#Format|\u2193various]]\n| first = [[1975 Cricket World Cup|1975]] <small>([[England]])</small>\n| last = [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]] <small>([[Australia]], [[New Zealand]])</small>\n| current = \n| next = [[2019 Cricket World Cup|2019]] <small>([[England]], [[Wales]])</small>\n| participants = 20 <small>(all tournaments)</small><br>14 <small>(until 2015)</small><br>10 <small>(current)</small>\n| champions = {{cr|AUS}} (5th title)\n| most successful = {{cr|AUS}} (5 titles)\n| most runs = {{flagicon|IND}} [[Sachin Tendulkar ]] (2,278)\n| most wickets = {{flagicon|Australia}} [[Glenn McGrath]] (71)\n|drs=Yes}}\n{{Infobox\n|bodyclass = hlist nowraplinks\n|headerstyle = border-top:1px solid #aaa\n|header1 = Tournaments\n|data2 = \n* [[1975 Cricket World Cup|1975]]\n* [[1979 Cricket World Cup|1979]]\n* [[1983 Cricket World Cup|1983]]\n* [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]]\n* [[1992 Cricket World Cup|1992]]\n* [[1996 Cricket World Cup|1996]]\n* [[1999 Cricket World Cup|1999]]\n* [[2003 Cricket World Cup|2003]]\n* [[2007 Cricket World Cup|2007]]\n* [[2011 Cricket World Cup|2011]]\n* [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015]]\n* ''[[2019 Cricket World Cup|2019]]''\n* ''[[2023 Cricket World Cup|2023]]''\n}}\n\nThe '''ICC Cricket World Cup''' is the [[World cup competition|international championship]] of [[One Day International]] (ODI) [[cricket]]. The event is organised by the sport's governing body, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), every four years, with preliminary qualification rounds leading up to a finals tournament. The tournament is one of the world's most viewed sporting events and is considered the \"flagship event of the international cricket calendar\" by the ICC.<ref>[http://www.cricketworldcup.com/about ICC Cricket World Cup: About] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601200603/http://www.cricketworldcup.com/about |date=1 June 2013 }} \u2013 International Cricket Council. Retrieved 30 June 2013.</ref>\n\nThe first World Cup was organised [[1975 Cricket World Cup|in England in June 1975]], with the first ODI cricket match having been played only four years earlier. However, a separate [[Women's Cricket World Cup]] had been held two years before the first men's tournament, and a tournament involving multiple international teams had been held as early as 1912, when a [[1912 Triangular Tournament|triangular tournament]] of [[Test cricket|Test matches]] was played between [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]], [[England national cricket team|England]] and [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]]. The first three World Cups were held in England. From the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987 tournament]] onwards, hosting has been shared between countries under an [[Cricket World Cup hosts#Unofficial rotation system|unofficial rotation system]], with fourteen ICC members having hosted at least one match in the tournament.\n\nThe World Cup is open to all members of the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC), although the highest-ranking teams receive automatic qualification. The remaining teams are determined via the [[World Cricket League]] and the [[ICC World Cup Qualifier]]. A total of [[#Overview|twenty teams]] have competed in the eleven editions of the tournament, with fourteen competing in the latest edition in 2015; [[2019 Cricket World Cup|the next edition]] in 2019 will have only ten teams.

Every two years the meeting is held in a different member state and is chaired by that nation's respective Prime Minister or President who becomes the [[Commonwealth Chair-in-Office]] until the next meeting.

They are held once every two years, although this pattern has twice been interrupted.  They are held around the Commonwealth, rotating by invitation amongst its members.\n\nIn the past, CHOGMs have attempted to orchestrate common policies on certain contentious issues and current events, with a special focus on issues affecting member nations.  CHOGMs have discussed the continuation of [[apartheid]] rule in South Africa and how to end it, military coups in [[Pakistan]] and [[Fiji]], and allegations of electoral fraud in [[Zimbabwe]].  Sometimes the member states agree on a common idea or solution, and release a joint statement declaring their opinion.  More recently, beginning at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1997|1997 CHOGM]], the meeting has had an official 'theme', set by the host nation, on which the primary discussions have been focused.<ref name=\"Edinburgh Diary\">{{cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Ingram (journalist) |date=January 1998 |title=Edinburgh Diary |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=87 |issue=345 |pages=13\u201316 |url=  |doi=10.1080/00358539808454395 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Refimprove section|date=January 2013}}\n[[File:CommonwealthPrimeMinisters1944.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The heads of government of five members of the Commonwealth of Nations at the 1944 Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference.]]\nThe meetings originated with the leaders of the self-governing colonies of the [[British Empire]].<ref name=\"Seminars for Statesmen\">{{cite journal |last=Mole |first=Stuart |date=September 2004 |title=Seminars for statesmen': the evolution of the Commonwealth summit  |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=376 |pages=533\u2013546 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1080/0035853042000289128 }}</ref> The [[First Colonial Conference]] in 1887 was followed by periodic meetings, known as [[Imperial Conference]]s from 1907, of government leaders of the Empire.  The development of the independence of the [[dominion]]s, and the creation of a number of new dominions, as well as the invitation of [[Southern Rhodesia]] (which also attended as a ''sui generis'' colony),<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watts |first=Carl P. |date=July 2007 |title=Dilemmas of Intra-Commonwealth Representation during the Rhodesian Problem, 1964\u201365 |journal=Commonwealth & Comparative Politics |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=323\u201344 |url=  |doi=10.1080/14662040701516904  }}</ref> changed the nature of the meetings.<ref name=\"Seminars for Statesmen\" /> As the dominion leaders asserted themselves more and more at the meetings, it became clear that the time for 'imperial' conferences was over.\n\nFrom the ashes of the [[Second World War]], seventeen [[Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference]]s were held between 1944 and 1969.  Of these, sixteen were held in London, reflecting then-prevailing views of the Commonwealth as the continuation of the Empire and the centralisation of power in the British [[Commonwealth Office]] (the one meeting outside London, in [[Lagos]], was an extraordinary meeting held in January 1966 to co-ordinate policies towards [[Rhodesia]]).  Two supplementary meetings were also held during this period: a Commonwealth Statesmen's meeting to discuss peace terms in April 1945, and a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952.\n\nThe 1960s saw an overhaul of the Commonwealth.  The swift expansion of the Commonwealth after [[decolonization|decolonisation]] saw the newly independent countries demand the creation of the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], and the United Kingdom, in response, successfully founding the [[Commonwealth Foundation]].<ref name=\"Canada and the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat\">{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/40203725 |last=McIntyre |first=W.

Instead of the meetings always being held in London, they would rotate across the membership, subject to countries' ability to host the meetings: beginning with Singapore [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|in 1971]].  They were also renamed the 'Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings' to reflect the growing diversity of the constitutional structures in the Commonwealth.\n\n==Structure==\n\nThe core of the CHOGM are the executive sessions, which are the formal gatherings of the heads of government to do business.  However, the majority of the important decisions are held not in the main meetings themselves, but at the informal 'retreats': introduced at [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1973|the second CHOGM]], in [[Ottawa]], by [[Canadian Prime Minister|Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Pierre Trudeau]],<ref name=\"Twenty Commonwealth steps\" /> but reminiscent of the excursions to [[Chequers]] or [[Dorneywood]] in the days of the Prime Ministers' Conferences.<ref name=\"Seminars for Statesmen\" /> The rules are very strict: allowing the head of the delegation, his or her spouse, and one other person.  The additional member can be of any capacity (personal, political, security, etc.), but he or she has only occasional and intermittent access to the head.<ref name=\"Seminars for Statesmen\" />  It is usually at the retreat where, isolated from their advisers, the heads resolve the most intransigent issues: leading to the [[Gleneagles Agreement]] in 1977, the [[Lusaka Declaration]] in 1979, the [[Langkawi Declaration]] in 1989, the [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme|Millbrook Programme]] in 1995, the [[Aso Rock Declaration]] in 2003,<ref name=\"Seminars for Statesmen\" /> and the Colombo Declaration on Sustainable, Inclusive and Equitable Development in 2013.\n\nThe 'fringe' of [[civil society]] organisations, including the [[Commonwealth Family]] and local groups, adds a cultural dimension to the event, and brings the CHOGM a higher media profile and greater acceptance by the local population.<ref name=\"Twenty Commonwealth steps\" /> First officially recognised at [[Limassol]] in 1993,<ref name=\"Seminars for Statesmen\" /> these events, spanning a longer period than the meeting itself, have, to an extent, preserved the length of the CHOGM: but only in the cultural sphere.<ref name=\"Twenty Commonwealth steps\" />  Other meetings, such as those of the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]], [[Commonwealth Business Council]], and respective [[foreign minister]]s, have also dealt with business away from the heads of government themselves.\n\nAs the scope of the CHOGM has expanded beyond the meetings of the heads of governments themselves, the CHOGMs have become progressively shorter, and their business compacted into less time.<ref name=\"Twenty Commonwealth steps\">{{cite journal |last=Ingram |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Ingram (journalist) |date=October 2007 |title=Twenty Commonwealth steps from Singapore to Kampala |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=96 |issue=392 |pages=555\u2013563 |url= |accessdate= |doi=10.1080/00358530701625877 }}</ref> The [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|1971 CHOGM]] lasted for nine days, and the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977|1977]] and [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1991|1991 CHOGMs]] for seven days each.  However, Harare's epochal CHOGM was the last to last a week; the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1993|1993 CHOGM]] lasted for five days, and the contentious [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1995|1995 CHOGM]] for only three-and-a-half.<ref name=\"Seminars for Statesmen\" /> The 2005 and subsequent conferences were held over two to two-and-a-half-days. However, recent CHOGMs have also featured several days of pre-summit Commonwealth Forums on business, women, youth, as well as the Commonwealth People's Forum and meetings of foreign ministers.\n\n==Issues==\n[[File:CHOGM 2011 protest gnangarra-86.jpg|thumb|right|Protests during the 2011 CHOGM in [[Perth]]]]\nDuring the 1980s, CHOGMs were dominated by calls for the Commonwealth to impose sanctions on South Africa to pressure the country to end [[apartheid]]. The division between Britain, during the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]] which resisted the call for sanctions and African Commonwealth countries, and the rest of the Commonwealth was intense at times and led to speculation that the organisation might collapse.  According to one of Margaret Thatcher's former aides, Mrs. Thatcher, very privately, used to say that CHOGM stood for \"Compulsory Handouts to Greedy Mendicants.\"<ref>PBS Video, The Windsors:  A Royal Family (1994)</ref>\n\nIn 2011, British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] informed the British House of Commons that his proposals to reform the rules governing [[Succession to the British throne|royal succession]], a change which would require the approval of all sixteen [[Commonwealth realm]]s, was approved at the 28\u201330 October CHOGM in [[Perth]], subsequently referred to as the [[Perth Agreement]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Commonwealth to discuss changing royal succession|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5iQBXOEaqhXB8n2AVM3CxXqSjJnHQ?docId=CNG.9072c392d6cd2797c34abb5603c745e0.771|accessdate=15 October 2011|newspaper=Agence France Presse|date=12 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Agenda==\nUnder the [[Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme]], each CHOGM is responsible for renewing the remit of the [[Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group]], whose responsibility it is to uphold the [[Harare Declaration]] on the core political principles of the Commonwealth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/Internal/20723/34458/the_millbrook_commonwealth_action_programme/ |title=The Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme on the Harare Declaration, 1995 |accessdate=22 July 2007 |date=12 November 1995 |publisher=Commonwealth Secretariat }}</ref>\n\n==Incidents==\nA [[Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing|bomb exploded at the Sydney Hilton Hotel]], the venue for the February 1978 Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting. Twelve foreign heads of government were staying in the hotel at the time. Most delegates were evacuated by [[Royal Australian Air Force]] helicopters and the meeting was moved to [[Bowral]], protected by 800 soldiers of the [[Australian Army]].\n\nAs the convocation of heads of governments and permanent Commonwealth staff and experts, CHOGMs are the highest institution of action in the Commonwealth, and rare occasions on which Commonwealth leaders all come together.  CHOGMs have been the venues of many of the Commonwealth's most dramatic events.  [[Robert Mugabe]] announced [[Zimbabwe]]'s immediate withdrawal from the Commonwealth at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2003|2003 CHOGM]],<ref>{{cite journal |last= |first= |date=January 2004 |title=Editorial: CHOGM 2003, Abuja, Nigeria |journal=[[The Round Table Journal|The Round Table]] |volume=93 |issue=373 |pages=3\u20136 |url=  |doi=10.1080/0035853042000188139 }}</ref> and [[Nigeria]]'s execution of [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] and eight others on the first day of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1995|1995 CHOGM]] led to that country's suspension.<ref name=\"Twenty Commonwealth steps\" />\n\nIt has also been the trigger of a number of events that have shaken participating countries domestically.  The departure of [[President of Uganda|Uganda's President]] [[Milton Obote]] to the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1971|1971 CHOGM]] allowed [[Idi Amin]] to overthrow Obote's government.  Similarly, [[President of Seychelles|President]] [[James Mancham]]'s attendance of the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1977|1977 CHOGM]] gave Prime Minister [[France-Albert Ren\u00e9]] the opportunity to seize power in the [[Seychelles]].<ref name=\"Twenty Commonwealth steps\" />\n\n==List of meetings==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#cccccc\"\n!

All of these pre-Qin texts were written in [[classical Chinese]]. All three canons are collectively known as the '''classics''' (<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7d93}}}}, <small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small>&nbsp;{{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u7ecf}}}}, ''j\u012bng'', <small>lit.</small>&nbsp;\"[[warp (weaving)|warp]]\").<ref name=Voorst>{{cite book|title=Anthology of World Scriptures|author=Voorst, Robert E. Van|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2007|isbn=0-495-50387-8|page=140}}</ref>\n\nChinese classic texts may more broadly refer to texts written either in [[vernacular Chinese]] or in the classical Chinese that was current until the fall of the last imperial dynasty, the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], in 1912. These can include ''shi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u53f2}}}}, [[Chinese historiography|historical works]]), ''zi'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5b50}}}}, [[Chinese philosophy|philosophical works]] belonging to schools of thought other than the [[Confucianism|Confucian]] but also including works on agriculture, [[Traditional Chinese medicine|medicine]], mathematics, [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], divination, art criticism, and other miscellaneous writings) and ''ji'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u96c6}}}}, literary works) as well as ''[[jing (Chinese medicine)]]''.\n\nIn the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and Qing dynasties, the Four Books and Five Classics were the subject of mandatory study by those [[Confucianism|Confucian]] scholars who wished to take the [[imperial exams]] to become [[mandarin (official)|government officials]]. Any political discussion was full of references to this background, and one could not be one of the [[Scholar-bureaucrats|literati]] (or, in some periods, even a military officer) without having memorized them. Generally, children first memorized the [[Chinese characters]]  of the \"[[Three Character Classic]]\" and the \"[[Hundred Family Surnames]]\" and then went on to memorize the other classics. The literate elite therefore shared a common culture and set of values.\n\nScholarship on these texts naturally divides itself into two periods, before and after the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|burning of the books]] during the fall of the Qin dynasty, when many of the original pre-Qin texts were lost.<ref name=Voorst/>\n\n==Before 221 BC==\nIt is often difficult or impossible to precisely date pre-Qin works beyond their being \"pre-Qin\", a period of 1000 years. Information in ancient China was often passed down orally for generations before being written down, so the order of composition of the texts need not be the same as that of their attributed \"authors\".<ref>Cambridge History of Ancient China chapter 11</ref>\n\nThe below list is therefore organized in the order found in the [[Siku Quanshu]], the imperial library of the Qing dynasty. The Siku classifies all works into 4 top-level branches: the Confucian Classics and their secondary literature; history; philosophy; and poetry. There are sub-categories within each branch, but due to the small number of pre-Qin works in the Classics, History and Poetry branches, the sub-categories are only reproduced for the Philosophy branch.\n\n==Classics branch==\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!Title\n!Description\n|-\n|The ''[[I Ching]]'' (or ''Book of Changes'')\n|A manual of divination based on the eight [[bagua|trigram]]s attributed to the mythical figure [[Fuxi]] (by at least the time of the early Eastern Zhou these eight trigrams had been multiplied to sixty-four [[Hexagram (I Ching)|hexagram]]s). The ''I Ching'' is still used by modern adherents of [[folk religion]].\n|-\n|The ''[[Classic of History]]'' or ''Book of Documents'' (''Shu Jing'')\n|A collection of documents and speeches allegedly from the [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]], [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] and [[Western Zhou]] periods, and even earlier. It contains some of the earliest examples of Chinese prose.\n|- \n|The ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'' (''Shi Jing'') \n|Made up of 305 poems divided into 160 folk songs, 74 minor festal songs, traditionally sung at court festivities, 31 major festal songs, sung at more solemn court ceremonies, and 40 hymns and eulogies, sung at sacrifices to gods and ancestral spirits of the royal house. This book is traditionally credited as a compilation from Confucius. A standard version, named ''Maoshi Zhengyi'', was compiled in the mid-7th century under the leadership of [[Kong Yingda]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawpark.jimdo.com/list-of-36/detailed-list-19-24/ |title=Detailed List 19-24 - lawpark's JimdoPage! |publisher=Lawpark.jimdo.com |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-04-30}}</ref>\n|-\n!The Three Rites\n|\n|-\n|The ''[[Rites of Zhou]]''\n|Conferred the status of a classic in the 12th century (in place of the lost ''Classic of Music'').\n|-\n|The ''[[Yili (text)|Book of Etiquette and Ceremonial]]'' (''Yi Li'') \n|Describes ancient rites, social forms and court ceremonies.\n|-\n|The ''[[Classic of Rites]]'' (''Li Chi'') \n|Describes social forms, administration, and ceremonial rites.\n|-\n!The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]''\n|Chronologically the earliest of the [[annals]]; comprising about 16,000 characters, it records the events of the [[State of Lu]] from 722 BC to 481 BC, with implied condemnation of usurpations, murder, incest, etc.\n|-\n| The ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'' (''Commentary of Zuo'')\n| A different report of the same events as the ''Spring and Autumn Annals'' with a few significant differences.

The term \"call centre\" was first published and recognized by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] in 1983. The 1980s experienced the development of [[toll-free telephone numbers]] to increase the efficiency of agents and overall call volume.  Call centres increased with the deregulation of [[long distance calling]] and growth in information dependent industries.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Bottom-Line Call Center Management |last=Butler |first=David L. |work=Books.google.com |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann}}</ref>\n\nAs call centres expanded, unionisation occurred in [[North America]] to gain members<ref>{{cite book |first1=Pradeep |last1=Kumar |first2=Christopher Robert |last2=Schenk |title=Paths to Union Renewal |publisher=Broadview Press |year=2006 |isbn=1-55193-058-7}}</ref> including the [[Communications Workers of America]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cwa-union.org/news/entry/Improving_Call_Center_Jobs_a_Top_Priority_for_CWA_Customer_Service_Activist/ |title=Improving Call Center Jobs a Top Priority for CWA Customer Service |publisher=Communication Workers of America |accessdate=2011-02-23}}</ref> and the [[United Steelworkers]].

A contact centre is defined as a coordinated system of people, processes, technologies and strategies that provides access to information, resources, and expertise, through appropriate channels of communication, enabling interactions that create value for the customer and organisation.<ref>[[Brad Cleveland|Cleveland, Brad]], \"Call Center Management on Fast Forward (Third Edition)\", ''ICMI Press'', 2012</ref><ref name=\"Cactus Search\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |title=Cactus Search - List of Call Centre Management Roles We Recruit |publisher=Cactus Search |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129062129/http://www.cactussearch.co.uk/content/clients/roles-we-recruit |archivedate=2014-11-29 |df= }}</ref> In contrast to in-house management, outsourced bureau contact centres are a model of contact centre that provide services on a \"pay per use\" model. The overheads of the contact centre are shared by many clients, thereby supporting a very cost effective model, especially for low volumes of calls. The modern contact center has developed more complex systems, which require highly skilled operational and management staff that can use [[multichannel marketing|multichannel]] online and offline tools to improve customer interaction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nea.com/blog/reinventing-customer-service-the-modern-contact-center |title=Reinventing customer service: the modern contact center |last=Viswanathan |first=Ravi |last2=Sandell |first2=Scott |date=21 June 2016 |website=Nea.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.genesys.com/solutions/contact-center-modernization |title=Contact Center Modernization |last=Staff |year=2016 |website=Genesys.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/cis/features/articles/301771-history-advancement-the-contact-center-the-customer-experience.htm |title=The History and Advancement of the Contact Center and the Customer Experience |last=Bernier |first=Paula |date=3 August 2012 |website=Tmcnet.com}}</ref>\n\n==Technology==\n[[File:Callcentreterminal.JPG|thumb|Call centre worker confined to a small workstation/booth, using [[CallWeb]] Internet-based survey software]]\n{{multiple image|caption_align=left\n | header_align=center\n | footer_align=center\n | align = right\n | total_width = 380\n | image1 =Call centre desk lakeland florida.jpg| width1 = 2288 | height1 =1712\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 =Workstation\n | image2 =Aspect Tel-set telephone call centre.jpg | width2 = 1535 | height2 = 1112\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 =A typical call centre telephone.

Automatic lead selection or lead steering is also intended to improve efficiencies,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7035699/description.html |title=US Patent 7035699 - Qualified and targeted lead selection and delivery system |date=2006-04-25 |publisher=Patent Storm |accessdate=2008-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125122611/http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/7035699/description.html |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}</ref> both for inbound and outbound campaigns. This allows inbound calls to be directly routed to the appropriate agent for the task, whilst minimising wait times and long lists of irrelevant options for people calling in. For outbound calls, lead selection allows management to designate what type of leads go to which agent based on factors including skill, socioeconomic factors and past performance and percentage likelihood of closing a sale per lead.\n\nThe [[universal queue]] standardises the processing of communications across multiple technologies such as fax, phone, and email. The [[virtual queue]] provides callers with an alternative to waiting on hold when no agents are available to handle inbound call demand.\n\n===Premises-based technology===\nHistorically, call centres have been built on [[Private branch exchange]] (PBX) equipment that is owned, hosted, and maintained by the call centre operator themselves. The PBX can provide functions such as [[automatic call distribution]], [[interactive voice response]], and [[skills-based routing]].\n\n===Virtual call centre===\n{{see also|Software as a service|Telecommuting}}\nIn virtual call centre model, the call centre operator pays a monthly or annual fee to a vendor that hosts the call centre telephony equipment in their own data centre. In this model, the operator does not own, operate or host the equipment that the call centre runs on. Agents connect to the vendor's equipment through traditional [[Public switched telephone network|PSTN]] telephone lines, or over [[voice over IP]]. Calls to and from prospects or contacts originate from or terminate at the vendor's data centre, rather than at the call centre operator's premises. The vendor's telephony equipment then connects the calls to the call centre operator's agents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/kapq5p85xnhrwe5b/ |author=M. Popovic and V. Kovacevic |title=An Approach to Internet-Based Virtual Call Center Implementation |publisher=University of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia}}</ref>\n\nVirtual call centre technology allows people to work from home, instead of in a traditional, centralised, call centre location, which increasingly allows people with physical or other disabilities that prevent them from leaving the house, to work. The only required equipment is Internet access and a workstation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nticentral.org/about/articles/nnyt03012006.shtm |author=David S.

Inbound call centres can be outsourced or managed in-house.\n\nThese healthcare call centres are designed to help streamline communications, enhance patient retention and satisfaction, reduce expenses and improve operational efficiencies.\n\n===Hospitality===\nMany large hospitality companies such as the [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] and [[Marriott International]] make use of call centres to manage reservations. These are known in the industry as \"central reservations offices\". Staff members at these call centres take calls from clients wishing to make reservations or other inquiries via a public number, usually a [[Toll-free number|1-800 number]]. These centres may operate as many as 24 hours per day, seven days a week, depending on the call volume the chain receives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=RqTgAAAAMAAJ&q=%22central+reservations+office%22&dq=%22central+reservations+office%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwizmviI9MfWAhXEwlQKHR1KAbMQ6AEIOjAD|title=Managing Front Office Operations|last=Kasavana|first=Michael L.|last2=Brooks|first2=Richard M.|date=1998|publisher=Educational Institute of the American Hotel & Motel Association|isbn=9780866121798|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Evaluation==\n\n=== Mathematical theory ===\n{{see also|Erlang distribution}}\n[[Queueing theory]] is a branch of mathematics in which models of service systems have been developed.

The purpose of [[list of Messier objects|the catalogue]] was to help astronomical observers, in particular [[comet]] hunters like himself, distinguish between permanent and [[transient astronomical event|transient]] visually diffuse [[astronomical object|objects in the sky]].\n\n==Biography==\nMessier was born in [[Badonviller]] in the [[Lorraine (r\u00e9gion)|Lorraine]] region of [[Kingdom of France|France]], being the tenth of twelve children of Fran\u00e7oise B. Grandblaise and Nicolas Messier, a [[Court usher]]. Six of his brothers and sisters died while young and in 1741, his father died. Charles' interest in astronomy was stimulated by the appearance of the spectacular, [[C/1743 X1|great six-tailed comet]] in 1744 and by an annular [[solar eclipse]] visible from his hometown on 25 July 1748.\n\nIn 1751 he entered the employ of [[Joseph Nicolas Delisle]], the astronomer of the [[French Navy]], who instructed him to keep careful records of his observations. Messier's first documented observation was that of the [[Transit of Mercury|Mercury transit]] of 6 May 1753, followed by his [https://bibnum.obspm.fr/ark:/11287/Lbf8m#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.0556%2C-0.3733%2C1.1111%2C1.9323 observations journals at Cluny Hotel] and [https://bibnum.obspm.fr/ark:/11287/FkRnB#?c=0&m=0&s=0&cv=0&z=-0.0556%2C-0.2517%2C1.1111%2C1.9323 at the French Navy observatories].\n\nIn 1764, he was made a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]; in 1769, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]; and on 30 June 1770, he was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].\n\nMessier discovered 13 comets&nbsp;:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comethunter.de/cat2002/com_disc.txt |title=Maik Meyer.

According to Meyer:<ref>{{cite book|author=Meyer, Maik|title=Charles Messier, Napoleon, and Comet C/1769 P1|year=2007|page=3|url=http://www.icq.eps.harvard.edu/meyer_icq29_3t6.pdf}}</ref>{{quotation| As hard as it may seem to accept, the memoir is an ingratiation to Napoleon in order to receive attention and monetary support.

The grave is fairly plain and faintly inscribed, and while it is not on most maps of the cemetery, it can be found near the grave of [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin]], slightly to the west and directly north, and behind the small mausoleum of the jeweller [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]].\n\n==The Messier catalogue==\n{{see also|Messier object}}\n[[File:M42m.jpg|thumb|right|The Orion Nebula which Messier gave the designation [[Messier 42|M42]] in his catalogue]]\nMessier's occupation as a [[comet]] hunter led him to continually come across fixed diffuse objects in the night sky which could be mistaken for comets.

The entries are now known to be [[galaxies]] (39), [[planetary nebula]]e (5), other types of [[nebula]]e (7), and [[star cluster]]s (55).\n\nMessier did his observing with a 100&nbsp;mm (four inch) [[refracting telescope]] from H\u00f4tel de Cluny (now the [[Mus\u00e9e national du Moyen \u00c2ge]]), in downtown [[Paris]], [[France]].

They are not organized scientifically by object type, or even by location. The first version of Messier's catalogue contained 45 objects and was published in 1774 in the journal of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in Paris. In addition to his own discoveries, this version included objects previously observed by other astronomers, with only 17 of the 45 objects being Messier's.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=J.D.|title=Meet the Astronomers: Charles Messier|url=http://www.seasky.org/space-exploration/astronomers-charles-messier.html|website=Sea and Sky|accessdate=2 September 2014}}</ref> By 1780 the catalog had increased to 80 objects.\n\nThe final version of the catalogue was published in 1781, in the 1784 issue of ''[[Connaissance des Temps]]''.<ref>Charles Messier, 1781.

In particular, it presents evidence that the tendency to produce one or the other sex of child is, to some extent, heritable.\n\nIn 1910, he acceded to the Chair of Statistics in the [[University of Cagliari]] and then at [[University of Padua|Padua]] in 1913.\n\nHe founded the statistical journal ''Metron'' in 1920, directing it until his death;  it only accepted articles with practical applications.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://meetings.sis-statistica.org/index.php/ginilegacy/index/about/editorialPolicies|title=Corrado Gini's Biography|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Statistica (SIS)|access-date=2016-11-05}}</ref>\n\nHe became a professor at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]] in 1925.

In a [[reciprocating engine]], it translates [[reciprocating motion]] of the [[piston]] into rotational motion; whereas in a [[reciprocating compressor]], it converts the rotational motion into reciprocating motion. In order to do the conversion between two motions, the crankshaft has \"crank throws\" or \"[[crankpin]]s\", additional bearing surfaces whose axis is offset from that of the crank, to which the \"big ends\" of the [[connecting rod]]s from each cylinder attach.\n\nIt is typically connected to a [[flywheel]] to reduce the pulsation characteristic of the [[four-stroke cycle]], and sometimes a [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional]] or vibrational damper at the opposite end, to reduce the [[torsional vibration]]s often caused along the length of the crankshaft by the cylinders farthest from the output end acting on the torsional elasticity of the metal.\n[[Image:Crank operation.png|thumb|Schematic of operation of a crank mechanism]]\n\n==History==\n=== East Asia ===\n====Han China====\n{{Main article|Science and technology of the Han dynasty}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-BB-152-11, Tibetexpedition, Tibeter mit Handm\u00fchle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tibetan people|Tibetan]] operating a [[Quern-stone|quern]] (1938).

His wind-powered [[sawmill]] used a crankshaft to convert a windmill's circular motion into a back-and-forward motion powering the saw. Corneliszoon was granted a [[patent]] for his crankshaft in 1597.\n\n==== Modern Europe ====\nFrom the 16th century onwards, evidence of cranks and connecting rods integrated into machine design becomes abundant in the technological treatises of the period: [[Agostino Ramelli]]'s ''The Diverse and Artifactitious Machines'' of 1588 depicts eighteen examples, a number that rises in the ''Theatrum Machinarum Novum'' by [[Georg Andreas B\u00f6ckler]] to 45 different machines.<ref>{{harvnb|White, Jr.|1962|p=172}}</ref> Cranks were formerly common on some machines in the early 20th century; for example almost all [[phonograph]]s before the 1930s were powered by [[clockwork]] motors wound with cranks. Reciprocating piston engines use cranks to convert the linear piston motion into rotational motion. [[Internal combustion engine]]s of early 20th century [[automobile]]s were usually started with hand cranks, before [[Automobile self starter|electric starters]] came into general use. The 1918 [[REO Motor Car Company|Reo]] owner's manual describes how to hand crank the automobile:\n\n* First: Make sure the gear shifting lever is in neutral position.\n* Second: The clutch pedal is unlatched and the clutch engaged. The brake pedal is pushed forward as far as possible setting brakes on the rear wheel.\n* Third: See that spark control lever, which is the short lever located on top of the steering wheel on the right side, is back as far as possible toward the driver and the long lever, on top of the steering column controlling the carburetor, is pushed forward about one inch from its retarded position.\n* Fourth: Turn ignition switch to point marked \"B\" or \"M\"\n* Fifth: Set the carburetor control on the steering column to the point marked \"START.\" Be sure there is gasoline in the carburetor. Test for this by pressing down on the small pin projecting from the front of the bowl until the carburetor floods. If it fails to flood it shows that the fuel is not being delivered to the carburetor properly and the motor cannot be expected to start. See instructions on page 56 for filling the vacuum tank.\n* Sixth: When it is certain the carburetor has a supply of fuel, grasp the handle of starting crank, push in endwise to engage ratchet with crank shaft pin and turn over the motor by giving a quick upward pull. Never push down, because if for any reason the motor should kick back, it would endanger the operator.\n\n=== Middle East ===\n[[Al-Jazari]] (1136&ndash;1206) described a crank and connecting rod system in a rotating machine in two of his water-raising machines.<ref name=Crank>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]].

Note locomotive on left for size reference]]\nLarge [[internal combustion engine|engine]]s are usually [[engine configuration|multicylinder]] to reduce pulsations from individual firing [[stroke (engines)|strokes]], with more than one piston attached to a complex crankshaft. Many [[small engine]]s, such as those found in [[moped]]s or garden machinery, are single cylinder and use only a single piston, simplifying crankshaft design.\n\nA crankshaft is subjected to enormous stresses, potentially equivalent of several tonnes of force. The crankshaft is connected to the fly-wheel (used to smooth out shock and convert energy to [[torque]]), the engine block, using bearings on the main journals, and to the pistons via their respective con-rods. An engine loses up to 75% of its generated energy in the form of friction, noise and vibration in the crankcase and piston area.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The remaining losses occur in the valvetrain (timing chains, belts, pulleys, camshafts, lobes, valves, seals etc.) heat and blow by.\n\n===Bearings===\nThe crankshaft has a linear [[Axis of rotation|axis]] about which it rotates, typically with several [[bearing journal]]s riding on replaceable [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] (the [[main bearing]]s) held in the engine block. As the crankshaft undergoes a great deal of sideways load from each cylinder in a multicylinder engine, it must be supported by several such bearings, not just one at each end. This was a factor in the rise of [[V8 engine]]s, with their shorter crankshafts, in preference to [[straight-8]] engines. The long crankshafts of the latter suffered from an unacceptable amount of flex when engine designers began using higher [[compression ratio]]s and higher rotational speeds. High performance engines often have more main bearings than their lower performance cousins for this reason.\n\n===Piston stroke===\nThe distance the axis of the crank throws from the axis of the crankshaft determines the piston [[stroke (engines)|stroke]] measurement, and thus [[engine displacement]]. A common way to increase the low-speed torque of an engine is to increase the stroke, sometimes known as \"shaft-stroking.\" This also increases the [[engine balance|reciprocating vibration]], however, limiting the high speed capability of the engine. In compensation, it improves the low speed operation of the engine, as the longer intake stroke through smaller valve(s) results in greater turbulence and mixing of the intake charge. Most modern high speed production engines are classified as \"over square\" or short-stroke, wherein the stroke is less than the diameter of the [[cylinder bore]].  As such, finding the proper balance between shaft-stroking speed and length leads to better results.\n\n===Engine configuration===\nThe [[Engine configuration|configuration]], meaning the number of pistons and their placement in relation to each other leads to [[straight engine|straight]], [[V engine|V]] or [[flat engine]]s. The same basic [[engine block]] can sometimes be used with different crankshafts, however, to alter the [[firing order]]. For instance, the 90\u00b0 [[V6 engine]] configuration, in older days{{when|date=November 2016}} sometimes derived by using six cylinders of a [[V8 engine]] with a 3 throw crankshaft, produces an engine with an [[V6 engine#Odd and even firing|inherent pulsation in the power flow]] due to the \"gap\" between the firing pulses alternates between short and long pauses because the 90 degree engine block does not correspond to the 120 degree spacing of the crankshaft. The same engine, however, can be made to provide evenly spaced power pulses by using a crankshaft with an individual crank throw for each cylinder, spaced so that the pistons are actually phased 120\u00b0 apart, as in the [[GM 3800 engine]]. While most production V8 engines use four crank throws spaced 90\u00b0 apart, high-performance V8 engines often use a \"flat\" crankshaft with throws spaced 180\u00b0 apart, essentially resulting in two [[straight four engine]]s running on a common crankcase. The difference can be heard as the flat-plane crankshafts result in the engine having a smoother, higher-pitched sound than cross-plane (for example, [[IndyCar Series|IRL IndyCar Series]] compared to [[Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]], or a [[Ferrari 355]] compared to a [[Chevrolet Corvette]]). This type of crankshaft was also used on early types of V8 engines. See the main article on [[crossplane]] crankshafts.\n\n===Engine balance===\nFor some engines it is necessary to provide [[counterweight]]s for the reciprocating mass of each piston and connecting rod to improve [[engine balance]]. These are typically cast as part of the crankshaft but, occasionally, are bolt-on pieces. While counter weights add a considerable amount of weight to the crankshaft, it provides a smoother running engine and allows higher RPM levels to be reached.\n\n===Flying arms===\n[[File:Crankshaft jap grayscale.jpg|thumb|left|Crankshaft with flying arms (the boomerang-shaped link between the visible crank pins)]]\nIn some [[engine configuration]]s, the crankshaft contains direct links between adjacent crank pins, without the usual intermediate main bearing. These links are called ''flying arms''.{{sfn|Nunney|2007|pp=16, 41}} This arrangement is sometimes used in [[V6 engine|V6]] and [[V8 engine]]s, as it enables the engine to be designed with different V angles than what would otherwise be required to create an even firing interval, while still using fewer main bearings than would normally be required with a single piston per crankthrow. This arrangement reduces weight and engine length at the expense of less crankshaft rigidity.{{clear|left}}\n\n===Rotary aircraft engines===\nSome early aircraft engines were a [[rotary engine]] design, where the crankshaft was fixed to the [[airframe]] and instead the cylinders rotated with the propeller.\n\n===Radial engines===\nThe [[radial engine]] is a reciprocating type internal combustion engine configuration in which the cylinders point outward from a central crankshaft like the spokes of a wheel. It resembles a stylized star when viewed from the front, and is called a \"star engine\" (German Sternmotor, French Moteur en \u00e9toile) in some languages. The radial configuration was very commonly used in aircraft engines before turbine engines became predominant.\n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:Marine Crankshafts 8b03602r.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Continental engine]] marine crankshafts, 1942]]\n\nCrankshafts can be monolithic (made in a single piece) or assembled from several pieces. Monolithic crankshafts are most common, but some smaller and larger engines use assembled crankshafts.\n\n===Forging and casting===\n[[File:IPH Kurbelwelle.jpg|thumb|Forged crankshaft]]\nCrankshafts can be [[forging|forged]] from a steel bar usually through roll forging or [[casting (metalworking)|cast]] in ductile steel. Today more and more manufacturers tend to favor the use of forged crankshafts due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent damping. With forged crankshafts, [[Vanadium#Applications|vanadium]] microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Cast iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as those found in the Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron crankshafts for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.\n\n===Machining===\nCrankshafts can also be [[Machining|machined]] out of a [[Billet (manufacturing)|billet]], often a bar of high quality vacuum remelted steel. Though the fiber flow (local inhomogeneities of the material's chemical composition generated during casting) doesn\u2019t follow the shape of the crankshaft (which is undesirable), this is usually not a problem since higher quality steels, which normally are difficult to forge, can be used. These crankshafts tend to be very expensive due to the large amount of material that must be removed with lathes and milling machines, the high material cost, and the additional heat treatment required. However, since no expensive tooling is needed, this production method allows small production runs without high costs.\n\nIn an effort to reduce costs, used crankshafts may also be machined. A good core may often be easily reconditioned by a crankshaft grinding <ref>{{cite web|title=Crankshaft Grinding|url=http://crankshaftrepair.org/grinding/|publisher=Crankshaft Repair}}</ref> process. Severely damaged crankshafts may also be repaired with a welding operation, prior to grinding, that utilizes a submerged arc welding machine. To accommodate the smaller journal diameters a ground crankshaft has, and possibly an over-sized thrust dimension, undersize engine bearings are used to allow for precise clearances during operation.\n\nMachining or remanufacturing crankshafts are precision machined to exact tolerances with no odd size crankshaft bearings or journals. Thrust surfaces are micro-polished to provide precise surface finishes for smooth engine operation and reduced thrust bearing wear. Every journal is inspected and measured with critical accuracy. After machining, oil holes are chamfered to improve lubrication and every journal polished to a smooth finish for long bearing life. Remanufactured crankshafts are thoroughly cleaned with special emphasis to flushing and brushing out oil passages to remove any contaminants. Remanufacturing a crankshaft typically involves the following steps:<ref>{{Cite web|title = Remanufactured Crankshafts - Capital Reman Exchange|url = http://capitalremanexchange.com/remanufactured-crankshafts/|website = Capital Reman Exchange|accessdate = 2015-12-28|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\n==== Cleaning and inspection ====\nMachine shops soak the crankshafts in a hot tank and power wash the overall shaft. The oil holes are then wire brushed. A [[magnetic particle inspection]] checks for cracks. The crankshaft is magnetized and sprayed with an [[iron oxide]] powder which, under blacklight conditions, makes any imperfections visible. \n\nThe counterweights are removed, cleaned, and checked for cracks and tightness. The bolts of loose counterweights are replaced. The counterweights are then installed back into the crankshafts, which are inspected for damage. A machinist determines the size and hardness of the journals and mains. \n\nA technician checks the keyway, nose, and bolt holes, then seals the surface for non-conformities. Bolt holes are typically tapped \u00bd\u201d or less on remanufactured crankshafts. The bearings and the straightness of the crankshaft are also inspected, and it must be re-straightened with an industrial straightening machine if not up to OEM standards. The straightening machine determines how many dials are out of line. To re-straighten the shaft, technicians heat the crankshaft to 500-600 degrees. Any more than 700 degrees takes the hardness out of the shaft. \n\nThe magnetic particle inspection is repeated after the crankshaft has been straightened.\n\n==== Stamp counterweight webbing ====\nThe counterweights and webbing are stamped in proper firing order (alpha if numeric and vice versa). Technicians then stamp the employee ID#, Work Order # and date on #1 rod webbing. Stamping this information on the rod webbing helps keep the quality control process order in case of future issues during the manufacturing process.\n\n==== Undercutting and thermal spraying ====\nTechnicians undercut the rod or journals to eliminate wear before buildup. Further buildup and corrosion is typically prevented via [[thermal spraying]], which involves protrusion of molten particles onto the heated metallic surface, forming a smooth coating interwoven into the structure. Typically, boron alloys are used for this process, as they very dense, hard, and oxide-free. They prevent against abrasive materials that cause divots, scratches, and cracks, and prevent surface erosion and corrosion. \n\n==== Welding ====\nThe welding process for re-manufactured crankshafts is called submerged arc welding. It is a powdered flux plus a weld which combines to produce a more precise weld. The most common flux powder used is called #1 Flux 2245 HD. This powder eliminates the need for technicians to wear weld masking and reduces the amount of dust by-product.\n\n==== Relieving stress and rechecking for straightness  ====\nThe crankshaft is once more heated to 500-600 degrees to relieve structural stress. Its overall straightness is also rechecked. If the re-manufactured crankshaft is out of alignment, then the technician must re-straighten the structure. \n\n==== Crankshaft grinding ====\nCrankshaft grinding involves rough grinding the excess material from the rod or journals. On the rod there are various mains that need to be reground to proper OEM specifications. These rods are spun grind to the next under-size using the pultrusion crankshaft grinding machine. Rod mains are ground inside and outside. \n\nThe technician then performs a finished crankshaft grinding procedure, which is a more precise grind which reaches the correct OEM specifications. Before the technician starts the crankshaft grinding they should see what crankshaft bearings are available and start from there. For example, the OEM specification for a Caterpillar 3306 Rod is 2.9987\u201d \u2013 3.0003\u201d. Top industrial crankshaft grinding technicians always stop at the high end of the tolerance level. \n\n==== Shot peening ====\n[[Shot peening]] adds an additional layer of hardness to the re-manufactured crankshaft.\n\n==== Replacing counterweights and determining proper balance  ====\nThe counterweights are replaced in proper firing order. Either the new counterweights are installed or the old counterweight bolts are re-tightened.\n\nThe machine shop then determines if the proper rotational balance of the re-manufactured crankshafts is achieved. In the engine, the crankshaft, pistons, and rods are all in a constant rotation. The counterweights are designed to offset the weight of the rod and the pistons. When in motion, the kinetic energy and the sum of all forces should be equal to zero on all moving parts. If the counterweights are imbalanced, it adds additional stress on other components of the engine. The technician must ensure that the internal and external balance of the crankshaft counterweights are properly aligned.\n\n==== Micro-polishing and testing Rockwell hardness ====\nThe technician micro-polishes each of the rebuilt crankshafts by hand. To further refine the crankshaft grinding process the machinist makes the most precise fit by micro-polishing the component with a 600-grit emery cloth. Through micro-polishing and industrial crankshaft grinding, the machine shop achieves the recommended Rockwell hardness and Ra finish (Roughness Parameter).\n\nIndustry standard crankshaft hardness is 40 on the [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell hardness scale]]. A 45-50 rating is what most reputable machine shops try to employ for all remanufactured crankshafts. Typically, hardness can be reduced if the engine is out of oil or the journal is spun incorrectly.\n\n==== Final steps ====\nQuality control inspects all of the finished crankshafts mistakes. A typical quality control department uses separate testing and analytical measurement tools from the technicians to ensure accuracy. The remanufactured crankshafts are then rustproofed using [[Cosmoline]] and packaged in damage-proof coverings.\n\n===Microfinishing===\nMicrofinishing is a method of finishing the surface of the crankshaft in such a manner that microscopic roughness, pitting or cracking is reduced to a smooth, integral surface. Crankshafts fail by fatigue cracking and cracks start at the most highly stressed point in the material, which is the surface. Once a crack has developed, it increases the local stress in the area at its 'V' point, which slowly increases the size of the crack. The objective of microfinishing is to reduce to the smallest number and size any deviation in the surface and thus minimize the opportunity for cracks to develop. Increased requirements on microfinishing has become a common requirement as Industries are moving towards lead-free bearings. Improved performance and longevity are associated with the microfinishing requirements.\n\n===Fatigue strength===\nThe fatigue strength of crankshafts is usually increased by using a radius at the ends of each main and crankpin bearing. The radius itself reduces the stress in these critical areas, but since the radius in most cases is rolled, this also leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which prevents cracks from forming.\n\n===Hardening===\nMost production crankshafts use induction hardened bearing surfaces, since that method gives good results with low costs. It also allows the crankshaft to be reground without re-hardening. But high performance crankshafts, billet crankshafts in particular, tend to use [[nitridization]] instead. Nitridization is slower and thereby more costly, and in addition it puts certain demands on the alloying metals in the steel to be able to create stable nitrides. The advantage of nitridization is that it can be done at low temperatures, it produces a very hard surface, and the process leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which is good for fatigue properties. The low temperature during treatment is advantageous in that it doesn\u2019t have any negative effects on the steel, such as [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. With crankshafts that operate on roller bearings, the use of [[carburization]] tends to be favored due to the high [[Hertzian contact stress]]es in such an application. Like nitriding, carburization also leaves some compressive residual stresses in the surface.\n\n===Counterweights===\nSome expensive, high performance crankshafts also use heavy-metal counterweights to make the crankshaft more compact. The heavy-metal used is most often a [[tungsten]] alloy but [[depleted uranium]] has also been used. A cheaper option is to use lead, but compared with tungsten its density is much lower.\n\n==Stress on crankshafts==\nThe shaft is subjected to various forces but generally needs to be analysed in two positions. Firstly, failure may occur at the position of maximum bending; this may be at the centre of the crank or at either end. In such a condition the failure is due to bending and the pressure in the cylinder is maximal. Second, the crank may fail due to twisting, so the conrod needs to be checked for shear at the position of maximal twisting. The pressure at this position is the maximal pressure, but only a fraction of maximal pressure.''{{Clarify|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Counter-rotating crankshafts==\n\nIn a conventional piston-crank arrangement in an engine or compressor, a piston is connected to a crankshaft by a connecting rod. As the piston moves through its stroke, the connecting rod varies its angle to the direction of motion of the piston and as the connecting rod is free to rotate at its connection to both the piston and crankshaft, no torque is transmitted by the connecting rod and forces transmitted by the connecting rod are transmitted along the longitudinal axis of the connecting rod. The force exerted by the piston on the connecting rod results in a reaction force exerted by the connecting rod back on the piston. When the connecting rod makes an angle to the direction of motion of the piston, the reaction force exerted by the connecting rod on the piston has a lateral component. This lateral force pushes the piston sideways against the cylinder wall. As the piston moves within the cylinder, this lateral force causes additional friction between the piston and cylinder wall. Friction accounts for approximately 20% of all losses in an internal combustion engine, of which approximately 50% is due to piston cylinder friction <ref>{{citation|title=Company\u2019s perspective in vehicle tribology. In: 18th Leeds-Lyon Symposium (eds D Dowson, CM Taylor and MGodet), Lyon, France, 3-6 September 1991|author=[[Andersson BS]]|publisher=[[New York: Elsevier]]|year=1991|pages=503-506}}</ref>\n\nIn a paired counter-rotating crankshaft arrangement, each piston is connected to two crankshafts so lateral forces due to the angle of the connecting rods cancel each other out. This reduces piston-cylinder friction and therefore fuel consumption. The symmetrical arrangement reduces the requirement for counterweights, reducing overall mass and making it easier for the engine to accelerate and decelerate. It also eliminates engine rocking and torque effects. Several counter-rotating crankshaft arrangements have been patented, for example US2010/0263621.\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons|Crankshaft}}\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Crankset|Bicycle crankset]]\n*[[Brace (tool)]]\n*[[Cam]]\n*[[Camshaft]]\n*[[Crankcase]], the housing that surrounds the crankshaft\n*[[Torsional vibration#Crankshaft torsional vibration|Crankshaft torsional vibration]]\n*[[Crank (mechanism)]]\n*[[Hudson Motor Car Company]], balanced crankshaft in 1916 allowed higher RPM & more power\n*[[Piston motion equations]]\n*[[Tunnel crankshaft]]\n*[[Sun and planet gear]]\n* [[Scotch yoke]]\n* [[swashplate]]\n* [[Cam engine#Swashplate and wobble plate engines|wobble plate]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{Citation\n | last = Hall\n | first = Bert S.\n | title = The Technological Illustrations of the So-Called \"Anonymous of the Hussite Wars\".

The white matter consists of [[axon]]s and [[oligodendrocyte]]s, while the gray matter consists of [[neuron]]s and unmyelinated fibers. Both tissues include a number of [[glia]]l cells (although the white matter contains more), which are often referred to as supporting cells of the central nervous system. Different forms of glial cells have different functions, some acting almost as scaffolding for neuroblasts to climb during [[neurogenesis]] such as [[bergmann glia]], while others such as [[microglia]] are a specialized form of [[macrophage]], involved in the [[immune system]] of the brain as well as the clearance of various [[metabolite]]s from the [[brain tissue]].<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /> [[Astrocyte]]s may be involved with both clearance of metabolites as well as transport of fuel and various beneficial substances to neurons from the [[capillary|capillaries]] of the brain.

The nerves connect the spinal cord to skin, joints, muscles etc. and allow for the transmission of [[Efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] motor as well as [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent sensory signals]] and stimuli.<ref name=\"Kandel\" /> This allows for voluntary and involuntary motions of muscles, as well as the perception of senses.\nAll in all 31 spinal nerves project from the brain stem,<ref name=\"Kandel\" /> some forming plexa as they branch out, such as the [[brachial plexus|brachial plexa]], [[sacral plexus|sacral plexa]] etc.<ref name=\"Moore's\" /> Each spinal nerve will carry both sensory and motor signals, but the nerves synapse at different regions of the spinal cord, either from the periphery to sensory relay neurons that relay the information to the CNS or from the CNS to motor neurons, which relay the information out.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe spinal cord relays information up to the brain through spinal tracts through the \"final common pathway\"<ref name=\"Kandel\" /> to the [[thalamus]] and ultimately to the cortex.\n<gallery>\nFile:1615 Locations Spinal Fiber Tracts.jpg|Schematic image showing the locations of a few tracts of the spinal cord.\nFile:1507 Short and Long Reflexes.jpg|Reflexes may also occur without engaging more than one neuron of the central nervous system as in the below example of a short reflex.\n</gallery>\n\n====Cranial nerves====\nApart from the spinal cord, there are also peripheral nerves of the PNS that synapse through intermediaries or [[Ganglion|ganglia]] directly on the CNS. These 12 nerves exist in the head and neck region and are called [[cranial nerves]]. Cranial nerves bring information to the CNS to and from the face, as well as to certain muscles (such as the [[trapezius muscle]], which is innervated by [[accessory nerve]]s<ref name=\"Moore's\" /> as well as certain [[cervical spinal nerve]]s).<ref name=\"Moore's\" />\n\nTwo pairs of cranial nerves; the [[olfactory nerve]]s and the [[optic nerve]]s<ref name=\"Purves 2000\"/> are often considered structures of the central nervous system. This is because they do not synapse first on peripheral ganglia, but directly on central nervous neurons. The olfactory epithelium is significant in that it consists of central nervous tissue expressed in direct contact to the environment, allowing for administration of certain pharmaceuticals and drugs.\n<ref name=\"Gizurarson S. 2012 566\u2013582\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align       = left\n| direction   = horizontal\n| total_width = 640\n| image1      = Periferal nerve myelination.jpg\n| alt1        = Image showing the way Schwann cells myelinate periferal nerves.\n| width1      = 822\n| height1     = 232\n| caption1    = \n| image2      = Neuron with oligodendrocyte and myelin sheath.svg\n| alt2        = A neuron of the central nervous system, myelinated by an oligodendrocyte\n| width2      = 410\n| height2     = 485\n| caption2    = \n| footer      = A peripheral nerve myelinated by [[Schwann cell]]s (left) and a CNS neuron myelinated by an [[oligodendrocyte]] (right)\n}}{{clear left}}\n\n===Brain===\n{{main article|Brain}}\nRostrally to the spinal cord lies the brain.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\nThe brain makes up the largest portion of the central nervous system, and is often the main structure referred to when speaking of the nervous system.

While the spinal cord has certain processing ability such as that of [[spinal locomotion]] and can process [[reflex]]es, the brain is the major processing unit of the nervous system.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n====Brainstem====\n{{main article|Brainstem}}\nThe brainstem consists of the [[medulla oblongata|medulla]], the [[pons]] and the [[midbrain]]. The medulla can be referred to as an extension of the spinal cord, and its organization and functional properties are similar to those of the spinal cord.<ref name=\"Kandel\" /> The tracts passing from the spinal cord to the brain pass through here.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nRegulatory functions of the medulla nuclei include control of the [[blood pressure]] and [[breathing]]. Other nuclei are involved in [[balance (ability)|balance]], [[taste]], [[hearing]] and control of muscles of the [[face]] and [[neck]].<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe next structure rostral to the medulla is the pons, which lies on the ventral anterior side of the brainstem. Nuclei in the pons include [[pontine nuclei]] which work with the [[cerebellum]] and transmit information between the cerebellum and the [[cerebral cortex]].<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\nIn the dorsal posterior pons lie nuclei that have to do with breathing, sleep and taste.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe midbrain (or mesencephalon) is situated above and rostral to the pons, and includes nuclei linking distinct parts of the motor system, among others the cerebellum, the [[basal ganglia]] and both [[cerebral hemisphere]]s. Additionally parts of the visual and auditory systems are located in the mid brain, including control of automatic eye movements.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe brainstem at large provides entry and exit to the brain for a number of pathways for motor and autonomic control of the face and neck through cranial nerves,<ref name=\"Kandel\" /> and autonomic control of the organs is mediated by the tenth cranial ([[vagus]]) nerve.<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\" /><!-- page 98-199 --> A large portion of the brainstem is involved in such autonomic control of the body. Such functions may engage the [[heart]], [[blood vessels]], [[pupil]]lae, among others.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe brainstem also hold the [[reticular formation]], a group of nuclei involved in both [[arousal]] and [[alertness]].<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\n====Cerebellum====\n{{main article|Cerebellum}}\nThe cerebellum lies behind the pons. The cerebellum is composed of several dividing fissures and lobes. Its function includes the control of posture, and the coordination of movements of parts of the body, including the eyes and head as well as the limbs. Further it is involved in motion that has been learned and perfected though practice, and will adapt to new learned movements.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\nDespite its previous classification as a motor structure, the cerebellum also displays connections to areas of the cerebral cortex involved in language as well as [[cognition|cognitive functions]]. These connections have been shown by the use of [[medical imaging]] techniques such as [[fMRI]] and [[Positron emission tomography|PET]].<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe body of the cerebellum holds more neurons than any other structure of the brain including that of the larger [[cerebrum]] (or cerebral hemispheres), but is also more extensively understood than other structures of the brain, and includes fewer types of different neurons.<ref name=\"Kandel\" /> It handles and processes sensory stimuli, motor information as well as balance information from the [[vestibular organ]].<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\n====Diencephalon====\n{{main article|Diencephalon|Thalamus|Hypothalamus}}\nThe two structures of the diencephalon worth noting are the thalamus and the hypothalamus. The thalamus acts as a linkage between incoming pathways from the peripheral nervous system as well as the optical nerve (though it does not receive input from the olfactory nerve) to the cerebral hemispheres. Previously it was considered only a \"relay station\", but it is engaged in the sorting of information that will reach cerebral hemispheres ([[neocortex]]).<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nApart from its function of sorting information from the periphery, the thalamus also connects the cerebellum and basal ganglia with the cerebrum. In common with the aforementioned reticular system the thalamus is involved in wakefullness and consciousness, such as though the [[Suprachiasmatic nucleus|SCN]].<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe hypothalamus engages in functions of a number of primitive emotions or feelings such as [[hunger]], [[thirst]] and [[maternal bond]]ing. This is regulated partly through control of secretion of [[hormone]]s from the [[pituitary gland]]. Additionally the hypothalamus plays a role in [[motivation]] and many other behaviors of the individual.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\n====Cerebrum====\n{{main article|Cerebrum|Cerebral cortex|Basal ganglia|Amygdala|Hippocampus}}\nThe cerebrum of cerebral hemispheres make up the largest visual portion of the human brain. Various structures combine to form the cerebral hemispheres, among others: the cortex, basal ganglia, amygdala and hippocampus. The hemispheres together control a large portion of the functions of the human brain such as emotion, memory, perception and motor functions. Apart from this the cerebral hemispheres stand for the cognitive capabilities of the brain.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nConnecting each of the hemispheres is the [[corpus callosum]] as well as several additional [[commissure]]s.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\nOne of the most important parts of the cerebral hemispheres is the cortex, made up of gray matter covering the surface of the brain. Functionally, the cerebral cortex is involved in planning and carrying out of everyday tasks.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\nThe hippocampus is involved in storage of memories, the amygdala plays a role in perception and communication of emotion, while the basal ganglia play a major role in the coordination of voluntary movement.<ref name=\"Kandel\" />\n\n===Difference from the peripheral nervous system===\n[[File:1205 Somatic Autonomic Enteric StructuresN.jpg|thumb|350px|right|A map over the different structures of the nervous systems in the body, showing the CNS, [[Parasympathetic nervous system|PNS]], and [[Enteric nervous system|ENS]].]]\n\nThis differentiates the central nervous system from the peripheral nervous system, which consists of neurons, axons and [[Schwann cells]]. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells have similar functions in the central and peripheral nervous system respectively. Both act to add [[myelin]] sheaths to the axons, which acts as a form of insulation allowing for better and faster proliferation of electrical signals along the nerves. Axons in the central nervous system are often very short (barely a few millimeters) and do not need the same degree of isolation as peripheral nerves do. Some peripheral nerves can be over 1m in length, such as the nerves to the big toe. To ensure signals move at sufficient speed, myelination is needed.\n\nThe way in which the Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes myelinate nerves differ. A Schwann cell usually myelinates a single axon, completely surrounding it. Sometimes they may myelinate many axons, especially when in areas of short axons.<ref name=\"Moore's\">{{cite book|last=Arthur F. Dalley|first=Keith L. Moore, Anne M.R.

The anterior (or 'rostral') portion of the neural tube initially differentiates into three brain [[Vesicle (embryology)|vesicles]] (pockets): the [[prosencephalon]] at the front, the [[mesencephalon]], and, between the mesencephalon and the spinal cord, the [[rhombencephalon]]. (By six weeks in the human embryo) the prosencephalon then divides further into the [[telencephalon]] and [[diencephalon]]; and the rhombencephalon divides into the [[metencephalon]] and [[myelencephalon]].  The spinal cord is derived from the posterior or 'caudal' portion of the neural tube.\n\nAs a vertebrate grows, these vesicles differentiate further still. The telencephalon differentiates into, among other things, the [[striatum]], the [[hippocampus]] and the [[neocortex]], and its cavity becomes the [[lateral ventricles|first and second ventricles]]. Diencephalon elaborations include the [[subthalamus]], [[hypothalamus]], [[thalamus]] and [[epithalamus]], and its cavity forms the [[third ventricle]]. The [[tectum]], [[pretectum]], [[cerebral peduncle]] and other structures develop out of the mesencephalon, and its cavity grows into the [[mesencephalic duct]] (cerebral aqueduct).

In [[bacteria]], which lack a [[cell nucleus]], the cell cycle is divided into the B, C, and D periods. The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication. DNA replication occurs during the C period. The D period refers to the stage between the end of DNA replication and the splitting of the bacterial cell into two daughter cells.<ref name=\"Wang2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang JD, Levin PA | title = Metabolism, cell growth and the bacterial cell cycle | journal = Nature Reviews.

During interphase, the cell grows, accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis, preparing it for cell division and duplicating its DNA. During the mitotic phase, the chromosomes separate. During the final stage, cytokinesis, the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells. To ensure the proper division of the cell, there are control mechanisms known as [[cell cycle checkpoint]]s.\n\nThe cell-division cycle is a vital process by which a single-celled [[fertilized egg]] develops into a mature organism, as well as the process by which [[hair]], [[skin]], [[blood cell]]s, and some [[viscus|internal organs]] are renewed. After cell division, each of the daughter cells begin the [[interphase]] of a new cycle. Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell division\n\n== Phases ==\n\nThe cell cycle consists of four distinct phases: [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub> phase]], [[S phase]] (synthesis), [[G2 phase|G<sub>2</sub> phase]] (collectively known as [[interphase]]) and [[Mitosis|M phase]] (mitosis or meiosis). M phase is itself composed of two tightly coupled processes: karyokinesis, in which the cell's [[chromosomes]] are divided, and [[cytokinesis]], in which the cell's [[cytoplasm]] divides forming two daughter cells. Activation of each phase is dependent on the proper progression and completion of the previous one.

Although the various stages of interphase are not usually morphologically distinguishable, each phase of the cell cycle has a distinct set of specialized biochemical processes that prepare the cell for initiation of cell division.\n\n===G<sub>0</sub> phase (quiescence)===\n[[File:Plant cell cycle.svg|thumb|Plant cell cycle]]\n[[File:Animal cell cycle-en.svg|thumb|Animal cell cycle]]\nG<sub>0</sub> is a resting phase where the cell has left the cycle and has stopped dividing. The cell cycle starts with this phase. The word \"post-mitotic\" is sometimes used to refer to both [[G0 phase|quiescent]] and [[Senescence#Cellular senescence|senescent]] cells. Non-proliferative (non-dividing) cells in multicellular [[eukaryote]]s generally enter the quiescent G<sub>0</sub> state from G<sub>1</sub> and may remain quiescent for long periods of time, possibly indefinitely (as is often the case for [[neuron]]s). This is very common for cells that are fully [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]]. Cellular senescence occurs in response to DNA damage and external stress and usually constitutes an arrest in G<sub>1</sub>. Some cells enter the G<sub>0</sub> phase semi-permanently and are considered post-mitotic, e.g., some liver, kidney, and stomach cells. Many cells do not enter G<sub>0</sub> and continue to divide throughout an organism's life, e.g., epithelial cells.\n\nCellular senescence is also a state that occurs in response to DNA damage or degradation that would make a cell's progeny nonviable; it is often a biochemical alternative to the self-destruction of such a damaged cell by [[apoptosis]].\n\n===Interphase (intermitosis)===\nBefore a cell can enter cell division, it needs to take in nutrients. All of the preparations are done during interphase. Interphase is a series of changes that takes place in a newly formed cell and its nucleus, before it becomes capable of division again. It is also called preparatory phase or intermitosis. Previously it was called resting stage because there is no apparent activity related to cell division.Typically interphase lasts for at least 91% of the total time required for the cell cycle.\n\nInterphase proceeds in three stages, G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>, followed by the cycle of mitosis and cytokinesis. The cell's nuclear DNA contents are duplicated during S phase but may continue till G<sub>2</sub> in case of [[heterochromatin]].\n\n====G<sub>1</sub> phase (First growth phase or Post mitotic gap phase)====\nThe first phase within interphase, from the end of the previous M phase until the beginning of DNA synthesis, is called [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub>]] (G indicating ''gap''). It is also called the growth phase. During this phase, the biosynthetic activities of the cell, which are considerably slowed down during M phase, resume at a high rate. The duration of G<sub>1</sub> is highly variable, even among different cells of the same species.<ref name=\"pmid4515625\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith JA, Martin L | title = Do cells cycle? | journal = Proc.

This [[Cell cycle checkpoint#G1 .28Restriction.29 Checkpoint|check point]] is called the restriction point or START and is regulated by G<sub>1</sub>/S cyclins, which cause transition from G<sub>1</sub> to S phase. Passage through the G<sub>1</sub> check point commits the cell to division.\n\n====S phase (DNA replication)====\nThe ensuing [[S phase]] starts when [[DNA]] synthesis commences; when it is complete, all of the [[chromosome]]s have been replicated, i.e., each chromosome has two (sister) [[chromatid]]s. Thus, during this phase, the amount of DNA in the cell has effectively doubled, though the [[ploidy]] of the cell remains the same.

The G<sub>1</sub> cyclin-CDK complexes also promote the degradation of molecules that function as S phase inhibitors by targeting them for [[ubiquitination]]. Once a protein has been ubiquitinated, it is targeted for proteolytic degradation by the [[proteasome]].

This ensures that every portion of the cell's [[genome]] will be replicated once and only once. The reason for prevention of gaps in replication is fairly clear, because daughter cells that are missing all or part of crucial genes will die. However, for reasons related to [[gene copy number]] effects, possession of extra copies of certain genes is also deleterious to the daughter cells.\n\nMitotic cyclin-CDK complexes, which are synthesized but inactivated during S and G<sub>2</sub> phases, promote the initiation of [[mitosis]] by stimulating downstream proteins involved in chromosome condensation and [[mitotic spindle]] assembly. A critical complex activated during this process is a [[ubiquitin ligase]] known as the [[anaphase-promoting complex]] (APC), which promotes degradation of structural proteins associated with the chromosomal [[kinetochore]].

They halt cell cycle in G<sub>1</sub> phase, by binding to, and inactivating, cyclin-CDK complexes. p21 is activated by [[p53]] (which, in turn, is triggered by DNA damage e.g. due to radiation). p27 is activated by Transforming Growth Factor of \u03b2 ([[TGF \u03b2]]), a growth inhibitor.\n\nThe '''INK4a/ARF family''' includes [[p16 (gene)|p16<sup>INK4a</sup>]], which binds to CDK4 and arrests the cell cycle in G<sub>1</sub> phase, and [[p14arf|p14<sup>ARF</sup>]] which prevents p53 degradation.\n\nSynthetic inhibitors of [[Cdc25]] could also be useful for the arrest of cell cycle and therefore be useful as antineoplastic and anticancer agents.<ref name=\"ref 1\">[http://pharmaxchange.info/presentations/cdc25.html Presentation on CDC25 PHOSPHATASES: A Potential Target for Novel Anticancer Agents]</ref>\n\n===Transcriptional regulatory network===\nCurrent evidence suggests that a semi-autonomous transcriptional network acts in concert with the CDK-cyclin machinery to regulate the cell cycle.

Of the 1,271 genes assayed, 882 continued to be expressed in the cyclin-deficient cells at the same time as in the wild type cells, despite the fact that the cyclin-deficient cells arrest at the border between [[G1 phase|G<sub>1</sub>]] and [[S phase]]. However, 833 of the genes assayed changed behavior between the wild type and mutant cells, indicating that these genes are likely directly or indirectly regulated by the CDK-cyclin machinery. Some genes that continued to be expressed on time in the mutant cells were also expressed at different levels in the mutant and wild type cells. These findings suggest that while the transcriptional network may oscillate independently of the CDK-cyclin oscillator, they are coupled in a manner that requires both to ensure the proper timing of cell cycle events.<ref name=\"orlandoeta1nature2008\" /> Other work indicates that [[phosphorylation]], a post-translational modification, of cell cycle transcription factors by [[Cdk1]] may alter the localization or activity of the transcription factors in order to tightly control timing of target genes.<ref name=\"whiteetal2009\" /><ref name=\"sidorova1995\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sidorova JM, Mikesell GE, Breeden LL | title = Cell cycle-regulated phosphorylation of Swi6 controls its nuclear localization | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 12 | pages = 1641\u201358 | date = December 1995 | pmid = 8590795 | pmc = 301322 | doi = 10.1091/mbc.6.12.1641 }}</ref><ref name=\"ubersaxetal2003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ubersax JA, Woodbury EL, Quang PN, Paraz M, Blethrow JD, Shah K, Shokat KM, Morgan DO | title = Targets of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 | journal = Nature | volume = 425 | issue = 6960 | pages = 859\u201364 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 14574415 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1038/nature02062 | bibcode = 2003Natur.425..859U }}</ref>\n\nWhile oscillatory transcription plays a key role in the progression of the yeast cell cycle, the CDK-cyclin machinery operates independently in the early embryonic cell cycle.

The cell cannot proceed to the next phase until checkpoint requirements have been met. Checkpoints typically consist of a network of regulatory proteins that monitor and dictate the progression of the cell through the different stages of the cell cycle.\n\nThere are several checkpoints to ensure that damaged or incomplete DNA is not passed on to daughter cells. Three main checkpoints exist: the G<sub>1</sub>/S checkpoint, the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint and the metaphase (mitotic) checkpoint.\n\nG<sub>1</sub>/S transition is a rate-limiting step in the cell cycle and is also known as [[restriction point]].<ref name=\"Robbins\"/> This is where the cell checks whether it has enough raw materials to fully replicate its DNA (nucleotide bases, DNA synthase, chromatin, etc.). An unhealthy or malnourished cell will get stuck at this checkpoint.\n\nThe G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint is where the cell ensures that it has enough cytoplasm and phospholipids for two daughter cells. But sometimes more importantly, it checks to see if it is the right time to replicate. There are some situations where many cells need to all replicate simultaneously (for example, a growing embryo should have a symmetric cell distribution until it reaches the mid-blastula transition). This is done by controlling the G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoint.\n\nThe metaphase checkpoint is a fairly minor checkpoint, in that once a cell is in metaphase, it has committed to undergoing mitosis. However that's not to say it isn't important. In this checkpoint, the cell checks to ensure that the spindle has formed and that all of the chromosomes are aligned at the spindle equator before anaphase begins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = LeMaire-Adkins R, Radke K, Hunt PA | title = Lack of checkpoint control at the metaphase/anaphase transition: a mechanism of meiotic nondisjunction in mammalian females | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 139 | issue = 7 | pages = 1611\u20139 | date = December 1997 | pmid = 9412457 | pmc = 2132649 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.139.7.1611 }}</ref>\n\nWhile these are the three \"main\" checkpoints, not all cells have to pass through each of these checkpoints in this order to replicate. Many types of cancer are caused by mutations that allow the cells to speed through the various checkpoints or even skip them altogether. Going from S to M to S phase almost consecutively. Because these cells have lost their checkpoints, any DNA mutations that may have occurred are disregarded and passed on to the daughter cells. This is one reason why cancer cells have a tendency to exponentially accrue mutations. Aside from cancer cells, many fully differentiated cell types no longer replicate so they leave the cell cycle and stay in G<sub>0</sub> until their death. Thus removing the need for cellular checkpoints. An alternative model of the cell cycle response to DNA damage has also been proposed, known as the [[postreplication checkpoint]].\n\nCheckpoint regulation plays an important role in an organism's development. In sexual reproduction, when egg fertilization occurs, when the sperm binds to the egg, it releases signalling factors that notify the egg that it has been fertilized. Among other things, this induces the now fertilized oocyte to return from its previously dormant, G<sub>0</sub>, state back into the cell cycle and on to mitotic replication and division.\n\n[[p53]] plays an important role in triggering the control mechanisms at both G<sub>1</sub>/S and G<sub>2</sub>/M checkpoints. In addition to p53, checkpoint regulators are being heavily researched for their roles in cancer growth and proliferation.\n\n== Fluorescence imaging of the cell cycle ==\n[[File:Far-Red & Near-infrared Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI).gif|thumb|150px|Fluorescent proteins visualize the cell cycle progression.

This fact is made use of in cancer treatment; by a process known as [[debulking]], a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G<sub>0</sub> to G<sub>1</sub> phase (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the debulking procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.<ref name=\"Robbins\"/>\n\nThe fastest cycling mammalian cells in culture, crypt cells in the intestinal epithelium, have a cycle time as short as 9 to 10 hours. Stem cells in resting mouse skin may have a cycle time of more than 200 hours. Most of this difference is due to the varying length of G<sub>1</sub>, the most variable phase of the cycle. M and S do not vary much.\n\nIn general, cells are most radiosensitive in late M and G<sub>2</sub> phases and most resistant in late S phase.\n\nFor cells with a longer cell cycle time and a significantly long G<sub>1</sub> phase, there is a second peak of resistance late in G<sub>1</sub>.\n\nThe pattern of resistance and sensitivity correlates with the level of sulfhydryl compounds in the cell.

It is an essential technique in many types of [[partner dancing]] and is used extensively in partner dances that feature significant physical contact between the dancers, including the [[Argentine Tango]], [[Lindy Hop]], [[Balboa (dance)|Balboa]], [[East Coast Swing]], [[West Coast Swing]], [[salsa (dance)|Salsa]], and [[Modern Jive]].\n\nOther forms of communication, such as visual cues or spoken cues, sometimes aid in connecting with one's partner, but are often used in specific circumstances (e.g., practicing figures, or figures which are purposely danced without physical connection). Connection can be used to transmit power and energy as well as information and signals; some dance forms (and some dancers) primarily emphasize power or signaling, but most are probably a mixture of both.\n\nFollowing and leading in a partner dance is accomplished by maintaining a physical connection called the [[frame (dance)|frame]] that allows the leader to transmit body movement to the follower, and for the follower to suggest ideas to the leader. A frame is a stable structural combination of both bodies maintained through the dancers' arms and/or legs.\n\nConnection occurs in both [[open position|open]] and closed dance positions (also called \"open frame\" and \"closed frame\").\n\nIn [[closed position]] with [[body contact (dance)|body contact]], connection is achieved by maintaining the frame. The follower moves to match the leader, maintaining the pressure between the two bodies as well as the position.\n\nWhen creating frame, tension is the primary means of establishing communication. Changes in tension are made to create rhythmic variations in moves and movements, and are communicated through points of contact.<ref>Joseph Daniel DeMers (2013), Frame matching and \u0394pTed: a framework for teaching Swing and Blues dance partner connection, Research in Dance Education, 14:1, 71 - 80, DOI: 10.1080/14647893.2012.688943</ref> In an open position or a closed position without body contact, the hands and arms alone provide the connection, which may be one of three forms: tension, compression or neutral.\n\n* During '''tension''' or '''leverage connection''', the dancers are pulling away from each other with an equal and opposite force.  The arms do not originate this force alone: they are often assisted by tension in trunk musculature, through body weight or by momentum.\n* During '''compression connection''', the dancers are pushing towards each other.\n* In a neutral position, the hands do not impart any force other than the touch of the follower's hands in the leader's.\n\nIn swing dances, tension and compression may be maintained for a significant period of time.  In other dances, such as [[Ballroom dance|Latin]], tension and compression may be used as indications of upcoming movement.  However, in both styles, tension and compression do not signal immediate movement: the follow must be careful not to move prior to actual movement by the lead.  Until then, the dancers must match pressures without moving their hands.  In some styles of [[Lindy Hop]], the tension may become quite high without initiating movement.\n\nThe general rule for open connections is that moves of the leader's hands back, forth, left or right are originated through moves of the entire body. Accordingly, for the follower, a move of the connected hand is immediately transformed into the corresponding move of the body. Tensing the muscles and locking the arm achieves this effect but is neither comfortable nor correct. Such tension eliminates the subtler communication in the connection, and eliminates free movement up and down, such as is required to initiate many turns.\n\nInstead of just tensing the arms, connection is achieved by engaging the shoulder, upper body and torso muscles. Movement originates in the body's core. A leader leads by moving himself and maintaining frame and connection. Different forms of dance and different movements within each dance may call for differences in the connection. In some dances the separation distance between the partners remains pretty constant. In others e.g. [[Modern Jive]] moving closer together and further apart are fundamental to the dance, requiring flexion and extension of the arms, alternating compression and tension.\n\nThe connection between two partners has a different feel in every dance and with every partner.  Good social dancers adapt to the conventions of the dance and the responses of their partners.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Frame (dance)|Frame]]\n*[[Dance move]]\n*[[Lead and follow]]\n*[[Musicality (dance)|Musicality]]\n\n{{Dance}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Connection (Dance)}}\n[[Category:Partner dance technique]]", "sha1": "41eos1umjhnc5udb87j2wybtxyth1g8"}}, {"title": "Cardiovascular system", "ns": "0", "id": "7256", "redirect": {"title": "Circulatory system"}, "revision": {"id": "829458870", "parentid": "733280449", "timestamp": "2018-03-08T19:38:56Z", "contributor": {"username": "The Transhumanist", "id": "1754504"}, "comment": "Add template to categorize redirect using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[circulatory system#Cardiovascular system]]\n\n{{R to section}}\n\n[[ja:\u5faa\u74b0\u5668\u7cfb]]", "sha1": "3l3oxsu66rlq29js5skvifdvcqa7bp3"}}, {"title": "Caste", "ns": "0", "id": "7257", "revision": {"id": "866678715", "parentid": "866678357", "timestamp": "2018-10-31T21:00:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Thine Antique Pen", "id": "12529706"}, "comment": "remove copyrighted material copied from https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-27774908", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}\n[[File:Basor Dalit caste.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Basor]]'' weaving bamboo baskets in a 1916 book.

The system of ''varnas'' appears in Hindu texts dating back to 1000 BCE and envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmins]] (teachers, scholars and priests), [[Kashatriya]]s (warriors and nobles), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, traders and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (labourers/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the system of ''varnas'' was a theoretical classification envisioned by the Brahmins, but never truly operational in the society. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''j\u0101tis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations. The ''j\u0101tis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status. In many instances, as in Bengal, historically the kings and rulers had been called upon, when required, to mediate on the ranks of ''j\u0101tis'', which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the ''j\u0101tis'' may or may not fit into the ''varna'' classes and many prominent ''jatis'', for example the Jats and Yadavs, straddled two varnas i.e. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, and the ''varna'' status of ''j\u0101tis'' itself was subject to articulation over time.\n\nStarting with the British colonial Census of 1901 led by [[Herbert Hope Risley]], all the ''j\u0101tis'' were grouped under the theoretical ''varnas'' categories.<ref name=dirks>{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7191.html|author=Nicholas B.

According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' (\"people\") and later, ''kungmin'' (\"citizen\").<ref name=\"proper\"/>\n\n====North Korea====\n{{Main|Songbun}}\n\nThe [[Committee for Human Rights in North Korea]] reported that \"Every North Korean citizen is assigned a heredity-based class and socio-political rank over which the individual exercises no control but which determines all aspects of his or her life.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=06 Jun 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/9313174/North-Korea-caste-system-underpins-human-rights-abuses.html |title=North Korea caste system 'underpins human rights abuses' |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}</ref> Regarded as ''Songbun'', [[Barbara Demick]] describes this \"class structure\" as an updating of the hereditary \"caste system\", combining Confucianism and Stalinism.<ref>Barbara Demick, ''Nothing to Envy: Love, Life and Death in North Korea'', Fourth Estate, London, 2010, pp. 26\u201327.</ref> She claims that a bad family background is called \"tainted blood\", and that by law this \"tainted blood\" lasts for three generations.<ref>Demick, pp. 28, 197, 202.</ref>\n\n===Tibet===\n{{See also|Social classes of Tibet}}\n\nHeidi Fjeld has put forth the argument that pre-1950s Tibetan society was functionally a caste system, in contrast to previous scholars who defined the Tibetan social class system as similar to European feudal serfdom, as well as non-scholarly western accounts which seek to romanticize a supposedly 'egalitarian' ancient Tibetan society.\n\n==Middle East==\n{{main|Yazidi}}\n\n[[Yezidi]] society is hierarchical.

The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.<ref name=Obinna1/>\n\nThe ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the \"Osus\" people as \"owned by deities\" and outcasts.\n\nThe Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.africankingdoms.com|title=AFRICAN KINGDOMS - Kingdoms of Ancient African History|website=www.africankingdoms.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|pages=37\u201354|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mand\u00e9]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.\n\nTamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.\n\nAs West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.<ref name=tamari1>{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221\u2013250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}</ref>\n\n===Central Africa===\nEthel M.

Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.<ref>{{cite journal|title=LA CASTE EN AFRIQUE? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M.

It includes structured record types (as in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]) and supports the packing of data into limited storage (also as in Pascal). Like [[Edinburgh IMP]] it allows embedded assembler, and also offers good run-time checking and diagnostics. It is specifically intended for [[real-time computing|real-time]] and embedded applications and for use on computers with limited processing power, including those limited to [[fixed point arithmetic]] and those without support for dynamic storage allocation.\n\nThe language was an inter-service standard for British military programming, and was also widely adopted for civil purposes in the British control and automation industry. It was used to write software for both the [[Ferranti]]<ref name=RSRE799->{{cite report |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA084068 |title=The Coral 66 Compiler for Ferranti ARGUS 500 Computer |last=Gorman |first=B |publisher=Royal Signals and Radar Establishment |date=June 1978 |id=Technical Note 799 |accessdate=17 January 2018}}</ref> and [[The General Electric Company|GEC]] computers from 1971 onwards. Implementations also exist for the Interdata 8/32, [[PDP-11]], [[VAX]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] platforms and [[HP Integrity]] servers; for the [[Honeywell]], and for the Computer Technology Limited (CTL, later ITL) [[Information_Technology_Limited#The_Modular_One|Modular-1]]; as well as for [[SPARC]] running [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Intel]] running [[Linux]].\n\nA variant of Coral 66 was developed during the late 1970s/early 1980s by the British [[General Post Office|GPO]], in conjunction with [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]], STC and [[Plessey]], for use on the [[System X (telephony)|System X]] digital telephone exchange control computers, known as PO-CORAL. This was later renamed BT-CORAL when [[British Telecom]] was spun off from the Post Office. Unique features of this language were the focus on real-time execution, message processing, limits on statement execution between waiting for input, and a prohibition on recursion to remove the need for a stack.\n\nAs Coral was aimed at a variety of real-time work, rather than general office DP, there was no standardised equivalent to a [[stdio]] [[Library (computing)|library]]. IECCA recommended a primitive I/O package to accompany any compiler (in a document titled ''Input/Output of Character data in Coral 66 Utility Programs''). Most implementers avoided this by producing Coral interfaces to existing Fortran and, later, C libraries.\n\nPerhaps CORAL's most significant contribution to computing was the enforcement of quality control in commercial [[compiler]]s. To have a CORAL compiler approved by IECCA, and thus allowing a compiler to be marketed as a CORAL 66 compiler, the candidate compiler had to compile and execute an official suite of 25 test programs and 6 benchmark programs. The process was part of the [[British Standard|BS]]&nbsp;5905 approval process. This methodology was observed and adapted later by the [[United States Department of Defense]] for the official certification of [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] compilers.\n\nSource code for a Coral 66 compiler (written in [[BCPL]]) has been recovered and the ''Official Definition of Coral 66'' document by [[Office of Public Sector Information|HMSO]] has been scanned; the Ministry of Defence patent office has issued a licence to the Edinburgh Computer History project to allow them to put both the code and the language reference online for non-commercial use.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n\n* [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/os/deimos/ercm09/emas-2900/coral2.txt CORAL 66 test program] extracted from the [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/os/emas/users/ercm09/emas-2900/coral.txt Test Responder report]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20041102162930/http://yfroom.8800.org/apps/1750/benchmarks/coral66/ CORAL 66 benchmarks]\n* [http://www.dxc.technology/swep OpenVMS CORAL 66 compiler for HPE Integrity servers, Alpha (AXP) and VAX machines] (commercial working CORAL 66 system)\n* [http://standards.mackido.com/bs/bs-standards24_view_4284.html BS5905] CORAL 66 Standard\n* [http://www.dstan.mod.uk/data/05/047/00000200.pdf DEF STAN 05-47]\n* [http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/computer-science/history/pdp-11/rsx/decus/rsx82b/312022/ PDP-11 CORAL/ASM interfacing library]\n* ECCE [http://history.dcs.ed.ac.uk/archive/os/emas/users/ercm09/emas-2900/coraltrans.txt editor script to translate CORAL 66] into [[Edinburgh IMP]]\n\n[[Category:Procedural programming languages]]\n[[Category:Programming languages created in 1964]]", "sha1": "mcclyocwob0f0ef9w8qsri8n9ancrjx"}}]
